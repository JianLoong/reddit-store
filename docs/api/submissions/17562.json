But she's definitely a poisoned well. Stay away from each other.\n\nETA: revised judgment after reading comments.

Yeah sounds like you\u2019re TA to me. I think /you/  carry that insecurity concerning where you were able to send your son rather than your son. He\u2019s\u2014most definitely\u2014fine with where he ended up, especially since he\u2019s 22. \n\nYou have no idea what your daughter did to get into that school. You weren\u2019t in her life then. She could\u2019ve earned it SOLELY on her own merit. You\u2019re right in that her dad\u2019s money probably made it possible (both kids could\u2019ve gotten in, but only she could\u2019ve afforded to go). But\u2026that\u2019s not really something you say to a young girl who is extremely proud of her (and, yes, HER) major accomplishment. \n\nALSO, small thing: if you\u2019re in the US, your son applied in a profoundly competitive year, which was hard on all applicants.", "ESH. I don\u2019t know how the university admissions process works in your country, so I can\u2019t speak to that. \n\nHowever, she\u2019s terrible and immature for putting down your son like that. \n\nI think you shouldn\u2019t have stooped to her level. In that moment, defending and supporting your son would have meant a lot more and better expresses your pride in his accomplishments than attacking her.", "INFO: did you or the dad move to the different city and how was their relationship facilitated when living apart?", "Yta. Regardless of money it is still an achievement to get into a good university and diminishing that achievement is an asshole move. Especially since you are trying to mend fences any way. Maybe do some self reflection and try to understand why she went no contact with you. It's not nice of her to be rude to your son but worry about your own relationship with her. Your son is a grown man and he can choose whether or not he wants a relationship with her based on her behavior. He is also too old to need you to defend him and his college opportunities. As a mom that is seeking a relationship, you should have been proud of her.", "YTA. Why did you bring your son to such an important meeting anyway?", "ESH - You do not know what she has done to earn her place there and she should not have taunted him... although I wonder if we are missing a part of the story here. It seems odd that she would make fun of him in that way. I wonder if maybe it was misinterpreted (something like \"oh I thought you always wanted to go to XYZ university too\" or if there was a lead up that we are missing.", "YTA - acceptance isn't based on ability to pay - attendance is.  I'm pretty sure your daughter went NC with you on her own account, not her father's influence.", "So you finally got to see your daughter after 5+ years and you aren't nice to her.

You have a strained at best relationship with your daughter, so you figured it was a great idea to insult her scholastic efforts? Great job...", "INFO: do you even like your daughter?", "So I assume this university has competitive admission, and there's strong competition for places (rather than just an auction). Sure, her dad's money enables her to go, but she was admitted on her own merits and not on her bank balance.\n\nYou don't know whether your son would have been admitted, because he didn't apply. You couldn't afford it. So it's not true to say that he \"didn't get in to\" the top university. He never even applied. Perhaps he's good enough to attend the university your daughter studies at, or perhaps not. You don't really know.\n\nESH\n\nAbout the only innocent party here seems to be your son. As far as I can tell from your report, he hasn't done anything wrong.", "NTA I don't understand how everyone is glossing over the fact that she was mocking your son, like it doesn't even matter it was your son but the fact that she would mock someone because they couldn't get into a certain university shows her poor ethics, She is completely in the wrong and honestly after all your efforts to remain in a relationship with her there's no reason to accept her awful behavior, at this point you did what you were supposed to do, now she is a grown up and it's on her if she wants to have a relationship with you.", "ESH", "NTA\n\nShe needed to hear it, especially because it\u2019s so true. I\u2019m sure she worked hard and money wasn\u2019t the *only* reason like you said but it was a huge one and your son probably did too and still couldn\u2019t afford it. University is *expensive* and as someone with parents who are pretty well off, I know good and well to not mock or be condescending towards others and their financial struggles and to instead be understanding and kind no matter their standing, which she should have been. She should have congratulated him for being in college to begin with and not taken it as an opportunity to boost herself. Reminding him was also super obnoxious, I\u2019m sure he knew good and well he wanted to go there if he had the funds to. In my eyes, you stood up for your son, and I see nothing wrong with that.
