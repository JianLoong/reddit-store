She died when my mom was only a child. But she died leaving her husband and oldest daughter deeply traumatized by her behavior and her death. Her younger daughter, my aunt, was too young to remember her or anything about the life she gave her family. My grandmother did a lot of things that left it's mark on the family and my mom especially. To add to everything else my mom is the one who found her mother at just 8 years old. So she has always carried that around with her.\n\nI only found out I looked just like her mother when I was 6 and my aunt told me I was just like her mommy and she was showing me all these photos she had and the childhood ones really showed the resemblance. My made a big point to tell me every single similarity we had.\n\nMy mom never ever made me feel like I wasn't loved or like there was something wrong with me. The only reason I knew something was up was someone she wasn't able to hide the sadness in her eyes when she looked at me. I also did some snooping when I was little and heard her tell my dad about the struggle she had some days to see her mom's face in me.\n\nMy aunt decided to use me to hurt mom. When I was 12 she brought me to get my hair dyed behind mom's back and pushed me to go blonde when I wanted pink hair. Turned out my mom knew their mother as a blonde. I realized that when I saw mom's eyes after seeing me with blonde hair. That was the point where I realized what my aunt was doing.\n\nThere was other stuff before then. Like she'd buy me clothes that were similar to what their mother would have worn (my aunt had a bunch of photos of her mother so she knew the stuff she liked to wear). She gave me a nickname as a little girl and got me so into it I tried to use it with everyone. It was a nickname my grandmother was given by... some people in her life. My mom really hated that name too. I heard her tell dad later that night.\n\nMy mom adored my aunt and thought they were super close so when I did realize what my aunt was doing I made sure to tell her I was on to her and wouldn't be trusting her anymore. She did attempt to do some more fucked up stuff but eventually I told my dad and he told my aunt to leave me the fuck alone.\n\nWe didn't see her for years during Covid or after but then grandpa's birthday happened just before New Years and she approached me and tried to manipulate me into doing the same stuff (change my hair and how I dress, etc). I told her I knew what she was doing and she laughed at the idea of it being to hurt mom. So I lost my temper and made sure everyone heard what she had done when I was a kid and that she was trying to do it again. My dad and some other people there forced my aunt to leave but not before she told me I was such a bitch for spoiling the party and publicly humiliating her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704376064, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ydkof/aita_for_publicly_announcing_that_my_aunt_tried/", "score": 2087, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love my son too, as a completely separate person.\n\nEven so, I sat my mom down and set some hard limits when she was fixating on the physical similarity to the point he was noticing as just a 3 year old.\n\nYour aunt doesn't have any such benign motives as my mom or Google.  Your aunt is being nasty in a very public way.  She wanted to dress you up and parade you in front of your mom in from of other people, depending on their presence to keep your mom quiet.

That a few years of not seeing her would have made you forget that both you AND your dad told her not to pull this sort of thing?", "I'm unsure why you think your aunt is trying to hurt your mom, instead of trying to work out her own trauma in a weird way on you.

If she grew up hardly remembering her own mother being told how amazing she is could it not be possible that she's just noticed how much you look like her and she sees it as getting a piece of her back? If your mother thought they were close maybe she did most of this without considering how your mother might feel maybe even thinking she'd be happier if you looked more like your grandma since your mother got the chance to really know her. She might just have a fucked way of dealing with the grief of never having a mom. I don't know the full story but if that was the only confrontation maybe y'all should sit down and have a hard conversation about why and about setting boundaries.

Not for this specifically, but just in general.", "ESH here but you. I also think everyone is under reacting.\n\nYour parents should've put their foot down the moment they saw what your Aunt was doing. The red flag is big enough to see from space. They had to have said something to your Aunt and she had to just keep on doing it and she kept on doing it because your parents allowed it to continue. Your hair dye example is a big one. It sounds like your Aunt went behind your mom's back to dye your hair without parental permission and never had a consequence. That's a horrible thing to do.\n\nYour parents allowed you to be harmed by allowing the behavior to continue. I'm saying that as a fact and I'm not telling you how to feel about it. I'm using it as an example of your parents needing to keep your Aunt away from you the moment she started this all those years ago.\n\nThe big red flag that you may need to talk to your parents about is that your Aunt may have another motive for dressing you up as her Mom besides to hurt your mother. Your Aunt may have an unhealthy obsession with you and is trying to literally make you into her mother for a reason only known to her. If you think this could be anywhere near the truth, it's a sign of extreme mental illness that needs to be assessed immediately.", "NTA\n\n\nI think your aunt is very ill. Regardless, you were right to call your aunt out. Open family secrets are common in traumatic families. The truth teller may not be believed, but speaking up is never wrong. (Not always smart, but never wrong.)\n\nIf your aunt is ill, that is not your responsibility. The only things that you can do is set up boundaries that work for you, preferably after talking to a therapist, and get therapy, if you can at all. \n\nI come from a family not unlike yours, but let's say I'm more like your mom's generation, closer to the trauma & drama. If your aunt (and I believe your assessment) is doing this with malicious intent, I have no doubt that you have more stories to tell and questions to ask that a therapist can help with.\n\nI want to acknowledge the possibility that your aunt is simply an incredibly selfish person who will put her wants above the needs of others. Selfish people often want to ignore the consequences of their actions, and while calling your aunt out was fully warranted, her response isn't shocking. Some people will change, and some won't. You have nothing to apologise for, and you have no reason to forgive or trust anyone not willing to acknowledge the hurt they caused you.\n\nIn the remote possibility that she's genuinely completely oblivious and unaware that her actions are hurting her sister, and you by extension, she may or may not change. Some people want a hero, even if it's a dead abuser. In my family, two known abusers are still remembered very fondly and publicly. People can have their good memories, but I don't have to listen to songs of praise. \n\nYou know your aunt better than anyone here, but even if you two have had a decent relationship to this point,I hope you consider the possibility that she may not be a safe person to be around. If her behaviour gets more obsessive, intrusive, impulsive, please be very wary. Your aunt doesn't have to want to hurt you to be dangerous, and the malicious intent she's displaying has been going on for years. She will not like the new you.", "NTA...

I don\u2019t know if she was doing it to get under your mom\u2019s skin, it also could be the nostalgia of having her mom around again. Either way is still messed up though.", "> You got your grandmother's looks but it seems your aunt got her personality. Quite the achievement since she never knew her.\n\nI still think most of one's noticeable personal traits are the product of upbringing, \u201csocial inheritance\u201d... But there must be a genetic component too. Perhaps the deeper biological ones, like, sociopathy is a matter of brain structure?", "Exactly what I thought\n\nNTA indeed", "> how do you know your aunt was doing that stuff intentionally to hurt your mom?\n\nShe has known it was hurtful since OP was 12, so at least this recent repeat was fully intentional.", "> how do you know your aunt was doing that stuff intentionally to hurt your mom?\n\nShe has known it was hurtful since OP was 12, so at least this recent repeat was fully intentional.", "Thanks, mental health went from 10% to 100%", "Here, have some Sunni weather to compensate for your Sufiering.", "[deleted]", "I think you\u2019ve misunderstood my comment. \n\nFirst off, I\u2019m a psychologist specializing in trauma and an abuse victim myself. I know there\u2019s never an innocent or \u201cgood\u201d reason to abuse someone. \n\nSecond, I disagree that what the aunt did was abusive. There was no element of fear, humiliation, or degradation. I know you\u2019re not interested in debating this point, but from a psychological perspective, what the aunt did simply doesn\u2019t have the same effect as abuse. It\u2019s still messed up and *not* an okay thing to do, but tbh it kind of diminishes the experiences of abuse victims to lump all mistreatment in the \u201cabuse\u201d category. \n\nFinally, you\u2019re right and the aunts actions are not OPs responsibility, regardless of cause. Furthermore, the aunts behaviour wouldn\u2019t be okay even if it came from a \u201cgood\u201d place. We\u2019re in total agreement there. But based on what OP wrote, it appears that she *assumed* ill intent and I\u2019m wondering how she came to that assumption. There could be a really good reason OP assumed that! But I couldn\u2019t find it in the post, so I\u2019m hoping she provides some clarification", "Thanks", "I assumed it was included in:\n\n> when I did realize what my aunt was doing I made sure to tell her I was on to her and wouldn't be trusting her anymore. She did attempt to do some more fucked up stuff but eventually I told my dad and he told my aunt to leave me the fuck alone.\n\nOP doesn't specify what exactly she and her father said, but A) presumably at least one of them mentioned it; and B) even if neither of them did, Auntie Dear could fucking well conclude it for herself. Why the fuck _else_ would they want her to stop? Either way, she'd clearly been told to stop it. Whatever their reason \u2013 and NGL, it must obviously be because _someone_ found it hurtful \u2013 doing it again makes her quite enough of a massive AH, whoever it was she was hurting. Who exactly it was doesn't make it more or less so.\n\nSo IMO you're barking up a non-existent tree.", "I really don't. I am making a judgement based on events as told. if you don't think what the aunt did was abusive, I'm not going to debate you, but I strongly disagree and I feel what you said was significantly more out of line than what I did. have a good day anyway, goodbye", "I mean, even if her intent was as pure as snow, and she\u2019s just desperate to have a relationship with the mother she never knew blah blah blah, even IF that was 100% true, using a child (and now an adult) to work through your trauma and mommy issues is fucked up and disgusting and she would still deserve to be called out in front of everyone.", "NTA your aunt is manipulating you to hurt your mom", "NTA\n\nI am sorry you were put through this, especially since your likeness to your grandmother is something you cannot control.\n\nI would LOVE to have seen the expression on your aunts face when she was called out.

It sure why you felt the need to ask Reddit.  You dont sound like an insecure person, and this situation is cut and dried as to who TAH is.", "It sounds like your grandma behaved in a way that led to her death, and that she was kind of scandalous.

Except we cant say anything to him because he flips out and gets violent.\n\nMy dad had stage 4 cancer and it got bad enough to where he could barely walk. They even had to put one of those bed things in the living room for him. My mom spent her time in the living room with my dad. She only went to the other room for a little while to go on their laptop. She even slept on the couch every single day, so she could be with him.\n\nOnce my dad passed away, my eldest brother spread rumors that HE was the one taking care of my dad and how my mom ignored my dad and left him on the floor when he fell. He did everything he could to pin me and my older brother against our mom.\n\nHe always made shit up to get at my mom, even though she raised him and my older brother while my dad drove truck.\n\nOne time, he even claimed that my mom tried hurting my older brother. We're all 5 years apart, so when my older brother was little, my mom was cleaning the tub in the upstairs bathroom. She left it to soak and went downstairs. She heard my eldest brother trying to get my older brother to go upstairs with him. \n\nWell, he ended up licking the inside of the tub and had to go to the hospital. He couldnt even eat, it was that bad."]}
