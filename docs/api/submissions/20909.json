My dad had been cheating on my mom, and it only came to light because his mistress (my stepmom) got pregnant and made him choose between her and my mom. Nine months, and one divorce later, my brother Ethan (now 14) was born.  \n\nNeedless to say, my mom isn\u2019t fond of Ethan. She doesn\u2019t hate him, but she doesn\u2019t love him either, or want any type of relationship with him. On the semi-frequently times where she sees him (when she picks me up and drops me off from my dad\u2019s house) she basically ignores him. She avoids making eye contact or ever initiating conversation with him, and when he tries to talk to her, she gives short answers and gets us both on our way asap. \n\nMy dad and stepmom have sheltered Ethan from the past family drama, and it\u2019s always been frustrating, but I figured it wasn\u2019t my place to interfere. Because of that, he didn\u2019t understand why my mom doesn\u2019t like him. He thought it was because she hates my dad (a bit true) and is a cold, resentful old hag who can\u2019t leave the past behind and is jealous of my stepmom (his words exactly from two years ago, and again partially true minus the jealousy, but imo she has a good reason). Before y\u2019all tell me that my mom lied to me about my dad\u2019s affair, he\u2019s admitted to everything as I\u2019ve told it when I pressed him for details some years back. \n\nAnyway, onto the inciting incident. My mom planned a vacation, and of course I was invited, but she also invited my paternal uncle (who took my mom\u2019s side in the family schism that was the affair and divorce and who still remains close friends with her to this day) and his kids. When Ethan found out that his cousins were invited on the vacation but not him, he broke down and came to me asking why my mom hates him so much. He actually broke down crying, I felt so bad for him. I decided that he deserved to know the truth. \n\nI tried to break the truth as gently as I possibly could, but there\u2019s really no good way to tell a sobbing kid that he\u2019s the result of cheating and that\u2019s why my mom never wanted a relationship with him. \n\nThe good side is that he wasn\u2019t crying anymore or mad at my mom, the bad side was that he was really pissed off at his parents. Well, I had to leave for the vacation (I\u2019m actually writing on the flight lol) and my dad and stepmom have been blowing up my phone. They\u2019re furious at me for \u201ctelling him before he was ready\u201d. I let my mom know the situation and she told me that that was \u201ckind of a jerk move\u201d because I dropped a bomb and left them to clean up the mess. Ethan isn\u2019t exactly emotionally mature, and considering the fury that I last saw him in, I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with that clusterfuck either. Now I\u2019m thinking I might have undermined my dad and stepmom\u2019s parenting, and maybe I should have at least waited until after I got back so I could help prevent the implosion that\u2019s going on back home.

The fact that they left it this long and you had to absorb the emotional reaction from him is on them, not on you.  I am sure everyone could figure out a better way to let him know, but there does come a point where a young teen has to just give the information that they know as best they can.  I think you did that.", "NTA. You're a child too, and you witnessed both your brother being heartbroken and your mother being badmouthed. It's a natural reaction and all the adults are being the AH here for not understanding this.\nAlso, if your dad and stepmom would have really wanted to keep him protected, they could have made up a nicer version of the truth instead of letting the boy think he was hated for no reason from his brother's mom. They only thought about themselves, so the clusterf*ck is entirely theirs to deal, rightfully!", "NTA but this is the second step-parent half-sibling drama post in the last two days, hell of a coincidence ain\u2019t it?

Sure, the timing was terrible, but what were you supposed to do? He did deserve to know the truth.", "NTA.", "NTA. Ethan had some choice words about your mother. You are a good son for defending your mother against the lies. Obviously he was being fed some lies by his parents. Please enjoy your vacation.", "NTA, you were trying to placate years of confusion over why Ethan is disliked by your mother for something that is NOT is fault.  The cheaters never win in the end, if their son looks at them differently because they're cheaters, it's solely the CHEATERS' faults.  It's their mess to clean no matter what.  At least Ethan is not wrongfully mad at your mom anymore.", "NTA. You and your mom have been the ones cleaning up the mess for this long already because your dad and stepmom were trying to hide the truth.

Dad and stepmom are just mad their lies are out on the open.", "NTA, your dad and stepmom are. Your mom was at least civil, which is more than some in other situations. They made a mess, so they should clean it up. You just pointed it out is all.", "NTA. I do agree dropping the bomb and leaving on vacation was a bit of a dick move, but your mom cold shouldered this kid for, as far as he could tell, no fucking reason for fourteen years, so she's not really in any position to tell you how this should've been handled. Could you have handled it better or at least timed it better? Sure. But he had every right to know and I think you did the right thing telling him.\n\nAs for \"not old enough to know about it\" yeah, no, if he's old enough to be excluded from family events and old enough to be cold shouldered by your mom every time he sees her (to be clear, not saying that's not understandable) he's old enough to know why.", "Ethan's 14. When would he be ready? \n\nNTA. What were you supposed to say to him? - \"You should go ask dad and your mum, maybe they'll tell you?\".

The anger is due to his parents actions, no one else, it's entirely their responsibility.\n\nDumb thing is if they just casually tell him when he's like 6 he wouldn't even truly understand it, nor be angry. He's just accept it, could be told your mum doesn't hate him and it's entirely his parents fault, let him avoid feeling bad about that or shitting on your mum for it.

I\u2019d be laughing to the bank if I were you.", "NTA,\n\nYou were put in a shitty situation by your father and his wife. 14 is likely old enough to have the conversation with their child especially as he's caught on to what happened.

And that you aren't there to be a buffer.", "NTA\n\nThere is a possibility that he's asked his parents before now, and they've not given him an answer he accepts/believes.

What cleaning up could you have really done?", "NTA. This situation isn\u2019t your fault. He was always going to find out; it\u2019s probably best that he heard it from you and not his parents.", "NTA but your parents definitely are. Your dad is an AH for not explaining the situation to your brother who is more then old enough to comprehend the situation. Your mom is an AH for completely ignoring your brother. It\u2019s been 14 years and she shows her resentment through your brother which is nonsense. I understand her resenting your father for so long but your brother is completely innocent of all of it. She needs to grow up.", "NTA he needed to know and it was only a matter of time", "NTA. The adults should not had keep this a secret. Not your fault.

Your mom for letting her own feelings about his father cloud her ability to be civil to a child. Your dad for letting this continue without trying to help his son understand what was going on. Of course Ethan came to you as someone he trusts who he thought could help him understand why he's excluded. They were cowardly and now they'll have to deal with the consequences of that. Keep being a good sister to Ethan.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and step mom could've avoided this, had they explained Ethan, that he has two parents who are responsible of taking him on vacations and such. Your mother isn't. She can invite your uncle and cousins and it has nothing to do with Ethan. He's been let to trash your mom and act entitled to her time and affections, when your mom seems cordial with him. And now he knows the truth, which your dad and step mom tried to hide way too long. It was easier for them to let Ethan hate your mom without any consequences than tell him the truth.", "NTA.  But your mom kind of is.  It\u2019s been 14 years and it\u2019s not Ethan\u2019s fault.  She shouldn\u2019t be taking things out on him, he\u2019s an innocent party in this.", "NTA, but your mom sure is.  I understand her being hurt and angry at your dad and his mistress/wife.  I understand her not wanting a relationship with Ethan, that isn't her responsibility.  But he is innocent in all of this and shouldn't be treated badly.  If a child asks why someone hates them it is because that person has made it blatantly clear they hate them.  She didn't have to take him on the vacation, of course, but for god's sake grow up and start treating the poor kid with common decency.", "I'm going to be a bit unpopular and say YTA. This was not your story to tell or your mess to fix. You should have turned him in the direction of his parents for answers.

You should of told him to ask his parents.", "Your mother needs to stop taking her resentment out on a child. It's not like he asked to be born. I can understand not wanting to include him in vacations she's pays for, but keeping the close relationship with the ex BIL and his kids to the extent she vacations with them seems suspicious to me. She is playing games, and a 14 year old gets hurt. \n\nOP the adults in your life have created a giant cluster fuck of a mess and I'm guessing haven't always been the best examples of good behavior, that's why I'm thinking NTA. \n\n14-15 years is a long time to be resentful. At this point your mom is choosing to feel this way.\n\nI know several people who have married affair partners and everyone eventually gets over it and acts like adults for the well being of the children involved. Shit happens and you don't punish 14 year olds because of it.", "Are you going to tell a 5 year old santa isn't real either because they're crying when he didn't bring them something?\n\nIt wasn't your story to tell, if you felt it was time for him to know you could have spoken with your father about it first at the very least. \n\nYTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is a lesson learned for you though about thinking through decisions in a more considered way that have big implications on other people\u2019s lives.  Your mom also needs to build a bridge and get over it with regard to this poor kid.  He didnt do anything and she\u2019s obviously so overtly unkind to him that it\u2019s very upsetting and obvious to your brother.  I speak from experience. My son\u2019s father did very similar thing to me - I\u2019m always kind and pleasant to his Dad, his new wife (despite absolutely hating her to my core) and their kids.

If they hadn't explained it by the time he was 14yo, I doubt they ever would have. I would've recommended talking to him around 10 or 11 if it hadn't come up before hand (when he's old enough to start understanding the complexity of relationships). \n\nYou are a good brother for wanting to comfort him.

You cared about his reaction and emotions. At what age is the right age to learn about his origin? \n\nYou're not a jerk either. Your mom, whatever her reasoning may be, shouldn't have taken it out on a kid. Your dad and step mom are just reaping the consequences of their crap behaviors. They're still gonna give you crap but you had your brothers back. At least there's one healthy relationship you can be proud of", "Youre nta\n\nBut youre mom is being unnecessarily cruel to this poor boy, its not his fault his existence comes from an affair, why after 14 is she taking it out on him?", "NTA - This has been a long time coming. He's 14, not 4, and with all this he should have been told before now. All that happened was him (wrongly) blaming your mom and feeling like the odd man out/unwanted without knowing why.\n\nThe entire situation has been unfair to your mom and Ethan both, and that is all because of your father and stepmother. It's their mess they made that everyone now has to deal with, and they should be the ones cleaning it up and apologizing to you, Ethan, and your mother for allowing this underlying false narrative to go on for so long.", "NTA", "They were happy to let the poor kid think there was something wrong with him, rather than explain, in an age-appropriate way, that the two of them hurt OP's mother and that no, she doesn't hate Ethan, but every time she sees him, she is reminded of that pain, so she prefers to avoid him. They could also have told him that she is basically a stranger to him, and that strangers don't owe him love.", "Also it's better that his anger is directed where it should go instead of inward towards himself.\n\nHe thought he was hated but what his mom more than likely hates is what Ethan symbolizes.", "This is the way. Sorry to be that redditor, but this really resonated with me for why I was upset about this whole ass situation", "Oh damn, I didn\u2019t see the other post, that is a weird coincidence lol. You\u2019re right about the way they\u2019ve talked to him about my mom, they\u2019re very manipulative of him about everything regarding my mom. I honestly regret not talking to him sooner, but I kinda feel for my dad and stepmom because they\u2019re going to have a hell of a time now that their lies have blown up in their face.", "How has OP\u2019s mom not been civil to Ethan? She simply refuses to have a relationship with him. Which she is perfectly in her right to do.", "His Mom had no obligation to Ethan, who was likely a painful reminder of a terrible time in her life. It isn't his fault, but she didn't do anything to deserve it either.", "How is she taking things out on Ethan? She simply refuses to have a relationship with him or take him on vacation. She isn\u2019t obligated to do that.", "How is she treating him badly? What common decency is she denying him? She simply is keeping her distance from him.", "Agree. My husband of 25 years left me for his affair partner. If they have a child, I would do my best to have a good relationship with them because they would be my son\u2019s sibling. I would want to foster a happy, healthy sibling relationship despite my feelings for the parents. The child is blameless.", "So his parents could continue to lie to him and make the victim of their affair out to be the villain?", "It's something he would have learned eventually better and now they later. If anything his father was putting him in more emotional distress because he didn't tell him for so long.", "OP hasn't had great role models for good adult behavior.  He's 16, so I cut him some slack.", "I didn\u2019t tell him to ask his parents because I know they would have lied to him as they have before.", "How in the world is OP\u2019s mom the AH? She isn\u2019t obligated to take Ethan on a vacation or form a relationship with him.", "But they probably would have lied to him. he did what he had to do.", "OPs mom isn\u2019t an asshole at all. It\u2019s deeply weird that OPs half brother feels entitled to a relationship with his dad\u2019s ex-wife at all. Even absent any cheating why would there be a relationship there?", "You are ridiculous. Any 14 year old would get bored on vacation alone with mom, so it makes sense to invite kids their age to have a fun vacation with.", "It is better to tell them the truth than to let them think Santa didn't bring them a gift b/c Santa thinks they are a terrible child who doesn't deserve a present.", "The kid is 14, that\u2019s old enough to know about the circumstances of his own damn birth. Besides, his parents have been feeding him a dangerous mentality that he\u2019s owed a relationship with OP\u2019s mom. Better to rip the bandaid off now than later when it boils over with OP\u2019s mom. Also, it ripped OP\u2019s family apart, even if he was a baby at the time his family was irrevocably changed and that makes it his story.", "It is absolutely buckwild the extent to which one has nothing to do with the other here. For one he's 14, not 5, do you really not see any difference in maturity between 5 year olds and 14 year olds? For two how in the fuck does this compare to the Santa myth?", "The kid is 14 he's old enough to know. If anything his parents are doing him more harm by not telling him already.", "They were happy to shit talk OPs mom to Ethan.  Where do you think Ethan got that she was a \"cold resentful old hag\" from? I'd be willing to bet stepmom and/or dad refer to her in that way. \n\nNTA. They never would have told him the truth. It was easier to paint your mom as the bad guy instead of revealing they have been all along.", "I think Ethan was ready since he was so confused. He thought he was the problem. That\u2019s awful bud parents put him in that position. Imagine finding out and realizing that your parents allowed you to think someone hated you for no reason.\n\nAnd then to find out he was shit talking someone who deserves his empathy. And he definitely heard those insults from his parents. Meaning they both put him in a bad position and then allowed for him to say insulting things without warrant to someone who did nothing wrong. That is betrayal. I would be so mad at my parents. And embarrassed.", "Why? Your dad and stepmom absolutely deserve it. This is the consequences of their choices.", "Don\u2019t feel bad, they made their bed and now they have to sleep in it.", "The fact that he knew she hated him, and it bothered him enough to come to you crying, means that your dad and stepmom did a terrible job of looking after his well-being. They needed to deal with it properly well before it got to this point.\n\nYou did a good job of letting him know when he needed it. If you hadn't told him, he would be having a really hard time right now, bottling it up and likely hating himself. \n\nThe explosion that's happening is totally on them and likely significantly better for him long-term than him believing there's something wrong with him.\n\nWhat they're dealing with is a direct consequence of their poor parenting. You did good.\n\nEdit to add NTA.", "Their lies created a web on entanglement that only a therapist can help them now.", "Don\u2019t feel sorry for them because they will lie again to keep your brother under control\u2026 NTA", "Ah, well if isn\u2019t the consequences of their actions.", "Eh, yeah, ideally you probably should\u2019ve taken Ethan to them to have them explain it while you were there so you could keep them from lying, but this was coming down the line in any case. \n\nI\u2019m a little surprised that Ethan didn\u2019t figure this out already. I mean, basic math should have told him his parents started a relationship when your parents were still married.", "> I kinda feel for my dad and stepmom because they\u2019re going to have a hell of a time now that their lies have blown up in their face.\n\nI don't.  They're grown adults who made poor choices, and their choices have consequences.\n\nThey \"weren't ready\" for him to know because they liked keeping their dirty little secret hidden away, where it couldn't come back and bite them.", "Only person you should feel sorry for kiddo is your mum, your dad and Stepmum have created this whole mess by feeding your sibling bs. No one made them talk shit about your mum.", "He\u2019s a human being and a child, she is ignoring him when she sees him.  She shuts down conversation with short answers when he tries to engage with her.  It\u2019s cruel to treat a child like that.", ">On the semi-frequently times where she sees him (when she picks me up and drops me off from my dad\u2019s house) she basically ignores him. She avoids making eye contact or ever initiating conversation with him, and when he tries to talk to her, she gives short answers and gets us both on our way asap.\n\nI treat strangers better than this.  How hard is it to say \"Hi, Ethan\" , look him in the eye, and talk with the CHILD.  \n\nHe is not to blame for this.", "Kid, do not pay attention to these unhinged redditors who know nothing but enjoy to put the blame on the victims. Just ignore them. You are a victim in this situation, your brother is also a victim. This is your parents mess.\n\nYou are not supposed to carry the burden of your parents sins, much less be the strongbox of their secrets. Your brother is 14, not 10, he is able to handle this now.

It is really weird.", "I have kids who are 16 and 18. My kids do just fine with me. I'm sure there are plenty of other people she could invite besides her ex's brother and kids. Ad hominem \"arguments\" are a symptim of a lack of critical thinking skills, just FYI.", "If course that phrase came from them. It's not something a kid comes up with on their own. It's very much something that a jealous, bitter woman would say. For example, a homewrecker who is disappointed that the husband she stole from another woman isn't up to her standards and might possibly still be carying a torch for the love of his life, who he will forever regret losing because he couldn't keep it in his pants.

She is unwilling to engage in conversation. \n\n(2) You aren\u2019t obligated to engage in conversation with someone simply because they want to engage in one with you.\n\nSo, you have engaged in conversation with every child who has wanted to engage in conversation with you? Because, in my experience, that is not how most adults treat children.", "Ignoring him are OP\u2019s words so yeah, I take that to be the case since OP said it was.\n\nAnd yes, you engage with children who are talking to you.  Not doing so is an asshole move.  They\u2019re children, be nice to them."]}
