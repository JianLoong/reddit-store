My dad had been cheating on my mom, and it only came to light because his mistress (my stepmom) got pregnant and made him choose between her and my mom. Nine months, and one divorce later, my brother Ethan (now 14) was born.  \n\nNeedless to say, my mom isn\u2019t fond of Ethan. She doesn\u2019t hate him, but she doesn\u2019t love him either, or want any type of relationship with him. On the semi-frequently times where she sees him (when she picks me up and drops me off from my dad\u2019s house) she basically ignores him. She avoids making eye contact or ever initiating conversation with him, and when he tries to talk to her, she gives short answers and gets us both on our way asap. \n\nMy dad and stepmom have sheltered Ethan from the past family drama, and it\u2019s always been frustrating, but I figured it wasn\u2019t my place to interfere. Because of that, he didn\u2019t understand why my mom doesn\u2019t like him. He thought it was because she hates my dad (a bit true) and is a cold, resentful old hag who can\u2019t leave the past behind and is jealous of my stepmom (his words exactly from two years ago, and again partially true minus the jealousy, but imo she has a good reason). Before y\u2019all tell me that my mom lied to me about my dad\u2019s affair, he\u2019s admitted to everything as I\u2019ve told it when I pressed him for details some years back. \n\nAnyway, onto the inciting incident. My mom planned a vacation, and of course I was invited, but she also invited my paternal uncle (who took my mom\u2019s side in the family schism that was the affair and divorce and who still remains close friends with her to this day) and his kids. When Ethan found out that his cousins were invited on the vacation but not him, he broke down and came to me asking why my mom hates him so much. He actually broke down crying, I felt so bad for him. I decided that he deserved to know the truth. \n\nI tried to break the truth as gently as I possibly could, but there\u2019s really no good way to tell a sobbing kid that he\u2019s the result of cheating and that\u2019s why my mom never wanted a relationship with him. \n\nThe good side is that he wasn\u2019t crying anymore or mad at my mom, the bad side was that he was really pissed off at his parents. Well, I had to leave for the vacation (I\u2019m actually writing on the flight lol) and my dad and stepmom have been blowing up my phone. They\u2019re furious at me for \u201ctelling him before he was ready\u201d. I let my mom know the situation and she told me that that was \u201ckind of a jerk move\u201d because I dropped a bomb and left them to clean up the mess. Ethan isn\u2019t exactly emotionally mature, and considering the fury that I last saw him in, I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with that clusterfuck either. Now I\u2019m thinking I might have undermined my dad and stepmom\u2019s parenting, and maybe I should have at least waited until after I got back so I could help prevent the implosion that\u2019s going on back home.

The fact that they left it this long and you had to absorb the emotional reaction from him is on them, not on you.  I am sure everyone could figure out a better way to let him know, but there does come a point where a young teen has to just give the information that they know as best they can.  I think you did that.", "NTA. You're a child too, and you witnessed both your brother being heartbroken and your mother being badmouthed. It's a natural reaction and all the adults are being the AH here for not understanding this.\nAlso, if your dad and stepmom would have really wanted to keep him protected, they could have made up a nicer version of the truth instead of letting the boy think he was hated for no reason from his brother's mom. They only thought about themselves, so the clusterf*ck is entirely theirs to deal, rightfully!", "NTA but this is the second step-parent half-sibling drama post in the last two days, hell of a coincidence ain\u2019t it?

Sure, the timing was terrible, but what were you supposed to do? He did deserve to know the truth.", "NTA.", "NTA. Ethan had some choice words about your mother. You are a good son for defending your mother against the lies. Obviously he was being fed some lies by his parents. Please enjoy your vacation.", "NTA, you were trying to placate years of confusion over why Ethan is disliked by your mother for something that is NOT is fault.  The cheaters never win in the end, if their son looks at them differently because they're cheaters, it's solely the CHEATERS' faults.  It's their mess to clean no matter what.  At least Ethan is not wrongfully mad at your mom anymore.", "NTA. You and your mom have been the ones cleaning up the mess for this long already because your dad and stepmom were trying to hide the truth.

Dad and stepmom are just mad their lies are out on the open.", "NTA, your dad and stepmom are. Your mom was at least civil, which is more than some in other situations. They made a mess, so they should clean it up. You just pointed it out is all.", "NTA. I do agree dropping the bomb and leaving on vacation was a bit of a dick move, but your mom cold shouldered this kid for, as far as he could tell, no fucking reason for fourteen years, so she's not really in any position to tell you how this should've been handled. Could you have handled it better or at least timed it better? Sure. But he had every right to know and I think you did the right thing telling him.\n\nAs for \"not old enough to know about it\" yeah, no, if he's old enough to be excluded from family events and old enough to be cold shouldered by your mom every time he sees her (to be clear, not saying that's not understandable) he's old enough to know why.", "Ethan's 14. When would he be ready? \n\nNTA. What were you supposed to say to him? - \"You should go ask dad and your mum, maybe they'll tell you?\".

The anger is due to his parents actions, no one else, it's entirely their responsibility.\n\nDumb thing is if they just casually tell him when he's like 6 he wouldn't even truly understand it, nor be angry. He's just accept it, could be told your mum doesn't hate him and it's entirely his parents fault, let him avoid feeling bad about that or shitting on your mum for it.

I\u2019d be laughing to the bank if I were you.", "NTA,\n\nYou were put in a shitty situation by your father and his wife. 14 is likely old enough to have the conversation with their child especially as he's caught on to what happened.

And that you aren't there to be a buffer.", "NTA\n\nThere is a possibility that he's asked his parents before now, and they've not given him an answer he accepts/believes.

What cleaning up could you have really done?", "NTA. This situation isn\u2019t your fault. He was always going to find out; it\u2019s probably best that he heard it from you and not his parents.", "NTA but your parents definitely are. Your dad is an AH for not explaining the situation to your brother who is more then old enough to comprehend the situation. Your mom is an AH for completely ignoring your brother. It\u2019s been 14 years and she shows her resentment through your brother which is nonsense. I understand her resenting your father for so long but your brother is completely innocent of all of it. She needs to grow up.", "NTA he needed to know and it was only a matter of time", "NTA. The adults should not had keep this a secret. Not your fault.

Your mom for letting her own feelings about his father cloud her ability to be civil to a child. Your dad for letting this continue without trying to help his son understand what was going on. Of course Ethan came to you as someone he trusts who he thought could help him understand why he's excluded. They were cowardly and now they'll have to deal with the consequences of that. Keep being a good sister to Ethan.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and step mom could've avoided this, had they explained Ethan, that he has two parents who are responsible of taking him on vacations and such. Your mother isn't. She can invite your uncle and cousins and it has nothing to do with Ethan. He's been let to trash your mom and act entitled to her time and affections, when your mom seems cordial with him. And now he knows the truth, which your dad and step mom tried to hide way too long. It was easier for them to let Ethan hate your mom without any consequences than tell him the truth.", "NTA.  But your mom kind of is.  It\u2019s been 14 years and it\u2019s not Ethan\u2019s fault.  She shouldn\u2019t be taking things out on him, he\u2019s an innocent party in this.", "NTA, but your mom sure is.  I understand her being hurt and angry at your dad and his mistress/wife.  I understand her not wanting a relationship with Ethan, that isn't her responsibility.  But he is innocent in all of this and shouldn't be treated badly.  If a child asks why someone hates them it is because that person has made it blatantly clear they hate them.  She didn't have to take him on the vacation, of course, but for god's sake grow up and start treating the poor kid with common decency.", "I'm going to be a bit unpopular and say YTA. This was not your story to tell or your mess to fix. You should have turned him in the direction of his parents for answers.

You should of told him to ask his parents.", "Your mother needs to stop taking her resentment out on a child. It's not like he asked to be born. I can understand not wanting to include him in vacations she's pays for, but keeping the close relationship with the ex BIL and his kids to the extent she vacations with them seems suspicious to me. She is playing games, and a 14 year old gets hurt. \n\nOP the adults in your life have created a giant cluster fuck of a mess and I'm guessing haven't always been the best examples of good behavior, that's why I'm thinking NTA. \n\n14-15 years is a long time to be resentful. At this point your mom is choosing to feel this way.\n\nI know several people who have married affair partners and everyone eventually gets over it and acts like adults for the well being of the children involved. Shit happens and you don't punish 14 year olds because of it.", "Are you going to tell a 5 year old santa isn't real either because they're crying when he didn't bring them something?\n\nIt wasn't your story to tell, if you felt it was time for him to know you could have spoken with your father about it first at the very least. \n\nYTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is a lesson learned for you though about thinking through decisions in a more considered way that have big implications on other people\u2019s lives.  Your mom also needs to build a bridge and get over it with regard to this poor kid.  He didnt do anything and she\u2019s obviously so overtly unkind to him that it\u2019s very upsetting and obvious to your brother.  I speak from experience. My son\u2019s father did very similar thing to me - I\u2019m always kind and pleasant to his Dad, his new wife (despite absolutely hating her to my core) and their kids.

If they hadn't explained it by the time he was 14yo, I doubt they ever would have. I would've recommended talking to him around 10 or 11 if it hadn't come up before hand (when he's old enough to start understanding the complexity of relationships). \n\nYou are a good brother for wanting to comfort him.

His parents should have fessed up when he first started asking why she was so dismissive of him. They could have saved him a lot of emotional distress had they let him know that he was a result of their affair and he should never expect anything from her.", "NTA\n\nWhy does he care what your mom thinks of him?

They are not only cheaters, but they lied to him for years to protect themselves. Not to protect him, to protect them. They are despicable, and manipulative, so I won't spend more time detailing how shitty they are, except to say their behavior has been repulsive for at least 15 years and still very much is.\n\nHowever, I must partially agree with your mom:\n\n>she told me that that was \u201ckind of a jerk move\u201d because I dropped a bomb and left them to clean up the mess.\n\nObviously, it's their mess, because they created this terrible situation by their wrongdoing. I couldn't give AF about them having to deal with the consequences of their terrible actions and decisions over the years.\n\nBut your decision to speak up at that moment precisely had an impact on your half-brother. It was probably easy to guess that he would be deeply emotionally affected by this very major news, that you told him just before leaving him to deal with this. I don't care that you left \"them\" (Ethan's parent) to clean up the mess, but I still think it's not great that you left Ethan to deal with the mess in his life and heart while you went your merry way to enjoy holiday. Had you wait upon your return to tell him, he would have had his half-brother by his side while dealing with this very hurtful news.\n\nIt would have been kind to your brother to wait after getting back from holiday to tell him. If only because he'd have had his half-brother by his side to deal with it. He comes to you, because he trusts you and feel that you will be there to support him in hard times, like siblings do. Don't blame yourself to harshly though, I get it as I tend to react quickly in emotional situation and probably would have done the same. But you might want to have an open-hearted conversation about the whole thing with Ethan upon coming back home. Especially if you value your sibling as much as I suspect you do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, his parents are astronomically worse than you could probably ever be in your lifetime and there is no question on that.", "\u201ctelling him before he was ready\u201d\n\nDon't they mean telling him before THEY were ready?

As someone with a stepmother who has been cold and distant from the moment we met (when I was about 12) for no discernible reason, thinking as a child that a presumably mature adult just dislikes you and can\u2019t even pretend to fake it can seriously fuck with your self esteem.

Ethan was more than ready to hear the truth.

That means you were probably even younger than Ethan when you had that conversation with your father.  Ethan's parents have done him no favors by sheltering him from the truth.  He's an innocent child mixed up in all of this, and he's gone his entire life wondering what's so terrible about him that makes your mother dislike him to the degree that she does.  I guarantee you he was relieved to hear that it wasn't about what he had done, but about what your father and stepmother did.  Now he's finally upset with the right people, and it isn't your fault that they don't want to deal with the consequences of their own actions.", "NTA. Exact same situation in my family. Dad got his secretary pregnant, divorced my mom, and married my stepmom ~after~ the kid was born. We were raised by my mom who told us the truth at an age-appropriate time. Dad, on the other hand, lied about the year he and my stepmom married. That way, it seemed like their first kid was born a year after they got married instead of the week before. My half-siblings never knew the truth until they were adults and found some of the divorce/marriage records. It caused drama, but all of us siblings/half-siblings love each other and stay in touch. Also, dad and stepmom were married for over 50 years before death did them part. As much as what dad did sucked, I can\u2019t deny that dad and stepmom were meant to be together.", "NTA.\n\nBut I feel your mom might be a bit of an AH if her treatment of a child who's blameless in this whole affair made him break down crying and asking why she hates him so much.", "NTA.It is better for your brother to know the truth than to think he is at fault.

They could have nipped this in the bud by telling your brother an edited version of what happened, something like \"The divorce was messy, and because of that, OPs mom doesn't want to be involved in our family.  That is OK and we need to respect that and not show anger because of it.\"  \n   \nBut they thought it would be easier to lie, and because of that, they now get to deal with the blowback.", "NTA but I mean at 14 he couldn't do the math? The truth is usually the ultimate defense but if you knew he would flip put is a bit of a AH move", "NTA kiddo! You did what your father and stepmother should have done but were ashamed of. Because they are ashamed of themselves. They know what they did.", "NTA. i've been the younger sibling in a situation where the truth was withheld from me and it made everything so so much harder on me. you did the right thing, and you've given him time to process this information and work through it. you are a wonderful older brother.", "NTA but you would do well to convince your mum to ease up on the poor kid.\nI fully understand that he is a constant reminder of what happened but Ethan is completely innocent.\nShe shouldn't punish him for what his mum and dad did.", "You are NTA. You are 16 years old and you were put in an awful position when your brother came to you in tears. You handled the situation as best you could. Was it perfect? No. But it was honest and it was the best that could be expected of you in this situation.\n\nWhat could you have done differently? You could have gone to your Mom and your Dad, and talked to them about what Ethan is going through. And then, if they as adults didn\u2019t handle the situation with Ethan and told him the truth, then you could have told him.\n\nBut, I honestly think my suggestion requires a level of maturity and courage to confront your parents that is beyond what could or should be expected of you. The whole situation is unfair to not only Ethan, but to you, too.\n\nSo, who are the AHs? Certainly your Mom isfor how she treats Ethan AND YOU. Ethan is, after all, your brother. I don\u2019t understand why she deliberately undercuts the relationship between you and your brother. I think something could have been worked out to include YOUR BROTHER on a family vacation that includes his and your paternal uncle.\n\nYour Dad and Stepmom are AHs for not talking to Ethan before he came to you upset. As soon as Ethan found out about this trip, I\u2019m sure your Dad and Stepmom were aware he was upset. There have probably been lots of times in the past Ethan has been upset by your Mom\u2019s treatment of him. Ethan should have been told the truth before now in a loving but honest manner.\n\nLastly, your paternal uncle is a soft AH for not stepping up for Ethan when he was invited on the vacation and Ethan wasn\u2019t. Your uncle should have made it clear to your Mom she needs to be nice to Ethan because he\u2019s YOUR BROTHER.\n\nAs for you dropping the bomb and then immediately leaving to go on vacation - I don\u2019t blame you. But, since you and your brother are apparently surrounded by immature and selfish adults, it is important that you be a caring brother to Ethan. I\u2019m sure you are a good brother to him. Keep up the good work!", "NTA - He came to you crying demanding the truth. What are you supposed to do?", "NTA. You\u2019re both kids and the adults in your life shouldn\u2019t be asking you to cover up their dirty deeds.", "NTA but i gotta admit I'm confused on what exactly Ethan wanted from your mom. He has his own mom. What role exactly is he expecting her to fill? What does he expect her to do for him?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nthey made shit decisions and now they just have to deal. Their kid is overdue for an explanation, if only as a lesson in life of how to not behave. They\u2019re just mad because they want him to see themselves as good people but they\u2019re not.", "NTA but the timing was definitely off. I would\u2019ve at least waited until after the vacation as you\u2019ve expressed at the end of this AITA.\n\nYour dad and stepmom are assholes for allowing Ethan to feel the way he did about your mother for so long (the same mother who actually cares for Ethan\u2019s feelings \u2026she doesn\u2019t sound bitter towards him to me!)", "NTA. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Dad and step mom made this mess literally. They can clean it up", "Your rebuttal: \"I didn't make the news. I only reported it.\" NTA", "NTA. If they didn't want their kid to know that he was a result of an affair, then they never should have had sex to begin with.", "NTA.\n\nYou told him the truth, which is more than his cheating parents did.", "NTA, but your mom and dad (and stepmom) are.   Ethan is a child, it's not his fault your dad cheated on your mom.  Her continually taking out her frustration and anger on an innocent child is a real asshole thing to do.   On top of that, your dad and stepmom allowing Ethan to think it's his fault your mom isn't mature enough to not take out her own bad feelings on an innocent child is also an asshole thing to do. All of your parents should honestly be embarrassed by their behavior.", "All the parents suck, even your mom. Who hates a child for what the parents did? I am an affair child. And it SUCKED being hated by my half siblings for \u201cruining their family.\u201d\n\nI HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.", "NTA. Can\u2019t believe you waited so long.  Plus, he probably figured it out and had a feeling long ago.  Shielding people from the truth hardly ever ends well.", "NTA but your stepmom, dad, and mom all are. Your stepmom and dad for lying so long. And your mom for taking her hurt on a poor child who had no decision in the matter.", "NTA but I feel bad for Ethan because his parents lied to hum", "I work at a HS and i can tell you that a lot of parents avoid accountability and honesty. They want their kids to think they're perfect and raw dogging a married man isn't exactly perfection.", "NTA what an amazing truth bomb to set off before flying away into the sunset haha", "NTA\n\nThey had plenty of chances to tell him and instead shit talked your mom who only ever tried to be polite but also conscious of her own boundaries. Sure kinda a jerk move and could\u2019ve been done at another time but you\u2019re not at fault for his parent\u2019s shitty decisions", "NTA.  No reason why 100% innocent Ethan should have to continue suffering in confusion to protect his AH parents, who should have been open about the family dynamic by now.", "NTA. They\u2019ve had 14 years to tell him their way, and he asked you. He\u2019s obviously picked up what I assume is your step-mom\u2019s sh*t-talking of your Mom (in my experience men don\u2019t typically call women \u201chag\u201ds). They\u2019re obviously more concerned about saving your step-brother\u2019s positive opinion of your father than understanding the situation - not telling kids just makes your Mom look like the bad guy. Thankfully you know what happened and they didn\u2019t poison you against your Mom.", "So your dad was perfectly comfortable telling YOU the details when you where around Ethan's age, but somehow thinks he's not ready?? Good Lord these people are dicks.\n\nYou're definitely NTA you should not be expected to keep adults secrets.", "NTA. I\u2019m in the mindset that if he has been actively talking trash about your mum for years than it was long overdue. \nI wouldn\u2019t been able to be silent from the comment you quoted from two years ago.", "NTA. The ones not ready for the truth to come out were your father and stepmother. And to be honest, they would\u2019ve never been ready. It was much easier to lie to Ethan and demonise your mom than admit that they were awful people who wrecked a family for their selfishness and that he was an affair baby that heralded shattering of your family. No\u2026it was much easier to lie and victim blame and who cares about the position that puts you and your mom in, right? /s\n\nChin up kid. None of this is neither your, your moms or Ethan\u2019s fault. His parents simply have a history of deplorable decisions that are now coming due. It\u2019s their mess to clean up and make amends for.

Kinda fucked me up as a\nKid, it was very strange since there is a lot\nOf divorce in my family and everyone has gotten over it. My moms ex would actually take me on vacation with his kids.

Ethan was ready and, frankly, his parents should have been slowly working him towards the reality of the situation.  \n\n\nBecause let's face it here: for YEARS your mother has been distant and cold with him, making zero effort to forge any kind of connection.

OP\u2019s mom should have treated him like she would any other kid of acquaintances: with a bare minimum of kindness and warmth.\n\nThe adults in this situation don\u2019t come off as incredibly mature, they should grow up and keep their kids out of their drama.", "For hating a child that did nothing wrong, especially when he did nothing to her. He didn\u2019t ask to be born and an ADULT should never be offended at a CHILD for BEING ALIVE. **Especially** not strongly enough to treat the *literal child* like shit.", "I'd have to disagree. Yes, it isn't the kid's fault, but OP's mom isn't under any obligation to have a relationship with his half brother. Not only is he not her kid, he's the result of her ex husband cheating on her. Its not like OP's mom is going out of her way to insult or hurt Ethan either, she just keeps her distance and doesn't want to have a relationship with him, which is perfectly fair given the circumstances.", "It doesn't seem like OP's mom is going out of her way to purposely hurt the brother though. She's just keeping her distance and doesn't want to form a relationship with him, which in my opinion is perfectly fine given the circumstances. \n\nI have a friend who is in a similar situation, just without the cheating. He has an older brother who was from his mom's first marriage, and he has no relationship at all with his brother's dad because, well, that's his brother's dad, not his. Even if there was no cheating here, OP's mom still wouldn't be an AH for not wanting a relationship with Ethan.", "I hadn't considered that. It is so depressing. I hate this fucking country.", "right? how many ex-wife\u2019s are cool with their ex\u2019s current wife \ud83d\ude2d it\u2019s not a lot even if everything was right ( I.e no cheating/ new wife\u2019s nice and kind)", "Definitely from them. And not just because of his age--what reason would he have to think that she resents him? That would imply he did something hurtful to her, which he had no reason to believe at that point.", "Although I agree with the most of it, she didn't stole anyone. Man are not toys, you can't STEAL them. They choose to be stolen. \nOP, NTA.", "Or you know the dad said it. Because this is exactly the kind of thing men love to say about ex-partners. But let\u2019s spin a wild narrative and make sure to make the other woman the villain and skip over the cheater who actually did something wrong. It\u2019s always more fun to blame a woman.", "OP handled this situation a lot more maturely for someone at 16. I KNOW for a fact that if I were in OP's shoes and my half brother called my mom a resentful old hag, that kid would've found out exactly why my mom didn't like him and not in the nicest way too. \n\nalso seeing OP think about how this would undermine the parents' parenting is kind of sad too because why does a 16 year old need to be thinking like that already :/ \n\nand L parents for letting Ethan believe it was something HE did that made the mom not like him when it was all their fault.\n\nNTA", "Good pick up, I noticed that too. OP is being parentified.", "Hag? Is that a term kids are using nowadays? I\u2019d expect that from someone my 70 yo mom\u2019s generation.", "I\u2019m not sure she was being rude. Probably hurt, hoping the kid would get a clue and stop forcing interactions on her. But I don\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t just wait in the car away from him rather than stepping into that house.", "Apparently he was 12, whe he said that. Tweens aren't exactly known for their wisdom and I can see him say that out of frustration and because he heard his parents say that. A knee-jerk reaction to the hurting if you will.", "Why? Not her kid. I don\u2019t understand the expectation that the ex has to like or entertain their cheating ex\u2019s kid or any ex\u2019s kid for  matter just because he\u2019s related to their child. The parents could\u2019ve told their son a long time ago not the bother the ex when she comes to get her own child. That\u2019s the polite thing to do and would save the kid some anguish too.", "I was around his age 20 years ago. We definitely would have been saying the more colorful words, not \u201cold hag.\u201d Maybe 50 years ago, but not 20. That phrase came from his parents, for sure.", "If, after *14 years,* she still can\u2019t bear to even *look* at this *literal child* who has done absolutely nothing wrong, she needs to go to therapy and get over herself. OP\u2019s brother is a CHILD. It is completely unacceptable for his mom to take out her anger at her ex husband on him. In no world whatsoever is it \u201ctaking the high road\u201d when she\u2019s ignoring this kid and treating him as disposable and filth to be avoided as much as possible, to the point where he breaks down sobbing because he feels like there is something inherently broken about him because of the way she has treated this literal child for the past *decade and a half.* You seriously see no fault in that?\n\nEdit: and regarding her not having a relationship with the kid\u2014whose fault is that? No one\u2019s fault but her own. You don\u2019t have to like your ex husband to not treat your child\u2019s brother like dog shit on the bottom of your bare foot.", "Lol. We did not talk like that 20 years ago. Not as teens. No way. He definitely heard her called that and simply repeated it.", "Kinda but not really related but my little sister is about 14 years younger than me and not the result of the relationship that killed my parent\u2019s marriage, but also kinda sorta associated, since my late step-mom was apparently one of the women who used to \u201cchase after\u201d my dad but he was cheating on my mom with a different one, who barely lasted a year after having him full-time\u2026 anyway\u2026 after step-mom passed when my sister was only five, my dad thought it was a fantastic idea to try and persuade my mother to have some kind of role in my sister\u2019s life\u2026 like because my mother is the mom of my sister\u2019s two brothers already, it would be totally logical and not at all weird for her to like take on a motherly role with the kid her ex-husband had with a woman ten years his junior who used to openly flirt with him for years at work and then somehow got pregnant like 3-1/2 months after their first real date\u2026 and it was totally by accident and she \u201cdidn\u2019t know how\u201d because she was \u201con birth control\u201d and also supposedly didn\u2019t know she was until like 12 weeks because her Prozac messed with her cycle etc so it was too late to do anything\u2026 *cough* trap baby *cough* \n\nHonestly, I grew to love my stepmother and losing her was devastating to many of us, and you\u2019ll notice I refer to my sister as my sister, no half, but the fact that anyone thought it was even a little bit of a good idea for my mom to be involved in raising my sister in any way just blows my mind and the circumstances around her arrival are strange and sus, but happened seven years after my parents split, and was nowhere near as contentious as OPs parents split\u2026 so it kinda doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that someone would think OP\u2019s mom should be treating his little brother like family and I do know a lot of people who treat their ex\u2019s kids from other marriages like family for their kids\u2019 sakes but this situation sounds like one where the dad and stepmom very clearly know that wasn\u2019t ever happening\n\nInterestingly, my bf\u2019s dad had a kid from his first marriage, who bf\u2019s mom treated like part of her family, even after dad and her divorced\u2026 she has a better relationship with my bf\u2019s mom (her ex-stepmom) than she had with her father and she, her husband, and their two kids are at every family event with us because she\u2019s their sister, even though she shared no blood with my bf\u2019s mom and she was non-custodial step-mom for the 15 years she was married to their dad", "I swear, we are in the worst of all possible time lines. Really hoping for a space-time continuum reset."]}
