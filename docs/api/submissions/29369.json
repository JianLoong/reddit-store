He knows how much I was abused by my mother. He made dinner which was nice, but while we were eating he suddenly said he had a dream of having sex with my mother twice and laughed loudly.\n\nI got nauseous and couldn't eat anymore. I said I didn't want to hear that, especially while eating. He said he cannot control his dreams and I had some crazy ones too. I agreed I had and I am not offended because he had such a terrible dream, but I didn't want him to tell me and having dinner was the worst time to bring this up.\n\nHe said I am being dramatic and ruining the dinner he made, and I should man up and eat and that's not a big deal. I said it is a big deal for me. He laughed at me and I asked him to take the plate away and make me coffee. He whined I should do it myself, but I was still nauseous and he agreed and did what I asked.\n\nThere was no yelling or escalation, but boyfriend didn't agree he did something wrong and he didn't apologize, even though I asked him to. It's been two hours and I still feel shaken, and he asked \"what's wrong\". I said he knows what's wrong and he rolled his eyes, but didn't say anything.\n\nI know I have issues and I have been working hard to resolve them, but I want to ask him never mention such dreams again, eating or not. I am not sure that's the right thing to do. I know I am being dramatic, but was I too overly dramatic by refusing to eat and asking him to make me coffee so I could get better?  Was I TAH by telling him I didn't want to hear it even if it's just a stupid dream and I haven't asked him not to tell such dreams? Was it wrong to ask him to apologize?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I didn't mention my age because I want to hide my identity for this profile. I am in my middle thirties, close to my boyfriend's age.

Hard to get the full picture from a summarized reddit post though so just going with my interpretation of what was presented.", "a dream is not a secret. that kind of dream is psychotic anyway", "To be clear, I didn\u2019t ask that thinking you would. I don\u2019t think you would do that either. I don\u2019t think most people would do that to somebody they claimed to love, respect, and care for. It\u2019s markedly cruel, there\u2019s no feasible scenario where him disclosing that benefits you or your relationship at all.\n\nPeople say Reddit tells everyone to break up. I think what Reddit actually does is put several fresh sets of eyes on situations where red flags and toxic behavior patterns have worked their way in slowly so that the people in the relationship simply have an inaccurate read on how bad it\u2019s gotten.", "i\u2019m not making assumptions, i\u2019m quoting you to yourself and letting you know how it sounds.\n\nFeel free to add the additional information to your post and you\u2019ll get less \u201cassumptions\u201d", "At a certain point you need to hold traumatized people accountable for their own actions. It\u2019s pretty common for victims of abuse to become abusers themselves. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a different version of the story told from the perspective of OP\u2019s boyfriend.", "That very well could be the case! just reading it like she wrote it. I hope she leaves him if the relationship is unhealthy.", "i\u2019m sorry if i misgendered you OP i will make the edit", "Ah sorry, when you said he said man up plus the very first line seemed like you were saying both male... my apologies!", "Ok you sound like a very difficult person and your boyfriend was probably taking a shot at you.", "I've said the wrong thing at the wrong moment in a relationship before, but I've never doubled down and laughed at my partner's visceral reaction. The dude's sadistic. This isn't just a disagreement. A disagreement is arguing about whether to buy a new car or save for a down payment on a house.", "My thoughts exactly. It's very telling that she included his age but not her own.", "I don't want anyone to know who I am, so I am not disclosing everything, but I am around the same age, middle thirties.", "I know what you are talking about, but no, I am in my middle thirties. When I said I am 17, it was in a very specific subreddit that has nothing to do with this post.", "Why are you here then?", "Oh, so you're just fucking stupid.", "Lmao ok bye. Maybe you go read the post and maybe get some empathy while you're at it.", "There are also things going on with some people that might interfere with them registering something like that wouldn\u2019t be a good thing to say as well. I agree there\u2019s no real way of knowing, your interpretation is valid. \n\nBlaming someone for the way you feel and then behaving or saying something you know will get you what you want, would most definitely be manipulation. \n\nBut if she was just simply asking and being honest about how she felt, I would not consider that manipulative. Asking to also have her plate cleared as well, could be adding to the opinion that it\u2019s being done manipulatively. But if you\u2019re already feeling nauseous, the smell or even sight of food would potentially make that worse. So one would naturally have asked to have it be removed. And since he\u2019s the only one in the room, he would be the only one to ask. \n\nShe never stated she felt he should do those things because he caused her to feel the way she felt. She stated, after he countered, that she was asking because she still felt nauseous. And after she said that, he agreed. \n\nIf she left out that she told him that he should, because he made her feel that way, that would change things. But I see no evidence in what she posted that she even felt that way.", "Jesus. You *really* think it's abusive to request a minor accommodation for a physical symptom of abuse *that was triggered by the person of whom you're requesting the accommodation* and who *knowingly and willingly laughed about it despite being informed that the victim was uncomfortable about it*?\n\nReally?\n\nSeriously?\n\nAll because the saintly mocker-of-abuse performed the Herculean task of *making dinner*?\n\nYou seem to be missing a very common pattern of abuse itself-- doing something nice for someone, then claiming that they must put up with your behavior because you did a nice thing. You are willfully overlooking the evidence right before your very nose because \"well maybe the OP's boyfriend thinks differently about what he did,\" and you are *performing the very logic of abuse.* You do not get to accuse ANYONE of being abusive when you are literally using abuser logic. \n\nNobody has an obligation to be \"appreciative\" of someone who immediately turns around and leverages their \"kindness\" into an opportunity to hurt them, especially when such a \"kindness\" is the bare minimum of consideration that one would show for a partner. Kindness does not excuse cruelty. To be truly kind, you must be kind *and not also cruel.*\n\nHeaven help us if a man *making dinner* becomes an excuse for him to be as cruel as he wants.", "> hold traumatized people accountable\n\nFor *what???* Being upset your partner told you a story about how he dreamed about fucking your abuser and then invalidating you for rightfully being uncomfortable with it? He laughed at her discomfort and tried to act like she was ridiculous for rightfully being uncomfortable. \n\nShe is not evil like you are trying to paint her for asking him to take a damn plate away. If you jumped to that massive conclusion then you should never get into relationships because you seem like the type of person to make your partner miserable over the smallest things.\n\nAlso, she does not have to be grateful he made her dinner after he invalidated her trauma and then acted like she was irrational for getting upset about it. You don't get to hurt someone then cry because they're not grateful you did the bare fucking minimum.", "I don't mind being called a man, no worries, I don't understand why people make such a big deal out of my gender. It's all ok.", "Pretty sure OP has DID so I think we can forgive them for any inconsistencies from past posts.", "Yeah. It sounds like he has contempt for her.", "Ah OK well I'll delete that comment then if that's true, people here are concerned about your relationship because the things ur saying aren't normal. Now my question is do u really like this guy or do u just not wanna be single because you're in your mid-30s now, and it would be awkward to get in the dating game at that age. I domt think you understand how disgusting what he said to you was and how did you mother abuse you because if it was sexual and hes saying things like that....he is evil", "Wait why were you pretending to be underaged", "I am not pretending to be underage! I said I am 17 in a very specific subreddit, they knew what I was talking about and what my real age is - mid thirties.", "Ah, alrighty then"]}
