He also has a daughter (15f) from his previous marriage. We have been living together in my house for the last two years which my grandparents gifted me after I finished my masters degree because they decide to move to nursing home.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and his daughter moved in, I made it very clear that I do not want any cats or dogs. I don't hate animals but I don't like pets and these furry animals shed a lot of hair which will ruin the antique furniture in the house. I also don't want any responsibility of taking care of them. My sister wanted a dog for the longest time but when she got one she wouldn't take him for walks or make sure his bowl was filled with water and food so I had to carry that mental load. It was also a nightmare having to travel anywhere. Bf and stepdaughter knew these terms and accepted before they moved in.\n\nWhen I came home from work last week, my stepdaughter surprised me with a husky pup. I'm not a dog expert but I know this breed sheds. I asked her how did she get this dog and she said her daddy decided to get her one as a reward for getting good grades. I was angry and confronted my bf. He said it's not a big deal and stepdaughter will take care of the animal. I told him he has two days to rehome the pup or I'll do it. He called my bluff so after two days I decided to take the pup to my cousin's farm. His son has several dogs so the pup will be in good company over there.\n\nMy stepdaughter was crying day and night when she found out. My boyfriend also called me a bitch for taking a pet away from a child but I don't care. It's my house and it's my rules. My bf's family have since been blowing up my phone calling me an evil stepmother for what I did but I don't think I did anything wrong.

What an asshole.\n\nLike I love dogs and have two of my own, but if someone says absolutely no dogs in their house it should just be no dogs. If the bf had a problem with this he should have talked to you first; not to mention if your main problem is shedding, why the hell did he get a God Damn husky of all dogs??", "Well, what you should have done is give THEM 2 days to leave, WITH the dog. NTA, such things need to be agreed on by all parties.", "NTA- you already said there would be no animals when he moved in. He went and used his daughter to try and guilt you into something and that Is very very wrong. That poor girl has to go through that because of her father not because of you. He knew you told them this and got it anyway thinking you wouldn\u2019t do anything since he got it for her. He didn\u2019t even talk to you about it. So it,sucks for the girl but you did the right thing and her feelings are not your responsibility when he did this. He will keep trying to do that same stuff if you allowed the dog to be there especially one that sheds. It is your home, your rules and you told them this from the beginning and they basically don\u2019t care. Don\u2019t back down and don\u2019t bring the dog back or get a new one. Block everyone blowing you up about it too. If he wants to get her dog, tell him to get his own  place..", "NTA  \n\n\nI came here thinking i was going to be calling you a huge AH but wow. Your bf is extremely disrespectful and I honestly would get out of that relationship, he knew how you felt, ignored your boundaries, then called you a bitch and told his family. You don't have to put up wtih that, and you deserve to be treated better.", "NTA\n\nJust end the relationship. With this level of disrespect from your boyfriend, this relationship will never work.", "NTA\n\n1) Any pet is something everyone who lives there has to agree to. You established this was never on the table.\n\n2) A husky is a high maintenance breed, being energetic and hard to train. Does your stepdaughter have any experience around raising or training dogs? What was the plan for when she was at school? Huskies don't do best on their own. If this is her first dog and she doesn't have an active lifestyle she and your bf didn't do much research beyond what looks cute.\n\n3) The no pets rule is not a new thing, your bf and his daughter have known for the two years they've lived there. She's known this puppy for less than a week, and a farm will be a far better environment for it anyway.", "NTA\n\nDogs aren't some prize for getting good grades, they are a huge responsibility and burden to a household. \n\nYour household, it's beyond disrespectful that your bf did this and he should he ashamed for being so rude.\n\nYou did the right thing, and I would consider the type of person who just brings a dog into a house so casually and against others wants. So rude.", "NTA. Tell him to pick up the dog from your cousin after he finds his new place.", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear NO PETS.\n\nLike you say your house your rules. If he does not like it he can also move out as well.", "NTA. Dog fur on furniture is the least of your worries with a husky. They are smart but stubborn, so they are difficult to train. They are a working dog breed, so they need physical exercise and mental stimulation, or they will get bored and become destructive. Which means your furniture is in way more danger than with tufts of fur. They are also very loud dogs.\n\nBf is the AH for getting a dog at all, but **a husky**?? Double the AH. Also an AH for his daughter, since she's now sad **because of him**.\n\nOP, are you sure you want to live with this man for the rest of your life? Or even the next week. He showed you how much he respects you, which is not much at all. First he got the dog despite knowing how you feel about it, secondly he didn't believe you would get rid of it, which also shows he doesn't really know you. What do you get out of this relationship?", "NTA, especially because getting a pet should have been a joint decision.  Double not TA because you had made your stance perfectly clear.", "NTA\n\nWho gets a dog without discussing it with their SO, particularly when it\u2019s their SO\u2019s home?\n\nYou have a boyfriend problem. I suggest addressing it before it grows bigger. Communication has broken down and your boundaries are being trampled.", "You never surprise anyone with a puppy, and the whole household needs to be in agreement. NTA. Your boyfriend was the asshole.\n\nAlso huskies are the stubbornest and noisiest breed of dog.\n\n\\~\\~\n\nSD is 15. In three years, she's going to be leaving for college, and it is highly unlikely that she will be able to take the dog with her. It'll get left with dad and stepmom.", "NTA. \n\n>I made it very clear that I do not want any cats or dogs.\n\nAt some point, your bf decided that you weren't really serious, and figured that it was better to beg for an apology than ask permission, apparently under the impression that if it was disguised as a gift to his daughter, you'd cave.   \nHe thought wrong.", "NTA. But I think it's time for you to reevaluate the relationship. If he's willing to stomp all over your boundaries, how else is he going to disrespect you? It's like he's already decided that you have NO say in the home you own!", "NTA. Why on earth would your BF do that after you were so clear about your wishes?!  Especially a  husky which sheds a ridiculous amount. And in your house!  He clearly has zero concern for your desire, or his daughter as he thinks it's cute to set the two of you against one another.  This is a devious or thoughtless man.  Careful!", "NTA. Why are you still with the boyfriend after this much disrespect?", "NTA, she had this for two days, it was not like you took away a pet she had for years.  Time to kick the two of them out as well.", "What are you doing with someone with such poor judgment and so little respect for you?  \n\nThe daughter is the real victim here.   Her dad led her to believe she could have a dog, even though he knew she couldn't.  And then she lost her dog.  An inevitable terrible loss to her as set up by her dad's thoughtlessness.\n\nI'm not saying you should have kept the dog, but the fact that you don't care a whit about the child's pain tell's me a lot about how compassionate you are.  Or aren't.\n\nSo I'm going with ESH.  Except for your stepdaughter and the dog. (An extremely high maintainance dog that requires endless excercise and attention; shedding would be the least of your problems if BF doesn't know a lot about training dogs.)", "ESH\n\nBiggest AH is your boyfriend; no one should bring a pet into a home unless all parties agree to it. You were very clear that you didn\u2019t want a dog, and he went against that. \n\nWith that said, the dog was not yours to give away. And the biggest harm done was to your stepdaughter, whose only crime was receiving and being happy with her gift of a puppy. You had other options to take before resorting to theft.", "I honestly don\u2019t think you and your bf are a good fit. Yes, he\u2019s an AH for the dog. But your whole \u201c my house, my rules\u201d, attitude reeks of control, and whenever he wants something you are going to pull it out, that he has no power in the home he lives in. It doesn\u2019t sound like either of you are operating in a partnership here. You both seem to do what you like and what is best for you individually not as a couple, let alone a family.", "ESH.\n\nYour bf should have respected your rules, but you acted like an ass also by stealing the dog. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like neither of you respects the other.", "ESH. \n\nIn the end, the dog wasn't yours to give away or for you to choose the new owner (which you conveniently chose someone in your family). You committed theft since dogs are property and put yourself and your cousin in the position of legal trouble if your boyfriend chooses to go that way. Your partner is the biggest AH for not discussing this with you and getting your agreement on a new animal. \n\nThe only 100% innocent person here is the teenager stuck in the middle of this mess. Neither of the adults in her life treated her kindly or with love or consideration.", "ESH. Yes, your bf is the worst for this whole thing, but I think your proper move was telling him they all need to leave if he doesn't get rid of the dog. You shouldn't have taken it upon yourself, and the dog might have been taken by someone in the bf's family.\n\nEDIT: actually, given what he did, you might consider asking them to leave no matter what.", "Themz tha rulz. I mean it was stated beforehand, and you gave them both warning. So technically, NTA. \n\nBut you do seem really uptight. I\u2019d still resent the hell out of you as either bf or his daughter for not giving the daughter a chance even if you\u2019d stated no pets beforehand. \n\nOn the other hand, your bf did this behind your back knowing you wouldn\u2019t approve and hoping to back you into a corner with a fait accompli. So AH move there. But he was also trying to make his daughter happy, so not a total AH.", "ESH. Your house, your rules. But tossing it away to your side of the family was pretty careless. Now every time she's around your family she's going to have to think about how they get to share that love with that dog instead of her because you gave it to them. She's going to grow up thinking that no matter what she does, you care about your nephew and your furniture more than your stepdaughter. \n\nLife is too short to love furniture more than people.", "I kind of think ESH.\n\nSure, your house, your rules. Your BF was wrong. But for this 15 year old at least, well, this is her home. If this attitude and singlehanded decision making comes through in other ways I don\u2019t think that\u2019s compatible with partnership and family life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But for waiting 2 days so your SD had time to bond with the pup.", "NTA. Look I'm not a big fan of the no pets rule. But you laid down the boundaries before moving in. And your bf just ignored them. Like, without even consulting you or talking about it. He figured you'd just accept it and let it happen and that's a huge red flag. I can't imagine doing something like this to a partner. Huskies are working dogs, as well. They go nuts if they don't have a job. A farm is a great place for a husky.", "NTA\n\nFor me the AH is this girl's father who just placed a dog in another home.

I don't think the pup will benefit from switching homes a lot and i have a faint suspicion the bf and his daughter absolutely don't have a clue what they are getting themselves in to when taking in a husky.", "Exactly. This was going to be my comment as it would not be fair to the daughter if she really wanted the dog back. Of course, that would mean them having to get their own place. Hopefully the nephew is older and would understand.", "Or that they can visit the dog at OP's nephew's farm. It can't be more than a few hours away.", "It's the OP's house, her name is on the deeds and she has a right to say no dogs allowed. The person who brought the puppy in didn't think much past that it's cute. The first thing is that huskies are not low maintenance, there's also that this is a puppy and what would happen when the stepdaughter turned 18 and went to college? Huskies do not do best with dorms.", "The teenager is 15, not 5.

In her own house nonetheless\n\n>you conveniently chose someone in your family).\n\nBecause they have dogs and a big yard", "OP gave him a fair warning: either he gets rid of the dog, or she will. He did not.", "The BF did this knowing her stance, he's basically forcing her to choose between damaging her relationship with the stepdaughter or the dog. I say that's an incredibly asshole move.\n\nUptight or not, she has a right to her own house. Dogs are a lot of work and husky most certainly will shed like a motherfucker. If they (mostly the BF) wanted a dog that badly they should have conferred with her first to discuss it.", "> is too short to love furniture more than people.\n\nLike hell it is. \n\nShe is 15 and knew the no dogs allowed rule.\n\nLol, r/puzzleheadTrip blocked me... \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nShe is 15. Old enough to understand. And no, her whining is not more important than op's furniture. We're not talking about her life.

Yeah, i agree. She should kick them out of the house, it's obvious they don't respect her", "She gave them two days to get rid of it they refused.", "I never said she can't say no dogs allowed. I said she can't hand over property to her cousin and say \"the puppy is yours now\" when she didn't purchase the dog and it was not her dog (property) to do anything with. She can ask the owners of the dog to leave with the dog. She can refuse to allow the dog in the house. She can't give the dog away anymore than she can give away anything else in the home that belongs to her boyfriend or his child.", "And she gave him a window of time to do so. He didn't, so OP found a solution to best benefit the dog.", "It's a puppy husky too, combining a naturally high energy breed with a high energy stage of life.", "She didn't get the dog, her dad did. Also step off, I'm not here to debate and shouldn't have to defend myself :) People are more important than someone's shitty rich furniture. \n\nBlocked because of being petulant at other people. Not called for. You're no flower.", "I think it was obvious, they wouldn\u2019t obey. BF disrespected her by getting the pup in the first place so safe to say he wouldn\u2019t return him. \n\nSo why don\u2019t say \u201eether dog moves right now or all of you can get out right now\u201c? There wouldn\u2019t  have been a chance SD had time to bond. I feel really sad for her.", "If boyfriend objects, he's single and homeless.", "Yep, kids really shouldn't be expected to take care of huskies. It's not fair to the kid or the dog.\n\nNot to mention dogs aren't a gift for good grades! Pets should be heavily discussed ahead of time as a household.", "In general a pet like a cat or a dog should be if the person taking care of it has experience and/or a sense of responsibility of raising a pet. The fact it's a husky suggests neither applies here. A dog in general is a huge responsibility and expense, as well as a huge time long term investment. Stepdaughter is doing regular school hours, plus extra curriculars, homework and social life. She's not going to have the time to train a husky and I sure hope dad planned to foot the bill.\n\nOn a farm it has space, people around 24/7 used to training and working with animals, and other animals to socialise with. Maybe if the farm is close enough stepdaughter can visit the husky, spend time without the responsibility of it or the issue of a dog in OP's home coming up."]}
