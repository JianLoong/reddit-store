We have been living together in my house for the last two years which my grandparents gifted me after I finished my masters degree because they decide to move to nursing home.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and his daughter moved in, I made it very clear that I do not want any cats or dogs. I don't hate animals but I don't like pets and these furry animals shed a lot of hair which will ruin the antique furniture in the house. I also don't want any responsibility of taking care of them. My sister wanted a dog for the longest time but when she got one she wouldn't take him for walks or make sure his bowl was filled with water and food so I had to carry that mental load. It was also a nightmare having to travel anywhere. Bf and stepdaughter knew these terms and accepted before they moved in.\n\nWhen I came home from work last week, my stepdaughter surprised me with a husky pup. I'm not a dog expert but I know this breed sheds. I asked her how did she get this dog and she said her daddy decided to get her one as a reward for getting good grades. I was angry and confronted my bf. He said it's not a big deal and stepdaughter will take care of the animal. I told him he has two days to rehome the pup or I'll do it. He called my bluff so after two days I decided to take the pup to my cousin's farm. His son has several dogs so the pup will be in good company over there.\n\nMy stepdaughter was crying day and night when she found out. My boyfriend also called me a bitch for taking a pet away from a child but I don't care. It's my house and it's my rules.

What an asshole.\n\nLike I love dogs and have two of my own, but if someone says absolutely no dogs in their house it should just be no dogs. If the bf had a problem with this he should have talked to you first; not to mention if your main problem is shedding, why the hell did he get a God Damn husky of all dogs??", "Well, what you should have done is give THEM 2 days to leave, WITH the dog. NTA, such things need to be agreed on by all parties.", "NTA- you already said there would be no animals when he moved in. He went and used his daughter to try and guilt you into something and that Is very very wrong. That poor girl has to go through that because of her father not because of you. He knew you told them this and got it anyway thinking you wouldn\u2019t do anything since he got it for her. He didn\u2019t even talk to you about it. So it,sucks for the girl but you did the right thing and her feelings are not your responsibility when he did this. He will keep trying to do that same stuff if you allowed the dog to be there especially one that sheds. It is your home, your rules and you told them this from the beginning and they basically don\u2019t care. Don\u2019t back down and don\u2019t bring the dog back or get a new one.

With this level of disrespect from your boyfriend, this relationship will never work.", "NTA\n\n1) Any pet is something everyone who lives there has to agree to. You established this was never on the table.\n\n2) A husky is a high maintenance breed, being energetic and hard to train. Does your stepdaughter have any experience around raising or training dogs? What was the plan for when she was at school? Huskies don't do best on their own. If this is her first dog and she doesn't have an active lifestyle she and your bf didn't do much research beyond what looks cute.\n\n3) The no pets rule is not a new thing, your bf and his daughter have known for the two years they've lived there.

So rude.", "NTA. Tell him to pick up the dog from your cousin after he finds his new place.", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear NO PETS.\n\nLike you say your house your rules. If he does not like it he can also move out as well.", "NTA. Dog fur on furniture is the least of your worries with a husky. They are smart but stubborn, so they are difficult to train. They are a working dog breed, so they need physical exercise and mental stimulation, or they will get bored and become destructive. Which means your furniture is in way more danger than with tufts of fur. They are also very loud dogs.\n\nBf is the AH for getting a dog at all, but **a husky**?? Double the AH. Also an AH for his daughter, since she's now sad **because of him**.\n\nOP, are you sure you want to live with this man for the rest of your life? Or even the next week. He showed you how much he respects you, which is not much at all. First he got the dog despite knowing how you feel about it, secondly he didn't believe you would get rid of it, which also shows he doesn't really know you.

It'll get left with dad and stepmom.", "NTA. \n\n>I made it very clear that I do not want any cats or dogs.\n\nAt some point, your bf decided that you weren't really serious, and figured that it was better to beg for an apology than ask permission, apparently under the impression that if it was disguised as a gift to his daughter, you'd cave.   \nHe thought wrong.", "NTA. But I think it's time for you to reevaluate the relationship. If he's willing to stomp all over your boundaries, how else is he going to disrespect you?

Especially a  husky which sheds a ridiculous amount. And in your house!  He clearly has zero concern for your desire, or his daughter as he thinks it's cute to set the two of you against one another.  This is a devious or thoughtless man.  Careful!", "NTA. Why are you still with the boyfriend after this much disrespect?", "NTA, she had this for two days, it was not like you took away a pet she had for years.  Time to kick the two of them out as well.", "What are you doing with someone with such poor judgment and so little respect for you?  \n\nThe daughter is the real victim here.   Her dad led her to believe she could have a dog, even though he knew she couldn't.  And then she lost her dog.  An inevitable terrible loss to her as set up by her dad's thoughtlessness.\n\nI'm not saying you should have kept the dog, but the fact that you don't care a whit about the child's pain tell's me a lot about how compassionate you are.  Or aren't.\n\nSo I'm going with ESH.  Except for your stepdaughter and the dog.

And the biggest harm done was to your stepdaughter, whose only crime was receiving and being happy with her gift of a puppy. You had other options to take before resorting to theft.", "I honestly don\u2019t think you and your bf are a good fit. Yes, he\u2019s an AH for the dog. But your whole \u201c my house, my rules\u201d, attitude reeks of control, and whenever he wants something you are going to pull it out, that he has no power in the home he lives in.

You both seem to do what you like and what is best for you individually not as a couple, let alone a family.", "ESH.\n\nYour bf should have respected your rules, but you acted like an ass also by stealing the dog. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like neither of you respects the other.", "ESH. \n\nIn the end, the dog wasn't yours to give away or for you to choose the new owner (which you conveniently chose someone in your family). You committed theft since dogs are property and put yourself and your cousin in the position of legal trouble if your boyfriend chooses to go that way. Your partner is the biggest AH for not discussing this with you and getting your agreement on a new animal. \n\nThe only 100% innocent person here is the teenager stuck in the middle of this mess. Neither of the adults in her life treated her kindly or with love or consideration.", "ESH. Yes, your bf is the worst for this whole thing, but I think your proper move was telling him they all need to leave if he doesn't get rid of the dog. You shouldn't have taken it upon yourself, and the dog might have been taken by someone in the bf's family.\n\nEDIT: actually, given what he did, you might consider asking them to leave no matter what.", "Themz tha rulz. I mean it was stated beforehand, and you gave them both warning. So technically, NTA. \n\nBut you do seem really uptight. I\u2019d still resent the hell out of you as either bf or his daughter for not giving the daughter a chance even if you\u2019d stated no pets beforehand. \n\nOn the other hand, your bf did this behind your back knowing you wouldn\u2019t approve and hoping to back you into a corner with a fait accompli. So AH move there. But he was also trying to make his daughter happy, so not a total AH.", "[deleted]", "I kind of think ESH.\n\nSure, your house, your rules. Your BF was wrong.

They are double coated and one of the highest shedders, daily brushing and vacuuming is a must along with regular grooming, a good diet, access to a variety of toys and activities and decent training. Puppies need to be trained and house broken, including regular trips outside to use the bathroom, that can\u2019t be managed when she is at school and you are at work. That\u2019s a massive ask for a 15 year old who has never had a dog before and she wouldn\u2019t be capable of handling it.\n\nThe puppy would be miserable, lonely, bored and anxious which means stressed behaviour including destroying stuff. Huskies are smart working breeds, they are pack dogs not solo dogs, they need company and training and stuff to do. \n\n\nThe dog is better off where it has room to run and experienced dog owners. Aside from anything, this is one of the only house rules and the audacity of your BF breaking it makes me pretty concerned about his common sense and the way he treats you.", "NTA\n\nYou made the animal rule abundantly clear.

Your boyfriend is the problem. He went back of his promise to you and not only that but chose a huge hairy dog. I love dogs, I dumped my ex because he didn\u2019t want me to replace my dog, but I would not want to share house with a husky. I don\u2019t enjoy the shedding. I can\u2019t even imagine what he was thinking. Maybe if he had gotten her a small non shedding dog he might have somehow had a tiny chance of hoping it would work out, but a Husky? No way. \n\n'What he has done is sabotaged your relationship. Either he fixes this so you are not evil stepmom or he moves out.  If I was 15 I would probably never forgive you for \u201cgiving my dog away\u201d.

They are sled  dogs, meant to run hundreds of miles in snow.  They need constant stimulation or they will destroy the house. And as for shedding... they have a double coat. Many owners pay to get their huskies groomed by experts because it's not an easy task to keep the dog's coat in good condition.\n\nYou've done the dog a favour by re-homing him to a farm.", "ESH. The limit you had a right to set was rehome the dog or move out. It wasn't your dog to rehome. Just end the relationship and tell him to move if he can't respect your boundaries.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is one though. Buying that dog was so disrespectful to you it is crazy and a major red flag. Calling you a bitch and turning his daughter and family against you for a poor choice he made is a second red flag. Doing absolutely no research on the type of dog he chose is also a red flag, Huskies are stunning dogs, but also one of the most demanding breeds out there. \n\nYou are providing a roof over his and his daughters heads it seems for free, he repays that kindness by disrespecting you and making you a Disney villain in his families eyes?

He was told to take it away that day.  She also needs to kick them out as well.  But that is a lot harder than getting rid of a dog.", "YES! They require so much exercise!", "Is anyone ever prepared for a husky?

That's hobosexual logic you got there.", "Her grandparents gave the house to her. It\u2019s hers.", "That is basically just all greyhounds :) the big ones just take up more of the sofa!", "We had cockapoos growing up and while we were responsible for walking them daily, if one was missed, they were fine. They're pretty chill lazy dogs. Smart too.\n\nNot all dogs need 8 walkz a day, lol. 8 seems insane to me.", "At least when OP took it to the farm upstate, it wasn't a euphemism...", "it absolutely is theft. she didnt buy it. she stole it. therefore its theft", "That\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean a landlord can steal something and give it away. That\u2019s not how it works.", "As I said in my first comment, she\u2019s not the AH for standing her ground, but she should have done it right there and don\u2019t give him more then an hour to give the dog back.", "My blue heeler was as much as I could handle.", "I have had and adored Shelties. Have a friend who had, when we met, an Australian Shepherd pup, roughly equal on the \u201chigh intelligence high energy\u201d scale. When she posted a meme with a cute puppy indicating the first year, a dignified dog indicating age 3 and up, and a T-rex for 1-3 (the more intelligent breeds tend to have a more obvious \u201cyou are physically grown but your brain is still doing some wild leaps\u201d period and \u201cyoung adulthood\u201d is explained to be still a lot of work, thus the extra year).\n\nMy dog has since died (9 days short of 15). She was my service dog because her intelligence and our bond and figuring out how to distract her from the new trouble she found ended with her having the tasks. My friend lives in a country where service dogs need a certificate from an approved school, which Covid delayed but the dog did complete. Maybe not as skilled and steady as if they weren\u2019t locked away from the public for 2 years (high risk). \n\nMuse now has a little brother and she posted the memory. He\u2019s not in T-rex mode yet he\u2019s just doing the \u201cMum\u2019s the best but I was sploring and made a mess\u201d stuff not the \u201cI am exploring crossing the limits love Mum but really, she doesn\u2019t know everything\u201d teen/YA phases. \n\nThe malamute one of our trainers used as demo dog came with many \u201chigh maintenance (due to energy/intelligence) breed\u201d stories (opposed to \u201cgrooming needs\u201d or \u201cthey can\u2019t breathe, have shoddy hips, etc\u201d breeds.

Otherwise I pity your partner \ud83d\ude04\n\nSurely wanting to live with someone = wanting to share a home with them. And the definition of share is \u201cto use, occupy, or enjoy (something) jointly with another or others.\u201d", "So if anyone ever moves into their partner\u2019s property, they deserve no opinion on anything, and are automatically a hobosexual?", "the greyhound we fostered liked to stretch out and take up the entire couch!", "huskies definitely need the exercise, and a lot of working dog breeds will need multiple walks at least while theyre young, but yeah there are so many breeds that dont need a lot of walks, and plenty of breeds where a large yard would be enough for exercise. a husky is an insane dog to bring into a home with someone who doesnt want a dog", "And cockapoo\u2019s don\u2019t shed- well mine doesn\u2019t anyway. He\u2019s so chilled and sweet natured, only negative is that he does need regular grooming.", "Indeed. (What\u2019s the bet it didn\u2019t come from a reputable breeder? Wait, you\u2019d be on a wait list and pay real money, and they\u2019d take it back)", "It is not theft.  She has merely moved the possession to a safer place, because she didn't want to store it at her place.  If you bring something into my house that I don't want and I have previously told you not to do that, that I could put it outside the door. In this case as a living animal is involved, she has moved it to a place where it is being cared for and told them (I assume) where it is.", "She didn't steal it because it's a living being not a thing.

But I agree with the other comments that she should have rehomed all 3 together.", "Landlords can take possession of contraband items", "Our friends adopted a dog from the shelter. The wife was all, \u201cOh she\u2019s the sweetest rat terrier!\u201d On IG. I realized the dog was at least half blue heeler, how TF did she not realize that, and we are going to hear years of her complaining about this poor dog.\n\nYep, one week in she realized how high maintenance the dog is and they have spent lots of money on training and boarding. Highly anxious new dog+highly anxious wife and kid+anxious older dog at home=\ud83d\udca5. No wonder new dog prefers her quiet, steady husband. \n\nWe\u2019ve had Aussies-one perfectly tempered, another highly anxious. Aussies and Blues can be amazing dogs but they often need a ton of time.", "Yes she can share her home\u2026 but it\u2019s still her home.

But he unilaterally decided to get a dog knowing she did not want one. Pets are a 1 no, 2 yes, situation.  Aside from the fact that it is a house that was gifted to her by her grandparents, and even if they were to marry, and divorce, would still remain solely and her ownership, she mentioned that it is full of valuable items that she does not want damaged. Puppies are notorious for chewing on things, especially huskies! The furniture would be a definite target.", "Not how that works. I don't get to \"move\" your possessions to a different place at my leisure either. It was not HER possession and that's the important part\n\nWhether it's cared for there is of no consequence, it's not as if her stepdaughter was neglecting it in any way shape or form.\n\nHell if a guy did this you guys would not support him at all and ESH would be the go to. Alongside various accusations of being controlling, intolerant, not compromising, etc. \n\nThe Dad is an asshole, but so is OP. The kid isn't at all, and while Dad and Op are better off splitting, the dog needs to be given back to the kid ASAP.", "Pets are property. It\u2019s absolutely theft of stepdaughter\u2019s property. This has evil stepmother written all over it.", "A dog isn\u2019t contraband. Are you really this stupid?", "And they need the space to RUN!!!!!\nI had small kids to herd (which helped, but also meant I was always home, so, she got lots of attention) and we lived rurally so we were able to let her run out anything she needed to. Balls, sticks, just the zoomies in giant circles around the field.... And oh boy did she love it when someone in the house took up distance trail running.", "aww. my last dog was we think red heeler/rat terrier, and he was my heart. he was dumped at the shelter 3 times before I adopted him. people have no idea what they're getting into with sporting and working breeds. he was an angel as long as he was actually having his needs met.", "I have had 2 Shelties, as I explained in another comment here. Friend with an Aussie pup when we first met (a FB group did a rare \u201cif you\u2019re looking for FB friends who agree science is a good thing comment below\u201d and we saw each other\u2019s Blue Merles basically). Five years on, she now has a grown dog and a puppy. Both breeds have similar enough energy and intelligence that I group them.\n\nMy last Sheltie did not want to be outside. Her doggy brain said her job was looking after me first and keeping an eye on my severely disabled (physically plus dementia) mom was the whole pack\u2019s job. If I was out she wanted to be with me but otherwise\u2026 she loved fetch and 20-30 minute sessions in the family room a few times a day was fine with her. When I dealt with 2020 by taking walks (I have a physical disability, less than Moms but I use a cane, but slow and steady worked) she wasn\u2019t thrilled but better she was there if I needed her (and I did have a bad fall once and she did the tasks that got me up). \n\nKeeping the Aussie from losing her mind that year was considerably harder for my friend\u2026\n\nMy childhood Sheltie was a sweet little thing with either no brain cells for learning tricks or enormous brain for weaponized incompetence (I am now 44 so that is lost to the sands of time). Didn\u2019t get into things. Only barked when Dad played a specific game to wind her up. \n\nThe puppy my friend has had a few months is too young to draw much from the stories. I know there are a few things that can test future personality with some success (put pup in room with new toy and human. If pup looks for ways to play with new toy and human and explore it together they will probably grow up into a dog that will happily help a human solve problems, whether it\u2019s navigating the human\u2019s disabled or looking for survivors) but still. He baby.", "She can give it back but the kid can\u2019t keep it in her house", "Well the house is her property and if she wants something out of her house it's her right.

She could\u2019ve handled this a million times better like, I don\u2019t know, having a rational conversation with her family instead of running off with the puppy. If she was vegan and bf\u2019s daughter wasn\u2019t, would she be in the right to force her into eating a new diet because she owns the fridge?\n\nETA: if bf got the husky from a breeder, contracts usually forbid the puppy from being rehomed. It would need to be returned to the breeder. So OP is TA for that in my eyes alone as well.\n\nETA 2: allergies aren\u2019t a concern here. I don\u2019t think OP really wants to share her home with BF and his daughter at the end of the day.", "I wish being a landlord meant I had that kind of power over my properties\u2026.But that\u2019s not how the law work.", "She gave her bf two days to sort something out. By the wording it sounds like he thought she'd blink first, but instead she carried through with rehoming the puppy to somewhere far more appropriate.", "The house doesn\u2019t belong to the bf or his daughter. She could have called animal control which would have had a worse outcome", "If a husky breeder gave a puppy to a person who had no idea what it takes to raise it and asked for no proof of home ownership then it\u2019s safe to assume it wasn\u2019t a reputable breeder and there\u2019s no contract."]}
