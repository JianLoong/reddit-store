The 13yo wanting to live with you is no reflection on how good/bad of a parent the mom is.", "So your ex has been raising this kid for 13 years. You have not even been in the country. Now you walk in when she is at the age where **every** teenager has conflict with their mother, and you tell her she is a terrible parent and you're going to do everything your own way from now on. You are supposed to be parenting **together**. Of course the kid wants to live with you, you've made it clear you're going to have zero boundaries. Put your ego aside and work with her mother to establish common ground. You're creating more problems than you are solving by walking in and thinking you know anything about how to handle a teenager. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re enjoying your daughter choosing you and using it as a weapon against your ex. That alone makes you the AH. \n\nSounds like you e barely been a parent for years. You have no idea what your ex has struggled with. Cut her some slack. And don\u2019t let your daughter manipulate you into being hateful and hurtful. Teenagers can be utterly selfish and brutal. Don\u2019t wait until she gets into trouble or is flunking out to start putting reasonable rules in place just because your ex is pushing for consistency with her rules.", "No, you\u2019re not a better parent. We don\u2019t have enough information to make that judgment. \n\nBut I can say is that you are winning the award for a \u201cweekend/holiday parent\u201d. The parent who doesn\u2019t say no. The parent who won\u2019t follow a routine \u2026 probably the kind of parent that gives dessert before dinner. And that\u2019s fine if it\u2019s the way you want to do things. But it\u2019s not doing your child any favors. \n\nIt\u2019s fun and new right now. The first time you have to put your foot down about something, and have to actually be a parent, the blow back is going to be potentially severe. \n\nYTA", "ESH. I was fully on your side on this one, until... \n\n>I told her that I'm a better parent than her obviously since she raised a kid who doesn't even want to see her more than twice a month\n\nBashing the other parent is not \"good parenting.\" You BOTH are her parents and should work as a team. That's what is best for your child. You need to stow your attitude and your ex needs to release some control. It doesn't make either of you better than the other.", ">I told her that I'm a better parent than her obviously since she raised a kid who doesn't even want to see her more than twice a month\n\nYTA for this...teen girls and their mothers fight, it's pretty common. You don't know the full story of what's going on between the two of them, and saying something like this is just trying to get under your ex's skin. You don't have to follow all her rules to the letter, BUT you do need to work together to do what is best for you daughter instead of working against each other and trying to \"WIN\" parenting.", "ESH\n\nI was on your side until I got to this part\n\n>. I told her that I'm a better parent than her obviously since she raised a kid who doesn't even want to see her more than twice a month\n\nYour ex does seem a little controlling, but ultimately we don\u2019t know the reasons why she set up these very specific rules.  It could come from a lot of trial and error and what actually works best for your daughter.\n\nBut she was right, you don\u2019t know what it takes to really be the parent, youve been absent most of your daughters life.", "YTA Spoken like a person who knows nothing about parenting. Your ex is giving structure to your daughters life. If you disagree with your ex then try to come to a mutual conclusion. Don't insult her parenting after you have done none of it for 13 years (like how do you not see how laughable that is?) And don't equate her wanting to live with you more as being a better parent. Of course the 13 year old who doesn't know better will pick the parent who is more lenient. That doesn't make that parent better or right. Being a parent is about setting your kids up for success. There are many ways of doing so. But perhaps your ex knows more about what is best for your daughter since she's spent 13 years raising her and you've been back for a few months. There is probably a middle ground here where your ex might be too strict. But you have to hear her reasoning and work together to do what is best for your daughter. Not act high and mighty because your daughter likes your lax living situation more.", "YTA\n\nYou're the Disney Dad so of course she wants to live with you and barely see her mother, you know the one who raised her while you were in another country. You get to be the fun parent while the mom whose been parenting for 13 years gets turned into the villain.", "You guys need to learn to co-parent for the sake of your child\n\nESH", "NTA\n\nBut... your child may be playing you. Yes, your ex may be to strict, but your child may have chosen you specifically because you are too lax. There isn't enough here to claim that you are the better parent. (Granted, it is very likely. Just make sure that you are actually parenting.)", "Nta. She shouldn\u2019t be dictating your parenting.\nTalk with your daughter. Sounds like your ex was very controlling and probably emotionally hurt your daughter. \n\n(Coming from someone who was raised by a single mom, everyone will call you an asshole because\u2026 the mom raised her. Just keep doing what\u2019s best for your daughter and no matter who you are a 5pm curfew is not right for most preteens)", "you're NTA for not doing what she wants, but you are TA for the way you're handling this whole situation.  i don't know why you expect your ex to just graciously hand your daughter over on a silver platter without any input.  you've been absent for your daughter's whole entire life, then you walk in with an attitude bigger than texas and insist you know what's best.  by doing this you're basically telling your ex that everything she's done all this time is wrong and/or none of it matters.  or at least you aren't respecting her input, she isn't feeling seen or heard by you at all.  and you seem to see it as a competition rather than a team effort.  i know what it's like to try to coparent with someone like you and it's more stressful than being a single parent.  you could try to make it easier on all 3 of you and make it a team effort.  you will all benefit from it, especially your daughter.", "NTA \n\nBut i think that there's some lack of maturity here, it's not a competition about who raises her better, you guys need to have a serious conversation and learn on how to co-parent instead of making the kid picking sides and end up messing up her mental health", "NTA.  Your house, your rules, and if either you or your ex wants to impose rules in the other house you need mutual agreement.\n\nThe \"no idea what it's like to be a parent\" comment is pretty strange given that you now have majority custody.", "NTA. Consistency is important but by age thirteen, I would guess that your daughter is able to understand and adjust to different expectations in different settings. As long as your daughter is meeting the goal (getting homework completed each day, not getting into trouble after school) then everything is good. Your ex is having a hard time loosening her grip.", "NTA\n\nYou spelled it out exactly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
