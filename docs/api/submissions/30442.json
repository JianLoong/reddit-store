Thanks for the messages but I will not be doing that. Two, I do love and care about my girlfriend. Her doctor told her to eat a regular diet because the tests they did to check for gluten issues came back negative. I am just following what her doctor says. Three, Matt is a happily monogamous man with a wife. He is not trying to sleep with my girlfriend. Please stop saying that she's cheating on me with him. He's just a nice person.\n\nEDIT - I am not a doctor and I have never questioned a doctor before. This post is showing me that doctors can apparently be extremely wrong. I have apologized to my girlfriend and explained my side of things. I now see that she wasn't in denial, just skeptical about whether or not they know what they're doing. I'm looking into resources to get her better testing and a doctor that hopefully knows how to help her autoimmune disorder better than this one. I'm not writing her off on purpose, I'm just kind of stupid and don't question things as much as I probably should.\n\n\n\nI (25m) have been dating my girlfriend, Sam (25f), for the past 8 months. Sam has been gluten free for the past three years due to health concerns and recently convinced her doctor to test her for celiac disease. She does not have celiac disease, as evidenced by her blood test results. \n\nMy friends and I all get together every year for a holiday party where my best friend, Matt (27m), usually hosts and cooks a bunch of food. (Think Christmas/Hannuka/Thanksgiving all in one) This year we're including Sam, who has notified everyone that she can't have anything made with flour, despite her tests saying that she is fine. Matt said he'd look into gluten free recipes for her. I am uncomfortable with this because she can eat flour, she just doesn't want to and I don't see why my friends should have to back up that choice. I explained this to Matt and he told me that he wanted to make her feel welcome and doesn't \"want to challenge anybody about this\", despite her lying about having a health issue.\n\nI spoke to Sam yesterday about the situation and she told me I am being unsupportive of her health issues. I said that it isn't a health issue and she told me it is. I brought up how she was tested and the tests were negative for celiac disease so it clearly isn't a health issue. She hasnt talked to me much since as she is \"thinking about stuff\". Tried talking to Matt about the argument this morning and he told me I messed up.

If she hasn\u2019t been eating any gluten the blood tests are not going to be accurate. Also, some people have gluten issues that aren\u2019t celiac. Jumping to her lying about having a dietary restriction is incredibly obnoxious. YTA, you don\u2019t get to police her food choices.", "YTA. She may not have celiac disease, but she may very well still have a bad reaction to eating it. A blood test for celiac ONLY tests for celiac disease, not for gluten intolerances. Your friend Matt seems to have no problem at all accommodating her and is being very welcoming to her, and still you went behind her back, telling him that your girlfriend is *lying* to him. What did you think to gain from this, really? Why not let Matt make her feel welcome and support your girlfriend when she tells you it's an issue for her? How does it affect you negatively to do that? You absolutely did mess up.", ">This year we're including Sam, who has notified everyone that she can't have anything made with flour, despite her tests saying that she is fine\n\nSince when did her tests say she was fine eating flour? Her tests said, according to you, that she doesn't have celiac, but that doesn't mean gluten/wheat products don't cause her problems. \n\n> I am uncomfortable with this because she can eat flour, she just doesn't want to\n\nNope, wrong. Incorrect. You're conflating a lack of celiac with being able to eat flour. That's not a reasonable assumption to make. You can simply have an allergic reaction to wheat or gluten without being celiac. Or you can have an intolerance to wheat or gluten, also without being celiac (or allergic!)\n\nYTA\n\n>She hasnt talked to me much since as she is \"thinking about stuff\"\n\nI'd be thinking about dumping you.", "YTA. \n\nCome on, really? It took me about 10 seconds of research to find an entire cited Wikipedia article explaining \"Gluten related disorders\" that AREN'T Celiac's. You're not a doctor. Your arrogance in deciding that she's faking because \"she can eat flour, she just doesn't want to\" is a pretty big red flag. It's dismissive of her lived experiences. It can also be \"medical gaslighting\" where someone attempts to convince someone else that no, they're not actually sick, they're faking and they're fine. It's a big AH move and chronic sufferers know it well. \n\nPeople with chronic illness often have \"normal\" test results. That doesn't mean there isn't a problem. That just means whatever they're testing for isn't what's causing the problem. There's still more testing to go through. This process is frustrating, slow, and demoralizing. Any relationship with a chronically ill person needs to be a supportive one. \"Thinking about stuff\" is likely her deciding whether or not this relationship is worth continuing because of your attitude and unsupportive behavior.", "YTA.

I had multiple blood tests that came back negative for it, mostly because even before diagnosis I was heavily avoiding gluten. Your girlfriend would have to be eating at least 6 slices of bread every day for six weeks for the blood test to show she has Coeliac if she has been off gluten for that long. I eventually had to see a specialist and have numerous extremely invasive scopes before getting a diagnosis.

However, most of the tests are inaccurate if the patient has been avoiding gluten just like your girlfriend has. The test could have been a false negative. Also, having celiac is awful. You can't enjoy many of the foods most people do. Sometimes, you go out to eat and just watch everyone else eat. No one would choose it. So instead of being sensitive to that, you decided to be an asshole about it because it's an inconvenience for you.", "YTA.  The blood test for celiac often produces false negatives.  The only way to really know is to have a biopsy done.", "YTA - You don't make it clear what the health issues are.

First she didn\u2019t tell your friend she had celiac disease, she said she can\u2019t eat gluten for medical reasons. She knows her body not you, she knows how she feels when she eats certain foods, an intolerance to gluten is still a possibility without a diagnosis of celiac disease, and that would be a medical condition. Hell, even if it is simply all in her head like you seem to be suggesting, then that speaks to some mental health issues when it comes to her diet, which is also a medical reason for her not being able to eat gluten. \n\nYour girlfriend told everyone she can\u2019t eat gluten, she didn\u2019t demand the menu be gluten free, or they make special dishes for her, but she needs to know what she will be able to eat before so she can prepare based on the menu if she will need to bring her own food, or eat before hand. \n\nThe main reason YTA is bc you are outraged on behalf of someone else, who themselves have stated they have no issues with making some minor adjustments to a dinner party to make sure a guest feels welcome in their home.

Matt said he'd look into gluten free recipes for her. I am uncomfortable with this because she can eat flour, she just doesn't want to and I don't see why my friends should have to back up that choice. I explained this to Matt and he told me that he wanted to make her feel welcome and doesn't \"want to challenge anybody about this\", despite her lying about having a health issue.\n\nI spoke to Sam yesterday about the situation and she told me I am being unsupportive of her health issues. I said that it isn't a health issue and she told me it is. I brought up how she was tested and the tests were negative for celiac disease so it clearly isn't a health issue.

But the way you're pinning this as an argument about you being right and her being wrong about a health issue makes you TA.\n\nThat being said, your GF shouldn't expect anyone to adjust the cooking to her *preferences*, and it's completely appropriate to highlight that these are preferences and not health issues if she plays that card in an argument.

It's not just one thing, they look for more things in her blood, bowel system etc. However there is a disease called non coealic disease. \n\nBut many people feel uncomfortable after eating things with gluten because their microbiom balance is off (due to their poor diet).

Coeliac disease is very serious and gluten can contaminate gluten free foods as well.

If she\u2019s been gluten free for years the test won\u2019t be reliable. I have a friend having to continue to eat gluten rn until they can schedule her for a test, even though there\u2019s a very good chance it\u2019s what\u2019s making her sick. Gf needs a better doctor and op is yta.", "The blood test didn\u2019t confirm irt, but it\u2019s also not the gold standard either. \n\nShe can\u2019t tolerate gluten, YTA.", "Her doctor ruled out gluten as an issue. She doesn't have a wheat sensitivity or celiac disease. She was also tested for thyroid issues which could show issues with gluten and those came back negative as well.", "She had some issues with chronic pain that got a bit worse but other than that nothing that I know of? She was staying with me that week and seemed a little cranky but the pain was manageable with an electric blanket so nothing too bad.", "> a sensitivity to the common pesticides used in wheat crops here\n\nI have also heard this hypothesis, and it makes a lot of sense. The increase in apparent gluten/wheat sensitivities correlates closely with the increase in pesticide use on industrially cultivated crops.", "And there are a lot of people who are just full of sh*t. My cousin\u2019s wife drinks beer and eats wheat bread while telling us all she has celiac.", "I've been doing research in a lab on neonicotinoids and there effects on different cells and it seems plausible.", "The blood work is decent, endoscopy is more conclusive, genetic testing can rule it out but can't give a positive. For both endoscopy and blood you should be eating gluten for multiple weeks beforehand.", "Gluten free cake is something you grow to accept \ud83d\ude06 if you love cake. Thankfully, I do not.\n\nWhat I do love is gluten-free, dairy free, NON vegan food, which is impossible to find out in the world of restaurants unless you pay extra to combine a vegan dish and meat dish.", "Oh, but you do? YTA why would you be such a dick to your (now ex) girlfriend.", "3 days is definitely not enough to get accurate test results. Small intestine biopsy is required for a definite diagnosis in my country and would require her to see a specialist, yes, but I don't know how it works wherever you're from.\n\nETA: Although it works differently in different places, I feel very certain her GP will not be able to perform her biopsy, so yes, she will have to see a specialist for the actual biopsy. However, some places also may require her to consult with a gastroenterologist beforehand, other places her GP may be able to refer her directly to a biopsy.", "So you admit that when she had gluten she had negative effects but you wanted to keep doing it anyways, do you even care about her?", "I\u2019m not a dr but I was pretty sure it was at least six weeks you needed to be eating gluten for before a test, a quick google search (which obviously is not a substitute for a dr) also says six week\u2019s minimum for coeliac testing to be valid.\nFor me my GP ran a GI blood panel which flagged coeliac markers and I was then referred to gastroenterology for an endoscopy which is when they took biopsies. I\u2019m probably not in the same country as you (you spell coeliac the American way so I\u2019m assuming) so idk how it works for you guys, if she can go see a GI specialist I think she probably should. I don\u2019t know if she has coeliac, she may not do, but I don\u2019t think the negative test was valid", "You don\u2019t need a doctor to tell you if you have a chronic illness and something makes you feel worse to avoid it.", "Medical professionals have a tendency to ignore women\u2019s problems, even if the woman is in crippling pain and begging for help. \n\nSometimes they don\u2019t know best. Sometimes the test results are wrong. And sometimes boyfriends decide their girlfriends don\u2019t know how to manage their own damn bodies and talk over them, spreading misinformation to other people because they decided they knew best.", "Dr do not have any nutrition knowledge at all. They don't even do 4 hours on it. So him telling her she can eat the regular sad diet is just bullshit. She knows her body. Yet the Dr are not listening to her and you are not listening to her. This is the problem so many women have with Dr is we are not listened to at all and why it can take up to 10 year to get diagnosed with something. And if the Dr did a standard thyroid test nothing would show up. He needed to do a indepth test to show up anything. Be supportive not a jerk", "Maybe also listen to your girlfriend. She knows her body and what she's feeling. Autoimmune diseases can be incredibly difficult to work around. Doctors aren't always 100% right. YTA", "Gluten free is recommended as part of an anti-inflammatory diet which helps with chronic pain and is recommended by doctors. Sorry to say, bud, but gf is right on this one", "There are actually recent studies saying that gluten free diets are beneficial for patients with autoimmune disorders, even if they aren't diagnosed with celiac.", "I\u2019ve been tested for celiac three times and they were all negative, plus a colonoscopy. I still have issues digesting it and am on a gluten free diet, directed by my doctor, and it\u2019s the only time I\u2019m pain free. The tests are not conclusive for celiac or gluten sensitivity.", "YTA, you messed up. My wife isn't diagnosed with celiac's, but gluten messes her up. She she also has an autoimmune disorder, and when she tried eliminating gluten, suddenly her stomach wasn't always bothering her. Time to admit your f-up and ask for forgiveness, if you still have a chance.", "gluten causes inflammation, so cutting out gluten for someone with a chronic pain issue is actually a good idea. i have fibromyalgia and my symptoms vastly improve when i don\u2019t eat gluten. however, i do not have celiacs or any allergies. that doesn\u2019t mean i can eat gluten without consequence", "You keep referring to these tests despite multiple people telling you including me now as someone whose mom has celiac if she was not eating gluten at the time of the test the tests are going to be negative no matter what.\n\nshe could have Celiac or gluten intolerance and it won't show up because her body has not had gluten!", "Yeah that's not possible to test or rule out. I'm guessing just a regular doctor not a gastroenterologist.\n\nShe may not be celiac or allergic but that can still be a significant intolerance.", "Does she feel sick, ill or bad after having wheat products? What was the root of her looking into food allergies?", "If she took the $10 copay thyroid test it\u2019s not going to show a lot. She may need to go to endocrinologist and get the good and test and find out if she has Hashimoto\u2019s which is an auto immune disease.", "Like chronic stomach pain? Tbh she might have something like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that some certain things flair up. Even if she's not celiac, she might be gluten intolerant or it might just be triggering to her digestive system. For example, I have IBS and I cant eat some specific foods, like mushrooms, bananas, melon, pineapple, or coconut without severe cramping and an unpleasant time on the toilet. Is there a reason that you're not believing her about her experience, and that you aren't feeling like it's reasonable for her to get some accommodations for her diet?", "A Celiac test will give a false negative if no gluten is introduced to the system to make it have an immune response so quit trying to use these tests that her doctor did inappropriately as proof. 3 days is not nearly long enough", "You do know wheat causes inflammation so it would cause her to have pain. Especially if she has arthritis. You telling her to manage pain with a heated blanket then just not eat certain food make you a total jerk and TA here. Maybe read a book or google inflammation from wheat.", "I know you edited to say now you understand and all that but I feel the need to point out how dismissive and rude you\u2019re being here. She was in pain. She was in a worse pain than usual, and here you are like: yeah, nothing too bad! \n\nNothing too bad is NOT BEING IN ANY PAIN. \n\nShe was in pain. She told you she was in pain, but since she\u2026 what, she\u2019s used to manage her pain you feel comfortable dismissing her suffering. Dude, you need a crash course of decency. Try to understand why the fuck it\u2019s so easy for you to dismiss your gf\u2019s pain, and to be more worried about someone making one more dish than YOUR GIRLFRIEND BEING IN PAIN.", "And they cause so many problems for those of us that genuinely can't eat or drink anything with gluten in.", "Yeah either that\u2019s BS or she\u2019s poisoning herself (not all celiacs have many symptoms, but all get damaged guts). The fad dieters I do find pretty annoying and make folks take real issues less seriously, but on the plus side they\u2019ve created more demand for GF products and labelling.", "She could be asymptomatic celiac. Even with no immediate side-effects, she would definitely still be doing damage to her small intestines and increasing her risk of certain cancers, developing other auto-immune disorders, and generally shortening her lifespan.", "Thank you! We're from the US. I'll try to look for the right doctors to help her get proper testing.", "Yup, this is how it is for my wife. She may not have celiac's disease, but keeping gluten out of her diet helps and it's noticeable when she consumes it by mistake.", "Same. Every time i swear this will be the positive test, just bc I\u2019d like to have a definitive answer to why gluten wrecks me, but nope! \n\nYTA for sure.", "She does have an autoimmune disease called rhumatoid arthritis but not the thyroid issues. I don't know what test it was exactly but it definitely wasn't $10.", "No, she just has general chronic pain. We know the main issue is an autoimmune disorder. (Arthritis)\n\nI am just trying to keep her from ignoring what her doctors are saying. The comments are making me wonder if her doctors actually know what they're doing, though. This is the second one she's been to and I don't want to encourage her to go through the process of finding another one again but it's sounding like she might have to.", "I did not tell her to do that and I wasn't trying to dismiss her pain. I'm just repeating what she told me?", "Exactly. Same problem exists with food allergies.", "Her friend, a chiropractor\u2019, diagnosed the entire family via email from 800 miles away.  Cousin mysteriously \u201crecovered\u201d a year later. And both kids very suddenly \u201coutgrew\u201d it in their mid teens.  \n\nNever underestimate how many people self diagnose things and are completely wrong.", "No problem! I'm glad you're looking into it - sounds like you've taken a lot of our comments to heart :)", "My family has tons of autoimmune diseases. Mom is the only one with celiac but my dads side has ulcerative colitis (him and all four of his siblings) and two of them can\u2019t have gluten due to that. It makes my UCTD worse as well so I avoid. Other family members have seen benefits to their autoimmune diseases by cutting back on gluten (To give a full picture- my maternal grandpa had celiac, my paternal cousin had Stills, a maternal cousin had autoimmune encephalitis, and another paternal cousin and an aunt have hashimotos).", "Doctors do generally suck for women lol, especially for women with stomach issues or other chronic conditions. But I think what's most important is that you show her YOUR support and to not belittle what she's going through or not believe her symptoms. It might be helpful for her to see a naturopath since they're usually quite good at helping you get in touch with your body. I hope she figures out everything :)", "First result when googling \"celiac disease joint pain\" gives me this:   \n\n[The Connection Between Gluten and Arthritis](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/anti-inflammatory/the-connection-between-gluten-and-arthritis)\n\nETA: also, there's this:   \n[Celiac Disease Masquerading as Arthralgia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9237855/)\n\nMight want to start taking your GF a bit more serious...", "Fun fact: celiac disease can cause chronic pain, joint pain, brain fog, anxiety, depression etc. it\u2019s a full body disease, not just stomach distress.
