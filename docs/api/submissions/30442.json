Thanks for the messages but I will not be doing that. Two, I do love and care about my girlfriend. Her doctor told her to eat a regular diet because the tests they did to check for gluten issues came back negative. I am just following what her doctor says. Three, Matt is a happily monogamous man with a wife. He is not trying to sleep with my girlfriend. Please stop saying that she's cheating on me with him. He's just a nice person.\n\nEDIT - I am not a doctor and I have never questioned a doctor before. This post is showing me that doctors can apparently be extremely wrong. I have apologized to my girlfriend and explained my side of things. I now see that she wasn't in denial, just skeptical about whether or not they know what they're doing. I'm looking into resources to get her better testing and a doctor that hopefully knows how to help her autoimmune disorder better than this one. I'm not writing her off on purpose, I'm just kind of stupid and don't question things as much as I probably should.\n\n\n\nI (25m) have been dating my girlfriend, Sam (25f), for the past 8 months. Sam has been gluten free for the past three years due to health concerns and recently convinced her doctor to test her for celiac disease. She does not have celiac disease, as evidenced by her blood test results. \n\nMy friends and I all get together every year for a holiday party where my best friend, Matt (27m), usually hosts and cooks a bunch of food. (Think Christmas/Hannuka/Thanksgiving all in one) This year we're including Sam, who has notified everyone that she can't have anything made with flour, despite her tests saying that she is fine. Matt said he'd look into gluten free recipes for her. I am uncomfortable with this because she can eat flour, she just doesn't want to and I don't see why my friends should have to back up that choice. I explained this to Matt and he told me that he wanted to make her feel welcome and doesn't \"want to challenge anybody about this\", despite her lying about having a health issue.\n\nI spoke to Sam yesterday about the situation and she told me I am being unsupportive of her health issues. I said that it isn't a health issue and she told me it is. I brought up how she was tested and the tests were negative for celiac disease so it clearly isn't a health issue. She hasnt talked to me much since as she is \"thinking about stuff\". Tried talking to Matt about the argument this morning and he told me I messed up.

If she hasn\u2019t been eating any gluten the blood tests are not going to be accurate. Also, some people have gluten issues that aren\u2019t celiac. Jumping to her lying about having a dietary restriction is incredibly obnoxious. YTA, you don\u2019t get to police her food choices.", "YTA. She may not have celiac disease, but she may very well still have a bad reaction to eating it. A blood test for celiac ONLY tests for celiac disease, not for gluten intolerances. Your friend Matt seems to have no problem at all accommodating her and is being very welcoming to her, and still you went behind her back, telling him that your girlfriend is *lying* to him. What did you think to gain from this, really? Why not let Matt make her feel welcome and support your girlfriend when she tells you it's an issue for her? How does it affect you negatively to do that? You absolutely did mess up.", ">This year we're including Sam, who has notified everyone that she can't have anything made with flour, despite her tests saying that she is fine\n\nSince when did her tests say she was fine eating flour? Her tests said, according to you, that she doesn't have celiac, but that doesn't mean gluten/wheat products don't cause her problems. \n\n> I am uncomfortable with this because she can eat flour, she just doesn't want to\n\nNope, wrong. Incorrect. You're conflating a lack of celiac with being able to eat flour. That's not a reasonable assumption to make. You can simply have an allergic reaction to wheat or gluten without being celiac. Or you can have an intolerance to wheat or gluten, also without being celiac (or allergic!)\n\nYTA\n\n>She hasnt talked to me much since as she is \"thinking about stuff\"\n\nI'd be thinking about dumping you.", "YTA. \n\nCome on, really? It took me about 10 seconds of research to find an entire cited Wikipedia article explaining \"Gluten related disorders\" that AREN'T Celiac's. You're not a doctor. Your arrogance in deciding that she's faking because \"she can eat flour, she just doesn't want to\" is a pretty big red flag. It's dismissive of her lived experiences. It can also be \"medical gaslighting\" where someone attempts to convince someone else that no, they're not actually sick, they're faking and they're fine. It's a big AH move and chronic sufferers know it well. \n\nPeople with chronic illness often have \"normal\" test results. That doesn't mean there isn't a problem. That just means whatever they're testing for isn't what's causing the problem. There's still more testing to go through. This process is frustrating, slow, and demoralizing. Any relationship with a chronically ill person needs to be a supportive one. \"Thinking about stuff\" is likely her deciding whether or not this relationship is worth continuing because of your attitude and unsupportive behavior.", "YTA. There is not one single test for celiac disease. Diagnosis is complicated and can take multiple tests with multiple specialists. Besides which, you can be intolerant to gluten without having celiac.

I had multiple blood tests that came back negative for it, mostly because even before diagnosis I was heavily avoiding gluten. Your girlfriend would have to be eating at least 6 slices of bread every day for six weeks for the blood test to show she has Coeliac if she has been off gluten for that long. I eventually had to see a specialist and have numerous extremely invasive scopes before getting a diagnosis. It's difficult enough to live with something like this without people close to you questioning whether it's real or not. If you actually like your gf then do better.", "YTA.

However, most of the tests are inaccurate if the patient has been avoiding gluten just like your girlfriend has. The test could have been a false negative. Also, having celiac is awful. You can't enjoy many of the foods most people do. Sometimes, you go out to eat and just watch everyone else eat. No one would choose it. So instead of being sensitive to that, you decided to be an asshole about it because it's an inconvenience for you.", "YTA.  The blood test for celiac often produces false negatives.  The only way to really know is to have a biopsy done.", "YTA - You don't make it clear what the health issues are.

First she didn\u2019t tell your friend she had celiac disease, she said she can\u2019t eat gluten for medical reasons. She knows her body not you, she knows how she feels when she eats certain foods, an intolerance to gluten is still a possibility without a diagnosis of celiac disease, and that would be a medical condition. Hell, even if it is simply all in her head like you seem to be suggesting, then that speaks to some mental health issues when it comes to her diet, which is also a medical reason for her not being able to eat gluten. \n\nYour girlfriend told everyone she can\u2019t eat gluten, she didn\u2019t demand the menu be gluten free, or they make special dishes for her, but she needs to know what she will be able to eat before so she can prepare based on the menu if she will need to bring her own food, or eat before hand. \n\nThe main reason YTA is bc you are outraged on behalf of someone else, who themselves have stated they have no issues with making some minor adjustments to a dinner party to make sure a guest feels welcome in their home.

Matt said he'd look into gluten free recipes for her.

I explained this to Matt and he told me that he wanted to make her feel welcome and doesn't \"want to challenge anybody about this\", despite her lying about having a health issue.\n\nI spoke to Sam yesterday about the situation and she told me I am being unsupportive of her health issues. I said that it isn't a health issue and she told me it is. I brought up how she was tested and the tests were negative for celiac disease so it clearly isn't a health issue.

Aren\u2019t how it\u2019s primarily diagnosed (my sister had a stomach biopsy for her diagnosis, and it involved eating heavy gluten for weeks beforehand) and 2. Its not detectable if you haven\u2019t recently eaten gluten. Which she hasn\u2019t. She genuinely might still be celiac. \n\nYou\u2019re being so incredibly, unnecessarily insensitive, rude and downright dumb. I cannot fathom why you\u2019d care, at all, or try to intervene in her comfort and well-being like this. There\u2019s no hindrance to having a gluten free option at all. YTA 100%.", "YTA x 1,000 - it\u2019s literally none of your business if she wants to go gluten free for health reasons. You can get a stomach ache from eating too much of it, even without Celiac.

However, if that's the case, that's her personal choice, and she shouldn't be using an inaccurate diagnosis.  If this is the case, it's fine for her to eat how she wants and take precautions by herself.  However, requesting that the meal be gluten-free to accommodate her \"health issue\" is kind of high maintenance.  There will likely be lots of things there (like meat and lots of vegetables) that don't have flour or other gluten-containing proteins.  Otherwise, she could offer to bring a dish to pass.  \nI don't think you're the AH.", "Kinda TA.\n\nYou're the asshole for how you're approaching the topic, and your GF is an AH for how she is putting the burden of her food preferences on everyone else. \n\nIf you had just talked to her about how she was being unreasonable to expect everyone to modify their foods for a preference, which has been cleared by a doctor as a preference rather than a medical exemption/sensitivity, you're NTA. But the way you're pinning this as an argument about you being right and her being wrong about a health issue makes you TA.\n\nThat being said, your GF shouldn't expect anyone to adjust the cooking to her *preferences*, and it's completely appropriate to highlight that these are preferences and not health issues if she plays that card in an argument. This should really be an argument of your GF making GF food to bring rather than making everyone cater to her.", "YTA, some people just don\u2019t handle gluten very well and even though they technically can eat it they\u2019d rather not because it can cause digestion issues. celiacs disease is the most extreme form of gluten intolerance. you can still struggle with gluten without having full on celiacs.", "If she was really good with her gluten free diet the test will come back negative. She has to eat gluten again for weeks in order for the test to be accurate. \n\nIn my country there is a strict protocol which tells doctor what exams they need to perform to say someone has coeliac disease. It's not just one thing, they look for more things in her blood, bowel system etc. However there is a disease called non coealic disease. \n\nBut many people feel uncomfortable after eating things with gluten because their microbiom balance is off (due to their poor diet). It can be cured with a healthy diet. \n\nWith all these I don't think it's a good idea for your friend to cook in his home for Your girlfriend. Coeliac disease is very serious and gluten can contaminate gluten free foods as well. With using the same kitchen equipment for the normal and the gluten free foods can lead to health problems and symptoms for your girlfriend. It's really hard to avoid contamination.

In my country you\u2019re placed on an incredibly high gluten diet for 3 (!!!) months to make sure something shows up in the blood works. And like others have mentioned, there\u2019s more than just celiac that gives you a bad reaction to gluten anyways!! \nYou\u2019ve not only embarrassed your gf to your friend, but you\u2019re incredibly unsupportive.

Only reason I was diagnosed was because I walked into my GP surgery to get a prescription for the pharmacy and my GP walked out his room to get someone from the waiting room and as he walked past me he said  \u201cyou look very pale, book yourself in for a blood test\u201d and walked off. Low and behold 6 months later I got my results back from my biopsy confirming I have coeliac disease and about a week after I stopped eating gluten, my memory improved, nothing felt hazy and I felt amazing.", "I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 20 years ago.

It'd still be nice to know for absolutely sure whether it's coeliac or not, though.

However, when I eat keto (which by default is mainly gluten-free) I'm not sick every day. I spike to a guy at work whose wife is the same way, and has been tested for so many things.

But I was miserable, feeling tired and bloated all the time. Decided to start eating meat again to see if it helped (it was when Atkins and Keto first started becoming popular). \n\nTo break my vegetarianism, my husband (also vegetarian) and I went to a BBQ restaurant and ordered the works - brisket, ribs, sausages, all the fixings. As soon as the first meat crossed my lips I couldn\u2019t stop, and I ate enough meat in one sitting to feed a family of six! \n\nAnd you know what happened? I felt fantastic! I too believed the stories that \u201cmeat will make a vegetarian sick\u201d and was prepared for some gastrointestinal consequences. But nothing happened. In fact I had more energy than I\u2019d had in years and my gut worked so much better (no more bloating and constipation). Now I eat meat regularly, about half our meals contain small amounts of meat, and I have lost weight and gained muscle without altering my exercise regimen. \n\nIf you are otherwise healthy, eating meat after even decades of being vegetarian is not automatically going to make a person sick.

It\u2019s been like 8? years since my older sister had a colonoscopy and they removed precancerous polyps, and they told her that any sibling should have a colonoscopy asap as a preventative measure, and it would be great to know what shape my intestines are in or if I could have a different illness that affects the intestines.\nI hope you can find answers for your health\u2763\ufe0f", "Depends where you live.

You may also be lactose intolerant if you haven\u2019t had any kind of dairy (recently or ever). \n\n\nIf you are allergic and not just tummy-ache intolerant, I absolutely do not recommend that you just go try it, but it\u2019s worth chatting with your allergist.", "Maybe.

Apparently there are around 7 different types we use for milk production. \n\nSo, what I discovered was the Jersey cow along with Guernsey, normande and brown swiss breeds have a higher percentage of A2 genes compared to the holstein. \n\nSo apparently cows with the A2 gene only produce A2 milk which only contains the A2 varient of the beta-casein protein.\n\n\nSo this may be why you prefer Jersry cow milk? Maybe \ud83e\udd14 another thing is it could be regional, as in it depends what they are fed. I know grass fed cows taste better than grain fed cows.

My mom was lactose intolerant so she mostly avoided dairy but could tolerate a small amount or sometimes would decide to just put up with the stomach upset, and she educated a lot of people about the difference between lactose intolerance and a milk allergy as a result because they\u2019d get confused.

She whined and moaned about all the things she couldn't have.  In addition to her alleged egg allergy,  she couldn't have any sugar or carbs whatsoever because she's such a severe diabetic,  nothing with any kind of fat because her cholesterol is so high,  etc. So I went online and researched how to make some of her favorite dishes in low carb and lowfat versions for her visit. I jumped through every hoop she held before me. But then after all that,  the next day she was bored with my cooking and wanted to go out to eat.  And had fried fish with mac and cheese,  several pieces of bread and butter, and of course pie for dessert! So obviously it was all about her getting narcissistic supply from putting me to all that trouble. \n\nBut as for OP and his lady, I agree with the YTA diagnosis for him. This girl has legitimate health issues and it's wrong for him to just assume she's doing it for attention like my ex-friend."]}
