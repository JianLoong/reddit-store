My girlfriend gave birth via an emergency C section after initially being induced and an infection occurring somewhere during the labour process. \n\nFast forward 3 weeks and mum and baby are healthy, and we are extremely happy in our little newborn bubble. I have done everything I can to make my partners recovery as seamless as possible, this includes taking the evening shift 10-1/2 to occupy my baby whilst mum sleeps, ready for the disjointed sleep she gets between 2 and 7/8am.  The baby is very well behaved and operates in a 3hour cycle of feed/sleep/feed and very rarely cries or is disgruntled(I'm quite surprised at how relaxed she is tbh).\n\nI have been on paternity leave for two weeks(1 used while being induced/the other for initial newborn time), and have returned to WFH for 3 days across the last 2 weeks so am still present in the house. Now the issue has arisen that I enjoy bouldering once a week on a Wednesday from 8-10 and am home for 1030.i have done this twice in the last couple of weeks and chose to go for a half hour run this evening because work has been full on and I needed to destress. All in all I have probably been out the house for exercise for around 6 hours in two weeks. \n\nMy partner has taken great offense at my decision to do this because its meant that she has missed out on a couple of hours of uninterrupted sleep because I haven't been here to occupy our baby downstairs. This has resulted in her calling me selfish, distant and uninterested for which I honestly believe I have not been because Ive done nothing but wait hand and foot on her to ensure that she is in the best place physically and mentally. \n\nWe have kinda argued about this situation and in the moment I said I need the break in our current routine to exercise to ensure I don't go Insane (I'm not going insane, I'm very much enjoying the newborn bubble but it's a figure of speech I used and its been taken literally) \n\nSo question is, AITA for wanting to exercise whilst my GF is at home with a (very chilled) newborn.", "created_utc": 1684448785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lcw8g/aita_m28_for_exercising_sporadically_with_a/", "score": 1203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And the only time you can find time for yourself is during that 4 hour window when she needs to sleep?", "YTA\n\nOn average it takes at least six  to eight weeks to recover from a c-section. Your partner was basically fileted so she could give birth to your baby. You're on maternity leave, not have fun and abandon your injured girlfriend leave.\n\nEdit: appears OP already deleted their comments so I'll add it here:\n\nLukeeeHU4L: I've left the house on my days Im working and have the luxury of WFH so what if I had to go into the office and was out the hours for 8-9 hours a day.\n\nAnd my response to that is:\n\nThen you'd file for FMLA to stay home with your girlfriend to care for her, the home and the baby.\n\nWhen my sister got a c-section with her twins I lived at her home for three months, I was able to do that because I filed for FMLA, it was approved until she got her restrictions lifted from her doctor.\n\nThe only time I left was when it was necessary otherwise I didn't leave the house.", "YTA, and not for needing some \"you\" time after having a newborn. You're the AH here for refusing to adjust your schedule to ensure that your GF, who just went through traumatic surgery and is still recovering from a serious infection AND by your own admission is getting 3 hours of sleep a night, is well taken care of before you go anywhere. It's fine to need some time to exercise/relax/scream into a pillow/sit somewhere quiet, as long as you work with your GF to make sure 1. You going somewhere won't interrupt her schedule and 2. She gets some time away too.", "Initially I would have said no and just suggest you find a different workout time that works for you both. But it\u2019s the last part that makes me say YTA. You don\u2019t get to get to say that spending time with her and the child is making you go insane and then claim she is taking out of context. If you don\u2019t mean it, don\u2019t say it. And have you considered once that maybe she also needs some time to herself as well?", "I'm going with YTA.  Your partner just had major abdominal surgery that resulted in bringing a baby into the world. .  It takes at least six weeks to completely recover from the surgery, (and at least 18 years to recover from the baby).     I think you could manage to stay home until she has healed.  She has to.", "I f_cking love bouldering. But I could go a couple of weeks without it if I needed to help my partner recover from literal surgery - with my newborn in the house. I understand you need to take your mind off things sometimes, but so does your gf. You need to find other ways to relieve stress at home, or by going for a 10 minute walk around the block. You and your gf need to talk to each other and come up with ways for her to do the same. You need to be 100% supportive and reliable for your gf and your child, at least for the next 3-6 weeks. YTA", "INFO: You pretty much only talk about who\u2019s doing what at night. How are you splitting responsibilities during the day? Why do you get more uninterrupted sleep time than she does? When does your wife get a break, besides to sleep?", "Yta your partner had invasive surgery, birthed a child, and fought off a life threatening infection and you want her to be able to be on her own with no support after 18 days? Why would you treat anyone that way, let alone someone you love? Would you want to be treated the way you have been acting,  truly?", "YTA- unless you are giving HER 6 hours of fun time, you need to stop this.  One day a week being out for an hour or two would be ok but you are expecting life to be the same as before.  sorry bud, that wont be happening for a long time.", "YTA because you can work out at home. Want to run? Run around your house and keep your phone on so that she can call you and tell you to come in so she can sleep. Heck, you could even run inside with your daughter sitting in front of you.   \n\n\nJust keep telling yourself, when you think you need a break, that she gets no breaks and just had major surgery. MAJOR surgery. If your choice of destressing techniques increases her stress, stop.", "YTA. 3 weeks is nothing for a C-section recovery. Your stressed and overwhelmed, but so is your wife PLUS the physical pain. Sorry, it\u2019s not acceptable to leave for a few hour stretches. \n\n30 min I can understand, but not 2-3 hrs. You\u2019re far away, god forbid there is an emergency your wife has no help. \n\nI was a few weeks postpartum after C-section and my husband had to help me out of bed/get dressed/stand/lift things, etc. yeah I\u2019d be pissed too if he said he needed a break and left us for a few hours. When does your wife get a break? \n\nWorking from home does not mean equal childcare responsibility.", "YTA. Do you want a cookie for parenting from 10PM-1AM?? No. Stay home. Do more. Bouldering can wait. Jesus.", "YTA\n\nFor the moment, exercise at home.", "YTA. Are you joking with this? You have a NEWBORN. And Mom had to miss out on sleep for this????", "A way forward would be to delay your personal activity time until the 3 month mark after she's well AND has had her turn at some individual time, too.  In this case, she's explicitly stated her strong need for sleep. Emotionally, at this point, you are probably the only person she trusts with baby. Having you there means her quality of sleep would be better.\n\nThis is because your partner shouldn't lift anything heavier than the baby while she's adjusting after major surgery, those complications, and now also being a mother, which is a whole other mental/hormonal change.\n\nI'd be upset too if I had all that pain, lack of sleep, and my partner popped out for - by comparison - individual fun time.", "YTA\n\nAs someone who has been a mom with a newborn, I can say that 3 weeks is not nearly enough time for a parent to be out of the house without explicit permission from the main caregiver (in this case, mom). She is in full postpartum mode with all of the stress and emotions that come along with it. I recall feeling overwhelmed and like I would do something wrong at any moment, so just having another person there who I trusted implicitly (whether it was my husband or my mom), made all the difference. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that you also feel pressure from work and having a child, but you have to put those aside for a short time while your gf continues to recover not just from a typical birth but a C section (a medical procedure) and navigates motherhood. It isn\u2019t easy; even if she makes it look that way. Even if baby seems \u201ceasy\u201d and nonfussy. It\u2019s still very early days. Mom has every right to ask for all the support she needs. Just hang in there and be her support system. With good communication you will know when the time is right to get back out running and bouldering. Good luck with the baby. Cherish this time. You\u2019ll look back one day and miss it.", "YTA. I know how bananas the newborn phase is (mom here), but the fact is that your wife is recovering form major surgery plus you both have a tiny helpless person to care for 24/7. You aren't entitled to me-time right now, sorry.", "Dude. YTA. She enjoys a lot of things too. The first 6 weeks of baby\u2019s life you generally have to give up some things you \u201creally enjoy\u201d so that everyone can literally function well enough to survive. THEN you can (and should) start talking about how EACH of you can find your own \u201cme time\u201d that\u2019s not sleeping.", "INFO - why can\u2019t you give up bouldering until\nyour wife is more recovered and stick to running (with a stroller to bring baby along?) \n\nYou do realize your wife just had her entire midsection sliced open, right? Like her whole stomach is fucked. Her abs are cut in half, her uterus - a major organ - was sliced open, along with everything else. Solid sleep is mandatory for recovery.", "YTA. She - the one who was cut open and a human was taken out of her - is letting you know she needs more support and sleep. It\u2019s literally only been 3 weeks. The recovery time is 8 weeks. Even then, babies don\u2019t typically start sleeping through the night until about 12 weeks if you\u2019re lucky. And if she\u2019s breastfeeding or pumping, she is not getting a solid sleep at all. A c-section makes breastfeeding/pumping A LOT more stressful on top of all of that.", "Ohhhhh a very chilled newborn? Well then Y N T A! Just kidding\u2026first of all, the chill part may not last too long and second of all, when does your girlfriend get time away to de-stress so she doesn\u2019t go insane?\n\nLet me guess - you consider the whole 3-4 hours you take the baby while she sleeps to be her \u201cme time\u201d?  \n\nYTA", "YTA - the big issue here is you took off during the designated time you are parent in charge so your wife can sleep. And you seem to have done it without actually talking to her. Being present in the house while working from home is not the same as being the active parent. You fucked up huge. And I get it - you need an outlet. Everyone needs an outlet. But what's her outlet? \n\nI had an unplanned c-section after a very difficult labour. I also ended up in antibiotics for a fever. I had a 10lbs baby that I did not trust myself to carry up and down stairs for a solid month, and even then I was still leery until I was cleared at my six week checkup. I could barely walk the first two weeks. I was nap trapped all day with a baby on top of me which sucked some days because of my incision. My husband works from home and generally was able to pop out to help with things unless he was in a meeting. He frequently reiterated to people that his job was to take care of me so I could take care of the baby. He brought me food and drinks. He had to get up at night at least the first two weeks because I physically couldn't get out of bed to lift the baby and get sorted out to then nurse. I couldn't even stand up out of the chair for the first 2-3 weeks while holding our baby because it was so awkward and I was so weak. I didn't do any diapers until after that. I struggled to walk. Stairs were a nightmare. I didn't drive for six weeks because that's standard for when you've had a c-section. I also couldn't lift the carseat in and out of the car. The handful of times my husband had something outside the house that was an hour or more he made sure someone could come stay with me to help.\n\nYour wife is very freshly postpartum. She is still sore and bleeding. Everything hurts. She is not getting enough sleep no matter how well behaved the kid is. Mentally she is beyond exhausted. Her hormones are so fucked right now. When does she get to leave the house to do something for her? Even if she does it's not going to be comfortable because physically she's still recovering. Plus if she's breastfeeding, she probably starts leaking.\n\nStep up your game and be the partner she needs so she doesn't go insane from being stuck in the house all day with the baby.", "YTA because she doesn't get time off. You can't just leave her like that if she needs you.\n\nWhy don't you bring baby with you on your runs? By a baby jogger. \nMom sleeps. Baby sleeps. You get exercise. Triple win.", "YTA, an unplanned emergency C-section can be so hard on a woman. You\u2019re not an asshole for wanting to work out, you\u2019re an asshole for not being more considerate and adjusting the work out schedule to work with her. It\u2019s great that you took time off to help her, don\u2019t get me wrong. (Loads of men don\u2019t even bother to do that much) But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as helpful as you think it is. Give her a little more grace, it\u2019s gonna take about 6 weeks for her to heal up", "YTA- I understand that you need some time to yourself, but two hours once a week when you have a newborn is too much. For the time being, exercise at home. Your partner is recovering from a pretty invasive surgery. She needs more than month to recover physically.", "I have an extraordinarily physical job, did pelvic floor therapy before pregnancy, and had an easy birth. \nI COULD NOT WALK ONE CITY BLOCK for WEEKS post-pregnancy.\nI SEVERELY INJURED MYSELF REQUIRING MEDICATION AND STITCHES after trying to walk one city block.\nYour workout routine is a want, not a need.\nYTA", "\u201cHow do you know if you\u2019re doing it sporadically?\u201d", "So you're not going insane and just said that to make her feel bad or?\n\nAlso I'm confused 10 am - 2pm? 8am - 10am ?

And technically not allowed to lift my child, since she was over 5 pounds of weight. \n\nGive your gf sleep and rest. She needs it. Watch out for ppd , it hits hard sometimes, especially if delivery was non perfect in moms eyes", "YTA We know you know why you are the AH. Pretending you don't know is the first prong of being the AH; going to do whatever it is you want to do when you want to do it while she is anchored to a newborn is the second.  There is no argument wherein your sense of entitlement wins.", "YTA. All of these types of title lines kill me. Like I can literally tell you\u2019re the AH just by the way you phrased this. It might be wise to consult a couples counselor during this time to help you.", "Congratulations on your daughter! However, YTA. Life doesn\u2019t just go on as normal; you have a newborn baby and a partner recovering from major abdominal surgery. Your partner is dealing with some \u201cinsanity\u201d right now, and so can you.", "YTA. I know every situation is different, but I had an emergency c-section and I was not fully recovered until the one year mark. That may be in large part because I had no help and had to do everything myself. You aren't a hero for parenting, it's your job, and you should be pulling more of the weight right now as you are recovering from nothing, while she is recovering from major surgery.", "YTA she\u2019s just out of a major surgery with a resulting infection, she physically can\u2019t do anything right now and you need to be there as much as you can.  There\u2019s probably a lot of things she would love to run off and do for an hour or two, but she can\u2019t. The least you can do is stay put and help.", "I had a C-section, and it takes at least the full six weeks not to feel like you've been run over by a truck. Add in caring for an infant, and every single minute of rest and sleep is precious\n\nYTA. For insisting on going out to exercise when you have a 3-week-old infant and the C-section mom who's clearly not happy with you disappearing on her.\n\nOh, and YTA also for calling a three-week-old human \"very well-behaved.\" Newsflash: if your baby is chill it's pure luck, not that she's \"very well-behaved.\" Babies with colic and babies who sleep poorly and babies who cry a lot for no apparent reason are NOT \"poorly behaved\", they're just babies.", "The idea of my husband taking away SLEEP TIME so he could go have fun for hours THREE WEEKS AFTER A C-SECTION fills me with such rage I don't trust myself to continue this comment.\n\nYTA and your wife is clearly an angel for the moderation of her response.", "NTA, she's being unfair. If you've literally been gone a whole 6 hours this whole time she's way out of line to be giving you crap about it.", "I going against the grain here and saying NAH\n\nBoth parents even in early post partum, even when one had a c-section need to take time alone for themselves to take care of themselves.  3hrs per week of personal time doesn\u2019t seem like an unreasonable amount.\n\nThe partner does not appear to be taking time for herself based on the OPs post.  Often this is a out of a feeling of guilt that a mom would never not put the baby first.  I think the key here is to ensure that you are providing time for your partner to escape and have time for self care.", "Sleep deprivation makes one insane. You both need to understand this and laugh about it. Honesty you both should be getting out and exersing for the sake of dopamine and higher energy levels. Maybe try a different form of exercise you can all do together.", "NAH \n\nI've had two C-sections.  They're not fun and the recovery is really rough and can be painful for a while.  However, I don't think that it's unreasonable to spend 30-60 minutes out running or at the gym to keep your mental and physical health where you want it.  You can't pour from an empty cup and if you need this time to recharge then okay.  BUT find the best time to go by talking to your SO first.  There may be days you can't go because she's had a rough night or has more pain than usual.  There may also be a fear of being left alone as she may not be confident in her ability to get around or move quickly if needed.  Be aware of how she's feeling, remember she doesn't get breaks to recharge yet because she's stuck in the house. Be flexible and considerate of each other.", "NTA. You deserve a break every now and then. You're doing what you can to help, but you're not going to be much help if you don't also care for yourself mentally and physically", "NTA. The two of you should be able to work out a schedule where you can still go exercise, and she can sleep uninterrupted.", "Nta.  The newborn period is tough.  Everyone's on little sleep so it's hard.  I suggest you Ashley your schedule in bouldering days so your girlfriend can still get her rest.  This will ease as time goes in.", "NAH. I don't think spending a couple hours a week for yourself and your mental/physical health is bad, but I so think you should talk to her about it before hand. See if she is okay being alone with the baby for a couple hours, see if she needs anything, and offer her time for herself as well. \n\nI didn't have csections, but I read a comment that said to wait until the baby is 3 months old to do anything by yourself which seems insane to me. I was rock climbing 8 days after my son was born and a week after mg daughter was born. I know everyone's different, but 3 months is an insanely long period of time to not be able to have any time for yourself and your health.", "Yta", "YTA. Your partner is recovering from a *major* surgery. It's even worse if it's an emergency c-section because they just have to get in there and get the baby out. My emergency c-section took me way longer than my planned one to recover from, and I had to go through physical therapy twice (not two sessions -- two rounds of it that were several weeks long each.) I'm not saying your partner's was necessarily like that, but she just might not be letting on if she's really struggling with recovery. You *cannot* pick this time, especially in under the first month of your baby's life when your partner is at her most hormonal, to sacrifice her sleep for your exercise routine. She *needs* that time to rest. She has a need, and you have a *want*. \n\nIf you want to get out, baby wear (carefully) or put baby in the stroller and go for a walk. Exercise at home. Find another way. You're not wrong for needing some time, and I think having a healthy outlet for yourself is great, but you've gotta adjust expectations for now about what that looks like. Your gf needs more recovery time and more rest before you can think about leaving the house outside of necessities.", "YTA, your gf is healing form a very invasive, traumatic surgery, likely one she can\u2019t take many pain meds for if she\u2019s breast feeding AND caring for a newborn. You need to be home as much as possible\u2014it\u2019s only been 3 weeks. Find workouts to do at home.", "YTA", "YTA I think you should still be able to exercise but maybe hold off on leaving the house unless you ask your gf if she\u2019ll be okay for that brief time period\u2026 don\u2019t forget post partum could be at play too. My wife just gave birth about 6 weeks ago, she healed fairly fast, I stayed home the whole time up until maybe week 4 or 5. But would always ask if she didn\u2019t mind if I went to x place for x reason. I think asking first would be huge. I was lucky no PP and she\u2019s healing pretty quick that being said I\u2019ve taken on as many chores as possible to prevent her from over exerting herself.", "YTA\n\nMan she got vivisected and you expect her to do more than half the babycare while you only do 5/6 hours at night??", "YTA\nYou went back to normal WAY too quickly. You assume you have an easy baby but, don't get comfortable.\n\nYour poor girlfriend on the other hand had to go through an EMERGENCY c-section which was probably traumatic for her.\n\nShe also has to deal with her partner wanting to go off and have fun while she has to deal with the baby. \nWorking from home is fine but, you need to plan your time better. Ask your girlfriend what SHE wants to do. She's the one that's allowed to be selfish for a few weeks.\n\nSo, stop acting like the hero and give your girlfriend the hero treatment. \n\nYou could always reschedule your day to day life after a few months", "YTA and so are all the pick me\u2019s in this sub.

You seem to have read a lot of posts where people in the comments were calling men out for wanting to have children but not wanting to be fathers, for thinking childcare is \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d but then wondering why they didn\u2019t bond with their newborn, for \u201cbabysitting\u201d their own kids and for pressuring women into having sex a few weeks postpartum. You read all that and then tried to phrase your post in a way that we wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019re that kinda guy. Are you actively trying to be manipulative or was that an unconscious decision? You are that kinda guy.", "YTA. She sacrificed her life and body to bring the kid into the world and is now recovering from it.

Soft because you're a man and you've likely just never been faced with the concept of being completely selfless. You're off to a good start. But here's the thing: your girlfriend is not \"healthy\" rn. Even if not for the infection, she had MAJOR SURGERY only a few weeks ago. The fucked up thing is that you're not supposed to lift anything after abdominal surgery but you get sent home with a newborn after a c-section. And adding an infection on top of that, this woman is sick and exhausted. So sick and exhausted. She needs you all in.", "Ehhhh against the grain. NAH. She is in her right to be stressed after a surgery, and PPD is definitely a possibility. Just like when she is preggo, some things just don\u2019t make sense.

My girlfriend gave birth via an emergency C section after initially being induced and an infection occurring somewhere during the labour process. \n\nFast forward 3 weeks and mum and baby are healthy, and we are extremely happy in our little newborn bubble. I have done everything I can to make my partners recovery as seamless as possible, this includes taking the evening shift 10-1/2 to occupy my baby whilst mum sleeps, ready for the disjointed sleep she gets between 2 and 7/8am.  The baby is very well behaved and operates in a 3hour cycle of feed/sleep/feed and very rarely cries or is disgruntled(I'm quite surprised at how relaxed she is tbh).\n\nI have been on paternity leave for two weeks(1 used while being induced/the other for initial newborn time), and have returned to WFH for 3 days across the last 2 weeks so am still present in the house. Now the issue has arisen that I enjoy bouldering once a week on a Wednesday from 8-10 and am home for 1030.i have done this twice in the last couple of weeks and chose to go for a half hour run this evening because work has been full on and I needed to destress. All in all I have probably been out the house for exercise for around 6 hours in two weeks. \n\nMy partner has taken great offense at my decision to do this because its meant that she has missed out on a couple of hours of uninterrupted sleep because I haven't been here to occupy our baby downstairs. This has resulted in her calling me selfish, distant and uninterested for which I honestly believe I have not been because Ive done nothing but wait hand and foot on her to ensure that she is in the best place physically and mentally. \n\nWe have kinda argued about this situation and in the moment I said I need the break in our current routine to exercise to ensure I don't go Insane (I'm not going insane, I'm very much enjoying the newborn bubble but it's a figure of speech I used and its been taken literally) \n\nSo question is, AITA for wanting to exercise whilst my GF is at home with a (very chilled) newborn.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "She just had her guts cut open, literally her muscles pulled apart and a baby pulled through. Going for a piss is painful sitting is painful moving is painful. Every damn thing will be painful she will be on extremely limited movement as not to cause an infection pulling her multiple layers of stitches that keep her guts in. A workout is a slap in her face when she would probably love to take a shit without worrying about busting some stitches. It's been 3 weeks not 3 months I'm sure you could of held off till she's feeling better yta and if you just had to go did you find anyone to help her? I'm pretty sure even just carrying the baby is dangerous in the first month", "There's a lot of new things happening. Next time, I would get a jogging stroller and take the baby out.

And she gets to be the boss right now!\n\nI will say that I\u2019m very envious of all of the moms who have had a partner be able to stay home with them for so long! We are a farm family, which means my husband was back out to work as soon as we got home from the hospital. I had four c-sections in 7 years, so I know a thing or two about recovery, and it\u2019s not easy. But, I also know that we can do hard things! My husband made sure to take a shift at night so I could for sure get a few solid hours of sleep, as well as sole duties for any other kid that happened to get up at night. But other than that, I was on my own from day 3 or 4. \n\nThe difference here is that my husband wasn\u2019t out doing something for *him*, he was working for *us*. It\u2019s hard to ask the boss for paternity leave when the boss is you and a bunch of cows. I know he would have rather been home, but he couldn\u2019t. I know I would have loved more help, but he couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s just how it was, and we made it work. But if he was out hanging with his buddies, we would have had a problem!", "Yes, YTA.

You need to adjust your expectations.   There might be a few more weeks (the recovery time for a new mom is at least 6 weeks) where your partner needs more support.  You might need to plan your exercise times, and be less spontaneous.   And you might need to get some equipment like a front carrier for walking/hiking, or a good jogging stroller or bike trailer.

She spent presumably 9 months growing a child you created together and now will have at least 9 months to become herself again fully (some of us have very noticeable differences in our post baby bods). As the baby grows and she isn't recovering you'll be able to set a schedule between the 2 of you to meet baby's needs and your own. The runs might be your only option for a while.

She is probably a little resentful because she most likely feels like she\u2019s all alone in her feelings and can\u2019t leave the house and work out so why should you. Not saying that\u2019s ok, everyone deserves to be able to leave the \u201cnewborn bubble\u201d but she isn\u2019t capable of explaining this to you quite yet because she probably doesn\u2019t even realize that\u2019s what it is.
