We also made sure to attend every birthday and big event for her and her family. She never makes an effort to celebrate our birthdays or big life accomplishments, so I didn\u2019t expect much. \n\nShe kept insisting on being included in the wedding, so I invited her to cake tasting. She brought her teething infant, and he proceeded to scream the whole time, to the point where it wasn\u2019t enjoyable at all. \n\nI continued hanging out with her after that but stopped inviting her to wedding events. She eventually expressed how she felt excluded and was upset. I confessed that I found out 2 years prior that I\u2019m infertile, and although I\u2019m always happy to be around her and the kids, I wanted the wedding to be the one thing that\u2019s not about her kids.\n\nShe seemed to understand. I invited her to try on bridesmaid dresses and picked a location close to her house, so her husband can watch the kids and then we\u2019ll all hang out after. Nothing seemed wrong. \n\nA month later, she blew up again saying I\u2019m not including her. I didn\u2019t plan much at that point, but invited her to have a craft day for my bridal shower. We never discussed who was hosting the craft day, and I was planning on going over there. But after she pitched no ideas and made no offer to buy the supplies, I told her it would be best to come to my place since all the supplies are there. I invited her husband and kids too. \n\nShe said the kids aren\u2019t comfortable outside of their own environment and refused to come over. I have always accommodated her needs, but this time I pushed back, because I shouldn\u2019t have to bend over backwards for my bridesmaid. \n\nShe flipped out and said \u201dI understand you don\u2019t get it because you don\u2019t have kids.\u201d I took a day to cool down and then called her the next day. I told her what she said was very hurtful. She said \u201cyou don\u2019t get it and you won\u2019t get it\u201d about 3 times during the conversation. She also played the victim and said I didn\u2019t make the dress fitting more kid friendly, and I never consider the kids and am being selfish. \n\nAfter my brother talked to her, she apologized a week after their conversation. The apology was basically \u201csorry for saying that. The text didn\u2019t come through how I intended.\u201d I thanked her for the apology but told her that\u2019s bs because if the text was actually misinterpreted, she wouldn\u2019t have repeated it during our phone call. I did say I wanted to meet in person and talk further, but she said she didn\u2019t want to because no matter what she says will upset me and she\u2019s done with me. \n\nOf course she told our whole family what happened, and they said I\u2019m too sensitive and should have accepted her apology.

It sounds like you have done just about everything you could to include her, even trying to incorporate her family into some of the activities and setting clear, polite boundaries when that wasn't working out well. It sounds like your sister is used to having the entire world revolve around her and that she is probably jealous that the focus is (rightfully) on you for once.\n\nIf this is how toxic your family is, maybe consider eloping.", "Nta, she's continually being a cow.  Is she jealous of your wedding plans? She's complaining that you aren't including her & then making it difficult to impossible to include her. She can't have it both ways. Either she wants to be involved & make an effort or she doesn't. I'd make sure that your parents (& whoever else is sticking their nose in) knows about the lack of involvement from her side. Don't let her dampen your celebrations.", "NTA.\n>She also played the victim and said I didn\u2019t make the dress fitting more kid friendly.\n\nWhat? Is the occasion about a child? No. So WHY would a BRIDAL/BRIDESMAID dress fitting be kid friendly?!", "NTA\n\nWhen apologising make it sincere or don't do it at all. Apologising is recognising you've done something that hurts somebodies feelings and so it should never be expected that straight after you become best buddies again. You have to wait to be forgiven and that doesn't happen because you said sorry.", "NTA. some things aren\u2019t meant to be attended by babies. Sometimes your sister can\u2019t participate in those things. That doesn\u2019t mean you should have to do only baby-friendly things in life, and you weren\u2019t a dock about her not being there for those.", "NTA, I have kids and wouldn\u2019t expect to bring them  wedding dress shopping for a family member. She\u2019s expecting too much. It is your wedding, not hers.", "NTA your sister is.", "NTA, she wants to be involved but isn\u2019t offering to involve herself in any decisions or planning unless they\u2019re about her kids.", "NTA.  It's funny how the person who's being selfish and overly sensitive pretends to be the victim when called out.  Certain events don't have to include children, especially if the parents are unable to keep them from being disruptive.  Also, as an adult, you sister should understand that she won't necessarily be invited to every party.  Though it's understandable that her feelings might be hurt, it's not okay to force yourself on people and get angry and lash out if you're not included.  Let's not forget that you seem to have gone out of your way to spend time with your sister and her family, and you attempted to make accommodations so she could be more involved, but she was inflexible, and again acted out.", "NTA but your sister is a MAJOR one! I think she's intentionally pushing her kids excuses at you because she knows you can't have them. Her excuses are just that.. excuses and playing the victim. It's a shame your family is falling for it! I'm sure your ceremony will be beautiful and peaceful without all the negative drama she brings with her.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding, she can grow up or get lost", "NTA\n\nI truly get where you\u2019re coming from & had a very similar experience with my sister when my kids were younger. She was always at our house (her apartment was not very big) & we have a  large house & huge kitchen in a beautiful remote area with a pool, hot tub, game room so I never really thought about whether it was convenient or not for her just figured she wanted be here. \n\nWhen her fianc\u00e9 purposed we threw a big party (at my house) & she asked me to be her MOH & for my help with her wedding(I am a wedding/event planner) Of course, I agreed but I already had 2 paying clients I was working with & 4 young children so I did not make hers a priority & made it really challenging for her by requesting she & her husband & bridal party always meet at my house. She complained a couple times but I always had an excuse why I wasn\u2019t able to do it her way. Fast forward.... Her friends ended up taking charge & doing all the heavy lifting. \n\nI honestly had no clue what was going on & I just showed up on the day of the wedding. I helped her get dressed & we drove to the ceremony together just her & I (we were signing & laughing) but it just hit me like a ton of bricks what a colossal mistake I had made. My little sister was getting married & I had paid no attention to her. Worse its my literal job to plan weddings! Had a bunch of excuses but there\u2019s no good excuse for not making family a priority. I felt like the worst person on the planet. We got through the day, I never said  anything about how I fucked up, it was her day. I wrote her a 2 page apology letter that night. We cried & talked about it when she was ready to accept my apology. I have never made the same mistake with her again. It\u2019s 10 years later & even typing this now still makes me call her an apologize again lol.\n\nI hope your sister realizes sooner than later relationships take effort, we get out of it what we put in. If you put nothing in, don\u2019t expect to get anything back. Wish you all the best!!\n\nETA \u2014 should probably have included my house is on the top of a mountain, 30 minutes to the closest store & definitely not convenient for anyone to get to (especially in the winter). My sister lives 45 minutes away from me (across the street from her good friend who was in her wedding) in a much more convenient location for everyone but I made everyone come here... I was the AH", "NTA, I am sorry your sister is not able and willing to make your special day about you and instead uses every opportunity to guilt trip you with her busy family life while making you - the bride - the bad guy for basically not planing the wedding around her little  world. How entitled and disgusting of her.", "NTA.  No obligation, ever, to accept a true apology.  This was not even a true apology.  Your sister is TA.  You know she does not value you from her past conduct.  You know she makes everything about herself.  She even disclosed your internal discussions, according to her perception, to get others to press you.  Wake up.  See who she is.  Run away and cut contact.", "NTA - your sister doesn\u2019t get to continuously complain she\u2019s feeling left out and then force you to accommodate her needs and her children every time.  She was also unnecessarily cruel with the you\u2019ll never get it remarks. \n\nBottom line she owes you a sincere apology.", "ESH, both of you are acting like children, she shouldn't have said anything about your infertility, up until she talked about your infertitlity i would have said she was NTA and you were the AH but after that rollercoaster, yes, ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I no longer accept any clients whose \u201cvision\u201d is ridiculously over the top or their goals are unattainable.

I learned the hard way that people will lose their minds & ruin their own events over the most absurd & unimportant details that no one could have anticipated nor resolved. (The bride has her period, let\u2019s all lose our shit & cry together while we keep the guests waiting ...WTF) \n\nThey will also be told their expectations are not realistic & will want it anyway (when you choose to hold your reception in a barn (without running water & power) in the middle of summer, no one will be able to help your guests while sweat to death & get attacked by uninvited bugs no matter how much you complain about it) \u2014 \u201cSounds good!

The goal is to get married... not about dresses, flowers, gifts, alcohol, seating, speeches, attitudes, no one can stop the entire world from spinning for one day. 2 people can accomplish the getting married goal on their own.

Then stay lc with her if she isn\u2019t reciprocating all of the effort that your doing to try to be involved with her families lives I would stop trying honestly.. sister or not it doesn\u2019t seem as though your sister cares if you are there or not.. she\u2019s using her kids as an excuse if she really wanted to be more involved in your life she would be.. no excuses", "the best thing to do when you're in the wrong is not to ADMIT you're in the wrong but to make counteraccusations and play the victim \n\nthe OP's sister has learned the lesson well and should be congratulated on her execution of the skill\n\n /s", "NTA\n\nI know we're not the same, but my sister is the dramatic favorite. You know the situation better then I do, so take my advice as you will.\n\nRelationships are give and take. Your Sister? Take. Take. Take. Me. Me. Me. There's a sub called r/raisedbynarcissists that is the extreme version of people like this. Your sister clearly isn't your parent and she doesn't have to be a narcissist for you to get some insight from the sub. It's just that obvious examples of behavior are easy to learn from.\n\nYour situation seems like a whole lot of putting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. \n\nYour sister doesn't seem like she's going to change. She doesn't talk to you as an equal. She talks down to you like you're a dog she needs to reprimand. It's clear she doesn't respect you.\n\nShe doesn't seem to understand that her intentions don't negate the damage she causes. Your sister seems to be putting all of her anger on you. Like, you're the cause and she's making you be the one to fix it. It's not your job to manage her emotions.\n\nHer kids? Her whole thing that's going on with her? Let her be her own problem. If she would've changed, she would've changed already. Repeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome is madness.\n\nYour sister isn't holding herself accountable. So, you need to treat her the way she's showing you how to treat her. \n\nYour options are to continue interacting with her or to not do so.\n\nIf you want to continue interacting with her, you need to set boundaries. Her intentions don't negate the outcome of what she's done to you. If treating you as an equal human being isn't a boundary she can respect, then you'd need to decide what you want to do about it.\n\nIf you ask her not to be cruel to you and she continues with it, she's consciously choosing to be mean.\n\nYou could also choose not to interact with her.\n\nI tried to maintain a relationship with my sister, but she made me responsible for her happiness. She didn't learn and she didn't change. If she did something wrong, her apology was supposed to always make up for whatever harm she did.\n\nShe claimed that my asking her to apologize was bullying her. The cycle continued between me trying to get her to treat me like a person and her claiming that asking for that was bullying her. Eventually, I realized that no one is entitled to a relationship with someone. Even family. \n\nYou can say that you love someone while acknowledging that they're bad for you. You can cut them off, refuse, or limit interaction if they don't treat you like a person.\n\nThe best decision I made was to limit interaction and let my sister be her own problem.\n\nYour sister is acting like everything's about her and appears overwhelmed with everything that you do. You can choose to limit her or rescind her being a bridesmaid if she can't handle the situation.\n\nThis isn't about your sister. This is about you and your wedding.  Think about how you want this to go and what you think will happen.", "NTA you did nothing wrong and have gone out of your way to include her. It would probably cause too much drama to drop her as a bridesmaid but definitely put passwords on everything.", "She paid $50 for her dress but told my mom she no longer will be attending the wedding. My mom said to pay for her dress so she has one less issue against me, but I am refusing to pay for it as she made the choice not to patch things up with me. I offered to talk in person and come to better terms, but she didn\u2019t want to. She also never told me she doesn\u2019t want to be in the wedding, but I haven\u2019t spoken to her in over 3 months so I\u2019m assuming she won\u2019t be attending.", "Go LC.\n\nI am a firm believer that relationships are a two way street and you should only put in the effort that you receive back.\n\nI get it, people are busy, people are in different places in life. But we make time for what we want to make time for. I\u2019ll be fully transparent, there are people that I don\u2019t make an effort for because I rather watch tv then spend time with them. But it\u2019s a subconscious choice that I never realized I did until someone told me.\n\nWe all make choices and prioritize what we want.\n\nNTA. And reevaluate your relationship with her. A relationship is a two way street.", "I read this comment thread and wanted to add my own input! My fianc\u00e9 and I have been doing all the wedding planning. I didn\u2019t have a bachelorette party and only a bridal shower, which was the one thing I expected everyone to show up to. The bridesmaid dresses were $50 and everyone had an option whether or not they wanted their hair and makeup professionally done. \n\nMy maid of honor planned the whole bridal shower, for she genuinely enjoys event planning. I even offered to help and she refused, stating I deserve to relax for once. \n\nI understand weddings are expensive and even if a member of the bridal party couldn\u2019t afford their dress or to attend the bridal shower, I would have paid for them. I never would expect any of my friends to drop everything for me, but some enjoy the planning element and genuinely want to be involved. \n\nI have seen some weddings on social media and couldn\u2019t get over the price tag. I couldn\u2019t imagine doing that to my bridal party."]}
