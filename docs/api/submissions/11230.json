What you can control is your own money and how you spend it, and so don't spend it on him.", "NTA, but next time he should explain to the electric company how his weed is more important when they\u2019re going to cut his power. You\u2019re on a slippery slope OP and you just let him justify his actions. Not one single other person in his life would cut him slack for the importance of his weed. Not his job, landlord, creditors. No one but you. Are you going to enable him forever? Because he doesn\u2019t have to hustle to have his needs met if he has you doing it for him.

He is not a boyfriend, he's a parasite. You're living together (probably moved into your place), he doesn't have a reliable income, you're paying all the bills AND you're giving him an allowance to buy weed. I don't believe for a minute he needs it for anxiety -- if that was real, he'd be seeing a therapist and getting an actual prescription. But he doesn't because he has already learned that he can guilt you into buying him \"medicine\" that's much more fun.\n\nThis is a picture of what your life is going to be like forever with this loser. You're going to be supporting him, cleaning up after him, buying him weed, and taking care of him. Dump him and take your life back.", "NTA.  You gave a reasonable solution which he turned down.

I use THC for anxiety (weed isn\u2019t legal where I am) but mostly because I can\u2019t afford a psychiatrist/medication. I\u2019ve also used weed recreationally since high school. Imo, more than $100 on weed a week is a ridiculous amount and way more than a person would usually need to help with anxiety. Of corse people have different tolerance levels so it\u2019s impossible for me to know how that amount affects him. \n\nIt\u2019s also concerning that he doesn\u2019t want to seek therapy or any other medical treatment. Has he mentioned why he doesn\u2019t want to see a professional? I know I tried therapy before I was ready and it didn\u2019t stick but if he\u2019s medicating himself that heavily I would think that he\u2019d recognize he needs outside help. If you\u2019re in therapy maybe you could get him to tag along to an appointment to discuss this issue.\n\nAt the end of the day, bills come first.

Whether it\u2019s variable or not, the information here is that you paid his bills and  he made $250/week over the last two weeks. He cannot spend $210 per week on something that is not essential (i.e. we are not talking about heart failure or asthma medication).\n\nLet him mooch off of someone else or get an actual job. Maybe not smoking constantly will allow him to pick up more clients.", "NTA. If his anxiety is that bad then he can see a Psychiatrist and get actual medication for WAY cheaper with health insurance.", "I feel like I\u2019m being taken advantage of. He refuses to get a better job. He loves being a personal trainer but he only made $15000 for the year. I asked him to get a different job for right now and do training on the side but he says I\u2019m being materialistic. I worry about his weed habit but he says he will never quit.", "NTA. Being high 24/7 as a self treatment for anxiety is not good.", "NTA\nHe's using you. He spends almost all his income on weed and guilt trips you when you mention this.", "NTA, but both of you need therapy- you need it to help set healthy boundaries.

Seriously why are you with this guy?", "NTA but he needs to take a tolerance break. The more you smoke, the more you need. That's why regular smokers will not smoke for periods of time so their tolerance doesn't outstripe their ability to pay. Tell him to cut back or stop for a period before you even consider loaning him another penny.", "You don\u2019t owe him anything for this, he is self \u201cmedicating\u201d and refusing actual professional help. \nAlso $70 2-3 times a week is insane. He is either smoking a nuts amount (like over an OZ a week level) or he\u2019s absolutely awful at finding deals on good weed, either way you\u2019re NTA. \n\nIf he can\u2019t afford it then he shouldn\u2019t be doing it. Weed can help with anxiety but can and is done by smoking a much much less amount. \nSmoking that much to cope with anxiety isn\u2019t  medicating, it\u2019s using weed to avoid actually confronting his problems (whether that be anxiety or more). This is coming from someone who did exactly this for years.", "holy shit, if this isn't fake, you need a reality check. your \"boyfriend\" barely even makes enough money to pay for his own weed.\n\n70x2.5 = $175\n\n175x 2 weeks = $350 in 2 weeks on wee\n\n350/500 = .7 = **70%**\n\nyour \"boyfriend\" spends **70%** of his income on weed and you don't see a problem?\n\nNTA, ask him if you can borrow 300 after his paycheck comes in then break up", "NTA. If he wants to smoke that much maybe he should get a better paying job. He\u2019s using you.", "NTA\n\nSo he spends up to $800 on weed and you pay his bills? Sweet deal! What are you getting out of it?", "NTA, but an enabler. Get out now.", "On the top end, he's spending $210 a week on week ($70 x 3)\n\nThat's a potential $840 a month in weed costs; nearly a grand a month and I saw in a comment that he brought in $15,000 last year.\n\nIt's not sustainable to theoretically spend 67.2% of his yearly income on weed.\n\nAs a daily smoker myself, I can almost guarantee that half of his anxiety comes from simply just not smoking. I laugh at the people who say weed isn't addictive or that it doesn't have any addictive qualities - I'm not delusional about the fact that I get anxious and irritable if I go without smoking for more than a day or two, so stop kidding yourself.\n\nNTA - if it really is an anxiety issue then he needs to talk to a professional instead of spending all of his money self-medicating.", "NTA and this is coming from someone who uses weed to medicate and also smokes just about as much as he does. I get it when I can afford to spend the money. If I have a bad paycheck, or especially if I need some financial assistance from family or friends for whatever reason, the first thing to go is the weed. Bills always come first. \nHim saying he doesn't want to try therapy is also a huge red flag.", "NTA. If he can't support his habit then he can't have it. \n\nTherapy is the correct course here, you don't have to pay for his smoking...or his therapy, btw.  This is all on him.  If he chooses to not seek help, you may want to rethink your relationship. He's already tapped you as a financial source, these kinds of situations only devolve.", "NTA. The huge red flag here is that he does have other options to help with his anxiety and just doesn\u2019t want to do it. I\u2019m a smoker and had a financial problem last year, I usually would smoke vape but since it was becoming to expensive for me to continue with that I\u2019ve changed to organic tabaco since it\u2019s cheaper where I live. I know that I\u2019m an addict and I should\u2019ve tried to stop completely but I compromised with my situation. Maybe if he isn\u2019t keen to therapy, try talk to him about cutting back his usage.", "NTA. Often times, when a doctor prescribes a patient a SSRI for anxiety  they say they also recommend therapy along with it because recovery happens from both medication and therapy. Your boyfriend needs therapy to deal with his anxiety. He will need more and more weed to get high if he continues smoking at this volume and the anxiety will continue to get worse.", "NTA - He is not your child who deserves an allowance.  He's a grown ass man and a stoner who can't manage to take care of himself and is wasting money on weed.  Cut him off and frankly you are being an AH to yourself to continue this relationship.", "NTA. You need a new boyfriend, you have different goals.", "He rejects therapy and want to smoke weed he can't afford. On top of that, he's basically leeching off you. That does not sound like someone you could build a like with.\n\nTrust me - the more you fork out, the more he will become entitled to your money, with his hand out every month going forward. \n\nNTA but I think you would be the AH if you didn't nip this in the bud.", "NTA If he has inconsistent paychecks coming in, is borrowing money, refuses to cut back, and doesn't want to go to therapy to try and help him with his anxiety, then maybe you could decide you don't want to be his personal bank anymore.", "So he's making $250 per week and spending $140-210 per week on weed? I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to rethink his budgeting. Sounds like he is living way beyond his means and you are enabling that by covering his expenses so he can blow all his money on weed (I'm a daily smoker btw). I don't think you're TA but I would be thinking long and hard about your role in this relationship if I were you.", "NTA.  If he doesn't want to the right help himself, it's not your job to help him financially.", "NTA. This isn't a boyfriend, this is a sugar baby.", "YTA for allowing yourself to be used as an ATM. Also, he must stink really badly of weed, smoking that often. No way would I want a personal trainer who stinks of weed to be giving me any sort of advice on what to be doing with my body/workouts when clearly they don\u2019t respect their own body. No wonder he is earning so little, he can\u2019t have many clients. I\u2019m not even going to go down the route of pointing out that you\u2019re a health care professional. Grow a spine OP.", " NTA but definitely a ATM!", "NTA. and stop giving him money. If he doesn't have enough to pay his bills, that's on him. You're enabling his habit that you don't like, so you need to shop and let him figure it out.", "NTA.\n\nIf not for your concern for his anxiety and general naivette, I'd actually call you an asshole for enabling his addiction.\n\nHe smokes way too heavily.\n\nSure weed has medical use, but for medical purpose it needs to be prescribed by actual physician.", "NTA. That's a LOT to be spending on weed!", "NTA- Person who uses medical cannabis here and I personally know how expensive it can be, especially in my area where they only allowed 3 dispensaries within the city. I have my card for legitimate reasons, but my bills come first. The weed does help me get by in life, but it is not a substitute for life. In life we still have responsibilities, we still have jobs to do and bills to pay. It isn't fair on you that his weed habit- and at this point it is definitely a habit if not a dependancy- is effecting your finances because he can't keep up with his own. There are cheaper ways to get longer use out of medical cannabis. For example, I swapped from flower and pre-rolls to edibles and vapes. a 1 gram vape lasts me about 2 weeks compared to what I used to burn through with the same amount in flower and pre-rolls. Edibles too, get some that are high enough in THC and you can divide up the gummy or whatever over the course of several days given how long the effects last. I have anxiety, I have depression, I have chronic pain, issues sleeping, and a lot of different reasons for having my med card... But I learned how to budget my life with my 'medicine', and your boyfriend needs to do the same. Protect yourself, protect your finances, and if he's not willing to change his ways, seek the help he clearly needs, or take some measures to cut back on cost then you might need to think about what's best for you and what you want in the future. Also, he is gaslighting you a bit; attaching his medical situation to his dependency on weed. Cut him off.\n\nQuick Edit: As many others stated, cannabis can also exasperate anxiety without the addition of coping mechanisms that can be learned by a therapist. And for some people with anxiety, like my sibling, they can't use it at all without triggering panic and anxiety attacks.", "NTA tell him to see a psychiatrist to get medication to treat his anxiety (medication that won\u2019t hurt his lungs and as an athlete he should really be concerned about his lungs). What he is 140-210 a week for week? So minimum of $600 a month, and he\u2019s self medicating, not being seen by a doctor.

Dude spends $10k a year on weed and wonders why he is broke.", "You being a nurse should know that taking something that is undiagnosed is not good. So right now the weed is a luxury to him and if he want to support the habit than find a job that pays his bills and he has leftovers for the luxury", "You\u2019re NTA, but your boyfriend is. He\u2019s 33 years old and should be able to support himself. He needs another job besides personal trainer. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t want to work out with a personal trainer that is a heavy smoker. That isn\u2019t healthy. It\u2019s also not healthy to self-medicate for anxiety. He needs to see a doctor for actual medicine and possibly a therapist. Please consider where this relationship is going. You two are financially incompatible, and he seems manipulative. Good luck to you.", "Hahahahahahaha NTA. Time to peel this barnacle off and toss him back in the sea. Your boyfriend is a loser", "Nta, but theres way cheaper medicine for anxiety, right now you are just paying his addiction", "\\> He is a heavy smoker and smokes multiple times a day and gets $70 worth of weed 2-3x a week.\n\nThat sounds like a stoner who is addicted to getting high all day and doing nothing.\n\nCannabis can be great medicine, but it sounds like he's abusing it recreationally and not for medicine.  People who take it for anxiety usually microdose, so they're still functional adults. Or they'll use it more heavily if they're having an episode.  He's just getting stoned all day, every day, and pretty much nothing else.  The only medical use I've heard for the quantity I'm imagining, is with cancer patients. They're either consuming a lot to deal with nausea, or are making concentrated RSO to try and shrink tumors.", "NTA - therapy would be cheaper than a smoking habit that strong, and unlike the smoking, which is more by way of a relief/escape in most instances, therapy might actually help address the causes and manage the anxiety.", "NTA", "NTA - daily medical marijuana used here.

Then it's just an excuse.", "you are, he is a user", "If he makes 15k a year he doesn't get to spend 9-10k a year on weed. Full stop.", "If he will not compromise thats a red flag. You need to think long and hard on why you're staying with him. Are you doing it out of comfort? Out of attachment of having someone there? Breaking it off will be hard and will hurt, but you'll heal and grow from it and be so much better in the long run. He is dragging you down and holding you back. There are so many guys out there who can offer you better.", "I did but then he just said that he sacrifices a lot for me to go back to school and that I don\u2019t sacrifice anything. He said this because I still go out and spend time with my friends when I have a day available once a month. Also he seemed upset that I spent money on a trip to Nashville to go to my friend\u2019s bachelorette party in august.", "This! That isn't 'managing anxiety' that's getting stoned off your face", "Also I live in an illegal state and at those prices he's still smoking a lot of weed even if it's good stuff. Either that or I just have a great guy.", "The problem really is that when you buy small quantities the amount goes up.   8 x 1/8 costs way more than just 1oz to start with.  (at least where I am from)", "Yeah thats alot. He probably makes more than 13k since it fluctuates but spending that much on weed is asinine if youre in the US for the most part. He needs to buy in bulk once or twice a month if he is going to keep up this habit rather than 2 or 3 times a week. He is blowing money.", "How long are you willing to be patient while he blows money away on weed and looks at you like an atm?", "I\u2019m not trying to be an ass but why do you want to be with him? This doesn\u2019t sound fun for you at all. It\u2019s great that he has aspirations but considering his motivation and drive I have a feeling he\u2019ll make excuses and eventually give up on it. It\u2019s ridiculous that he is holding out, what does making money now have to do with him opening a gym later? That\u2019s like saying that you aren\u2019t going to work because you can\u2019t get a job in nursing till you have your degree and that\u2019s what you want to do. No, you do what you have to do so you can pay your bills right now. That\u2019s being an adult\u2026", "How is he going to open his own gym? He\u2019s ok with you working that much? His income is literally the federal minimum wage (which is horrible but not my point). He clearly isn\u2019t crushing it with personal training clients now, so how exactly will he be opening a gym? With your money, I would guess.", "Either that or he's anxious that she's going to wise up and kick him to the curb.", "He gives me money too. It usually because I run out. I\u2019m trying to get out of debt from school. It depends. Since January I have given him $900 from Venmo. But I also do all the errands. I pay for his dog\u2019s vet bills. Which is $70 every month. I also pay for necessities and I just spent money on a cruise for us.", "Wait what? We went from too bad with money and spending too much on weed to someone who resents you for hanging out with friends *once a month* and *one* trip with friends??? And to top that off, he also seems manipulative. \n\nI know we aren't getting the full picture from one post and comment, but this really, really does not sound good for you.", "You're not responsible for his excuses. What was that bud money? That was a sacrifice you didn't need to make. I wouldn't have. What are you supposed to do, abandon all your friends and give up any personal time because he can't control himself? I think not. This is a weird new world where bud is just part of daily life but like any medication it's his own responsibility to manage it. If he can't you shouldn't be subsidizing his medicine.", "let's give him a little credit, if I was in his position, I'd be pretty anxious I might have to actually work and be an adult again when/if they realizes they deserved better.\n\nIt is way past time to throw that boyfriend out with the bongwater", "If that's the case dude needs to shop smarter. I'm in a legal state and my roommate and I strategize to get the most for our weed budget. \n\nIf he doesn't trust himself to get an ounce and not smoke it all at once he really does have a problem.", "I\u2019m a LPN right now and when I get my RN I\u2019ll make a lot more money. I feel like he expects me to give him the start up money. He also says he will be the stay home dad so idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I just don\u2019t know how to motivate him. But I can\u2019t bring it up again because he says this will break us up", "I mean he's making minimum wage at a job where people generally outperform minimum wage significantly.", "If you're feeling used and he's threatening to break up with you for not giving him money, this is an abusive situation. I know you probably don't want to hear it, but he doesn't get to threaten you into doing what he wants. That's abuse.", "Dump him, keep the dog. It'll be a lot cheaper and at least the dog won't smoke.", "It\u2019s the stuff he brought up when I asked him to cut back. I\u2019m in a lout of debt since I went and got my nursing degree and I\u2019m still continuing my education to advance. I\u2019ve paid off $9000 almost so far. He says it\u2019s my fault that we are in this financial situation and that i just want him to help me pay off my debt faster. I just want help financially so we don\u2019t have to live with his dad", "Probably much, much worse. He asked for $150 for weed and when she suggested he cut back on consumption, he guilt-tripped her so badly she gave him $300.\n\nHe either already knew this trick on how to get *more* money out of OP than he asked for, or he just learned it. Either way, it's his playbook from now on. He already has OP apologizing for using her own money to visit friends *once a month* instead of just letting him have it.\n\nBoyfriend is absolutely toxic. Definitely emotionally abusive, gaslighting her about how \"he does so much,\" needs weed for his \"anxiety,\" etc. The next step will be stealing from her or physical intimidation.\n\nShe needs to get out of this relationship NOW.", "I don't disagree.", ">But I can\u2019t bring it up again because he says this will break us up\n\nDoes he do this a lot? Threaten to break up with you if you don't give in to what he wants? \n\nYou may not realize this, but this sounds like an abusive situation. He expects you to fund his life, otherwise he's out? That's not love and you deserve more than that. \n\nI'm sure he's made you feel as though you can't leave him, but I promise you can. I promise life is better without someone constantly threatening to leave you unless you do exactly what they want you to do. \n\nIt sounds like you're a hard worker, smart, have a promising future ahead of you. Do not tie yourself down to someone like this. He's a preying on you.", "You would be wildly irresponsible to have a child with a man smoking this much weed. I\u2019m actually read to call you an AH for even considering making this dude a father.", "Girl, run! I don\u2019t know either of you but can tell you can do sooooo much better. Leave him. Now.\n\nDon\u2019t you want to be able to take vacations? Buy a house? Have a nice car? You will have none of those if you stay with him because he will stay a bum and bleed you dry. However, with the money you make as an RN you could stay single and have all of those! Not to mention, you are going to meet so many new people and have so many opportunities for friendships and love interests.\n\nHave you looked into travel nursing? I\u2019m jealous of my friends who do that. They live in super cool places for three months at a time (and up to a year) AND make like $60/hr while doing it. They essentially get paid over $100k/year to vacation. Sure they still work but it\u2019s typically three 12 hour shifts so they have four days a week off to party and explore whatever cool city they are living in. \n\nIt\u2019s all on you to change your life. However, you can do it and it\u2019s not even going to be hard!", "Sounds like a good thing to me.  You\u2019re not getting anything from this relationship", "bring it up ASAP", "Eesh as someone who uses marijuana to manage anxiety, this is a LOT of weed. He needs to motivate himself to cut back and if he can't, I think you should reconsider the relationship. $70 multiple times a week is a LOT of weed smoking and likely hampering his own internal motivation to get almost anything done. You don't want a stoner stay at home dad. Edit: NTA", "Have you expressed this directly to him? I learned a while back people are not mind readers and if they only see one side of the financial situation they can't make useful or helpful remarks.   \nLet him see (when not high) what the income is looking like versus the money going out, and that you are trying to avoid living with anyones parents.   \n\n\nStill- NTA", "Girl you need to cut this dead weight. You are being manipulated, gaslit and deserve better. I know you may love him but you need to do whats best for YOU", "A-fucking-men"]}
