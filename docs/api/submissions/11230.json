Not his job, landlord, creditors. No one but you. Are you going to enable him forever? Because he doesn\u2019t have to hustle to have his needs met if he has you doing it for him.

You're living together (probably moved into your place), he doesn't have a reliable income, you're paying all the bills AND you're giving him an allowance to buy weed.

I use THC for anxiety (weed isn\u2019t legal where I am) but mostly because I can\u2019t afford a psychiatrist/medication. I\u2019ve also used weed recreationally since high school. Imo, more than $100 on weed a week is a ridiculous amount and way more than a person would usually need to help with anxiety. Of corse people have different tolerance levels so it\u2019s impossible for me to know how that amount affects him. \n\nIt\u2019s also concerning that he doesn\u2019t want to seek therapy or any other medical treatment. Has he mentioned why he doesn\u2019t want to see a professional? I know I tried therapy before I was ready and it didn\u2019t stick but if he\u2019s medicating himself that heavily I would think that he\u2019d recognize he needs outside help.

Maybe not smoking constantly will allow him to pick up more clients.", "NTA. If his anxiety is that bad then he can see a Psychiatrist and get actual medication for WAY cheaper with health insurance.", "I feel like I\u2019m being taken advantage of. He refuses to get a better job. He loves being a personal trainer but he only made $15000 for the year. I asked him to get a different job for right now and do training on the side but he says I\u2019m being materialistic. I worry about his weed habit but he says he will never quit.", "NTA.

Seriously why are you with this guy?", "NTA but he needs to take a tolerance break. The more you smoke, the more you need.

Tell him to cut back or stop for a period before you even consider loaning him another penny.", "You don\u2019t owe him anything for this, he is self \u201cmedicating\u201d and refusing actual professional help. \nAlso $70 2-3 times a week is insane.

Weed can help with anxiety but can and is done by smoking a much much less amount. \nSmoking that much to cope with anxiety isn\u2019t  medicating, it\u2019s using weed to avoid actually confronting his problems (whether that be anxiety or more). This is coming from someone who did exactly this for years.", "holy shit, if this isn't fake, you need a reality check. your \"boyfriend\" barely even makes enough money to pay for his own weed.\n\n70x2.5 = $175\n\n175x 2 weeks = $350 in 2 weeks on wee\n\n350/500 = .7 = **70%**\n\nyour \"boyfriend\" spends **70%** of his income on weed and you don't see a problem?\n\nNTA, ask him if you can borrow 300 after his paycheck comes in then break up", "NTA.

What are you getting out of it?", "NTA, but an enabler. Get out now.", "On the top end, he's spending $210 a week on weed ($70 x 3)\n\nThat's a potential $840 a month in weed costs; nearly a grand a month and I saw in a comment that he brought in $15,000 last year.\n\nIt's not sustainable to theoretically spend 67.2% of his yearly income on weed.\n\nAs a daily smoker myself, I can almost guarantee that half of his anxiety comes from simply just not smoking. I laugh at the people who say weed isn't addictive or that it doesn't have any addictive qualities - I'm not delusional about the fact that I get anxious and irritable if I go without smoking for more than a day or two, so stop kidding yourself.\n\nNTA - if it really is an anxiety issue then he needs to talk to a professional instead of spending all of his money self-medicating.", "NTA and this is coming from someone who uses weed to medicate and also smokes just about as much as he does. I get it when I can afford to spend the money. If I have a bad paycheck, or especially if I need some financial assistance from family or friends for whatever reason, the first thing to go is the weed. Bills always come first. \nHim saying he doesn't want to try therapy is also a huge red flag.", "NTA. If he can't support his habit then he can't have it. \n\nTherapy is the correct course here, you don't have to pay for his smoking...or his therapy, btw.  This is all on him.  If he chooses to not seek help, you may want to rethink your relationship. He's already tapped you as a financial source, these kinds of situations only devolve.", "NTA. The huge red flag here is that he does have other options to help with his anxiety and just doesn\u2019t want to do it. I\u2019m a smoker and had a financial problem last year, I usually would smoke vape but since it was becoming to expensive for me to continue with that I\u2019ve changed to organic tabaco since it\u2019s cheaper where I live. I know that I\u2019m an addict and I should\u2019ve tried to stop completely but I compromised with my situation. Maybe if he isn\u2019t keen to therapy, try talk to him about cutting back his usage.", "NTA. Often times, when a doctor prescribes a patient a SSRI for anxiety  they say they also recommend therapy along with it because recovery happens from both medication and therapy. Your boyfriend needs therapy to deal with his anxiety. He will need more and more weed to get high if he continues smoking at this volume and the anxiety will continue to get worse.", "NTA - He is not your child who deserves an allowance.  He's a grown ass man and a stoner who can't manage to take care of himself and is wasting money on weed.  Cut him off and frankly you are being an AH to yourself to continue this relationship.", "NTA. You need a new boyfriend, you have different goals.", "He rejects therapy and want to smoke weed he can't afford. On top of that, he's basically leeching off you. That does not sound like someone you could build a like with.\n\nTrust me - the more you fork out, the more he will become entitled to your money, with his hand out every month going forward. \n\nNTA but I think you would be the AH if you didn't nip this in the bud.", "NTA If he has inconsistent paychecks coming in, is borrowing money, refuses to cut back, and doesn't want to go to therapy to try and help him with his anxiety, then maybe you could decide you don't want to be his personal bank anymore.", "So he's making $250 per week and spending $140-210 per week on weed? I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to rethink his budgeting. Sounds like he is living way beyond his means and you are enabling that by covering his expenses so he can blow all his money on weed (I'm a daily smoker btw). I don't think you're TA but I would be thinking long and hard about your role in this relationship if I were you.", "NTA.  If he doesn't want to the right help himself, it's not your job to help him financially.", "NTA. This isn't a boyfriend, this is a sugar baby.", "YTA for allowing yourself to be used as an ATM. Also, he must stink really badly of weed, smoking that often. No way would I want a personal trainer who stinks of weed to be giving me any sort of advice on what to be doing with my body/workouts when clearly they don\u2019t respect their own body. No wonder he is earning so little, he can\u2019t have many clients. I\u2019m not even going to go down the route of pointing out that you\u2019re a health care professional. Grow a spine OP.", " NTA but definitely a ATM!", "NTA. and stop giving him money. If he doesn't have enough to pay his bills, that's on him. You're enabling his habit that you don't like, so you need to shop and let him figure it out.", "NTA.\n\nIf not for your concern for his anxiety and general naivette, I'd actually call you an asshole for enabling his addiction.\n\nHe smokes way too heavily.\n\nSure weed has medical use, but for medical purpose it needs to be prescribed by actual physician.", "NTA. That's a LOT to be spending on weed!", "NTA- Person who uses medical cannabis here and I personally know how expensive it can be, especially in my area where they only allowed 3 dispensaries within the city. I have my card for legitimate reasons, but my bills come first. The weed does help me get by in life, but it is not a substitute for life. In life we still have responsibilities, we still have jobs to do and bills to pay. It isn't fair on you that his weed habit- and at this point it is definitely a habit if not a dependancy- is effecting your finances because he can't keep up with his own. There are cheaper ways to get longer use out of medical cannabis. For example, I swapped from flower and pre-rolls to edibles and vapes. a 1 gram vape lasts me about 2 weeks compared to what I used to burn through with the same amount in flower and pre-rolls. Edibles too, get some that are high enough in THC and you can divide up the gummy or whatever over the course of several days given how long the effects last. I have anxiety, I have depression, I have chronic pain, issues sleeping, and a lot of different reasons for having my med card... But I learned how to budget my life with my 'medicine', and your boyfriend needs to do the same. Protect yourself, protect your finances, and if he's not willing to change his ways, seek the help he clearly needs, or take some measures to cut back on cost then you might need to think about what's best for you and what you want in the future. Also, he is gaslighting you a bit; attaching his medical situation to his dependency on weed. Cut him off.\n\nQuick Edit: As many others stated, cannabis can also exasperate anxiety without the addition of coping mechanisms that can be learned by a therapist. And for some people with anxiety, like my sibling, they can't use it at all without triggering panic and anxiety attacks.", "NTA tell him to see a psychiatrist to get medication to treat his anxiety (medication that won\u2019t hurt his lungs and as an athlete he should really be concerned about his lungs). What he is 140-210 a week for week? So minimum of $600 a month, and he\u2019s self medicating, not being seen by a doctor.

Dude spends $10k a year on weed and wonders why he is broke.", "You being a nurse should know that taking something that is undiagnosed is not good.

He\u2019s 33 years old and should be able to support himself. He needs another job besides personal trainer. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t want to work out with a personal trainer that is a heavy smoker. That isn\u2019t healthy. It\u2019s also not healthy to self-medicate for anxiety. He needs to see a doctor for actual medicine and possibly a therapist. Please consider where this relationship is going. You two are financially incompatible, and he seems manipulative. Good luck to you.", "Hahahahahahaha NTA.

Your boyfriend is a loser", "Nta, but theres way cheaper medicine for anxiety, right now you are just paying his addiction", "\\> He is a heavy smoker and smokes multiple times a day and gets $70 worth of weed 2-3x a week.\n\nThat sounds like a stoner who is addicted to getting high all day and doing nothing.\n\nCannabis can be great medicine, but it sounds like he's abusing it recreationally and not for medicine.  People who take it for anxiety usually microdose, so they're still functional adults. Or they'll use it more heavily if they're having an episode.  He's just getting stoned all day, every day, and pretty much nothing else.  The only medical use I've heard for the quantity I'm imagining, is with cancer patients. They're either consuming a lot to deal with nausea, or are making concentrated RSO to try and shrink tumors.", "NTA - therapy would be cheaper than a smoking habit that strong, and unlike the smoking, which is more by way of a relief/escape in most instances, therapy might actually help address the causes and manage the anxiety.", "NTA", "NTA - daily medical marijuana used here.
