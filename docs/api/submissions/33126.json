You\u2019re just voicing your opinion, which is a completely fair one. And if it\u2019s going to be a long term thing, then I can see why you\u2019d have concerns. NTA. Your concerns are reasonable, and your feelings should also be taken into account here, since you would have to be living with the sister as well.", "NTA.  Your partner is blackmailing you, emotionally, by telling you that she (re)considering your future together because her sister is her priority.  After five years together and without either having underage children, couples who have been together should be each other's priority.  You, too, would be well advised to reconsider your future together with  your partner because, clearly, you're not her priority.", "NTA. This isn't sister staying on the couch for a few weeks while she gets settled, this is a 4 or more year commitment. \n\nYou're not wrong to vocalize it, you're not wrong to not want it, but know that a real possibility is that this may not work out long term if this is a line neither of you will cross.", "NTA.\n\n>she's even considering our future together based on this saying that her sister is her priority.\n\nIf her sister is her priority, there's not much of a future for you together anyway.", "NAH. It's completely reasonable for you to express your feelings about not wanting to live with your partner's sister, as maintaining the current dynamic in your relationship is important to you, but also consider finding a compromise that respects everyone's needs and priorities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's better for all three of you if she lives in whatever student accommodation is (in the US it could be a college dormitory or off campus student housing) when she comes. If she moves in with the two of you, she's less likely to meet and spend time with other students. She can come to your home as a guest instead of as an instant roommate. If later on, the three of you decide you do want to live together, you can make that change, and maybe get a bigger place.", "NTA. You must have heard that saying \"when people tell you who they are, believe them.\" In this case your SO has said that her sister is her priority.\n\nSo, believe her and make your own plans accordingly. Painful? Yes. Necessary? again I believe so. I wish you the best.", "If she says her sister is her priority, then YOU should be the one rethinking your future together.\n\nNTA.", "NAH.\n\nMaybe the sister can stay for a few weeks while she gets her living situation figured out, like finding a student dorm or an apartment?  Then your partner and her sister could have some time together and your partner would be able to directly help her sister and be reassured that she has decent living arrangements.  You'd need to make sure that it would only be a few weeks and not \"Well, we didn't find a 200 square meter apartment for \u00a3200 per month so I guess she stays here\" deal.", "Be honest otherwise you would be hurting yourself and your gf in the long run if resentments build up.  Good luck", "Good for you for being straightforward about how you feel on this issue.  If you don't feel it is a good idea, then it probably isn't.  Having her sister in town but living in student digs would be good for all of you - the sister could come to you for dinners sometimes, and the sisters could hang out together when they have time.  At the same time, the sister could experience university and make friends with fellow students more easily if living in student accommodations.\n\nTell your partner you are willing to make sure that her sister feels welcome to visit often, but not live with you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nand your reply should be that if she is so committed to not even considering your feelings that she just jumps straight to the I'm-not-sure-we-should-get-married nuke... then perhaps you're not sure that you should get married.\n\nwould a sort of compromise be possible?  such as renting a 3 bedroom apartment?  or a house?", "NTA.  You have conflicting priorities.  But she has told you where you are in the pecking order.  This isn\u2019t even about the sister moving in anymore.  It\u2019s now about using emotional manipulation in order to get what she wants.  No compromise\u2026just a demand that you change your view or she\u2019s probably out.  This should be highly concerning to you.  Having a third person move in is a huge adjustment and she\u2019s not willing to have a discussion about it?  Her way or the highway?  That does not bode well for future issues that will need compromise.  This situation has revealed major fault lines in the relationship.  Some pretty serious conversations should be initiated to determine if the two of you are truly on the same page.", "Yeah, that\u2019s where I\u2019d draw the line. Thats a big statement that requires some big conversations"]}
