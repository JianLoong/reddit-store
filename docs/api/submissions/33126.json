I think it would be great too.\n\nHowever, their idea is for her to move in with us in a 2-bedroom apartment, and I really don't want that.\n\nMe and my partner are really enjoying living together at the moment on our own, and I don't want that dynamic to change as I want our relationship to progress. We've been together for more than five years now, and I feel like moving in with someone else would be a step backwards and would also not really allow me to be as comfortable with my partner on a day-to-day basis.\n\nHer sister would probably struggle to live on her own in the city, but if she's going to be studying, student accommodation would be an affordable option.\n\nI've voiced the fact that I wouldn't be a fan of this for these reasons, and I've been made to feel like I've done something wrong and that I should change my view on it, saying that she's even considering our future together based on this saying that her sister is her priority.\n\nAm I wrong for not wanting this?

I voiced that I didn't want to live with my girlfriend's sister in quite a matter of fact and abrupt way.\n\n2.

You\u2019re just voicing your opinion, which is a completely fair one. And if it\u2019s going to be a long term thing, then I can see why you\u2019d have concerns. NTA. Your concerns are reasonable, and your feelings should also be taken into account here, since you would have to be living with the sister as well.", "NTA.  Your partner is blackmailing you, emotionally, by telling you that she (re)considering your future together because her sister is her priority.  After five years together and without either having underage children, couples who have been together should be each other's priority.  You, too, would be well advised to reconsider your future together with  your partner because, clearly, you're not her priority.", "NTA. This isn't sister staying on the couch for a few weeks while she gets settled, this is a 4 or more year commitment. \n\nYou're not wrong to vocalize it, you're not wrong to not want it, but know that a real possibility is that this may not work out long term if this is a line neither of you will cross.", "NTA.\n\n>she's even considering our future together based on this saying that her sister is her priority.\n\nIf her sister is her priority, there's not much of a future for you together anyway.", "NAH. It's completely reasonable for you to express your feelings about not wanting to live with your partner's sister, as maintaining the current dynamic in your relationship is important to you, but also consider finding a compromise that respects everyone's needs and priorities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
