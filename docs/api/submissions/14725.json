All names are fake for privacy purposes. \n\nI\u2019m a college freshman and I opted to go for a random roommate. I was matched with this girl Donna, and so far we\u2019ve gotten along pretty well. Donna has a boyfriend, Malcolm, who she\u2019s constantly on the phone with from the time she wakes up until the time she goes to sleep. \n\nA few weeks ago, I wanted to go to sleep early since I had an 8 AM midterm the next day. I told Donna this in advance and she said she\u2019d be quiet. I fell asleep at about 9:30. However, at around 1 am, I woke up to the sound of Donna scream-crying\u2014literal screaming, like someone had just died. I immediately got out of bed and went over to her and asked her what was wrong, thinking something horrible had just happened. \n\nIt took me a little bit to get it out of her, but she managed to tell me that Malcolm had just broken up with her over text. I felt awful for her (no one deserves that) and spent a while trying to comfort her, but she wouldn\u2019t calm down at all. She just kept sobbing and sobbing very loudly, which is very understandable since it was my understanding that they had been together for a while. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole though: eventually, it started to get closer to 2:30 AM and Donna still wasn\u2019t calming down. But I needed my sleep since I had a midterm in 5 hours, so I suggested we both just go to sleep and revisit it later. She just looked at me like I was insane and asked if I really expected her to sleep. And then kept crying. I knew it was unlikely she\u2019d calm down any time soon, so I very gently asked her if she could leave the room until she was able to calm down a bit so I could sleep. \n\nAgain, Donna just looked at me like I was crazy and didn\u2019t say anything, just kept crying. I repeated myself (again, being as nice as possible) that she could go to the bathroom or the laundry room to compose herself and come back when she was ready. Finally, she just got up without looking at me and stomped out (still crying) and I just went back to sleep. When I woke up for my midterm, she was back in her bed and sleeping, but since then she\u2019s hardly said a word to me. \n\nTo note, I couldn\u2019t go to a friend\u2019s dorm to spend the night since a) most of my friends live in dorms that are farther away and I don\u2019t want to walk by myself in the city at night and b) I wouldn\u2019t wanna bother them on such short notice. \n\nHowever, I still feel terrible about what happened since she was going through a lot, and I\u2019d really appreciate outside perspectives.", "created_utc": 1681422846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12l75fo/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_leave_the_room/", "score": 7197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah breakups hurt and text is shitty but even so can\u2019t literally be crying for that long with no consideration for anyone else.", "NTA. \n\nIt's the scale of respecting a space and overall importance. \n\nWhat is a bedroom primarily for past midnight?

The thing is, she was probably also keeping your neighbors awake as well. When I was in college, the girl in the room next to ours was probably going through something similar.

It took all of my will to not go over and ask her to at least try a different song! To this day I can't listen to that one.

She has to learn to deal with her feelings, that's part of growing up. \n\nMaybe try to have a moment with her, like going to drink with her and talk about her breakup when you have time.", "NAH. You needed to sleep and she needed to cry. you werent wrong and she was in deep grief at that moment", "NTA.  You stayed up with her for an hour in the middle of the night over her breakup. Breakups suck.  But you two are roommates.  That means you share the room.  You're entitled to sleep for your midterm.  She should figure out a way to keep quiet after an hour of screaming.  Your request was fair.", "Nta. Having roommates is brutal. One of the best days of your life will be when you have enough cash to live on your own. Until then, I recommend having earplugs on hand.", "NTA. I might sound like an AH for saying this but...As someone who has had toxic college roommates who have pulled very similar stunts...be careful OP. There are some important red flags I see.\n\n I don't know the whole situation between her and her boyfriend but it sounds like it wasn't the healthiest of relationships if she was on the phone 24/7... that's controlling and clingy behavior on someone's behalf. Given it's not the first week of freshman year, it's not because they are adjusting being away from each other. That is a huge red flag in any relationship.\n\n Double red flag that she was scream crying loud enough to wake the dead for over an hour. Everyone processes grief and loss in their own way but that is... a lot. To me, it reads as emotionally manipulative and like she maybe intended to wake you up and keep you up...\n\nAll that is to say, be careful if/when you engage with her on the topic. She may not be coming from the best place mentally, and sometimes it is better to tread lightly with an apology until you don't live with the person than trying to argue your point to someone who may not be in a super rational headspace.", "NAH. It\u2019s reasonable that you needed to sleep and it sounds like there was no \u201cgood\u201d way to handle that which could help both of you get what you needed in that moment. But also, I guess I\u2019m a softie cos I\u2019ve been that crying girl, literally unable to control the pure, unfiltered emotion\u2014especially at 18. She saw you comfort her in her extremely distressed state, and then she saw you (unintentionally) dismiss it and tell her to go compose herself somewhere else. No matter how gently you phrased it, from her perspective, that probably seemed cold as hell. Also she could just be embarrassed after-the-fact. It sounds like an a tough situation but similar to break ups, hopefully it\u2019ll get better with time.\n\nMaybe you can try talking to her about it after it some more space. But also as long as you don\u2019t actively try to make each other\u2019s lives harder, not being friends with your roommate doesn\u2019t have to impede too much on your life.", "Not really the asshole. \nBut I really think there is no way around it. You did try your best but I think she may have found it insensitive at that time. I would have just told her I\u2019m going to bed and put some headphones on or some music. Noise cancelling headphones is even better. \n\nI just feel like it\u2019s one of these life events with no right way to deal with it and you just have to suck it up. Well I mean there is a wrong way of doing it, forcing your roommate out of the dorm and locking her out. I mean, you get my point.", "The problem is that the room is shared. She has as much right to grieve her relationship in the privacy of her room as you have to sleep. Neither of you have more claim to the room. As long as she was on her side of the room, you can\u2019t prevent her from crying. Your only option is to go and sleep somewhere else. You are the one who was unhappy with the conditions in the room, thus you are the one who should move.", "Yeah reddit is socially inept. OP is certainly not the AH, but you can still be like \"hey sorry I really needed to sleep, now that the midterm is out of the way you have my attention\".", "Even for a death, it's good manners to let people sleep too. People are terrible at processing emotions when they haven't had proper sleep.", "NTA.\n\nThe scream-crying at that time and for that long just isn\u2019t acceptable.", "Yes bc thats clearly the most traumatic event", "Many of these colleges have rules making it mandatory to live on campus, so it's not like you can avoid sharing.", "Completely agree. My first boyfriend broke up with my and I literally - howled - for hours in the middle of the night. It totally broke me. It actually took me many years to work through the pain of that. Was I too sensitive? Probably. But it\u2019s how I felt.", "I have BPD, can confirm lol", "Yeah I really felt for OP's roommate because this was pretty much my reaction the first time I was broken up with at about the same age. Is it a great way to act? It is not, but it is what some people go through.", "I read a study once that said crying after x amount of time wasn't natural and was somewhat performative/indulgent. I wish I could find it!", "Since they're 18 or 19, she may have not gone through an event that made her react this way before. Having that level of reaction to something for the first time is scary as hell, and seeking help for it is hard. I'm not saying she shouldn't seek help for it, she absolutely should, but there are feasible reasons for why she didn't before now.", "If personally agreeing with OP's decision while also being sympathetic to someone who sounds like they went through a major anxiety attack gives me the label of 'asshole', go ahead and label me.", "It does, for a price!", "Clearly you are forever alone and never had an emotional moment.", "I'm sorry about your dog. Ours had a massive cancerous lump that couldn't be removed due to complications. It was so hard seeing him struggle to walk and get around. We had to make the decision before his quality of life became even worse.", "I mean, why do you want someone in your room when you're masturbating?!!", "Yeah if she was with her BF through high school, getting dumped as a freshman can feel like your whole world just collapsed.", "I've had plenty of emotional moments - both of my parents have died, my boyfriend died of cancer - at no point did I scream cry to gain attention in the middle of the fucking night while sharing a room with someone. OP has nothing to make up to her drama queen roommate who, frankly, needs to grow the hell up. We all get upset at times, but most of us are sufficiently rational to realise that it isn't all about us.", "My daughters both endured this shared bedroom for one year as freshmen. I did too", "\u2665\ufe0f", "Definitely, even the most tragic event you could imagine for most people won't have them non-stop wailing for a straight 90 mins, at some point that usually settles down into a more sombre sadness or shock or whatever.", "There's a difference between an end to a relationship with someone who is still alive and never being able to see or talk to or even know someone is doing well in life (because they aren't, they're dead).", "I had to share a room for my first term at a UK university because they were oversubscribed. Most people sharing managed to get their own room before the end of the first term.", "I like having people watch.", "I\u2019ve slept in dorms during hikes and it is ok temporarily but no privacy for weeks/ months or even years?! That sounds quite horrible", "I'm so sorry for your loss. That sounds like it must have been so tough.", "No they carefully omitted that, I suspect it would make them look bad if they told us", "Unless I'm watching Boromir dying, I can't cry for more than a few minutes without getting exhausted and giving up!", "Seriously, you get tired pretty fast when you're full-on sobbing.", "Didn't cry that much in a single stretch for any immediate family death. And I cry easily.", "My first thought at reading 1 1/2 hours of crying/screaming was she must have some issue she needs to discuss with her GP or a therapist or a psychiatrist. Not to shame needing to cry that long at all, but it's just so far out of the ordinary I'd see it as a warning sign that there was something else going on needing to be addressed.", "I also think\u2026 she\u2019s a college freshman. This could very well be her first real heartbreak, which is an experience that makes a lot of people feel really hard, for a really long time. The first time I got my heart broken, I really did just sob uncontrollably for long periods of time. I feel for OP in this situation, and I think the roommate should have been considerate, but I don\u2019t think we have enough information to call this a performance.", "She went to her room to cry. It is HER room too. She has the right to go to her room when she\u2019s upset. She has the right to cry in her room. That\u2019s literally her home. You\u2019re suggesting that she should have left the privacy of her home to go and cry in public so she would be seen as LESS performative. OP could have pooped in some earplugs or popped on some headphones and gone right back to sleep if they wanted to. They chose to share a living space. If they wanted a silent envoy they should have opted for living alone.", "Sometimes people get themselves caught in a weird emotional loop", "It's a shared dorm room ffs. This is not your sibling, this is a stranger that is forced to live with you (at least in freshman year) they shouldn't be forced to put headphones on just so they can sleep. \n\nMost colleges don't let you live alone freshman year unless you pay a lot of extra cash or have special accommodations. Also there's a difference between simply crying and screaming and sobbing loudly at 1 in the goddamn morning the night before a big exam. Also if they have headphones on they could miss their alarm??? On the day of an exam. Hello? \n\nY'all in the comments saying op should just suffer and let the roommate do whatever she wants with no care for op or the other people on the floor (bc dorm room walls are thin) would be horrible roommates stg"]}
