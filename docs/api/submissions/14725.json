All names are fake for privacy purposes. \n\nI\u2019m a college freshman and I opted to go for a random roommate. I was matched with this girl Donna, and so far we\u2019ve gotten along pretty well. Donna has a boyfriend, Malcolm, who she\u2019s constantly on the phone with from the time she wakes up until the time she goes to sleep. \n\nA few weeks ago, I wanted to go to sleep early since I had an 8 AM midterm the next day. I told Donna this in advance and she said she\u2019d be quiet. I fell asleep at about 9:30. However, at around 1 am, I woke up to the sound of Donna scream-crying\u2014literal screaming, like someone had just died. I immediately got out of bed and went over to her and asked her what was wrong, thinking something horrible had just happened. \n\nIt took me a little bit to get it out of her, but she managed to tell me that Malcolm had just broken up with her over text. I felt awful for her (no one deserves that) and spent a while trying to comfort her, but she wouldn\u2019t calm down at all. She just kept sobbing and sobbing very loudly, which is very understandable since it was my understanding that they had been together for a while. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole though: eventually, it started to get closer to 2:30 AM and Donna still wasn\u2019t calming down. But I needed my sleep since I had a midterm in 5 hours, so I suggested we both just go to sleep and revisit it later. She just looked at me like I was insane and asked if I really expected her to sleep. And then kept crying. I knew it was unlikely she\u2019d calm down any time soon, so I very gently asked her if she could leave the room until she was able to calm down a bit so I could sleep. \n\nAgain, Donna just looked at me like I was crazy and didn\u2019t say anything, just kept crying. I repeated myself (again, being as nice as possible) that she could go to the bathroom or the laundry room to compose herself and come back when she was ready. Finally, she just got up without looking at me and stomped out (still crying) and I just went back to sleep. When I woke up for my midterm, she was back in her bed and sleeping, but since then she\u2019s hardly said a word to me. \n\nTo note, I couldn\u2019t go to a friend\u2019s dorm to spend the night since a) most of my friends live in dorms that are farther away and I don\u2019t want to walk by myself in the city at night and b) I wouldn\u2019t wanna bother them on such short notice. \n\nHowever, I still feel terrible about what happened since she was going through a lot, and I\u2019d really appreciate outside perspectives.", "created_utc": 1681422846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12l75fo/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_leave_the_room/", "score": 2284, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The thing is, she was probably also keeping your neighbors awake as well. When I was in college, the girl in the room next to ours was probably going through something similar.

It took all of my will to not go over and ask her to at least try a different song! To this day I can't listen to that one.

It took another two months to fully breakup but I was a mess the whole time. \n\nI not only didn\u2019t scream cry at Jesus-H-Christ in the morning during the eve of Midterms, I dealt with my shit (mainly by banging it out with a pretty goth boy) far away from the room. I did my worst ugly crying when my roomie had classes and when she came in I would chill myself out. I wasn\u2019t great at it because she would ask if I was *sure* I was okay, but it\u2019s really not that hard to be really, super sad and avoid making it anyone else\u2019s problem. \n\nAll thing\u2019s said, you were very kind.

It's her living space too and signing up for shared college living space kinda inevitably means situations like this.  Not everyone grieves the same and she's grieving the loss of a relationship and probably looking for a little attention and comfort from the human closest to her.  Nevermind she's probably a bit homesick as well and possibly worn from schoolwork.  I remember times when things like that all built up and it just took something to set me off.  I lived by myself as much as possible after freshman year though, so it was just just my kitty girl to comfort me.\n\nETA: I'm also assuming both of you are 18\\19 or so, and the emotional maturity isn't fully there, especially depending on how spoiled the 'emerging adult' was at home (new term I recently discovered when looking for socializing groups).", "That wasn't crying.

Yes, it\u2019s cheaper to share a room, but I had a roommate who would have sex with her boyfriend while I was trying to sleep, and then asked if that boyfriend could spend the night after I found out my grandma had died earlier that day.
