All names are fake for privacy purposes. \n\nI\u2019m a college freshman and I opted to go for a random roommate. I was matched with this girl Donna, and so far we\u2019ve gotten along pretty well. Donna has a boyfriend, Malcolm, who she\u2019s constantly on the phone with from the time she wakes up until the time she goes to sleep. \n\nA few weeks ago, I wanted to go to sleep early since I had an 8 AM midterm the next day. I told Donna this in advance and she said she\u2019d be quiet. I fell asleep at about 9:30. However, at around 1 am, I woke up to the sound of Donna scream-crying\u2014literal screaming, like someone had just died. I immediately got out of bed and went over to her and asked her what was wrong, thinking something horrible had just happened. \n\nIt took me a little bit to get it out of her, but she managed to tell me that Malcolm had just broken up with her over text. I felt awful for her (no one deserves that) and spent a while trying to comfort her, but she wouldn\u2019t calm down at all. She just kept sobbing and sobbing very loudly, which is very understandable since it was my understanding that they had been together for a while. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole though: eventually, it started to get closer to 2:30 AM and Donna still wasn\u2019t calming down. But I needed my sleep since I had a midterm in 5 hours, so I suggested we both just go to sleep and revisit it later. She just looked at me like I was insane and asked if I really expected her to sleep. And then kept crying. I knew it was unlikely she\u2019d calm down any time soon, so I very gently asked her if she could leave the room until she was able to calm down a bit so I could sleep. \n\nAgain, Donna just looked at me like I was crazy and didn\u2019t say anything, just kept crying. I repeated myself (again, being as nice as possible) that she could go to the bathroom or the laundry room to compose herself and come back when she was ready. Finally, she just got up without looking at me and stomped out (still crying) and I just went back to sleep. When I woke up for my midterm, she was back in her bed and sleeping, but since then she\u2019s hardly said a word to me. \n\nTo note, I couldn\u2019t go to a friend\u2019s dorm to spend the night since a) most of my friends live in dorms that are farther away and I don\u2019t want to walk by myself in the city at night and b) I wouldn\u2019t wanna bother them on such short notice. \n\nHowever, I still feel terrible about what happened since she was going through a lot, and I\u2019d really appreciate outside perspectives.", "created_utc": 1681422846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12l75fo/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_leave_the_room/", "score": 660, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The thing is, she was probably also keeping your neighbors awake as well. When I was in college, the girl in the room next to ours was probably going through something similar.

It took all of my will to not go over and ask her to at least try a different song! To this day I can't listen to that one.

That's what I would do? If you are being loud (crying loudly, talking on the phone, watching something without headphones) then you should leave the shared sleeping space if someone is sleeping. That is common courtesy where I'm from.  It's rude and kind of entitled to take sleep away from someone who has their own obligations the next day. \n\n\nJust the other night I had a random panic attack and didn't want to wake up my husband who had to work in a couple of hours. (he would have been fine comforting me, but this was my choice) and went to the bathroom to cry and have my little breakdown. And that's my own husband! I would never stay in a room with a sleeping roommate while having a loud cry like that especially for so long.", "Lol people who scream cry are deranged entitled attention seekers. No wonder this dude dumped this loser via text hahaha.", "That sounds heartbreaking for sure. Sorry you had to go through that .I too have experienced some aweful heartbreaks and tea definitely didn\u2019t fix it. But neither does scream crying in the arms of a dorm-room buddy/stranger and keeping them up all night."]}
