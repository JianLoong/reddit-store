{"id": 14725, "submission_id": "12l75fo", "title": "AITA for asking my roommate to leave the room while crying over her breakup with her boyfriend so I could sleep?", "selftext": "Sorry for the new account, my roommate knows my main. All names are fake for privacy purposes. \n\nI\u2019m a college freshman and I opted to go for a random roommate. I was matched with this girl Donna, and so far we\u2019ve gotten along pretty well. Donna has a boyfriend, Malcolm, who she\u2019s constantly on the phone with from the time she wakes up until the time she goes to sleep. \n\nA few weeks ago, I wanted to go to sleep early since I had an 8 AM midterm the next day. I told Donna this in advance and she said she\u2019d be quiet. I fell asleep at about 9:30. However, at around 1 am, I woke up to the sound of Donna scream-crying\u2014literal screaming, like someone had just died. I immediately got out of bed and went over to her and asked her what was wrong, thinking something horrible had just happened. \n\nIt took me a little bit to get it out of her, but she managed to tell me that Malcolm had just broken up with her over text. I felt awful for her (no one deserves that) and spent a while trying to comfort her, but she wouldn\u2019t calm down at all. She just kept sobbing and sobbing very loudly, which is very understandable since it was my understanding that they had been together for a while. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole though: eventually, it started to get closer to 2:30 AM and Donna still wasn\u2019t calming down. But I needed my sleep since I had a midterm in 5 hours, so I suggested we both just go to sleep and revisit it later. She just looked at me like I was insane and asked if I really expected her to sleep. And then kept crying. I knew it was unlikely she\u2019d calm down any time soon, so I very gently asked her if she could leave the room until she was able to calm down a bit so I could sleep. \n\nAgain, Donna just looked at me like I was crazy and didn\u2019t say anything, just kept crying. I repeated myself (again, being as nice as possible) that she could go to the bathroom or the laundry room to compose herself and come back when she was ready. Finally, she just got up without looking at me and stomped out (still crying) and I just went back to sleep. When I woke up for my midterm, she was back in her bed and sleeping, but since then she\u2019s hardly said a word to me. \n\nTo note, I couldn\u2019t go to a friend\u2019s dorm to spend the night since a) most of my friends live in dorms that are farther away and I don\u2019t want to walk by myself in the city at night and b) I wouldn\u2019t wanna bother them on such short notice. \n\nHowever, I still feel terrible about what happened since she was going through a lot, and I\u2019d really appreciate outside perspectives.", "created_utc": 1681422846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12l75fo/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_leave_the_room/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s a breakup - not a death (I assume you would have reacted differently if it was more serious). \n\nShe refused to try to go to sleep (or just be quiet) and continued making a ruckus. You needed to sleep for your test. Asking her to leave was completely reasonable.", "NTA. Yeah breakups hurt and text is shitty but even so can\u2019t literally be crying for that long with no consideration for anyone else.", "NTA. \n\nIt's the scale of respecting a space and overall importance. \n\nWhat is a bedroom primarily for past midnight? Sleeping. Therefore, your need for sleep takes priority over loud crying.\n\nWhat's more important, some dude whose name she won't remember in a few years or doing well for higher education you have to pay for? I mean, come on that one's obvious.\n\nNo, I think you did what you could for over an hour and she didn't respect your shared space enough to take her banshee wailing elsewhere. She's entirely the AH here.", "It sounds like you handled this as best as you could - let her cry for a while, tried to support, realized she wasn't calming down, suggested you both go to sleep, then mentioned your upcoming exam/needs.  I get that it was a bit insensitive, but I also get that you didn't really have another option.  \n\nShe's not in a great place right now, so I wouldn't take her response too hard.  I'd say it's definitely worth talking about if you want to better the relationship!  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. She'll probably drop out anyway if she spends all of her time on him and not actually doing work like she's supposed to. You had a priority over her situation. Not your fault, no need to feel bad.", "NTA. Who scream cry\u2019s and expects to be babied like that? You were more than considerate. Honestly once I found out she wasn\u2019t dying I\u2019d have tried to go right back to sleep.", "NTA Your studies are your priority, especially given the cost of higher education. No one should expect others to be emotionally invested in them, long term boyfriend or not. You're a roommate but acted as a friend getting out of bed for an hour and checking in later on", "NTA. Your studies are the #1 priority and there's an understanding that you need to be respectful of your roommate and their schedule when living in a shared dorm room, so she has no right to disrupt your sleep all night when you have an early class or midterm.\n\nI feel for her and breakups suck but you're young and life will go on.", "NTA, you have exams and she can worry about her ex in the morning.", "NTA you really tried.", "You're NTA.  She has a right to be upset,  heartbroken, etc. But she was inconsiderate to scream and carry on like an infant. The world does not stop to cater to her drama.", "NTA, you did what you could and needed to sleep, she was probably too upset to see how selfish she was being. I hope your exam went alright anyway \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA", "NTA - did your best to comfort her over an hour, and she already knew that you had a test in the morning and she did not care to try to compose herself at all or give you any consideration at all even after you were kind enough to try to console her", "I'd say NAH. She may be avoiding you out of embarrassment or out of passive aggressiveness, you won't be able to tell without bringing it up. She was understandably upset, but you had an understandable reason for needing your sleep and you gave her safe alternatives as suggestions (bathroom and laundry room). In terms of why she gave you those looks, she likely wasn't thinking straight due to the breakup emotions, but that doesn't make her an AH.", "NTA. God, I don't miss roommates. I recommend Squishies earplugs - they look like little blue lozenges that you squish into your ears like magic silly putty. Blessed silence.", "NTA. The thing is, she was probably also keeping your neighbors awake as well. When I was in college, the girl in the room next to ours was probably going through something similar. She was crying loudly and kept playing one song at full volume over and over for hours-the walls were cinder blocks and we could still hear everything. It took all of my will to not go over and ask her to at least try a different song! To this day I can't listen to that one. I didn't even have an exam the next day but by morning I was still frazzled from all of the drama. Hopefully you two can smooth things over.", "NTA Most people can cry without much noise. Especially after one fucking hour. Somehome it seems for me, as if she was especially loud to get attention. You don't cry bwahaha like in a bad tv series. \n\nYou had an important exam. The excuse \"sorry, my roommate had a break up\" won't work.", "NTA her persistent crying suggests drama queen to me and she expected you to pretty much stay up all night despite her knowing you had exams the next day.\n\nIn fact, you were woken by her \"scream crying \". That was appallingly rude, selfish and attention seeking. \n\nAdditionally,  she sounds very needy and clingy. You say she was non-stop on the phone to her boyfriend.  No wonder he dumped her. Time for you to too. Get another roomate.", "NAH.  Roomate life.", "NTA - She's a drama queen.", "YTA. It's her room too. Invest in noise cancelling headphones or play some music to go to sleep. Roommates are going to be loud. That's the struggle of living in the same room in a dorm. It's ridiculous of you to request that she leave the room when she is obviously having an emotional break down.", "YTA. \n\n> I asked her what was wrong, thinking something horrible had just happened.\n\nIt did.  And instead of putting on your noise canceling headphones and eye mask and dealing with college roommate issues like a big girl, you tried to kick a girl out of her own room when she was having a crisis situation in the middle of the night.", "YTA\n\nCrying is an involuntary response. She pays rent too. Use earplugs.", "ESH. Screaming in the middle of the night over a breakup is ridiculous.
