We visited my grandma frequently and she cooked us a meal every time, and we explained the intolerance to her clearly, but she still never cooked anything for me, I ate rice by itself or similar meals.\r  \nShe doesn't have memory issues, so she just didn't want to make extra work for herself by making a different dish or altering the one she already planned for us. I didn't say anything, because I hate conflicts, and I didn't mind going home hungry if I got to spend time with my family. Every time before we left, my mother told my grandma in a calm way that what she did was disrespectful and made me sad. \r  \nLater my aunt, her son and husband moved in with my grandmother. She worked for the dairy industry and had friends whose children have food allergies, so she is quite educated on lactose intolerance. When they moved in, her and my grandma did the cooking 50/50, but nothing changed for me, they still didn't make anything for me.\r  \nOne day, when this had gone on for several years, by mother had enough, called my grandmother, threatening her that she would never see me again if she didn't prepare me at least one dish the next time we visit. I didn't know of this phone call and thought they realised they should care about me enough to cook me something I could eat. After this point, I always had something to eat.\r  \nIn 2020, I went vegan, telling them ahead of time.\r  \nMy aunt\u2019s family moved to a different, but when we visit, they still make the meal 50/50. Making vegan foods doesn\u2019t cost them more, because they don't buy me \"special\" vegan substitutes, they just make the same meal without animal products (I don't expect them to, just saying that my diet doesn't affect their finances).\r  \nOne Christmas my grandma comes to our house and the other she goes to theirs and on the 25th, the other side of the family visits the house grandma stayed at and we prepare a tasty holiday feast. Last time when it was our turn to celebrate with grandma, my mother (not vegan), decided to make a plant-based feast for the family. Everyone said that it was good. \r  \nNow I know how to cook and I see how much my mother works during the holidays, so I decided to do it all, so she could relax. I can\u2019t cook meat and don\u2019t want to. When my aunt heard that there won\u2019t be any meat on the table at the family gathering, she got angry at me, and said that I am selfish because I\u2019m the only vegan in the family. I asked her children and grandma if they had problems with a vegan meal, they don't. She says that satisfying guests is her priority and doesn\u2019t get why she can\u2019t get the same attention back. I feel like it\u2019s rude to criticise my Christmas menu almost 20 days before Christmas and also complain about the food when I still have no idea what I\u2019ll make. Her oldest son keeps sending me vegan recipes, excited about a vegan Christmas. I don't like seeing people eating dead animals, so it would be a Christmas gift for me.

Yes, all people *can* eat vegan food - but it's not just about what you can eat, but what about you *want* to eat at a celebratory family meal. Probably it depends how much you enjoy food and how much it's about basic sustenance versus flavour.\n\nIf it were me and I'd known going to X relative's house meant our Christmas dinner was going to be entirely vegan, I'd do everything within the limits of politeness to try and make it so we went to a different relative's for Christmas dinner.

We visited my grandma frequently and she cooked us a meal every time, and we explained the intolerance to her clearly, but she still never cooked anything for me, I ate rice by itself or similar meals.\r  \nShe doesn't have memory issues, so she just didn't want to make extra work for herself by making a different dish or altering the one she already planned for us. I didn't say anything, because I hate conflicts, and I didn't mind going home hungry if I got to spend time with my family. Every time before we left, my mother told my grandma in a calm way that what she did was disrespectful and made me sad. \r  \nLater my aunt, her son and husband moved in with my grandmother. She worked for the dairy industry and had friends whose children have food allergies, so she is quite educated on lactose intolerance. When they moved in, her and my grandma did the cooking 50/50, but nothing changed for me, they still didn't make anything for me.\r  \nOne day, when this had gone on for several years, by mother had enough, called my grandmother, threatening her that she would never see me again if she didn't prepare me at least one dish the next time we visit. I didn't know of this phone call and thought they realised they should care about me enough to cook me something I could eat. After this point, I always had something to eat.\r  \nIn 2020, I went vegan, telling them ahead of time.\r  \nMy aunt\u2019s family moved to a different, but when we visit, they still make the meal 50/50. Making vegan foods doesn\u2019t cost them more, because they don't buy me \"special\" vegan substitutes, they just make the same meal without animal products (I don't expect them to, just saying that my diet doesn't affect their finances).\r  \nOne Christmas my grandma comes to our house and the other she goes to theirs and on the 25th, the other side of the family visits the house grandma stayed at and we prepare a tasty holiday feast. Last time when it was our turn to celebrate with grandma, my mother (not vegan), decided to make a plant-based feast for the family. Everyone said that it was good. \r  \nNow I know how to cook and I see how much my mother works during the holidays, so I decided to do it all, so she could relax. I can\u2019t cook meat and don\u2019t want to. When my aunt heard that there won\u2019t be any meat on the table at the family gathering, she got angry at me, and said that I am selfish because I\u2019m the only vegan in the family. I asked her children and grandma if they had problems with a vegan meal, they don't. She says that satisfying guests is her priority and doesn\u2019t get why she can\u2019t get the same attention back. I feel like it\u2019s rude to criticise my Christmas menu almost 20 days before Christmas and also complain about the food when I still have no idea what I\u2019ll make. Her oldest son keeps sending me vegan recipes, excited about a vegan Christmas. I don't like seeing people eating dead animals, so it would be a Christmas gift for me.

The answer is if you invite someone you care about to your home for a meal make an effort to have something they can actually eat- just like OP couldn\u2019t eat food with dairy as a kid and prefers vegan food now he would appreciate some consideration.   And FYI vegan food works for folks who are halal or kosher.", "I agree it's not the same, but if someone wants to have a real turkey for the holidays or whatever...it isn't difficult to just let them bring their own. \n\nI don't eat pork, but I allow family and friends to eat it around me, to bring it to suppers if they want, etc. I get that veganism and not eating pork aren't exactly the same, but I do find it a tad ridiculous when people refuse to allow others to also eat their preferences around them.", "I must encourage checking youtube for \"Carrot Juice Is Murder\" by The Arrogant Worms.\n\nYou're welcome!", "Yeah no kidding. If someone makes me fake fried chicken and then you know they are going to bring it up that you ate fake chicken, I\u2019m gonna be mad as hell.", "Agreed. Vegan fried chicken tastes nothing like chicken and frankly it\u2019s pretty awful for any one who isn\u2019t a vegan. Also an entire meal being vegan for a holiday sounds awful to me. I could live with vegetarian but vegan alternatives to butter and cheese are hideous tasting.", "I\u2019m vegan, I consider it a preference.

A bit of common sense!\n\nOP, you cook, so you decide, and OF COURSE your grandma and aunt are AHs for the way they behaved all these years! HOWEVER, this is \"AITA\" and if you go all vegan KNOWING that part of your family does not appreciate it, then yta as well,because no-one forces you to cook and if it's just for your mum you could ask your guest to bring some additional meat-based dishes if they want.\n\nBut most of all, this is a gathering of family at Christmas! Not your own present! And what is it? A present to make the others unhappy about the dinner so you can have it ONLY your way? Don't say that this is not a revenge! Be honest and present it for what it is!", "I also love \"everyone can eat vegan\". Lol, no, not everyone for an entire meal.

I don\u2019t believe they are all very convincing about it though and that OP is willfully taking what they say at face value.

So if you had one bad burger, would you never eat burgers again? And as is, I doubt it was just one time you ate vegan food, because that would mean otherwise, every meal in your life has had some animal product somewhere in it.

Its a huge category of food.", "You know that meat is dead animals right", "but that\u2019s exactly what meat is,,, dead animals. They also were in charge of the meal.

Pasta with tomato sauce? Potatoes and other vegetables with herbs from the oven? Rice with vegetables? No?

Yeah, your parents were the AH in that instance", "It is parents responsibility to ensure the kid has stuff to eat even when not in home. Parents should have some food for you with them, full stop.

You could make a chicken paprikas with that.", "The Hungarian cuisine is very meat-heavy. I find it quite challenging to imagine making it appealing in a vegan way.

And pickle loaf!!!", "Being forced to eat olive loaf at daycare is one of my worst childhood memories.

I do know what they eat there.", "When you go over to other people's homes do you leave your dirty shoes on when they ask you to remove them? Do you  sit on their sofa and watch porn on your phone? Do you blow your nose on their bath towels? Do you complain when they don't serve shrimp scampi because you can't live without your favorite food for one meal?

I'm simply using OP's own framing of who is at fault for ruining Christmas. If OP feels she is ruining Christmas by serving 100% vegan, that's just how she feels. \n\nShe can't change how other people react, so she's focusing on what she can control, which is to change up her menu. I get why she's thinking that way. It is often easier for us to just suck it up rather than just accept that these people don't love you the same way you love them. \n\nI agree that it would help OP to reframe the situation to what you described, for her own sake. \n\nI only initially commented because I can see grandma's side, because my husband and I did all the Thanksgiving food for our families this year. So I am acutely aware of how much work goes into cooking, and how difficult it is to just use unfamiliar substitutions right before an important meal. I also really hate cooking with dairy substitutes, they break way too easily, and do not thicken properly. It's really insulting to tell grandma that her way of cooking is wrong, when she's the one preparing the whole meal. Similar to how it's really insulting to OP to insist she change the menu when she is doing 100% of the cooking."]}
