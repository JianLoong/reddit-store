Bc my dog isn't neglected.\n\nFast forward to me calling the cops to have this guy brought in on criminal harassment. They gave him a warning and he hasn't said shit to me since, because he was criminally harassing me. Which is what you're doing now.\n\nONE BIG THING IM NOTICING IN BOTH THESE SITUATIONS- is you pretend to care so much, but are willing to call the authorities who take dogs and inevitably have to kill them. Willing to have that dog locked in a cage before it's untimely death. Bc that's what's better than a dog who doesn't get walked? That's better than having to see dog poop in someone else's property. \n\nGet stuffed YTA. Like a giant flaming AH", "I'm having this exact same issue with my neighbor (I am the dog owner) I have medical reasons I can't walk her often, and I clean up the poop every couple of days, she's happy, she's healthy, and she was never good on a leash anyways, even when I was healthy. YET he called the management company a half dozen times since he moved in back in Sept. Even they have told him to mind his business. \n\nYTA - walks are good for some, but not good for others. And some dogs also have issues (like hip issues etc) where walks can cause serious medical problems.", "YTA. You *should* feel like the AH because that\u2019s what you\u2019re being.", "YTA, dogs shit everywhere, that doesn't mean the dog is being neglected, get a hobbie or something and stop meddling in other people's lives", "YTA. In my eyes, mainly due to starting off so rudely/intensely. You should have started more neutrally/politely, it may have gone more your way in that case too.", "[removed]", "YTA", "I think you're a major asshole. Leave that poor lady alone. Jesus. What's wrong with you?", "YTA. Mind your own business. My dogs loves walks but my current street is extremely narrow without side streets to escape down and he's extremely leash reactive to other dogs, so I don't take him on regular walks. He has a patio and yard to run around in instead, which was a priority for me when I was moving. If a neighbor called animal control because they thought I wasn't taking him on enough walks I'd be extremely irritated.", "YTA how unbelievably rude.", "You can\u2019t be serious. Of course YTA. Not only is the dog pooping in HER YARD, but she\u2019s also picking it up. I work with dogs. I\u2019ve seen true neglect and abuse and this ain\u2019t it. Mind your own business.", "YTA. A bit intrusive. That animal services just ignored you and walked off should be a sign.", "YTA. If animal control doesn\u2019t think their is an issue, what is it that makes you so certain that there is? Why do you feel so entitled to your neighbors personal information that you not only asked a third party to disclose it to you, but you called her and demanded she give you the information.", "YTA - if a dog has a yard to play in, they don't necessarily need a walk. And it sounds like your big problem is that the dog shits in its own yard? And she cleans it up, so I don't see what the hell your problem is.", "Maybe she has hidden illnesses. Maybe she is pregnant and her partner takes the dog. Maybe it's just none of your effing business. The dog is cleaned up after. I don't take my dog out, my husband does it when he gets home because I'm now disabled. Doesn't mean I don't care for my dog. The world would be a happier place if people just stopped interfering in others business", "YTA\n\nDogs going potty in the backyard is completely normal and expected. Depending on where you live, walking the dog in the neighborhood could be more dangerous (esp w/r/t oncoming traffic).  \n\n\nAnd seriously, animal control? It's not like this dog is being aggressive or unfriendly.", "YTA it\u2019s her property! Most people who have dogs actively seek out fenced yards so they don\u2019t have to walk them all the time. You don\u2019t sound like you know anything about dogs. And why didn\u2019t you back down once animal control confirmed everything was ok? At this point, it\u2019s almost harassment", "YTA - Mind your own beeswax.", "YTA & a fucking weird one at that \ud83d\ude02", "This post has to be a joke right?", "YTA.  Mind your own damn business.  The dog was shitting in it's own yard and she does pick up after it.   You'd rather she go let it shit in other people's yards?  How about your yard, is that a good yard to shit in?", "YTA. So new dog that is still adjusting to its home and you want her out in public? She's probably training it.  It will take some time to adjust to the correct training", "YTA big YTA - the dog is being loved, it\u2019s got food, shelter and is being taken outside to shit in ITS OWN YARD. You have no idea what your neighbour is doing - she could take the dog to the park in her car. Not to mention, she cleans up the shit in her OWN YARD. It was none of your business and you wasted animal controls time.", "YTA.\n\nOP, I don't think what you're smelling is dog shit. I think your head is just too far up your own ass that you can't tell the difference.", "YTA. This is a bit crazy and I hope fake. One thing is who would ever call animal control because someone let their dog out to go to the bathroom in their own backyard? Do you also call the police on fast Food workers when they give you a cold fries? Also How do you know your neighbor doesn\u2019t walk the dogs are you creeping on your neighbor 24/7? I have personally walked my dogs anywhere from anywhere as early as like 5am to as late as midnight Depending on my work schedule. Of course animal control wouldn\u2019t do anything because they are actually abusing their animal like beating them or leaving them locked up in a cage with no food or water for days at a time or something.", "YTA.", "My dog is traumatized and when her PTSD is bad, I've been actively told by dog behaviorists that only under unavoidable situations should I force her on a walk (ie vet appointment, actual emergency, etc)\n\nYTA and mind your own damn business", "We don\u2019t walk our dogs. We live on an acre and they have an electric fence. The older one is 12 now. Has had 2 ACL surgeries. He can\u2019t really do the steps anymore and has a hard time walking. He would make it a couple steps on a walk and then not be able to anymore. So when he needs to go out he just let him out and when he wants to come back he comes back. The younger one goes on walks sometimes but he enjoys running into the woods and chasing the deer. That\u2019s enough exercise. Not all dogs should be and need to be going on walks.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It is the first thing she wants to do after a walk. She is a very submissive dog and the vet said it was an anxiety thing.  Honestly I'm pretty happy with it. I don't have to carry poop bags around while enjoying a walk.", "I have one that absolutely will not under any circumstances do any business on a leash, no matter how long you walk her if she is in the yard with a leash she won\u2019t do her business until the leash is removed. I\u2019m lucky I have a yard for her to use.", "You're welcome.  We don't walk the cows (on purpose, things happen, lol) but we did have a newborn calf escape the fence (a million times).  Luckily,  they aren't very fast their first day, so he was easily caught.  By my 15 year old.  Who used him as a prop for her social media pictures.  Adorable,  yes.  Enjoyable,  not to the momma or bull.  They were very angry.  Lol.", "This is awesome.  I love farm life", "We used to raise them. We'd take them out when they were babies and dress them up and play with them like dolls.  The neighbors used to complain because apparently 2 or 3 little girls walking a giant hat wearing hog around was unnerving.  Dad told them that as long as we stayed on the property,  to kiss off and told us that of we must walk the pigs, to always put them on a leash when we left the property.  He even got us leashes for them.  Because he hated the neighbors and still enables us to do silly stuff.   \n\nMy current project is to convince the 2000 lb bull that hats are our friends and that he would look dapper in a Santa hat.  I'm using snack cakes as bribes.  So far, hats are not our friends, the bull hates red, dad told my husband to make sure the life insurance was updated, and zebra cakes are the bull's favorite", "Same... Now.\n\nWhen we first moved into our house she had to learn it was okay to pee in the yard. She only wanted to pee on walks. We bought the dang house so we wouldn't have to walk her to let her pee all the dang time! Lol", "Mama cows are not to be messed with!!!", "Awww, I\u2019d pay good money to see \u201cSanta Bull\u201d! We had an oversized 4-H Hereford steer that was basically Ferdinand and let the kids put hats and scarves on him. We called him \u201cTank\u201d and were very sad to see him get on the trailer after the fair.", "They are not.  I do because they know me and I'm slightly stupid and have no fear, but I do respect them and talk to them the whole time.  Which is why they let me pet the babies.  That and I'm the bringer of the feed, they like that.  Lol. \n\nOne of ours had her baby about a year ago and when I went to check because I heard a calf that wasn't there 30 minutes prior, she nudged the baby to me like she was a gift.  We talked and decided to keep that one.  I say we, I mean I said we are keeping her even if she has to live in the house.", "This boy is a big love.  People swear he's going to be my end, but he's such a baby.  I wasn't all that into making him a pet because \"we don't make pets out of 2000 lb male breeding animals.\" But, I was eating oatmeal cookies one day at my parents and feeding pieces to the babies because, well, they're cute, and he slowly walked up and, if a 2000 lb bull could beg, he did.  So, I gave him a cookie.  Or 4.   And now, I give him treats every time I'm at my parents (we keep the babies and expectant mommas here and we wean the babies here, but the bull and cows to be bred are at my parents to reduce the stress of weaning since they can't see or hear each other),  and hecomes running like a giant dog. It's our thing.  And has turned into a running joke after pictures got posted."]}
