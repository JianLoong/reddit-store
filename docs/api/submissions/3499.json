Unless she\u2019s literally fixated on her neighbour\u2019s front door from dawn to dusk?", "That's a lot of assumptions for the neighbour. Neither you nor op know why the neighbour doesn't take the dog on walks. Neighbour can't even know if the dog is being taken on walks. The dog could be going on 5-6 walks per day and op wouldn't know. Unless op is stalking their neighbour 24/7 and has installed a camera somewhere in their neighbours house they can't know what they do for certain. Also there's many reasons that a dog might not go for a walk. And if animal services inspected the situation and said the owner had a good reason of not taking the dog for walks then I'd trust animal services and their search over what op is saying. The dog could be having medical or aggression issues which could make it hard to be out on walks. We don't know the whys and hows so unless the neighbor let's their dog do their thing on op's side of the property then op had no reason getting involved. You also said you doubt neighbour has a big garden. How do you know? Your entire comment is just an assumption on how the neighbour lives, how big their garden is etc. Animal control said there's a good reason. That's where all of this should've ended.", "They're not doing it from a good place or concern for the dog, they just don't like the smell of poop.", "Mine literally waits to get home, kinda like some people. It's almost like that's where they feel most comfortable? So strange", "It would be one thing if the neighbor wasnt picking up after the dog and letting the smell linger, but the neighbor picks it up", "Unless it's super hot in the summer or they never clean up, you really wouldn't notice a smell unless the dog is pooping by their window.", "Agreed. We don\u2019t know the age, breed, temperament, physical health, etc. of this dog. We don\u2019t know the factors.\n\nIf it\u2019s an adolescent husky, yes, that dog needs all of the exercise and then some, for example.\n\nIf it\u2019s a 10 year old Great Dane with arthritis, not so much. Hell, if it\u2019s a Great Dane puppy, you have to be very careful about the amount and intensity of exercise they get or you\u2019ll fuck them up for life.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
