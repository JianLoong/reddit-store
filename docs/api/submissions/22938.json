If that many students are struggling, it\u2019s likely not them", "NTA \nIf that many student fails\u2026 I would stop to reflect a little bit about MY teaching methods. Also I don\u2019t see why you are an AH in her mind for not jointing in her insult fest about people you never met.", "NTA. If only 21 students out 118 passed, she might want to look in the mirror. What do these 118 people have in common? Her.....It's not your job to blow smoke up her ass. Back rubs, yes....but not delusional bullshit.", "INFO:\n\nWhy does your wife feel she needs someone in her corner?\n\nMy initial thought was, so, you should have done what, picked a name at random, hoped the name matched that of a poorly performing student, and commented on how lazy this imaginary (to you) student was?\n\nAre you a professor, or teacher, too? If you aren't, how can you possibly comment on the standard of students these days. But, even if you are, unless you teach the same subject how can you comment on the standards of students of a particular subject. N T A\n\nAnd since she's surprised with the outcome, that suggests the results of the final exams were not on a par with expected grades.\n\nBut then it hit my what your wife said she wanted: someone in her corner. Does this mean that she's in a position where her contract, or the interest from students in having her as tutor, could be in jeopardy due to the low pass rate? Does your wife feel she needs your support because she's afraid of suggestions, or just the implication, she's a bad tutor, not supportive, something which provides an alternative explanation to the students not applying themselves properly.", "NTA. \n\nAsk your wife if she puts any emotion into her teaching or if she just stands up there and talks like a robot. 21 out of 118 means she had classes full of dopes or she isn\u2019t doing a good job covering the material.", "NTA \n\nBut I would be way more concerned with her teaching and that many FAILING! That is way more concerning than who these students are. She has a job to teach them and SHE FAILED! 97 students to be exact. Smfh", "NTA but she is.  She wants 'support' because not even one in five of her students passed.  She failed her own exam and she knows it.  Bad teaching is happening in her classes.", "NTA, why do some professors almost brag about how difficult their class is to pass? I\u2019d be horrified if that many students failed my class because it\u2019d be a reflection on my ability to teach", "NTA.\n\nNo. Partners should not always support each other, sometimes the best thing is to bring them back to reality, other times it's good to just let them vent. Think you made the best choice here, but I would probably follow up with saying you are not in her corner here, this a rant as old as time, and its honestly quite tiring to hear it all the time. A teaching professor ought to be more aware.", "NTA. But it should be obvious why you kept quiet and rubbed her shoulders instead of matching her energy. \n\nIf she needs validation as to why she\u2019s not happy with the current student body she\u2019s been tasked with teaching then perhaps she should look at ways of encouraging them to be more enthusiastic about the subject matter they signed up for. \n\nLooking to you for validation of her vitriol says more about her state of mind as a professor than her willingness to challenge her students to be the best they can be while under her tutelage.", "NTA\n\nAnd as many others have pointed out, that many failures says way more about her ability to teach than it does about \u201ckids these days\u201d.", "Nta but with that many students failing she is probably a really poor professor.  I work in a university and honestly that's a very low passing rate.", "NTA. International law is boring and difficult enough without the teacher demoralising everyone by failing them.. if only 21 out of 118 passed, then I think the teacher\u2019s doing something wrong.", "Lol NTA. How could you go on about the students, you don't know them?", "NTA. It\u2019s her job to teach them, so their failure is a direct reflection on her poor teaching ability. Seems like she realizes this, is insecure about it and is deflecting the blame on everyone else, including her students and even her supportive partner. That should be a cause for concern.", "NTA\n\nYour point is valid, you don't know her students nor do you know what they're like. You did the right thing by listening to her and comforting her. If you weren't comfortable commenting on strangers you don't know, that's perfectly fine and she needs to accept that.", "NTA\n\nIf only that little students pass her class, she's clearly not very good at teaching the subject though.", "NTA. Honestly, it sounds like you're being very supportive already! I wouldn't have opined on the \"lazy students\" if only because you don't know them well enough to say anything accurate about their (supposed) laziness.", "NTA.\n\nAs other pointed out if only 21 out  of 118 passed she is the problem. I did International Law, and yes as many pointed out it is a really difficult subject that sometimes people need to retake even when they studied. \n\nHowever, in my class the rate is usually at least 70% pass mostly because our teacher did find a way to make it understandable, using many examples and going back on the most difficult parts many times.", "You can be there for her when she loses her job.  The school will fire her if she fails 80% of the students. NTA.  You are a little bit the ah because you didn\u2019t bring that up to her.", "I\u2019d say with a fail rate like that she\u2019s the problem. NTA though I wouldn\u2019t of gotten involved either", "nta, you weren't being unsupportive, you just didn't give a definite opinion. i find it odd that her idea of someone in her corner is having her partner shit on her students. she does realise it's not her vs. her students, and that there are no \"corners\"... right?\n\nit's also v questionable that only 18% of her class is passing. should that not be a testament to her teaching?", "NTA You don\u2019t know them and it would be insincere and weirdly dishonest for you to talk shit about them. Saw others say that she is likely not great at her job if so many are failing and I agree. \n\nBeing supportive should not ask us to personally behave in ways that compromise our ethics, morals, or autonomy. Those are called boundaries. Good comportment and accountability keeps life smoother in a chaotic universe if you want to be an absolute pragmatist about it.", "Is this a particularly poor quality cohort of students that also does poorly on other subjects? Or is this just the product of poor teaching?\n\nEither way, you're NTA.", "NTA\n\nI teach too and would never be mad at my partner for not being condescending about my students?\n\nYou made her coffee and gave her a massage. If that isn't you being in her corner then I don't know what is", "We all like to hear someone confirm what we are thinking ( one of the reasons for being a Redditor!) but youre NTA,you did as much as you could be expected to do. Nor can we say yr wife is,as we have no way of knowing if its the students\u2019 faults or hers.", "If you\u2019re a professor and that many of your students fail, you\u2019re probably not a great teacher. NTA", "NTA first off, but law school has extreme curves so that technically no one ever actually fails. Well, I'm sure people do full on fail but my husband's law school through all the years an average test score was 60. Now, other law schools might be different but it was my understanding when he talked about it that it was common across all law schools.", "Omg your wife sounds like an awful teacher!! Has she ever considered the reason only 21 students passed was because she did a truly terrible job at teaching?!! And then she bashes those students to someone else, not being concerned or compassionate towards them?!! It\u2019s unfortunate that people like your wife are teachers. NTA", "NTA.  With so few passing the exam, I don\u2019t know if the subject is that hard, the students are that lazy/stupid, or if she\u2019s just bad at the teaching part of her job.", "NTA. sounds like she\u2019s a bad prof. if 97 of her students are failing, that\u2019s fully on her", "Nta.maybe your wife's just a shitty teacher", "NTA. So, if someone started bad-mouthing her, should you agree with them?", "shes asking you to comment on the students, instead of the obvious....which she is aware of.  That she wasnt an effective teacher to almost 100 of her students.  This is an opportunity for her to look at ways she can be more effective and making changes to her teaching methods.  This would be the mark of a good teacher.  She should be doing that throughout the term to check in on her students.  those teacher evaluations will be going out to the entire class and I bet the ones that respond will say the same thing.", "NTA. Ask her what the common denominator is among all her students. (Don\u2019t actually, but yeah she sounds like a bad professor)", "I think she feels guilty that she\u2019s possibly failed her students, and wants you to agree with her that it\u2019s the students\u2019 fault to assuage her guilt.", "NAH.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong and had valid points. But I have teachers in the family and education in general is a mess (at least in most western countries) so I don't blame your wife either for feeling emotionally exhausted and (maybe unfairly) unsupported.\n\nCan you say things like 'that sounds really difficult' 'I can't imagine how challenging and frustrating it would be with the effort I know you put into lessons' etc?", "\u201cSo, you want to feel me\u2026 in your corner. Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\n\nReport back with results.", "NTA\n\nYou are not an expert in the subject matter, you do not know the test, you do not know any of her students.  I would say that you were supportive in an appropriate manner.  I wonder if your wife is worried about the other possible explanation for such a low passing rate - inadequate instruction.  Usually students this far into their education are performing well in school.  Her position may be in jeopardy over this.", "NTA  It may be that alot of students thought it was going to be much easier than it actually was. Your wife shouldn't ask you to agree with something that she said about a bunch of people that you didn't know. You were there to support her and by being there for her when she needed to vent her frustrations. She should be thankful she has a partner who cares enough to do that.", "NTA. Why is she taking their failing so personally?  If they didn't work, that's their fault. If they fail and blame her that's different but that hasn't happened.", "YTA because we\u2019re supposed to believe a professor so demanding they fail 80% of their class would be with someone that uses grammar like \u201cshould I have WENT\u201d nope this story is BS", "YTA telling Redditt your wife is a bad professor..    kinda find it hard to believe that a university would allow that kind of fail rate.", "A very small YTA here. I don't think you needed to join her in condemning the students, but it would have been helpful to draw her out and encourage her to understand what happened. Just saying \"it's going to be OK\" is not very supportive, especially if she is a good teacher who's trying to deal with the fallout of what looks to be a complete disaster.\n\nAll of you \"NTA, she must be a horrible teacher\" folks, there is not enough information here to tell. If she teaches in a traditional way in a law school, she has probably been teaching the same course in the same way for a while and knows what results to expect. Some law faculty teach all term and then the students' grades are based on one final exam. If you just do what you've been doing and present an exam that's really similar to what you've always presented, and almost the whole class fails, that is going to be really devastating to you if you are a good teacher. Plus she will likely have to have conversations with the higher ups if she holds to these grades. \n\nDespite the vibe here, most faculty members don't enjoy failing their students. It's hella upsetting if you care about your work. And the reality is that some law schools are scrambling to maintain enrollments so they may be admitting students who aren't as prepared. In a situation like this, she may have been having a wrenching internal dialogue over what was the right thing to do: give them the grades they earned or institute a curve and pass a bunch of people who didn't show even the most basic mastery of the material? It's a professional degree and some of these people may want to go on to practice in that field.
