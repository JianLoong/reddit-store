I need one too every once in a while. When she made the plans she said she was going camping with a girlfriend after wine tasting during the day (today). She mentioned the general area they\u2019d be camping and when she\u2019d be home. Cool, no big deal. So I hear from her this morning via text and then nothing again from her until 9:00pm. No check ins or anything. I thought this was strange. After she texts me I asked how the day was, etc., and she mentions they were staying at some house that one of the other people in the group had setup and is very far away from where she said they\u2019d be camping. I tried very hard to not be annoyed by this, but I responded by saying that it would have been nice for her to let me know in case of an emergency.   I also mentioned that it annoys me that she doesn\u2019t check in when she goes on these kinds of trips. She responded that she was with a group of people as an invited guest and that she was just going with the flow and that she always has her phone in case of an emergency. I told her that was all fine and good, but that if I couldn\u2019t get a hold of her I\u2019d have no idea where to look or where I could let someone know (like police or rescue) to look. I could tell immediately that she thinks I am crazy for wanting this information and I imagine she\u2019ll come back tomorrow saying that I\u2019m trying to control her. For the record, I don\u2019t care that she needs time to herself away from me and our kids, but not checking in and not telling me where she is staying seems discourteous. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\nEdit: Wow, quite a spirited dialogue has ensued following my post. I never would have expected such a response with a variety of responses. Thanks to all who took the time to respond, positively or negatively. There\u2019s always something to glean from feedback regardless of whether it\u2019s in my favor or not. So thank you. \n\nA couple points of clarification:\n\n1. I have not been texting my wife non-stop since she\u2019s been gone. In fact, I purposely was not texting her to let her enjoy the space. I reached out this morning for the first time to say good morning. She initiated both of the texts yesterday. \n2. At no time was I demanding to know her exact location. We don\u2019t use the person locator features on our phones. \n3. My concerns were based on safety first and foremost. I love my wife and want her to be well always. Knowing her whereabouts gives me comfort should anything happen. \n4. Her change of plans took her pretty far away from the general area she said she and her friend would be camping. The house was apparently down a miles long dirt road in an area that I am not familiar with. \n5. My wife and her friends were wine tasting all day and I was concerned about how they were getting from point a to point b. \n\nCheers to all!", "created_utc": 1682838891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133igab/aita_for_wanting_to_know_where_my_wife_is_staying/", "score": 1759, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It has nothing to do with whether you trust her or not, you just want to make sure she's safe.\n\n And also maybe come to an agreement with when to check-in just so you know she's ok or even when you are the one that's away. So maybe a good morning and a goodnight or just a goodnight. Or Maybe at breakfast, lunch, and dinner check-in.

One of the first times he traveled we had situations similar to this: where he just fell off the grid for a whole day/evening and I got super anxious and worried (his parents did as well). He was initially resistive when we finally spoke and I explained to him that while I *fully* support his need for alone time and solo travel, he also cannot just expect the people who love him to not freak out if he disappears for more than a day - and the desire to know where he is and to check in is not controlling or unreasonable.

When we go away from each other for a weekend or holiday with friends we explicitly agree to not really text each other loads or we end up not really getting a bit of space from each other and it\u2019s more enjoyable to hear the other person\u2019s stories when they get home. But we have an agreement that (internet permitting) we always text each other goodnight (except for the most recent trip she had where I also went to go stay with a friend whose partner was also away to help watch their 5mo and 4yo so she could keep working and managed to just pass out straight on to my phone exhausted before I managed to message my wife 3 out of the 7 nights!) and then usually a morning text outlining the rough plans for the day and a check out and check in if moving locations (like cities etc not just back home from the restaurant kinda thing) to let the other know we got there safely. \n\nI personally don\u2019t necessarily find it super weird that she didn\u2019t update him when the plans changed because sometimes you really do just get caught up in going with the flow, although she ideally would have and definitely should have accepted she was in the wrong about that if he was upset. But the thing I find the weirdest bit is it doesn\u2019t even sound like she volunteered the info straight away, she only mentioned it when he asked if she\u2019d had a good day at 9pm.

Strange how her story changed. Somehow I think the wife is a little shady in her actions.Hubby is certainly not controlling as he would have never have agreed to her little trip away.", "I\u2019m with you on that being the same kind of boundaries me and my wife have when away from each other (always good night and generally morning with I\u2019m heading out now, here are my very loose plans for the day) but when moving locations (like full destination changes, not each little thing in the day) we do check out/ins with each other to each other internet permitting to let each other know we got there ok. \n\nBecause she\u2019s really not giving any consideration to her safety here.

It\u2019s not controlling it\u2019s courtesy.", "You\u2019re NTA first of all she left to go on a trip and wouldn\u2019t give him and exact location only a general location so he has Bassicly no idea where she\u2019s at in that general space then she changed locations and refused to tell him and op wanted to know that his wife was safe and he wanted to know her location for safety reason but my overall interpretation of this is that OPs wife is cheating and he doesn\u2019t know and just want to make sure that she\u2019s safe", "NTA. It\u2019s sketchy that she won\u2019t be clear on where she is staying. I didn\u2019t get the impression OP was overbearing at all.", "NTA\n\nShe's getting dicked down though.", "I might be biased in saying NTA. If I were to head off somewhere or end up MIA for any reason I'd atleast let my girlfriend know so she's not worrying for my safety or worried I'm up to anything stupid. I prefer to be transparent with her so she doesn't have to be concerned for any reason and I'm pretty sure if I told her \"Hey I'm at some other persons house and have been for a while\" she'd have some understandable concerns.", "you don't people your plans have changed after the fact though? If she encountered an issue in the interval between her plans changing and her texting her husband at 9 PM, then the husband would be lacking important information about her whereabouts.", "My husband knows I worry. He lets me know if he is stopping at the store.  Also in case I want anything.  A partnership is a partnership. Be considerate!  And with texting is reallly not hard!!!", "Least stereotypical AITA commenter", "man, why do so many people go missing in the woods when, they can just call? car accident? victim of a crime? just call! why bother telling people where you're going when you can just tell them where you went after the fact?", "I\u2019d be worried, about myself.  I want my husband to know where I am in case of all sorts of emergencies.  Including my camping emergency.  I\u2019m also convinced if we take care of those details, it means no emergency will happen. So, doubly important.", "My hubby has my phone password and has a fingerprint programmed into my phone. I have a fingerprint programmed into his because I can never remember the pattern he traces to unlock his phone (it's like he's summoning demons), but that's because someone has to delete my browsing history \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "I got the feeling like she was cheating on him. Doubt that her friend was with her.", "Yup. So many times I've seen commenters use anecdote as a thinly veiled excuse to make assumptions.\n\n\"You told your girlfriend to wear a seatbelt in the car? My ex boyfriend also said the same to me. He was also an abusive narcissist. YTA because you sound like my ex and that makes you abusive.\"\n\n\\-this sub usually"]}
