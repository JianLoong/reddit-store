So maybe a good morning and a goodnight or just a goodnight. Or Maybe at breakfast, lunch, and dinner check-in.

Seeing different location and reaching even a minute earlier with help can save a life.", "It concerns me that in your examples you mention 2 examples of children but don't see how infantilizing it is to expect an adult to check in MORE than multiple times a day.", "My husband lets me know if he stops at the grocery store on the way home, so I don\u2019t worry he\u2019s been in an accident when he\u2019s late. Telling the person you picked to spend the rest of your life with where you\u2019re going to be is a common courtesy\u2026.", "Yes, but accidents happen? I'd assume as a mother she would want to be contactable if her kid were to end up in hospital or something. \n\nIn my family when traveling its always been a rule to let at least one person know where you're going to be and when you're expected back in case something happens and no one can contact you. \n\nFor example, we recently had a cyclone where I live and all communication (mobile and wifi) down one side of the country was completely cut off for days and whole cities were blocked off by closed roads. Plenty of people had to contact emergency services and civil defense with the last known locations of loved ones. I can't imagine not having any idea of my partners last known location in that situation.", "She got frustrated after you berated her for not replying your texts. \n\nSo its more like she is tired of the conversation than not wanting to let you know. \n\nPerhaps, you could consider why she wanted to be left alone. Is she really exhausted (mentally and emotionally) from taking care of the family?", "That's overkill. Most people can be away from their spouses without checking in 3 times a day including a FaceTime.", "You go on a trip to be by yourself to constantly call home? Why?", "Three times a day? Seriously?", "Calm down mate. She\u2019s away with friends for the weekend. It\u2019s not the end of the world", "Not really, he'd say the whole she went camping w/ friends, they stayed at a house semi near \\_\\_\\_\\_ from what she told me, and they can get cell phone tower pings and such.", "She didn\u2019t go missing. She literally told him, just later than HE wanted", "All the people she's with know her exact location. Stop watching crime drama on tv.", "As soon as she knew where she was staying etc she could have let him know, then said, Don't contact her again unless there's an emergency.\" It would have saved all the messages and questions", "Yes what if they did. What if they had to take a detour and ended up on the next road over? Are they supposed to text each time the GPS updates with a faster route? If not, your comment makes no sense. Even knowing the \"general area\" isn't gonna help being a minute faster.", "Agreed. It honestly feels like it's a bunch of single people projecting", "She has her cell phone. He knows her phone number. Obviously he can contact her if an emergency occurs. \n\nHe is upset that she was enjoying her day and didn't text him enough times. He needs to leave her alone to enjoy her time away.\n\nThe chances of a disaster occurring are slim. And if there was one, everyone would figure it out.", "Yes, 2/3 are just a simple text like \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d or \u201chow are the kids?\u201d But maybe I need to check in less and enjoy me-time!", "It is common courtesy to tell your SO where you\u2019re staying though. \u201cHey, we\u2019re staying at X Campground off Route 30,\u201d or \u201cHey, we decided to stay at Janice\u2019s house. Here\u2019s the address.\u201d", "It's not the end of the world but not knowing where your spouse is can be worrisome, especially if they aren't where they said they would be. It's not a big deal to be off with friends for a weekend but you still have people at home who want to make sure you're ok.", "The house is far from the campsite and he only found out about the house after asking. Which was my point, had he not asked he wouldn't have known. Once a phones battery dies, you can't ping it.\n\nAnd still doesn't know where the house is or who she is with. So he would still respond: I don't know. \n\nAlso many people vanish without a trace with their cellphones on them.", "let\u2019s put it in a different context. i am pregnant with a man\u2019s child. i don\u2019t tell the man until i\u2019m giving birth. if something went wrong in that time he couldn\u2019t have saved me because he didn\u2019t know. same situation", "i am watching crime shows because they are elite. but not an address is needed but more a \u201chey change of plans, im staying at a friends place in (town) call if you need anything\u201d that way if something does happen you know the town they were last in", "did I write about texting each time GPS updates? I wrote about keeping location on.", "exactly she has her cell phone, she could just send a text. Op has no problem with her \"enjoying her day\" but is worried, I thought people worry about their family. Does your family not worry about you?", "Slim, but not impossible. It really wouldn't hurt her to send a quick text saying instead of X, I'll be at Y.\n\nThat's what you do with people you love", "I don't know why you're getting downvoted. He can reach her at any time if necessary. He just doesn't have her exact location at all times. I don't see why that's an issue for him. Why does he need to know exactly where she is all the time?", "You should! Or at least you should have a frank conversation about what each of you expect and want. At the moment it seems like your annoyance stems from her not conforming to the unvoiced expectations *you* have. \n\nFacetiming with kiddos before bedtime sounds sweet. The question is do you really need all the additional check-ins/updates especially if your partner has info of where you are staying? Proof of life sort of texts can also be pics of where you are. Like if you/she saw something awesome, why not send a pic with a caption for your partner to chuckle over. But this expectation needs to be voiced.", "Legit does seem a bit much to me, and I am the person who has anxiety issues/used to like to know growing up when my mom was on her way home from work(20 min commute one way) in case of accidents.  \nLike now if I need to reach my hubs when he's out and about/if something is wrong then I'll text/call but if I know he's gonna be gone for an extended stay it's just a small love ya text otherwise and leave him to go about his stuff.", "You do what makes you comfortable, but let her do the same.", "Hey I\u2019m going away for the weekend with friends. Btw I\u2019m an adult and don\u2019t need to constantly check in", "It\u2019s a weekend. One weekend. And you need to know exactly where they are staying every night?", "Where in the story does it say that he only found out after asking?", "That is absolutely not the same situation.", "She tried to send just a text tonight...he responded back with an entire convo.", "Isn\u2019t that what she did?", "I agree about the constantly checking in thing. That\u2019s a matter of personal preference. Some couples check in with each other all throughout the day when not on vacation and others don\u2019t, and I\u2019d say for most people that whatever their norm is carried over to vacation.\n\nI do think where you\u2019re staying should be shared though, and if that changes your SO should be updated, especially if you have children.", "\u2b06\ufe0f This \u2026. she\u2019s a grown adult needing a break\u2026.give her a break. God forbid you didn\u2019t know exactly where your wife was \u2026..we all survived the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s with no ability to constantly check in", "When he is asking her how her day was and associated questions, she mentions that she is at someones house far away from the campsite. \n\nAs far as he knew she was camping until that conversation.", "it\u2019s the same baseline.", "Twice a day is enough.", "That\u2019s not him only finding out because he asked. You are really making leaps here.", "It\u2019s literally nowhere near that.", "OP: How's camp?\n\nWife: Im not camping I am at someones house far from there. \n\nSo he asks about camp/her location, she tells him she isn't there but at somewhere else. No leaps and not even critical thinking, just basic thinking.", "if you can\u2019t see how it\u2019s similar i can\u2019t help", "All it says is he asked how her day was, she volunteered she was staying elsewhere according to his story. You\u2019re making assumptions outside of the text.", "\u201cMy wife didn\u2019t tell me where she was for 8 hours\u201d does not equate to \u201cdidn\u2019t tell the farther of my child he\u2019s the father and now I\u2019m in labor\u201d the leap is comically insane.", "ok i\u2019m making brownies. i haven\u2019t told anyone i\u2019m making brownies and the brownies start a fire. i\u2019ve put myself in danger by not telling anyone what i\u2019ve done. she\u2019s put herself in danger by not telling her husband. yes she told him eventually (like the pregnant woman told the partner eventually) but it should have been sooner"]}
