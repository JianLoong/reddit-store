You don\u2019t say how old your kids are, but they are young enough to have bedtimes. Most children will ask if you\u2019ve heard from mom/dad yet when they are away.

You're not trying to be controlling, and it's fine that she's not checking in every two hours. But when changing location for where she's staying, please let you know. It's a simple text. \n\n2.

Since she\u2019s with friends, I think it\u2019s normal that you weren\u2019t the one checking in / hounding her so as not to possibly interrupt something, and it sounds like you in fact did no such thing.  She\u2019s lacking in both common courtesy, and frankly safety protocol by it letting you know anything.  Not every parent gets to get away like she does, and even you say you do, good on you both for affording the space to get away, but she needs to acknowledge the people she left behind.

Like commenter said, give it a few days before saying anything. \n\nWhen you do decide to bring it up just let her know how it made you worried not knowing exactly where she was and that the only reason you want to know where she is, is in case of an emergency. It has nothing to do with whether you trust her or not, you just want to make sure she's safe.\n\n And also maybe come to an agreement with when to check-in just so you know she's ok or even when you are the one that's away. So maybe a good morning and a goodnight or just a goodnight. Or Maybe at breakfast, lunch, and dinner check-in. Suggest the check-in to be brief, like hey I'm having breakfast now everything has been going great.

One of the first times he traveled we had situations similar to this: where he just fell off the grid for a whole day/evening and I got super anxious and worried (his parents did as well). He was initially resistive when we finally spoke and I explained to him that while I *fully* support his need for alone time and solo travel, he also cannot just expect the people who love him to not freak out if he disappears for more than a day - and the desire to know where he is and to check in is not controlling or unreasonable. He recognized and understood this and apologized.

I've slept basically the whole time though, today is the first where I haven't napped so perfect timing for Monday morning \ud83e\udd72", "If she's in a group then surely between them they can organise rescue, contact him and give him location details and where she will be etc? I just think it's a bit odd that people think a group of people can't between them figure these things out in an emergency should the worst happen.", "Well, we know she told him about it after the first night because it says so.", "Just in time to get back to that grindstone. Glad you're feeling better; being sick is the worst!", "We don't know if she told them about her husband and what if the emergency was a landslide where they got hurt as well.", "The story has sent really clear about that at all.", "Good grief. If you need to tell yourself that, ok then. If there was a landslide, knowing her location would do absolutely zero to change the situation. Because if they're all buried in the middle of nowhere there is no one left to tell him where she is or what happened. Knowing where she is won't change that.", "I guess that's fair, it just seems like the fact that he got a text from her in the morning suggests a night away had already been spent.", "It will because he can let rescue teams know where she was at when they last talk"]}
