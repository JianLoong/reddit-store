Your mom likes rubbing it in when she gets what you want, but the weirdest part here is she won't even let you buy what you want for yourself. Very strange and controlling behavior on her part for a mom.", "NTA. Momma has a control issue.", "NTA.\n\nBut why is your mom acting like an evil stepmom that hates to see her husband\u2019s kid happy?", "NTA. Your mum sounds weird.", "Definitely NTA. In my opinion the mom sounds toxic. It also seems the father is enabling her behavior. Although there could be more to this, maybe childhood problems, this behavior is still unjust. The fact she wont even let you buy food with your own money is almost as upsetting as the rest of it. I feel like she's trying to twist the knife in even more by blatantly telling you about it. The way you feel is very much justified. I hope when you can move on your own one day you can distance yourself from them. Or maybe try talking to her or your father about it. Also reaching out to a family member might be a good option. \n\nTd;lr\nNTA, mother is toxic and dad is only enabling it. Try reaching out to a family member or talking with your parents.", "NTA. My X used to do stuff like this. It's a mind game. Your mom is trying to exercise more control over you. No matter what her \"reasons\" might be, it is toxic and she needs to stop. Since you are not in a position to leave the household yet, you may have to suck it up; but start making your exit plans. She's a mess and won't be cured magically. If she doesn't seek counseling and want to change, she'll keep doing this kind of messed up stuff.", "NTA \nHonestly, it sounds like your mom is abusing you. Once or twice happening to get the food you wanted before might just be coincidence, but refusing to let you get/make your own food is absolutely bizarre parental behavior. Like, I have kids and I'm thrilled any time they want to help with the cooking. Go for it, take some of the workload off my plate. \n\nAnyway, go make yourself some food. You deserve good food!", "run away from your mom as soon as you\u2019re able to", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
