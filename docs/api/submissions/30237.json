The car was worth about 2,000\u20ac, but it had some issues. They offered it to me for 1,000\u20ac and my dad said he would fix it as a graduation gift. I appreciated it but told them I was moving to The Hague, Netherlands, for university and didn't have a place to keep it. They said I could store it in their garage until I found a rental space, so I bought it.\n\nFast forward to September, my parents' car got totaled in an accident. Thankfully, everyone was okay. Afterwards, they started using my car for everything, which I didn't mind (after all they helped me out a lot) but they could have at least asked.\n\nJump ahead to a week ago when I went back to Slovakia for a visit. My uncle was with us, visiting Slovakia for the first time. I had plans to visit a friend in another city, but I found my dad and uncle in my car, about to leave. I told them I needed the car to get to the city and wished they had asked since it was my car. My dad's response was that he fixed it for me and I should be grateful. I was taken aback but let it go and asked for a ride to the train station at least, which he did.\n\nOn day three, I had a haircut appointment. Just before leaving, my dad took the car to pick up my mom. I told him it was my car and I needed it right away, but he said he'd be quick and drove off, making me late for my appointment.\n\nOn the fourth day, I wanted to go to the farmers' market. My parents were heading to a different town with my uncle and said they needed the car. They suggested I take a taxi and a train to meet them. My grandma told them it was my car, but my dad insisted he fixed it and I should be grateful. We argued, but in the end, I took my car.\n\nWhen it was time to go back to university, I took my car keys with me and left the car parked in front of my grandma's house (who lives right next door to my parents).

I understand that your dad repaired the car, so if he asks to use it and it doesn't inconvenience you, I can see why you would let him drive it.

You bought it, right? You paid for it; that makes it yours. The agreement wasn\u2019t it\u2019s yours except when family needs it.

I doubt that.\n\nThe excuse of \u201cI fixed it up, you should be grateful\u201d is just that: an excuse. It\u2019s just convenient for them to use it so they\u2019re pulling the parent card on you and trying to act like they\u2019re in the right. They\u2019re the AHs.
