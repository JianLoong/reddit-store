I got super angry because it was just not a new & pricey appliance but that no one in my house told me about it.

There was no reason to think that putting her knee on the fridge liner would crack it; my fridge would be able to take that, but my fridge is 15 years old, and they were made stronger then. \n\n Your reaction could have been \u201cI cannot believe they used such flimsy materials to make this fridge!\u201d But instead you have decided to be enraged with your wife, because you have a story going on in your head that she doesn\u2019t take care of your things \u2013 I say \u201cyour things\u201c because you said \u201c why should *I* buy nice things\u201d, as if your wife did not contribute, as if everything in the house belongs only to you  -  and you\u2019ve decided to add this to that story.  \n\nHow is the damage your family pets did to the couch her exclusive fault?

Of course with this I'm running with the assumption that the kids and her spend most time in her car vs yours.   The Crack was an accident. She didn't take a hammer to it.  And leather with pets is a bad idea.   Your reaction makes me wonder if that's partly why she didn't tell you about it.  This also seems to be about so much more.  I think you guys need help and then maybe you can stay together,  but if it were me, I'd leave you.", "YTA", "YTA. Your wife wasn't trying to do something silly, she was trying to remove packing tape. Your level of anger and ultimatum in response to an accidental damage is utterly disproportionate. Your examples of the couch and car also seem like part of everyday wear and tear in a household with pets children.  \n  \nYou remind me of my abusive ex who would get so angry with mishaps household tasks (meat that wasn't cooked tender enough, shirts that I forgot to unbutton the collars on before washing, washing up put to dry \"the wrong way\") that I became paralysed with fear.

But I've done my fair share, more than! I ruined the floor last year all by myself! Our new fridge got a dent in it within days, too. My parents used to blow a stack if anything got damaged, and so my instinct is to do the same (learned behaviour). I fight it though. It's really hard but I have to keep telling myself they are only \"things\". It does us no good to get so upset. \n\nYou're NTA for me, YET, because this stuff really bites, but you will be if you don't chill, apologise if you yelled, and talk out with your wife why she didn't want to tell you. Good luck.", "you seem to value your fridge more than your wife. breaking a plastic liner is not an inexcusable offense & certainly not worth all your emotional ire. \n\nso what's really going on? YTA", "ESH: It sucks she did not reveal that to you when it first happened. But I think that is due to your rather angry reactions. It definitely sucks to have happened. \nSince the fridge is so new, could you use the warranty or contact who you bought it from and say \"hey we noticed this\" /\"maybe it happened in transit?\" And get it replaced or repaired? \n\nFor the couch thing. I get it is frustrating. My cat destroyed a couch and made my wife pissed. So when we got a new couch I bought a large four foot tall heavy duty scratching post to keep next to the couch. Couches are great for cats to scratch, it gives satisfaction, good on the nails, and they can do a large stretching action with it. Hence why you would want a very tall and heavy post = it's more enticing than the couch. One year in, still not a scratch on the couch. So look into that next round. \n\nI am very non materialistic and my wife is always in heavy angst of \"why can't we have nice things\". so I can understand that dynamic with your spouse. I think some communication and acknowledgment that accidents indeed do happen, and you are not each other's enemies is always a good reminder. \n\nSorry it happened. It sucks. But it could always be worse. She could have climbed in and it fell on her and then you had a broken fridge and an ER visit, kind of thing. So, take a moment of gratitude for that. And if it still work, sure sucks to look at, but works. Than yay!", "You feel how you feel. Feelings are not wrong unless they are obsessive to the level of interfering with what you want to accomplish.\n\nI understand your frustration. I agree that you should not buy nice things right now if it will stress you out if anything happens to these things. Maybe if from now on you had only \"reasonably acceptable\" instead of \"nice\", it would be less upsetting as things become damaged. \n\nIn exchange for you being less reactive to things becoming damaged, perhaps your family can work with you to try to take better care of things? This was an accident and I could see it happening that way from myself. However, your children can be learning to be careful and how to care for things so in the future it can become part of their normal behavior. Part of growing up should include an understanding about treating things with respect and being financially responsible because replacing things unnecessarily costs money. I don't know about training the cats. They probably will never learn how much leather couches cost.\n\nNAH", "Wife sounds like an idiot. I\u2019d dump her.", "I had the same thought.
