If you make a complaint to HR via email (cc'ed to your personal account and your boss) that Bill has been stealing from you mentioning that section and that this institutes a hostile work environment, their options drop to firing Bill or risking you suing the company.

But I recommend taking a read to help prepare any responses and really hammer home that your food was NOT boobytrapped because you like it that hot.", "Holy shit, dude.

Perfect /pettyrevenge, you should post it there. How does he know to target your lunch specifically?", "Yeah don't put laxatives in food. You can kill people like that.

Hopefully he learns his lesson.", "NTA\n\nYou don't get sick from peppers unless you literally can't eat peppers at all for some specific health reason.  Capsaicin makes your body think it's burning, but it is quite literally not burning, it doesn't cause stomach ulcers like some people seem to believe and they're actually quite good for you. He was perfectly fine and just felt discomfort, that's not the same as making him ill. It doesn't take much to build up tolerance either.\n\nAs an amusing aside, there's a place near me that lets you pick your heat level for certain dishes and it's got 4 levels, I can't remember the second one, but the first is 'white' the third is 'indian' and the highest one is 'thai'. I always get a chuckle out of it and then order the thai option, much to the concern and confusion of the staff since I look like a pathetic sheet of paper.", "NTA\n\nWTF is your girlfriend's problem?", "NTA but I'll qualify that by saying that your only nta if you would have eaten that food with the spice level you made it,  y w b t a if you did it simply as bait to screw with him, but if you were gonna eat it despite spiking it extra hot then that's fine", "NTA. Bill fucked around and found out.", "This sounds like an ask the manager question that was asked a while ago.", "NTA. You intended to eat your own lunch. The fact that the stolen lunch didn't agree with him is his own problem. I'm glad HR is siding with you on this.", "NTA.

I've never had my lunch stolen but I've had my soda stolen.  I really needed that caffeine.", "You'd only be the AH if you added something in that you weren't going to eat. Laxatives for instance, as that would be literal food poisoning.\n\nAs it is, you made yourself food for yourself, and then he outed himself to HR as the food thief, meaning if your food in the future goes missing there's literal evidence that it can be attributed to Bill as he's admitted he was doing it before (I'd actually like to know if HR punished him for admitting to stealing your food, as if they haven't, you should be pushing for it as well).\n\nNTA", "NTA, and while there can be consequences for sabotaging your own food, it would not be the case if it is something you would normally eat.

Bill is an asshole for sure! However, if you want to stay at this company, I\u2019d start documenting everything about his behaviour towards you, if you aren\u2019t already doing it. Maybe I\u2019m spending too much time on the internet, but I can\u2019t help but question if Bill\u2019s animosity towards you is race-related either. \n\nDepending on where you are, it may force HR to deal with Bill in order to avoid a bullying/harassment situation that might involve lawyers.", "NTA\n\nThat's the very definition of \"Fuck around and find out\"\ud83e\udd23", "Bill: he put peppers in his food even though knew I would eat!\n\nHR: so you're admitting you were the one eating his lunch. Interesting \ud83e\udd14 \n\n\nNTA. He literally have no one to blame but himself.", "As long as the food was still edible by you, definitely NTA.

H wouldn't get involved  because there was no proof.\n\nYou made a meal that you could eat, and he stole it, ate it and got sick.\n\nNTA", "I'd worry about that for sure...if your lunch bag has double zippers you might put a tiny luggage lock on it. I know that sounds like lunacy, but unfortunately you have a unhinged coworker.", "Isn't it a lovely term? My Canadian grandmother called them that.", "Or was it a spicy bite of *korma*\u2026.?\n\n(Thanks, I\u2019ll show myself out.)", "Well, good job GHOSTING him", "It really is. I had to Google it to even know what the OP was talking about. Glad I did.", "Loll good one!!!", "well to be fair, she put laxative in HER food. not other people\u2019s food.", "Bring in some of the same food, sans ghost peppers, and offer to let HR try it during the meeting.  Him complaining that you've poisoned him for your food being culturally spicy is straight racism; if this continues, get as much of a paper trail as you can and consult an employment lawyer."]}
