The hotness of it is what makes it unique. But if you want to make the pepper less hot, you can try and remove the seeds in the pepper.

You might know it\u2019s too spicy for the thief to enjoy - but you\u2019d have chowed down and enjoyed the meal if they didn\u2019t steal it. \n\nYou aren\u2019t going to hospitalize yourself with a laxative laced curry. Therein lies a fundamental difference in intent.", "Or better yet, change nothing because you can prepare your own food how you want it? Because there isn't a single leg this guy has to stand on because he was literally stealing?", "I am British with limited ability to tolerate spice - I would say garam masala is a spice but not hot spicy. It\u2019s kind of earthy to me. But I think here curry powder is really varied on if it\u2019s hot spicy - some is very mild and similar to Garam masala but some is very hot."]}
