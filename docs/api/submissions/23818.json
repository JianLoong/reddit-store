I would have used wasabi... but the result would be pretty similar, I expect.  Hard to feel sorry for the guy who is so pathetic that he feels the need to steal someone's lunch.  NTA\n\nI am curious though.  Are you female, and he's just a misogynist?  Tha'ts sort of what it sounds like, although it could be other things (racism?  jealousy?

Peppers are fit for human consumption and can't kill you unless you have an allergy or something. Though I remember I did eat a Carolina Reaper on a dare by my friends.

It is hard to get ghost pepper where I live as I live in a predominantly white suburb and there aren't many Indian shops here. My girlfriend had recently gone back to India to visit relatives and brought some ghost pepper back for me from India. Ghost pepper is exceptionally hot. It is rated more than 1 million SHU. If you don't regularly eat spicy food, it can really screw with your stomach. That's probably why Bill got sick.", "It is a type of butter chicken called murgh makhani. You can pretty much put any pepper you want into the dish, depending on how spicy you want it.", "Last time I ate a Carolina Reaper on a dare it felt like the actual Grim Reaper had come to take me away.", "I used this [recipe](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.archanaskitchen.com/bhut-jolokia-murgh-recipe-ghost-chilli-chicken-curry/amp) for my chicken murgh though I added a bit more ghost pepper than was suggested in the recipe.\n\nGhost peppers are one of the spiciest peppers you can find in India. The hotness of it is what makes it unique. But if you want to make the pepper less hot, you can try and remove the seeds in the pepper. It will reduce the heat a lot. \n\nYou can also soak the pepper in something like lime juice though it will change the taste of your final dish.\n\nI don't know what it is called in the USA, but when I cook these dishes that use a lot of spice, I have to cook with an extractor hood over the oven. These dishes create a strong smell and opening the windows won't be enough to stop it from stinking up your kitchen.", "Unfortunately, this is the only job I could find in the area.

So that's a win", "They have given him a formal reprimand and we have both been told to keep our distance from each other.", "I don't use ghost peppers in my lunch every day. The previous lunches Bill ate were not as spicy as this one. Ghost peppers are hard to find in the area I live and they aren't of very good quality when I do find them. My girlfriend brought back ghost peppers from her trip to India and this was the first time I put them in my lunch for work. Bill had never encountered this level of spice in my lunch before. You don't instantly have a reaction to a hot pepper unless you are eating it raw. If it is inside a dish it will be a couple of bites before it feels like your tongue is on fire.", "I didn't know about this website, but HR teams in the USA seem far worse than HR teams in the UK. At least HR sided with me.", "No I am a guy. I don't know what his problem is. I never did anything to him. He just has it out for me.", "Could have made special brownies, with laxitive in them.  Would also be appropriate... but could get OP into trouble.", "But I love how it clears up the sinuses!", "I don\u2019t wanna say this, but some people are only racist towards brown asian and not east asian people", "She may be right about that. Bill sounds like the type. He\u2019ll probably try to put something in your food or throw your lunch away.
