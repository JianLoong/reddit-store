I tried approaching HR about my lunch constantly being stolen, but HR said I didn't have any proof it was Bill so they couldn't do anything about it. But Bill is the only person who hates me enough to eat my lunch. \n\nTwo days ago, when I was making my lunch I put an extra ghost pepper into my curry. Ghost pepper can be very spicy for people not accustomed to high levels of spice in Asian food. I am Indian, and like my food extra spicy so this is a normal level of spice for me. But not for a middle-aged white guy like Bill who lives on jacket potatoes most of the time. \n\nThe next day, Bill predictably ate my lunch with the ghost peppers in them. He then became very ill as a result of eating the spicy food, confirming my suspicions that he's the lunch thief. Bill claimed to HR that I purposely tried to poison him by putting high levels of spice in my food. HR thankfully was on my side and basically said it was Bill's fault for eating a lunch that didn't belong to him. \n\nMy girlfriend is saying I am still an AH because I knew Bill would eat my lunch and I still put the ghost peppers inside it anyway.

File a formal complaint for harassment.", "NTA - I would watch a TV show which sole purpose is to show lunch stealing AHs at work get caught.", "My Dad had a Bill of his own when I was little.  My Mom fixed the problem by making dogfood sandwiches and instant chocolate pudding made with laxatives instead of milk.  \n\nAlso I would check the employee hand book.  Theft is usually put in there and a zero tolerance offence.  If you make a complaint to HR via email (cc'ed to your personal account and your boss) that Bill has been stealing from you mentioning that section and that this institutes a hostile work environment, their options drop to firing Bill or risking you suing the company.  I seriously doubt that Bill is worth risking a lawsuit to the company.", "NTA - it was your lunch, cooked to your taste.  Why should you use less spice in food that is not meant for consumption by anybody else?  Bill shouldn't eat your food, and should definitely not complain that the food he stole from you wasn't to his taste.", "NTA lol", "NtA - fuck that guy", "NTA, and your girlfriend is weird", "NTA! this would be great in r/PettyRevenge !", "NTA. There is a famous [Ask A Manager story](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/05/a-coworker-stole-my-spicy-food-got-sick-and-is-blaming-me-2.html) where a person who legitimately eats super spicy food was accused of booby trapping for a food thief. It's got some crazy twists and turns, but the important aspect is that it was not a trap and the person always ate food really spicy. But I recommend taking a read to help prepare any responses and really hammer home that your food was NOT boobytrapped because you like it that hot.", "Holy shit, dude. A guy who only ever ate potatoes suddenly eating ghost peppers...you better hope the dude doesn't die or you will have more than just your lunch being stolen to deal with.\n\nStill, NTA because you didn't purposely feed Bill the peppers.", "NTA - you're allowed to eat your own food the way you like it, and Bill is racist.
