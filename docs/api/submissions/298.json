I (27f) met my husband (27m) in university. Despite our careers and upbringings being entirely different, he was quite poor and an engineer, and I was upper middle class and a history major, we hit it off and have been together for nearly 9 years now, married for 3. After university we both found work, although after discovering I was pregnant, I chose to quit my career as we preferred to have a parent stay home to raise our daughter.\n\nOur daughter is now 3 years old, and I\u2019ve enjoyed every single second of raising her. According to my mother-in-law, she\u2019s a spitting image of my husband in both appearance and mannerisms, both of which I love. And now onto the issue at hand. \n\nAs an engineer, my husband spends a lot of time at the office. And when he works remotely, he is barricaded inside his office sitting through meeting after meeting and only coming out maybe once or twice for a quick snack between the hours of 8am and 7pm. He works a lot, and as such I take care of the house so he doesn\u2019t worry and stress over the state of the home (he is very much a clean freak). He will often times be home by 7:30, only to then spend his time either studying up and working from home, or watching some old western. And on the weekends, he goes to the country club with his work friends for hours (which I understand is important for networking), playing golf, racquet ball, and etc. \n\nThroughout all this, I do not mind being home alone with my daughter and often his mother and my parents. He still makes time for us to go out and enjoy ourselves a couple times a week and our relationship is as strong as ever. The one criticism I\u2019ve had for the past couple months is how little time he spends with our daughter. I\u2019ll be lucky if they spend even 2-3 hours together a week. I\u2019ve confided in his mother about this, and she says it\u2019s because he grew up without a father and doesn\u2019t know how to act, and my mother says it\u2019s just how men are. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to bring it up multiple times with him, and usually he\u2019ll brush me off with a \u201cokay\u201d or a \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d but when I brought it up today, I felt he got unreasonably angry. He brought up how he felt a child will always be better off in the hands of its mother alone, and how he\u2019s working and busy and he just doesn\u2019t have the time, and how his mother is basically always there to help take care of her. He says once she\u2019s old enough to start making memories and actually remembering things he\u2019ll have more time on his hands to take care of her and what not, and our argument kind of devolved from there. I can kind of see where he\u2019s coming from, given his upbringing and how busy he is, but at the same time he definitely has the time to spare if he wanted too.

The dad also thought he could just jump in later. The kids barely even says dad (he speaks fine), he has zero interest in him because he learned for years to leave him alone and is 100% focused with every need on his mom.\n\n\n\nIt also is not so important to spend two whole days at the country club for networking. This is bs.", "It makes me feel a million years old to reference this, but this is Cat's in the Cradle all over. \n\nFather always says he'll make time for his kid, one day, one day soon, later, he's just real busy at work now, just real busy with important things. Spoiler: He never does and it ends sadly.\n\nOP you're not TA but I don't think this  is really about your husband being busy. It's about he doesn't know how to emotionally connect with his family and possibly being scared by that, and so pours all his energy into work and figures that counts as 'caring' because men should support their family, right? From the story of his parent's he was never taught better either, but he has a responsibility to change that now.\n\nHe's wrong, and he could balance these things better if he could be open to figuring out his feelings.", "NTA. 3 year olds can remember things well into adulthood.  You're trying to ensure a good relationship between them. He's making excuses.", "NTA. Your husband not only needs to spend time with his daughter, he should absolutely be sharing her care 50% after his work hours, and setting aside weekends for family time. I wouldn't be at all surprised if your daughter doesn't have a relationship with him as an adult. He'll probably make a surprised pikachu face then but the rest of us will know when and how it went wrong.", "NTA. He needs to be involved in the day to day with the child.... not just when there are memories to be made.  He's essentially an absentee dad who happens to live under the same roof. His child is growing up without a dad.  Does he see that?", "Most definitely NTA. She may be 3, but it's a critical stage to form bonds. Your daughter is figuring out who is there for her and who's not. I get he's busy during the week, but he could still spend like 20 minutes a night reading her a book. And as for the whole \"networking\" thing I'm calling BS. My husband is an electrical/design engineer and was a mechanical engineer in the beginning and I've never heard of him having to network. Especially that many hours a week if it's truly a thing in your area, maybe a month. He's just using that as an excuse to go and play with his friends. \n\nI think you should consider marriage counseling. Because I foresee you growing more resentment towards him as time goes on and that'll obviously become detrimental to your marriage.", "NTA. The idea that he's going to pop into her life when he thinks she's old enough to have memories (which, as others have rightfully pointed out, is now) is super crappy. Why would she be comfortable hanging out with some guy she barely knows? Building a relationship with his kid starts yesterday.\n\nAlso, I really understand what having an upbringing like that can do to a person. But this is his golden opportunity to break that cycle and make sure his kid has it better than he did. She should know she has two parents who love her AND like hanging out with her. It sounds like you are doing a great job of that - and now it's his turn.", "INFO: What is he doing when he's not working? I don't understand how he's only able to spend that much time with her when there are weekends. How many hours a week exactly is he working?", "NTA - so sad to see that this poor child will grow up without a father too. You reap what you sow.", "NTA your husband is. Being a present father is *far* more important than networking. You are giving him way too much leeway.\n\nI can understand the working week it would be tough for such a demanding job, but the weekends he needs to prioritise family time. It sounds like he'll never make time", "NTA he is just making bullshit excuses so he can do what's fun (golf, country club, etc) while you watch the kid/house work full time.  Here is what you need to do.  Tell him you are going to take some personal time for yourself each week (Sat/Sun). During this personal you will not be spending time with your husband or your daughter, and you will find something to focus on like a hobby or doing stuff with friends.  Your time can even be spent at home while they at home also, but he will be 100% responsible for watching the kid and providing for all her needs during this time.  Tell him he is making the time for you and your personal needs (not for your daughter since he has those lame excuses).  Schedule the time randomly each week so he cant pawn her off on the babysitter or parents.  He is gettting \"unreasonable\" angry because he knows his arguments are bullshit, so he is reverting to emotional bullying (ie anger).  OR   keep telling yourself you \"understand\" where he is coming from and put up with his BS.  Also I am an engineer and I got good promotions and raises every year and I never spent 1 day networking.", "NTA, he's still a parent and it's not fair that he pushed all parenting onto you. And memories are form as soon as kid is 3 years old, so if he want to have relationship with his daughter, he need to put in work and effort. My husband works a lot, and he have unpredictable work when he never knows if his phone will ring in the middle of night and if he will spend two hours on the phone or if he'll be needed at work personally, but he always finds a way how to spend time with our children, he puts them to bed at the evenings he's home, he makes homework with our son and play with our daughter. He always work hard to find time spent with them and with me.", "NTA. Please go to family therapy. It sounds like he feels insecure in his ability to parent. Your husband deserves to feel the joy of being an involved parent to your wonderful daughter, and your daughter deserves to know her father! Please attend therapy so the two people you love most don\u2019t miss out on each other", "NTA. A father should bond with his child. Also, your husband seems to be stuck in the 1950's.", "NTA Your daughter will remember being three when she's 5 or 6 btw, she just won't retain many memories of it when she's an adult. They will continue to snowball into her relationship with her father, and she's going to be exposed to other families and see fathers that are very fond of their children and less traditionalist in their views of girls and women. \n\n  Do you agree with his ideas? Would you agree with those ideas for your daughter's family should she wish to have children? To me, someone choosing to spend 2-3 hours a week with their child does not have a parental relationship with them. You're a well-subsidised single parent. \n\n  Of course, if he starts spending more time with her, she's going to have a huge preference for you and he may use that as proof of his theories. My husband stays at home while I work (and spend the bulk of my free time with my kids) and the kids don't naturally prefer me. That's just not true.", "At least ask him to spend 1 whole day on the weekend a month with you and your baby. Zoo trip, museum,  pic nice, a random festival ...Also ask on holidays and birthdays he's available.  See if he can slowly ease into a dad role.\n\nTell him that's cheaper than therapy or teen pregnancy.  Which happens way too often to girls with daddy issues he is creating.", "Bang-maid. \nGoogle it.", "INFO : did you guys talked about life with a child before getting married or getting pregnant ?", "NTA", "Bonding can occur with some small father-daughter ritual that takes 10 minutes.  Ask him to read her a bedtime story each night.  Little Golden Books is a series of children stories that take 10 minutes to read.  Tell him if he does this every night you'll back off about his involvement with her. It will help him become comfortable with doing the dad things too, and may trigger more involvement. And at least once a week, get a babysitter during the day and you get out of the house and do something for yourself.", "NTA As long as you accept that him *not* doing the long hours and networking will almost certainly affect his career prospects, and as a result, your finances and lifestyle. If you can both accept that as the price for him being less work focused and spending more time with your daughter, then I think you'll all be better off for it.", "ESH\n\nHe, for the obvious reasons, he's not present as a father for your daughter.\n\nYou, for giving up on your job, which led you here. Now that 3 years have passed, your kid is old enough for kindergarten and you have a grandma willing to help out whenever necessary, you need to get yourself back on track. \n\nOnce a second salary comes in your household, your husband may find less stress in his work, since it won't all depend on him. Currently everything is about work, because if he loses his job you all become homeless. Also, if he's hoping for a promotion, he needs to work even more. That's why the weekend networking has become so important. \n\nYou and your husband decided to live as it was a century ago, when the woman stayed home and the husband provided. How present were dads in those days? Not much. So far this has worked out great for you as a family, but it seems it's not so great now.
