I used to ask stupid shit like that but like whether I looked fat or not or if I\u2019d lost weight etc etc.\n\nInstead of answering and being truthful, my partner at the time straight up refused to indulge the question and would not answer. Would tell me they were not going to answer and enable the behaviour.

Something can be \u201cslimming\u201d and make a person\u2019s body look slimmer, without that person actually being or appearing \u201cskinny.\u201d  I\u2019m not 100% sure if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here, but if you\u2019re withholding positive comments about your wife\u2019s appearance due to the \u201cfact\u201d that she is overweight, YTA. If you can\u2019t stomach the word \u201cskinny\u201d or \u201cslim,\u201d find some other meaningful and genuine way to compliment her\u2014e.g., comment on how the outfit enhances a particular feature\u2014if you want to boost her confidence. You can\u2019t expect her to take \u201cyou look good, but you don\u2019t look skinny\u201d as a compliment, and that\u2019s honestly a really upsetting thing to say to someone you love\u2026 Especially given the importance that she places in being \u201cskinny,\u201d which you yourself recognize and describe.", "NTA.\n\nI'll never understand why people ask this question if they're not going to like one of the two possible answers.

I'm sorry you guys have to go through this and I hope she can discover a path to a more healthy self image soon.\n\nI don't know if there is some tried and proven way to deal with this type of issue that is better than supportive honesty and affirmation.

Why not just say she looked nice in the dress and leave her at that? \n\nYou say you don't want to support your wife's unrealistic body image, which is fine.

It sounds like you made an adult statement to her as an adult.

Hopefully in counseling and with you not acting as an enabler she'll feel no need to drag you in. Just keep that living time without any inflection that she can accept as criticism.

Calling her skinny definitely would enable her dysmorphia. She genuinely is delusional if she thinks you're body shaming her for saying she's not skinny when she's clinically obese. A big part of the obesity pandemic that's killing millions worldwide is that society conditions us to tell obese people they're skinny. Why would they change if people tell them they're skinny. \n\nI'm really grateful to one of my exes who told me that I was getting fat when nobody else did.
