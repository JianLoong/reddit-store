You were honest with her and honestly if it were me, I\u2019d rather my wife be honest if I asked if I look fat in some thing and telling me I look skinnier in it or I I look good in it when I don\u2019t", "NTA, supporting is not lying.", "NAH\n\nShe wasn't asking if she looks skinny in the outfit, she asked if the outfit made her look slim.\n\nA lot of different clothes can be slimming and make you look slim in them, doesn't mean you are suddenly skinny. \n\nI realise it might not be an obvious distinction for everyone, but there is a difference in what she was asking.", "Might be a little late for you to see this OP, but I'd like to butt in, too.\n\nFirst of all, NAH. As you said, you don't want to enable her intrusive thoughts and don't want to give in to unhealthy validation. However that does put stress on the relationship.\n\nHave you ever been to therapy with her? It's not uncommon to have the spouse accompany the partner to therapy to discuss things together and to figure out how to deal with the disorder. It's also not uncommon for the couple to request it, so you don't have to wait for the therapist to make the \"first move\".\n\nI think it'd be a great deal of help if the therapist is sitting you two down, explaining how validating your partner when they have intrusive thoughts that stem from their disorder can strengthen the disorder and make healing more difficult. Together with the therapist you can figure out how to respond to it, ideally have a certain phrase that you will say every time, like \"I love you but you know I am not supposed to answer.\"\n\nAlso this could make it less personal. As of know, she fishes for a compliment and you say something that sounds insulting to her. It's from her spouse, it's personal. But if she knows the therapist told you to not validate, the invalidation won't be as strongly linked to your feelings towards her as before.\n\nLiving with a disorder can be tough and I wish her all the healing and the both of you much strength and love.", "NTA. She\u2019s not skinny, she can\u2019t deal with it. That would be a her problem to sort out. \n\nDo not feed the dysmorphia. It\u2019s a bitch of a disorder and she needs to see herself as she is and hear the truth.", "NTA I'd rather hear \"it doesn't matter if you're skinny, you are beautiful and I love you\" than \"yes sure babe you're skinny\" I also think it's healthier to divert her attention away from the skinny question\n\nIt's not what she wants to hear in that moment, but looking back she will appreciate it (once she has healed a bit) \n\nI used to ask my mom if I'm skinny or skinnier than XYZ and she REFUSED to answer the question she said \"it doesn't matter you are beautiful and just right don't compare yourself to others\" and as a teenager I hated it I just wanted to hear yes you're skinny. But now looking back I'm forever grateful that she taught me/tried to teach me to not think about being skinny", "hm tough one here, i'd say don't lie to her about her medical conditions but do tell her like this isn't a lie that PROPORTIONATELY compared to other women she is SKINNier", "NTA. Enabling her delusion will just make her worse. She needs to learn to see her body as it is and accept it. She clearly has some kind of disorder and I hope she makes headway in therapy.", "NTA. Wife is crazy. Seek help", "NTA- honesty is the best policy, but when dealing with appearance and women, tread carefully and sugar coat it", "She identifies as skinny. NTA", "YTA because all she asked was whether the dress was slimming in this instance. Not if she looks skinny.  You didn't have to say that. She didn't ask in that instance whether she looked skinny. You were cruel and acted with bias because of the questions/statements she made in the past.", "When you say obese do you mean an unhealthy weight or like a big build. Because if she\u2019s morbidly obese don\u2019t encourage that behaviour it\u2019s not ok to be fat to the point it causes health issues.", "NTA for not telling her she's skinny, but the slim comment thing was a bit obnoxious on your end.\n\nasking ' does this dress make me look slim ' is basically asking if it's flattering. skinny people do it too, for instance they'll ask ' does this dress make me look fat? ' to ask if it's unflattering. she's not asking if she's skinny or fat by asking if something makes her look slimmer/fatter, she's asking if it's flattering.\n\nyeah, you're gonna be fat regardless of how a dress goes on your body, but you can still ask if something makes you look ' slimmer ' bc it's essentially asking if its flattering to her curves, body, and whatnot.", "Here is the thing, you know she is sensitive, so rather than deflating her, since you thought she looked beautiful, don\u2019t go for the gut punch and tell her flat out she doesn\u2019t look skinny.  Come up with a better way to tell her the dress looks great on her.  How about.  Wife (insert endearing nickname), you look gorgeous in that dress, and I cannot wait to take you to dinner at XYZ (insert favorite restaurant). That\u2019s it! Women want validation from our partners! We want to feel beautiful! That is why she asked.  Telling her publicly (in a store) that she didn\u2019t look skinny in the dress, and thus making her cry was not the time to address her ongoing \u201cpossible\u201d mental health issues.  Now, I suggest at a more opportune time you sit down with your wife and gently suggest she talk to a therapist.  That you love her and support her and are worried.  A therapist or her doctor can diagnose body dysmorphia, not you.  Then she can get treatment, whatever that might be.  Knowing her husband loves and accepts her will be key!", "INFO.

I would be more upset if my partner let me go out in something that wasn\u2019t flattering to my figure instead of being honest with me.", "NTA", "YTA", "NTA but you could\u2019ve worded it a little differently. Women are sensitive, and words affect us.", "Just want to say, if OP's wife is seeing a therapist and a doctor for this, OP damn well better be working with them and making sure what he is saying is acceptable.  Self esteem can be heavily tied to ones body image.  OP may not mean to, but he could be doing major damage to his wife's mental health and undermining the work the therapist and doctor are doing.  His intent may be good, but the wrong words can devastate.", "if he tells her that the dress makes her look slimmer, she will absolutely take that as him saying she IS skinny, not that she LOOKS a bit skinnier. in any other case i'd agree, but this is exactly what she wants to hear and it would just make her problem worse. She may see it as an insult, but considering her mentality around this topic, he would just enable her behavior. She needs to accept herself for who she is but to me it sounds like she has severe body dismorphia and feeding into it won't make her problems any better.", ">Especially given the importance she places in being \"skinny\"\n\nIf being skinny was important to her then she wouldn't be obese", "> Because if it was the first, then you'd be an asshole. She was just asking if you agreed the dress looked nice and minimized problem areas.\n\nSo what is he supposed to answer if it doesn't?", "> Dude...she asked if you agreed that it made her look slim...she gave you the perfect out. All you had to do was tell her it looked slimming.\n\nWhat if it didn't? Are people supposed to outright lie nowadays? Then the people asking would know the answer is always supposed to be positive, wo what's the use of asking in the first place?", "Right! When I'm trying on outfits my fella is my favourite person to do it with because he's great at it and he's the only person that will flat out say it's a bit bellyish - this means absolutely not \ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s funny to see TA mentioned in the wild \ud83d\ude05 TA is amazing", "LOL, sounds like you've never been shopping with a woman.", "Yeah, all the replies I'm seeing having a go at the OP because 'she asked if it was slimming not if she was slim' and 'slim and skinny don't mean the same thing and people don't use them interchangeably' (i feel like I'm going crazy seeing this one everywhere here bc people absolutely do use them interchangeably). If she's got a bad case of BDD the OP should not be indulging her delusions\\* and should stay right away from using any synonyms for thin or any comments on what clothes are doing for her body.\n\nIf she's in therapy for BDD, her therapist will have told her \\*not\\* to ask these questions, to refrain from the urges and that it's not fair to put OP on the spot where  he either reinforces the delusions, upsets her by being honest, or if he refuses to play into it, badgering him until he cracks the shits with her and an argument ensues\n\n\\*I have struggled with BDD in the past, I am comfortable referring to bodily perception as delusional", "Sexist much?", "Trust me when I say us men?

Go look it up because it's not subjective.", "As a fat woman, in the context of clothes slim means \"does it make my shape look better\" - whereas skinny is straight up thin. I make my own clothes and there is a visible difference in how I look between when I wear leggings and t-shirts I've bought off a rack and clothes I made for myself to my own measurements - well fitting clothes can actually make me look slimmer - my curves smooth out, they emphasise my hourglass shape so that while I know I am fat, and I am undoubtedly larger than most people I know, I still look slimmer in those clothes than in the ones I slob about in. You need only look into TV costuming and/or historical garments to understand how clothes can change considerably how you look. The example off the top of my head is from the Witcher series 1. Henry Cavill and Joey Batey are the same physical shape and size, but in the series their characters look like they are different sizes because the costume designers use clothing to make Batey slimmer as Jaskier, hiding his broad shoulders and height with their choice of jackets, whereas with Cavill as Geralt they emphasise his shoulders and chest to make him seem physically bigger. Clothes cannot change the reality of your body but they really can alter the appearance of them and I'd say that is the difference between skinny and slim as a woman - skinny is the reality, but slim is the appearance. As a fat woman I will never be skinny but I can *appear* slimmer.", "Slim is healthy. Skinny often is not.", "Damn. That\u2019s messed up.", "Exactly. There's a huge difference between looking skinny and an outfit being slimming.", "Jesus the cope in this response lol. There is no difference, they are synonyms, just like you can say something makes you look slimmer, it's the same as something making you look skinnier."]}
