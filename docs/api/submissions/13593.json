If you have no idea, find out.\n\nAlso, I am somewhat confused on whether she was asking if the dress made her look more slender (as in, she's fat, but it's flattering and the design makes her look less fat) or if she was genuinely asking if it made her look skinny (like it miraculously made a size 20 appear like a size 2 and some literal body dysmorphia is happening where she is deluded about her appearance)\n\nBecause if it was the first, then you'd be an asshole. She was just asking if you agreed the dress looked nice and minimized problem areas. If it's the second, then see the aforementioned doctors and follow what they advise.\n\nI think you should probably refuse to engage at all in any discussion of weight or size.

I understand your wife is in therapy, but I think you need to calmly explain that you can no longer go clothing shopping with her and will not talk about her skinniness, only her beauty.

Let her know you are struggling with knowing the right things to do and say and would love someone with training who knows her situation to help you navigate it in the best possible way.
