He IS still capable of thinking for himself and knows what\u2019s going on, he\u2019s just kinda.. forgetful of long term memories, like names. My step-mom uses this to control his entire life. I\u2019m not even allowed to visit him without her being present and her permission first.", "Steve and I have a very bad relationship. I haven\u2019t seen him in years. I think showing up for the first time in a long time to demand he return the flag would only anger him and cause him to be more likely to keep it just for spite.", "Can you ask Steve directly and explain your attachment to your grandpa's flag?", "Ah, shit. That sucks.", "If he already has possession of the item, and would keep it for spite, and in years hasn't matured enough to respond well to an email or text to the effect that you know you haven't spoken in awhile and you hope he's doing well and if he would be so kind you would truly appreciate a photo of the flag, and that you would even pay him for the object itself, it may be unlikely that you can get the flag back even once his own second wife unloads his stuff, or ever. \n\nIs there a way you can respect the memories of your family without possession of that item? Physical objects can also be lost or destroyed plenty of other ways. Can you write out your thoughts and feelings about the people involved or otherwise pay tribute to them and carry on the meaning?

SM can go hang out with flying monkeys. Sheesh.", "NTA. call him the English Man, cuz he takes what's not his", "NTA\n\nI might consider calling Steve directly or getting Dad involved.", "NTA.  Talk to Steve directly.  As a service member, he should understand the importance of why you should get it.", "See OP's comments about dad. He had a stroke and is 100% under step mom's thumb. Who is giving his stuff away to her own kids.", "That\u2019s really concerning. I would call adult protective services right away, she\u2019s giving his things away to her kids while he can\u2019t stop them, when he would probably want them to go to his.", "If he's in the military now, try and reach out to his command. They take respect pretty seriously and would probably be pissed if they heard the story.", "this. If he has/had any pride in being in the military he wouldn't have taken another service member that's not related to hims flag anyway.", "Yes, social worker here, please look into elder abuse. The fact tt you cant visit your dad without stepmom being around is especially alarming, and controlling. These are the signs we will usually use to Investigate further", "Im a veterans wife. I followed my husband in the service for nearly half a decade and I delt with 3 deployments with him before he quit finally. The military takes respect super seriously. Id reach out to your stepbrother and talk to him first. Be respectful and nice but explain he was someone important to you and you loved your grandpa so having is flag is meaningful to you. No need to explain he died when you were so young. If he still won't give it back Id go the nuclear route and reach out to his Sargeant or commanding officer. Explain the situation to them and how your stepbrother took a family military funeral flag of a person he isnt related to and how you would like your families flag back. Im betting you'll get that flag if you do this.", "NTA. However, I think it was in your step-moms right to give the flag away. While it was a poor decision on her end for sure, it's legally hers(&her husbands), you cannot demand it or summon it. What you can do is go to Steve and explain how much your grandfathers flag means to you and if he is willing to part with it. Or plea your case to your dad, see if he is willing to help you out.", "NTA - just talk to steve, he probably gets it", "NTA but that doesn\u2019t make much difference if step mom won\u2019t give it to you and you have a bad relationship with her son.\nI am sorry. You are certainly not wrong for asking", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d be pissed too. Steve is being paid for a job he chose to do, it shouldn\u2019t mean he gets blatant favoritism by your step-mom giving him not only both flags, but the one from someone who isn\u2019t his grandfather, and who he never met/had a relationship with.\n\nYour stepmother is the one playing favorites here. Even if Steve was your full blood sibling I\u2019d still think this was shitty.\n\nAnd to be frank, your dad married her - you didn\u2019t.", "OP you need to contact someone from the state about potential elder abuse. Because from just a little bit you gave me it sounds like your step mom is abusing your father. Maybe not physically but the fact that she\u2019s dividing up his assets and giving away his stuff, and will not allow you to be around him without her present is a form of abuse.", "She needs investigated, she\u2019s already started taking what she wants and when there\u2019s nothing left. She\u2019ll divorce him and leave their debts to his family (you) you need to get this investigation started. Go see your dad without her!", "NTA odds are if you approach him directly avoiding the step mom,  Steve will understand about the flag.", "That's horrifying, please get him a legal power of attorney while he's still here and able to make these decisions. Have a lawyer sit down with him and designate a health plan to follow when he's no long able to make these decisions and have him choose someone to carry them out. They will have power of attorney and their word will be what the doctors and hospitals have to listen to, not your step-mom.\n\nElder/medical abuse is extremely common and sounds like your step mom is doing just that. Please protect him while you still can.", "Then don't go to steve, go to Steve's command.  I don't think his superiors would be very happy to hear that he is keeping your grandad's funeral flag.", "It doesn\u2019t seem like OP has even asked Steve yet. Even if I had bad blood with someone, I would be unbelievably more pissed if the person went over my head, especially in the military, and brought family BS into it. I understand the connection to military respect, but that doesn\u2019t seem like the best route. Maybe try another mutual family member that could have influence.", "Demanding he return the flag is probably not going to go well.\n\nBut sending a polite message noting that he was given your grandfather's flag, and asking if you would be able to look after it seems a lot more reasonable.\n\nIt also helps that this clearly isn't cash grab - you don't want his classic car because you know it is valuable and can sell it, you want something that means little to anyone outside of you and your immediate family.", "NTA, I don\u2019t have anything especially helpful to add, but if you have any trouble with finding resources in your area for reporting elder abuse, feel free to reach out. You may also want to talk to an attorney about potential protections for your dad. Your stepmom might have a guardianship or something less restrictive, like a POA, or nothing, but those things can be challenged if she\u2019s not acting in his best interests. I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re in this situation.", "NTA, but have you not spoken with your father?  It is his possession.", "NTA. Your grandfather's flag should stay with your blood family. It might be different had Steve met your grandfather and had a relationship with him, but that's not the case", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, who divvies up things when people are still alive like that? Weird. \n\nSecondly, did your dad okay her giving his father's flag to him? If he did, I'm sorry, but your dad is a dick.\n\nThirdly, as a kid of a Marine those flags are not something you just 'give away'. My father passed two years ago and the thought of someone giving away his flag to someone they never knew or that never knew them would be so disrespectful not just to him and his memory, but to those family members or close friends that could want a piece to remember him by.", "NTA.  And have you asked your dad what he wants?", "I haven\u2019t had the chance to speak with him as the only way anyone is allowed to call or see him is with his wife present.", "Some of the worst human beings I've ever encountered are proud veterans. Don't bank on military respect to overcome a bad family history or really anything at all. Signing away X number years of your life to the US government doesn't make you any better or different than any other human being walking this planet or any more or less likely of being a decent or horrible person.", "NTA you are in the right.", "NTA\n\nYou seem to have Steve's 'number' so to speak, so approaching him directly is probably not a good idea.\n\nYou have many reasons to contact a social worker, and need to point out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is giving away your GRANDFATHER'S and father's things to people that are not local and not related, in order to keep his actual grandchildren and your father's children from inheriting them, now that your father is helpless and cannot object.\n\nYou are not allowed to speak to your father alone.\n\nYou are only allowed to visit after giving extreme advance notice.\n\nHe is blind and not completely aware, and she is keeping him isolated most of the time.\n\nIf your father has not been getting regular checkups is something you might want to find out also.", "NTA, that flag should be in a blood relatives possession", "NTA. Ask him directly", "I suggest contacting Steve directly. Most people in the service (myself included) would understand and honor such a request, especially given he had no lineage or relationship with your paternal grandfather.", "He already has it, and he and step-lol are the only ones who can return it. Step-mom, won't, so there's no kids in asking him directly.\n\nIf so that first, then go through his Commander if you don't care about burning bridges more than the flag.\n\nShe's doing you and your dad dirty. She could be also liquidating his assets before he passes."]}
