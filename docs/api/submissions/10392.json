It got my attention.", "But also make it clear that she fucked up by growing the loaded \u201cgaslighting\u201d. And in fact was technically her that was gaslighting whether intentionally or not though I feel at that point it was lightly intentional to avoid the obvious that she didn\u2019t know when 9/11 happened. But point out the serious character flaws that that points to the potential of. That she needs to work on her need to not look like a fool when she was being one. Learn to laugh along with it. We all have moments like that, it\u2019s only something to hang up on if you make it one like she did. But if she is willing to publicly make you look or feel like an abuser for something as simple as she forgot a date for a historical event, that points to a worse problem in my opinion. But we all make mistakes, if she\u2019s willing to acknowledge work on those issues then that\u2019s great. But one thing I\u2019ve seen on here and with one ex friends relationship, is that sometimes the random moments like that added up and they became straight up abusive. So definitely learn to take a step back and go over events without emotions every so often because emotions are their greatest tools. Not saying she is an abuser from this instance. Could be a one off honest mistake. Just be careful and follow your gut. But definitely try to nip in the bud that she\u2019s trying to make you look like an abuser, intentional or not that\u2019s what she did when she accused you of gaslighting", "Wait, if you're all roughly the same age and you all know that, why would she think that she wasn't alive when your friend was three?", " I'm not mistaken. A child needs to eat more than that.", "> Most people's first memories are from about that age.\n\nI assume the OP means clear and detailed to an unusual magnitude. I don't think most humans have high-quality memories of being 3 years old. No one I know has ever attested to it.", "Yeah, my earliest memory is from when I was 3, and it wasn't even emotionally intense or anything. I just remember sitting at the table talking about what we should name the new baby when she is born. We were eating chicken, it was delicious, I thus logically suggested we name the new baby Chicken. Now, of course this story has been told many times by my parents, but I remember the kitchen table shape and color and that was replaced not long after so parts of it are definitely my own memory. The story being told over and over probably just helped me keep remembering it. \n\nAnd a few months later I remember getting ice cream with my grandma when my sister was born, and obviously my parents weren't there and my grandma doesn't remember it at all.", "I can date my first memories to about 3 years old. The trick is that something had to have happened that you can date. \"I played in the sandbox in by back yard\" could have happened at 2 years old or 5 years old. But anyone born at the end of the 90's probably has their first distinct dateable memory being 9/11.", "Yeah, idk that whole friend group is weird. There are those with photographic memories or just strong ones in general (I can often recite conversations from months - years ago), but there's nothing particularly out of the ordinary about your first memory being from around that age.", "I think visual things can trigger memories, no matter how young you are. \n\nFor example, there\u2019s a photo of me at 2 or 3 crying hysterically at Easter. I was told that was a reaction to the Easter Bunny. And I do remember \u201cears\u201d bouncing around in a window and my dad taking me out to look for the Easter Bunny who had miraculously disappeared. \n\n(Turned out my donkey uncle was being a cheeky sh!t with a large rabbit toy, playing around at the window). \n\nIf it weren\u2019t for that photo, and a retelling, I probably wouldn\u2019t remember it all. \n\nAnd this was a handful of decades ago. \n\nSo, maybe OPs gf never \u201csaw\u201d anything so can\u2019t remember. Or she can\u2019t do the maths. \n\nI have now come to the point that I have forgotten what I was replying to. The irony. Oh well.", "Eh, Hanlon's Razor applies here, I think. Never attribute to malice that which can be equally explained by ignorance. You're looking at a single interaction with an OP who has already dismissed the notion of her age being in question, no reason to start assuming any sprawling conspiracies are being woven by some spiderqueen caught in her own web of lies. \n\nShe probably just forgot the date and got embarrassed and tried (in vain) to shut down the conversation to avoid drawing further attention to the brief moment of stupidity", "Idk. Sometimes it's better to sweep it under the rug if it's an one off. But definitely bring it up if it happens again", "Sure, except she accused OP of gaslighting. That's malicious and was a lie, so I feel either is possible. Ignorance or lying all the time. OP would know which was more likely.", "Yeah, accusing someone of gaslighting is accusing them of being abusive."]}
