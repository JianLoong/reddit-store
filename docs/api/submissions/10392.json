I told my girlfriend that she would have been alive, she just would have been like 3 years old since she was really young. \n\nShe told me no, she would not have been alive, and to stop acting like I knew her life experiences better than her. I honestly thought this was some sort of sarcastic joke, so I laughed her off and said, \u201cyeah okay, very funny.\u201d\n\nBut she was seriously mad and told me to \u201cstop fucking gaslighting\u201d her, and the whole mood was kind of killed after that.

Still, how odd.", "NTA this is not gaslighting omg. GF read to much Instagram pop psychology. I don\u2019t like when words describing serious specific issues get thrown around carelessly like that. Gaslighting is at play in abusive relationships. You weren\u2019t being abusive in that situation. She was just objectively wrong and didn\u2019t want to admit it. And it\u2019s not okay to throw such a heavy loaded word at your partner, implying that they are abusing you, in such a trivial situation.\n\nAlso you guys the same age\u2026 if you were alive for 9/11 she obviously was too. Maybe she didn\u2019t know the year when it happened ? Either that or she has didn\u2019t want to lose face in front of your friends.

I remember what my mom was doing on 9/11. Painting letters so she could hang them in my room to spell my name. I find out years later that\u2019s what she was doing on 9/11. Also why does your girlfriend want a disorder? I\u2019m not sure why your girlfriend is mad\u2026 but maybe don\u2019t bite the bullet and find out\u2026 just apologize and have her explain what she would like to remember if she had this \u201cdisorder\u201d\u2026", "UM....WOW...OK..........NTA\n\nI don't know what else to say...\n\nAt some point privately discuss this and in that talk tell her 9/11 was in 2001 and she was born in what somewhere from 1997-98? Like ask her  privately so she isn't embarrassed.. tell her not to feel bad, everyone says 9/11 not 9/11/2001 some people are stuck in 2020 hell so they are think it was 20 years ago instead of 22 almost 23 years ago.

She's struggling with math + history like I do with geography \ud83d\ude02\n\nPer a psych class a few years ago early memories are typically of emotionally intense moments like getting lost in a store, being scared by a Halloween decoration, or, y'know, a parent freaking out over a terrorist attack.
