But point out the serious character flaws that that points to the potential of. That she needs to work on her need to not look like a fool when she was being one. Learn to laugh along with it. We all have moments like that, it\u2019s only something to hang up on if you make it one like she did. But if she is willing to publicly make you look or feel like an abuser for something as simple as she forgot a date for a historical event, that points to a worse problem in my opinion. But we all make mistakes, if she\u2019s willing to acknowledge work on those issues then that\u2019s great. But one thing I\u2019ve seen on here and with one ex friends relationship, is that sometimes the random moments like that added up and they became straight up abusive. So definitely learn to take a step back and go over events without emotions every so often because emotions are their greatest tools. Not saying she is an abuser from this instance. Could be a one off honest mistake. Just be careful and follow your gut.

I just remember sitting at the table talking about what we should name the new baby when she is born. We were eating chicken, it was delicious, I thus logically suggested we name the new baby Chicken. Now, of course this story has been told many times by my parents, but I remember the kitchen table shape and color and that was replaced not long after so parts of it are definitely my own memory. The story being told over and over probably just helped me keep remembering it. \n\nAnd a few months later I remember getting ice cream with my grandma when my sister was born, and obviously my parents weren't there and my grandma doesn't remember it at all.", "I can date my first memories to about 3 years old. The trick is that something had to have happened that you can date. \"I played in the sandbox in by back yard\" could have happened at 2 years old or 5 years old. But anyone born at the end of the 90's probably has their first distinct dateable memory being 9/11.", "Yeah, idk that whole friend group is weird. There are those with photographic memories or just strong ones in general (I can often recite conversations from months - years ago), but there's nothing particularly out of the ordinary about your first memory being from around that age.", "I think visual things can trigger memories, no matter how young you are. \n\nFor example, there\u2019s a photo of me at 2 or 3 crying hysterically at Easter.

But, I don\u2019t think having early childhood memories is a disorder. I can remember things from before I could talk (things confirmed but my mother), the same goes for my brother.

Do I have a weird disorder? \n\nMy little knowledge of psychology would say aren't these flashbulb memories that we would remember, anyways?", "Honestly I'm wondering if she's lowkey BSing. I have clear \"memories\" of 9/11 that come exclusively from the stories that my parents have told me repeatedly over the years. I know they're \"fake\" because I *only* \"remember\" those stories, nothing else from that day or time period (I was born in '97, so I would've been 3 or 4 as well). I don't say that I have memories of 9/11 because I don't really: I have fabricated, reconstructed \"memories\" built from those of the others who were around me at that time. If you had asked me if I remembered 9/11 when I was in middle school, before I'd heard my parents' story dozens of times over, I'd have honestly said \"no\". Because I *don't* actually remember my Dad waiting for me at the bus stop while fearfully staring out over the treeline at the column of smoke that you could see all the way from central NJ. I *don't* actually remember building two towers out of building blocks and imitating a plane crashing into them, then telling my disturbed parents, \"It's okay, everybody lived this time.\" I've just heard those stories enough times to internalize them. \n\nPeople forget that memories aren't set in stone. Memories are fluid, suggestible, and increasingly subjective. If you hear the same story involving yourself enough times, you begin to remember it the way that it's been told to you, not the way that you actually experienced it.\n\nSome people really *do* just have vivid early memories, to be fair. But, as other commenters have pointed out, that's hardly a \"disorder\", nor is it even a comorbidity or symptom of any disorder that I know of.", "There's a big difference between saying \"I don't remember this\" and insisting that since you don't remember it, you weren't alive. \n\nMy mom remembers the Challenger disaster because the school made them watch it live. My uncle remembers the fall of the Berlin Wall more clearly because he was stationed there during his time in the military. Neither would say they weren't alive for either event just because it doesn't stick out in their memories.", "(I misread this as \"I'm two years **old** and I don't remember 9/11\" and was momentarily blown away by your incredible reading and writing abilities.)", "Or she's younger than she said she is?", "Maybe, but aren\u2019t people like\u2026 not self conscious of their age until around their 30\u2019s and up?", "The quickest way to find gaslighting is to find the person using the word gaslighting!", "Not if she was not of legal drinking age when she met OP.", "Yet it is true and she sounds like an idiot.

NTA, your girlfriend sounds genuinely awful.", "Stop gaslighting the sub bro", "I have a high-quality memory of being 2 years, 3 months, and 9 days old. It was the day my little sister came home from the hospital. And yes, I do know other people telling you stories can make \"fake\" memories, but this one happened to be that I was the only one in the living room looking out the window and everyone was outside greeting my mom with their back to me! There are pictures of my meeting her at the hospital, I just have no memory of *that!* Lmao\n\nI know it's very unusual though. Otherwise, I'm not sure I have a strong memory until about 4 years old.", "My husband has very clear memories from when he was 2-3.

Dating an early childhood memory is very difficult, especially when you have no context. I once told my mom I remembered sitting in the front seat of the car with my feet up on the dash while wearing footy pajamas and going down a specific, highly identifiable road, and she told me the only time I had footy pajamas was when I was a baby! She said we'd have been going down that particular road to take my brother, who is three years older than me, to pre-school. This was in the eighties so people still put their babies in the front seat... It wasn't a huge, traumatic incidence, just a memory of going up and down this hilly road. I certainly don't remember most of my early childhood like that, but people do remember the most random things.", "I guess? I felt like the implication was that she remembers far earlier memories than most people, while HSAM is more about vividness of memories, from what I understand. My point was more that having vague memories of a traumatic or notable event that happened when you were three is pretty common, not that it seemed unlikely to me.", "First isolated memory or lots of clear and detailed memories?", "I feel like accusing someone of gaslighting isn't something that can be swept under the rug.", "People know how old they are at a very young age lol", "Wtf no.

I\u2019m sorry, one guy already thought I meant people aren\u2019t aware of how old they are.\n\nDo you mean it\u2019s ignorant to say that people are only unhappy with their age once they\u2019re in their 30s?\n\nOr do you think meant they didn\u2019t know their age until then too?", "I was at my grandparent's house! No idea if it was overcast, just day time. But I do remember the feel of the chair I climbed on to look out! That's so cool that someone else has such a similar memory at such a close age :)"]}
