But point out the serious character flaws that that points to the potential of. That she needs to work on her need to not look like a fool when she was being one. Learn to laugh along with it. We all have moments like that, it\u2019s only something to hang up on if you make it one like she did. But if she is willing to publicly make you look or feel like an abuser for something as simple as she forgot a date for a historical event, that points to a worse problem in my opinion. But we all make mistakes, if she\u2019s willing to acknowledge work on those issues then that\u2019s great. But one thing I\u2019ve seen on here and with one ex friends relationship, is that sometimes the random moments like that added up and they became straight up abusive. So definitely learn to take a step back and go over events without emotions every so often because emotions are their greatest tools. Not saying she is an abuser from this instance. Could be a one off honest mistake. Just be careful and follow your gut.

I just remember sitting at the table talking about what we should name the new baby when she is born. We were eating chicken, it was delicious, I thus logically suggested we name the new baby Chicken. Now, of course this story has been told many times by my parents, but I remember the kitchen table shape and color and that was replaced not long after so parts of it are definitely my own memory. The story being told over and over probably just helped me keep remembering it. \n\nAnd a few months later I remember getting ice cream with my grandma when my sister was born, and obviously my parents weren't there and my grandma doesn't remember it at all.", "I can date my first memories to about 3 years old. The trick is that something had to have happened that you can date. \"I played in the sandbox in by back yard\" could have happened at 2 years old or 5 years old. But anyone born at the end of the 90's probably has their first distinct dateable memory being 9/11.", "Yeah, idk that whole friend group is weird. There are those with photographic memories or just strong ones in general (I can often recite conversations from months - years ago), but there's nothing particularly out of the ordinary about your first memory being from around that age.", "I think visual things can trigger memories, no matter how young you are. \n\nFor example, there\u2019s a photo of me at 2 or 3 crying hysterically at Easter.

Sometimes it's better to sweep it under the rug if it's an one off. But definitely bring it up if it happens again", "Sure, except she accused OP of gaslighting.

We were visiting my family in Italy to celebrate my 3rd birthday. My parents lost me at the airport because I just took off to listen to a Mariachi band - they obviously found me in the end. \n\nSame trip and I run away from my aunt's dog because I was scared of him (now that I'm older I understand he just wanted to play - he was a good boy). He followed me, I panicked and looked behind me the whole time I run away until I looked back in front of me and my face hits a parking car. \n\nImmediately to the hospital because I was bleeding a lot and I remember the room I was in, how they cut my lip a bit and how my mum was screaming in panic outside of the room and then I remember how they sewn the wound. \n\nAlmost 28 years later and I still have a visible scar if you know where to look. \n\nI'm curious what the disorder is because I never heard of it.\n\nEdit: I've a lot of clear memories from my childhood because I always had to check my surroundings.
