What say you? It is just necessary to let people know for the greater good, many lives have probably saved because of knowing that story... Plus, you keep replying and and you are also fostering the conversation, you're also part of the problem\n\nEdit: I cant reply to any of the comments made by the person I replied to and all the comments have been labeled unavailable so im guessing they blocked me. That person would rather let babies die yet they keep calling out people who talk about a dead baby.. which kinda just told me that they only care about that aspect of the story instead of looking into the bigger picture.", "Why are you being downvoted?", "They do make a ok with the Vatican host that is so low in gluten it shouldn't cause a [noticable] reaction in most celiacs. So very Catholic celiacs will do the tiniest bit of that once or twice a year if they feel just the wine alone is not \"proper\" enough for them.

You or her? \n\nSo yeah, settle down.", "I'm just curious, was this a Sikh based prasad they serve in the gurdwaras as well? If so there's sweeten water with prayers (usually Japji Sahib) that can be given to the baby.", "Are you Bengali by any chance, OP ?? We do have a tradition called \" Mukhebhaat\" which means 'putting-rice-in-the-mouth' for kids who are a couple of months old. However, even in India, if the parents don't think that the kid is ready to start solid, they delay the ceremony. The ceremony marks the child starting to eat solids.\n\nIt sucks that your mom thinks making the kid eat solids, when the kid isn't ready for it, is some tradition. As far as I know, that is not how the ceremony works.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "NTA. Your household, your rules and your responsibility. Safety comes first. Traditions are great and all, but it\u2019s not an obligation to be followed (unless you commit, but in this case it\u2019s a baby so she doesn\u2019t have a choice in this matter therefore freeing her from the obligation to follow it) especially if it\u2019s not safe for the child.", "This sounds like both my MIL and my mother with her great-grandson (my grandson). And if she is anything like them you will need to be very careful because it will not stop. \n\nAs Indians, I would say there are various cultural issues at play. Firstly, tradition as you mentioned, then Indian parents not really believing that their kids ever grow up so they don't need to listen to their kids and finally there's the  excuse of good intentions. She was giving your baby blessings, so if the baby chokes or gets diarrhoea, it's not her fault because she had \"good intentions\" and you are unreasonable for getting upset. Same with the time she took your child out to show off without your knowledge or permission. And the time she almost dropped your baby despite being warned not to pick up the baby while she is having dizzy spells.  These are just some of the things we have had to deal with.\n\nMy advice is to be firm and vigilant in order to protect your child. She will not like it, she will not understand, it will change your relationship with her, but it has to be done. Commiserations and good luck.", "NTA. No means no. She doesn't get an opinion.", "Nah. This is a cultural thing. They've been doing it the same way for ever and for you to marry into a different culture only to look at it like it's wrong is just.... Antagonistic.", "Look, you are definitely being a bit overprotective here. But I think the main concern is that your mom just blatantly ignored your wishes. Thats a pretty big red flag. Who knows what else she will just do to your child later on in life after you said no.", "I'm confused because OP stated the baby was not fed?", "apply cold water to burned areas. not that it helps in severe cases", "Btw, doctors in India also agree that you don't give kids any food other than breastmilk or formula until they're six months old.

And that is honey. \n\nAn actual solid food - doesn't even matter what it is - is bad for the baby. As for just touching the baby with it - babies can lick their lips. \n\nYou're NTA.

She was trying to force a religious ceremony on your baby and you told her not to. She did it anyway.\n\nOut of curiosity, did you tell her not to only because of the potential implications of a small baby ingesting solids, or because you objected to your child being used as a stage prop in their religion? I mean NTA either way, just wondered. Personally I'd have gone at her with both.", "I would say NTA\n\nBut imma just say if you don't expect the Indian traditions which is quite fair since you r the mother, don't expect the other benefits from mommy like free babysitting \ud83c\udf1a", "NTA its your choice she should listen to you.

But that's an ancient custom true but today many folks have the ceremony well after they have introduced their baby to solids and the ceremony is just, well, a ritual and an excuse to load mom and baby with gifts. Many don't even bother with a ceremony.\nEdit: I Googled and saw that in most of the pics of this ceremony the kids are easily over a year old. Can't understand why your mom would want to feed a young baby solids. And your analogy with the body of Christ is wrong. The ceremony literally is known as \"feeding rice\" in Sanskrit.", "NTA cut her off completely from your child until she respects your boundaries whatever they are and despite her beliefs.\n\n\n What if she doesn't believe in allergies?
