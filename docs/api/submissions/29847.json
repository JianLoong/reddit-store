{"id": 29847, "submission_id": "17ibltm", "title": "AITA for expecting to live alone in a house me and my father built?", "selftext": "I came back from travelling 2 years ago and worked really hard to save \u00a3100k when I was away. I came back and visited my family after covid restrictions finally got better. I had to make a decision on going back or starting a life back home and a mortgage advisor confirmed I would be able to make a move on buying my first house.\n\nGetting bored over Christmas my father asked me to help him out. He has run a small engineering business as a sole trader for years. In the background he has had planning permission approved for a small 1 bedroom house to be built right next to his workshop. After talking with my father we came to a mutual decision that I could carry on working with him helping out, and between us we would build this house together. He owns the land and would pay for the build and I would then buy the house when it\u2019s finished. So my mind was made up.\n\nOver the course of this time I am now pretty much running my father\u2019s business. He has offered to sell the business to me for \u00a3100k. The business is currently turning over about \u00a390k a year and is struggling to find new business with it barely being profitable. I can see a possibility of making things better but almost all the equipment we use is on its last legs and a serious investment would need to be made. He is done! And will sell if I am not interested. But the close proximity to what will be my house is a real incentive for me to make things work and be my own boss. \n\n2 Years later the problem comes that my father has just told me a month away from finishing that he will be moving in with me Monday to Friday for at least a year as he is currently selling his other home. He will at the same time be looking for another plot of land to build his next home and build it. So the year of living with me, could be a very stretched out one. This house isn\u2019t big enough for 2 people and would mean that one of us is pretty much sleeping on the sofa. \n\nI haven\u2019t had the best of years mentally and he has played a huge negative part in that for me. So it was a real incentive for me knowing that I would be able to move into this house and start fresh and work on the business without him being there.\n\nHe now wants way more money for the house. I understand this is a lucky position to be in however I feel extremely tied up in my dad\u2019s web of how he wants things to work. He will have to underwrite my mortgage, pay him rent on the business premises that he owns, owe him \u00a3100k for a business that isn\u2019t doing that well and mess around paying him cash for a year in rent which won\u2019t help me when applying for a mortgage. It just makes me feel I will never get away.

Don't buy the house from him.  And start applying for jobs elsewhere.  You need housing and work that's independent of your father.", "NTA, walk away now.\n\nHe effectively talked you into buying the one bed house because the way he presented it, it would be a good deal for you.  Once you were sold on the idea he got you to invest valuable time making it a reality.  Then, only when you were deeply invested in the plan, did he reveal that his struggling business was up for sale, creating the 'dilemma'.  This was a long term strategy on his part to get himself out of a situation, and come out on top, on the back of your saved \u00a3100k.  You have been played.   He's relying on you only seeing it all through the lens of getting that house.  You need to get out of his plan.  No matter what, it will never benefit you as much as him.  The fact that he wants you to buy the house AFTER he has rented it to you for a year should be a clear indication of that.  He gets to have his cake and eat it in every which way.\n\nHowever, if he can buy a plot of land and build on it, so could you.  You could put one of those prefab tiny homes on it, while you build your property - then sell the tiny home as they have good resale value.\n\n(INFO: did he pay you a builder's wage for the house you helped him build?  If not, you should invoice him, and he has some gall asking for rent from you).", "NTA. \n\n\nA one bedroom house is literally the WORST kind of house to own or invest in. \n\n\nUse this moving of the needle on your Dad\u2019s part as an opportunity to escape this TERRIBLE idea. \n\n\nYour dad is serving himself here, not you. \n\n\nBranch out in your own and buy a proper home that someone might actually buy if you want to sell.", "NTA - your dad is changing the narrative as he goes along.  He has you by the short hairs,  knows it, and is exploiting it.", "Red flags everywhere. NTA but maybe walking away from the entire situation would be best for you. You see the issues with the business, you do deserve to live alone if you choose, and you're being wrangled into further financial obligation. The living situation is the least of this. Walk away.", "NTA and un-embroil yourself from this situation. Your father is taking advantage of you. Either you are buying this house and it is yours or you are not.\n\nThink carefully about the value of the business and get an independent assessment.", "NTA. \"Moving the goalposts\" - a.k.a Lying is not acceptable. You had an agreement and if it is changed, it is no longer valid.", "NTA - walk away from it. He\u2019s trying to sell you a business that isn\u2019t worth anything and charge you rent on the building to still support him, while using you to live rent free for a year. Then, you will still have a mortgage. \n\nIf you walk away, you will own your own home without the mortgage and not be in debt to him and the bank at the same time.", "Walk away. This sounds like a really bad deal for you.", "NTA\n\nI think your dad has forgotten he doesn\u2019t have all the power here. Without you buying the business and house, or even just one, he\u2019s fucked. \n\nStand your ground and make your demands or walk away entirely. This is dealbreaker, sneaky, back door behavior. Your dad is a massive Ah pulling that bait and switch! Smh", "NTA you're going to lose all your savings with your dad and his business and then he'll blame you for not being business savvy. I think you need to walk away now - or run preferably.", "go be your own man . leave it all behind . if you have the courage .", "NTA\n\nLook for other jobs, Don't buy  the house or the business. Tell your dad that he can find other housing. \n\nIt will greatly improve your state of mind if you get a job away from him AND  don't owe hime money for his house.

Best of luck!", "NTA He moved the goalposts. It sounds like a pretty one-sided proposition. I know you have already put a lot of time and money into this, but I think you need to cut your losses.", "NTA. You were snookered. My suggestion is salvage what you can financially and walk away. Walk away as fast as you can from this entanglement.", "NTA, but get to a lawyer, NOW! To find and recover anything dad owes you. Don't give dad another penny. Find your own place, move on with your life, not involving your dad.", "Don't do this. Get a job that your father isn't involved in. If you buy the house and business he'll never act like it's yours", "Just leave and let him sell all of it to someone else. Don't ruin yourself financially to keep this going.

Everything will blow over if you make sure the locks are  only you can open. Your dad is not going to find a plot of land , make a house and fix it enough to move in during winter in a year.

Apparently life together hasn't been a great time and now he want to extend that.  You might not have any legal claim on that house, so it could be that you are better off washing your hands of the whole thing and be grateful for the work experience, it will help you find a new route.", "Nta get his company apraised before making the move to buy it and also get the house done at the same time.", "NTA. You'll be the one sleeping on the couch every night. And it'll be years till you get him out. And it doesn't sound like he plans to contribute to bills, so he'll have no incentive to leave when he can leech off you.", "NTA- chalk up the labor as a gift to your dad and his aging and move on. Walk away. When you are not there to support the business or the home, he will need to make real decisions. He may come back to you a year from now and offer to sell the whole thing. Who knows? But let me ask you this, OP- are you hoping to find a partner? Get married? Raise a family? You can\u2019t do that in a one bedroom house that you share with your dad. I second the buy some land and put a tiny house on it. Make your own way.", "Let Dad move into the house that's next to the business, he may get more selling them as a package deal to someone, then he can find his own new place.
