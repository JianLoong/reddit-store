This means that I do have good days, but my bad days are becoming more and more frequent. On those days, the most I can do is sit up and maybe work on my computer.\n\nAlmost year ago, I moved to a different state for medical care and to get a job that would be flexible with when I go into the office. I am very lucky that I can work at home (thanks to my doctors note) whenever. All my work is on the computer and not physically taxing at all.\n\nA few days ago, I flew home to my hometown for the holidays. Travel can be extremely difficult for me, and I was exhausted and when I got to my parents\u2019 house around 9pm.  We had a nice conversation for about an hour, and then I said I needed to go to bed considering I would be working in the morning.  My mother listed all of the things that I would need to do first including wash the sheets from the last person who stayed there, clean the guest bathtub and toilet that hadn\u2019t been used most of the year, and unload my suitcase because she doesn\u2019t allow suitcases on the carpet.\n\nI was wiped out, so I took my clothes out of my suitcase, found a blanket that seemed clean, and fell asleep on top of the dirty sheets with it. In the morning, I did wash the sheets and bathroom.\n\nWhen my mom got back from her voluntary shift (she is retired, but sometimes her old job asks her to fill in as a favor,) she started getting frustrated because the \u201chouse is in shambles and people are coming for Christmas!\u201d By this, she means my 2 brothers who always show up the day of Christmas and leave shortly after and her brother.\n\nShe proceeded to give me a list of chores to complete. I explained to her that I was having a flare up and was exhausted by cleaning the bathroom but I could likely help tomorrow. She freaked out saying how she works so hard while the rest of us relax at home.  She proceeded to say that it\u2019s not fair I just come for Christmas and \u201cexpect to be waited on\u201d when I have a job and work all day \u201cjust fine.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m pretty used to this attitude from her, and it is why I don\u2019t visit too often. I tried explaining again about my chronic illness, but she continued make passive aggressive comments about how she will have to work on Christmas because nothing gets done. She told me in a rare sentimental moment in the past that she is in denial about my diagnosis. Ultimately, I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore and said that I would go to a hotel so she doesn\u2019t have to \u201cwait on me.\u201d\n\nStaying in a hotel isn\u2019t easy on me financially, but I did it anyways. My father called me explaining how upset I made my mother and that I need to apologize. Stress makes my illness worse, and right now all I can really do is lay here. However, I\u2019m wondering if I really should go back and apologize and try harder to do the chores, even if they physically hurt.

She is so very wrong.  She knew (I assume) that she was hosting Christmas this year.  She knew 365 days ago that Christmas would be coming up again.  She should have been cleaning her own home in preparation for visiting family.  It is NOT your responsibility to clean your parents' house for them.  No, they could have cleaned it a little at a time or hired someone to clean it for them.  Me personally, I would rest up and go back home.  I, too, have a condition that exhausts the hell out of me, and there is no way I would put up with that.  She should be apologizing to you for expecting you to clean her house for her.   Nope.  That is not how that works.", "NTA. Tell her to have your able  bodied brothers come do the chores. Then go home early. Or as soon as you are rested enough. I don't have a disability like yours, but i can absolutely attest to stress wreaking havoc on your body. She truly may have a hard time accepting your illness. But she doesn't get to increase your suffering by making you pretend you are able bodied. Especially after travelling.", "NTA  \nI am horrified quite frankly.  Not only could she not provide a welcoming environment for you (hello unsanitary and gross bed), but expects you to be her personal maid to make it welcoming for your brothers?!?  Stay in the hotel.  Go to Christmas when your brothers do, and leave when they do (or before, if they stay overnight).  You deserve better than being treated as a lessor human that your brothers.  And that's not even taking into account IN ANY WAY that you have a chronic illness.", "NTA- she\u2019s hosting. It\u2019s not your job to clean for her. The fact that she didn\u2019t even have a clean bed for you to sleep in is super gross. I\u2019d honestly rethink any more holiday visits. I\u2019d expect to help out, cook and what not but you\u2019re not a maid. Nor are you a child anymore so to expect to hand you a chore list is bonkers.", "NTA.  I'd also tell your mother to forget about you coming next Christmas.", "NTA my parents have a bad habit of picking my visits to throw big parties and have relatives over for visits. I finally called them out on it by pointing out that I travel father than all of their typical guests and yet have to wait on the others as if I didn\u2019t just work a full week, take care of a house by myself, and fly across the country while missing sleep. The rest? Drove maybe 40 minutes to come over. I think you made the right choice. Your family isn\u2019t going to look out for you which means you have to look out for yourself.", "NTA.   I actually didn't even need to read past the title.   Whatever the reason, do what is best for YOU.", "Thank you so much to everyone commenting. <3 I really thought this would be more controversial. You have relieved a lot a guilt.  I grew up watching my mom do chores for my grandmother, and I have always thought that was just expected of daughters, even if it wasn\u2019t fair.\n\nAfter reading everyone\u2019s advice, I think I will stay at the hotel and just go over when my brothers are there. I don\u2019t really have somewhere else to go for the holidays, but I can limit my time in stressful situations.", "NTA. Is staying in a hotel less expensive than going home early? Because this doesn't sound worthwhile at all, TBH. Your mother is a total asshole. It's not normal to feel entitled to this much help with the house, and you strongly imply she doesn't hold anyone else to those standards.", "I'm reading some internalised misogyny in your mother. Daughter has to do domestic chores, sons get waited on? Nope, that's not a good look. \n\nInvestigate the difference between staying in the hotel and going home earlier than already booked. And seriously consider just going home and resting instead of doing the whole Christmas thing.\n\nNTA, as if you didn't know already.", "NTA. People (in this case, your mother) seem to have a hard time understanding chronic illnesses \u2014 just because it\u2019s not visible doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there. You need to pace yourself to avoid getting worse. Your mother should be supportive of you, and she should want to learn about your disability to understand what you are going through. I don\u2019t know what the solution is, but I just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry that you aren\u2019t getting the support you deserve.", "NTA why is she concerned about YOU doing chores as a guest, yet not about what your brothers can do when THEY arrive? Do you also work for Merry Maids? \n\nHer denial of your diagnosis is something she needs to work out. But from now on, work the hotel into your budget, and never plan to overnight or play maid for them.", "NTA. \n\nYour mother could have hired help in advance if cleaning her own home was going to be so difficult. Instead she is trying to pawn off HER responsibility onto her disabled daughter. And she doesn\u2019t respect you enough to even acknowledge the diagnosis. \n\nYou\u2019d be well in your right to just go home.", "NTA it's nice enough that you're doing chores to help to begin with and she should appreciate that. I would stay at the hotel for sure if I was in your shoes.", "NTA. Maybe not maliciously, but your mom's kinda abusing the situation. My wife and I regularly stay at a nearby hotel when visiting her parents and mine even though we grew up in our respective houses. It's really easier on everyone. It's no big deal.", "NTA. I'm sorry your mom is so shitty. You've done nothing wrong. You are an adult. She pulled a power move and now she's pissed that she can't control you. That's her problem to deal with. You're not well and I think you'd be better served by turning off your phone, get some tasty food and spending Christmas in your hotel resting in anticipation of your flight home. Spend your future holidays at home with friends.", "So NTA! You\u2019re a guest in her home. Why are you expected to clean anything? And wash the dirty sheets?? That should\u2019ve been done when the last guest left. I\u2019m sorry that your mom treats you like that.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you don't feel well, and I'm proud of you for protecting your physical and mental health by getting that hotel. I'm sorry your mom is in denial and being unkind.", "Nta so is there some reason your dad couldn't help?  His house too. Not your house. Not your job.", "I\u2019m in the middle of a flare too and I can barely get off the bed and my bones are killing me. I\u2019m grateful all the kids are doing Christmas at their houses and we will just meet up to exchange gifts. Your mother is wanting you to come home and get her place ready.

Has he always just swept what your mom does under the rug?", "Also, who knows someone is coming to stay with them and doesn't provide a clean place for that person to sleep? WTF?!  Granted, my mom doesn't change the sheets every single time I come visit, but that's because nobody else ever stays with her. \n\nAnd even if you *were* going to make a guest change their own sheets, why would you wait until 10 pm to let them know? That means they can't possibly go to bed until midnight or so. Rude AF.\n\nAnd even if your mom is too busy to clean up, did somebody break all four of your dad's limbs that he can't his own damn house?", "OP, If it were ANYONE ELSE staying with your parents, your mom would have had clean sheets and a clean bathroom for them.\n\nIt seems she has a real hang-up about your health issues. Maybe if she acknowledges it's real, she will feel guilty about you having it (is it genetic?) or that she didn't get you help when you were younger, etc. Maybe she just really resents the idea that you can have  a set-up that is less physically demanding of you. It doesn't have to make total sense to you for it to be a very real driver for her.\n\nShe is going to treat you that way every time. She's happy to expect nothing from your brothers. If you show up the 'day of' like they do... and disappear quickly like the do; she'll probably still complain... But it will be harder for her to complain about you specifically. You would be doing the same thing as your brothers.\n\nI'm sorry that your love for your mom (and dad) is not as fully reciprocated. I think you may find it helpful to talk with a counselor. That person may help recognize your parents' shortcomings and realize that those things are not your fault. And help you find ways to both love them and also respect and protect yourself from those shortcomings.\n\nWishing you well for this visit and for the long term.", "I am going to be blunt.  I am able bodied.  And if anyone told me to change the bed and clean a bathtub when they are hosting and I am wiped from a flight?  My ass would be back at the airport so fast booking a flight back home that there would be a visible redshift about me.", "Exactly. I didn't think to word the difference that way."]}
