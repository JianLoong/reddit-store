This means that I do have good days, but my bad days are becoming more and more frequent. On those days, the most I can do is sit up and maybe work on my computer.\n\nAlmost year ago, I moved to a different state for medical care and to get a job that would be flexible with when I go into the office. I am very lucky that I can work at home (thanks to my doctors note) whenever. All my work is on the computer and not physically taxing at all.\n\nA few days ago, I flew home to my hometown for the holidays. Travel can be extremely difficult for me, and I was exhausted and when I got to my parents\u2019 house around 9pm.  We had a nice conversation for about an hour, and then I said I needed to go to bed considering I would be working in the morning.  My mother listed all of the things that I would need to do first including wash the sheets from the last person who stayed there, clean the guest bathtub and toilet that hadn\u2019t been used most of the year, and unload my suitcase because she doesn\u2019t allow suitcases on the carpet.\n\nI was wiped out, so I took my clothes out of my suitcase, found a blanket that seemed clean, and fell asleep on top of the dirty sheets with it. In the morning, I did wash the sheets and bathroom.\n\nWhen my mom got back from her voluntary shift (she is retired, but sometimes her old job asks her to fill in as a favor,) she started getting frustrated because the \u201chouse is in shambles and people are coming for Christmas!\u201d By this, she means my 2 brothers who always show up the day of Christmas and leave shortly after and her brother.\n\nShe proceeded to give me a list of chores to complete. I explained to her that I was having a flare up and was exhausted by cleaning the bathroom but I could likely help tomorrow. She freaked out saying how she works so hard while the rest of us relax at home.  She proceeded to say that it\u2019s not fair I just come for Christmas and \u201cexpect to be waited on\u201d when I have a job and work all day \u201cjust fine.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m pretty used to this attitude from her, and it is why I don\u2019t visit too often. I tried explaining again about my chronic illness, but she continued make passive aggressive comments about how she will have to work on Christmas because nothing gets done. She told me in a rare sentimental moment in the past that she is in denial about my diagnosis. Ultimately, I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore and said that I would go to a hotel so she doesn\u2019t have to \u201cwait on me.\u201d\n\nStaying in a hotel isn\u2019t easy on me financially, but I did it anyways. My father called me explaining how upset I made my mother and that I need to apologize. Stress makes my illness worse, and right now all I can really do is lay here. However, I\u2019m wondering if I really should go back and apologize and try harder to do the chores, even if they physically hurt. I do love her and want to help, it can just be really hard for me.", "created_utc": 1703300423, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ow20v/aita_for_staying_at_a_hotel_instead_of_my_parents/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is so very wrong.  She knew (I assume) that she was hosting Christmas this year.  She knew 365 days ago that Christmas would be coming up again.  She should have been cleaning her own home in preparation for visiting family.  It is NOT your responsibility to clean your parents' house for them.  No, they could have cleaned it a little at a time or hired someone to clean it for them.  Me personally, I would rest up and go back home.  I, too, have a condition that exhausts the hell out of me, and there is no way I would put up with that.  She should be apologizing to you for expecting you to clean her house for her.   Nope.  That is not how that works.", "NTA. Tell her to have your able  bodied brothers come do the chores. Then go home early. Or as soon as you are rested enough. I don't have a disability like yours, but i can absolutely attest to stress wreaking havoc on your body. She truly may have a hard time accepting your illness. But she doesn't get to increase your suffering by making you pretend you are able bodied. Especially after travelling.", "NTA  \nI am horrified quite frankly.  Not only could she not provide a welcoming environment for you (hello unsanitary and gross bed), but expects you to be her personal maid to make it welcoming for your brothers?!?  Stay in the hotel.  Go to Christmas when your brothers do, and leave when they do (or before, if they stay overnight).  You deserve better than being treated as a lessor human that your brothers.  And that's not even taking into account IN ANY WAY that you have a chronic illness.", "NTA- she\u2019s hosting. It\u2019s not your job to clean for her. The fact that she didn\u2019t even have a clean bed for you to sleep in is super gross. I\u2019d honestly rethink any more holiday visits. I\u2019d expect to help out, cook and what not but you\u2019re not a maid. Nor are you a child anymore so to expect to hand you a chore list is bonkers.", "NTA.  I'd also tell your mother to forget about you coming next Christmas.", "NTA my parents have a bad habit of picking my visits to throw big parties and have relatives over for visits. I finally called them out on it by pointing out that I travel father than all of their typical guests and yet have to wait on the others as if I didn\u2019t just work a full week, take care of a house by myself, and fly across the country while missing sleep. The rest? Drove maybe 40 minutes to come over. I think you made the right choice. Your family isn\u2019t going to look out for you which means you have to look out for yourself.", "NTA.   I actually didn't even need to read past the title.   Whatever the reason, do what is best for YOU.", "Thank you so much to everyone commenting. <3 I really thought this would be more controversial. You have relieved a lot a guilt.  I grew up watching my mom do chores for my grandmother, and I have always thought that was just expected of daughters, even if it wasn\u2019t fair.\n\nAfter reading everyone\u2019s advice, I think I will stay at the hotel and just go over when my brothers are there. I don\u2019t really have somewhere else to go for the holidays, but I can limit my time in stressful situations.", "NTA. Is staying in a hotel less expensive than going home early? Because this doesn't sound worthwhile at all, TBH. Your mother is a total asshole. It's not normal to feel entitled to this much help with the house, and you strongly imply she doesn't hold anyone else to those standards.", "I'm reading some internalised misogyny in your mother. Daughter has to do domestic chores, sons get waited on? Nope, that's not a good look. \n\nInvestigate the difference between staying in the hotel and going home earlier than already booked. And seriously consider just going home and resting instead of doing the whole Christmas thing.\n\nNTA, as if you didn't know already.", "NTA. People (in this case, your mother) seem to have a hard time understanding chronic illnesses \u2014 just because it\u2019s not visible doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there. You need to pace yourself to avoid getting worse. Your mother should be supportive of you, and she should want to learn about your disability to understand what you are going through. I don\u2019t know what the solution is, but I just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry that you aren\u2019t getting the support you deserve.", "NTA why is she concerned about YOU doing chores as a guest, yet not about what your brothers can do when THEY arrive? Do you also work for Merry Maids? \n\nHer denial of your diagnosis is something she needs to work out. But from now on, work the hotel into your budget, and never plan to overnight or play maid for them.", "NTA. \n\nYour mother could have hired help in advance if cleaning her own home was going to be so difficult. Instead she is trying to pawn off HER responsibility onto her disabled daughter. And she doesn\u2019t respect you enough to even acknowledge the diagnosis. \n\nYou\u2019d be well in your right to just go home.", "NTA it's nice enough that you're doing chores to help to begin with and she should appreciate that. I would stay at the hotel for sure if I was in your shoes.", "NTA. Maybe not maliciously, but your mom's kinda abusing the situation. My wife and I regularly stay at a nearby hotel when visiting her parents and mine even though we grew up in our respective houses. It's really easier on everyone. It's no big deal.", "NTA. I'm sorry your mom is so shitty. You've done nothing wrong. You are an adult. She pulled a power move and now she's pissed that she can't control you. That's her problem to deal with. You're not well and I think you'd be better served by turning off your phone, get some tasty food and spending Christmas in your hotel resting in anticipation of your flight home. Spend your future holidays at home with friends.", "So NTA! You\u2019re a guest in her home. Why are you expected to clean anything? And wash the dirty sheets?? That should\u2019ve been done when the last guest left. I\u2019m sorry that your mom treats you like that.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you don't feel well, and I'm proud of you for protecting your physical and mental health by getting that hotel. I'm sorry your mom is in denial and being unkind.", "Nta so is there some reason your dad couldn't help?  His house too. Not your house. Not your job.", "I\u2019m in the middle of a flare too and I can barely get off the bed and my bones are killing me. I\u2019m grateful all the kids are doing Christmas at their houses and we will just meet up to exchange gifts. Your mother is wanting you to come home and get her place ready. It\u2019s simply not your job. Perhaps when you return next time, plan on the motel and then you can meet up when the family meets up. Hopefully you get the energy to participate", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I'm just grossed out at the thought that you were expected to wash and change the bed linens and scrub the toilets from the last guests to use the room.

Your mother is not only in denial about your diagnosis, she's in denial that you are an adult who doesn't live there anymore. She's responsible for her home, not you!  Good for you for going to a hotel.

I get being alone at the holidays for setting boundaries can be hard but it can be good for you. I went NC with my toxic family and yes that means major holidays I mostly spend alone.

No day is worth celebrating if it causing your pain. HUGS!!!!", "You can't blame them then haha. But they have learned to say no it seems.\n\nAnd I had a mom more like yours. Couldn't really be bothered with going to trouble for me. When my grown kids come to stay, i go all out. Comfortable guest room WITH fresh streets, towels etc. Clean bathroom. Favorite food and drinks stocked up, etc. \n\nYears ago when we visited his mother's home, he spent the whole time doing errands and home repairs for her. Not little, let me help with that type things. But replace the kitchen plumbing type things. And she was better off financially than we were and could have well afforded a plumber. I hated this so much i vowed to never do it to my kids. \n\nYour mom is able to work. She's obviously not so old she can't put fresh sheets on your bed. You deserve to be treated right.
