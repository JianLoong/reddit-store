It already had that name.\n\n- You aren't addressing your sister by the name Charlie.\n\nI see this as a total coincidence that the cat was originally named your sister's dead name, and if the cat is used to that name, I don't see why the cat should be in a confusing scenario of learning to respond to a new name.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What is she going to do when she bumps into humans named Charlie? You didn't name the cat, and it will probably be confusing to the cat if you changed his name now.

She could have easily taken you aside and said something along the lines of \"You know, I'm really uncomfortable with my deadname and was wondering if you'd be willing to change the cat's name.\" Her reaction of jumping to anger and accusations was inappropriate and indicates she probably has some triggers that she needs to work through regarding this.", "I don\u2019t think keeping your cat\u2019s name is in any way an AH move.

Your sister bends to understand she will run into that name", "Yeah this basically sums up why the conservative view point is to dismiss trans identities.\n\nNTA. Your sister is the only one responsible for her triggers and by being a crybaby is only weakening her cause.", "NTA. The cat\u2019s name is not about her.

When I heard this I said, hey, that's my cats name.  So wife sort of gets a frown on her face and asks me how long I've had my cat.  I said about a year and a half.  I then asked her how long have you had your baby?  Because, you know, I always have to be a smart ass.  She just kind of laughed because she knows me and my (bad) sense of humor.  I think she was really just kind of humoring me.  This was never mentioned again.", "Info: does your sister know he had the name before or does she think you have a new cat you bought her dead name? Because if she knows that I can understand how that might be uncomfortable for her but you didn\u2019t name him and he\u2019s already used to the name so there\u2019s not much you can do.\n\nBut it sounds like you told her you chose the name and if that\u2019s the case I understand why she\u2019s upset. \n\n\u201cOut of all the names why did my sibling their cat the one name that hurts me?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably what they are thinking.

Maybe refer to the cat as \u201cchuck\u201d or some other (unrelated to her) nickname around family?", "NTA. That\u2019s pretty selfish and annoying thinking of your sister.

And you didn\u2019t name the cat to hurt your sister.", "NTA. You can't just be upset every time you hear a name just because it's something you struggle with personally.  Is she just going to go around not letting anyone use that name ever again in case she sees their pet once or twice in the future?

You didn't do anything wrong, and Charlie is a cute ass name for a cat.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t name the cat it was quite common for people to not change their pets name when they adopt them. You live faraway enough from your family that this really shouldn\u2019t be a big issue.

Does she also demand the people named Charlie change their names?\n\nHad she explained to you the sensitivity of the nature, then sure it would be nice to rename the cat. But immediately yelling? Hell no.", "NTA. Name your cat what you want.", "NTA. You didn't name him, he came with that name.", "NTA - only actually question your sister should\u2019ve asked if naming the cat \u201cCharlie\u201d was a direct insult to them.  No?

Enjoy the cat as he will not judge, care and just wants love and treats.", "NTA, what is OP supposed to do, find every person and animal named Charlie and demand they change it.", "NTA. Charlie is not an offensive name, your sister just thinks that Charlie is an offensive name.", "NTA. I get the hormonal changes and all of that stuff but here's the thing...it's a friggin NAME. Maybe your sister shouldn't be so sensitive and understand that just because she considers it HER deadname, does not mean that the name is dead for the rest of the world, and she will continually meet people AND animals named Charlie. This seems more like a \"her\" problem than a \"you\" problem. But most of the time animals tend to just recognize words or sounds that seem familiar. So, if you want to reach a compromise perhaps changing his name to something that sounds similar but isn't the same. Harley, Farlie, Marley...hell, maybe a more foreign name? \n\nIf you just want to be petty, (which is my favorite road to travel) Keep it the same and tell her to grow tf up and realize that just because she decided to be someone else, doesn't mean the rest of the world is going to change to make her more comfortable.", "NTA - your sister needs to realize she isn\u2019t the main character and the world doesn\u2019t evolve around her.", "NTA.

Tell her to calm down.", "NTA", "I might be biased because I literally renamed my spouse's cat on our first date, but I really don't think that renaming a cat is that big of a deal or that troublesome to them. Additionally, literally every cat we've ever adopted from a shelter has had a \"please let us know what you rename them, if you choose to do so\" as part of their social media thing so, again, even for older cats being renamed isn't so weird.\n\nThat is not to say that you're being an AH; you're NTA here. But I do think that your instinct to defend your cat's name on that basis rather than empathize with your sister probably escalated the conflict, because when you give a poor justification for an action that hurts others, it can make it sting worse even if you are in the right.", "Nta", "NTA my mum spent so long picking a name for our cat it wouldn\u2019t respond to it", "INFO: Which do you care about more, your cat's name or your sister's feelings? No objective harm will come to either of them through this, so that's really what it comes down to. It would be a no-brainer for me.", "Lightly NTA. As a trans person I can certainly relate to how she feels, albeit I wouldn't exclaim my deadname being \"offensive\" to me. Most certainly you could have considered your choices of names, eg if my siblings had a child and named them after my deadname I would be pretty annoyed because I would struggle coming in contact with them (the children). We trans folk hate our deadnames for a reason, it's a memory of our struggling and torturous past. Does that mean you HAVE to avoid using that name unrelated to her? No, of course not, but I would advise to be more careful with the said deadname around her for reasons I've already said.", "NAH: Given how old the cat was when you picked him up, I can't blame you for not changing the name. I also see where your sister is coming from, that can be really triggering. You probably should've warned her in some way.", "yeah YTA, come on have some compassion for your sister. I know that the name Charlie exists and she has to accept that in the world, but her family shouldn't be one of the places she has to encounter it.", "NTA. Call him Gnarly lol.", "Info: Did you warn your sister about the cat's name in advance? As in, before she got to your place.", "NTA, but you need to consider repercussions to not renaming Charlie, and how it will affect your relationship with your sister.  \n\nNow, your sister and mom sound dramatic as is written, this is true. But I think you're lying to yourself if you can't see how your sister could be hurt by this.  Do I think it's a bit of an overreaction? Sure, but we all have our struggles and I haven't walked your sister's path so it's not my place to judge her.  She's not at the point in her life and her transition to be emotionally comfortable with her deadname, and that's okay.  \n\nYou like your cat's name and don't want to change it. I don't blame you, Charlie is cute AF for a cat.  I didn't change my cat's name when she was adopted, I too am lazy. \n\nBut now you're stuck with a cat whose name makes a presumably beloved sister feel hurt.  \n\nBecause you love your sister, you can make this small sacrifice for her.  It's much lower stakes for you than her, surely you can see that.  You don't have to fully rename him -- my cat has 145622456 different stupid nicknames.  Pick one and lean into it hard whenever your sister is around. He can still be Charlie to you.", "I'm going to go with YTA here for a couple of reasons. One, people who are anti-trans often use someone's deadname aggressively to devalue them. Even if that wasn't your intention, that doesn't mean that keeping the cat's name when it coincides with her deadname doesn't feel like a micro (or macro)aggression. Two, I'm going to assume that you talk to your sister and may happen to mention what your adorbs cat is doing? Or post on social media forums with updates and pictures of your adorbs cat? If so, that's putting her deadname in her face constantly and also probably looks kind of shitty from an outside perspective. Three, imagine your sister had a beloved spouse name Charlie who died. Wouldn't you feel kind of weird rocking up with your cat and being like \"Hey, here's Charlie. Same name as your dead spouse and hearing that name causes you lots of emotional pain, but it's no biggie, right?\"\n\nIf you're never going to post updates, pics, etc., on a social media platform you share with your sister and if you're never going to mention anything about your cat when you talk to her or at family gatherings, then maybe it'd be slightly different? But, come on - the cat is not going to care if you change its name. You didn't pick the name so it's not like you have some deep, emotional connection to the name. Give little Chuck another name. Call it out when you feed him. It won't be long before he's happily arriving to accept dinner under whatever name you want to call him.\n\nThis sub isn't \"will you be morally incorrect if you keep your cat's name\". It's will you be an AH, and yeah, given this unique confluence of factors, you kind of would be.", "look you didn't name the cat charlie so yea not the ah but you didn't change probably a bad move but not an ah one, but your family didn't know you didn't name the cat so look at it like this:\n\nyour sister thinks you named the cat with her deadname, she's allowed to be upset because there is a difference between encountering someone else with that name (if that were the case then her reaction would be inappropriate) and your sibling purposefully naming their pet with that name \n\nso while you aren't the asshole tbh neither is she on the other hand I probably would have mentioned it to her beforehand instead of waiting\n\n\nabout changing the cat's name I get it I do on both sides but depending on how old the cat is and how long he's been named charlie, it probably would be hard to get him used to a different one but maybe try to compromise like at the very least don't talk about the cat by name at least to/around your sister for example \"my cat knocked over a glass the other day\" \n\nneither of you are the assholes deadnames can be triggering and you didn't purposefully name the cat with the deadname, honestly try to talk to her but don't blame her for being upset and don't blame yourself for this too much like i said you probably could have told her or maybe have considered just a little bit about changing the name but it doesn't make you the ah especially since she's not gonna see it that often", "Might be unpopular but YTA. I\u2019m not trans but I did change my name due to childhood trauma. Hearing my deadname (yes, deadname still applies when you aren\u2019t trans) sends nasty feelings all over my body. Yes I have to hear it in the world, and I would never make that someone else\u2019s issue. But if someone close to me named their animal my deadname I would be heartbroken. There\u2019s a difference between \u201cyou\u2019ll have to hear it and you need to be able to cope\u201d and \u201cyou should be okay with your family throwing it around like it\u2019s nothing.\u201d \n\nI understand the cat came with the name, but choosing to keep your sisters deadname when it\u2019s already hard enough being trans is just awful and thoughtless.

I feel bad for your sister.", "How could you not notice the cat had the former name of your sister?\n\nI don't think you need to change your cat's name since it was already his before.\n\nBut imagine: you went through the struggle and pain of changing gender and name, and your own brother shows up with a cat carrying your old name?\n\nYTA", "Yeah I'm sorry.

Maybe in time, she won't associate that name with negative memories. But she's not there yet.  She can't control hearing it in the wide world, and she can't control your choice to name your cat. But you have the choice to be empathetic to her feelings. You have the choice to say, \"I didn't know this would cause you pain, but now that I see it does, I don't want to continue doing that.\" As others have stated, Charlie is one of millions of names. You could easily choose another, and you can train your cat to respond to it.", "INFO: did it ever occur to you that keeping the name Charlie might hurt your sister?\n\nThe fact that you feel guilty tells me that you knew this name might upset her. She may feel as if you don\u2019t give a shit about her as a caring sibling might have gone to the extent of changing the name EVEN if you didn\u2019t initally name the cat, EVEN if the cat is three years old. \n\nThere are countless cute kitty-names out there. You could have chosen one that wasn\u2019t your own sister\u2019s deadname. I\u2019d do it for my own sister no question about it, but perhaps you\u2019re not close and perhaps you don\u2019t care.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA\n\nDeadnames can have a lot of trauma associated with them. I get liking a cat's name, but most cats can get used to a new name with little trouble. Your sister needs your support.", "Yes YTA. You knew this cat had your sisters deadname. Do you really think your sister is gonna be happy and chill hearing the one name she never wants to be called when she\u2019s around? No. Most of these commenters aren\u2019t trans or know trans people, if they did, they would have more empathy.  You\u2019re technically right that you can do it, but morally wrong. You want to put your sister in an uncomfortable position?", "YTA - renaming animals really isn't a big deal, I barely call my let's by their names but instead their nicknames. It is still your choice to keep the cat name but you are an asshole for not warning your sister. It quite an asshole move to not care about it. Deadnames are complicated and bring up uncomfortable feelings at minimum. It's one thing when a human has your dead name, that you deal but an animal, who literally doesn't actually know it name in same way, it more about the tone and inflection you use when talking to them, that's not as easy to deal with especially if you could of warned the person. Or if you know the person, and haven't check if that cause harm first, then it just comes across as you don't care at the very least", "The transphobia in this thread is amazing.
