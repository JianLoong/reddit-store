It's like the only real time I have with my dad because, while Sam is not as bitchy as some I've read here, she really likes to demand both my grandad and dad's attention and since they consider me ''tomboy-ish'' they kinda ignore me to coddle her which sucks.\n\nMy dad asked me around my 10th  birthday if he could invite Sam and I said no. I've been saying no ever since and while he doesn't like it, he respects it, he does other stuff with her without me and I don't complain. This year, however, Sam is very adamant on going and I just don't want to, my dad is pressuring me to let her come as well as Dora,  while my aunt and grandma are insisting he just leaves this thing untouched between us but my dad doesn't want to hurt ''his little girl's feelings''. \n\nNGL, that stung o I said that if he really wants her there, then he doesn't have to pick me up for Christmas this year and to just leave me be.

You're not asking her to be excluded from everything. You just want this one special tradition to remain untouched.\n\nMaybe remind your dad that because they have him full time, and you only have him half the time, they already have moments with him dedicated just to them. Why don't you also deserve that level of focus from him?\n\nI hope you can find a compromise that leaves you feeling cared for.", "NTA.  Your father is TA.  His wife and her daughter are likewise TA.  As represented, this has been, for your entire life a you-dad thing.  Your father is willing to surrender this last activity to pacify his wife and the child he provides care to 24/7/365, while only taking care of you 2 days/week + summer.  Clearly you understandably feel pushed out as his only daughter in favor of someone he has not, apparently, adopted.  You understandably treasure what little father-daughter time you can get, but he wants to destroy that.  I\u2019m sorry your father seems to have put you in second place rather than at least equal to his wife\u2019s daughter.  He is a major AH.  I would not be surprised if, after reaching the age of maturity, you cut contact with him.  He will lose any remaining father/daughter traditions with you, in favor of his wife\u2019s daughter, like walking you down the aisle.  Fortunately, your mom is there.", "I hate that you have to teach your dad how to make you feel like a priority. In this instance because of the other multiple family members involved, it makes it harder for him to say no to them and yes to you because you are outnumbered, and because it is in the middle of a holiday gathering. If it were an activity that just you and Dad did, he wouldn't likely consider letting others be involved.  Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to understand how having one solo event a year is very important. I came from a huge family, and my parents also didn't make alone time a priority - unless it was their favorite. \n\nNTA, but I think that you need to talk to Dad this week without threatening to not see him and while trying to contain your frustration/anger. It is possible that he is not well schooled in parenting a teenaged daughter. And if he doesn't seem to get it, tell him an Internet Stranger is worried that you will have daddy issues later in life and end up only dating married men at least a decade older. A joke like that would have completely shocked my dad, and likely would yours too, but it would also give him something to consider.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. I think simply because not only did he refer to his stepdaughter as his \"little girl\" when she's NOT his biological daughter and you are.\n\n>since and while he doesn't like it, he respects it, he does other stuff with her without me and I don't complain. \n\nPlus it sounds like they do a lot of stuff together without you and you never complain, so I feel they don't have a right to pressure you to let them join when you've never pressured them to let you join their bonding time. \n\n>this is the only real thing I have with my dad,\n\nYou also said she LIVES with him, she's basically his kid. You only see him four times a week. She sees him every day, he should be trying to run away from her not pressure you to bring her. It's not your fault you have a dad and she doesn't. She sounds like a living centipede. And shame on your grandparents for not paying attention to you and coddling someone who refuses to join the activity", "NTA. Your father lives with Sam, she can have him any other day of the week.  Dora and Sam are both being greedy with your dad's attention. \n\nI would sit with him and explain to him exactly how you feel. If he can't respect that then you know exactly where he stands and it's up to you If you want to spend Christmas with him or not.", "NTA.  It is very clear that out of everything that this was the one special thing with your dad.  Your step mother should have been adult enough to not get involved and your dad should have respected you just wanting this one thing with him.  Your step sister should have been fully shut down on this instead of being an entitled pain.  Good parenting by your dad destroying his relationship with you.", "I find this so sad.  I'm sorry you are dealing with this.  NTA.  I'd let him know what you said here or even show him this because you articulated your feelings really well.  Sam is replacing you and this guy is your biological father who is supposed to love you and want to spend time with you one on one.  It also sounds like he's favoring her.  I'm absolutely not suggesting this, but I know my own personality and that would be more than enough for me just letting him go.  If my dad couldn't make me a priority, he's not worth it to me.  Again, I'm not suggesting that.  I just know how defeated this would make me feel.  Much love to you.", "NTA and I'm disappointed that your dad doesn't respect your feelings. It's great that he's close to Sam but you already have limited time with him. I think you have every right to expect him to keep one thing for just the 2 of you.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nMan, that is beyond rude.\n\nSo your his biological daughter, the youngest & yet he refers to her as his little girl??\n\nHave one last treasure hunt with him & slip in some passive aggressive notes into the clues.  End it with one that says you are done with your visits to him until he removes his head from somewhere & realises how much he is hurting his own daughter.", "\u201cDad, your little girl is right here, and your repeated asking is hurting MY feelings.\u201d\n\nUnless\u2026how uninvolved is Sam\u2019s dad? Have you ever met him? Has your mum? Is it possible that your dad and Dora\u2019s quick marriage was because he had something going on before either of you were born and your mum found out about it when you were three? Is it possible you really are hurting your dad\u2019s little girl\u2019s feelings and it was a Freudian slip?\n\nAnd\u2026it looks like my gummy just kicked in.\n\nAlso, NTA", "NTA. You should explain everything you\u2019ve said here to your father.

I\u2019m just really, really sorry OP.", "NTA. You're allowed to (and deserve to) have a special thing that's just between you and your dad. He probably doesn't realize how special this time really is to you. I would have a sit down with him (no stepmom or step sister around).", "NTA. Your dad has failed to make you a priority 99% of the time and now the last 1% he wants to take that from you too? He needs to know the risk of losing you, both visitation and contact. Have you talked to him before about feeling like you never spend one on one time just you & him, outside of this one activity? Sounds like grandma and your aunt know how it is.", "NTA - Even if she was your Bio sibling, you still should have one on one time with your parents.  My daughter does certain things with me and has dad daughter activities.", "NTA. You're being replaced. It stings but at least he has shown his true colors. WHen someone shows you how little you mean to them, believe them. \n\n I'd never spend another minute with him unless forced, and even then I wouldn't even look his way. If he wants his \"little girl\" so bad let him have her. You don't have to be some after thought while your dad plays stepdad with his fake daughter.", "Definitely NTA. I really hope your dad sees sense here. You really are not in TA for wanting to have this activity with your dad. Your dad has respected your decision for so long and it seems twisted he is now trying to force you to give up this alone time with him during this tradition. Stay strong!", "NTA.\n\nSam isn't your sister and you are allowed to have your own traditions with your dad.  She can make her own traditions with him.  They are being a bit lazy and entitled to think that they can and should hone in on your time with your father.\n\nYour dad is a pushover for not emphatically telling them no.  I'd pass on participating if the tradition changes without your consent.", "NTA", "You should get a trip with your dad.\n\nBut if he truly loves her as his own, he should take a trip with her w/o you.\n\nYou both can get time fairly", "NTA the little bit of time you get with your dad is precious to you. I can't imagine how much it must have hurt when he referred to Sam as his little girl and not wanting to hurt her. Obviously he is okay with hurting your feelings. Dad is the TA. Dora is the TA. Sam is the TA. \nIt strikes me that the Steps don't want you to have a close, unique, and special relationship with your dad.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry this happened. A good father knows that it is important to spend quality alone time with each child. There should be a special event/tradition with each child. The treasure hunt is your tradition with your dad, granddad, and aunt. If he wants that with his stepdaughter, then he needs to create a tradition for her. That is his failure. \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to hurt \u2018his little girl\u2019s feelings\u2019.\u201d My heart dropped when I read that. That is just blatant favoritism. I don\u2019t blame you for skipping Christmas with them. I don\u2019t know if it is possible for your dad to ever repair the damage. \n\nAlso, shame on both your dad and granddad for coddling her. That\u2019s how spoiled kids are created. And that is precisely what Sam is turning into. \n\nI agree with other posters that you share this post with your dad. I\u2019d also suggest you share it with your granddad too. I hope they are both hang their heads in shame.", "Nta this is the one thing you and your dad do together. It\u2019s time you talk to your mom. Let her know how your dad and his family treat you.BUT YOU ARENOT SELFISH FOR WANTING THIS TRADTION TO STAY BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU", "Nta. Please sit your dad down with this thread and make him read it.\n\nHe needs a clue-by-four wake up call.\n\nHe can keep this activity for you.", "Please show this post to your father. I think it will help him understand how much he is hurting you.", "She's trying to overstep you being his daughter it's a power-play to see if she can get what she wants.

That should be a regular ongoing thing not an annual event.\n\nFrom his perspective, he doesn't want to exclude his step-child from a family celebration at Christmas. It is good that he wants to be a decent step-parent, we have heard a lot of stories about bad ones on this sub-reddit.\n\nHow are you communicating your feelings to your dad?

I'd say something like this:\n\n\"Dad,\n\nI have been trying to figure out how to get you to understand my feelings, but you just don't want to seem to hear me, so I thought I'd try a letter instead. \n\nSince you and Mum divorced, I have only gotten to have a dad part-time. You married Dora and made Sam your daughter, and that's fine, neither you nor they seem to understand that whilst Sam's biological dad isn't around, she does get to have a dad all the time. She gets to have you, whilst I only have a part-time dad. Now you and they are demanding that I sacrifice the one thing that is between just you and I, and you're all trying to make me feel terrible for not wanting to do so. \n\nIt seems like you've been working so hard to compensate for Sam's biological dad not being present that you've forgotten about me. You're my biological dad, the only one I have, and yet I don't feel like I'm important to you, or like I'm part of your family. You, Sam, and Dora have your inside jokes and all of these things that involve just the three of you because you're together all of the time, and I'm left feeling like an intruder. \n\nYou constantly put Sam ahead of me. Because Sam doesn't have her dad around, you place her feelings ahead of mine, and you coddle her. Yes, she needs a dad, but so do I, and you've been so busy with her that I feel like an afterthought. \n\nWith the Christmas tradition, I just wanted one thing with you, but you won't allow it. It took me saying that I didn't want to see you over Christmas for you to consider my feelings, but it is too little, too late. \n\nI do not want to hear from you for a while. I need to space to figure out what will be the best thing for me to do, because you clearly are never going to consider what is best for me or our relationship if it might in any way upset Dora and Sam, and Dora and Sam are only invested in making sure that Sam has a father-daughter relationship with you even if it harms your relationship with me. \n\nI also do not want to hear from Sam and Dora, who have both been trying to guilt and shame me over this. To Dora, your daughter is always included. She lives with dad, and the three of you get to be together every day of the year. The fact that you want to make me feel bad about my wanting one single thing with my dad that is just between us shows that whilst you want dad to treat Sam the same way that he treats me, you will never treat me the same as Sam. \n\nAnd to Sam, you feel excluded from one tradition, the one thing I have with my dad. Imagine feeling excluded every single time you visit. You cannot let me have this one thing, and why? You might not have your biological dad, but you do have my dad all the time. He always chooses you and puts you first, and now you want to take away the only thing I ever get that is just he and I. You want to call me selfish because I won't give you the one thing I have with my dad that you don't.\n\nI doubt the three of you will care about what I have to say. None of you can see that in trying to make sure Sam has a dad and feels loved, you've taken my dad from me and made me feel unwanted and unloved. Dad, you loudly said you didn't want to hurt your little girl's feelings, but you have no problem hurting me. You've made it clear that Sam is your child, and I am not. So I won't be visiting for a while, and until I decide what I want to do, I want you, Dora, and Sam to give me space. If you or they harass me in any way, I will block you all. I will not be made to feel guilty for wanting one day that is just my dad and I, and I should not be made to feel like an intruder in my dad's life, so any attempts to guilt, shame, or harass me into changing my mind or doing what you want instead of what I need will only increase the amount of time I need away from you all.\n\nOP.\"", "Why don't you try talking to the rest of the family members you do the treasure hunt with and do it with them?

Have him read the letter than talk to him so all your pertinent points get made and nothing important gets lost in the emotions or frustration of the conversation. Give him a chance to see that his actions are wrong and change them. He probably doesn't quite realize how wrong it is because he hears Sam's opinions on it all week - that she wants to go and you are being mean for not letting her, etc and I am not sure that you have tried talking to him about it other than saying \"No\" each time he cluelessly asks if Sam can come along this year. \n\nWhy just give him to Sam totally, that is exactly what she wants!

I also really, really think that your dad should do one other special thing with you (you, without Sam or Dora) each summer and since you are outdoorsy, maybe it could be a weekend camping trip or an overnight rafting trip. Sam has so very much time with him and you deserve for him to devote a little bit of time to you, just you, without you having to step aside because Sam is there and demanding the attention on your dad and grandad. \n\nBest of luck, sweetheart.

He needs to hear it ALL.", "Her dad would probably insist Sam be included in that outing as well.", "OP has accepted what she means to her dad, she knows who he's choosing, that's why she wants her one special thing with her dad to remain that way, but just because her dad feels a certain way about the girl doesn't mean OP has to. And I'd say reddit is actually pretty  consistent that parents don't get to force relationships of any kind on their children.", "Absolutely fucking yes Op has every right to be resentful.  My dad has 4 kids, me and my three half siblings.  He still made a point to spend time with each of us individually even if it was just an hour a month.  My stepmom did the same.  Op gets no other time with just her and her dad than this.  Sam and Sam's mom absolutely suck because they don't want op to have any alone time with her dad and her dad sucks for prioritizing his stepdaughter over his bio daughter\n\nEdited for typos", "Op's not the one risking it, her dad is.  He's already made it clear to op that she is not his priority", "Step-sister gets all the time in the world one on one with OP's father. Why does OP not get any? Why does she have to be the one to sacrifice ALL of her time with her father in favor of someone else who lives with him every single day?", "He probably would...but the seed would be planted and he just might start paying attention to what he's been doing for so long.\n\nHe should be ashamed that she's here on reddit crying about the way her own father has pushed her aside and has been so blatant about his prioritizing Sam's feelings while *never* doing anything whatsoever to assure the OP of her place in his heart should be a wake-up call for him.", "That would be sad. If that were case, I  would stop visiting", "Or go off on her for \"airing family dirty laundry\" - even though this is all anonymous and we don't know who any of them are. \ud83d\ude44", "And?", "Op does have the right to be resentful - is it worth feeling that way for the rest of her life?", "So why do you think ops dad is not wanting to continue to exclude his other daughter?", "Great question!  Why do you think dad is wanting to include his other daughter?", "The fact that she feels that he wouldn't care if she stopped going, whether he would care or not is irrelevant, it's that he's let her get to the place where she isn't sure he would", "Given the fact that her dad is emotionally neglecting her needs in favor of his stepdaughter I wouldn't blame her if she did.  Her dad is the one ruining the relationship with op by putting his stepdaughter above op", "The stepdaughter gets OP's dad the majority of the time.  Him giving OP some time with just him and OP isn't \"excluding\" the stepdaughter, it's him giving both girls time alone with him.", "OF COURSE IT'S WORTH IT???? Who in their right mind would want to be with someone who treats you like the second choice, much less your own dad? Seriously dude, how can you write that and think whatever you are saying it's right? Ignore all of the other internet strangers in this post, a 15 YEAR OLD GIRL, who is hurting because her dad can't grow a fucking spine and is making her doubt he even loves her is READING YOU, you're asking for a child to just suck it up for the worth of a fucking tradition she's grasping with claws and fangs because it's the only time she can be alone with his spineless father. It's not about the outdoor activity, it's not about the traditions, it's not even about it being hold around Christmas, it's about her being ALONE with her father, she'd prolly love to count sand grains with him if it meant she doesn't have to share the MINIMAL attention he gives her.", ">Wondering if it\u2019s worth Op losing this tradition because they don\u2019t agree\n\nShe is losing it anyways. Because a big part of the tradition is that it is a day where she can be selfish and want some alone time with her dad. If you lose the part of the tradition you enjoy and it just turns into another humdrum activity is there a point in continuing it?", "We all know exactly why. He favors the shiny new daughter over the old tomboy one. To hell with what his first daughter wants, \"his little girl\" wants to horn in on everything he does, including one on one time with his first child, which she literally never gets otherwise now.", "You are saying he doesn\u2019t want to spend 1:1 time with Op? He is making that choice.", "Why are you so determined to try and find some reason to give the dad a pass for his shitty behavior?  Why bother even speculating why the dad is being an asshole?", "Because he sucks at being her dad. Just because OP is ''tomboy-ish'' as she says (I think this is only her way of saying she's better at being outdoor than her stepsister) doesn't mean she should be ignored. My nephew is good at playing outside, that doesn't mean that I, as an adult, will let a minor child do their own thing and letting him be expose to go coddle some other kid, that's just basic adult thinking. If Sam needs someone to check on her, then dad and grandad can take turns, doesn't mean both have to ignore OP because she doesn't need someone watching every step she takes.", "Yes that is exactly what I'm saying. Do you not understand that \"one on one time\" means only two people are involved, not anyone else???"]}
