She also lives primarily with my dad while I spend friday night to monday morning at his house and around 3-5 weeks during school break.\n\nNow my paternal family is really outdoorsie, we like to do a bunch of things around that Sam is included and we just ignore each other during them while enjoying our time with others, however, my dad, grandad, aunt and I have a special treasure hunt we do around Christmas that it's really special to me. It's like the only real time I have with my dad because, while Sam is not as bitchy as some I've read here, she really likes to demand both my grandad and dad's attention and since they consider me ''tomboy-ish'' they kinda ignore me to coddle her which sucks.\n\nMy dad asked me around my 10th  birthday if he could invite Sam and I said no. I've been saying no ever since and while he doesn't like it, he respects it, he does other stuff with her without me and I don't complain. This year, however, Sam is very adamant on going and I just don't want to, my dad is pressuring me to let her come as well as Dora,  while my aunt and grandma are insisting he just leaves this thing untouched between us but my dad doesn't want to hurt ''his little girl's feelings''. \n\nNGL, that stung o I said that if he really wants her there, then he doesn't have to pick me up for Christmas this year and to just leave me be. I called my mom to pick me up and my dad tried to console me and apologize because I was crying but I just asked him to leave me alone and got to the porch to wait. Sam and Dora insist that I'm and AH and I'm acting selfish but the way I see it it's not like that, this is the only real thing I have with my dad, I have to do everything else with him and Sam or else I get a nasty look.

You're not asking her to be excluded from everything. You just want this one special tradition to remain untouched.\n\nMaybe remind your dad that because they have him full time, and you only have him half the time, they already have moments with him dedicated just to them. Why don't you also deserve that level of focus from him?\n\nI hope you can find a compromise that leaves you feeling cared for.", "NTA.  Your father is TA.  His wife and her daughter are likewise TA.  As represented, this has been, for your entire life a you-dad thing.  Your father is willing to surrender this last activity to pacify his wife and the child he provides care to 24/7/365, while only taking care of you 2 days/week + summer.  Clearly you understandably feel pushed out as his only daughter in favor of someone he has not, apparently, adopted.  You understandably treasure what little father-daughter time you can get, but he wants to destroy that.  I\u2019m sorry your father seems to have put you in second place rather than at least equal to his wife\u2019s daughter.  He is a major AH.  I would not be surprised if, after reaching the age of maturity, you cut contact with him.  He will lose any remaining father/daughter traditions with you, in favor of his wife\u2019s daughter, like walking you down the aisle.  Fortunately, your mom is there.", "I hate that you have to teach your dad how to make you feel like a priority. In this instance because of the other multiple family members involved, it makes it harder for him to say no to them and yes to you because you are outnumbered, and because it is in the middle of a holiday gathering. If it were an activity that just you and Dad did, he wouldn't likely consider letting others be involved.  Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to understand how having one solo event a year is very important. I came from a huge family, and my parents also didn't make alone time a priority - unless it was their favorite. \n\nNTA, but I think that you need to talk to Dad this week without threatening to not see him and while trying to contain your frustration/anger. It is possible that he is not well schooled in parenting a teenaged daughter. And if he doesn't seem to get it, tell him an Internet Stranger is worried that you will have daddy issues later in life and end up only dating married men at least a decade older. A joke like that would have completely shocked my dad, and likely would yours too, but it would also give him something to consider.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. I think simply because not only did he refer to his stepdaughter as his \"little girl\" when she's NOT his biological daughter and you are.\n\n>since and while he doesn't like it, he respects it, he does other stuff with her without me and I don't complain. \n\nPlus it sounds like they do a lot of stuff together without you and you never complain, so I feel they don't have a right to pressure you to let them join when you've never pressured them to let you join their bonding time. \n\n>this is the only real thing I have with my dad,\n\nYou also said she LIVES with him, she's basically his kid. You only see him four times a week. She sees him every day, he should be trying to run away from her not pressure you to bring her. It's not your fault you have a dad and she doesn't. She sounds like a living centipede. And shame on your grandparents for not paying attention to you and coddling someone who refuses to join the activity", "NTA. Your father lives with Sam, she can have him any other day of the week.  Dora and Sam are both being greedy with your dad's attention. \n\nI would sit with him and explain to him exactly how you feel. If he can't respect that then you know exactly where he stands and it's up to you If you want to spend Christmas with him or not.", "NTA.  It is very clear that out of everything that this was the one special thing with your dad.  Your step mother should have been adult enough to not get involved and your dad should have respected you just wanting this one thing with him.  Your step sister should have been fully shut down on this instead of being an entitled pain.  Good parenting by your dad destroying his relationship with you.", "I find this so sad.  I'm sorry you are dealing with this.  NTA.  I'd let him know what you said here or even show him this because you articulated your feelings really well.  Sam is replacing you and this guy is your biological father who is supposed to love you and want to spend time with you one on one.  It also sounds like he's favoring her.  I'm absolutely not suggesting this, but I know my own personality and that would be more than enough for me just letting him go.  If my dad couldn't make me a priority, he's not worth it to me.  Again, I'm not suggesting that.  I just know how defeated this would make me feel.  Much love to you.", "NTA and I'm disappointed that your dad doesn't respect your feelings. It's great that he's close to Sam but you already have limited time with him. I think you have every right to expect him to keep one thing for just the 2 of you.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nMan, that is beyond rude.\n\nSo your his biological daughter, the youngest & yet he refers to her as his little girl??\n\nHave one last treasure hunt with him & slip in some passive aggressive notes into the clues.  End it with one that says you are done with your visits to him until he removes his head from somewhere & realises how much he is hurting his own daughter.", "\u201cDad, your little girl is right here, and your repeated asking is hurting MY feelings.\u201d\n\nUnless\u2026how uninvolved is Sam\u2019s dad? Have you ever met him? Has your mum? Is it possible that your dad and Dora\u2019s quick marriage was because he had something going on before either of you were born and your mum found out about it when you were three? Is it possible you really are hurting your dad\u2019s little girl\u2019s feelings and it was a Freudian slip?\n\nAnd\u2026it looks like my gummy just kicked in.\n\nAlso, NTA", "NTA. You should explain everything you\u2019ve said here to your father. Knowing how you feel to a deeper extent will help him understand why he needs to stick up for you in this case.", "I hope your dad comes to understand just how much he just messed everything up in his life. nTA and you deserve better", "NTA\n\nI won\u2019t expand. I\u2019m just really, really sorry OP.", "NTA. You're allowed to (and deserve to) have a special thing that's just between you and your dad. He probably doesn't realize how special this time really is to you. I would have a sit down with him (no stepmom or step sister around).", "NTA. Your dad has failed to make you a priority 99% of the time and now the last 1% he wants to take that from you too? He needs to know the risk of losing you, both visitation and contact. Have you talked to him before about feeling like you never spend one on one time just you & him, outside of this one activity? Sounds like grandma and your aunt know how it is.", "NTA - Even if she was your Bio sibling, you still should have one on one time with your parents.  My daughter does certain things with me and has dad daughter activities.", "NTA. You're being replaced. It stings but at least he has shown his true colors. WHen someone shows you how little you mean to them, believe them. \n\n I'd never spend another minute with him unless forced, and even then I wouldn't even look his way. If he wants his \"little girl\" so bad let him have her. You don't have to be some after thought while your dad plays stepdad with his fake daughter.", "Definitely NTA. I really hope your dad sees sense here. You really are not in TA for wanting to have this activity with your dad. Your dad has respected your decision for so long and it seems twisted he is now trying to force you to give up this alone time with him during this tradition. Stay strong!", "NTA.\n\nSam isn't your sister and you are allowed to have your own traditions with your dad.  She can make her own traditions with him.  They are being a bit lazy and entitled to think that they can and should hone in on your time with your father.\n\nYour dad is a pushover for not emphatically telling them no.  I'd pass on participating if the tradition changes without your consent.", "NTA", "You should get a trip with your dad.\n\nBut if he truly loves her as his own, he should take a trip with her w/o you.\n\nYou both can get time fairly", "NTA the little bit of time you get with your dad is precious to you. I can't imagine how much it must have hurt when he referred to Sam as his little girl and not wanting to hurt her. Obviously he is okay with hurting your feelings. Dad is the TA. Dora is the TA. Sam is the TA. \nIt strikes me that the Steps don't want you to have a close, unique, and special relationship with your dad.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry this happened. A good father knows that it is important to spend quality alone time with each child. There should be a special event/tradition with each child. The treasure hunt is your tradition with your dad, granddad, and aunt. If he wants that with his stepdaughter, then he needs to create a tradition for her. That is his failure. \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to hurt \u2018his little girl\u2019s feelings\u2019.\u201d My heart dropped when I read that. That is just blatant favoritism. I don\u2019t blame you for skipping Christmas with them. I don\u2019t know if it is possible for your dad to ever repair the damage. \n\nAlso, shame on both your dad and granddad for coddling her. That\u2019s how spoiled kids are created. And that is precisely what Sam is turning into. \n\nI agree with other posters that you share this post with your dad. I\u2019d also suggest you share it with your granddad too. I hope they are both hang their heads in shame.", "Nta this is the one thing you and your dad do together. It\u2019s time you talk to your mom. Let her know how your dad and his family treat you.BUT YOU ARENOT SELFISH FOR WANTING THIS TRADTION TO STAY BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU", "Nta. Please sit your dad down with this thread and make him read it.\n\nHe needs a clue-by-four wake up call.\n\nHe can keep this activity for you.", "Please show this post to your father. I think it will help him understand how much he is hurting you.", "She's trying to overstep you being his daughter it's a power-play to see if she can get what she wants. You have a right to want alone time with your father, and they need to respect that.", "NTA. Maybe show him this post with everyone calling him on his bs.\n\nIf you see this, OP's dad, you're failing your daughter.", "Your dad, stepmother, and Sam are the true AH.", "NTA. I hope you still go through with the tradition with your other relatives. Let your dad have a one on one with his step daughter", "NAH - Parents should 100% spend one on one time with each of their children. You are right for wanting time alone with your dad. That should be a regular ongoing thing not an annual event.\n\nFrom his perspective, he doesn't want to exclude his step-child from a family celebration at Christmas. It is good that he wants to be a decent step-parent, we have heard a lot of stories about bad ones on this sub-reddit.\n\nHow are you communicating your feelings to your dad? There is a difference between \"I don't want her there\"(which implies there is an issue with you and her) vs. \"I really want to spend some quality time with you, which we don't get to do often\".", "It\u2019s understandable that you want one on one time with your dad- and have had this with your tradition for 5 years on your terms. It sounds like your dad doesn\u2019t agree with you any longer. Are you willing to lose this tradition because the two of you disagree?", "YTA. I get that what you have with your father is special but Sam grew up without a father, remember? He loves her very much as well as you.
