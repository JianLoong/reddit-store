I have a fear of large bodies of water and spiders, so I don't go to the beach and I swiftly walk away from arachnids (occasionally while making high pitched noises), I DON'T tell people not to go in the ocean or own tarantulas because of my own issues with them. Like you said, the complex is pet-friendly, you pay to have him there, and frankly they're being ridiculous. If dogs (literally one of the most popular pets on the planet) are such a distressing issue for them they should have looked for a pet free place to live. That responsibility was on them, not you. Hopefully they'll learn to be comfortable around him in time, or at the very least stop acting like it's the end of the world every time you walk the sweet bean!", "I live in a country where poverty is rampant and lots of people do not consider dogs pets, so I can maybe shine some light on why some people have this fear of dogs.\n\nWith poverty causing even basic human needs to be neglected. Dogs often become wild and hunt for food from humans and have no problem fighting for it. In some cases they have even hunted babies and kids. Lots of people also use bigger dogs, intentionally making them aggressive to protect their property. These often escape or turn on their owners. Reading about kids and adults being mauled by dogs is very common. So although this is not your pups behavior, their experiences immediately brings an irrational fear when they see your pup. \n\nIt's not your fault in any way. You handled it great. They really should not be living in a pet friendly place if this is the case. Just wanted to give some insight to why you might have gotten that reaction. You're definitely NTA for standing up for your pup.", "NTA. Entitled people suck.", "NTA.

There are apartments that are pet friendly while some aren't. We all have something that we don't like seeing/hearing, if every person file a complain then we probably all need to live on our single home sized island and away from each other.", "NTA. Sounds like Tommy is leashed and well-behaved. You went above and beyond by offering to plan so you wouldn\u2019t be in the courtyard at the same time as the kid. If they want a dog-free home environment, they can move.

Your neighbors are unhinged. Buy a go-pro. Record all of your walks as these people have already demonstrated their willingness to lie about your dog and its behavior. They will likely escalate their complaints to animal control. You want to have evidence that they're lying. If they lie further to building security or a 3rd party, file harassment complaints with your LL and look into criminal harassment statutes in your area. \n\nGet security cams for your apartment because people like this may try to poison or harm your dog. If you can install a ring or other equivalent device, do so. Be extra attentive with where you walk him and what he gets into. I would not put it past these people to leave a poisoned meatball in the courtyard or deliberately use dangerous to pet cleaning products in the hallway. Irrational people are dangerous.", "NTA. Keep in front of the leasing office so that doesn't become an issue, but otherwise sounds very much like a not-your-problem.", "Same, I have met several people who are terrified of dogs due to their culture or whose religious beliefs prevent them from interacting with dogs.", "Some foreigners are just stupid.", "Our complex doesn't allow pets and, guess what? We have multiple dogs here. People claim they are not pets but ESAs. They get to live here AND don't have to pay pet fees so more people are getting false paperwork for ESAs and moving in. \n\nIt's such a scam.", "Or they're from a country where rabies is prevalent and rabies vaccines aren't."]}
