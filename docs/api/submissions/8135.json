Like you said, the complex is pet-friendly, you pay to have him there, and frankly they're being ridiculous. If dogs (literally one of the most popular pets on the planet) are such a distressing issue for them they should have looked for a pet free place to live. That responsibility was on them, not you.

Dogs often become wild and hunt for food from humans and have no problem fighting for it. In some cases they have even hunted babies and kids. Lots of people also use bigger dogs, intentionally making them aggressive to protect their property. These often escape or turn on their owners. Reading about kids and adults being mauled by dogs is very common. So although this is not your pups behavior, their experiences immediately brings an irrational fear when they see your pup. \n\nIt's not your fault in any way. You handled it great.

I have a huge problem with bad coping mechanisms, and replacing those with animal care (feeding, treats, playing, etc) is a huge help. I also struggle with routines, both creating, maintaining, *and* getting rid of, and building a routine of pet care helps a lot. I struggle with eating, as I lack motivation to get up and will commonly forget to eat. But my ESA demanding food gets me out of bed. I keep her food near mine, so it reminds me to eat.\n\nThose are just a few things. She does a lot more, including upping my happiness as a whole. Just because you dont have all the information, does not mean that ESAs are a 'scam' or fake. Mental illnesses are becoming more talked about. People are becoming more willing to accept the reality that mental illnesses exist, which means more resources of varying levels to aide people with them.\n\nI will admit, that some people do use ESA to get out of paying pet rent/ to allow having a pet in a no pets apartment.
