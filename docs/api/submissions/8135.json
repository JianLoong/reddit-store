Lots of people also use bigger dogs, intentionally making them aggressive to protect their property. These often escape or turn on their owners.

If they are truly terrified, it\u2019s something worth working on to live peacefully for both parties.  I have a 100 pound lab mix.  He is well trained and incredibly nice but his size alone can be hard for those afraid of dogs.  I do my best to also respect those that find him intimidating.   Just because I love dogs doesn\u2019t mean everyone does. Have to compromise when living in tight areas.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t make any concessions. They are being ridiculous", "'It's unfortunate that an old woman has got this far in life with such little understanding.' NTA. Do you have any Tommy pics to share?", "NTA - I hate dogs. Seriously and most dog owners, and most pet owners, and lots of people. But the dog is leash trained and you have tight control over it. You are also already paying extra money. You didn't get on a tiny elevator with obviously afraid people, you were in a public space you pay more for. \n\nMy next door neighbor has a pitbull. She barks at everything and tries to jump attack everyone but he always has a tight handle on the leash and he is kind enough if we leave at the same time to wait until I get in my car. \n\nThe reverse is I wait until he is on the sidewalk before exiting so she doesn't get riled up and they can have a nice walk.", "I live in the suburbs and walk my dog on the sidewalks. She's a large, Wolfy looking husky, so I understand if people are leery of her, even though she's a husky and loves everyone. One day I was walking through a nearby neighborhood, and a woman was walking on the other side of the street with a toddler in a stroller and like a kindergartner walking alongside. The woman literally screamed when she saw us. The kids, who'd both been looking with curiosity to that point, started crying. She literally ran away with the stroller and grabbed the little girl. How sad to be so afraid, and then to pass that fear on to your kids.", "File a complaint with the leasing office. Dogs are allowed under the terms of your lease. Your neighbors should not be allowed to harass you about it. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  OP doesn't say what the leasing office had to say with regard to all of this or if they suggested to the complainers that this complex allows pets.  As others have stated, if they don't like dogs . . . move.  I sure as hell wouldn't go out of my way to redirect my entry and exit or alter my walks with my dog bc they had issues.  You are following the rules.  Get a  \"gopro\" and record everything.  Don't trust these people at.all.", "NTA. They are being completely unreasonable. Keep an eye on Tommy in case they try something evil, and if you hear another word from them, report them to the leasing office for harassment.", "NTA.  I love the body cam idea.  But also, if you give in now, it won't stop.  Just one nitpick:\n\n>I helped them understand that Tommy has literally never hurt a fly\n\nThis is the dumbest thing dog owners say all the time.  **Every** dog that has ever hurt a human or another dog had a first time.  The fact that Tommy never did such a thing is irrelevant.", "NTA - BUT as someone with a fear of dogs, especially unknown ones, I would have been glued to the wall as well. I have had plenty of dog owners tell me their dogs are \"friendly\" and \"wouldn't hurt a fly\" and then bite me. I literally CAN'T relax and dogs sense that. \n\nI agree that it is not fair that you not be allowed to use the courtyard, but would it be that big of an inconvenience to use the other elevator?  I am not saying that you HAVE to, but it is a sign of goodwill. Normally I would say that they should have to take on the inconvenience, but  it sounds like their door is between your door and the elevator. Also, it sounds like you already do, but make sure to ALWAYS keep a tight hold on him whenever they are around. Not for them, but for your dog.  Dogs and people with canine phobia's are one bad day away from a bite and the dog always loses in those situations.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's unfortunate they're being unreasonable and hysterical.", "Great suggestion. I will get a go pro for sure. The common areas all already have cameras but then not sure how well they function or are maintained.", "Yes, NTA, but I fear that they will go after your dog through the legal system.", "Agreed literally had a woman kick my 9 week old puppy for this reason. Her fiance (canadian) had asked to pet her so I took her over (not knowing she was terrified of dogs) and my pup jumped up on him to give kisses and she kicked her. Left the two of them arguing. We moved a few weeks later so never knew how that worked out.", "I did not know that posts allowed pictures. I will try adding one now", "Soon :) Another golden it will be, although gf wants a GSD", "Yes, a Go pro camera on your head or chest and one on the dog. Protect yourself. Careful with any \u201cfood scraps\u201d on the grass. They might try to poison him.", "I had a golden retriever for almost 16 years, Harvey. He died in 2015. My dad died in 2016 and my mum in 2022. I loved them all but it\u2019s Harvey I miss the most. Wonderful dogs.", "I mean, almost any pet is beneficial and brings happiness for its owner. The question is, at what level do we decide that a person's need for the animal outweighs everyone else's right to be free from animals in animal-free areas, and what requirements do we put on the animal? We'd both like to bring our dogs everywhere, but you have a legit need for it and I don't. How do we make sure you're allowed to, and I'm not?\n\nThe answer, at least where I live, is that we don't. There are few laws or regulations guiding it, any therapist who thinks it might help can make up their own document allowing it, or you can make it up yourself on your computer, and most establishments will allow it rather than risk a lawsuit. You do not have to give your animal any special training, and no one checks to make sure it isn't dangerous.\n\nWe're in a situation where there are tons of people *without* a serious need abusing the system to bring pets places where they otherwise would not be allowed. People see that, and they call it a scam. \n\nIt's a shame, the whole ESA space needs to be much, much more tightly regulated, because they are a good solution to certain issues. We can't be going on the honor system though.", "Yup.  \nGrew up over that way.  \nDogs weren\u2019t kept as pets normally\u2026 and strays are feral. Rabbies is also pretty rampant amongst the strays \u2026 and rabbies vaccines aren\u2019t always available.  \n\nDogs were \u201charam\u201d. So it\u2019s definitely cultural.", "You know that an ESA is different from a service animal, right? An ESA is only allowed in an apartment complex, not anywhere else. An ESA is quite literally, \"This person struggles pretty moderately, and having this around would really benefit them in regulation and moderation.\"", "I encountered someone TODAY arguing with the manager about bringing their ESA into a restaurant, and threatening a lawsuit. I've been stuck on flights with them, the airlines only recently stopped putting up with it. \n\nIf folks with ESAs didn't try to bring them anywhere else, people would be much less hostile to the idea.", "Also, you cant just make up your own letter. Landlords are allowed to require that your ESA letter comes from a therapist licensed *in your state*, the ESA letter has to have your therapists:\n\n1. License number\n\n2. Date they got their license\n\n3. Their contact information\n\n4. An ability for the landlord to reach your therapist to ask questions  - which they are allowed to do. They cannot ask *what* the disorder is, but they are allowed to ask *why* the ESA is necessary, what symptoms the ESA is aiding with, documentation that ESAs are actually beneficial, and a few other things.\n\nIts not *just* an honor system. Theres a whole thing that goes into owning one, and a landlord accepting one. \n\nAnd while ESAs are protected, they also dont have rights. They are not allowed in public areas that are not animal friendly, as they are not trained, licensed service animals. And your landlord can request you remove them, and sue you, if your ESA disturbs other residents, causes damages, etc.\n\nThe lady that was arguing about bringing her ESA into a restaurant is in the wrong. As far as the airline, thats actually up to the airline. With proper proof, a lot of airlines *choose* to allow ESAs. Plenty even allow just regular pets below a certain size. People can have severe anxiety to the point of breakdowns/blackouts from planes,  and imo i dont think it hurts you to be a little compassionate and understanding of other peoples genuine issues and disabilities, rather than trying to shame them and make it out as if everyone with an ESA abuses the system.\n\nHeres the thing: more people have ESAs than you realize. The *only* reason you think\n\n>If folks with ESAs didn't try to bring them anywhere else, people would be much less hostile to the idea.\n\nThis, is because *those in the wrong are the loudest*. 'The shallow creek babbles the loudest'. You only see those who abuse the system because theyre loud about it. People who dont, you arent seeing. Youre lumping everyone together based on those who are doing wrong bc you can see them more often due to *their* actions.", "All I can tell you is that that is absolutely not how it has worked in my experience, as someone who rented for most of my life, as a person who likes to travel and do stuff, and as a family member of a person who brings their untrained, aggressive, emotional support dog everywhere and nearly always gets away with it.\n\nPerhaps what is needed is an informational campaign, so that landlords and business owners are more aware of their rights in regards to ESAs. A lot of people seem to think they have the same rights as service dogs because a lot of owners of ESA very strongly assert that they DO have those rights, and people don't want an ADA lawsuit on their hands. \n\nI want to be clear that I am NOT lumping everyone together, and frankly I think it's dishonest that you're accusing me of saying everyone with an ESA abuses the system. I never said anything close to that. Pointing out what I think is a problem is not the same as pointing a finger at everyone.", ">All I can tell you is that that is absolutely not how it has worked in my experience, as someone who rented for most of my life, as a person who likes to travel and do stuff, and as a family member of a person who brings their untrained, aggressive, emotional support dog everywhere and nearly always gets away with it.\n\nAnd I'm telling *you* that that is absolutely *not* how it works, legally and otherwise. People *do* abuse the system, I made that clear in my very first comment, but that does not mean everyone does, that does not mean the *system* is, and that does not mean that anything needs to change about it. I already listed for you everything that is available for landlords to do surrounding ESAs. If they choose to not do that, then it sounds like its on *them*, and those are who you should be mad at. Not people with disabilities. \n\n>Perhaps what is needed is an informational campaign, so that landlords and business owners are more aware of their rights in regards to ESAs.\n\nOr, perhaps, what is needed is for people to research every area of their jobs. If people abusing the ESA system is such a prevailing problem, as you say it is, wouldn't that be one of the first things someone looking into becoming a landlord should research? Or business owners? There doesn't need to be an informational campaign, all of this information is easily and readily accessible with quite literally .5 seconds of research. It is not on others to do your research for you especially not when it's already so easy to find. If you don't look into it, then that's on you, not the person with the ESA or the people trying to get one. It's not on therapists, or anyone else. Laws are accessible for everyone to read. Read them, or you have no one to blame but yourself if you don't know."]}
