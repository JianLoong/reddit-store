So your wife was at fault and for some reason you aren't holding her accountable for her actions and instead say your mom is overreacting. I for one wouldn't invite someone who was gossiping about me to my wedding. So I can't see how she is in the wrong for that.

So I can't fault you for doing the same.  She'd have to do/say something that put divorce on the table for me to publicly take someone else's side. I walked out of my mom's house because while we were all making centerpieces for the reception together and I was having issues tying bows she said \"He'll be better at it next time.\"  Just so you know where I'm coming from. And my mom is not a JNMOM, she and my wife have a good relationship now, but between the fact that my mom is on her second marriage and that I am 14 years younger than my wife, some subconscious thing she was thinking slipped out even though she didn't mean it as a hurtful thing.  And I knew that the moment it came out of her lips, and also knew that she thought the best thing to ever happen to me was my wife for so many other reasons, but in the moment instead of trying to defend her to my wife, I supported my wife and walked out of the house.\n\nOn the other hand, you are destroying your relationship with your mom even though she's right, even though you know she's right.

She gossiped about your mom, exposed a relationship before she was ready, and then screamed at her for having sex? I mean did she think your mom was being loud on purpose or did she really scream at adult guests just for doing what a pair of romantically involved adults tend to do in private?

They should have it spelled out clearly and succinctly that she was shrieking so loud that there was nowhere in the house that you could get away from that volume level and it was extremely disrespectful that she would choose to do this under somebody else's roof when EVERYONE was at home. If, for whatever insane reason, they don't care about this and still want to insist that your wife is a bad host for not wanting to listen to her MIL shrieking while screwing then you can go ahead and tell them to host her next time and to enjoy the show since they seem to think family should be that close. \n\nI'm not sure how you've chosen to interpret this situation, but there is literally no way that your mom was being that loud unintentionally. Or that she was being that loud and genuinely expected that nobody else could hear her. \n\nFor some sick, twisted reason she thought this was an appropriate power play during a time you were putting genuine effort into trying to get two important people in your life to - at the very least - co-exist.

You have worked so hard here at making things just borderline okay and these two people who never had a real reason to harbor such animosity towards each other just insist on digging their heels in further each time! \n\nYour mother is a bad mother and if your wife wants to do better by you then she needs to be a much bigger and better person in the wake of your mom's shit-flinging.

So I don't even know what to suggest in addressing this with them.\n\nI mean at that point I'd just ask them lots of questions about where their really strange boundaries really are with this? Would they themselves do this if they went to stay at somebody else's house for ONE night? Would they themselves do this if they went to stay at the home of somebody they were already on not good terms with? Would they be that loud and see absolutely no issue with that? If they themselves wouldn't ever feel so inclined to behave that way under somebody else's roof, then why in the actual hell would they think that other people and relatives should be 100% comfortable with it when your mother does it? I'd be asking them why they want a son to listen to his mother having sex and find that enjoyable and funny?\n\nIt's just ... messed up? I don't know, but their perspective of consent when it comes to sexual activity is way off. Generally speaking, anybody who is able to witness your sexual activity IS a part of that sexual activity. They are a party to the sex that is happening even if they're not directly a part of it themselves, and the consent of these parties does matter. If you don't have the consent of a third person for them to witness you and a partner doing the do, that does actually constitute as a type of sexual assault because you didn't get their consent. The law, speaking just from American perspective, does also uphold this in the sense that things like flashing, overtly sexual displays in public spaces, and being recorded without your knowledge during sex are criminal offenses. I mean, your mom entered your home knowing that you were having her over in an attempt to improve the relationship dynamic and her decision was to have shrieking loud sex for her SON and his WIFE to listen to while they were at home under their own roof. That's vile and your family thinking that that shouldn't cause even an inch of discomfort is mind-boggling fucked up.\n\nIn your shoes I guess I'd just outright and directly ask my mom: *\"Why did you, in the one night you were staying at my home, have such loud sex while you knew that your child and his wife were at home that we could hear it throughout the house? Why did you want that? Why did you want me to hear you having sex? Because at the volume you were at, there's no way you believed that nobody could hear you or that the walls were keeping the noise in, so don't lie to me and tell me why you wanted me to hear you having sex? You could've had quieter sex or you could've simply not had sex for one night while you were staying with us, but instead you chose to do this and I want to know why.\"* \n\nI'd be asking the relatives if they'd find it funny and enjoyable if you were moaning and shrieking with your wife if y'all were ever to have them over or vice versa? Because in their logic, if your wife is a bad host for being uncomfortable with shrieking loud sex under her roof, then they would be bad guests for being uncomfortable with the hosts doing the exact same if they were ever to stay over. And they would also be hypocrites if they felt any level of discomfort should you or anybody else do the exact same under their roof.

So, while out in a public restaurant, your mom kisses her supposed archenemy and is spotted by a friend of your wife, and, like is natural, says something to your wife. Your wife then says something to the family, probably out of surprise and confusion (as well as probably a little bit of amusement) because everyone thought she hated this man. I guess that *technically*, is gossip BY DEFINITION, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was meant to be either gossip OR malicious. I mean, I probably couldn\u2019t help saying something either, because I would be wondering what big thing I was somehow oblivious to.

Your mom is a huge hypocrite and you are NTA for not going to the wedding but you are a bit TA for defending her\u2026", "Yeah I have to say there is a LOT to unpack in Mum\u2019s behaviour. And I\u2019m baffled at how the rest of the family is siding with her, or why OP is defending her, unless there is a whole lot of missing reasons. Did Mum just make life so hard on the rest of the family that they chose her over OP\u2019s wife? I don\u2019t get it. \nAnd definitely if someone told me a family member had been seen out with a new date I\u2019d probably ask if anyone knew about the new beau. Doubly so if it was a situation like this, where I\u2019d be like \u201cI should she hated X, but they were kissing in a restaurant? Anyone know what the deal is?\u201d I don\u2019t actually think asking about something that\u2019s seen in public makes her bad. This whole scenario feels so surreal.", "\"Shreiking.\" The OP said it was shrieking.", "I mean he did that well enough on his own but yeah never said my mom was a great person", "Honestly, I can\u2019t even blame the wife for finding it funny. MIL launches a public smear campaign against the married man she\u2019s secretly fucking? That\u2019s gold.", "How would your wife feel, if your mum did everything your wife did.\n\nYour wife would expect an apology not other way round.\n\nYour mum is right and you have proven that no matter what your wife did or does she right.\n\nFuck etiquette your wife needs to apologize for been a gossip.\n\nYTA for not stopping your wife.", "NTA I'd be talking shit like OP's wife if someone I knew hated a person enough to go on a smear campaign against them but then started dating them. That's fucking weird. I'd have to do a constant \"sanity check\" with people. I would keep asking \"Is it me or is my MIL crazy because now she's doing xyz with so in so, but two years ago she she was spreading rumors about him\".", "Yeah. YTA. Your wife should not meddle into other\u2019s people business. She gossiped and made this an issue and you want your mom to just drop it? You guys didn\u2019t even apologize.\n\nYour wife is the type of person no one wants to hang out with. Except you obviously.", "the AH person in this is your wife. Honestly, wtf is wrong with your wife?", "You are not the asshole bet your mom be talking bad about ur wife too", "NTA for this, but probably the asshole for other reasons.", "Yeah, I'm confused by all the negative comments about this. NTA", "You shouldn\u2019t support anyone in your life who\u2019s acting like trash. That is the baseline lol. You dont need to defend your wife if she\u2019s treating your family like trash. Had to write that out for you cuz you seem super confused on that.", "Talking to family about how MiL was kissing someone MiL was running a *public smear campaign* against is \"getting into her MiL's business\"? Sounds like she was looking for more info about MiL's guano behaviour.", "How exactly is this a verdict on OP? His mom is a fucking nightmare. His wife clearly has issues of her own, but it's a full blown estrangement between the two, and if OP is going to choose to remain married to this woman, then of-fucking-course he's going to have to miss the wedding that his wife is spitefully being excluded from. There's not even really a dillema here, just a shitty reality.", "You shouldn't validate people's crazy overreactions either.\n\nOP's wife's sin was gossiping about mom's relationship. Not great, but not some relationship-ending affront. It's not even clear that his wife was responsible for everyone knowing since I doubt she announced it to his entire family in a big group. Who else gossiped about it and are they cut off as well?\n\nHis mom sounds like she has a history of drama given she went on a \"public smear campaign\" of her now-fiance. Who goes on a public smear campaign of *anyone* unless they're running against them for office? And apparently the reason she thinks his wife is a bad host is because she was having loud, shrieking sex in their home and his wife asked them to be quiet? OP says his mom isn't \"that\" MIL but I'm not convinced.", "There's absolutely nothing to indicate that OP is blindly supporting his wife. Quite the opposite actually, as supporting his wife has come at one hell of a personal cost.", "It's not really \"blindly supporting\" someone if your relationship with them is that you swore an oath to support one another for the rest of your lives.", "So you want to judge the DIL for talking about a woman who on social media berated/insulted a man for who knows what and then turns around and dates him and then is getting married to him. Yeah, that makes all the sense in the world. NOT. \n\nNeither one of these women are in the right and neither should expect an apology and son has no reason to go to the wedding if he doesn't want to. NTA", "Gossiping isn't rude, it's a social tool. Information spreads through gossip. It can be hurtful, but it can be very helpful too. Wouldn't you want to know about that one dangerous person in your friend group?\n\nI do agree that OP's wife was in the wrong, but gossiping isn't inherently bad or rude. It's just a tool, in the end", "There's various forms of support. Stopping your spouse from doing something stupid and helping them see the errors of their ways is a form of support, it's better than blindly enabling them so that they can keep doing it in future.\n\nAlso rest of your lives? That went out the window the moment divorce became a thing.", "Ur gonna take the gossipers word for it? I imagine OPs wife had her ears pressed to the walls so she could talk more shit about her MIL. OPs wife has 0 respect for his mom and he demonstrates it easily by explaining all her bullying and victim flipping tendencies.", "THIS! \nNTA - don\u2019t waste anymore time on this.  Block the nasty comments and enjoy your life.", "According to the husband, The wife called the moms parents just being petty. No good reason for doing it other than to start shit.", "Are you sure your mom isn't \"that\" MIL? Normal moms generally don't have *shrieking* sex as a guest in their child's home, especially when they are trying to repair their relationship. Your mom sounds weird, immature, and dramatic. What was this \"public smear campaign\" of the man she's now marrying? Was it anything like her campaign against your wife?", "The stereotypical MIL can\u2019t let go of her son. My mom never wanted a child so yeah pretty sure it isn\u2019t a typical mil thing but genuine hurt from the gossip.\n\nNo the smear campaigns weren\u2019t at all the same. She had sex in our house one time (not even sure it was intentional, I just don\u2019t get how her having sex with some guy is revenge) and doesn\u2019t seem to think about us beyond that. To be honest my wife probably isn\u2019t worth a real smear campaign in her eyes", "No but it's better than starting more gossip at his !ums wedding.", "Wait, she never wanted you and doesn't care if you're at her wedding but can't let go of you? I'm not sure I understand what you mean.\n\nYour mom sounds like a nasty person, if I'm honest. Even if your wife was in the wrong in this instance, overall it sounds to me like you're both better off without your mother in your lives.", "Discretion is the better part of valor, I agree, wise words", "Just let it go, your family is straight-up nutso and you're not coming across much better.", "The mom goes on a public smear campaign then is seen kissing him in public and now we\u2019re worried about her privacy? Please. Lol.", "Based on OPs comments, the mom has royally messed up OP's head. She sounds manipulative tbh. Even if she doesn't realize it, she's made you feel like you owe her something because she tried to love you. Whether she felt pressured by others to have a kid or not. She chose to have you and should have loved you more. Therefore, I have serious misgivings about the mom in this whole thing.\n\nSo NTA. Your mom sounds like she has the messed up history not the wife. Even if your wife did gossip, that is a small thing.... not disinvite worthy. Also, your wife may not have understood how big a deal telling others was. Your mom sounds a bit narcissistic tbh. Good luck.", "Your wife is TA for gossiping about your mom's personal love life. We don't have enough info to know if your wife was, in fact, a bad host. Either way, your mom has a right to exclude your gossiping wife from her day.  However, she cannot expect you to come without your wife. I think you're right for sticking by your wife even though she may be to blame. You picked her, so you should stand by her and not disrespect her by going alone.", "ESH. I didn't see you say that your wife has apologized to your mother for gossiping, outing a relationship your mother wanted to keep private, and generally being uncool. How can you expect an apology, when your mother was the wronged party? That said, you don't have to go if you don't want to. But are you really going to throw away a relationship with your mother over petty nonsense like this? You can't un-miss a wedding.", "It boggles my mind that people don't see this woman as the AH she is. Plus she's gossiping about DIL's \"bad hosting\" and her son not going to the wedding to family members so they can bully him into coming!", "Because the wife\u2019s words made her look like a hypocrite more than marrying the guy does?"]}
