She has also heard in the past of all of the times I've gotten drunk and have been an asshole to my sister when not in the right frame of mind, but my sister and I are past that. As for how she found that out, I have no idea.

If she does, it will show everyone what a toxic person she is.", "NTA,\n\nGo to the wedding. Mother in law has literally no say in who goes. The bride and groom do. If MIL is able to get groom to cancel, like she says, you helped your sister dodge a bullet from marrying someone without a backbone. She\u2019s causing issues for no reason. Don\u2019t let it get to you, you have your sisters support, being there for her on her special day is more important", "NTA. MIL is an untrustworthy helicopter parent. Does her son know just how vile she is in the way she\u2019s speaking to you? He and the bride need to be made aware of her threats\u2014she is a much greater threat to their wedding day than you are and needs to be dealt with appropriately.", "NTA\n\nTake snapshots of the conversation and send them to the bride and groom. This woman sounds fucking insane", "NTA. First, congratulations on your sobriety! Second, you are not responsible for anybody else's actions. I'm sure you learned this while getting sober. Just like no one was responsible for your addiction but you, that woman is the only one responsible for her own behavior. Stay strong!", "NTA - she is using you as the latest manipulation tool\n\nThe bride and groom want you to attend.\n\nHis mother is toxic and he is aware.  He's the one that warned you that his mother was going to send alcohol to your house the night before the wedding.\n\nWhen you push back, she threatens to wear white to the wedding - bizarre threat.\n\nShe's trying to break up her son's relationship.  She's attacking you as this hurts your sister and could possibly causer her, via MIL's eyes, to pause or break up the wedding.  \n\nSince this hasn't worked, she then threatens to wear white which you have no control of.  She's a point blank lunatic regardless if you go or not.\n\nMy point is that she wants to break up the couple.  \n\nI can see why you are flustered and confused in your thinking.  This woman is in your space behaving unhinged.  \n\nIf, they ban the fianc\u00e9's mother, it will be because of her actions.\n\nI also would take your sister aside and ask if they, as a couple, have thought of uninviting the mother in law and hiring security.\n\nYou've already confronted her and she has upped the crazy.\n\nIn writing, text, tell her to stop the harassment.  Put her on notice if that she is discovered on your property it will be deemed trespassing.\n\nAfter drawing the metaphorical line in the sand, block her on your phone and all social media.  Learn about grey-rocking which is basically refusing to enter the drama arena.\n\nIf you can afford it, start placing cameras.\n\nFinally, this is your sister's wedding.  Her and your FBIL's vision for the monumental day is for you to be there.  They are the only people's opinion that matters.  If you don't go due to her harassment, you wound them both.   It won't be keeping the peace but creating an emotional wound to the couple.\n\nDon't engage or negotiate with emotional terrorists.\n\nCongrats on your recovery journey.", "NTA. The mother of the groom seems to be the only problem there.\nI had addicts and recovering addicts at my wedding and they were not the problem. And I was not worried about them and was right not to be.\n\nThis is total BS as nothing has happened and there is no reason to believe anything would happen. This is conflict over nothing, and there is no need to go there and make this uncomfortable for everyone. Make a deal with her, she will have every right to be upset if you do something wrong and then she can give you hell.

You can't ask them or tell them to do anything - it's their wedding - but if they are aware of everything she's stirring up, I would be surprised if they are complacent about it.  If she wears white, it's no reflection on YOU...  it's intentionally meant to fuck up their wedding.   For you.... have fun being a great MOH and lay low.
