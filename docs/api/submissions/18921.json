You should respect his wishes on the matter. I don't think you would be the A H if, when you're speaking with them, you let them know that you both are overwhelmed.

That said, I suggest you just hire help - that way, no one's feelings get hurt. \n\nYour husband can talk to his parents when he's in a better state of mind.

I know this is in the context of patently, but it ultimately seems like a communication/family culture issue more than anything else.\n\nMy husbands family is also not super direct and their communication style seems similar to how you describe your husbands family. My MIL went away and wanted to ask if my FIL could come to my house for dinner after dropping her at the airport, and it was 5 minutes until I understood what she was asking me. A few days later a similar thing happened with my FIL until he finally said \"I am actually asking if you could make the birthday cake\". \n\nOn the other hand, I have asked for things directly (can I take these lemons home?/can you help us move house this day?/can you drop that thing off tomorrow?) To varying degrees of success. Now I just ask my husband if I can ask something directly or if there is a better way, since I just don't know their communication and family culture intuitively.  For example, some things are better coming from him because their son and some things are better coming from me because of how they perceive gender roles. \n\nSo I think if you ask your husband whether you can ask directly first, you're NTA. That goes for anything, not just parenting stuff. \n\nP.s. I don't think you are entitled asking your family for help with your kids. That seems like a very normal thing to ask for help with.

It will not go down well coming from you, and I call BS on them moving 90 minutes away to \"help\". If they had moved 5 minutes down the road, of course. 90 minutes, nonsense. Maybe your husband knows it and is processing the fact his parents don't care. It's a hard one to swallow.\n\nYou have two separate problems. Tackle one at the time. What I would do is ask a good friend or hire a babysitter and get some much needed respite. Or a cleaner. Or both, just for a month or two. Money might be tight but your mental health is more important than savings right now for a few weeks. \n\nTHEN when you're in a better place mentally and more rested, invite the in laws over and casually say \"Don't worry, we're not asking you to be free babysitters, we've hired/asked someone to help us with that already as we understand that's not something you want to do\". They can't really argue that fact, and if they don't take that hint you can put this to bed. \n\nYour husband (and yourself to a degree) are mourning for the idea of involved grandparents and some practical help (that they created when they said they wanted to move closer).

If all goes well, they will soon realise how important those hours of help means, and start offering more.\n\nThis sounds like your husband doesn't want to ask, because he doesn't want to come across as demanding. And his parents dont want to \"invite themselves\" for fear of intruding. \n\nMaybe they are even waiting for an invitation? \"Can you come this Saturday at 2?\" is perhaps what they need to hear? \n\nI know my inlaws were like this, very careful not to make me feel intruded upon.

I accept that your husband's way of wording it does not explain that you need help.

You\u2019re in-laws are not actually obligated to help you with the kids. You could sit down and have a frank discussion, say that you\u2019re both struggling and if they\u2019re willing to help out for a little while - with a *fixed* time frame - then it would be appreciated.

Quite apart from them not being obligated, they\u2019ve clearly had the opportunity to become more involved and have chosen not to, chances are they will choose not to again. Reacting aggressively or negatively will simply reinforce this already distant behaviour\n\n3) your husband needs to be in agreement before you go ahead with it. They\u2019re *his* parents. His relationship with them is more complex and nuanced than yours. You\u2019ve already said he\u2019s upset about them not being more involved of their own choice. Read between the lines: it\u2019s not just about not wanting to beg them into seeing your kid, he\u2019s saying he shouldn\u2019t have to beg them to have an on-going relationship with *him*.

Or not even asking - \"we're really struggling at the moment with x y z\" may be enough. If he's just doing chill social invites and not sharing the struggles it's possible they just don't want to bother you, or find the commute a little much for a short social visit but would find it reasonable to help their son, daughter in law and grandkids. \n\n\nGood luck!", "Asking for help when you clearly need it for your mental health should be normal.

The worst time was having the oldest in kindergarten and the youngest home. However, daycares exist. We did drop in twice a week, until 3, then they went 5 days because socializing with other kids\u2014who they aren\u2019t allowed to tackle, punch, etc\u2014is *good* for them.
