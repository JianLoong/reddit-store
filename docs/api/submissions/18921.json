Naturally, this is a difficult and challenging season of our life. Any parent would understand that we are surviving, not necessarily thriving. \n\nMy in laws sold their home 3.5 hours away and purchased a home 1.5 hours away under the veil of being closer to us to be more actively involved grandparents to our 2 children. Since they have moved, we do not see them any more than we did when they lived 3.5 hours away. This breaks my husbands heart. (Added: They decided to move on their own accord, and told us for MONTHS it was because they wanted to be closer to us, which was wonderful to hear and we were excited for them to be closer for things like \u2018grandparents reading day\u2019 at daycare or for being there Christmas Day with our kids)\n\nI encourage him to ask them directly to come visit, to come over XYX days we are free, and encourage him to setup a plan with them so they know we are wanting some help. \n\nTwo under two has certainly been taxing, and especially the last few weeks (toddler tantrums \ud83d\ude43). I have asked my husband to be more direct and tell his parents we need some help and a break. He instead takes the passive approach of saying \u2018if you\u2019re free and wanna come visit we\u2019d love to see you!\u2019 Instead of a direct \u2018WE NEED HELP, can you come over?\u2019 \n\nThe In Laws have not taken him up on his offers  to come visit. My husband is of the opinion that \u2018if they wanted to come see their grandkids, they would\u2019 so he will not beg or nag\u2026 which I don\u2019t disagree with. However, we are all at the end of our ropes and some extra hands to help with the baby and entertain the toddler would be really wonderful. \n\nWIBTA if I spoke to my in laws directly about us wanting their help more? \n\n\u2014\u2014\nAdditional context: we have both had several mental breakdowns in the last few weeks from over stress, frustration, and exhaustion. My family lives 1500 miles away. We could hire a sitter, or a doula. But this is enmeshed with my husbands desire for his parents to be more actively involved in our kids lives.\n\nEdited to add: we are certainly not hoping for someone else to raise our kids. We are also not asking them to come over and babysit. We are asking them to come spend time and maybe feed the baby for us while we tackle some chores or play cars with the toddler so he gets some more 1:1 attention. \n\nEdited: we are not looking for a baby sitter, nor is our intent to leave them with our kids and we leave to go do our own thing away from the home. We are hoping/asking for them to come join us in our crazy on a Saturday for a few hours. Our kids are in daycare during the week and we both work full time. We are not looking for childcare solutions. Just a little relief from the crazy on a Saturday now and then! I also am asking mostly because my husband WANTS to have his family help and is heartbroken then don\u2019t want to help more. We can totally hire someone, easily, I am asking how (or if) it is appropriate for me to tell them directly that we would like THEIR involvement, specifically.", "created_utc": 1685850958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14006wf/wibta_if_i_spoke_to_my_in_laws_directly_about/", "score": 2036, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your in-laws aren\u2019t obligated to help you with your kids. If you need help, hire some help. You even say in the post that you are able to do so. It\u2019s sad that they don\u2019t want to come visit more, but I think your husband is taking the right approach. I don\u2019t see how making it clear that what you actually want them to do is work, not just visit, is going to make visiting any more appealing to them than it seems to be now.", "In your husband's family they speak in subtext.

This is your responsibility to figure this out. Your in laws raised their children. They cant be expected or demanded to help raise anyone else's.

It sounds like you wanted them to move all the way over to set up shop as your free babysitters, telling them to completely abandon their friends/family/lives in their previous location.\n\nYes, parenting is very hard and taxing with two young ones.  Other parents out there are sure to sympathize with you.  But that can\u2019t come as a shock or surprise.  Unless everyone specifically said \u201chelp with child care,\u201d not just making visits easier, then you\u2019re being an assuming AH by demanding they help with the kids.

However, you stated you had already discussed this with your husband, and he does not want to take that approach. Being that they are his parents, I would assume he is aware of what their boundaries are. If you would like to continue to have a good relationship with your in-laws (and presumably with your husband), please consider an alternative. If you have the means, hire a babysitter and take a night with your husband so you can decompress and have a night of child free enjoyment.", "YWBTA because asking for their help would put an expectation or burden on them that your husband is not comfortable with. You should respect his wishes on the matter. I don't think you would be the A H if, when you're speaking with them, you let them know that you both are overwhelmed. But they should decide if they want to offer their services or not. In the meantime, if you're drowning, don't wait around and wait for help to volunteer itself.

They have made the choice whether consciously or unconsciously to not be a resource for you and your husband. They moved to be closer to your family so it would be easier to visit. There\u2019s a huge difference between visiting your grandkids and taking care of them. Clearly they just want to be the grandparents who visit. You need to accept that.", "YTA it's his family so let him take the lead on how y'all interact with them.\n\nHonestly you messed up by having the kids so close together. Completely y'all's choice and on you to figure it out and get breaks from your kids. Your husband has repeatedly extended invitations for them to come visit.

It\u2019s simply a matter of different familial expectations that you don\u2019t really know you have until they aren\u2019t met.

It appears they may not be super interested in hands on help with the kids. If your husband isn\u2019t comfortable asking for help, then maybe it\u2019s easier if it comes from you. \n\nHiring a babysitter to help while you get other things done at home or so you can go to the store alone or go with you to take the kids to the park helps! We did a lot of divide & conquer with our kids. Grocery shopping at night was my favorite solo activity. Thankfully we also have a big family & amazing friends & neighbors. Sometimes you just need to wave the white flag & call in reinforcements.\n\nHaving 4 under 4 (now 25,25,27,29) I truly understand & empathize with your struggles right now. It does get easier ...

She had mother\u2019s helpers from the local university when they were very little specifically so she could either get something else done or have more 1:1 time with each kid.

Just some help during this early, really difficult phase. This is a really hard age gap in the beginning and you for sure should ask your support network for help. \n\nBut don't expect it. Definitely find and hire a good reliable sitter. Don't wait!", "Just to give you a break here:  I do think it would be okay to call them and have an open and frank discussion with them about needing help.

In other words, they will say the right words, but not do what they say. If you say anything you will either be ignored or complained about and badmouthed.

I know this is in the context of patently, but it ultimately seems like a communication/family culture issue more than anything else.\n\nMy husbands family is also not super direct and their communication style seems similar to how you describe your husbands family. My MIL went away and wanted to ask if my FIL could come to my house for dinner after dropping her at the airport, and it was 5 minutes until I understood what she was asking me. A few days later a similar thing happened with my FIL until he finally said \"I am actually asking if you could make the birthday cake\". \n\nOn the other hand, I have asked for things directly (can I take these lemons home?/can you help us move house this day?/can you drop that thing off tomorrow?) To varying degrees of success. Now I just ask my husband if I can ask something directly or if there is a better way, since I just don't know their communication and family culture intuitively.  For example, some things are better coming from him because their son and some things are better coming from me because of how they perceive gender roles. \n\nSo I think if you ask your husband whether you can ask directly first, you're NTA. That goes for anything, not just parenting stuff. \n\nP.s. I don't think you are entitled asking your family for help with your kids. That seems like a very normal thing to ask for help with.

Maybe your husband knows it and is processing the fact his parents don't care. It's a hard one to swallow.\n\nYou have two separate problems. Tackle one at the time. What I would do is ask a good friend or hire a babysitter and get some much needed respite. Or a cleaner. Or both, just for a month or two. Money might be tight but your mental health is more important than savings right now for a few weeks. \n\nTHEN when you're in a better place mentally and more rested, invite the in laws over and casually say \"Don't worry, we're not asking you to be free babysitters, we've hired/asked someone to help us with that already as we understand that's not something you want to do\". They can't really argue that fact, and if they don't take that hint you can put this to bed. \n\nYour husband (and yourself to a degree) are mourning for the idea of involved grandparents and some practical help (that they created when they said they wanted to move closer).

If all goes well, they will soon realise how important those hours of help means, and start offering more.\n\nThis sounds like your husband doesn't want to ask, because he doesn't want to come across as demanding. And his parents dont want to \"invite themselves\" for fear of intruding. \n\nMaybe they are even waiting for an invitation? \"Can you come this Saturday at 2?\" is perhaps what they need to hear? \n\nI know my inlaws were like this, very careful not to make me feel intruded upon.

That is what is insane here.\n\n\nOP, you need to get help, in general, it's not shameful, it does hurt to ask at first. Communication is the key, always. You need to be as direct with your partner as you want to be with the inlaws. You guys clearly need a break, also, you should explore other tools for the kids, for instance we had a hell of a time with our son when he was 2, it was until much later that we learned of 1-2-3 magic and while it itself the literal technique isn't a long term solution, really, it got me to think about the actual situation.\n\nThe most important part of the cycles of development is understanding the context of what their brains are developing and why.

There could be a fair discussion about what their needs are, what boundaries would need to be in place, how much of their time they would like to spend with their grandchildren. The important thing in having a conversation like that is creating an environment where they feel able to be honest without judgement. You and your husband would have to be receptive to any hesitations on their part, if they have any, and not place guilt on them.\n\nHe could also have a conversation with his parents about how much you're both struggling in order to ask for their ADVICE.

If they told you that they moved to spend more time with you, it's natural to be a little confused that they are not spending more time with you.

If they do not wish to help, then they can say no directly. They are his parents, not some stranger on the street.

For instance: plan to take the kiddos to the zoo, with a stop at a local small ice cream shop that you haven't been to, then a rousing game of Go-Fish or Candy Land before settling down to watch a movie no one has seen in awhile.

Since you would like some help and would also like your in laws more closely involved in your lives, try to start taking steps towards letting them know that you would like that involvement. I read that your husband communicates with his parents 90% of the time - perhaps there are some things you can do to show them how much you also want them in your lives. Try texting them cute photos and videos of the kids, share anecdotes, etc at least once a week  - maybe in a group message with you, your in laws, and your husband and generate some conversation. Think about FaceTiming with them.

I have brother-in-laws who made it clear that they\u2019re not super interested in being a part of my kids lives. And I don\u2019t begrudge that at all. They live their lives, we live our\u2019s. It means though that I don\u2019t make any special effort to do things like, pay for an all inclusive trip to Mexico with us, which I did do for my cousin who is super active in my kid\u2019s lives. She\u2019s constantly engaging with them, offering to take them to fun places. And so she pours into the relationship and we pour back in. Relationships shouldn\u2019t be a quid pro quo.

Four years later and I still think of him everyday, still have dreams at my grandmother's house where she died, I remember every detail of her home... \n\nI agree that it hurts even worse to have people dance or tip toe around talking about the peron who's died. I had to deal with that a lot when I lost my ex partner. Constantly had people trying to tell me to move on, too nervous to talk about him or bring up his name, but what helped me at that time was being able to talk about him and how I felt and not having anyone try to cheer me up or distract me. I needed to think and talk about him to grieve and it made me angry that others thought it was something I needed to move on from, the first time someone said that to me was only 3 months after he died. Death isn't something you move on from, it's something you move through. \n\nThankfully her husband's family has banded together full force during this time to help her and support her- and for many of them this probably won't be something they \"move on\" from any faster than she will.

Do you live in real society with other people?", "also 1.5 hours each way isnt exactly close. am I going to make a 3 hour roundtrip more often than a 6 hour round trip? for sure. am I going to do it often? no lol", "How is asking for help an assholish behavior? They've expressed the desire to spend more time with their grandkids, reaching out for help (when they haven't said they're not willing to help) is totally reasonable. I would really hope that my friends and family would be comfortable asking me for help when they want it.\n\nI hope no one is telling my loved ones that they're acting \"entitled\" because they might ask me for help now and then.", "Op isn't looking for a sitter. She just wants them to show the involvement they promised her husband.", "I agree with this take. I have some close friends who have 3 kids (7, 6, and 2) that I am also close with. They regularly ask me to come entertain the kids for a bit so they can get stuff done (especially when the youngest was a baby). Or just come watch them so they can get out of the house and get a break. Of course it's not my responsibility, but I'm their friend, and helping each other out when we need each other is what friends do. I've always told them that I don't mind helping (kind of like OP's in laws are doing here), and they never act entitled to my help. I personally don't see an issue at all with OP calling up the in laws and saying \"Hey, we are drowning in housework over here. Do y'all want to come spend some quality time with the kids for a bit while we catch up? We can have dinner after and get some quality time in with you too.\"", "> Seriously, what happened to the village?\n\nIt was local. \n\n\n>It's only been really the last 20 or so years\n\nGrandparents who don't want to babysit have existed since long before 2003.", "We are totally OK with a no, right now we are not getting a yes or a no because the invites and asks are not as direct as I think they couls be to create clarity", "It sounds like the moved closer to be able to more easily come to Christmas and grandparents day at school. An hour and a half is still a long way for someone who wants to be providing regular childcare.", "As a husband in an almost identical situation, after just having this kind of talk with my wife- I really don\u2019t know how to reach out to my parents about needing help from them. I feel like my parents are more of the type that if I\u2019m not reaching out to them, then they think they\u2019d be bothering us if they asked to come over more. Personally if my wife asked me if she could reach out to them I would love it. \n\nWe have a 3yo and a 1mo and this shit is hard. Anyone here saying things like \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to have kids that far apart!\u201d Or \u201cit was your choice don\u2019t put it on your in laws.\u201d DONT UNDERSTAND the kind of stress that is on you, your household, your marriage. And you know what, neither did I beforehand, it\u2019s one of those things that people who aren\u2019t there don\u2019t understand. You do what you need to to keep your family together.\n\nNTA, you ask your (husbands) parents for help if you need to- they don\u2019t know if you don\u2019t tell them.", "ABSOLUTELY! .... the question is should OP be direct. YES! Lay it all out there & if IL\u2019s want to help, they will. If they don\u2019t... No is an acceptable answer. No one has asked yet. Just ask the question. But please let\u2019s stop with the ... you don\u2019t get help because you chose to have children too close in age. \n\nNo one is giving their kids away or responsibilities .... they just want to clarify. Are you willing to help or not? That\u2019s a decision IL\u2019s will make. Not Reddit.", "Bless you, all your replies to everyone are so lovely. Best of luck to you all!", "You can get help in other forms. What about hiring cleaners to help with chores so you can focus on the kids during the weekend? Grocery delivery maybe? If you have the means, you can get help from sources other than grandparents.", "Maybe they are put off by OP not wanting to spend time with them, instead just wants their help.", "That\u2019s kinda all OP wants though - Saturday family lunch and some play time with the toddler while she does chores.", "The in laws chose to have kids too, and now those kids need help. It\u2019s also the in-laws responsibility. Since when is giving life to- the end of responsibility towards your kids?", "I agree about being direct. I'm not a fan of open invitations. I much prefer firmer plans with an actual date and time or range of time. I think being direct, inviting the parents over to hang out on a Saturday and asking them if they could help entertain the kids is a good idea. If they still don't show, then OP and her husband know that his parents don't actually care about helping much and they can move on to other ideas to get a break.", "I don't think they are holding back.  They actually were invited by OP's husband, and still chose not to visit more.\n\n Combined with husbands reluctancy to ask directly for help, I'd say respect the dynamic between husband and his parents. \n\nBecause if OP had a close enough relationship with her inlaws, she would not had needed to ask her husband to ask them for help, nor did she needed to ask here if she could. \n\nI feel it's a 'If you need to ask, the answer is no' situation"]}
