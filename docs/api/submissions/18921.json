You should respect his wishes on the matter. I don't think you would be the A H if, when you're speaking with them, you let them know that you both are overwhelmed.

Good luck, I have every faith in you and your husband. You've got this! Message me if you need to chat.", "If your husband wanted to, he would. If his parents wanted to help, they would. You can want more help but you can\u2019t go behind his back. Why can\u2019t your family help for a short break, or don\u2019t you feel able to ask? If not that kind of tells you something", ">i'm bummed that openly asking for a break or needing some help is seen so negatively \n\noh please. stop with the \"woe is me.\" no one is saying you needing a break is bad. your attitude of \"we need help, come give it to us\" is what makes you an asshole. if you need help, hire it.", "It's not the \"needing help\" part that makes you sound like an AH. It's more the tone in which you wrote the post, I think. It seems like you want to have your in-laws visit so you can tackle chores, etc. \n\nI get how tired you must be. That said, I suggest you just hire help - that way, no one's feelings get hurt. \n\nYour husband can talk to his parents when he's in a better state of mind. And I think his approach is way better because he's not obligating his parents to visit or help; he's just keeping the door open. \n\nI wish you all the best, OP. \ud83d\udc97", "I suspect a lot of that is coming from people who don't have kids, don't like kids, and wouldn't want to help. It's completely normal for parents of small children to ask their families for some help and most grandparents actively want to help. You're not an asshole for wanting help, but they're your husband's parents so I'd let him decide how to handle it.", "Completely fair! We did make the choice. You are right in that. I guess everything points to that we should just ride the rough waters for now and let it be! Thank you for validating my gut feeling that this would be an AH move.", "I assumed this was the case.  As the days/weeks/months grow long, only natural to need to vent somewhere.  To be fair, hitting up reddit to complain is probably the best option of all as you still get that release but don\u2019t directly dump on the grandparents.  Good on ya for not attacking anyone IRL put of sleep deprivation! Good luck out there <3", "Yes, focus on you, your partner and your family unit.\n\nOrganise paid care and enjoy each other's company.\n\nGood luck, parenting is hard.", "Please don\u2019t feel shame! It\u2019s so hard to be a parent to a young child, let alone two. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love them or don\u2019t value your time with them. It\u2019s just mentally and physically exhausting at the same time.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with your in laws but I will say that even if they did come babysit, having family babysit can often be more complicated than it seems if the relationship there is already strained in some way. It actually might be to your benefit to hire someone even if your in-laws were willing to help, because it\u2019s easier to set clear boundaries and get an actual break. Boundary setting is huge if you\u2019re trying to protect your mental health.\n\nAnd - if you suspect you might have PPD, have you talked to anyone about it? I had terrible PPA and getting help was life saving. I hope you have someone trusted you can ask for help - a doctor, therapist, etc.\n\nPlease don\u2019t let a bunch of internet strangers psych you out. You love your kids. You need a break. Both can be true. I hope you find the childcare you need to have some breathing room. And this too shall pass - like someone else said, as they get older, it\u2019ll get easier! \u2764\ufe0f", "Great feedback!", "If it\u2019s to the point that you are both having mental health struggles I\u2019d 100% tell them what\u2019s going on and ask if they are able to help out on a schedule for a couple months while you find a suitable nanny. You are still at risk for PPD, do not suffer in silence!", "Take care of yourself & never be shy or ashamed to ask for help. They\u2019re your kids 24/7. You\u2019re not trying to give them away you just need an extra set of hands to help & to take a break occasionally. Parents are no use to their kids if they are totally burnt out. \n\nAlso, your kids can never have too many people in their lives who love & care for them.... so the more the merrier for everyone! \n\nWish you all the best!", "I'm so surprised by the responses here. I remember how hard I found those early days so please don't let the Internet make you feel like a bad person for looking for a lifeline. I wouldnt recommend going around your husband but maybe encourage him to tell his parents how you are feeling and that you would really welcome some support. I know my in laws were always cautious not to step on my toes as a new mum so they might be holding off because they don't want to imposition you, by staying or being in your space. Best to make it really clear.", "I agree NTA. They could be giving you some \u201cspace\u201d to settle in with your youngest, or having issues with driving etc but they clearly don\u2019t understand that you have been struggling because your husband hasn\u2019t told them. \nIf they won\u2019t come to visit you then go to them. This worked pretty well with my in laws, the journey was horrible but having two extra pairs of eyes to watch the eldest and someone else to engage with them was helpful. And, get a babysitter or swap time off with your husband so you can do something on your own occasionally even if it just going to the supermarket.", "I hope you give it a try.  It may work out well for everyone.", "You are so so sweet! Thank you for these tips. I will try some of them for sure. \n\nCan\u2019t wait for our kids to be 4 and 2!!!!", "It\u2019s not about \u2018not having or liking kids\u2019, it\u2019s that she\u2019d be going behind her partner\u2019s back. They clearly don\u2019t want to help, or they would. It\u2019s natural to want help, but it isn\u2019t coming. If you can afford help, it\u2019s just churlish to expect his parents to come instead when they won\u2019t.", "Thank you for your feedback! It sounds like a part time nanny or sitter is going to be the best option for us.", "Thank you! Yes, the little one is only 4 months. Thank you for your feedback! We will totally look into a part time nanny!", "It's the best! My eldest calls his brother his best friend. Sure they fight sometimes, but they genuinely get on so well 80% of the time. We're starting to get out of toddler boot camp, and I feel more sane now \ud83d\ude05"]}
