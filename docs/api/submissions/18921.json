I know this is in the context of patently, but it ultimately seems like a communication/family culture issue more than anything else.\n\nMy husbands family is also not super direct and their communication style seems similar to how you describe your husbands family. My MIL went away and wanted to ask if my FIL could come to my house for dinner after dropping her at the airport, and it was 5 minutes until I understood what she was asking me. A few days later a similar thing happened with my FIL until he finally said \"I am actually asking if you could make the birthday cake\". \n\nOn the other hand, I have asked for things directly (can I take these lemons home?/can you help us move house this day?/can you drop that thing off tomorrow?) To varying degrees of success. Now I just ask my husband if I can ask something directly or if there is a better way, since I just don't know their communication and family culture intuitively.  For example, some things are better coming from him because their son and some things are better coming from me because of how they perceive gender roles. \n\nSo I think if you ask your husband whether you can ask directly first, you're NTA. That goes for anything, not just parenting stuff. \n\nP.s. I don't think you are entitled asking your family for help with your kids. That seems like a very normal thing to ask for help with.

Maybe your husband knows it and is processing the fact his parents don't care. It's a hard one to swallow.\n\nYou have two separate problems. Tackle one at the time. What I would do is ask a good friend or hire a babysitter and get some much needed respite. Or a cleaner. Or both, just for a month or two. Money might be tight but your mental health is more important than savings right now for a few weeks. \n\nTHEN when you're in a better place mentally and more rested, invite the in laws over and casually say \"Don't worry, we're not asking you to be free babysitters, we've hired/asked someone to help us with that already as we understand that's not something you want to do\". They can't really argue that fact, and if they don't take that hint you can put this to bed. \n\nYour husband (and yourself to a degree) are mourning for the idea of involved grandparents and some practical help (that they created when they said they wanted to move closer).

If all goes well, they will soon realise how important those hours of help means, and start offering more.\n\nThis sounds like your husband doesn't want to ask, because he doesn't want to come across as demanding. And his parents dont want to \"invite themselves\" for fear of intruding. \n\nMaybe they are even waiting for an invitation? \"Can you come this Saturday at 2?\" is perhaps what they need to hear? \n\nI know my inlaws were like this, very careful not to make me feel intruded upon.

I accept that your husband's way of wording it does not explain that you need help.

You\u2019re in-laws are not actually obligated to help you with the kids. You could sit down and have a frank discussion, say that you\u2019re both struggling and if they\u2019re willing to help out for a little while - with a *fixed* time frame - then it would be appreciated.

Quite apart from them not being obligated, they\u2019ve clearly had the opportunity to become more involved and have chosen not to, chances are they will choose not to again. Reacting aggressively or negatively will simply reinforce this already distant behaviour\n\n3) your husband needs to be in agreement before you go ahead with it. They\u2019re *his* parents. His relationship with them is more complex and nuanced than yours. You\u2019ve already said he\u2019s upset about them not being more involved of their own choice. Read between the lines: it\u2019s not just about not wanting to beg them into seeing your kid, he\u2019s saying he shouldn\u2019t have to beg them to have an on-going relationship with *him*.

There\u2019s every chance that they\u2019re the kind of people who wild demand gratitude beyond what your husband is willing to give for the sake of doing favours.", "Seems like a you problem mate. You knew what you were getting into with kids.\n\nYTA", "NTA, if my husband and I needed to go out (birthday, wedding etc) or one of our kids is sick and can't go to school/daycare (but we're both working) we ask the grandparents to help out. Luckily they live around the corner and adore their grandkids so it's no problem and we try to treat them to dinner, flowers etc every so often to say thanks. Asking for help now and again (obviously not a lot) is fine. Them saying no is also fine. I don't see the harm in asking in a nice way & not expecting too much especially as an hour and a half away is still quite far. The fact that they don't seem to want to visit though is a bit telling \ud83d\ude2c.", "YWBTA. I think your husband is right, he already asked and they still haven\u2019t come. While I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to ask for help, this is something that has been asked a few times with no success, they clearly don\u2019t want to, for some reason or another the answer as of now is still no. And TBH might be for the best, I personally wouldn\u2019t want someone watching my kids when I already know that\u2019s not something they want to do. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re in the position to hire a nanny, definitely do that.", "YTA you and your husband. His parents aren\u2019t. 1.5 hours is still a long way to travel. A three hour round trip to work as a nanny for you is a big ask. They did their child rearing and while I agree some help would be nice, they are in no way obligated to do any of it.\n\nYou\u2019d like a closer relationship, that\u2019s understandable. You\u2019d like more people pitching in with the kids you\u2019ve brought into the world. Also understandable. You are not entitled to it however. \n\nYour failure to cope is not their problem to solve. You have to do that yourself. Put your foot down and hire help. Right now you are letting your husbands desire for a different relationship with his parents actively hurt your ability to care for your kids. He\u2019s prioritising an imaginary relationship over his own kid\u2019s needs. And you are letting him. That\u2019s what makes you both assholes here. \n\nYou are both party to hurting your kids in the long run if you can\u2019t cope. Just get outside help given you\u2019ve suggested you can afford it.", "YWBTA if you asked, yes. I'm sorry but it doesn't seem like they want to be involved in that way, at the moment. \n\nI dont care if people have \"done it themselves\" it doesn't mean others should have to do it tough if there is help, but sadly, it doesn't appear that way with your in-laws.\n\nWhatever their reasons, I hope you and your husband are able to get through this and thrive. Hopefully your kids will want you around if they go on to have families.\n\nCongratulations on the new addition, and I love that you are mindful of spending time with your toddler.", "It would be more appealing to me. When my family are struggling I go straight over to help. That\u2019s what families do. It might not be very appealing to go and sit in a chaotic house for a \u2018social\u2019 visit, but to have your child say they need support because they\u2019re struggling? I don\u2019t get the issue", "Since when is asking for help an asshole move?  The in laws probably aren\u2019t aware of how difficult things are for op and partner if they never express it. Isn\u2019t this why we have friends and family? To help each other?", "I think you could frame it as \"hey! Just wanted to reach out and ask if you guys have any free time / afternoon , and would like to take kids or older kid to beach/woods/playground no problem if you aren't available of course!\" It is no joke having children and , I personally love when people ask me to watch their kids,  it is a huge compliment. However, you WBTA if you were upset when they say no. \nI have been at that stage. It is hard. You need a village. If the village doesn't come , hire it ! \nI have no-one around me that will take the kids to allow me a break, so I have a nanny and a cleaner & work a part time job to pay for it", "Yes it's like they are doing the in laws a favour for offering to come and help them with the kids they chose to have.\n\nSorry OP but YTA", "Nobody helped you at all? Fantastic you were able to do that. Doesn\u2019t make it wrong to need help sometimes, and reach out to family.", "I have the world's most dysfunctional in-laws, so this may just be a \"me\" thing, but I always let my husband deal with his family and stayed out of it. He understood their messed up dynamic and the history behind it.  My family has its own dysfunctions and its own history, so likewise, my family was my responsibility. \n\nMy advice would be that your husband knows how to speak to his parents. If he says it's a bad idea, listen to him.", "This is maybe not the right sub for this topic. People here will always call parents the asshole, especially parents who feel \u201centitled\u201d to ask for help. \n\nPerhaps try one of the parenting advice subs like r/beyondthebump. You\u2019re not the first parents to go through this experience, and it\u2019s good to see how others have coped (either successfully or unsuccessfully).\n\nIn case you need to hear it: you\u2019re not an asshole for needing help. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for it. (But also don\u2019t expect it and don\u2019t get upset if someone says no)", "I guess I am coming from a single mum\u2019s perspective but there are two of you. Why not take turns giving each other a break?  If the in-laws wanted to be there, they would be. I mean, NTA but you do have a husband to juggle the load with.", "My mother wants grandchildren so much I\u2019ve joked to her that I\u2019ll have to go into witness protection to keep her away from my baby \ud83d\ude02, my mother in law is active and always has been with her current grandchildren too, this I\u2019m afraid are just two grandparents who simply don\u2019t have the baby bug and may be far more interested in enjoying older life, child free. I can truly appreciate how shit it must feel for your husband but if they wanted to be there, they would although I find it a bit cringe they sold their house move on a lie about wanting to be closer to the kids, I mean why lie in the first place?\n\nEdit: I think you the worst case scenario you do let them know you could do with some help and that you\u2019ve been struggling a little and they say no, so long as you accept that and leave it at that, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be the asshole", "Also, they chose to have the kids so close together, why should anyone else care?", "\ud83c\udfc6", "People cant take care of one kid and they decide to have a second one while the first one is still a toddler.\ud83e\udd26 and then they ask for help from parents under the guise of visiting who unless they have forced them to have kids, have no responsibility. You reap what you sow", "It's completely fine and understandable to want a break. I had my own kids with much larger age gaps because I knew I couldn't handle 2 under 2.\n\nHowever other people are not obligated to help. I do agree it's a bit weird your husband can't ask directly about them babysitting for a couple of hours if you are so overwhelmed. Asking is fine if you accept no for an answer. However, as it seems your PIL are not willing to help/your H is not willing to ask I'd hire a babysitter if possible. If not, take turns taking breaks?", "Sweets. Don't beat yourself up. This is HARD. Crazy hard. It's OK to feel overwhelmed. It's ok to wish your kids would just STFU. No one can blame you for seeking help. In fact, it's healthy to do that. \n\nYou've identified that you and your partner need a break. Sounds like this is a 'throw money at the problem' situation. Do it!", "OP, this sub is probably not the right place for most posters to empathise with you. The \"your kids your problems\" brigade is strong here. \n\nI was where you are when I had my second. And went to counselling for PPD, and after 5 sessions the lady said \"you don't have PPD, you are in need of a full night sleep, a brunch with your partner and a back massage\". Sleep deprivation and going from 1 to 2 was absolutely the toughest time in my life, but if you can hire help, absolutely do that. \n\nAnother thing, with hired help, you will get no judgement. No \"I didn't struggle when I had my kids\", no resentment, no comments on the state of your house, no huffing. Maybe invite them for the little one's 6 months as a mini \"half year\" celebration, or to the 2 years old's birthday. No pressure. And hire the rest out. \n\nThere is also the fact your children are super young and your in laws may be completely freaked out by the thought of being put in charge of under2s. My parents definitely were. I could step away for a shower, but absolutely not anything longer than that.", "No one at all my youngest was a month old when the father left and the pendamic and lock down happend ..\nYes i agree but it doesn't give her any right to expect the grandparents to take responsibility while they visit just because they live closer", "\ud83d\ude44 Oh please. Plenty of people read you full post, and came to the same conclusion. You chose to have children. Why is it anyone else's responsibility, to look after them? For free none the less... If you need a break, hire help. Of course parents are allowed to have hard days, but parents like you, sound extremely entitled. You're in-laws are not your free babysitters. You shouldn't expect help, which I feel is what you're doing. These are your children, your responsibility! Your 'oh, poor me' attitude, is not a good look.", "I did read your post.        \nYou obviously didn\u2019t read my response.      \nI said that they probably don\u2019t visit you because they know you want them to \u2018help\u2019 with the kids.          \nNobody said you can\u2019t have a hard day.     \nWe are simply saying your hard day is your responsibility not you ILs", "I wonder if they already get the drift that the invites have all been for them to provide support, rather than genuine invitations to say come over for dinner etc as a family or to go somewhere together?\n\nI'm of the opinion, as a mother, that my child is my responsibility and that yes, you chose to have 2 under 2. You should have thought through the logistics long before dtd and conceiving!\n\nI do find it bizarre that you'd need so much additional support when there is clearly two involved parents tbh. Perhaps rather than immediately go to employing someone, maybe look at how and what it is that's the issue. Try reframing. Eg. Is the toddler napping - if so what do you do during that time? Can you coincide some of the meal times so that toddler is eating and baby can be fed at that time at the dinner table? Do you have a routine - not necessarily one that's restrictive, but am obvious pattern? Toddler can certainly be involved with housework etc.", "Let\u2019s be honest, they moved 1.5 hours away.  They didn\u2019t want to be more involved, they just wanted a shorter drive for when they were already planning on coming (say birthdays or Christmas).", "I think her question is more , she wants to let them know that they would like help. OH isn't communicating so she wants to discuss it with them? I think it is OK to be open with in laws here. They did move to come closer , maybe they don't want to intrude and are waiting for the invite OH isn't extending.", "Standing ovation.", "She\u2019s doing the opposite of expecting, she wants to ask for help which seems totally reasonable if they moved closer to see them more", "Where is your grace? OP isn\u2019t perfect, fine. They\u2019ve not been rude or hectoring or mean, they\u2019re just stressed out and asking if this would be appropriate. No \u201cextreme entitlement\u201d, but I guess something about parenting posts brings out all the misanthropic teens.", "I did specifically say that she should not go behind her parents' back, but I think there's a high proportion of people on this sub who can't imagine that ANYONE would want to help out with small children, and that's not been my experience.", "except he is? op literally states that he tells them \u201ccome over *if you want*.\u201d op isn\u2019t satisfied and rather he\u2019d say \u201cwe need help *can you come over*.\u201d while the statement includes \u201ccan,\u201d that phrase is still a demand.", "You could also bite a cleaner a couple  times a week and that will take the pressure off and allow you to enjoy stress free time with your kids."]}
