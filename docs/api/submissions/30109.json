First off, she was blindsided, and it is your fault. How did you not walk her through these rituals and traditions beforehand? Secondly, even if she did know about it, it is up to her whether she wants to do it or not.  Maybe if you explained properly - it\u2019s not a slavery thing, more of respect, for blessings etc - she may have agreed.  But if she\u2019s from a culture where that is actually looked down upon (like in Islam, for instance), then I don\u2019t see how her not doing it unreasonable. \n\nYou need to have a hard look at your equation with your wife, because from this, it does not sound like you respect her or treat her like an equal. And honestly to not just let this go and try to almost blackmail her by telling her that the ceremony was incomplete without this (which, by the way, is categorically untrue) - when she agreed for the ceremony to be done in your cultural traditions and not hers - is crazy.  She literally met you 99% of the way, and you met her zero percent - and you are still complaining and nitpicking. That doesn\u2019t reflect an equal partnership - it reflects that you want full control.", ">...both of us were supposed to touch the feet of the groom's parents.

She had no idea what it symbolized or what it means to you and your parents. Had you done so PRIOR to the wedding, she might have been fine with it.\n\nDude.

You blindsided your bride and are now surprised she didn't want to pay obeisance to your parents in a custom no one explained to her.\n\nYou've only got yourself to blame here...but you won't take the responsibility which reinforces that YTA.", "YTA. She obviously wasn\u2019t expecting that part of the ceremony. If she had, I\u2019m sure she would have nixed it. \n\nSo, either-\n1. You failed to properly prepare her \nOR\n2. You knew her well enough that she wouldn\u2019t want to do it and you thought you\u2019d sneak it in and she\u2019d just go with it to avoid a scene.\n\nI\u2019m going with the second one. As someone who has been a bride before, there was no part of that day that I didn\u2019t help plan or have input in, not a single minute. \n\nEither way you are the cause of this \u201cembarrassment\u201d because you obviously have no respect for your new wife or women in general. I suspect, if she were fully aware of your feelings, perhaps she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to marry you. She made it very clear to you that she had no intention of bowing down to anyone and I don\u2019t blame her. Women are second class citizens in many parts of the world. \u201cShe knows her worth\u201d and good for her!", "YTA. 2 major problems here: One anyone who has lived in the west (and I suspect many other cultures) would know that the symbolism of this \"tradition\" would be seen as demeaning to the wife, indicating subservience to the grooms parents.  The second is that you never brought this up before the actual ceremony. My guess is that that you probably didn't tell her because knew she wouldn't like it and were either too scared of your families opinion or too indifferent to your wife's feelings to mention this. In any case I salute her for standing up for herself and think that this marriage will probably be short lived.", "YTA\n\n\nIf she was briefed on this custom and had agreed to it, this reaction wouldn't have happened.\n\nSo either you didn't actually tell her the details/omitted it, or you surprised her on the day hoping that the social pressure would make her conform.\n\nHer reaction is totally understandable. Its also highly symbolic of lowering herself as a woman in the groom does not also touch the bride's feet id imagine.", "YTA\n\nYou owed it to her to explain it ALL before she agreed to use your customs. And I personally would have flipped out on you and your parents at that request. \n\nYou caused the issue by not making the expectation clear.", "I can promise you that everybody will tell you that YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE  !!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou  did not explain the tradition to your wife and she has the right to refuse to do that ....\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust leave her alone and stay single until you grow up and learn to communicate", "It sounds to me as if you lied by omission. If this was run by her previously, why would she be confused when that part of the ceremony came up? Sounds to me like you didn't actually tell her this part beforehand. Agreeing to a \"traditional\" wedding is not the same thing as being explicitly told about that one particular part. She also wouldn't have followed up with \"what in the world is that about?\" if she had known this was coming. YTA.", "YTA, I am indian and I know exactly what ritual you are talking about. **Certain customs need to be explained first.** You can't blindly tell people to follow certain gestures  at the last moment that may mean different things in different places. Specifically in my family, the bride and groom touch the feet of both parents at different occasions during the marriage ceremony asking for their blessings for a successful marriage. It is an act of showing respect in Indian culture. you do it to god, your teachers, elders, older siblings etc. The act of bowing symbolizes the recognition of divinity in the other person. This all should have been explained before when you guys were planning the wedding. **You all should have sat through and discussed what each component in the wedding means and decided on what components you both are comfortable with.**", "YTA, big time. I cannot believe you did not ONCE mention to her prior to the ceremony that this would be required/expected as part of a traditional wedding! It is one thing to agree to do a traditional ceremony according to your partner's culture IN THEORY, but she cannot expected to know every aspect of what that means in practice unless you tell her. She didn't cause a disturbance in your wedding, you ambushed her with something you should have known was not a given that a woman not of your culture would be okay with and hoped she'd feel pressured into it. I'm not going to comment on whether the tradition itself is appropriate to continue in modern times, but it is something that needed to be discussed and it's not a neutral thing to have in your ceremony like wearing a certain color.", "You didn't even explain this to her in advance or ask for her opinion. She told you clearly what she thought but you didn't listen to her.\n\n>I held down my temper\n\nWhy should you be angry? What did she expect you to do that you found humiliating? YTA.", "INFO\n\nYou didn't explain your culture's tradition BEFORE the wedding?\n\n>especially when she had agreed to hold the wedding that way.\n\nThat means nothing if she didn't know what she was agreeing to.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine you actually told her about this requirement before the wedding. Was that because you knew how she would react? Or are you that clueless that you didn\u2019t think it would be an issue for her?", "YTA -- she is definitely not.\n\nIf this was part of the wedding in your culture then that should have been explained to her from the very beginnning so this conversation could have been held in private. Instead you shocked her with it.\n\nI can't blame her - bowing and touching the feet of someone symbolizes submitting to their authority. To you it might show respect but it is a VERY loaded gesture and I can't blame her for feeling angry.\n\nYou brought this on yourself Dude. You could have accepted her decision gracefully but YOU are the one who made a scene in front of others and caused the argument.", "You have a strong wife. Wanna keep her? Because that's not how you treat your partner.", "YTA. If you expect someone to follow your cultural preferences, you should review those ahead of time and make sure they're ok with it.  Also, starting a conversation with \"you insulted me in front of everyone\" is a sure fire way to cause a no win argument.", "YTA and WTF??????\n\nYou didn\u2019t fill her in on that little detail?? Well aren\u2019t you the idiot\u2026\u2026.what a ridiculous thing not to discuss earlier - as much as I think its a disgusting tradition -  you need to tell your significant other what a tradition is and what is expected prior to the service you twit.", "YTA she agreed to get married with customs that were not her own, but yours.  It was your responsibility to explain those to her, and what she would be expected to do.  You didn't.", "YTA Before she agreed to hold a wedding that would follow cultural traditions she is unfamiliar with you should have told her exactly what traditions she was agreeing to.", "YTA, and I assume part of a soon to be annulled marriage. You clearly did not explain this part of the wedding tradition to her beforehand, or she wouldn't have been confused when it happened. Why would you not? Why would you not have a rehearsal where you go through *everything*? Then she would have known, you could have eliminated that, and no embarrassment. Seems the likely reason is you knew she wouldn't go for it, and you hoped social pressure would force her to go along and bow to your parents.", "YTA, massively. As an Indian i know the meaning behind the gesture of touching an elder's feet but your wife would obviously not. It was YOUR job to walk her through all this stuff and explain the significance. And then it was up to HER to agree or not. You, sir, are an AH for not doing this prep work before the wedding.\n\nDouble YTA for not appreciating her for marrying according to your culture and enduring what it all entails. Indian weddings are gruelling affairs, and brutal on the bride, groom and even the guests. Instead you doubled down and accused her of being difficult. \n\nYTA yet again for the blatant lie that the  ceremonies wouldn't be complete without taking your parents' aashirwad. Actually that one makes me think that this is just rage bait. I hope it is.", "Why on earth didn\u2019t you explain the cultural significance and meaning of it. Just touch their feet? No wonder she reacted like that. That\u2019s weird\n\nI didn\u2019t think to look up and explain beforehand, the cultural significance and showing respect to parents, etc..\n\nI found this from google: \n\nThe practice of touching the feet of elders was adopted in India during the Vedic period and is called Charan Sparsh (charan means 'feet' and sparsh means 'touch'). According to the Hindu tradition, when you touch the feet of an elder person, you are in turn blessed with knowledge, intellect, strength and fame.Dec 21, 2022\n\nYTA.", "YTA for not explaining beforehand and then having the audacity to be mad she didn't follow just because you told her so.", "YTA - Did you never tell her BEFORE the ceremony what she was to expect?

Our parents had explained it to hers', who in turn said they would tell her about it. Apparently her parents did not inform her.\n\nYTA. This is absolutely ridiculous. \"I wasn't assigned to even explain it.\" Who is the one getting married? Who is the one that this custom is so important to? What a ridiculous response. I bet you're a joy in the workplace.\n\nIf something cultural was going to be a big insult to you if she didn't do it, it was up to you to explain it to her and ask her nicely to do it.", "YTA because how in the world did you not discuss this bit with her before the ceremony?", "YTA. This sounds fake. How do you get through months and months of wedding planning and the wife only learns this \u201cimportant cultural\u201d thing as it\u2019s happening?\n\nI kind of refuse to believe this was never mentioned. That would still make you the asshole, of course.\n\nBut this just sounds insanely fake", "YTA and an kind of an idiot. \n\nGood for your wife for refusing and not being coerced into a surprise weird tradition she knew nothing about.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't explain your cultural wedding practices to her prior to the wedding, so she had no idea she agreed to this.

Frankly it does reek of forced submission.", "(Edit- info was answered)  was she aware of this custom before hand?\n\nEdit due to your edit- YTA\n\n\nThe answer is apparently \"no\", because it was left to someone else to tell her.

When she was asked to do that, though, she looked confused, and then slightly angry. She asked me what in the world that's about, and I told it's how it's done.\n\nShe straight-up refused, causing a disturbance in the wedding. It was mentioned that it's necessary as it would not get \"completed\" otherwise, but she mentioned that she's not going to bow down and that she knows what she's worth. It resulted in an argument, and in the end we did not go through that.\n\nLater I told her that she insulted me in front of everyone, especially when she had agreed to hold the wedding that way. But she said that no matter how it's held, touching someone's feet like she's a slave is not what she would do in a million years.

To show how much I respect you, allow me to touch your feet and ask for you to bless this union.\" Also, in Hinduism, we often bow down to our Gods and touch their feet when praying as well, because it shows the utter humility of man. It shows that we are humbling ourselves before God. \n\nSimilarly, BOTH the bride and groom vow to treat each other's parents well, like God (but obviously not tolerate abuse from them). Women are also seen as Gods, children, husbands, etc. in our culture. We will sometimes touch our children's feet on their birthdays, maybe as a playful joke (because we see them as God-like), or maybe they'll touch their parents (it's never forced) as a way of saying thank you for giving birth to me, our parents if we are saying goodbye and won't see them for a long time, simply on a random day because we love our husbands, when it's a festival dedicated to women, and so on. \n\nIt's not just done when a couple gets married, but is incredibly common for both men and women to do. For example, if I'm close with my boss, and they've given me a promotion, as a man, I might bow down and touch my friend's/boss's feet as a thank you. That's not weird, it's just our culture. If you can't understand our culture, don't demean it and act like it's abusive.

For example, in Christian weddings, the father gives away the bride. Is that misogynstic? Is it saying he owns her and she's his property? No. It's just a part of their culture. Once you get married, you should try to understand your partner's culture, even though he shouldn't have ambushed her with it. It literally lasts a few seconds.
