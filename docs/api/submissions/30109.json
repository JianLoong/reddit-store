First off, she was blindsided, and it is your fault. How did you not walk her through these rituals and traditions beforehand? Secondly, even if she did know about it, it is up to her whether she wants to do it or not.  Maybe if you explained properly - it\u2019s not a slavery thing, more of respect, for blessings etc - she may have agreed.  But if she\u2019s from a culture where that is actually looked down upon (like in Islam, for instance), then I don\u2019t see how her not doing it unreasonable. \n\nYou need to have a hard look at your equation with your wife, because from this, it does not sound like you respect her or treat her like an equal. And honestly to not just let this go and try to almost blackmail her by telling her that the ceremony was incomplete without this (which, by the way, is categorically untrue) - when she agreed for the ceremony to be done in your cultural traditions and not hers - is crazy.  She literally met you 99% of the way, and you met her zero percent - and you are still complaining and nitpicking. That doesn\u2019t reflect an equal partnership - it reflects that you want full control.", ">...both of us were supposed to touch the feet of the groom's parents.

You blindsided your bride and are now surprised she didn't want to pay obeisance to your parents in a custom no one explained to her.\n\nYou've only got yourself to blame here...but you won't take the responsibility which reinforces that YTA.", "YTA. She obviously wasn\u2019t expecting that part of the ceremony. If she had, I\u2019m sure she would have nixed it. \n\nSo, either-\n1. You failed to properly prepare her \nOR\n2. You knew her well enough that she wouldn\u2019t want to do it and you thought you\u2019d sneak it in and she\u2019d just go with it to avoid a scene.\n\nI\u2019m going with the second one. As someone who has been a bride before, there was no part of that day that I didn\u2019t help plan or have input in, not a single minute. \n\nEither way you are the cause of this \u201cembarrassment\u201d because you obviously have no respect for your new wife or women in general. I suspect, if she were fully aware of your feelings, perhaps she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to marry you. She made it very clear to you that she had no intention of bowing down to anyone and I don\u2019t blame her. Women are second class citizens in many parts of the world. \u201cShe knows her worth\u201d and good for her!", "YTA. 2 major problems here: One anyone who has lived in the west (and I suspect many other cultures) would know that the symbolism of this \"tradition\" would be seen as demeaning to the wife, indicating subservience to the grooms parents.  The second is that you never brought this up before the actual ceremony. My guess is that that you probably didn't tell her because knew she wouldn't like it and were either too scared of your families opinion or too indifferent to your wife's feelings to mention this. In any case I salute her for standing up for herself and think that this marriage will probably be short lived.", "YTA\n\n\nIf she was briefed on this custom and had agreed to it, this reaction wouldn't have happened.\n\nSo either you didn't actually tell her the details/omitted it, or you surprised her on the day hoping that the social pressure would make her conform.\n\nHer reaction is totally understandable. Its also highly symbolic of lowering herself as a woman in the groom does not also touch the bride's feet id imagine.", "YTA\n\nYou owed it to her to explain it ALL before she agreed to use your customs. And I personally would have flipped out on you and your parents at that request. \n\nYou caused the issue by not making the expectation clear.", "I can promise you that everybody will tell you that YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE  !!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou  did not explain the tradition to your wife and she has the right to refuse to do that ....\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust leave her alone and stay single until you grow up and learn to communicate", "It sounds to me as if you lied by omission. If this was run by her previously, why would she be confused when that part of the ceremony came up? Sounds to me like you didn't actually tell her this part beforehand. Agreeing to a \"traditional\" wedding is not the same thing as being explicitly told about that one particular part. She also wouldn't have followed up with \"what in the world is that about?\" if she had known this was coming. YTA.", "YTA, I am indian and I know exactly what ritual you are talking about. **Certain customs need to be explained first.** You can't blindly tell people to follow certain gestures  at the last moment that may mean different things in different places. Specifically in my family, the bride and groom touch the feet of both parents at different occasions during the marriage ceremony asking for their blessings for a successful marriage. It is an act of showing respect in Indian culture. you do it to god, your teachers, elders, older siblings etc. The act of bowing symbolizes the recognition of divinity in the other person. This all should have been explained before when you guys were planning the wedding. **You all should have sat through and discussed what each component in the wedding means and decided on what components you both are comfortable with.**", "YTA, big time. I cannot believe you did not ONCE mention to her prior to the ceremony that this would be required/expected as part of a traditional wedding! It is one thing to agree to do a traditional ceremony according to your partner's culture IN THEORY, but she cannot expected to know every aspect of what that means in practice unless you tell her. She didn't cause a disturbance in your wedding, you ambushed her with something you should have known was not a given that a woman not of your culture would be okay with and hoped she'd feel pressured into it. I'm not going to comment on whether the tradition itself is appropriate to continue in modern times, but it is something that needed to be discussed and it's not a neutral thing to have in your ceremony like wearing a certain color.", "You didn't even explain this to her in advance or ask for her opinion. She told you clearly what she thought but you didn't listen to her.\n\n>I held down my temper\n\nWhy should you be angry? What did she expect you to do that you found humiliating? YTA.", "INFO\n\nYou didn't explain your culture's tradition BEFORE the wedding?\n\n>especially when she had agreed to hold the wedding that way.\n\nThat means nothing if she didn't know what she was agreeing to.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine you actually told her about this requirement before the wedding. Was that because you knew how she would react? Or are you that clueless that you didn\u2019t think it would be an issue for her?", "YTA -- she is definitely not.\n\nIf this was part of the wedding in your culture then that should have been explained to her from the very beginnning so this conversation could have been held in private. Instead you shocked her with it.\n\nI can't blame her - bowing and touching the feet of someone symbolizes submitting to their authority. To you it might show respect but it is a VERY loaded gesture and I can't blame her for feeling angry.\n\nYou brought this on yourself Dude. You could have accepted her decision gracefully but YOU are the one who made a scene in front of others and caused the argument.", "You have a strong wife. Wanna keep her? Because that's not how you treat your partner.", "YTA. If you expect someone to follow your cultural preferences, you should review those ahead of time and make sure they're ok with it.  Also, starting a conversation with \"you insulted me in front of everyone\" is a sure fire way to cause a no win argument.", "YTA and WTF??????\n\nYou didn\u2019t fill her in on that little detail?? Well aren\u2019t you the idiot\u2026\u2026.what a ridiculous thing not to discuss earlier - as much as I think its a disgusting tradition -  you need to tell your significant other what a tradition is and what is expected prior to the service you twit.", "YTA she agreed to get married with customs that were not her own, but yours.  It was your responsibility to explain those to her, and what she would be expected to do.  You didn't.", "YTA Before she agreed to hold a wedding that would follow cultural traditions she is unfamiliar with you should have told her exactly what traditions she was agreeing to.", "YTA, and I assume part of a soon to be annulled marriage. You clearly did not explain this part of the wedding tradition to her beforehand, or she wouldn't have been confused when it happened. Why would you not? Why would you not have a rehearsal where you go through *everything*? Then she would have known, you could have eliminated that, and no embarrassment. Seems the likely reason is you knew she wouldn't go for it, and you hoped social pressure would force her to go along and bow to your parents.", "YTA, massively. As an Indian i know the meaning behind the gesture of touching an elder's feet but your wife would obviously not. It was YOUR job to walk her through all this stuff and explain the significance. And then it was up to HER to agree or not. You, sir, are an AH for not doing this prep work before the wedding.\n\nDouble YTA for not appreciating her for marrying according to your culture and enduring what it all entails. Indian weddings are gruelling affairs, and brutal on the bride, groom and even the guests. Instead you doubled down and accused her of being difficult. \n\nYTA yet again for the blatant lie that the  ceremonies wouldn't be complete without taking your parents' aashirwad. Actually that one makes me think that this is just rage bait. I hope it is.", "Why on earth didn\u2019t you explain the cultural significance and meaning of it. Just touch their feet? No wonder she reacted like that. That\u2019s weird\n\nI didn\u2019t think to look up and explain beforehand, the cultural significance and showing respect to parents, etc..\n\nI found this from google: \n\nThe practice of touching the feet of elders was adopted in India during the Vedic period and is called Charan Sparsh (charan means 'feet' and sparsh means 'touch'). According to the Hindu tradition, when you touch the feet of an elder person, you are in turn blessed with knowledge, intellect, strength and fame.Dec 21, 2022\n\nYTA.", "YTA for not explaining beforehand and then having the audacity to be mad she didn't follow just because you told her so.", "YTA - Did you never tell her BEFORE the ceremony what she was to expect?

I bet you're a joy in the workplace.\n\nIf something cultural was going to be a big insult to you if she didn't do it, it was up to you to explain it to her and ask her nicely to do it.", "YTA because how in the world did you not discuss this bit with her before the ceremony?", "YTA. This sounds fake. How do you get through months and months of wedding planning and the wife only learns this \u201cimportant cultural\u201d thing as it\u2019s happening?\n\nI kind of refuse to believe this was never mentioned. That would still make you the asshole, of course.\n\nBut this just sounds insanely fake", "YTA and an kind of an idiot. \n\nGood for your wife for refusing and not being coerced into a surprise weird tradition she knew nothing about.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't explain your cultural wedding practices to her prior to the wedding, so she had no idea she agreed to this.

When she was asked to do that, though, she looked confused, and then slightly angry. She asked me what in the world that's about, and I told it's how it's done.\n\nShe straight-up refused, causing a disturbance in the wedding. It was mentioned that it's necessary as it would not get \"completed\" otherwise, but she mentioned that she's not going to bow down and that she knows what she's worth. It resulted in an argument, and in the end we did not go through that.\n\nLater I told her that she insulted me in front of everyone, especially when she had agreed to hold the wedding that way. But she said that no matter how it's held, touching someone's feet like she's a slave is not what she would do in a million years. I held down my temper as I did not want to fight, but she accused me of \"Living in the 21st century when you clearly belong to the medieval era.\"\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most women change last names after their marriage or have kids inherit their dad's last names. Are such women oppressed? Is the practice misogynistic if it is happening with consent? I am not going to change my name when i get married, but if someone chooses to, it is their choice. Muslim women wear hijabs but men don't. Are they oppressed? Is that misogynistic? Don't try to fit your lense on other people.\n\nOP did wrong by not discussing details of the wedding and deciding what they wanted to keep.", ">It went smoothly towards the end when **both of us** were supposed to touch the feet of the groom's parents.\n\nOP is TA without changing the narrative so let's not.", "Except he said that BOTH of them were going to touch his parents feet.", ">I was supposed to touch the feet of the bride's in-laws as well. It would have been the groom's first, but it would have included hers afterwards. It was not one-sided.\n\nNot true", "Nah that shit is weird as fuck, making people bow and scrape at your feet like some sort of beggar or something.

I think a lot of traditions (especially non-Euro ones) can get a bad rap based on snap judgments without the full context.  I just wanted to add to what you'd shared.\n\nThanks, we've been together 8 years and still very happy with each other.  Some friction with the two cultures but it's been pretty minimal. I will say I do have trouble with some other aspects of how his family does things, which are patriarchal but even more so just authoritarian (neither of which I can get behind).  But it's more extended family than nuclear, and we live on our own so it doesn't affect our day-to-day lives much.  The touching feet thing doesn't feel especially gendered since it's both of us doing it, and as long as that's the case I'm very happy to do things that make people feel respected (especially older people, since my native culture is awfully ageist).\n\nAnyway thanks, and best wishes to you too!", "Kissing the ring is another example of disgusting, and the hijab is different entirely because that doesn\u2019t require you to touch people. You don\u2019t know where that ring has been, and you gotta put your lips on it because some asshole started a \u201ctradition\u201d hundreds of years ago? That\u2019s gross. We know too much about germs today to keep doing that shit.", "Because of their perspective. A Hindu would probably think having a wafer shoved in their mouth by a priest was 'gross' if they didn't know what Communion was.", "I just read his comment. He also mentioned that his inlaws knew about it and they're the one who didn't inform their daughter so it's their fault. However I still believe that she should've touched their feet on the wedding day. Whatever the issue was, they could've solved it at their home. \nAnd I'm sorry to say this but I seriously can't believe that she had never seen anyone touch another person's feet whenever she was at her boyfriend's house because it's a very common thing in Indian culture. Unless she got married without meeting them.", "It reads like.... both he and his parents lied to the bride and her family to make her do it, knowing she would say no.", "And like even if it is their job to explain wouldn\u2019t you want to make sure", "I'm sus about that too but...she chose to marry an Indian guy without doing any research about their culture. You can even see this custom in Bollywood movies. I don't understand how one can marry someone of a different background and not research. I'm not letting OP off the hook here but come on. Maybe because I love learning about other cultures that I see this differently. I don't know.", "Or she can do the research on her own before agreeing to something? It\u2019s 2023 and we all have super computers in our pockets. LMAO adults taking responsibility? Psshhh lame amirite?", "No not at all. I'm glad Indians fight against outdated customs. My deal was, I'm baffled she didn't know this at all. If she's spent time with him and her family, I'm sure whenever he met some elders and such, he probably did this. I have friends who do this, I've seen it. I find it weird she never picked up on it and didn't do her own research. One thing I generally have issue with, something I had to face for being different, is people expecting others to be some sort of ambassador of culture. Like, I get exhausted having to explain things all the time and wish people took initiative to just research on their own. I can't imagine what it must feel like in your case. I'm sure people keep asking you about the dot on your forehead and if you speak Indian. Lilly Singh does some hilarious videos about this.", "Really? This is news to me. Maybe it's the Indians I know, but they do this just for meeting elders, I've seen it.", "Ok, at least with shoes on. I thought you have to touch stranger bare feets. gross.", "Question becomes did they skip touching her parents\u2019 feet bc they\u2019re misogynists or bc they\u2019re excluding them from a tradition for not being part of the religion/culture/ethnicity/whatever it stems from? Both are pretty shitty IMO.\n\nOr potentially they were *going* to touch her parents\u2019 too and didn\u2019t get that far\u2026 which introduces the idea that they were going to just tell her parents day-of to strip their socks and shoes. Jesus. Every way I think about this, OP is awful!", "His edit says \u201cI was supposed to touch the feet of the *bride\u2019s* in-laws. So\u2026. Still his own parents.

We discussed what we were doing. \n\nHad I stopped during the wedding, left the stage to get a heavy cape, my spouse would've confused. If I gave her a cloak to put on me, how would she know what I wanted her to do, other than mind reading?\n\nThe OP's wife has to touch feet? Is it a tap? Is a rub? Is there a minimum time? Do they touch the OP's Mother's feet, Father's feet, first? Touch them both at the same time?\n\nI had agreed to anything my spouse wanted. She still has to tell me what it is I'm doing.", "Thanks for the warning!", ">I don't think it is societies have to be evaluated in context of their time. \n\nGreat. We are talking about what is happening **now.** \n\n>Ironically, the bride's parents are the most respected in the entire ceremony. It is said that givng your daughter's hand in marriage is the biggest sacrifice parents can do as a human.\n\nNotice the thing I replied to you saying was all in the present tense?\n\nYes the practice is still misogynistic if it is happening with consent. Internalised misogyny is still misogyny. And the reasoning behind doing things absolutely matters", "Good for you that you don't have to practise it, then. Thank God you were born into the right culture for you.", "Are you perhaps from the same culture? If not you don't have a say about our tradition.", "Aah I see, your opinions come from a place of racism.

Well done!", "So if personal contact is the root of your issue, is hugging people as a greeting, playing sports like american football, wrestling, sitting on the floor, wearing shoes inside the house also absolutely gross and disgusting to you? idk, maybe you are the problem then. let people live their lives lol. No is kissing anyone's feet bro. chill out lol. No one is forcing you to do it.", "But they claim it to be \n1.Misogynist, when both bride and groom do it, which was written in the post \n2. Just gross and weird\nFirst one is already not true, all they have to do is read the damn post.\nSecond one, they just dismiss the tradition and insult it in the same breath. Even if I wasn't raised Catholic, I wouldn't treat someone else's customs so lightly if it was clearly harmless(in regards to your scenario).", "No, he said he talked to her parents and apparently they laughed at the idea of them touching their feet but agreed to it and said they'll explain to her. He mentioned in a comment I think. He did this for her parents' feet too.", "Personally, I would hope my significant other would take the time and help me understand their culture, rather than just expecting me to go online and research. I mean, the internet is full of misinformation, just because it happens in movies doesn\u2019t mean it is automatically a cultural thing everyone should know and accept as fact. \n\nOP dropped the ball hard and doesn\u2019t seem to be investing any time or effort into his spouse. He literally couldn\u2019t be bothered to tell her. If it wasn\u2019t worth talking about, then it\u2019s obviously not that important. If it was that important, he\u2019s setting her up for failure via lack of communication. Any angle you look, op is def TA.", "They're in the UK and he could have come across as super progressive in the relationship ...... then unleashed the traditional/conservative values once he locked her down.\n\nThis is probably the first sign which caught her off guard. Her reaction sounds like she knows her value as a woman in the modern world", "Tbh It very much depends on what part of India and what religious practices your family practices. It can be very different from one family to the next. Bollywood is the worst at showing this.", "With Indian Hindu culture there are lots of movies, youtubes, etc you can watch to get an idea. She definitely should have been doing some form of research. However, you would also rely on your spouse to tell you major things. \n\nMy ex was a different culture but also Muslim. There were no reliable sources for me outside of him to learn about their wedding rituals. I asked him for MONTHS with multiple hours long conversations about I want to make sure that his family doesn\u2019t think we as a couple are excluding them since we were handling most of the planning ourselves. We eveb had a google doc with all the traditions from both sides and we were figuring out which ones we wanted to incorporate. Literally the morning of the wedding his family asks which bridal suite is theirs for a ceremony for them where the women put on these turbans. Never heard this request the entire time. His mom got upset because it\u2019s a big part of their culture. Luckily it was a holiday and we were the only wedding at the venue and their were spate suites. All because he didn\u2019t know how to simply communicate with his family or me. One of many reasons he is an ex!\n\nWhile the \u201coutsider\u201d should do any due diligence, the person in the culture absolutely has the responsibility to inform the other about their traditions.", "We used to have an office in India that we outsourced admin stuff to. So they constantly kept us informed of when they would be closed for public holidays.  And literally every time, whenever the email would come through, people would turn me to explain.  At some point they even just stopped asking - they just expected me to announce what the holiday was. Once, we got an email in early April.  Everybody turned to look at me, and I got so much pleasure out of looking at them deadpan and announcing that they were closed for Good Friday and Easter. \n\nBut seriously - me being a cultural ambassador for random people is not the same as OP explaining things to his future wife. About things that were going to happen in THEIR wedding. And it still stands that maybe she just didn\u2019t know this was a formal (and seemingly vital) ritual in the wedding, as well as just did not want to.", "They were supposed to touch grooms parents and then her parents but she refused so they skipped both parents completely. Or that\u2019s the way I took it.", "And now OP is sending in the Excuse Brigade, lmao!\n\n\"I am not the one assigned to even explain it to her!\"\n\n\"Apparently her parents did not inform her.\"\n\n\"I did not inform her myself because there were many other customs involved aside from this which I did not know.\"\n\nBlah, blah, blah, OP. You blindsided your bride and are now surprised she didn't want to pay obeisance to your parents in a custom no one explained to her.\n\nYou've only got yourself to blame here...but you won't take the responsibility which reinforces that YTA.", "I like your argument. Its logical.\n\nHowever, most practices stem from old traditions, especially marriages. Even if you look at society today, marriage still largely across the world, is seen as women leaving their house to start a new household. Example: walking the bride down the aisle, asking for hand in marriage etc. This respect to the daughter's parents is equivalent to such rituals. People need to decide for themselves what they want to keep in their ceremony. Things evolve over time as society changes. \n\nI still don't agree that touching feet in this case itself is misogynistic in any way as it is done to both sets of parents by both the bride and groom. And the logic behind that is simply respecting the people who raised you and educated you.", "Yeah, thankfully OP\u2019s ex has that right as well.

But didn't he say before that his parents talked to her parents to pass on the message? \n\n'Our parents had explained it to hers' who didn't tell his wife.\n\nNow he is saying he briefed her parents directly? Smells fishy.", "Yeah I'm pretty sus about him talking to her parents and not her. He didn't communicate with her effectively.", "Ah i see. I have a ton of complaints with your culture too. Like how normalized hook ups are. Maybe you guys need to tone down on that.", "Of course it's wrong to force someone to do that, the fuck. But normally when people partake in that tradition they aren't being forced lmao.\nI'm not talking about the post dude, just remarking on people's callous comments about the tradition in question. It's fine if someone thinks it's weird or gross, but calling it archaic or outdated seems unfair", "That's no problem mate, you can think however you want to", "Dope, I disagree with your criticism of my culture as well. Crazy how different people have different opinions on things. Notice how I didn\u2019t cry about how it wasn\u2019t your place to criticize my pwecious culture? \ud83d\udc80", "Nah. There will be practices from every culture that are gross and should be done away with.
