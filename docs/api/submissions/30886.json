My husband has 3 kids, 10M, 5F and 2F with his ex gf, I'll call her Brooke 32F. \n\nBrooke and my husband were never married and common law isn't practiced in our state. My husband is a lawyer with a Family Law firm and I'm a clerk in a different firm. He says he saw me from across the desk when he came to pick up some documents for a custody case and thought I was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. We started dating three months before his youngest daughter was born, seven months after he had broken up with his ex, she found out she was pregnant after the breakup. I met the kids officially 2 months before we got married.\n\nBrooke hates me with a burning passion. And I can empathize with her. She has custody of the kids every other weekend and I can understand that it's difficult not having custody of your kids.\n\nRecently, I have been offered another job with more flexible hours, digitally cataloging and organizing caseloads for the named partners of the firm; it comes with better benefits and a pay raise. I asked about the possibility of working from home and was told I could have my own office or work from home if I wanted to. I took the job immediately, with the stipulation I work from home because it allows me to spend more time with my stepkids when their dad is working, eliminating our need for daycare or a babysitter.\n\nThis all started because the basketball season is starting up and I'm ready to start assistant coaching my stepson's basketball team. He is rather good, and I played rep basketball for years, in addition, I have my officiant certification and my coaching license. Since my hours at work are flexible, I have also picked up an assistant coaching position with the tenth-grade girls rep basketball team. I will also be able to make more from scratch dinners for my family. \n\nMy stepson loves basketball and the girls love my baking and dinners. I'm glad all of them seem interested in me and like me. \n\nBrooke, however, is really angry with me right now. She phoned me, angry that my stepson is calling me their \"bonus mom\". I didn't know such a title existed and I feel touched. However, she is also angry I will be coaching her son's basketball team and have been helping him with homework. She says I stole her kids, I stole her man and I stole her life.\n\nI haven't told my husband about her call as he's got court tomorrow and I don't want to interrupt his sleep.

Unpopular I'm sure, but OK. Your husband, a family attorney, took full custody of his children, allow them to only see their mother every other weekend and you want to know if you are an a** for (as it sounds in your post) smugly and eagerly stepping into the role?\n\nHope you have a prenup or you may very well find yourself in the same shoes as the woman whose life your husband tried to destroy.", "I\u2019m confused as to the math. You started dating 3 months before his daughter was born, right?  But somehow 7 months after he broke up with his ex?  Pregnancies are 9 months.  So it doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Alsoooo to add. My ex husband met his wife a few months after we split and I had our new born. They are very wealthy I am a beneficiary so I can be a stay at home Mum. They do nothing but support and help and encourage and lift us ALL up. We are still a family  at the end of the day and gotta take care of each other if we are all good then the child is good. I encourage the step Mum to be bonus Mum and she is amazing but doesn\u2019t gloat about anything. All I\u2019m tryna say is you could actually do this instead of the kinda evil stuff you\u2019re up to. And ps she probably isn\u2019t working bc she was caring for a baby and now even if it\u2019s older has some real trauma by this whole situation and having her children taken away that would make any mother traumatised for life by what you\u2019re doing", "YTA. You and your husband both screwed Brooke over and you know it. Most beautiful woman he'd ever seen? Trust me, with a man like that, there will be others. At this point all you can do is plug your brain in so he doesn't screw you over in the same way he screwed his ex wife over.", "ESH - look you are awfully keen to be seen as a better or bonus mum to these kids and as you have no children of your own have no idea how this effects his ex partner. You said she quit her job the day of the break up and of course you have nothing to do with the break up however I don\u2019t actually believe you, she\u2019s living in a one bedroom apartment with no income is the reason you and he has the children but I don\u2019t believe she has done all these things because she\u2019s jealous of you two. You are so happy that she has less custody because her ex is wealthy and you sound like you might even be prepared to get rid of her forever! Because you are giddy with your fantasy life style and pay no attention to the facts.", "This post seems iffy to me. To many things don't line up for me and the tone of the post is coming across as kind of smug. I really can't help but feel like bio mom has been screwed over by your man and he's been turning the screws ever since they split. That whole split sounds hicky too. For that I would go with AH.", "Is there a reason Brooke does not have at least 50% custody time with the kids ?\n\nEDIT : I'm going with ESH, as in you and your husband.\n\nSomething bothered me in your post and your answer to question makes me even more unconfortable. Your husband used his money to take the kids away from their mother and now, you're the one who is changing her schedule to make more time for the kids. \n\nLet's be honest here, your husband screwed Brooke over and I get the feeling that they weren't broken up when he started seeing you. She has all the reasons in the world to get pissed. \n\nAnd I can be downvoted for this, I don't care. A good father would make sure that the mother of his kids could afford a place big enough to have the kids more than some week-ends, especially when he can afford a nanny and a fancy lawyer. Your husband sucks.", "Yta\n\nSo your husband used his money to confiscate his kids, and now you're blaming/ vilainizing the mother for being mad about it.\n\nShe birthed those kids, you know, CARRIED THEM AND PUSHED THEM OUT OF HER BODY, AND he stole them just cuz he's rich? Not because she's a bad mother, but used his money cuz he sees those kids as an extension of his ego?\n\nHow embarrassing that you don't realize he'll do the same to you.\n\nAlso, you're not slick. We all understand he started seeing you WHILE he was with her. That's why you emphasize your pathetic fairytale. It won't absolve you from being the sidechicks. She was pregnant while you started dating that jorobada, and you don't understand why she doesn't eff with you?", "**Oh, this is all so past icky, it's almost disgusting.**\n\nSo he's a monkey, swinging from one woman to the next. The first \"wife\" with him for over 10 years while he got his degree, and carried and birthed 3 children. Poof, there goes her career... You know that definitely happened, right?\n\nBut hang on...\n\nHe spots you in a crowded room, oh how romantic; and there he goes, swinging to the next branch with you sitting proudly on it. \n\nIn the meantime, he gets to break up with the mother of his children, \"for the most beautiful woman he's ever seen\", use the degree she supported him to get to take her children away while she lives in a place where she can't even offer her children a room to sleep in. You decided you'd be with him after he left her while she was pregnant with his 3rd child. \n\nYou're with **THE GUY WHO DID THAT**\n\nBut now look at you; coaching his son's basketball team, baking and cooking for the girls, taking up another coaching position and **also** holding down a higher position with more pay at home, loving the freedom he denied the mother of his children after she did all those years of the actual hard work. \n\nYTA and so is your husband. You're all terrible but your smugness is shocking and if you think he wouldn't ever do that to you, just remember he did it to the woman he chose to bear his children. \n\nThis whole post is gross.\n\nEdit: typo", "LMAO I don\u2019t believe a word of this and I\u2019d love to hear Brookes side of the story.\n\nYTA", "\"Common law isn't practised in our state\"- So what you're saying that had they been married she would have been entitled to some of his wealth? And after all that time off after birthing those children and losing income. So now she's in a 1 bedroom and therefore can't have custody of her kids all because she wasn't entitled to what most spouses are in most of the world, just because he wouldn't marry her - no other reason. And you're proud of this? Smug and keen to take over her parental role when they already have a mother. This is why common law is important, to protect those who try to dangle marriage as a carrot and leave you with close to nothing. YTA, your attitude sucks.", "Your husband is TA. And he'll do to you what he did to his ex one day, sorry.", "YTA and your husband is the bigger YTA \n\nReading this post makes me feel sick to my stomach. How disgusting.", "He moves on quickly doesn't he? With someone new while his ex partner is still pregnant then married quickly too \n\nInteresting he would continue to have kids with her and not get married \n\nHardly a prime catch is he? \n\nProtect yourself and don't get too invested in the kids cos he will likely be moving on soon again anyway", "YTA. You are an accessory to parental alienation. \n\nYour husband lived with someone like they were married for over a decade and had children with them! They broke up when she was pregnant, could you just imagine the amount of stress mentally and on your body that causes?   Do you realise 1 in 8 pregnancies end in miscarriage and stress can increase that? I\u2019m quite certain that the reason the mother of your step children quit her job was not solely to get your husband back. \n\nThe fact that he actively pursued custody of the kids rather than try to maintain a healthy balanced relationship with the mother is brutal af and you going along with it to play happy families is disturbing. \n\nUnless the mother has been abusive, she should be getting more time with the children, not you.", "So why does their mother only have weekend custody and not 50/50. If it is becasue if some legitimate reason then it\u2019s fine what you\u2019re doing. If your husband used his money and lawyer clout to gain custody for selfish reasons then that\u2019s a different story. If the latter is the case then of course she\u2019s going to be upset. I\u2019m not sure about this one. I\u2019m getting a vibe if smugness from you post. The whole part about him seeing you for the first time added nothing to the situation and was more like a humble brag. Need more detail. Are you stepping up because she won\u2019t, or are you essentially trying to replace her as a mother. If your husband did use his money and power to take his kids, then I would be wary as if you guys don\u2019t work out he\u2019ll use the same money and power to take everything from you.", "This whole post reads as a humble bragging to me..", "YTA for lying. You started dating him 3 months before his youngest was born and truly Believe you are not the home wreckers AP???", "Info: were you responsible for the break up?", "ESH. \n\nThe mom wants to be more involved. Instead you're stepping up because you'd rather be their mom than their mom? Kids are the priority but there's no getting around that this is a big FU to and taunt of their mom. \n\nBusy lawyers don't get nearly full custody unless the other parent has serious issues. You didn't mention any serious issues, so there's likely more big FUs sent by your household to mom.", "Why doesn\u2019t she have 50/50 care?", "You met the kids 2 months before you got married? So they had absolutely no time to get to know you or get used to your presence before you were foisted on them. Now you\u2019re pretending to be mommy? \n\nYour and your husband absolutely suck.

He practices family law, he has connections, with a firm specialising in this. Common law isn't practiced which he was fully aware of, her possibly not. \nHe took her children and married you quickly as a replacement mom.

Your dreamboat of a partner dumped his pregnant GF (I suspect that because the math in your post doesn't exactly jive, you started dating seven months after he dumped her but three months before the birth of his youngest?  Was she carrying for ten months?), screwed her out of the custody and you gladly accepted it. Now you are trying to play mom to her kids?\n\nGood Lord.\n\nESH.", "I guess your husband knew what he was doing by marrying you. He got a live in housekeeper/nanny/coach for his children. I wouldn\u2019t be boasting about yourself too much.", "NAH. But while you are busy raising his three kids, with home cooked meals, while you also work from home so no need to pay for childcare!, he is doing what? Why isn\u2019t he double booking work from home and parenting his three kids? And why would a dad prefer that his kids be raised by someone who is not their mother? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re great but you are not their mom. They have a mom who is precluded from raising them because she has less money.  You feel special and not like an unpaid nanny bc he married you and not the mother of his kids.

You went too far when you fell for your trash husband. YTA. I\u2019m excited to see the post about when he does it to you next.", "YTA \n\neven if you didn\u2019t steal her life there is the fact you stole her only reasons for existing which was the kids.

In the same way your husband used not being married and his law knowledge to price his ex out of 50% custody for his kids, don\u2019t think he won\u2019t do the same and use you not being biologically related to take your \u2018bonus kids\u2019 away from you when he sees the next \u2018most beautiful woman in the room\u2019 (yuk).\n\nAll of the stuff you\u2019re doing would be really nice, I\u2019m incredibly in favour of step parents becoming bonus parents when it\u2019s not at anyone else\u2019s expense. But their mum has clearly been pushed out for no actual reason that I can see. Do you really feel so insecure of your position as bonus mum now that you only think it will stand if you keep mum out?\n\nYou say she quit her job\u2026 could that have been because she was pregnant and single ffs. That was probably lose lose wasn\u2019t it. Quit work he took the kids and packed her off to a 1 bed where she can\u2019t host the kids, despite the fact it\u2019s a known thing that women are financially penalised for starting a family in a way that men aren\u2019t and part of his wealth will undoubtedly be down to sacrifices she made (if only being the woman and the one who carried and birthed babies). But had she have stayed in work\u2026. Well I bet he would have used his law knowledge to spin the story the opposite way that how could she be a good mum if she was having to work all hours. But what other choices did he leave her with if he\u2019s ended up with everything and her nothing? Because it sounds like they created a family together and then he took it - else why would there not have been a more equal division of time and money after the split.

You\u2019ve casually slipped that in there but that suggests there\u2019s even more assholery here than you\u2019ve said up front?\n\nYou seem to genuinely care about these kids so maybe ask yourself, is it in their best interests to have three parents who love them including a good relationship with their mum and the option to stay with her and remain close should they choose to, or for them to have their mum pushed out from their lives to make room for you and be in the middle of three warring parents? What happens when they realise this is what happened and don\u2019t want anything to do with you, will you feel so good about your position then?", "Keep up with the BC and your looks, OP.

He says he saw me from across the desk when he came to pick up some documents for a custody case and thought I was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. We started dating three months before his youngest daughter was born, seven months after he had broken up with his ex, she found out she was pregnant after the breakup. I met the kids officially 2 months before we got married.\n\nBrooke hates me with a burning passion. And I can empathize with her. She has custody of the kids every other weekend and I can understand that it's difficult not having custody of your kids.\n\nRecently, I have been offered another job with more flexible hours, digitally cataloging and organizing caseloads for the named partners of the firm; it comes with better benefits and a pay raise. I asked about the possibility of working from home and was told I could have my own office or work from home if I wanted to. I took the job immediately, with the stipulation I work from home because it allows me to spend more time with my stepkids when their dad is working, eliminating our need for daycare or a babysitter.\n\nThis all started because the basketball season is starting up and I'm ready to start assistant coaching my stepson's basketball team. He is rather good, and I played rep basketball for years, in addition, I have my officiant certification and my coaching license. Since my hours at work are flexible, I have also picked up an assistant coaching position with the tenth-grade girls rep basketball team. I will also be able to make more from scratch dinners for my family. \n\nMy stepson loves basketball and the girls love my baking and dinners. I'm glad all of them seem interested in me and like me. \n\nBrooke, however, is really angry with me right now. She phoned me, angry that my stepson is calling me their \"bonus mom\". I didn't know such a title existed and I feel touched. However, she is also angry I will be coaching her son's basketball team and have been helping him with homework. She says I stole her kids, I stole her man and I stole her life.\n\nI haven't told my husband about her call as he's got court tomorrow and I don't want to interrupt his sleep. So AITA for taking an active parenting role? Have I gone too far?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
