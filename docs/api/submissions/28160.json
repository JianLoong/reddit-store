They are placed there on purpose for that reason.\nLet\u2019s look at it this way. In a bathroom stall, no one should be in there for more than 15 minutes in a public bathroom, unless there is something SERIOUSLY wrong happening. Most people should be able to wait ~15 minutes. It\u2019s a high turnover rate. You can use the handicapped stall if need be, but it\u2019s not like the size of it makes your life particularly easier. Sure it can accommodate families or a wheelchair, but it doesn\u2019t have any added benefit for an able-bodied person using it. \nNow for a parking space, the turnover is much lower. People can spend hours grocery shopping or going to the mall or whatever. So you wouldn\u2019t temporarily be taking this spot up for a minute or two while the person who needs it waits. The proximity to the entryway of this spot may be desirable to you, and might make your life easier (unlike how using a handicap stall doesn\u2019t really benefit you in any way), but for others it is absolutely necessary to have that proximity, and that is why those spaces are reserved.
