Sure it can accommodate families or a wheelchair, but it doesn\u2019t have any added benefit for an able-bodied person using it. \nNow for a parking space, the turnover is much lower. People can spend hours grocery shopping or going to the mall or whatever. So you wouldn\u2019t temporarily be taking this spot up for a minute or two while the person who needs it waits. The proximity to the entryway of this spot may be desirable to you, and might make your life easier (unlike how using a handicap stall doesn\u2019t really benefit you in any way), but for others it is absolutely necessary to have that proximity, and that is why those spaces are reserved. They are desired by everyone, but necessary for a select few. Do you see the difference?", "I also need it, and I disagree with you. No one benefits from it just standing there unused.", "I read it as though they were insulting her after they could tell she had explosive shits. At that point they become the AH.", "I mean, if OP was making the sounds she describes, they absolutely knew what happened as soon as she got in the cubicle. No mind reading necessary there.", "Explosive diarrhea has a distinctive sound and probably smelled too.", "That\u2019s what I mean, no one did anything wrong but everyone else thinks they did. Idk my I\u2019m to out here lmao.", "My thought as well.  Have knowledge from an experience of walking into a shared laundry room where I almost stepped in...yikes, is that?!?  Yep.\n\nI called the office to report, they said \"thanks, we've been notified and the clean up crew is on the way.\"\n\nI felt very bad for the clean up crew.", "Lol if you even spent 2 seconds looking into my profile you would know I am in fact a woman. I know period pain, I know period poops are awful. I\u2019ve been there. Life is absolutely tough for women. But apparently only your life is tough.", "Yuck!  Have you not seen *Bridesmaids*?", "It was.", "Even without the /s you are entirely right lmao", "I was too busy looking for the \"minuscule bladder\" then those poor intestines and apologising to my body for putting it through that 3 times that I missed the baby and had to go back after you comment, and oh boy is that an umbrella, lol, thanks I needed that chuckle", "Maybe it's your region? I don't have issues generally, unless it's a mall at Christmas.", "I'm disabled. I'm not sure why you wrote this like I'm not? Your whole comment is written in a very condescending manner. Do you see that? \nI have fully experienced the waiting period of pissing myself because someone has occupied the handicap stall for lengthy times. I have waited over 20 minutes on a few occasions.\n\nOnce a girl came out and literally apologised for being too into her game.", "A lot of poop has those sounds and smells.", "I think I get what you're saying, both parties feel that the other party was the asshole but no one was actually being an asshole.", "Then you know why we can\u2019t just be bedbound for 1 week every month. So even if you have pain, life must move on.\n\nPpl still need groceries when they are on their period.\n\nIt\u2019s 99ranch so it\u2019s like saying Safeway or any other grocery store?", "Lmao no!!!\n\nJust know the song because my grandson and Danny go!!  \ud83d\ude02", "I live in a medical capital\ud83d\ude02 it is absolutely a problem here", "I\u2019m sorry I assumed your ability status, that\u2019s on me. But surely as a disabled person you understand the difference between the two? I\u2019m sorry people are jackasses. If there\u2019s a line, it\u2019s courteous to get the hell out, and obviously if someone in line needs the bigger stall and only the bigger stall then they go first", "lol, now you're just being argumentative. We can all tell when someone's ass is uncontrollably spluttering hot wet shit vs a normal bowel movement.", "It really doesn\u2019t.", "I didn't pick up that op thought the other people were AH though.", "Ah!  My comment will make much more sense if/when you watch it.", "Then it's likely you have a high rate of issues with disabled people needing the stall when it's occupied, as well.", "It's just *another* one of those things that disabled people have to deal with, though, ya know? Every day is fucking hard enough as it is. I am constantly ran into, looked over, told to hurry, dealing with places that only have bathrooms down a flight of stairs. \n\nIt's exhausting. When you have to go (especially with IBS-D! \ud83d\udc4b), it's SO frustrating to be told, \"lol oops, I got caught up, sorry!!!! I just like the extra room!!!\"). It happens a lot. I'd say once a month?", "Honestly not. I've had times it came out like that but it wasn't an emergency. Gas, wetness level,  could be a lot of things.\n\nConsidering that, I think it is a bit to far to call the people just standing there assholes. They can't read her mind or butt.", "Haha \ud83d\ude02. Now I think I don\u2019t want to watch it \ud83e\udd23", ">They can't read her mind or butt \n\nWorst superpower combo ever", "I thought it was normal to shit like that for a long time too but it turns out I have IBS and a bunch of food sensitivities. If this is a regular occurrence for you too, it's probably worth seeing a doctor. Not saying this to argue, just because it changed my life to understand what was going on with my sensitive digestive system.", "Oh, that scene is just a small part of it.  However, it\u2019s NOT child-friendly.", "Or best?", "My bottom is good, but appreciate the heads up."]}
