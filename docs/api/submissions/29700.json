My mom (43f) came into my room the other day asking me if I want to go and stay somewhere on that Saturday night so she can have her man over to do the deed. I was obviously upset by this and told her I planned on coming home as I wanted to sleep in my own bed. She then persisted that I go and stay with a friend because she didn\u2019t want to have to go out to do whatever (my twin siblings would also be out the house they are 5 and staying with my grandparents). I said it is not my problem that she wants someone to stay over and I will be coming home to sleep. She then told me that she would be loud and make sure to wake me up to hear and made it clear she did not want me home. This could have been a joke but either way that is not normal to say that to your child right? For context I have been hearing my mom have sex with her boyfriends at the time since I was around 10 years old and I had complained multiple times at hearing this. I obviously don\u2019t want to come home and hear my mom having sex but I also want to sleep at home as it is my bed and I too live there. We\u2019ve been going back and forth on this and now I\u2019m going to stay somewhere else but I still feel like she is in the wrong for asking me to leave in the first place. Idk what to think I understand where she is coming from but still?\n\nEdit:\nI feel like I need to clear some things up. First of all no I do not pay rent because simply I cannot afford to. I live in the UK so there is no underage drinking. I cannot simply just move out that is easier said then done and when I got to uni next year I do plan on leaving and my mom also agrees that then will be the best time for me to move. I am still in full time education and have a part time job so let\u2019s not be so harsh on the fact that I still live with my mom. I understand the privilege of living at home rent free but it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that my own mom wants to get me out the house so she can have sex with someone. Some of you asked about the boyfriend and yes he does have his own home it\u2019s just in another city and I\u2019ve personally never met him.

Your mom sounds weird and inconsiderate, it's your fucking birthday.  Also for everyone saying she's 19, grow up, get your own place... you don't just magically retire from being a parent the day your kid turns 18. You're a parent until the day you die and parents are supposed to put their kids first and your mom isn't doing that. On your birthday.", "\nETA: I am referring to the fact that OP (and myself) were intentionally exposed to reoccurring sexual explicit content/sounds as minors. I thought that was pretty clear in my response. First sentence being my childhood was like this too. You can stop telling me I\u2019m crazy for crying over the very last incident of abuse when I turned 18. That was ONE incident of many since I was 6/7 years of age. \n\nNTA- this was my childhood too. I came home on my 18th birthday to hearing my mother having sex with her husband. I turned around and sat in our backyard crying for hours because of how I couldn\u2019t even feel comfortable in my own home and on my birthday nonetheless. It was like 6pm in the afternoon and they were in the living room. It\u2019s insane to me to make your children feel uncomfortable in their own home. After that I planned my escape. I moved 900+ miles away a decade ago and I\u2019ve never returned nor will I return to their home. \n\nAlso, important to note that as a child you did not have the ability to consent nor the option to remove yourself from the situation. I brought this up to my therapist before and she felt strongly that this was very much abusive and emotionally neglectful to put a child in a situation like this. She was appalled. And so am I that people are saying you\u2019re TAH for being upset about this considering your whole childhood you were forced to hear sexual acts against your will. And honestly I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re paying rent or not. Being a parent doesn\u2019t end when your kids turn 18. You still have a moral responsibility to protect for children emotionally, physically, and mentally to the best of your ability.", "NTA and the number of peoples saying you're an asshole and you should just leave the house or something prove how detached of reality those peoples are, you literally hear your mom having sex since you're 10 and she literally threatens you with being loud during the deed, especially when you complained about it, a kid shouldn't have to hear their parents have sex, especially when it's multiple strangers, it can be traumatizing, she can still have sex with whoever she wants, the kids just don't need to hear it ffs.\n\nAnd yeah I know, the \"Kids should be out of the house at 18yo\" are gonna come and be like \"Well it's not her house !!!\" yes, yes it is, she literally have the same rights as her mom even if she doesn't pay, which like, she literally got out of highschool at 18, or maybe later not even yet if she's got held back for a year or more, but I guess the parents ready to throw out their kids immediately when they turn 18 can't think of that or other scenarios where life isn't all rose tinted and easy", "NTA I would be traumatized if one of my parents said this to me. Some things need to be kept private for one. I would have asked if the guy has his own place? If he doesn't I'd question that too.

We have sex regularly, while our teenage and preteen kids are in the house.  We shut our door, and it's usually done at night when we have our loud fan on so no one can hear what's going on.  There are ways to get some with kids in the house that don't disturb anyone.\n\nTelling your kid to leave so you can get laid is pretty crappy.  Especially on their birthday.\n\nOP, be sure to put on your noise cancelling headphones that night.  Or, if you're feeling extra petty, make a sign of encouragement to place outside their door for when they're done.

Ew. Your mom is an asshole. Having loud sex where your kids can hear is fucked up. \n\n\nIt sounds like she's determined to have loud sex that night though, with or without you there.

Bang on the walls. Set the smoke alarms off. You\u2019re not college roomies, this is her child, adult or not.

As long as you're not in the room and watching, there's no crime.  Sex with your adult partner in the privacy of a closed room is not a crime. I heard my mom and stepdad have sex as a kid, in the middle of the night.  Was it uncomfortable? Yes, but I should have been asleep and more importantly it wasn't my business.  \n\nPart of being an adult, and having adult roommates is the art of developing diplomacy skills.  You need to start respecting that she is more than just your mother, she's an adult with the right to engage in intimacy with a consenting partner, privately in her own home.  A closed door is sufficient, and she tried to make arrangements that would have benefitted all.  You're only thinking about your own needs, despite the fact that she provides a roof over your head when she doesn't have to - you are an adult after all and she could certainly send you out to negotiate adulthood on your own.  This should be an important growing-up lesson for you. \n\nI recently dealt with this situation trying to resolve a conflict between my sister and her 17 yo daughter, who lashed out at her mother for having sex with her husband at 3 am.  Turns out my niece had been staying up way too late, but either way my sister and brother-in-law's sex life is not her business.  My niece has always been a good kid, but was using this as an excuse to pick fights after a heartbreak of her own and wanting more freedom (specifically the right to come and go all week without accountability, including during school hours, she's been mismanaging a bit of burnout with school).  \n\nUltimately, you are now an adult, even if you are still reliant on your mother for shelter.  Part of a reasonable trade for your freedom to do as you please should come with a willingness to compromise.  Your mother asked you for a few hours privacy and it doesn't sound unreasonable to me.  She doesn't owe you the comfort of pretending she doesn't have a sex life, of which she's entitled to.  The proper solution is that she simply enjoys her intimacy privately regardless of whether or not you're there, if the place is hers and she contributes to the majority of your needs as an adult, that or send you on your way *as an adult*.  You're roommates and you should start learning how to compromise instead of pretending only you should get your way. \n\nYou have no business interfering with her right to intimacy.

That seems reasonable and respectful - especially considering how you have expressed your dislike of her having intimate relationships while you are home in the past. Mom shouldn\u2019t have gone overboard with her threat about being loud, but it was probably out of frustration that she\u2019s trying to accommodate your wishes and you are being petulant.

My mom (43f) came into my room the other day asking me if I want to go and stay somewhere on that Saturday night so she can have her man over to do the deed. I was obviously upset by this and told her I planned on coming home as I wanted to sleep in my own bed. She then persisted that I go and stay with a friend because she didn\u2019t want to have to go out to do whatever (my twin siblings would also be out the house they are 5 and staying with my grandparents). I said it is not my problem that she wants someone to stay over and I will be coming home to sleep. She then told me that she would be loud and make sure to wake me up to hear and made it clear she did not want me home. This could have been a joke but either way that is not normal to say that to your child right? For context I have been hearing my mom have sex with her boyfriends at the time since I was around 10 years old and I had complained multiple times at hearing this. I obviously don\u2019t want to come home and hear my mom having sex but I also want to sleep at home as it is my bed and I too live there. We\u2019ve been going back and forth on this and now I\u2019m going to stay somewhere else but I still feel like she is in the wrong for asking me to leave in the first place.

I\u2019ve been a single parent since my son was a newborn and I don\u2019t even date, much less have sex in the house. I haven\u2019t had sex in almost 4 years, when I got pregnant with him. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with having an active dating and sex life as a single parent, depending on how you go about it, but it needs to be totally separate from your children unless it\u2019s a serious partner you expect to share a life with, and even in that case, it should be done respectfully.\n\nThis woman is having sex with a loser who can\u2019t even provide another venue for them to have sex, so she clearly hasn\u2019t learned her lesson (I\u2019m not blaming women for being single mothers at all, but most of the time, if you become one, there is some lesson you can take away about men and your own patterns/ability to detect red flags, so that if you do date again, you can choose better going forward, and sleeping with deadbeats who can\u2019t provide a comfortable place for you and who don\u2019t care if your daughter hears the sex is not exactly displaying any growth or insight), she\u2019s insisting on having sex after her daughter has expressly said she\u2019s uncomfortable with it, shes placing her own need for pleasure over her daughter\u2019s birthday, she\u2019s involving her daughter in her sex life (my married parents did this to a degree and it was horrendous), she\u2019s bringing guys around her daughter that are not a serious boyfriend (I firmly believe you have no business introducing your kids to random flings unless your kids are totally grown-up, and even then it\u2019s sort of gross), and she\u2019s also being a shitty, inconsiderate person in general. If this wasn\u2019t her daughter, just a random roommate, it would still be gross.

You can't make people care about you even if they're supposed to. If she'd rather loudly bang her boyfriend then spend time with you on your birthday then unfortunately that is your reality. Based on apparently you being forced to listen to her having sex since you were 10 it sounds like she's been sucky for a while.
