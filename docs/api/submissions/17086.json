I (M28) had my  sister \"Martha\" (F26) and her toddler \"Melanie\" (F3) over to my house. I really like candy. Like I have an entire room dedicated to keeping the candy.\n\nUsually the door is locked, but when I went to the restroom, my sister grabbed the key that I left on the counter and went in. Martha gave her daughter some of my rare collectible skittles, and Melaniestarted eating them. I yelled at Melanie to \"f\\*\\*k off\" and took the candy from Melanie. I kicked my sister out and Melanie was crying.\n\nI may be TA because I overreacted and made Melanie cry. I also didn't inform my sister about the skittles, as I wouldn't be so mad if it wasn't the collectible ones. My parents are on my sisters side, but I think she crossed a boundary. So, reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: The skittles are old skittles from the 80s that I found at a garage sale. It was my favorite item out of all my collectible candy, looked kinda like, [https://imgur.com/a/Ants8hb](https://imgur.com/a/Ants8hb).

Except the baby.\n\nYour sister was out of bounds for bringing her in the room. Granted.\n\nYour reaction was misplaced. You screamed at a toddler? Let\u2019s just skip the whole\u2026 her mom invited her in, this wasn\u2019t her volition\u2026. This is a baby, for crying out loud, you think she has the capacity to even understand what a collectible bag if candy even is?", "You both suck, why did she go into a room that requires a key behind your back, and why did you treat a 3 year old like that for something her mother did?", "ESH besides Melanie. The one you should\u2019ve been telling to fuck off was your sister not a child who is eating something she was given.. Seriously? Over some fucking \u201crare\u201d skittles", "ESH except for your poor niece. \n\nYour sister fucked up by unlocking your candy room and giving the skittles to Melanie. She shouldn't have done that and I get why you're upset with her about it. \n\nBut dude... your response was really unhinged and unnecessary? Like... don't scream at a 3 year old and tell them to fuck off? She had *no* idea she was doing anything wrong, she was just sitting there innocently eating a treat she'd been given by a trusted adult and suddenly you're yelling in her face and cursing at her? I'm honestly amazed you need someone to tell you this. Huge AH energy there.", "I'm just stuck on the special room just for candy. LOL. But in all fairness you did lock it so your sister DID KNOW better. And she waited until you left the room. So definitely intentional. But yeah, yelling at a 3 year old  dips into YTA territory. I would have simply told her she owes you the value of the collectible Skittles or she needs to replace them. So ESH.", "ESH except the 3-year-old. Yes, it was very wrong of your sister to let your niece into your candy room. It was also very wrong of you to curse at a *toddler.* The toddler did nothing wrong. Both of you need to do better.", "I'm gonna go with a resounding ESH except that poor baby. Your sister shouldn't have invaded your privacy or given your candy to your niece, but it's hardly your niece's fault. It's never okay to tell a three-year-old to fuck off.", "You and your sister are the assholes. You for screaming at a kid, her for sneaking your candy. \n\nWho has a candy room?", "ESH - Except for Melanie, obviously. It was wrong of your sister to steal your key and give candy to her daughter. It was wrong of you to curse at Melanie as if this were somehow her fault, and (I\u2019m assuming from your word choice) physically taking the candy from her hands.\n\nMelanie had no idea what was happening. Her kid brain thought, \u201cOoh, candy! Yummy!\u201d one second, then *utter terror* at this grown-a** man screaming at her for *no discernible reason.* You know what kids do when things like this happen? They unanimously blame *themselves* rather than the adults, and you swearing at her reinforced that this was her fault, when it wasn\u2019t. It was your sister\u2019s.\n\nYour sister apparently can\u2019t be trusted in your house unsupervised, and you apparently can\u2019t be trusted around kids.", "ESH sister had no right to help herself but you screamed at a child\nEdit: except the 3 yr old, she doesn\u2019t suck and I hope she\u2019s not traumatized", "ESH except the 3 year old. But your sister especially.", "ESH\n\nThe candy was given to your niece by her mom- she had no idea it was wrong to take it, especially since she trusts that her mom won\u2019t give her bad stuff (possibly not anymore though). Yelling at your sister was justified as she was a massive AH here but yelling at your niece was not. Definitely keep the key on your person at all times going forward when your sister is around though honestly, you are well-within your rights to never have them over again.\n\nYour sister was absolutely in the wrong here.", "ESH.

Your anger should have been directed at her.", "YTA for screaming f off at a 3 year old and upsetting her terribly.    There is no need to ever curse at a small child.\n\nYour sister is an AH too for going into your candy room.  But come on,  you are 28.   Your niece is more important than skittles.   Those quick acts of cruelty can imprint on someone for a long time.   - And you were cruel to a small child.\n\nUltimately ESH except for the toddler.", "You yelled \"F\\*\\*k off\" at a 3 year old who was only eating candy that her mother had given to her?  \n\n\nYes, YTA.   \n\n\nKinda E S H but you more. Your sister should not have just helped herself to your candy but damn.", "ESH Your sister should not have given your possessions to someone else without your permission but it was messed up as hell for you to curse at a 3 year old who doesn't know better. She wasn't the one who took the candy without permission. All she knew was that her mom gave it to her.", "YTA- not the toddlers fault. Extremely inappropriate reaction.", "YTA. For yelling f**k off at a three year old. Your sister was in the wrong. Get pissed at her, sure. Screaming at a small child who could not have known they were doing something wrong, absolutely makes you an asshole.", "I never heard of something like collectible candy but even if this is a thing and your niece was eating stuff she was not supposed to touch you should not have yelled at her. She didn't have any idea that she was doing something wrong. Yes, you could have taken the bag from her and said \"Sorry love, this is some special candy your uncle wants to keep, I'll give you something else instead\" and then have a private conversation with your sister. But cursing at your little innocent niece?!? YTA.", "You screamed at a THREE YEAR OLD to FUCK OFF and you have to ask if YTA?? Seriously? Let me help you out genius: yes, YTA.", "NTA. A guest took a key and opened a locked room?  WTF?  Never let them back in.", "ESH. What's wrong with all of you? Your sister is beyond ridiculous for going into your room without your permission to give your candy to her daughter and your reaction to a 3 year old child eating your skittles is monumentally messed up. I don't care how rare it is. You don't curse and yell at a 3 year old kid. Both of you are the AH. Poor Melanie. Both her mother and uncle are acting worse than a 3 year old.", "ESH. Your sister took a key and opened a locked door. She knew she was doing wrong. However you shouldn't have yelled at an innocent 3yr old who had no idea what her mother was doing was wrong. By all means, rip your sister a new one.", "ESH. Except Melanie, she\u2019s innocent in this situation. \n\nYou\u2019re an AH for cursing at a 3 year old and making her cry. Melanie didn\u2019t know any better and it\u2019s not her fault. Martha is also an AH for taking the key and entering the room without your permission or knowledge. I think you need to apologize to your niece with some Skittles.", "Esh you're a 28 year old man why would you scream at a baby who's mother brought her to the room!? You're anger was completely misplaced and you owe her a huge apology. As for your sister she was in the wrong to do this and should have been the one you calmly explained this to.", "What in the holy fuck are collectible skittles??\n\n\nJesus.\n\nESH", "NT A\n\nYou don't go to someone's house, relative or not, and take a key to open a locked door.

Not cool dude.\n\nESH, except the kid; she was just being a kid.", "NTA for bein* mad at your sister, but yelling at the baby was wrong. The kid didn\u2019t know any better, but your sister is an asshole, who violated your boundaries.", "Didn\u2019t we just have this post with a craft room and expensive markers?", "ESH except the baby. What grown man screams and curses at a baby over candy? Fucking disgusting.", "ESH.  Your sister was wrong to unlock a door in your home and give her daughter something that wasn't hers, but you were wrong for screaming at a toddler.  You probably terrified that poor child, and she's the only one who was actually acting her age in this whole scenario!", "ESH except the kid. Sister had to unlock the door meaning she knew you didn't want people in the room then she stole from you, but.you shouldn't have cursed at a kid", "NTA Your sister crossed boundaries. She knew she was crossing boundaries because she waited until you weren't in the room to make her move. But since she had already done that by the time you got back perhaps you could have given your niece some other candy instead. From now on hide the keys to that room somewhere no one will think of looking.", "NTA. Your sister is, however.\n\nI'd react very similarly if hard to replace things I loved were being irreparably damaged, though I'd be screaming and swearing at the situation and the one who unlocked the door than at the kid.\n\nThough I would swiftly stop them from damaging my things and remove them from the room.", "NTA, mostly.  The door was locked, your sister took the key and opened it without asking. You should have lost your shit on your sister, but regardless,  nobody asked!", "Collectible candy? WTF?\n\nDo you just collect it and watch it go stale? \n\nYTA", "YTA - All that 3-year-old knows is that she was handed a bag of candy by her mom, her uncle took that candy away from her while yelling at her. Your sister was out of line. She is the one who needed to be admonished. Instead, you cursed at a baby.", "YTA. Only because I think your anger was misdirected. You should have gone off on your sister not your niece. This was all your sister's fault. In Melanie's eyes she was given permission by her mom, and doesn't understand what she did wrong to upset you.", "I mean yelling at a 3 yo to eff off is a little extreme but I think it was just first instinct. But NTA overall, your sister is TA. Massively. She knew what she was doing and gave the candy to her kid.", "YTA, why would you yell at a *toddler* who obviously didn\u2019t let herself into the room. You can be mad at your sister all you want, but you owe your niece an apology for that reaction.", "Yta.  Telling a 3 year old to f off is completely uncalled for. Giving your sister a telling off would be appropriate but leave the kid alone.", "NTA. Your sister should have never let the child into your private space.", "Your sister was absolutely wrong about what she did, but you entered a whole new universe of assholery when *you yelled at a three year old child to fuck off*.  Learn some self control.  Hard YTA", "Sure, she crossed a boundary by entering your locked room. But YTA for yelling at a toddler and telling her to f**k off. None of what happened was her fault. I kinda feel like even though what your sister did was wrong (and makes her an ah too)  it's just not as bad as how you abused your niece, which is just disturbing tbh.", "Tell me you're American without saying it\n\n>I really like candy. Like I have an entire room dedicated to keeping the candy. \n\n>rare collectible skittles\n\nThis whole story would be more acceptable if it was a locked sex dungeon.\n\nSeriously though, you made a 3 year old cry by yelling at her over something she had no control of. Well done hulk uncle.", "YTA because you told a 3 year old to fuck off when you should've said that to your sister. Your sister understands manners and how to ask a question, a 3 year old can't and they were being given to them.", "Locked door means your sister should not have went into the room let alone help herself to your stuff, HOWEVER that little girl is 3 years old and you should not have gotten as upset at a toddler for something that was out of their control. Furthermore it sounds like you have troubles with your temper because an inconvenience like this should not have garnered this type of response. Talk with people like they\u2019re humans and express your emotion tell your sister she was wrong but don\u2019t yell at your niece. Soft YTA to you hard YTA to your sister. Overall I think you need to apologize to your niece especially three year olds should not be yelled at by anyone other than their parents and even then it\u2019s usually not okay.", "YTA.  1) \u201cMelanie\u201d isn\u2019t the one that took them so yelling at a 3 yr old is completely out of line and immature 2) if it\u2019s a collectible it shouldn\u2019t be with all the other candy.  As a collector the most valuable are separated in a glass case, I don\u2019t collect candy just a collector in general.\n\nYour sister shouldn\u2019t have gone into the candy stash without permission however you completely targeted the wrong person with your anger.\n\nAlso, collectible skittles?  I\u2019m intrigued.  What makes them collectible?", "NTA \n\nGranted, you could\u2019ve been nicer to your niece in the moment. She doesn\u2019t understand. *BUT*You\u2019re only human, and it\u2019s hard not to have a strong, sudden reaction to this type of situation. You had the door locked, you had no reason to think they\u2019d even be in there. Let alone for your sister to be giving your niece things. \n\nHave a conversation with your sister about respect and boundaries. She used a key to get into the room, what further indication does she need NOT to go in that room? I think it\u2019s worth apologizing to your niece as well. They\u2019re little, but they appreciate those things", "You're almost 30, you should be able to control your anger enough not to traumatize a toddler. That's like, basic stuff, man. YTA. Your sister is an AH, too, for sneaking into a freaking locked room. You should have yelled at *her*, not the child. Get anger management sessions and don't invite them over anymore.", "You and your sister both in the wrong..she shouldn't use the key to give her kid candy without asking.. you shouldn't have yelled at the 3 year old or swear at her...yta", "YTA! You swore and yelled at a kid over a fucking candy??\n\nHow old are you again?\n\nYour sister was wrong to open that room and give candy to her daughter, but nothing NOTHING is kids fault!!\n\nAnd you are AH, like a massive and immature AH.\n\nEdit: to all the NTAs. His question was if he's the AH for yelling at 3 years old kid. Yes, he is. So is his sister.", "Nta. Some people don\u2019t have boundaries even tho it\u2019s not the kids fault the sister knew the room was off limits.
