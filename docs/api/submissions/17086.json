I (M28) had my  sister \"Martha\" (F26) and her toddler \"Melanie\" (F3) over to my house. I really like candy. Like I have an entire room dedicated to keeping the candy.\n\nUsually the door is locked, but when I went to the restroom, my sister grabbed the key that I left on the counter and went in. Martha gave her daughter some of my rare collectible skittles, and Melaniestarted eating them. I yelled at Melanie to \"f\\*\\*k off\" and took the candy from Melanie. I kicked my sister out and Melanie was crying.\n\nI may be TA because I overreacted and made Melanie cry. I also didn't inform my sister about the skittles, as I wouldn't be so mad if it wasn't the collectible ones. My parents are on my sisters side, but I think she crossed a boundary. So, reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: The skittles are old skittles from the 80s that I found at a garage sale. It was my favorite item out of all my collectible candy, looked kinda like, [https://imgur.com/a/Ants8hb](https://imgur.com/a/Ants8hb). I have lots of other collectible candy, like rare limited releases. Its not about the money, I can't find a replacement anywhere. I will also be apologizing to Melanie\n\nEdit 2: Since many of you are concerned about Melanie's health after eating the 45ish year old skittles, she seems to be okay (my sister finally texted me back, and the incident was yesterday). Also, my sister did not know about the age of the candy, it was just the first bag of candy that she saw, according to her. She is not very observant, and likely didn't notice the packaging.", "created_utc": 1683931297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fzh5l/aita_for_making_my_niece_cry/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
