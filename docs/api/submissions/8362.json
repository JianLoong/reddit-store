For context, I work at an Animal Rescue. We\u2019ve had this cat for awhile that I\u2019ve been really interested in. She\u2019s extremely sweet and I think she would fit well with my cats already at home. The only reason I haven\u2019t taken her home yet is because I\u2019ve been trying to get my partner who lives with me on board with another one.\n\nThis morning, one of my coworkers approached me and asked me about the cat\u2019s name and adoption fee. I work in the office, so I know more of that info than she does. I told her and she said that she was thinking about adopting the cat. I didn\u2019t say anything because I didn\u2019t want to be rude or step on any toes. My coworker is young, still lives with her parents, and she told me she wants to adopt the cat, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to take it home until she moves out later this year (October or later). That\u2019s all year the cat would sit at the shelter instead of in a home. \n\nI\u2019ve finally gotten the go ahead from my partner that we could try another cat and I was planning to bring her home this weekend to see how it goes (I decided this before my coworker approached me).\n\nWIBTA if I told her that I\u2019d been interested in the cat for longer and that I want to take it home this weekend? The way I see it, she could wait to choose a cat until she actually has her own place and can take one home then. We get all kinds of animals here and I know that I could also wait for a different cat to come along, but I just really like this one and I\u2019m not sure if I should stand up for myself on this or choose not to make it a huge deal.\n\nUPDATE\nI ended up speaking with my coworker about it and she was completely cool with me taking the cat home since she won\u2019t have her own place for awhile. In hindsight, I realize I definitely let my anxiety of awkward social situations get the best of me here. From now on, I\u2019m going to try and stick up for myself more and communicate better with my friends and coworkers. Thank you for all your advice and input. The cat will be coming home with me tomorrow and stay for awhile as a foster to see if it works out \ud83d\ude01", "created_utc": 1674748499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lv123/wibta_if_i_told_my_coworker_i_want_the_same_cat/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The cat should be adopted by the first people that can offer him a home, not by someone that will just park him in a shelter for almost a year. A family could have walked in any time to adopt him. It just happened that YOU are the one adoption him.", ">I was planning to bring her home this weekend to see how it goes \n\nSo you're fostering or doing a trial? Tell your coworker, but also be clear that this isn't a permanent placement yet. You don't know yet whether this cat will work out with your existing pets OR if your SO will ultimately agree to another pet.\n\nNAH", "YWNBTA \n\nYou should have mentioned your interest up front but I think keeping the cat in a shelter for about 8-9 months because she wants it would be silly. I would bring it up the next time you see her about your intent.", "I'd give her the option to adopt the cat now but you are definitely not expected to. Shelter life is not good and whoever can get the pet out of it faster os the better choice\n\nNTA", "NTA, adoption isn\u2019t based on who wants the cat the most, it\u2019s basically who is first. I get that this an awkward situation but you aren\u2019t TA at all", "YWBTA if you phrase it the way you suggested.\n\n>WIBTA if I told her that I\u2019d been interested in the cat for longer \n\nYou have probably both been in love with the cat since the cat arrived. So, dont phrase it this way.\n\nHonestly, she is probably going to think you are TA no matter what. When she brought it up to you, you should have said that you also want the cat and are trying to talk your partner into it. Then the only issue would be who got the cat out of jail first. Because you said nothing it will always look like you kept silent on purpose so you could get the cat first.\n\n\nDoesn't really matter if you look like TA to her....fur baby needs to be sprung from the joint!", "YWNBTA.\n\nThis is a first come first serve kind of situation", "NTA- people can just call dibs on living things. Whoever fills out the official papers first should get the cat", "NTA. I don't know how things are done at your shelter, but is adopting a cat yet letting it sit there for any length of time, especially close to a year, even an option? The cat doesn't need to be left in a shelter longer than is necessary. If she cares about the cat, she should be happy it has a home. Bring that baby home!", "NTA.\n\nLeaving it there for a year when it could be in a home is cruel.", "If you actually included the phrase, \"I've wanted this cat longer than you,\" then you would be a wee bit of an A, but otherwise? NAH. The cat sounds like it has a wonderful personality and I'm certain that there are a few people interested in adopting it, but as you said, more will come. \n\nJust state that as much as you know she likes it, you and your partner have decided that it may fit with the others you have so you're going to foster it just to see.", "NAH\n\nBut honestly when she asked, that would have been the best time because at that time you could have said \"oh yeah great cat, I am interested in it too\" so she would know. Plus you should have told her that expecting a cat to last for 8 months while she gets it together isn't realistic. Now it's going to look like a lie with you saying \"i wanted it first\" bc you never mentioned it once she came to you. Either way, nta but be prepared for her to react badly or no longer be cool with you", "It sounds like you are considering \"foster to adopt?\"  That's a very good idea.  Give it a couple weeks.\n\nAs far as your co-worker,  no reputable shelter would adopt a cat to someone who can't take it for 9 months.  It's a terrible disservice to the animal, the shelter has to continue to pay for food and medical care, and the cat would be taking up a bed--which means some other cat could not be cared for there.\n\nWhen your co-worker is actually ready for a pet there will still be wonderful ones at the shelter for her to choose.\n\nNTA, btw.", "NTA. If you can offer the cat a home NOW, the cat deserves that.", "NTA. There are so many cats that need to be adopted. She will find the right one when she moves out. Letting the cat sit there for another year is unfair to them. And who knows, someone completely random could come along and adopt the cat before either of you get the chance.", "NTA.  She sees the animals in the shelter - why on earth would she want to extend the poor kitty's time there?  Not saying the conditions are bad but living in a home with regular contact and attention from people is the ideal.\n\nSomeone else mentioned being up front with her.  You should have.  At this point, I might be inclined to just tell her that there is someone who wants to foster the cat with the intent to adopt.\"  You can further explain that the people adopting are acquaintances of yours and you are delivering the cat to them this weekend - she may see you taking the cat.  Of course you would have to make sure this girl isn't someone that you'd ever invite over.  \n\nBeing upfront with her would have avoided the whole (pun intended) cat and mouse game.", "NTA - What's important is that the darling kitty get out of the shelter and into a good home as soon as possible.  This is not only important for the cat, but it frees up a space for another cat who might need shelter.  Your friend isn't ready to adopt--it's unreasonable for her to expect that poor animal to wait 9 more months in shelter.  There will be more darling kitties in desperate need of a home when she is actually able to provide one.", "NTA, but be prepared for this to severely negatively impact your relationship with your coworker. It may also cause issues where coworker creates a hostile work environment.  \n\n\nIt's wrong of your coworker to want to adopt a cat 9 months before even having a house for it (which I can't imagine would even be approved, as it's cruel to the animal and a waste of the shelter's resources), but that clearly doesn't mean your coworker sees it that way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had an agreement with a rescue that I'd take two ferrets on in six months if they couldn't find another home in the meantime. They should have been an easy pair to home but wrong colour.

He was otherwise open to another pet, just nervous about the changes it might bring.", "I wasn\u2019t meaning to discriminate against her for her age at all. I just mentioned that because the reason she can\u2019t adopt the cat today is because her parents won\u2019t allow her to and that she wouldn\u2019t be moving out until much later in the year.
