Her toys I noticed are mostly secondhand, old barbies and stuff. While I was playing with her I noticed she has a lot of g1 Monster High dolls with most of their stuff. I was shocked because 1. these are hard to find where I live and 2. they are rare because they don't make g1 dolls anymore. \n\n\nLike I said these dolls are rare and some of them are my grails (my most searched for) like Rochelle Goyle. When I went through them there are about 8 decent G1 dolls aside from messed up hair and some missing accessories. These dolls are really hard to find. I asked my brother if my neice plays with them and he said she goes through cycles. I asked if I could have them or even paid for them and he seemed almost okay with it, but his girlfriend (the neices mom) came in and said no. I said I would pay for them and explained how rare they are and how I can restore them and actually appreciate them but she still said no.\n\n\nIts really bothering me because my brother and the stepdaughter both seem not to care about the dolls much but the mom/girlfriend is the one saying no even though theyre the kids dolls. Its really bothering me becuse a kid that age cant appreciate what she has and will cause these collectors dolls to worsen in condition. I even texted my brother later and offered to buy a brand new g3 doll for her but he said no. We texted a bit and he finally told me to drop it and wont reply anymore. I tried asking our mom to talk to him but she wont get involved.\n\n\nAITA FOr trying to rescue these rare dolls worth possibly hundreds of dollars?

I asked if I could have them or even paid for them and he seemed almost okay with it, but his girlfriend (the neices mom) came in and said no. I said I would pay for them and explained how rare they are and how I can restore them and actually appreciate them but she still said no.\n\n\nIts really bothering me because my brother and the stepdaughter both seem not to care about the dolls much but the mom/girlfriend is the one saying no even though theyre the kids dolls. Its really bothering me becuse a kid that age cant appreciate what she has and will cause these collectors dolls to worsen in condition.

As adults we can collect them, and of course the value of certain dolls has increased over time with G1 being a decade old and highly sought after, but these are not collector dolls. The Skullectors and dolls sold exclusively on the Mattel creations website for 2-4 times the price of playline dolls are the collector dolls.\n\nRegardless, you are not \"rescuing\" anything. You just see dolls you want and for some reason think that means you deserve them. But no, they belong to your niece and she is not required to give or sell them to you even if they were extremely rare. It sounds like she's taking decent care of them, and they are her property. She may not obsess over them every day, but she probably gets a lot of enjoyment from them when the mood strikes for her to play with them. Just let her play with her toys and choose for herself what to do with them when she's older. Maybe she will grow out of them and sell them, or maybe she will keep them forever and become a collector herself someday, and these dolls will be an extremely special and nostalgic part of her collection. The fact that a child even owns toys from a line that was discontinued before she was born makes me think they may have been handed down to her by a family member, so there could be additional sentimental value that you aren't aware of.\n\nRegardless, stop pressuring your niece or her parents to give, sell, or trade the dolls to you. Asking once was fine, but you need to take no for an answer and drop the subject. They aren't abused animals that you need to save from suffering. They're pretty pieces of plastic that you want to put on your shelf. You just sound like you're trying to exploit your niece. If you intend to pay market value, then just buy the same dolls from someone else online. You don't need to save these specific dolls.

I was so peaceful and happy up there. So, within just 2-3 years of giving them up, I was getting into trouble with boys! I had the WORST friends!", "Lol my husband's the same way with He-Man toys. We have shelves of them (especially the retro re-releases) in the basement and he and our daughter both play with them.", "My mom never let me have monster high as a kid, claiming it was satanic or something. I'm 20 and she finally agreed to get me my first one for Christmas this year lol. Like, I *could* get it myself, but it would feel like being a kid at Christmas again honestly. My first \"adult\" Christmas at 18 is when I got all the pots and pans, pot holders, etc, and I use everything a ton so I'm super grateful for those, but now I've got the basics that I need and can ask for toys again. I got a whole curio cabinet just for my littlest pet shops, though it has a lot more in it now, and I still bust them out to play with if I feel like I need to escape on rare occasions. Even if I didn't play with them, they're sitting there making me happy and I absolutely admire them, so I see no harm, and I finally started doing customazations this year since I got some fake LPS last Christmas :)\n\nAs long as I'm paying my bills and \"functioning\" as an adult, what's the harm, right? \n\nMy boyfriend and I still build blanket forts to play videogames, we still watch cartoons (currently watching adventure time), and honestly we just act like kids a lot. We'll play tag in the house and we tease each other often. But we're mature when we need to be, and I think there's a level of maturity at which one can recognize that one can be mature while enjoying \"childish\" things, and those that think they're all immature are confusing true maturity with the appearance of maturity.", "She\u2019ll do anything for a buck buck buck!", "i didn\u2019t pick up on that detail but man you\u2019re right. imagine the first time you meet your little niece you cant help but go through their belongings and then bug the family for days because you want to make cash from something thats not yours", "I also got the impression that they'd just met. Makes it all 1,000x worse!", "Idk I feel like buying something new from the store isn\u2019t the same as pressuring a child to part with their beloved toy because you\u2019re selfish and think your feelings matter more then theirs.", "True, though frankly I think that's for the best, the kid deserves to be kept out of this, the knowledge her weird pushy aunt cares more about her hobby than her family can wait until she's older lol", "YTA.  The mom said no.  It should have ended right there.    Stop pushing, it's over.", "Yeah they said no because you are trying to CON a child. Enjoy ruining your relationship with your brother over this. Trying to take a child's toy away because you want it screams next level entitlement. YTA", "Did you offer to buy her 5 dolls?  Or whatever the actual market value of the doll you want is?\n\nIs there any chance these dolls belonged to your sister-in-law when she was younger?  Or were given to your niece by a friend or family member of your sister-in-law?  Did you even both finding out if these dolls had some sentimental association for your SIL?", "You\u2019re a failed scam artist, accept it and move on.", "Did you ask your niece directly if she would like to exchange each doll for a new one (or any toy she wants)? This might be very valuable for her, as a kid who only gets secondhand toys, she might be yearning for new ones (I sure did but we couldn't afford it). If you make it fair, it can be a win-win, and she'd be the one insisting to her parents she wants to trade. Leave it as an open offer too, like \"when you outgrow them, you can still trade them in\". They are her dolls.", "That\u2019s my guess-if these are so rare they\u2019re prob moms and she let the daughter have them but they still are special to mom so she doesn\u2019t want to sell them.  OP needs to drop this.", "Even if it wasn\u2019t the mum\u2019s childhood toy (which I think they probably are) - it would likely have been the mum who went op-shopping and found the dolls for her daughter. That can have sentimental value too.\n\nThe dad didn\u2019t care because he wasn\u2019t the one that got them for the daughter. My partner wouldn\u2019t care about (most) of my daughter\u2019s toys being thrown away. As her mum and the one that stays home with her, I know all of her games and what toys she loves.", "I really suspect that they were.", "Ooohhh, I\u2019m bummed I don\u2019t get to see that!", "Aww damn, I would have liked to read that lol", "This.\n\nMy Dad bought me a fairly expensive plush toy back in the day (indulging me when I had fallen in love with it when passing by the store). I remember it was packed away with a few treasured items when I was a late teen in the misguided sense of not being a kid anymore, and after I moved out I mentioned how much I regretted not holding onto them. Turns out my parents had kept them safe, and also knew the collectors value of the plush specifically had significantly increased. I was delighted to be reunited with him, and he sits on my nightstand now (I'm in my 30s), a reminder of all the beautiful memories of childhood play, and also of the love of my father. Unless my circumstances significantly change, there will never be a time that the money will be important enough to want to part with it.\n\nI'm not saying that OP's niece will develop such a lasting connection, just that it is a beautiful thing to have a parent understand that sometimes as adults the gift of a sentimental item is such a precious thing to receive.", "I thought of Beanie Babies since I'd just listened to a podcast about the craze and all the money people lost thinking the stupid things were a good investment!", "OMG, Al! He was legit so annoying. He broke into Andy\u2019s mom\u2019s box to steal Woody when she locked him up in there with the cash bc she knew Woody wasn\u2019t supposed to be in the sale.\n\nFunny enough, Andy DID break/rip Woody and his mom put him all the way up in the shelf (where things are forgotten, like Wheezy). Wheezy and some forgotten toys were picked up by Andy\u2019s mom to sell in the yard sale but she explicitly did not take Woody even though she removed him from Andy (therefore Andy wasn\u2019t playing with him anymore).\n\nAl insisted on buying the toy (for cheap too, ofc.). When she said no, he got desperate and legitimately offered his watch. Then he stole him. Ugh.", "No, she wasn\u2019t to rescue them from the grips of a child who doesn\u2019t really need them or want them! Only she can truly appreciate them!\n\n/s.", "I'm a MH fan, and just a simple \"G1 Rochelle Goyle\" ebay search pulled up a G1 Rochelle who was a display doll with accessories for $50.  I have a non-core Rochelle that I would have rehomed to them easily if they posted looking for one in the right forums, because it's just sitting in a caboodle untouched.\n\nThis person is certainly a monster, and not one attending a fantasy HS.", "holy shit. time to dig up my old monster high dolls, provided i still have them.", "As a kid, my ex bf woke up one morning to find all his video games and sega gone. His mom told him someone broke in in the night and stole it all. 10 years later he found a box in the attic full of his games and the sega. His mom thought it was funny. Evil woman.", "Exactly, but OP clearly cares more about Having The Shiny Rare Thing (and resellable for a big price right?? Not that that's a factor at all \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02) and having it ALL TO HERSELF than about her niece's feelings, or about the childs parents' boundaries. She doesn't see the bonding opportunity because she doesn't care about that. The dolls are a trophy that matters more than family. Which is gross and sad and I feel for this poor little girl whose weird aunt cannot let shit go and stop trying to take her stuff - oh sorry, beg bribe or wear down the adults in her life to get THEM to take her stuff. Christ, this is genuinely pathetic. Not for the doll collection but the priorities.", "Maybe she doesn\u2019t want a replacement doll because she wants the dolls she already has.", "It doesn't matter. Her mother said no, so that should've been the end of it.", "Exactly! It\u2019s weird that she even obsessively asked like that", "No doubt. I gave my daughter my Gen 2 & 3 MLPs to play with. I would be *pissed* if an IL came after them with this attitude, and I *know* their monetary value. Love is more worthwhile than money.", "I gotta give OP's brother some credit though for knowing the girl played with them still. A lot of dads wouldn't notice a thing like that.", "Oh yea I agree. And honestly it doesn\u2019t even matter. The mom said no. The end.", "Go to OPs post and comment history, they made a comment on their own post and you can navigate to it.", "I'm so happy for you! And I love your parents!", "I have a set of stuffed dwarves from snow white that are really old. My daughter has them in her room and she knows they can play with them but they go back to me lol. My mom also saved them for me and gave them back.", "I still have my childhood teddybear sitting on my bed next to my pillow. I'm 30", "What I commented. My first beanie baby was Spot without the spot. It was my favorite toy for a very long time until my delusional mother caught the craze and I wasn\u2019t allowed to play with it anymore. No tag. Raggedy. Sat in a plastic container in my closet for me to stare at. \nUhg my mom sucks.", "She IS trying to rip them off. She wants 8 collector dolls from the little girl and would buy ONE new doll for her. How generous!", "A Caboodle!!! Nice memory, thank you!", "Are you still looking to rehome that doll?", "And buy them for less than she'd have to pay on eBay!", "Same,  I was waiting for that to turn sour but it was a sweet story!", "Yes. \nIt is the very definition of \"ripping off\" to low-ball a purchase price BECAUSE the owner doesn't know the value!", "You extrapolated from her comment about still playing with dolls that she's unemployed, maybe a thief, and sitting around waiting for a big Monster High doll payday? You've got a more vivid imagination than those of us who still play with dolls!", "She also stated they need restored. \n\nBut, these were prolly MOM's dolls. Monster High was a thing. Faded out. Just came back. G1's original owners, at the youngest end of the spectrum, are turning like, 22 this year. The older end of original G1 owners are late 20's. That is Mom's sentimental toy she's sharing with her kid. Leave it be.", "A 100 dollars after restoration and repair, labor and time shell be putting in to up their market value.\n\nUnless they're worth 100$ in their current state, that doesn't sounds like a bad deal?\n\nEither way, mom said no and it's wrong to be pushy. I'm just not sure that the price (which we don't know) offered will be a rip-off considering the restoration needed", "Growing up (70s / 80s) we had a swinging door connecting my dad\u2019s study with the kitchen. He used this giant old book missing its cover as a doorstop. \n\nWhen I went to college, I finally took a look at it and discovered it was a first-edition copy of Gone With the Wind! Was probably only worth $100 at the time due to the missing cover. Got him into collecting first editions.", "This seems very likely. I have shared my favourite bear with my daughter but there's no way in he'll I would give him to anyone else.", "I sell collectibles for a living. $15-$20 max for out of box, messed up hair, etc. Restored with all accessories and outfits could  be 100 or more depending on the character.", "Which makes trying to rip her off worse!! Why would you think it makes it better?"]}
