I was 17 and went through a bad experience which I will not get into and chose to keep my baby. I didn't have a job and Leilani's father said he wanted nothing to do with me or Leilani. It was a very hard experience but now I'm back on my feet and raising my beautiful girl. So onto what happened. Leilani's school was having a Fall Potluck and I made Jamaican-Style Roti with Leilani. While everyone was eating I was standing by the food stands when I overheard a teacher say and I quote \"Like a kid threw inside of it\". I was annoyed but decided to be the bigger person and just let it go. Later the same teacher asks if I brought it. I said yes and she laughed and made fun of my cooking. I said that just because she's uncultured doesn't mean my food is bad and she switched up. She said \"You're one to talk. You should be in college, not having kids \". She then called me an irresponsible mother. I saw red and told her that she looks far too old to be teaching and should be in a nursing home instead of being a teacher. She started crying and another mom told me to leave which I gladly did while grabbing Leilani. I emailed the principle about my experience and in response I got this.\n\nDear Ms. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*,\n\nI spoke to Mrs.\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* and she said along with the agreement of other witnesses that you made offensive remarks about her age.

Write a letter, and mention that you said something you regret after having been subjected to racist hatred. \n\nLet's be honest, that woman is a total racist, and you should NEVER have to deal with it. I might even consult an attorney, because if that woman is teaching kids, how are the kids being treated that are of color.\n\nI hate the culture of schools, but unfortunately those schools are like a cult. The teachers have power over your child. That is why I gave you the ESH.
