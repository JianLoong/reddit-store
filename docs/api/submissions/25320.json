I love her to death but she has these little habits that drive me insane. We just moved in together at the start of Aug\n\nFirst off, she doesn\u2019t really like to cook. I love to cook so I do it more often than she does. Because of this I decided the dishes are her job, it\u2019s only fair that if I cook dinner for both of us a few times a week, I don\u2019t do any dishes. Plus I work\n\nWe both work 12 hour shifts, mine are night shifts and hers are both. She\u2019s been off a few weeks because she got a concussion. So while I work my 3 shifts a week, she stays home. We had a fight the other day because I found out she made food for herself while I was working, and didn\u2019t tell me there was leftovers so I didn\u2019t know I could eat it when I got home the next morning. She also ate a chicken burger two days in a row while I was gone, I said it was excessive and that she shouldn\u2019t eat the same thing that often. She claims it was because she can\u2019t be up for long with her concussion, and they\u2019re easy\n\nShe snacks on random things. She won\u2019t just eat crackers, she\u2019ll eat cereal out of the box. She bought a box of fruit loops a week ago, today I saw her eating them dry and most of the bag was already gone. I took them out of her hands and put it away. She was mad but I told her cereal is expensive and she shouldn\u2019t just eat it like that. She does the same thing when she buys frozen fruit, I took that away from her too a couple times because she\u2019d eat it multiple days in a row\n\nI work 3 nights in a row a week, then I have 4 days off. I keep my schedule the rest of the week, because it\u2019s easier. I sleep around 7am most days and wake at 5pm. When I get up, I ask Allie to help me unpack my boxes and she never wants to. She claims it\u2019s because she\u2019s been up all day but I think she doesn\u2019t want to unpack my stuff. Since her heads been improving she\u2019s been unpacking more of her boxes, but it\u2019s a waste of time. She takes out books when my kitchen stuff is boxed. We don\u2019t need books out, and she puts her stuff places without checking if I\u2019m okay with it. Yesterday she said she was going to go to the store, I told her to stay home because we needed to unpack my stuff. We started unpacking a box but she got a headache and stopped\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to get most of my stuff unpacked since we moved in, because she\u2019s been concussed the whole time and can\u2019t help me. I\u2019ve been waiting for her but she\u2019s upset with me that I haven\u2019t unpacked anything myself, because apparently that\u2019s what I \u201cshould have been doing.\u201d\n\nShe got mad at me and said I\u2019m controlling since we moved in. I said she\u2019s overreacting; I\u2019m just trying to make sure she eats right and we each do half. She also got mad at me for my sleep schedule, because it\u2019s \u201chard\u201d being the one watching our 2 dogs all day. I feel like she\u2019s overreacting.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692778123, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yx9ye/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_shes_overreacting/", "score": 1777, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are controlling. Cut that shit out. She can eat whatever she wants, and it's not her job to help you unpack.

Don't tell her what to eat.\n2. Don't treat her like a servant.\n3. Unpack your own damn stuff.\n4. Don't tell her she's 'overreacting' when she criticizes your obviously dickish and controlling behavior.\n\nETA: YOU GRABBED FOOD AWAY FROM HER. That's beyond AH behavior. That's legitimately abusive. I hope once her concussion clears she's clearheaded enough to get the hell away from you.", "YTA. ***DAMN*** you are controlling AF. Why do you think you're the boss of what she can eat and how she eats it? Why does she have to unpack your shit -- you have two hands and aren't concussed! How dare she make food for herself while you are at work and eat it. Why does she need your permission before she does something or goes somewhere. YOU *ARE* CONTROLLING.\n\nETA: Did you get her to move in with you caveman style?", "YTA ~ she)s absolutely right, you *are* controlling. Not to mention that she\u2019s suffered a brain injury and instead of looking after her you\u2019re complaining that she isn\u2019t doing your share of the household chores, and that she\u2019s [checks notes] eating. Yikes, dude.\n\nYou are delusional if you think that cereal is too expensive as a snack - it\u2019s probably the cheapest thing there is.

Does your Food Police uniform have jackboots?", "YTA. You \" took food away\" from her because you did not approve of what she was eating.\n \nYou freaked out because she ate chicken burgers two days in a row.\n\nYou demanded she unpack your boxes.\n\nOh and she has a head injury.

You don't get to control and mould her into what you think she should be,", "YTA! You win the award for being the most controlling AH ever. Do you tell her when she is allowed to use the bathroom, also?", "Your girlfriend\u2019s recovering from a concussion and you\u2019re giving her a hard time over\u2026 eating frozen fruit out of the bag???\n\nWhy is that the absolute worst part of this to me somehow lol. YTA.", "YTA and very controlling.  How dare you snatch food away from her or berate her over eating chicken burgers two days in a row.  That's not normal behavior.  Are you possibly on the autism spectrum or perhaps struggling with OCD?   Why can't you unpack your own boxes?  You don't have a concussion, she does.  Again a creepy level of controlling.", "What the fuck is wrong with you? Why are you policing her? This is her house. You can ask her to do half and not police her every move. What kind of person takes food out of someone's hand and throws it away? What kind of person expects a person with concussion to unpack things of their partner like that? What kind of person expects their partner to consult where every little thing will go?\n\nYou're awful.", "YTA. In fact, YTControllingA. No need to say more.", "You are controlling and judgemental, she has a concussion and you're sulking because she's not helping you unpack? What are you, three? A concussion bad enough to hang around that long must have been fairly serious and why the hell does ot matter if she eats the same thing every night?\n\nI love how you say \"plus I work\" as if you're implying that she doesn't work at all before pointing out you both work and have the same schedules. Not to mention you make out she's on vacation when she's freaking recovering from a serious head injury.\n\nJesus... how did you NOT realise you're an AH here?\n\nYtA", "YTA, that is the textbook definition of controlling. Why should she, a grown woman, justify herself for what she eats ? If you are concerned about her diet, you can kindly make your suggestions without taking stuff away?\n\nSome more points: yes, of course she is frustrated about the dog issue. How much awake time do you even have left for her?\n\nThen: she is free to prioritise her books above other belongings, you don't get to micromanage that aspect either. Concussions can be tricky and one may feel out of it for a while.\n\nSo, OP,  no, she is not overreacting, in fact in her place I'd be so put off by this behavior I'd probably reconsider the relationship in case of no improvement. (Or maybe already now, the argument about the two-days-in-a-row chickenburger is unhinged enough that it can serve as an omen for the times to come).", "YTA. You are the controlling one and i hope she realizes what a mistake she made. Unpack your own things man and let her eat what she wants. Youre the worst dude", "YTA\n\n>She also ate a chicken burger two days in a row while I was gone, I said it was excessive and that she shouldn\u2019t eat the same thing that often. \n\nWhy not?   Seriously- why not? What will happen to her?\n\n\n>I work 3 nights in a row a week, then I have 4 days off.

Hypocrite much?", "Gf, if you read this, you deserve better than this abuse. Also, YTA", "YTA \ud83d\udcaf what the hell dude? If my partner grabbed food out of my hand, tried to tell me what I can and can't eat, demanded that I help him unpack his own boxes because for some reason you don't seem capable of doing it yourself and all of this while concussed...I would throw him right in the bin. Controlling doesn't even begin to explain the sorts of behavior you are displaying and you have only just moved in. You sound like a great big walking red flag", "YTA and you most definitely are controlling. Where do you get the audacity?", "YTA you\u2019re her boyfriend not her dad! If you tried any of that BS on me I would take my packed boxes and leave. Check yourself before you lose her.", "YTA 100%. Stop that shitty petulant behavior of yours immediately.", "Is this the Twilight Zone?

If anyone grabbed it out of my hands telling me not to eat it like that, they'd be getting the box dumped over their head, then I'd find some milk and dump that too. YTA, big time. Controlling, egotistical narcissist. You're the one who needs to grow up, dude.", "YTA\n\nyour only right about 1 thing. She shouldn't be unboxing her books, she should be boxing all her stuff so she could move out.", "YTA Why can\u2019t she eat what she wants to eat? When she wants to eat it?", "You are most certainly the asshole as well as the controlling and downright abusive one as well. You not only take food from her hands but you started off with \u201cwe got in a fight\u2026.\u201d So she eats something and you start a fight about it?!? What planet are you from? Do you hear yourself and how ridiculous you sound? You are not her parent or her keeper and she usually works just as much as you do so wtf is your problem? A loving partner, waif even a decent human being in general, would want a person to eat and to enjoy it. If you can\u2019t afford food all month long then apply for food stamps or go to a local food bank to supplement what you can and leave your gf who is healing from a BRAIN INJURY alone. If you were in any way interested in her well being or happiness you would be getting her whatever she wants to eat. And for anyone to need to stay home from work for weeks, she had a serious concussion and all that you can do is come home and pick a fight over chicken burgers?? Is any of this sounding really bad and cringe to you yet? I sure hope it is because you have issues and are an abusive person who needs to have so much control over your partner that it is even down to you knowing everything that she has had to eat all day long and that\u2019s some next level control shit. Do you monitor when and how much she goes to the bathroom too? I don\u2019t think it would surprise me. Do you do this with her about anything else? Like do you crawl up her ass and around the corner with money or where she is at every moment of the day? You can see how far control issues can reach so maybe it\u2019s time for you to walk away from her not only to do her the favor but so that you can take some time to get some help with your control issues and not be pushing them on anyone else in the meantime. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something you want to do or believe in ( therapy) but if you care about her at all, then let her go and do something about yourself. If you don\u2019t, then you can end up escalating and getting worse and worse with your obsessive \u201cneed to know\u201d mentality and it will be much more than just food intake. It can end up scarring this poor girl for the rest of her life but most guys like you don\u2019t actually care about your partner, you just need a warm body around to control so you feel like you\u2019re in control and you are powerful, and the truth is you\u2019re not, you\u2019re insecure or something else and you need to get deep down inside yourself and work through your shit with a professional. If you were with me, you would be the one with a concussion for trying to tell me what to eat and when I was allowed to eat it and your boxes would be unpacked when you got home, sure would be, right into a dumpster or in a fire pit with some matches. She has been tolerating your disgusting behavior so far but she has a braking point too so be careful and watch out if you decide to keep it up .\u270c\ud83c\udffb", "YTA.\n\nShe\u2019s right. You\u2019re controlling.\n\nUnpack your own stuff, she\u2019s not your servant.\n\nStop treating her like a three year old, and have some compassion for her concussion.\n\nHopefully she\u2019ll wise up and move on to someone who actually cares about her.", "Yta.

I love her to death but she has these little habits that drive me insane. We just moved in together at the start of Aug\n\nFirst off, she doesn\u2019t really like to cook. I love to cook so I do it more often than she does. Because of this I decided the dishes are her job, it\u2019s only fair that if I cook dinner for both of us a few times a week, I don\u2019t do any dishes. Plus I work\n\nWe both work 12 hour shifts, mine are night shifts and hers are both. She\u2019s been off a few weeks because she got a concussion. So while I work my 3 shifts a week, she stays home. We had a fight the other day because I found out she made food for herself while I was working, and didn\u2019t tell me there was leftovers so I didn\u2019t know I could eat it when I got home the next morning. She also ate a chicken burger two days in a row while I was gone, I said it was excessive and that she shouldn\u2019t eat the same thing that often. She claims it was because she can\u2019t be up for long with her concussion, and they\u2019re easy\n\nShe snacks on random things.
