I still don't think I'm the asshole\n\nEdit: I want to make it clear that Crissy is my best friend, we've known each other for almost 10 years. I'm not kicking her out of the role or asking her to step down. We're not fighting about this, she's very supportive about everything else except this one thing. I just wanted to know if I was being unreasonable expecting her to wear what I want\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm (32f) getting married in August. My best friend Crissy (fake name, 30f) agreed to be my maid of honor and seemed really excited for me. I told her I wanted my colors to be dark green and and pale pink and she agreed it was a really pretty combination. So when we were dress shopping she kept picking out green dresses. I told her I wanted her to wear pink instead. She was disappointed and said she doesn't like pink and would probably not buy a dress from the store we were at if it wasn't in a color she liked (because the boutique was pricy). I can understand that so I just asked that she find an appropriate dress in the specific shade of pink I like. Since then she has been sending me links to dresses that are NOT close to the color at all and green ones with pink floral. She made a comment about how when I was her maid of honor a few years ago, she let me buy a dress I've worn multiple times since. This pissed me off because her colors were navy and silver, so of course the blue dress she wanted me to buy is more versatile. But it's my turn now and I think the dress is a standard part of the maid of honor role. Its making me think she's not going to be a good maid of honor to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mentioned this to my sister and she said I was being a bridezilla. She reminded me that crissy was a really relaxed bride and that we obviously have different expectations about wedding roles and need to talk it out. I know she's probably right, but I'm upset that she thinks I'm being a bridezilla. Crissys wedding was a lot different than what I would have picked for myself- it was really casual and had a lot of cutesy, homemade elements. My style is more elegant and classy and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. When I first started talking to Crissy about my wedding plans, she kept reminding me that it's one day and just a party and stuff like that. But I have dreamed about this day since I was little. I feel like Crissy doesn't understand how important it is to me that my day is picture perfect because she admitted getting married wasn't ever really important to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 says he understands why I'm upset, my sister says I suck, and Crissy hasn't texted me back since I shot down the last few dresses she sent me.

Every dress she sent me was either too bright or too cool toned. Then she bought a dress without checking with me first and when she wanted to show it to me, it was a purpleish pink.

Being in the wedding party means maybe wearing something that isn\u2019t the most flattering on you specifically. The bride should be considerate of cost and preferences, but this is all very normal! MOH needs to knock it off with the suggestions and find a pink dress.
