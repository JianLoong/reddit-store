Why can't he use the iPad while the charger is plugged?", "NTA\n\n\nWanting to use your electronics is kind of fine?

That's insane.   \n\nHe can use the iPad with it plugged into the wall.  USB batteries for iPads have gotten really cheap now too.  He needs to figure out how to get his online work done with the pile of devices he already has, and let you have your 1 computer.   I'd tell him he's being ridiculous.", "NTA.  \nThis isn't healthy.

I don't know if it's a trust thing, or just a warm blankie 'i'm using my gf computer' feeling that is going on. But something is. It might be good to ask him why it's so important to use your computer when he has other options. \n\nBut you're definitely NTA. You do need to do a better job of defending your boundaries. No, should mean no. He'll squawk the first few times, until he realizes you really mean it. I don't know if you're a man or woman. but I say this to my girlfriends all the time. Men trust what we do, and rarely listen to what we say. \n\nIf you mean you don't want him to use your computer. Don't let him use it. Change the password, lock it up.

Your BF has alternatives -- several, in fact. You have already argued over his desire to use your computer for these classes instead of his own, so he knows that this is a boundary you have established. He is the AH for refusing to respect your boundaries. His failure to plan ahead (charge his iPad, get a portable charger in case it dies, install Skype on his other computers, etc.) does not make you the AH.", "NTA, he's being a massive asshole, stop letting him use your devices entirely, don't share passwords.", "You posted about this 2months ago.

You just don't want to use yours, he can read instead.", "NTA. It sounds like he's trying to sabotage you. Keep using your stuff so you can't get things done by deadline and end up failing at them. Password protect your computer. Focus on your deadlines. For some reason, he doesn't like seeing you achieve things.", "NTA\n\nMaybe he is snooping through your stuff when he uses your computer? \n\nHe is clearly going out of his way to have a reason. \n\nNot 100%, but there is some sort of ulterior reason going on here.", "Seconded on password protection.", "4 actually. 2 work computers, 1 personal computer and 1 iPad. Also I am pretty sure you can download Skype on your smartphone, so 5, 6 if he has 2 cellulars. About the iPad... Can't he use it while it's charging?", "Yeah this is kinda a red flag that he's just trying to control you rather than really about the computer itself.   Like he wants your computer specifically to plant a flag showing he controls everything under this roof.   Hopefully that's not the case, but watch for other signs.", "He has no actual reason. I asked him to give me a valid reason and he had none. Now he\u2019s annoyed and is saying I\u2019m fucking annoying. Which is hurtful because I\u2019m right and I never use the world \u201cfucking\u201d toward him. I find it quite disrespectful. I can\u2019t believe he would say something like to me because of a computer", "I thought about installing it myself but I don\u2019t want to. I shouldn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s not my job to install it for him. So I\u2019m not doing it in the end.", "We have access to each other electronic devices (phone, iPad, computers). It is not strange for one  of us to pick up the first phone next to them to Google something. So I don\u2019t think he has anything to hide.\n\nI\u2019m a woman and I agree with you. Only actions matter, if I stand my ground he see that I\u2019m not letting him uses my computer when I need it. If I just say it, nothing will ever change", "He can use the iPad while it\u2019s charging but it is quite slow to charge compare to a computer. So he might be using more battery than what\u2019s getting charged", "\n\nYou are right. He has even more option. \n\n\n\nThis is clearly about lazyness and getting your way and not about \"if he could do that\".", "I see what you mean. I\u2019m thinking about some other stuff he does and maybe there\u2019s some of that. But I\u2019m \u201cstubborn\u201d so I always point out things I find disrespectful. I have clear boundaries and I will say something when he\u2019s crossing them.", "You need to leave this relationship, this sounds like highly toxic behaviour and seems like he is trying to control you.", "Well definitely NTA, honestly seems like he's hiding something", "That\u2019s fair. I was just trying to think of an easier solution that was less argumentative for you, but at the end of the day his attitude is the problem, and if he\u2019s going to behave this way over a computer, where else is this attitude going to manifest.", "Yep...and I was more thinking he might be the one with trust issues. Hence, wanting access to your computer.", "Yet you're still in this relationship with an immature fool.", "NTA. Your bf is acting like a spoiled, entitled child. I would be concerned with what his behaviour says about what your relationship will look like in a few years. They say that one way to see what a man is really like is to tell him \"no\" about something inconsequential. You're telling him \"no\", and he is acting childish and petty.", "NTA. He has his own stuff.", "He has three computers and an iPad and still wants to use your computer. Nope. He's just being lazy.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, your boyfriend is being an AH though.", "NTA.\n\nHe's messed up. There is less than zero reasons for him to use any of the many alternatives to using your stuff.\n\nHe's a snooper or a wannabe stalker. \n\nIf he wasn't either of these and (I'm sorry to use such a tired outdated term), but a real man, this wouldn't even be close to a thing. A grown up i guess i mean.\n\nSo, he's either,\n\n1-a snooper\n2-a wannabe stalker\n3-very immature and selfish.\n\nThis isn't even a red flag.

He's old enough to figure it out.", "He uses your stuff so he can check your messages & emails live most likely. To me it sounds more like a control issue", "NTA, and why can\u2019t he use his own computer? That\u2019s just weird to me. Plus, I realize you\u2019re in a relationship but you still need to be careful about passwords and accounts.", "NTA put passwords on all your devices so he can't use them. Sounds like a control issue over you.", "NTA. Why does he have his own \"GADGETS\" and only want to use \"YOUR ONLY ONE\"? This should be the eye opener for you. OP you need to love yourself first.", "FFS, tell him to put the iPad on the charger and keep using it. He can get a longer charger cord if necessary. Get one with a right angle connection so it doesn't poke downwards. Sheesh. What a baby! Why do you put up with this? NTA", "Boyfriend is an entitled asshole. Stop sharing your one device with a guy who has multiple other options.

This will infuriate him.  Hint, hint, he wants YOUR computer to snoop, not do his lesson.", "Our iPad isn't that slow to charge.  I admit I have no idea how much data/energy taking the Japanese lesson uses.", "Controlling people only get their 'fix' from controlling spirited people.\n\nIt isn't a thrill for them if the person naturally doesn't care or have boundaries.\n\nIt is in the breaking down/crushing their spirit that they enjoy.\n\nSo, you either need to be on guard for him wearing you down, or you need to find a healthy relationship."]}
