I cut the two of them out of my life and declared they were dead to me. They had a child who is now 4 but maybe close to 5 now, I'm not sure. I have never met the child. I never wanted to meet the child or be in their life. My parents knew their grandchild and supported the child while my sister and ex were alive. They were on and off after I left him. I heard from friends that their breakups were quite explosive. When they died in a car accident recently people were shocked, but also kind of not, because a lot of people assumed they were arguing and didn't focus on the road. Their child went into foster care. My parents tried to take them but were denied on the grounds of health and mobility. The child's paternal relatives did not want to take the child, no surprises there though, and so my parents turned to me.\n\nI am now engaged again, to Luke, and we bought our forever home last year. We are stable and happy and my parents believe I/we should take their grandchild. I told them I would not be a good fit to raise the child and I was sorry, but that was the end of the discussion as far as I'm concerned. Luke told them he was with me on that. My parents went behind my back to try and talk him into it but he told me and I told them to stop. They begged me again to reconsider and said imagine how nice it would be to know my nibling, to get to be there, to have a child who is part of our family kept in our family and raised lovingly around people who want the best for them. I told them that is not a job for me and to let it go. A few days went by and I thought they might have let it drop. Then they call and tell me to think about how good it will look, for me, the betrayed sister and ex-fianc\u00e9e to have enough love and compassion to raise the child that was conceived out of said betrayal and love them and be the best mom to that child who could exist. They said people would think I'm a saint and would always think of me as an incredible person. I told them I am no saint, I do not want to be a saint, I don't need to be seen as some incredible, amazing person and I am not going to raise their grandchild just to look good to other people and they need to stop asking me to.\n\nThey told me I was heartless and asked how I could not care at all about a child who is my own flesh and blood who has been tossed around the system in just a few weeks, because according to them the child has been in 4 homes already. They said I should not be able to turn my back on family like this and I should have more compassion for them, who were told by CPS they will not be allowed to raise their grandchild.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682340316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xeimq/aita_for_shutting_down_my_parents_by_saying_i/", "score": 480, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Least when the person went NC with family of that betrayal. Sounds more like the ideal setup for an evil step mother...", "NTA. Your parents are clearly trying to stay in the life of a child they have bonded over, but that\u2019s not on you. And it\u2019s not fair to the child to be raised by someone who\u2019s going to hate it.", "NTA. Raising a child, even a relation, is no small obligation.

And doing it to \u201clook good\u201d is the absolute wrong motivation. \n\nYou told your parents \u201cno.\u201d As tough as a situation as this is, the need to accept this.

More than family that child is the sole face of the uttermost pain, disrespect, betrayal and contempt you suffered from someone who is supposed to be your family. So you had every right to turn your back to your so called sister and whatever happens is not up to you to fix. Also when you have your own kids, the sisters kid would be just someone who is there and I very much doubt if you or your fiancee would be able to love or even be impartial towards him/ her. What your parents are doing to you is showing disrespect and you have every right to want a life of your own as its not who did anything wrong but is still being forced to have to deal with an issue that's not yours.

Your sister and ex failed their child by not making a will to determine who would take their child in the event of their passing. They had 4 years to do this and didn\u2019t.

I see so many kids in the system, and having a relative or friend care for them is so much more beneficial then having a random person. Your parents are suffering from the mistakes of your sister and the sucky part is, if the kiddo does go into the system and get adopted, the chances of your parents having a relationship with the child are slim (unless they get an AMAZING worker and foster care family that will coordinate visits throughout the child\u2019s life). Are there any family friends that would take the child? In my state, kiddos can be placed in kinship with friends of the family as long as they pass a home-study and are physically fit!", "NTA. Kids are a huge responsibility and considering your past with the childs parents, does not sound like it will be the best environment for the child (no offense). Surprised they denied your parents (unless they are in absolutely terrible shape). Hoping for the best for that poor baby.", "NTA. Would it look good? Of course it would. But it's flat-out cruel to expect someone to raise a symbol of such a fundamental and terrible personal betrayal, and to try and guilt you into doing so is abusive. Your parents are the heartless ones.", "NTA. I feel for your parents and their grandkid.  I can understand why they came up with the idea (bad as it is), and it was within normal bounds for them to ask you....ONCE. You said (quite understandably \"NO.\"  They seriously need to drop it.

They are also trying to manipulate you into doing something which is a huge responsibility.", "NTA. \nYou have a perfectly valid reason to not raise this child.

I\u2019d suggest speaking to the social worker directly and immediately and letting them know that you\u2019re not going to take custody at all.
