I cut the two of them out of my life and declared they were dead to me. They had a child who is now 4 but maybe close to 5 now, I'm not sure. I have never met the child. I never wanted to meet the child or be in their life. My parents knew their grandchild and supported the child while my sister and ex were alive. They were on and off after I left him. I heard from friends that their breakups were quite explosive. When they died in a car accident recently people were shocked, but also kind of not, because a lot of people assumed they were arguing and didn't focus on the road. Their child went into foster care. My parents tried to take them but were denied on the grounds of health and mobility. The child's paternal relatives did not want to take the child, no surprises there though, and so my parents turned to me.\n\nI am now engaged again, to Luke, and we bought our forever home last year. We are stable and happy and my parents believe I/we should take their grandchild. I told them I would not be a good fit to raise the child and I was sorry, but that was the end of the discussion as far as I'm concerned. Luke told them he was with me on that. My parents went behind my back to try and talk him into it but he told me and I told them to stop. They begged me again to reconsider and said imagine how nice it would be to know my nibling, to get to be there, to have a child who is part of our family kept in our family and raised lovingly around people who want the best for them. I told them that is not a job for me and to let it go. A few days went by and I thought they might have let it drop. Then they call and tell me to think about how good it will look, for me, the betrayed sister and ex-fianc\u00e9e to have enough love and compassion to raise the child that was conceived out of said betrayal and love them and be the best mom to that child who could exist. They said people would think I'm a saint and would always think of me as an incredible person. I told them I am no saint, I do not want to be a saint, I don't need to be seen as some incredible, amazing person and I am not going to raise their grandchild just to look good to other people and they need to stop asking me to.\n\nThey told me I was heartless and asked how I could not care at all about a child who is my own flesh and blood who has been tossed around the system in just a few weeks, because according to them the child has been in 4 homes already. They said I should not be able to turn my back on family like this and I should have more compassion for them, who were told by CPS they will not be allowed to raise their grandchild.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682340316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xeimq/aita_for_shutting_down_my_parents_by_saying_i/", "score": 1343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

More than family that child is the sole face of the uttermost pain, disrespect, betrayal and contempt you suffered from someone who is supposed to be your family. So you had every right to turn your back to your so called sister and whatever happens is not up to you to fix. Also when you have your own kids, the sisters kid would be just someone who is there and I very much doubt if you or your fiancee would be able to love or even be impartial towards him/ her. What your parents are doing to you is showing disrespect and you have every right to want a life of your own as its not who did anything wrong but is still being forced to have to deal with an issue that's not yours.

How does this warrant a kid being put into a system that more often than not gives children a hard life, forgotten and rarely supported, even when they were put in for their own safety in the first place...Children are 8x more likely to be abused by non biological caregivers than if they were with their bio families.\nUltimately no matter what happened, its an innocent kid that suffers and if that kid coming looking for you all their bio family as an adult, you'll have to answer to them and rejecting them again will absolutely make you an AH.\n\nI'm not saying you should parent if you're not in a position to, that's fair enough but maybe find a way to talk to cps and maybe offer to help your parents in some form where they are parenting but cps are comfortable with you being around in what ever that looks like.  \n\nThis is going to sound a bit harsh but I mean it in a emotional wellbeing point of view not towards your character, but it sounds like kid wouldn't be emotionally safe with you because of how you're feeling, that wouldn't be fair on the kid but would be with your parents (assuming they're good parents).\n\nI know considering what happened its really hard and I really do feel for you, you should never have had to go through that and absolutely with you about turning your backs on them because what they did was more than s**t and unforgivable but think from the child's point of view not you or your parents as adults", "Foster care is a HORRIBLE place, and should be avoided when at all possible. There was a post recently (which has since been removed) about a man who refused to take in his niece and nephew, resulting in them being separated and bounced around in foster care for years. \n\nGiven the situation, the paternal relatives should be the ones to help this poor kid, and it's awful that they won't. It sounds like your parents want to, but the state isn't allowing it, which is cruel. \"Health and mobility\" don't sound like good reasons to keep a kid in a broken system. Have you thought about hiring a lawyer to try and argue the case with the state? \n\nI understand why you don't want to raise the child, and no, you shouldn't raise them \"to look good\", but how about raising them so a child doesn't end up abused and traumatized? The child isn't to blame for what happened; they didn't ask to be born. \n\nI mean, NTA, but... yeah...", "I feel so sorry for this poor child.  None of this history and situation is their fault but they will bear the consequences. So incredibly sad.", "This is a crappy situation for that poor child. It sounds like your parents are the AH for saying it will \"look good\" but, I'll also add that adoptive and foster parents aren't saints. They are just people being parents via another method. Simple as that. This is coming from a parent in the community. Some parents, biological, foster, or adoptive are crappy parents. Some are great.\n\nI'll also add that keeping a child in the family, if safe, is typically a better solution than having them continue in the system. My heart breaks for this poor child and the trauma he's already endured. \n\nBecause you knew both parents, even though those memories are painful, please consider sharing what you know with your niece. Even if you aren't going to take custody, if you can pass on information about her heritage as she gets older, that will be a huge blessing and gift to her if she ever wants to know.", "I'm so sorry what. I know several people who went through foster system in America and that shits hella fuck up. I'm sorry for what you went through but honestly rethink it.

Please keep in mind that despite all the ill will and permanently unresolved issues between yourself and your sister and ex, your niece never asked for any of this. Not to be born, much less as the result of an affair. Not to lose her parents in a accident. And not to be placed in foster care because the only members of her family willing to take her in are being denied on the basis of their health.\n\nYour feelings in this entire matter are entirely valid. But there are times where our feelings aren't worth shit in the face of making the right decision. And based purely on the statistics of how children in foster care turn out, leaving your niece there when there are viable options in you, your fianc\u00e9, and ex-fianc\u00e9's families is absolutely the wrong decision to make, and an AH one at that.\n\nYou, Luke and your ex's family all need to put on your big people pants and sit down and talk about what is best for your niece regardless of how any of you feel about the situation, because your feelings don't get to decide how her life turns out. And if you do end up taking her in, you can always tell your parents you're doing it because it's right and that they should stfu about appearances because you legit don't give a rats ass about that.\n\nBut hey, if you want to leave her in the system and increase her risk of abuse and exploitation, by all means.", "personally, i would take the kid in. it seems like the right thing to do.\n\nyou're NTA for not wanting to, but the kid needs help. it's a crisis. someone in the family should do something.", "Are you saying no because of your anger toward her parents? Is this some sort of revenge for what they did?

Foster care is horrible and your niece may never have a chance at a good life. I\u2019m not saying you have to take her, but how about making sure she gets adopted by a good family?

While I am sympathetic to your parents position, you are not responsible for altering your life to accommodate their need.

Plus, if you did take the child your parents would be larger presence in your life than if it's just you and your partner. weigh up all options and be strong enough to stick to your initial convictions.", "what about the kid? she is living a nightmare and you could help but refuse.\n\ni don't understand this.", "Plus their asshole daughter didn't care about flesh and blood when shacking up with her own sister's fiance.", "[removed]", "I'm younger Gen X and could literally have a kid entering their 30's right now. Older Gen X are in their late 50s.", "Oof that sucks :( well too bad for the kid but if she ended up in a place where people resent her for her existence, that will do more damage i guess. And it\u2019s sad that the foster care system is having a rough time finding a better stable family for her..", "I worked with planned Parenthood in my area for a while. Its way different. The parents here would wait YEARS to adopt a baby right out of the womb than to adopt a child that's old enough to not fall off a playpen. And in this case. The kids not going to get reunited with the family. And I could be wrong but from what I know, age itself is a qualifications that throws many parents off. You could be 55, fit, healthy and rich and they would not give u the kid. And I will be honest, most people don't adopt cause they are kind generous kids loving people. They adopt to complete a family fantasy and kids that's aren't fresh fetus just don't fit perfectly there.", "You can \"believe\" what you want, but I promise you, it isn't better for her. None of the people in her foster world are family or friend. She has no stability, no support network, and will likely face physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse at some point on her journey through they system by the people who are supposed to be caring for her and/or living with her and when that happens she will have no one to tell and no place to go. The day she turns 18 she will be kicked out of the system w/ a couple hundrend bucks and wave goodbye.\n\nAgain, you are NTA for not taking her, and yes, she would be better off w/ other family or friends, but she isn't w/ family or friends. She will not be better off in foster care than in a stable home, free abuse, where she can develop a solid support network and therapy, even if that home isn't ideal. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying this to change your mind, but I hate this idea that keeps getting perpetuated that foster care is somehow ok for kids, that is works out just fine for them,  b/c the numbers and the reality of lived lives don't reflect that. Babies generally get adopted out of foster care fairly quickly. Traumatized kids get shuffled around and sometimes get lucky and find a good place to land w/ someone who cares deeply about them, but not after going through a lot. And sometimes those stable places are only stable for a little while, then something changes and they get shuffled again.", "If you think you could raise her without sexually abusing her, it would be a better situation for her than foster care.\n\nAgree with the other poster, you are NTA for not wanting to take on this responsibility, but you also don\u2019t get to say you\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for the child.", "That makes more sense why they would be denied long term.", "Are you ready to lose your relationship with them over not helping ?    You don\u2019t have to take the kid in but you can call and see what can be done.  You can try to help them visit their grandparents.\n\nEdit: people downvoting.  You really think her parents who are grieving the loss of their daughter are just going to shrug and say ok OP?  They will resent her not helping and it will damage her relationship with them.  Her parents will tell her future children about their cousin.   She can not help. That\u2019s her right.  But it will have consequences for the relationship with her parents.  That\u2019s reality.", "Yeah, i said it wasnt.\n\nI said they could, if they wanted.", "It does when they are a bio family member who is the deciding factor to what happens to that child. Again as I said I'm not telling OP to parent the kid I'm saying help the kid stay in the family where the kid belongs and will have a less traumatic future. \n\nAnd it isn't 1 kid, its lots of kids this happens to all over the world where families reject them because of adults failures and family arguments", "No. She doesn\u2019t. But she could.  Her parents are clearly distraught over this and she admits not even caring about them.", "Cool then you can foster the kid. I'm sure op can let you know the location since you feel so strongly about stepping up.", "I don't know them and I am not part of their family. I am better off doing this. The child is not my priority.", "The child was conceived through her sister and ex fianc\u00e9's love affair. While it's sad that the child is now in this predicament, in all honesty, it's not OP's problem.\n\nYes, they COULD help them. Are they obligated to? No. The ONLY reason OP's parents want them to take the child in is so that OP will \"look good for taking her fianc\u00e9's cheat baby and awmaigawd look, she forgave them for ruining the marriage, how cutesy wutesy!\"\n\nNo. Absolutely not.", "By that logic, she could have adopted any child living in foster care when her housing and marital situations became stable, and so could many other people.\n\nAnd if you can't see why it would be hard for many people to love a child that is a reminder of a betrayal, I don't think anyone can find the words to explain you, honestly.", "So why should kid's nightmare become OP's nightmare?\n\nKid's parents should have taken steps, they didn't.\n\nThe dead parents don't even apparently have any \\*friends\\* who would take the kid in, meaning either they don't have friends or the kid's a fucking nightmare in itself.\n\nNot OP's circus, not OP's monkeys.", "How many children have you adopted? You have about as much relation to this kid as OP.", "would the child be better off being raised by someone who might not be able to keep from resenting them?", "Would you take in a random kid? Bc as she's had no presence in kiddo's life and the parents are, understandably, as dead to her as they are dead in the ground and for longer still, that makes kiddo as much to OP as any random kid to you. So unless you're opening up every home in your house to foster kids, take the log out of your own eye.", "The fact there isn't a set permanency plan probably isn't helping. OP's parents are probably telling the case worker that their other daughter is \"considering\" kinship placement. In that case, she would likely be bouncing around temporary homes rather than being put in a permanent or semi-permanent placement. The sooner OP's parents consent to permanency and/or adoption with CPS, the more likely she is to get a permanent or adoptive placement.", "CPS is so overrun I\u2019m having a hard time believing they were denied. Even if they have health issues, if they were willing, it seems surprising the court felt bounced around in foster care was better.", "Agreed.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It's something you made up insofar as this situation goes.\n\nWhat you're doing is a grade A, full-fat guilt trip on a total stranger. Go train to be a foster parent and improve the system.", "Nope.\n\nThe child is a stranger and evidence of betrayal.\n\nKid stands a better chance with a stranger than with OP, and OP is proper to reject the kid.", "Thank you for weighing in on this. Agreed that OP is NTA here, but maybe is just a general A...H in life. I honestly am having trouble imagining the complete lack of compassion for this poor kid and not being able to separate the resentment from a child that had no hand in the betrayal.", "I suspect the grandparents are pressing any buttons they think would remotely work to keep the child, part of their lost daighter close to them. They'd be better petitioning the CPS to try and maintain a connection with child. And I suspect they'd interfere a lot in raising the child. But I think their motives overall are more from grief and trying to keep family together but shouldn't be at OP's expense.", "That's incredibly sad. Sounds like your nibling didn't have the best life even before the parents died. It's also not your problem.", "No I am not surrounded by financially stable people. I know not everyone can afford life insurance premiums, I know that\u2019s a reality for many. If someone is genuinely in that boat I feel for them. But the number of people I know who live for payday and don\u2019t have life insurance but do have multiple streaming subscriptions (each more expensive than a basic life insurance policy) helps with the boggling.\n\nTop it off with not even having a conversation with a chosen trusted person to be your child\u2019s guardian, to not even try to ensure a safe and loving home, and the boggle is complete.", "As a former CPS worker, I found it was best to get information first hand. We would have parents saying, oh my mom will take the kids, only to find out mom wanted nothing to do with the situation. I could see one temporary placement, in emergency situations, that is usually the only option. Placements after that should be less transitory.", "OP says they have mobility issues too. With a very young child, I can see why the grandparents might not have been deemed as a suitable placement.", "Serious question - have you ever been truly betrayed in the way OP was?", "Funny. I saw another reddit where the mom was force to raise a kid cause of the husband's affair. She raised the kid well just didn't love the kid and the whole reddit was on her tail calling her the AH. What's the difference here?", "It's a matter of degrees... If the mom had the choice between raising the kid and abandoning that kid to a system where the child was likely to be further traumatized, then raising the kid was the better choice. She's less of an AH for raising the child, even with the resentment present, than she would have been if she had just left the kid entirely."]}
