I cut the two of them out of my life and declared they were dead to me. They had a child who is now 4 but maybe close to 5 now, I'm not sure. I have never met the child. I never wanted to meet the child or be in their life. My parents knew their grandchild and supported the child while my sister and ex were alive. They were on and off after I left him. I heard from friends that their breakups were quite explosive. When they died in a car accident recently people were shocked, but also kind of not, because a lot of people assumed they were arguing and didn't focus on the road. Their child went into foster care. My parents tried to take them but were denied on the grounds of health and mobility. The child's paternal relatives did not want to take the child, no surprises there though, and so my parents turned to me.\n\nI am now engaged again, to Luke, and we bought our forever home last year. We are stable and happy and my parents believe I/we should take their grandchild. I told them I would not be a good fit to raise the child and I was sorry, but that was the end of the discussion as far as I'm concerned. Luke told them he was with me on that. My parents went behind my back to try and talk him into it but he told me and I told them to stop. They begged me again to reconsider and said imagine how nice it would be to know my nibling, to get to be there, to have a child who is part of our family kept in our family and raised lovingly around people who want the best for them. I told them that is not a job for me and to let it go. A few days went by and I thought they might have let it drop. Then they call and tell me to think about how good it will look, for me, the betrayed sister and ex-fianc\u00e9e to have enough love and compassion to raise the child that was conceived out of said betrayal and love them and be the best mom to that child who could exist. They said people would think I'm a saint and would always think of me as an incredible person. I told them I am no saint, I do not want to be a saint, I don't need to be seen as some incredible, amazing person and I am not going to raise their grandchild just to look good to other people and they need to stop asking me to.\n\nThey told me I was heartless and asked how I could not care at all about a child who is my own flesh and blood who has been tossed around the system in just a few weeks, because according to them the child has been in 4 homes already. They said I should not be able to turn my back on family like this and I should have more compassion for them, who were told by CPS they will not be allowed to raise their grandchild.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682340316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xeimq/aita_for_shutting_down_my_parents_by_saying_i/", "score": 4025, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

More than family that child is the sole face of the uttermost pain, disrespect, betrayal and contempt you suffered from someone who is supposed to be your family. So you had every right to turn your back to your so called sister and whatever happens is not up to you to fix. Also when you have your own kids, the sisters kid would be just someone who is there and I very much doubt if you or your fiancee would be able to love or even be impartial towards him/ her. What your parents are doing to you is showing disrespect and you have every right to want a life of your own as its not who did anything wrong but is still being forced to have to deal with an issue that's not yours.

How does this warrant a kid being put into a system that more often than not gives children a hard life, forgotten and rarely supported, even when they were put in for their own safety in the first place...Children are 8x more likely to be abused by non biological caregivers than if they were with their bio families.\nUltimately no matter what happened, its an innocent kid that suffers and if that kid coming looking for you all their bio family as an adult, you'll have to answer to them and rejecting them again will absolutely make you an AH.\n\nI'm not saying you should parent if you're not in a position to, that's fair enough but maybe find a way to talk to cps and maybe offer to help your parents in some form where they are parenting but cps are comfortable with you being around in what ever that looks like.  \n\nThis is going to sound a bit harsh but I mean it in a emotional wellbeing point of view not towards your character, but it sounds like kid wouldn't be emotionally safe with you because of how you're feeling, that wouldn't be fair on the kid but would be with your parents (assuming they're good parents).\n\nI know considering what happened its really hard and I really do feel for you, you should never have had to go through that and absolutely with you about turning your backs on them because what they did was more than s**t and unforgivable but think from the child's point of view not you or your parents as adults", "Foster care is a HORRIBLE place, and should be avoided when at all possible.

It sounds like your parents want to, but the state isn't allowing it, which is cruel. \"Health and mobility\" don't sound like good reasons to keep a kid in a broken system. Have you thought about hiring a lawyer to try and argue the case with the state? \n\nI understand why you don't want to raise the child, and no, you shouldn't raise them \"to look good\", but how about raising them so a child doesn't end up abused and traumatized?

Some are great.\n\nI'll also add that keeping a child in the family, if safe, is typically a better solution than having them continue in the system. My heart breaks for this poor child and the trauma he's already endured. \n\nBecause you knew both parents, even though those memories are painful, please consider sharing what you know with your niece.

The day she turns 18 she will be kicked out of the system w/ a couple hundrend bucks and wave goodbye.\n\nAgain, you are NTA for not taking her, and yes, she would be better off w/ other family or friends, but she isn't w/ family or friends. She will not be better off in foster care than in a stable home, free abuse, where she can develop a solid support network and therapy, even if that home isn't ideal. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying this to change your mind, but I hate this idea that keeps getting perpetuated that foster care is somehow ok for kids, that is works out just fine for them,  b/c the numbers and the reality of lived lives don't reflect that. Babies generally get adopted out of foster care fairly quickly. Traumatized kids get shuffled around and sometimes get lucky and find a good place to land w/ someone who cares deeply about them, but not after going through a lot. And sometimes those stable places are only stable for a little while, then something changes and they get shuffled again.", "If you think you could raise her without sexually abusing her, it would be a better situation for her than foster care.\n\nAgree with the other poster, you are NTA for not wanting to take on this responsibility, but you also don\u2019t get to say you\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for the child.", "That makes more sense why they would be denied long term.", "Are you ready to lose your relationship with them over not helping ?

You really think her parents who are grieving the loss of their daughter are just going to shrug and say ok OP?  They will resent her not helping and it will damage her relationship with them.

No. The ONLY reason OP's parents want them to take the child in is so that OP will \"look good for taking her fianc\u00e9's cheat baby and awmaigawd look, she forgave them for ruining the marriage, how cutesy wutesy!\"\n\nNo. Absolutely not.", "By that logic, she could have adopted any child living in foster care when her housing and marital situations became stable, and so could many other people.\n\nAnd if you can't see why it would be hard for many people to love a child that is a reminder of a betrayal, I don't think anyone can find the words to explain you, honestly.", "So why should kid's nightmare become OP's nightmare?\n\nKid's parents should have taken steps, they didn't.\n\nThe dead parents don't even apparently have any \\*friends\\* who would take the kid in, meaning either they don't have friends or the kid's a fucking nightmare in itself.\n\nNot OP's circus, not OP's monkeys.", "How many children have you adopted?

If the mom had the choice between raising the kid and abandoning that kid to a system where the child was likely to be further traumatized, then raising the kid was the better choice.

But I can certainly see your point as well, there is a lot of emotional baggage for both sides. Kids that are in that situation will not be easy to raise either.

I totally understand that this isn't what OP would have chosen but to me the negatives of potential suffering and abuse to an innocent vulnerable member of your family (however much you might not feel like this child is right now) far outweighs OPs desire to hold a grudge. If OP would abandon this child in the same way had her sister not betrayed her in this way/the father wasn't OPs ex etc... that would somehow make it better in my mind, in that OP would not want to help regardless, not out of spite for a wrong her sister committed but either way I can't imagine being OK with that course of action and not spending the rest of my life wondering what fate had befallen this poor child.", "NAH. Completely reasonable for you guys and also understanding of the parents. It must be miserable feeling being incapable of raising your grandkid and spending your final years knowing you have a grandkid in care.", "They were just grasping at straws. They don't want the child to be placed in the system. It must be devasting for them that they're willing to raise the child but deemed unsuitable to do so. But I understand it's tough for you because you have such a history with them. So, NAH.", "NTA\n\nI am usually one to say siblings should step up in case of needs, but taking that child will not do it service. The child needs to be adopted into a loving family, not someone who will be reminded of the betrayal every time they sees them.", "I agree with everyone here. Fuck that kid. Let it rot in the system.", "NAH", "NAH. You are in no way obligated to raise this child regardless of their genetic make-up. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t blame your parents, either.  They\u2019ve lost a child and are scared of losing their grandchild - the only remaining link to their child. I\u2019m sure they aren\u2019t thinking clearly and are pulling at any straw they can find. Does it make their behavior RIGHT? Not at all.  Grief and panic make people act in all sorts of crazy ways. \n\nGood thoughts to all of y\u2019all in this situation.", "NAH. OP, I'm sorry to hear you and your family are going through this. Unless your parents have a preexisting pattern of this type of behavior, I would assume they are acting out of a mix of grief, fear, and desperation and they are grasping at straws trying to keep their grandchild out of the system. I wouldn't take their behavior and comments personally (unless there is a larger pattern here) but you are right to set boundaries and have a right to feel how you feel. \n\nAre you or your parents aware of any friends of the family or more distant relatives who might be willing to take placement and/or adopt? As a former caseworker, most of the time CPS would prefer to place in a relative or kinship placement over formal foster homes if at all possible, especially if foster homes are in short supply.", "Your family look like is not property functional, but this could be your change to change it, the love for this child would go over any feel that you have from the parents. Not saying that you are the a** but you could look at it with loving eyes. Having a child is something that changes our life for better. You would overcome any bad feeling. I would definitely do it in your place.", "Ugh\u2026.. NTA\n\nBUT!!! I feel so bad for that child. They did nothing wrong. They are being held accountable for the mistakes of others and hopefully they will be adopted. If they are not, their suffering will be most likely severe. At least from my experience with foster care it will be. So while you have no obligation to the child and I understand your position. I feel way worse for the orphan that is about to be dumped off on people that are not always kind and who can abuse them. All because they had the misfortune to be born from infidelity on your ex\u2019s and sister\u2019s part. Not going to lie, if I knew you and knew this situation I wouldn\u2019t think you wrong, but I would tell you ALL the horror stories surrounding my family and foster care and let you know full well what was in store for your innocent nibling.", "NTA, take in the child and then put it up for adoption.", "I think people get confused about what \"be the bigger person!\" really means? It doesn't imply, \"Deny yourself and prove your worth because other people are watching us and we don't want other people to know what a hot mess we've been through!\"", "OP - YTA - you are a selfish asshat who would rather hold a grudge than help a child. \n\n...hold a grudge....rather than help a child\n\nThe child of two people OP once loved. If you aren't going to help your nibling, then you need to cut your parents out of your life because they probably won't forgive you and I wouldn't either if I were they.", "Then the grandparents can maintain a relationship even  if they don't have custodial care. Pushing OP to take on the child's care puts them firmly in AH territory.", "Holy shit. I can\u2019t believe this sub is downvoting people who sympathize for the child.", "Her hatred of the child's parents is completely justified. Honestly for your sister and boyfriend to have jumped into an affair behind your back is horrible. Obviously it's a hurtful thing but the fact that your sister also took part in it just makes it worse. Why would OP want to be reminded of that by taking in the child?  It's not being selfish but protecting their own well being.", "Taking on the responsibility of a child you have never met and who is the reminder of the betrayal by two people you once loved does not sound like the way to healing.", "I'm sure that was their last ditch attempt and I understand what they're trying to do, but from your point of view it's just impossible.\n\nNTA, but it's sad.", "Tbf a **ShitLoad** of people out there have children just to have the damn \"Instagram baby\" so while yeah it's a horrible fuckin reason to have a kid, there are plenty of vapid dickchutes out there that do", "Yeah because those traits are specific only to people of a certain age, what a nonsense take, there are good people and bad people of every generation. Of course there is nobody that is all about appearances with zero substance in this age of social media. We get it you hate you parents, grow up.", "I agree, I think the grandparents are exaggerating on 4 placements already. \n\nIf that's true though I could see potential behavioral issues from a kid whose parents created an unstable home environment with constant fighting", "which makes what your sister did even worse.  Keep your boundaries you do not need to do this and shouldn't have to. That child is not your family, your sister made that choice for you, thus isn't about punishing a child it's about not setting yourself on fire to keep that child warm.", "Because the child is not responsible for the sins of the parents, who are dead.  OP has moved on and built a new life with a new partner, I bet she is much happier in her current situation than she would have been with her ex.  Why can't she see the child as their own person, as a vulnerable child, who needs the love and support of family? OP is family.   Her sister and ex have no say in how she raises this child, which she can do with the love, kindness, and loyalty they didn't show her.  I think she is reaching out to Reddit because there is a part of her that knows she can do this and it might be very healing for her.  She never met the child, who is a stranger to her, I think she can see raising the child as a clean slate, instead of a constant reminder of an old betrayal.  Maybe I'm projecting because that's what I would do.", "I was the one with the infant. Only two families wanted to adopt a mixed infant.", "That's fair for your perspective but I don't think most people see it that way. I know if it were to happen to me I would understand the child has no fault here. But I don't want a reminder of the betrayal every day looking at me it would seem like some sick sense of punishment. You seem to be very understanding and maybe too forgiving. Even if you are going through healing to try and get past the trauma whatever it may be to constantly be reminded of that is not conducive to a healthy mental state. But why is it OPs responsibility to pick up the pieces? She had to pick herself up and move on after the affair and now she is expected to be the bigger person and raise the affair child? Why does she have to keep dealing with the repercussions of her sister and ex's decisions? At what point does it end. Now she is choosing herself and her parents are trying to manipulate her? That's not right\n It sucks whats happening to the child I think the parents should be focusing their efforts on the fathers family to take in the child vs OP.", "Me and my brothers all have it better then our parents did and I know many with a similar situation. Seem to me that young people are ungrateful for the world they were given and want everything handed to them.", "When we adopted our son, we were the only waiting couple who would accept a mixed race or fully Black baby. That was over 17 years ago. It's gotten somewhat better now, but Black babies are still harder to place, even privately.", "So you're cool with raising your GFs APs child then?", "Because they've burnt all the bridges and don't have people like that", "I don\u2019t blame them, honestly. I\u2019m a social worker and I have seen what the foster system does to kids. Knowing your grandchild is going into the system and being unable to adopt her yourself is heartbreaking. I would be frantically, desperately trying to convince OP too. It isn\u2019t OP\u2019s responsibility, exactly. But the grandparents are literally trying to save their grandchild from a lifetime of trauma. She\u2019ll be at the whim of foster families and the caprices of the system. She\u2019ll be ripped from loving homes and put into shitty ones. She\u2019ll never make friends because she won\u2019t be on schools long enough to meet anyone.  Her possessions will all fit into a garbage bag or if she\u2019s lucky, a duffel bag. She\u2019ll learn to hoard food in case her foster parents don\u2019t feed her. She won\u2019t get gifts at Christmas, new clothes, a\ncake on her birthday. Chances are high she will be abused, physically or sexually, either at the hands of her foster parents or foster siblings. She will never experience attachment with a caregiver without knowing it could be ripped away at any moment. My heart aches for this little girl. She hasn\u2019t just lost her mum and dad- she\u2019s lost her whole family, her childhood and her whole future.", "And so their child should suffer for this, is that what you're saying?", "It could be that the parents WERE the trusted guardians, and the state disagreed. I think something is up with what OPs parents are telling them, but to speak to your point, it could be that the state stepped in and said NO.", "\"Liked her sister\"? He f\\*cked her sister and got her pregnant while engaged to OP. \n\nEvery single person posting this kind of BS that she is a horrible human being for not wanting to take in her ex fiance's affair baby and she should be forced to parent is just as bad as those so called pro-life people suggesting women should be forced to bear children.", "Biological family has rights but family friends do not. They would need to go through the system and it would be very difficult to be approved to adopt, even if they found someone. The system is not friendly to adopters, and not designed to facilitate adoptions.", "Lol right!", "Well the kid is already suffering right now \nIt has family that doesnt want him", "I think they meant the kids mother, OPs sister", "More likely behavioural issues would stem from both parents having just died and being put in a foster home. You\u2019re missing the forest for the trees.", "I don't know exactly where OP is, but in some cases, the house can only have so many kids, depending on the age. So while a foster home might be allowed to have 5 tweens/teens, they might only be allowed to have 3 under 8, and only 2 of those could be toddlers or infants. Therefore, it's harder to find space for younger children.", "What part of *SHE* *DOES* *NOT* *WANT* *TO* *RAISE* *THIS* *CHILD !!!!!!!!!!!* do people around here not get?

OP was estranged and it is not said if they made any effort to support OP, to make things right or anything like that.

That makes them assholes in my book.", "She's an asshole, too!

A child should not have to be forced into a home where they will not be wanted or loved and you shouldn't be forced to become a parent you have no intention of being.\n\n Personally i couldn't imagine leaving a kid in the system that was family no matter my relationship with their parents but even id second guess it if it involved an ex fiance. Too much", "Oh come on, I've seen kids in permanent placement with a Grandmother who was incapable of walking and was easily 400 pounds.

We often struggle to emotionally regulate ourselves. We often make mistakes when in pain and under pressure. These are 2 ppl that lost their young daughter and their grandchild has been tossed to literal strangers at the scariest and most awful time of their young life. They are in pain. They are desperate. This is the definition of CRISIS. They quite reasonably want this child to be with family at this time. So, if you understand real life as you say you do, then you understand that They are in no way assholes. They are 2 ppl who are living their worst experience.
