{"id": 15565, "submission_id": "12xeimq", "title": "AITA for shutting down my parents by saying I won't raise their grandchild just to look good to others?", "selftext": "So I (27f) was estranged from my deceased sister for five years after she had an affair with my fianc\u00e9 that not only I found out about, but resulted in a pregnancy. I cut the two of them out of my life and declared they were dead to me. They had a child who is now 4 but maybe close to 5 now, I'm not sure. I have never met the child. I never wanted to meet the child or be in their life. My parents knew their grandchild and supported the child while my sister and ex were alive. They were on and off after I left him. I heard from friends that their breakups were quite explosive. When they died in a car accident recently people were shocked, but also kind of not, because a lot of people assumed they were arguing and didn't focus on the road. Their child went into foster care. My parents tried to take them but were denied on the grounds of health and mobility. The child's paternal relatives did not want to take the child, no surprises there though, and so my parents turned to me.\n\nI am now engaged again, to Luke, and we bought our forever home last year. We are stable and happy and my parents believe I/we should take their grandchild. I told them I would not be a good fit to raise the child and I was sorry, but that was the end of the discussion as far as I'm concerned. Luke told them he was with me on that. My parents went behind my back to try and talk him into it but he told me and I told them to stop. They begged me again to reconsider and said imagine how nice it would be to know my nibling, to get to be there, to have a child who is part of our family kept in our family and raised lovingly around people who want the best for them. I told them that is not a job for me and to let it go. A few days went by and I thought they might have let it drop. Then they call and tell me to think about how good it will look, for me, the betrayed sister and ex-fianc\u00e9e to have enough love and compassion to raise the child that was conceived out of said betrayal and love them and be the best mom to that child who could exist. They said people would think I'm a saint and would always think of me as an incredible person. I told them I am no saint, I do not want to be a saint, I don't need to be seen as some incredible, amazing person and I am not going to raise their grandchild just to look good to other people and they need to stop asking me to.\n\nThey told me I was heartless and asked how I could not care at all about a child who is my own flesh and blood who has been tossed around the system in just a few weeks, because according to them the child has been in 4 homes already. They said I should not be able to turn my back on family like this and I should have more compassion for them, who were told by CPS they will not be allowed to raise their grandchild.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682340316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xeimq/aita_for_shutting_down_my_parents_by_saying_i/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be insulted by the fact that they think you should do it to look good.", "NTA\n\nAnd OMG that they even suggested what others might think we a possible motivation!!!\n\nI understand their request, I understand that they wish they could keep him in the family, but they need to respect your answer.\n\nGiven the circumstances of your sister and your fiance betraying you, it's not at all unreasonable that you do not wish to become parents to their son.\n\nYou are not obliged to even of others though you ought.\n\nI know some will mention that the kid is innocent and yes he is, but you are also entitled to protect your mental well-being by choosing not to become his parent.", "Apologies as I don't mean to be unsympathetic but wow. This is a movie script. \n\nAnyways. NTA", "NTA at all. Look, I know the system is not good for the kids, but that is an unfortunately result of the accident that you cannot change because you have a life to live and also you don\u2019t have any bond with the kids that represent one of the most horrible chapters of your life.", "Nta\n\nTell them you care the same amount as your sister who betrayed her own flesh and blood by fucking you over. The way your sister turned her back on you by cheating with your then-partner.", "NTA\n\nI can't imagine a betrayed ex to be a good step mother for an orphaned child. Least when the person went NC with family of that betrayal. Sounds more like the ideal setup for an evil step mother...", "NTA. Your parents are clearly trying to stay in the life of a child they have bonded over, but that\u2019s not on you. And it\u2019s not fair to the child to be raised by someone who\u2019s going to hate it.", "NTA. Raising a child, even a relation, is no small obligation. You need to be 100% on board or you and the child will suffer. And doing it to \u201clook good\u201d is the absolute wrong motivation. \n\nYou told your parents \u201cno.\u201d As tough as a situation as this is, the need to accept this. You have your own history with this situation, and this needs to be honored.", "NTA big time and your parents most definitely are. More than family that child is the sole face of the uttermost pain, disrespect, betrayal and contempt you suffered from someone who is supposed to be your family. So you had every right to turn your back to your so called sister and whatever happens is not up to you to fix. Also when you have your own kids, the sisters kid would be just someone who is there and I very much doubt if you or your fiancee would be able to love or even be impartial towards him/ her. What your parents are doing to you is showing disrespect and you have every right to want a life of your own as its not who did anything wrong but is still being forced to have to deal with an issue that's not yours. Irrespective of how many down vote I might get, I am with you on this one as its not your child and not your problem. For once, live the life you deserve and its time you told your parents to get lost. Good that your fiancees is with you on this one.", "NTA - I could write paragraphs about this but there\u2019s no point really. Live your own life, if your parents really cared this much about the upbringing of their grandchild they would do it themselves rather than continuously pester their own daughter to do so (I don\u2019t know the grandparents\u2019 capability, this is an assumption). \n\nAs I get older I realise more and more that I care so little about what others think of me, the times when I cared about what other people thought I was always at my lowest with nothing going for me. As soon as I don\u2019t care about any of that crap, everything just starts to fall into place.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d always check in on the child and make sure they\u2019re doing alright, but that\u2019s as far as I\u2019d go with it. You have no obligation to this", "NTA. It's sad for the child, but would you even be able to raise the child without being constantly reminded of the betrayal and ultimately \"take that out\" on the child? You've done nothing wrong, you know it won't be a good fit, and while it's a shame they aren't in a position to raise the child - I think you are making the correct decision.", "NTA. Taking on a child is a huge responsibility, and whilst it\u2019s incredibly sad that no one will be able to raise the child, it doesn\u2019t make it your responsibility.", "NTA.", "NTA. Every child deserves love. But this child will always remind you of a great deal of pain, and because of that you would not be a good fit to raise this child. If you did, it would be very easy to take your valid resentment out on the kid. And that kid still doesn't deserve that. The foster system isn't great but they're better equipped to love this child than you.", "NTA. \n\nThe child *is not your flesh and blood*.  \nThe child is *theirs*.\n\nI'm sorry for the grief they're putting you through.", "NTA. Your sister and ex failed their child by not making a will to determine who would take their child in the event of their passing. They had 4 years to do this and didn\u2019t. You\u2019re absolutely right not to take on a child that you know you can\u2019t provide emotionally for. An unwanted child is well aware they are unwanted", "NTA - I feel bad for the kid but if you don\u2019t want a kid you don\u2019t have to have one, also, if you don\u2019t want the kid then you\u2019re definitely not a \u201cgood fit\u201d, it would likely not be good for you or the kid", "NTA, but I do see the reasoning from your parents, they\u2019re just not approaching it the right way. No one should be forced to have a child when they don\u2019t want a child, you\u2019re 100% NTA.\n\nThe foster care system is so broken. I see so many kids in the system, and having a relative or friend care for them is so much more beneficial then having a random person. Your parents are suffering from the mistakes of your sister and the sucky part is, if the kiddo does go into the system and get adopted, the chances of your parents having a relationship with the child are slim (unless they get an AMAZING worker and foster care family that will coordinate visits throughout the child\u2019s life). Are there any family friends that would take the child? In my state, kiddos can be placed in kinship with friends of the family as long as they pass a home-study and are physically fit!", "NTA. Kids are a huge responsibility and considering your past with the childs parents, does not sound like it will be the best environment for the child (no offense). Surprised they denied your parents (unless they are in absolutely terrible shape). Hoping for the best for that poor baby.", "NTA. Would it look good? Of course it would. But it's flat-out cruel to expect someone to raise a symbol of such a fundamental and terrible personal betrayal, and to try and guilt you into doing so is abusive. Your parents are the heartless ones.", "NTA. I feel for your parents and their grandkid.  I can understand why they came up with the idea (bad as it is), and it was within normal bounds for them to ask you....ONCE. You said (quite understandably \"NO.\"  They seriously need to drop it. And leave it dropped. Stick to your guns, this is not your responsibility, no matter what your parents might want you to believe.", "NTA\u2014 you don\u2019t have a relationship with this child, you chose not to have one with them for the last 4 or 5 years, for your own very justifiable reasons. \n\nYou aren\u2019t obligated to raise them now because their parents have passed away. Raising a child is not about \u201clooking good\u201d I think your parents got it all wrong there. They are also trying to manipulate you into doing something which is a huge responsibility.", "NTA. \nYou have a perfectly valid reason to not raise this child. Beyond the betrayal, raising a child is an incredibly difficult thing to take on. Your parents seem more concerned with keeping up appearances.", "NTA! Nobody should be forced to raise somebody else's child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They lost a daughter and now they are facing losing a grandchild, their last part of her. This isn't your problem if you can't be a support for the kid based on how she came into the world.

Then explain that you are not willing to do so, that you are not a suitable placement, and all the reasons why you aren't a good placement.

So a friend gave a letter that they will drive if the kid needs to go to appointments etc and will help in communication. That\u2019s what I meant to ask if you could help in any way. Anyways NTA. It\u2019s not good for you or the kid for you to adopt him. Hope he finds a loving family.", "I guess? I think they care more about their grandchild than insulting me, which okay, but I have always marched to the beat of my own drum and never was someone to hyper focus on what others think.", "They have had one visit with the child so far. But I know it's hard for them because the child has been bounced around.", "I wonder why a child this young is having so many placements, do they have behavioral issues, etc.or they are trying to get them into a possible adoptive placement. Anyways, it's your parents problem now. Hopefully, they can remain involved and advocate for the best placement.", "Sadly, wouldn't be shocked at behavioral issues.  To the extent the bio parents had a genetic predisposition to any behaviors... it doesn't sound like the kid would have won the genetic lottery there.  And the home life did not sound stable and nurturing, not with frequent explosive breakups.\n\nPlacing the child with someone who would resent them (ie. OP) could very well be worse than placing them with someone who was indifferent to them.", "Probably a push in that regard. This kid needs stable, loving placement fast. As a former CPS worker, this would be a nightmare of a case."]}
