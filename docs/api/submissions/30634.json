Now that I have my license, it really feels good to finally be able to drive without having to have someone else go with me and critique my driving. For the most part this hasn\u2019t been a problem, but my mom tends to freak out whenever she\u2019s a passenger in anyone\u2019s car (not just with me). \n\nYesterday, Mom had to take her car for service and asked if I could pick her up from the dealership so she wouldn't have to take the shuttle. I reluctantly said yes. As we were driving, Mom kept telling me that I was drifting too far to the right. This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s brought this up, however, the fact that no one else has said anything about it makes me feel like this is an issue with my mom, not my driving. Also my car has sensors that let you know if you're too close to another car, and they were not going off.\n\nWe were driving down a street with parking spaces on the side of the road. My mom thought I was driving too close to them and was worried I was going to hit one of the parked cars. She kept telling me to move to the left and was getting increasingly frantic. When I didn\u2019t move, she PUSHED THE STEERING WHEEL, which caused me to swerve into the next lane and caused me to almost hit the car next to me (at that point, the sensors went off).\n\nThis of course startled the hell out of me. There was an empty parking spot at the side of the road, so I pulled into it and put my flashers on. I then yelled at my mom, asking what the fuck she was thinking by pushing the steering wheel like that, as she nearly caused me to crash! She said that I wouldn't have almost crashed if I made more effort not to swerve.\n\nShe kept yelling, and I told her that I didn't want to hear it, and to get the fuck out of my car, and take an Uber the rest of the way home! This made her stop yelling. She looked at me for several seconds, then said a meek \"Sorry.\" This really pissed me off. At this point, she became all sweet, and was like \"It's okay, calm down, don't drive right now, you're too riled up, maybe I can drive the rest of the way home,\" etc. This annoyed me but eventually I did calm down.\n\nI told her that I'll take her the rest of the way home, but to please get in the back seat. She seemed annoyed by this request, but I told her that this was my car (which it is, it's in my name), and these are my conditions for being a passenger in it. I don't think she liked my tone, but I wasn\u2019t going to cave simply because she's my mom, and she thinks that she can still treat me like I'm 12 years old. But now I'm feeling guilty.\n\nI love my mom, and overall we have a good relationship. I\u2019m grateful that my parents have continued to let me live with them while I attend college. The fact that she seemed annoyed when made her move to the back seat made me think that I should've just shut up and continued driving with her in the front seat, and to do everything I could to make sure she wouldn't continue to freak out.", "created_utc": 1699510208, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17r6l61/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_after_she_pushed_the/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I yelled at her and used some language I'm not proud of, then, after I calmed down, asked her to please move to the back seat if she wanted to continue driving with me. She seemed annoyed by this request, but nonetheless moved to the back. I feel like I should've just kept my mouth shut and continued driving, and made more effort to ensure she wouldn't continue freaking out.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She almost caused a car crash. You NEVER EVER EVER physically interfere with a driver unless there is absolutely no other way to avoid an actual crash. You were freaked out and on an adrenaline high right after, because you almost got into a car crash. Of course you're going to yell.", "NTA. Don't drive your mom anymore. She is not safe to have as a passenger if she would do something like that.\n\nBeing on the passenger side also makes that side seem closer, if someone is used to being the driver. So she's probably actually wrong about your position in the lane, too.", "Nta\n\nA passenger touching the steering wheel (without good reason such as a driver undergoing some sort of medical crisis) is attempted murder/suicide.\n\nIt's so unbelievably stupid that I have no words.\n\nYour mother is an asshole.\n\nNever allow her to sit in the front in your car. I mean it never.", "NTA.  All through the story I was shouting, \u201cMAKE HER GET IN THE BACK\u201d!", "NTA. Yeah, I decided years ago I cannot drive with my sister in the passenger seat. You can't drive safely with someone else freaking out right next to you. Now i just give her my keys. If someone actively endangered me by pushing my steering wheel and then \"kindly\" offered to drive, like your mom? Fuck off, get out of my car or get in the back seat and shut TF up.", "NTA. I actually think you handled this quite well. You pulled over, vented, and made adjustments to prevent her from doing it again. You might feel guilty for being so angry, but your mom deserved every bit of that anger. What she did was ridiculously dangerous.\n\nLeave it alone and move on.", "NTA your mum is dangerous and you shouldn\u2019t let her in the car again. I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019d let her sit in the back to be honest and she could reach for the hand break", "\nNTA. It sounds like your mom might be a tad neurotic. It\u2019s probably best you tell her you\u2019re sorry for yelling but you expect her to apologize for touching the wheel. That\u2019s not acceptable no matter who\u2019s driving. \n\nPs. My grandma drives to the right of the road. They call it riding the fog line around here. Whenever I\u2019m in the passenger seat it seems like we\u2019re gonna hit stuff and we never do. I\u2019ll occasionally be like \u201cwoah woah\u201d but I\u2019d NEVER touch the steering wheel lol", "As soon as I read the headline, I was thinking that she needs to sit in the back of the car, whenever she rides with you\u2026 You are NTA.

She needs to know what she did is absolutely not ok and is wildly dangerous. Tell her if she ever rides with you again it will be in the back seat only.", "NTA\n\nWhat on EARTH was your mum thinking!", "NTA. Mom was totally out of line and could have caused a major accident.", "NTA, for u and ur mother's safety please do not let her be in the passenger seat again, that could've gone so, much worse than it did", "What you did had to happen in order for you to be able to drive safely.  Obviously, grabbing or pushing or in any way touching the steering while while someone else is driving is very unsafe. \n\nDon't even think about driving your mom in the front seat again.  Not for a very long time.\n\nNTA", "Only thing I would have done is followed through with the Uber demand. She made that bed for herself, let her lay in it. NTA.", "NTA As a piece of advice parents seem to behave better sat behind the driver, especially when they are not used to being the passenger. I found this out with my dad who would constantly complain that the car was in the wrong place in the road, in reality he was rarely a passenger and not used to seeing it from that side. When he was behind the driver he never had this complaint. He was also much better behaved when he could not see things like what gear we were in and had to go on how the car felt/sounded instead.", "My Mom loves being driven around and is fine with me doing so when we\u2019re in Canada. She got a car in the caribbean and was so excited for me to drive her around there despite me never driving a car where the driver was on the right and the lanes reversed. This woman screamed more than once and I had to shut her down, and she was super pissed.  For both of our safety, she was relegated to the backseat. The next time I went to the Caribbean I was by myself, and got used to the roads quite quickly. When she ended up coming down to join me, it was all sunshine and roses after that. We still talk about her screaming in the car though. NTA", "NTA. At all. How is your relationship with your father? If it\u2019s good, I would tell him as quickly as you can. Get your info to him first before she does.", "NTA and what your mother did was incredibly stupid and dangerous. From now on either avoid giving her rides or she ALWAYS has to ride in the back.", "Hard agree here. OP, moving her to the back was a good stop-gap for this ride (although your instinct to have her get out and find her own way home was pretty bad-ass), but it\u2019s not a good idea long term. As u/Tangerine_Bouquet says, she\u2019s just not safe to have as a passenger. Full stop. From the backseat she can still grab you, yell out unpredictably, and so forth. She is a danger, and that\u2019s all there is to it. Her interference could kill or maim you, kill or maim her, and / or kill or maim innocent bystanders. Those are consequences you absolutely don\u2019t want to have to live with. \n\nFWIW, her abrupt change in tone when she realized she might have to get out, her attempt to blame you for the high risk situation *she 100% caused*, and her passive aggressive \u201ccalm down\u201d statements towards the end point to her behavior being at least partially intentional rather than instinctive. It doesn\u2019t really matter though, from a safety perspective. However, it may help you to consider this piece of wisdom I saw somewhere else recently: some people will do everything in their power to continue seeing you as the person you were when they had the most control over you. Your mom may be intent on believing you are still as you were at 12 years old (or whatever age it is when she felt strongest and most important / needed) because acknowledging you are an adult capable of doing her favors, operating a motor vehicle independently, etc, threatens her own sense of self. This is sad, but recognizing this may allow you to get some distance from her behavior - it\u2019s all about her, not really about you.", ">Don't drive your mom anymore.\n\nThis.  She's made it her mission to find problems with your driving and is going to continue to conjure them from nothing.  She's not going to be able to stop, and she's shown that she's willing to take her fiction so far that she actually grabs the wheel.  She can find other rides from now on with people she's not so invested in criticizing.", "Getting one of those cabbie cages can prevent her from doing something pants on head stupid..."]}
