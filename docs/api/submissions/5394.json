Most people assume it's a ceremonial role and that most kids only have two godparents,  not six.", "YTA. The amount of godparents is irrelevant (although silly). I think it\u2019s a matter of you lacking the emotional maturity to understand everybody is busy. I go for months without seeing some of my friends. It doesn\u2019t cheapen our relationship nor our commitment to being there when it counts. 2 businesses? That\u2019s a lot. I have juggled 2 jobs and 2 volunteer commitments and barely had time for my partner. I can\u2019t imagine having 2 businesses. Cut them slack. They also deserve to have fun.

What was the intention of making 6 people God parents? \n\nDid you think your friends who are in the middle of their own family planning were going to drop everything and come take care of your son for you for a break?\n\nYour husband losing his license has nothing to do with your friends.", "Three sets of godparents is an unusually large number, but OK.\n\nGenerally speaking, godparents should take an interest in the spiritual development of their godchild. Your son is 8 months old - he can't talk yet. Do they attend the same church as you?\n\nSounds like YTA, because you seem to have a bunch of extra random expectations of them that you never made clear.", "SIX godparents ?? Sorry, that\u2019s silly. Also, if you want to see them, why can\u2019t you drive there? Why is baby daddy unable to keep a license? Your friends are very busy and have their own lives. You should have outlined expectations as many times godparents are a \u201cin name only\u201d thing.", "YTA - first of all the only official reasons for picking God parents was 1. To have a set of adults to help with religious tutoring and 2. In the event of you and your husband's untimely death they would be willing to foster the child(ren). Society has turned it into some kind of cute \"honor\" to get the title. In the past  it was carefully considered and not granted to multiple sets of \"God Parents\". Since you obviously don't understand why this title us given out, you also don't seem to understand giving someone this title doesn't obligate them to do any more than the 2 points I made earlier. If you did not pick them for those reasons then you made a mistake. From your post it would appear you had no idea why you chose them. Maybe you should rethink who and why your child's God parents are.", "YTA. You didn't set clear expectations for what you wanted their role to be. \"Be active in our lives\" is NOT clear. You saw them six months ago; lots of friends only see each other every six months. Your friends are busy with work and being newlyweds and now they're pregnant as well -- they have a lot going on, you couldn't extend them a little bit of grace and flexibility? \n\n\"Come to our house and see our baby\" is a terrible thing to ask of a friend. Nobody wants to just come over and look at an 8 month old baby. Do you genuinely want to see your friends and hang out with them, or do you just want them to do something for your child? Have you invited them over for lunch or dinner or a game night or anything to have adult conversation with them since you had your baby? Or do you just keep asking them to come see the baby? \n\nThe way you keep supportive adults in your child's life is to keep people as your friends. Your friends will come around and hang out with you and your child will get to know them through you. Godparents don't just go look at the baby and start forming a relationship with them separate from you. If you haven't been making an effort to genuinely be friends with these people, of course they're not going to want to just come see your baby.", "YTA -  Within 9 months, your relationship went from asking them to be god parents to unfriending them on Facebook.  The unfriending is dramatic and thus makes YTA. \n\nPlus, they spent the first few months of your child\u2019s life planning their wedding and it sounds like you expect them to come to your house and cannot meet them anywhere else.

I think you\u2019ve blown this whole situation of our proportion. So what if the kids godparents aren\u2019t present in his life. Of course you want your son to get to know your friends and family but you\u2019re getting lost in the titles and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it.

Some people view it purely as a ceremonial, honor title and then some people expect more spiritual involvement. 3 sets of godparents? What's the thought process on that?\n\nI think it's personally reasonable the wife doesn't want to be around smokers. And is your expectation of then spending time with your son babysitting? How much personal time do they need with your baby?\n\nAsk them to step down if you can find someone else to find your undefined rules, but I don't think they were wrong for not doing what in your mind you envisioned. It's weird to completely end a friendship over them being busy and you not being the #1 priority, but it's not their loss.", "YTA. Your posting history is interesting to say the least. However IMHO having 6 godparents cheapens the role and what it stands for. First and foremost, traditionally a godparent is a person who has pledged to help with the upbringing of a child, especially in a religious way. Secondly, they are to be another adult role model a child can look up to as they grow; they are not co-parents which is what you're making it seem you want. \n\nThey have told you their reasons as to why they're not involved in your child's life. They're running 2 business in addition to their hobbies; you and your child are not their to priority. You come across as entitled and smothering.", "Maybe not an AH, but I don\u2019t think you have an accurate understanding of the role of a modern god-parent.", "YTA - First of all, it\u2019s your partner\u2019s fault he lost his license and that your family has this inconvenience in your lives. Just because he was reckless doesn\u2019t mean someone else has to come see you and your kid. Secondly, you clearly don\u2019t understand boundaries because that is what the godmother is setting up. It\u2019s absolutely reasonable to not want to be around smokers (even if she wasn\u2019t pregnant). Just because he won\u2019t smoke at their house doesn\u2019t mean the smell won\u2019t carry over in his clothes, breath, etc. which to a pregnant woman can be extremely uncomfortable with a heightened sense of smell. Lastly, it\u2019s ridiculous to have three sets of Godparents and you have to understand they all have their own life, own jobs, own hobbies, and own families!! Ya it sucks your kid doesn\u2019t have more family/friends around like you did growing up, but you cannot force anyone to come around. It\u2019s so entitled to feel that way, let people live their own lives. I don\u2019t think you understand what Godparents are even meant to be used for. They\u2019re not people who are obligated to spend time with your child.", "What did you expect a god parent to be? As far as I know it\u2019s basically an honorary title and the person participated in the baptismal ceremony and agrees to help the baby in their path to god. \n\nIf you had additional expectations beyond the half hour required of them at the ceremony you should have discussed with them, because your expectations seem out of line. \n\nYTA", "YTA the world does not revolve around your child. Also the title of godparents really doesn\u2019t mean anything, make one or hundred people there god parent.

Oh jeeeezus I'm going to make it a Facebook post. Thanks for this.", "YTA. \n\nYou had a child 8 months ago, and in that time these godparents got married and got pregnant, so it's not like they have had a ton of free time. How much were you really expecting them to visit? The first few months they shouldn't have really been around the baby that much/you are getting used to being a new mom, they had a wedding to plan and attend and enjoy, and now she is pregnant. They sound legit busy. \n\nYour partner smokes and you have a child, and rightly this woman doesn't want to be around a smoker. \n\nYour partner lost his license- you refuse to say why in the comments- and you expect others to make an effort to visit when you don't make the same effort. \n\nAnd sure, you can have some expectations of godparents, but you should clearly communicate what those expectations are, because it isn't the same in every family. In my family it was very ceremonial or was about having a clear relative who would take the child if something happened to the parents. You picked 3 sets, which means what exactly? Honestly it does feel, given how you wrote this story, that you wanted to force a bunch of people to be around you when you want and give your kid stuff, so you tripled up, which actually makes it seem like the role doesn't matter at all. \n\nAnd mostly, clearly they don't want to really be friends with you. Instead of just giving them space at a busy time, you unfriended them, creating social media drama. You don't write about you wanting to be there for your now pregnant friend or make any effort at all, and you and your partner seem like real charmers with the losing of licenses, inability to drive, and smoking around children.", "YTA- god parents are not guardians, they don't become responsible for your child if you die.

Here\u2019s what it breaks down to:\n\n1. Your expectations for godparents was not clear. \n\n2. Your expectations for godparents are VASTLY different than most peoples. \n\n3. Your partner lost his license due to bad choices. You do not have your license due to a series of excuses (post-abusive relationship). So these people HAVE to come to you. An unreasonable expectation. \n\n4. Your partner is a smoker, a smell that does not go away even with spray and clean clothes. Any person, particularly a pregnant person, had the right to refuse to be around a smoker. \n\nIn short, the world does not revolve around you and your child and your family\u2019s choices.", "YTA - but that's only because I come from a place where godparents are extremelly important and is advised they see each other as little as possible to avoid possible feuds.

It's not like they're getting paid or putting it on their resume. Would they even notice if you stop involving them in your vision of godparent activities? Seems like you could either find a new third set of godparents or just go with the other two sets you have in place.\n\nNow time for honest introspection. Is there *any* truth to what they are saying? Did you, even in your most secret heart, have some financial expectations that motivated you to include them as your child's godparents? Who are the other two sets and what level of interaction/financial contribution do those two sets give?", "YTA\n\nIn this day and age godparent is just a title.  Also not everyone likes babies.

Primary purpose of god parents is to decide who would be their parents if you were to go be with god.  Thus the word god and parents.

Even if your partner didn\u2019t smoke while they\u2019re there, that smell is on your clothes and your hair and your furniture (yes from the smell of clothes to sitting on furniture it will transfer).   Why would you expect a friend to put herself through nausea when you\u2019re not willing to understand how hard it is?\n\nThe unfriending on Facebook is just super immature of you.

Even though in my mind it is an absolute given that I would take them if anything happened to my sister and BIL, she still insisted we sit down and have a full discussion about it before she would formalize the godparent role. They aren\u2019t religious people, so the whole role of spiritual guidance instead is \u201chelp me make sure they don\u2019t turn into assholes\u201d, but that was discussed as well. \n\nYou can\u2019t have expectations of someone without having discussed it with more detail than just \u201chey, wanna join my kid\u2019s army of godparents?\u201d I get that the role of a godparent can be changed based on the individuals, but you can\u2019t expect people to know what the role entails if you change it from the standard and aren\u2019t clear on what it involves. \n\nYou also have to realize that these people have lives beyond your child, and just because he is the most important person in your life doesn\u2019t mean everyone feels that way.

They are going to have a child soon, which is a big incentive to getting together - so the kids can play with each other. It will also change their lives significantly as far as hobbies and work go, because their kid is going to need to be worked into the schedule. They are probably trying to fit more in than normal now, knowing that big change is coming. \n\nIf you want them in your life, give them time to sow the last of their oats and settle in with their new baby.

OP has unrealistic expectations for Godparents.  It's an honorary thing.  Not a legal thing.

Godparents don't need to do more than show up for birthdays and holidays and even that is a privilege not a requirement. If they do more, that's great.  But they don't have to anymore than any other relative or family friend. The only real requirement is the actual baptism if the parents are religious.\n\nThe friend's suck because they didn't need to go around and spread nasty messages to friends and family.  That is always unnecessary.  OP was with her right to unfriend them if they didn't meet her unrealistic expectations.  Or even the realistic ones. Wanting a Godparents involved is not unrealistic.  Wanting then heavily involved might be. To trash OP to the point people are being nasty, is just not it.  Cut people out, let others figure out if they want to be around those people.

My partner,  m30, sons dad, lost his licence so we where not able to just up and go anywhere and see people.\n\nI had asked them around more then once and was always told no and giving a reason, the reason was always \"busy racing\" they where across the street from us.\n\nNow the woman is pregnant and started using the reason \"smokers make me sick\". Partner is a smokers but even said if they where to come qround he would not smoke when they are here.\n\nBefore finding out She was pregnant we had asked them to step down as God parents as they made no effort at all to see our son.\n\nAfter this I gave up and un friended them on Facebook, this led them to DM friends and family members, then when I asked them to stop I was sworn at by the guy and the woman got nasty, they didn't understand why I un friended even thou I explained why.\n\nThey are now going around saying stuff about me that isn't true. That we didn't asked them to be the God parents and that we forced them cus they have money\n\nNote, they live 20min out of town, are in town everyday and drive pass our house everyday .\n\nSo aita for wanting my sons God parents to be apart of his life?\n\nTLDI\nGod parents didn't put any effort in to see my son, where asked to step down as God parents and now are being nasty\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And not wanting to be around a smoker - even if he won't smoke in their presence. The smell of smoke lingers like crazy. I'm very sensitive it and it was awful when I was pregnant.\n\nAlso, six godparents is excessive, especially since they're generally meant to be for religious/spiritual mentorship in various faiths. I understand other cultures it may be different but truthfully, you seem to give the vibe that you wanted the godparents to be around constantly.\n\nYou're well within your rights to ask them to step down, but seems like you went a bit nuclear with unfriending them etc and I feel there has to be a lot more to this.", "YTA. \n\nIt sounds like you have some poor judgement. You said that these friends never made the effort even before you got pregnant, they never came to see you or put any effort in, so why make them God parents at all? You knew what they were like, according to your comments here.\n\nYou say you \"made it clear\" what you wanted from your massive party of godparents but the most I can see you saying to them was \"have an impact in our lives\", which is in no way clear. You didn't tell them you want them to visit you on a regular basis. You didn't tell them you expect God parents to \"want to be around their godchild\". \n\nYou also don't loose your license for going a little over the limit so either there's a lot morehistory here and he has been in trouble for this before (and hasn't learned his lesson) or he was going WAY over the limit / there's some other reason.  You've also had over a year since finding out you were pregnant to progress your own license as it seems you know your current partner isn't entirely reliable.\n\nThen there's the drama of blocking them, which besides being dramatic and unnecessary, wouldn't have caused issues if they weren't that involved, as they wouldn't have noticed. The fact they noticed must mean they were trying to be in touch in some way. \n\nYou seem to have very different expectations of what a God parent is to other people, and you seem to be refusing to accept that and are arguing with everyone here instead of accepting the judgement.

It doesn't matter if he smokes while they are there or not, she will still breath and smell the second hand smoke. She is allowed to decide if she wants to be around a smoker or not. That is her choice that she has ever right to make. \n\nYou come across in this post as controlling, overbearing, unreasonable and honestly a little unhinged.

I do see my godchildren regularly.", "Thanks!", "You do realize he still smells like smoke-his clothes,hair, hands and breath right?", "Okay that\u2019s good. And how did he lose his license?", "He still smells like smoke. Still brings it in the house. So if she has a sensory issue with the smell, doing it outside probably doesn't fix the problem. \n\nAnd how is it their fault your husband was speeding? It takes a lot of speed to get your license revoked.", "Have you heard about \\[edit, whoops, it's called third hand smoke, not passive second hand\\]? The pollutants cling to the smoker, and can and will still affect your child. Unless hubs is doing a decontam shower after every cig, your kid is still being harmed.\n\nWhy not invest some of your controlling-other-people energy in a smoking cessation effort?", "\u2026they ring? To talk to your infant or you?", "They don\u2019t have to I\u2019m sorry but he\u2019s your child and your responsibility I don\u2019t get what you were honestly expecting from these people", "How did your current baby daddy lose his license? DUIs?", "what about taxis or uber?", "Being godparents is like an agreement that you will raise the kid if something happens to the parents. It\u2019s not legally binding, just a verbal agreement with the parents. I think then you\u2019re supposed to put in your will that you want your kid to go to their godparents.", "I think they\u2019re lucky you cut them out.", "What the hell is an \"official\" godparent? Is there a contract? Are they licensed by the state or some other entity? Do you and the godparents even have the same definition of what a godparent is? Were there ever any discussions of actual expectations or did you just assume they knew what it means in your mind?", "They can't all be official, how would 3 different couples all have custody of your child if you both die?", "Do you have a religious affiliation? Was your child baptized/dedicated in a church? That\u2019s what godparents are for. The people who you designate as guardians for your children in case of your death are a different category.", "Guess what\u2026 the only people who actually have your kid as priority in life its you and your husband.", "You forgot babysit /s", "Plus contribute to a college fund.", "Lmfaooooooo truth", "What made you ask this couple? Are they close friends of you or your partner?\n\nTo me, it seems like you had a big response when your son is only eight months old. You still have 17.3 years of particularly influential time, but you already ended this.", "Sure because you definitely don\u2019t seem like the kind of person who would be petty and vindictive if someone had the nerve to turn down the *great honor* of being a godparent to your precious tiny prince\u2026", "No offense, but I have lived with smokers and that just sounds like he probably smells like smoke mixed with cologne/febreeze.", "So your partner is bringing his poison into the house and around your baby?", "Sprays sometime just make it way, way worse. Then it\u2019s a combo of smoke and whatever the scent of the spray is.", "I can smell smoke on a smoker even if they have showered and changed clothes.", "You know you can\u2019t just fabreeze that stuff off right?", "Seriously? What does he spray himself with?", "Ever heard of 3rd hand smoking", "Yeah that barely does anything, though?", "Why did you partner lose his license? \n\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you want from them. Considering you gave this role to multiple sets of people it\u2019s obviously not that special of a role, why do they need to go out of their way for you all the time?", "That\u2019s fair, I\u2019ve had a friend who went 75 on a 35 backroad, got caught, got his license revoked and then got it back the next summer. Illinois is wild", "Yeah if you speed too much (like going 75 in a 45) it's considered a reckless driving in my state and if you're too much over the speed limit, they'll take your license. \nReckless driving charge is also a felony. \nProbably what happened to OPs partner.\n\n\nBut if it's their first offense usually, and they have a lawyer, they'll let the person do driving school and community service instead.", "Then couldn't you have delayed all this drama until he got it back? Then you could see if that solved your issues linking up.", "No, because OP also unfriended them on social media", "She really is!", "Not to mention the fact that when she brought up the smoking issue, she said her husband would not smoke around them.\n\nBut lets face it, anyone who is a non smoker, can walk into a smokers house, and smell the smoke that is stuck in the surfaces of everything. Even if the smoker smokes outside, the smell is still on them, and in their clothes.\n\nMy Mema was a chain smoker, and her house, car, clothes, and skin reeked of it. Even after my husband and I washed all the walls, the furniture, floors, blinds, curtains , and wiped down everything in that house, it still smelled like cigarette smoke.\n\nSo basically OP saying her husband would not smoke around the lady, was just ludacris, and not helping with the problem", "Also to be fair 8 month olds are pretty boring. \n\nMy sister is my daughters godmother and didn\u2019t really start to get involved until this past year. My daughters 5 now.", "OP really enjoys not actually answering questions.", "He's also leaving residue on the things he touches unless he immediately washes his hands after smoking.", "Exactly! My friend has asthma, and even being close to a smoker can affect her.", "There\u2019s also the smell. When my sister was pregnant and went through what she called her \u201csuperhuman phase\u201d, strong, unpleasant smells were even worse for her than normal, and she had a ramped up sense of smell on top of it. She said she woke up one morning when a skunk outside sprayed at something and couldn\u2019t stop throwing up from the smell because it was so much more overwhelming than it normally would be. Cigarette smoke is already unpleasant enough without that problem.", "Current baby daddy? His my partner, we live together and have a life together, I only have one child, just cus we are not married you think I'm going to have more then one baby daddy? Really?\n\nAnd no not DUI. He does not drink.", "In fairness, if OP lives in a rural area, there generally is limited (if any) access to public transportation or services like Uber. So I can understand that could be a consideration. \n\nDoesn't change that she's an AH. She totally is.", "I can just imagine how much more OP would complain at them after they have their baby.", "I think she means the person/people who would become the legal guardian of their child if they die. In the US, there is paperwork for it. Like, I knew my aunt and uncle would be my guardians if anything happened to my parents. But I never called them my god parents. Some people use the term interchangeably.", "Yeah there\u2019s something really weird to me about the phrase \u201casked them to step down as god parents\u201d. Like it seems so serious and official like asking an employee to turn in their keys when you fire them. Maybe I\u2019m out of the loop but I\u2019ve never heard someone talk about god parents in this way", "Death match", "It's common misconception that godparents take on the role of guardianship. Godparents are just supposed to help you live the lifestyle that the Catholic church feels you should. Unless your will explicitly states you want your child's godparents to take custody, they won't get custody of them unless there are no other options. Even if you do state you want them to have custody, other closer family members of the children may be able to overturn that and receive custody.", "I think we know the answer since she won't answer... these are their rich friends and they expected the financial windfall to be significant", "Exactly, yes. Third hand smoke (the stuff that clings to the smoker and the areas/things near the smoke) is perhaps not so bad as blowing smoke in your baby's face, but OP's level of concern over the involvement of godparents whilst ignoring her husband's direct and negative impact on the baby's health demonstrates some very interesting priorities. Wherein \"interesting\" means \"stunningly poor\"", "They never went out of their way, we always did until we couldn't.", "I\u2019d assume it\u2019s the same here - first instance is a year, then three, etc (making up timeframes). If you get too many speeding tickets in (timeframe) you have to take a mandatory driving course - a coworker knew someone who did it, but I can\u2019t remember the details.", "Yup. When my daughter was little and in Brownies, she got a new troop leader. At first, meetings were held outside because of the nice weather.  The first time they were held inside, I went to pick my daughter up and was appalled at how badly the house smelled. My daughter came out of there smelling like smoke. It was foul. We withdrew her so fast.\n\nSmokers often have very little awareness at how bad they and their possessions smell.", "I do anything I can to avoid going into smokers\u2019 homes because I inevitably get sick afterwards. Even if they don\u2019t smoke in front of me the smell of smoke is disgusting. The pregnant woman is doing the responsible thing by steering clear of OP\u2019s home.", "You can get a license now, and your partner likely can work to get his license back. Even with a DUI.", "So how did he lose it?", "Thank you. I'm not religious, so the concept of \"godfather\" is limited to me.", "Third hand smoke can cause SIDS", "You are expecting them to go out of their way because your husband is irresponsible.", "You really avoided the license question there.", "If they weren\u2019t a big part of your kid\u2019s life already why did you ask them to be godparents?", "Also, yaknow, Uber or bus...", "How funny would it be if it was for unpaid child support lol", "The was a whole movie about one though. Three even!", "Third had smoke is hands-down bad for babies (and older not-babies too!), but as far as I am aware, they're still unclear on the causation of SIDS or even whether all SIDS cases are caused by the same unknown thing, or a whole host of things that all end up looking like SIDS. So sure, yes, third hand smoke is harmful, but saying it causes SIDS is not a statement of fact, just supposition.", "You think I didn't go off at him for losing it? It has impacted a lot of things in our life cus he lost it.", "She has avoided it by every single person who as asked. Now I want to know why, too! Why is it so secretive.", "I\u2018m not defending OP, she\u2019s clearly TA but as a young mother to a newborn, it is INCREDIBLY difficult to get around. Ubers do not take babies (no working with children check, no car seat, etc). Many taxis will not take children either. Car seats are not exactly portable. Public transport is a minefield to navigate, at least in my city. I sympathise with difficulties finding transport, but it still doesn\u2019t mean that her friends don\u2019t have equally valid reasons for finding it difficult to drop round. \n\nJust because someone passes your house each day, does not mean that they have the time and/or energy to drop in, either. And wanting to avoid cigarette smoke during pregnancy is a perfectly valid reason not to come into your home environment", "In another comment op said \"for speeding going down hill\" which is bs. Honestly wouldn't be surprised with unpaid child support though.", "Frankly, I\u2019m not sure why you think your reaction to him losing it has anything to do with it. We aren\u2019t talking about that. \n\n\nWe are talking about how you expect everyone else to go out of their way because *your partner* is irresponsible. On top of that, why don\u2019t *you* drive?", "So you say that you went off on your partner for losing his license. Which means that he lost it when you were together. And you said he lost it speeding down a hill. Pretty reckless behavior in my book. But in another comment you say \u201cHe has changed alot since we got together. Even his family says that.\u201d You seem to be making a lot of excuses for both yourself and your partner.", "There's no good reason to lose one's license so I suspect it must be pretty bad and make the OP look bad.", "You don\u2019t lose your license for speeding. Unless it\u2019s some kind of stunt driving/racing charge.", "No decent judge would revoke a license just for that. OP is covering", "I said in another comment. \n\nI came from an abusive relationship of 10 years. My ex stopped me from getting my licence as that meant he would lose power over me and I would be able to leave him."]}
