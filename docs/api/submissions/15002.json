Tell your owner. Immediately. Don't wait. \nI can guarantee you that she doesn't like taking orders from a teen, and she'll go out of her way to shove you down while pulling herself up. \n\nConvo needs to go something like this:\n\nBoss, I just wanted to give you a little heads up about X. When we were closing I said they could go since they had kids waiting and all that was left for me was this task, she said \"enter what she said, then her clarification about you being around the money\". ((Add any new incidents as well, and be calm when speaking))\n\nThen tell boss \" I'm not trying to be petty, but it's clear she's already got a discriminating issue with me due to age. I want you to know about it now because it makes me uneasy that she's willing to vocally cast doubts on my character/trustworthiness already when she's only been here x many days, and doesn't know me. ((Add this next sentence only if you want)) You don't have to say anything to her yet, but if she continues I need you to support me and explain things to her\". Or alternative last sentence \" I need you to please support me and explain to her that I am trusted, I am allowed to do xyz, and while I'm not claiming to be her boss, I certainly have more on the job experience and she is definitely not my boss\"\n\nIf your boss won't stand up for you then it's time to look elsewhere because she'll go out of her way to try to subdue you into being bossed around by her.", "NTA but I would talk to my boss/the owner.", "NTA. I\u2019d want someone who suggests I would steal from my work fired as well. Sanctimonious b***h.", "NTA OP.  It seems like Chloe straight up accused you of not being able to be responsible with money.  Definitely tell the owner, because you don\u2019t want her attitude towards you to affect your work.", "I don\u2019t think this post belongs here. \n\nFirst of all, you\u2019re nta for offering for her to go home lol. It was her first day(from what I\u2019m gathering) so she really is acting a lil bigger than she should. \n\nShe\u2019s def doing it cause she\u2019s older. I\u2019d just bring it to a manager, let them know about her comments and that they made you uncomfortable", "NTA report her. She accused you of stealing from the till.", "NTA. My guess is that Chloe wants the responsibility of counting the till so she can steal from it.", "From the info you've posted here,  NTA.  17 is young, literally underage, and it's almost certain that she feels some kind of way about the fact that you \n\nA: sat in on her interview (in some capacity)\nB: train her (telling her how/ what to do. Gently (I hope) correcting her as she learns. \nC: are trusted to handle the days till unsupervised, etc\n\nTry to go easy on her. It's pretty humbling for some people to be in a situation like this. But don't take any of her shit either. If you're her supervisor, she needs to respect you. Even if you're not officially her supervisor, it sounds like you've earned your bosses respect and trust, and you're more knowledgeable than she is. She needs to respect that too.  You need to respect her as well. She's probably not stupid, she's just new on the job. \n\nBetter to establish this sooner than later. Be kind, but be firm.", "NTA\n\nYou really need to tell your boss what has happened.  Chloe may be out to get you.  She may want to steal from the till herself and then blame you and she's just setting the scene.

She could be setting it up to take money and accuse/blame you.  If she would have said no because of your safety, being in the store alone being a teen girl being dangerous for you, it would have been more understandable.", "NTA, and I would definitely raise this concern with your manager. It sounds like she is angling to be your unofficial supervisor. And as the veteran at that workplace, you need to nip that in the bud.", "Shes trying to take your job. Stop being nice and only talk to her about work related items. Talk to the owner and bring up the fact she talks about the cash draw and the fact she made the comment I couldn't be trusted with cash. Report and document it all, she wants your job.", "NTA I also have had coworkers like this. You are probably not paranoid. Some people really think they have to teach a younger person, even if it doesn't make sense, like here where you've been there longer and there's no objective reason a teenager cant deal with the till. Tell the owner what she said because if someone (her) causes a problem with the money, she'll blame you.", "This, I think you do need to protect yourself and your position.

When I was in college I worked in retail and there were some older women who would swoop in and suddenly decide they were more qualified with their two weeks of experience than the young girls who had worked there for five years. This is totally a common attitude and it always deserves to be checked.", "NTA- tell the owner what happened so he can hopefully nip that", "Agreed. Input a different reason (race, gender, etc) and it would be immediately apparent what the colleague is saying about OP is NOT okay and management should be informed.

Then when I was made Assistant Manager, there were nights that he was in charge. I still took orders from the kid and I still didn\u2019t try to oversee his counting down tills.

That alone makes me question her honesty. NTA", "NTA. Also, keep the owner and the manager in the loop about this. She needs to go, and you need to let them know why. You have to protect yourself, because it's obvious she is too fragile to take orders from a teenager. Chances are good she'll sabotage you with your boss, so don't wait--tell them NOW. It's also possible she sees you as a great scapegoat when she robs the place.", "NTA", "If cash goes \"missing\"... she will 100% blame it on you. \n\nTell your boss. \n\nLike, yesterday.", "She's right that it isn't safe, but the age crack isn't the point.
