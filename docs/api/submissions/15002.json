Tell your owner. Immediately. Don't wait. \nI can guarantee you that she doesn't like taking orders from a teen, and she'll go out of her way to shove you down while pulling herself up. \n\nConvo needs to go something like this:\n\nBoss, I just wanted to give you a little heads up about X. When we were closing I said they could go since they had kids waiting and all that was left for me was this task, she said \"enter what she said, then her clarification about you being around the money\". ((Add any new incidents as well, and be calm when speaking))\n\nThen tell boss \" I'm not trying to be petty, but it's clear she's already got a discriminating issue with me due to age. I want you to know about it now because it makes me uneasy that she's willing to vocally cast doubts on my character/trustworthiness already when she's only been here x many days, and doesn't know me. ((Add this next sentence only if you want)) You don't have to say anything to her yet, but if she continues I need you to support me and explain things to her\". Or alternative last sentence \" I need you to please support me and explain to her that I am trusted, I am allowed to do xyz, and while I'm not claiming to be her boss, I certainly have more on the job experience and she is definitely not my boss\"\n\nIf your boss won't stand up for you then it's time to look elsewhere because she'll go out of her way to try to subdue you into being bossed around by her.", "NTA but I would talk to my boss/the owner.", "NTA. I\u2019d want someone who suggests I would steal from my work fired as well. Sanctimonious b***h.", "NTA OP.  It seems like Chloe straight up accused you of not being able to be responsible with money.  Definitely tell the owner, because you don\u2019t want her attitude towards you to affect your work.", "I don\u2019t think this post belongs here. \n\nFirst of all, you\u2019re nta for offering for her to go home lol. It was her first day(from what I\u2019m gathering) so she really is acting a lil bigger than she should. \n\nShe\u2019s def doing it cause she\u2019s older. I\u2019d just bring it to a manager, let them know about her comments and that they made you uncomfortable", "NTA report her. She accused you of stealing from the till.", "NTA. My guess is that Chloe wants the responsibility of counting the till so she can steal from it.", "From the info you've posted here,  NTA.  17 is young, literally underage, and it's almost certain that she feels some kind of way about the fact that you \n\nA: sat in on her interview (in some capacity)\nB: train her (telling her how/ what to do. Gently (I hope) correcting her as she learns. \nC: are trusted to handle the days till unsupervised, etc\n\nTry to go easy on her. It's pretty humbling for some people to be in a situation like this. But don't take any of her shit either. If you're her supervisor, she needs to respect you. Even if you're not officially her supervisor, it sounds like you've earned your bosses respect and trust, and you're more knowledgeable than she is. She needs to respect that too.  You need to respect her as well. She's probably not stupid, she's just new on the job. \n\nBetter to establish this sooner than later. Be kind, but be firm.", "NTA\n\nYou really need to tell your boss what has happened.  Chloe may be out to get you.  She may want to steal from the till herself and then blame you and she's just setting the scene.  Or she hates that you are younger than her but are more experienced and she has to take instructions from you.\n\nFor the record, I remember being left managing my dad's busy market stall at 15 and never a thought that I would take the money or skim some off the top.", "INFO could you delete the paragraph indents?

Some people really think they have to teach a younger person, even if it doesn't make sense, like here where you've been there longer and there's no objective reason a teenager cant deal with the till.
