Looking back I can\u2019t imagine why or how she convinced me because I don\u2019t even think I knew her, but I was \u201cnice\u201d so I let her. Only for her to still be wearing my shoes when my turn came up, so then I was the one at the disadvantage of not having shoes, and absolutely it changed my performance. I don\u2019t know if she got a part but I definitely didn\u2019t, and maybe I would have if I\u2019d worn my own shoes.
