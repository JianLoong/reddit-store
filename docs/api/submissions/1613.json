The examination center didn\u2019t have an extra stethoscope and asked him to borrow one from the other candidates. I was starting a little later that the rest so he asked me for my stethoscope.\n\nSome background. A stethoscope needs to be put into the ears and I don\u2019t like sharing mine as it feels gross to put something in my ears that has been in someone else\u2019s ears. Additionally I didn\u2019t want to have to worry about getting my stethoscope back in time or getting delayed in anyway for my exam if I lent it to someone else. Finally right before the exam I like to be in a focused zone and I don\u2019t want to talk to or engage with anyone at all.\n\nAs soon as he approached me and started to speak me, I said please don\u2019t talk to me I need to focus. Perhaps I could have been more polite here but I didn\u2019t want to get out of my focus zone or think about anything else before my exam. I was mentally revising my examination routine and really didn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\n\nHe still proceeded to engage with with and said I need your stethoscope, I forgot mine and the examiners said to borrow yours.\nI replied saying I needed mine and I don\u2019t share my stethoscope. He started pleading, and I very firmly said stop disturbing me, stop talking to me. He walked off in a huff and was visibly upset. I was pretty irritated too because I had been distracted and had to refocus to get back into my zone.\n\nAfter the exam he was giving me nasty looks. It was pretty clear he did poorly. I think it\u2019s a reasonable guess that someone who forgot to carry critical equipment before a major exams probably didn\u2019t take preparation for the exam too seriously.\n\nA few of my exam going colleagues think I was an AH for not helping him and for refusing to talk to him. From my perspective I felt he was an AH for disturbing me before a critical exam. I had been preparing for this for months. The instructions are clear to bring your own stethoscope. If he didn\u2019t have one, the exam center should have had a back up. Besides I really didn\u2019t want my stethoscope in his ears. I didn\u2019t want to risk having to look for him if he forgot to return it. This exam has multiple stations in multiple different rooms and if he went into another room with it and forgot to give me my stethoscope I\u2019d have a hard time getting it back.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1667735652, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yno05c/aita_for_not_sharing_my_medical_equipment_during/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
