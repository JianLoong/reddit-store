Only for her to still be wearing my shoes when my turn came up, so then I was the one at the disadvantage of not having shoes, and absolutely it changed my performance. I don\u2019t know if she got a part but I definitely didn\u2019t, and maybe I would have if I\u2019d worn my own shoes. Now I can see it\u2019s not worth setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. \nAlthough you do probably want to get over the ear thing...

Even so, my stethoscope is like a limb to me- I\u2019ll lend it to people I know but giving it to a stranger before an exam would be asking a lot- what if they forgot to give it back?
