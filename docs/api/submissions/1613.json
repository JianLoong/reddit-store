Except I'd see the residents later on without my stethoscope (they'd say they forgot it, lent it to another person etc) and I had to track down who has my stethoscope.

Resources, attention, and time must be taken from the most organized and redistributed to the less organized \"free spirits\" whose genius must be nurtured.
