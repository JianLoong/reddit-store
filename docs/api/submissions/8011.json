Ive never been close to my dads parents as my parents were divorced when I was a toddler and I grew up only with my mums family. I only ever saw my dads parents against my will when my dad made me, maybe a handful of times a year. my dads entire family are homophobic and anti lgbt and very religious, but in particular his parents are extremely religious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI came out to my dad to an expected negative response when I was 14, however I begged him not to tell his family. Of course, he ignored that and did, and when I was 17 I overheard him and his mother talking about how I was lgbt in a very derogatory way when they thought I wasnt there. At the time I had dreadful mental health, so even though it wasnt a surprise, when I heard his mother yell about how I was going to hell, it was the final straw for me. From that point on I made it clear I wanted no relationship with my grandparents whatsoever and refused to speak to them. Over the years my dad has done everything he can to put me in a position to make me talk to them + has gotten really angry at me for not doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey still give me gifts at xmas as a way to try n get me to interact with them. due to feeling fearful of my dad's repercussions, I sent a thank you email this xmas. Lo and behold today my dad and his mother turned up unannounced at the house im living in, which due to extremely high rent and me living on minimum wage, is a house my dad owns and he allows me to stay there, this means he has leverage over me and I feel like im indebted to him. my dad tried to trick me into opening the door without me knowing she was hiding behind it. I realised she was there at the last minute and chose not to open the door and told him she couldnt come inside. He got really mad, told her, she got all upset and I overheard her say \"oh but we came all this way\" and \"oh but I brought this food\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI even considered just going out + getting it over with, but I was experiencing fight or flight and had frozen out of fear. Years back when I was 14 they did a similar thing where they turned up at my mums house without asking her permission and forced their way inside, my dads mother was sobbing hysterically in my face and I had to hold my bedroom door shut to get her away from me, I had no idea what she was trying to do. it was traumatic. This experience today reminded me of it so I couldnt force myself to face her. Eventually, after calling out my name for about 10 minutes, she left and my dad angrily left as well. Now im terrified of what's hes going to try and to do me to punish me, including potentially kicking me out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately I have nowhere else to stay (trust me, ive tried everything), ive been searching for more work for years, but its especially hard as a full time uni student to get anything that affords rent. My dad thinks im cruel bc shes just an old lady + he claims she cares about me, + i keep refusing to talk to her.

You are who you are and if your family can't accept you for who you are that's too bad.\n\nI would so like to point out you don't have to be afraid of her.

I was wondering if your paternal grandparents want to make peace ? They should handle it in a better manner. Please explain to your father.", "\"She's just an old lady\". Bollocks.\n\nFully confirms my life-long conviction that shitty old people were shitty young people. Fuck her and your dad.\n\nQuite why your dad keeps trying to force a relationship on you for anything else other than cruelty is a mystery.

Your grandmother seems to be trying to reach out to you and form some kind of relationship with you. Unless I\u2019m missing something she doesn\u2019t call you names and still buys you gifts. You should extend some sort of an olive branch and try to see her. If she says something homophobic and insults you, your sexuality or your lifestyle then you have every right to fully cut ties. I don\u2019t think what your father did was bad either for what it\u2019s worth. It seems like they both care about you and unless I\u2019m misreading something aren\u2019t actively attacking your sexuality in the present day. Your father is letting you stay in his property for free or at a reduced rent and it seems like you are an adult. You mentioned your grandmother was homophobic privately and I think that is significantly different than being despicable to your face because it could be as much as her trying to make sense of the homophobic elements in her religion/culture than anything to do with you. I\u2019m certainly not condoning homophobia but perhaps a little kindness here from you would go a long way and help the healing begin for your family.\n\nI wish you luck!", "i'm sorry that you've had to go through a similar experience, i'm glad your family respects who you are though and i wish you the best. thank you, i'm trying to stay strong.", "thank you for this, id been feeling really conflicted because a lot of people have this attitude that you should get on your knees and grovel and always be at a parents beck and call if you havent moved out by 18, but realistically in this day and age, and particularly where i live, rent is at an astronomical all time high, im working on all my free days, im at uni every other day. i just dont know how its possible.\n\nand while he is financially very well off, im of course aware that he's allowing me to stay at his house, and i am very grateful for that. but i also cannot be controlled by that leverage or not allowed to have any boundaries as an adult, nor should i have to be subjected to cruelty or abuse just because of it. at least this is what i believe.", "as i said in the post i make minimum wage and am at uni full time, i have been looking for more work for years but with the current rental market where i live even wealthy families are struggling to get a rental. i fully agree though that i 100% want to cut them all off the first chance i get to move out.", "Yes, let's justify abusing others.\n\nPeople must looooove you.", "i have been considering asking my father about that specifically, part of what makes me feel like that's unlikely though is even though i haven't exactly been vague about it, i don't think they actually understand that them being homophobic isn't loving, they think it's so normal they don't get how hurtful it is.", "just to clarify a few points as it seems maybe my post was too vague:\n\n\"If she says something homophobic and insults you, your sexuality or your lifestyle then you have every right to fully cut ties.\"\n\nI tried to make it clear in the post but she has already done this, she said i was going to hell, which is indeed why i proceeded to sever ties. prior to this comment, i had put up with her being of an older generation and religious without making any comment on it.\n\n\"It seems like they both care about you and unless I\u2019m misreading something aren\u2019t actively attacking your sexuality in the present day. \"\n\nthey are 110% actively attacking my sexuality in the present day, he's made it clear he thinks i'm just delusional and confused and need to be converted, among other horrible present day comments he's made. this is absolutely not something in the past, it's ongoing.\n\nto be honest i'm not sure my grandmother is even capable of understanding a world where she isn't homophobic, she truly to her core believes gay people are an abomination. this is why i dont think its appropriate for us to maintain a relationship, as i will never be able to be myself.", "I wish you the best too; if you ever need a bit of encouragement, feel free to message me, I always have tons of advice to give (or try to lol)", "Are roommates an option at all?

I understand that is not ideal especially depending on your area and gender. (They are more likely to house a single adult male in a hostel/homeless shelter type setting)\n\nBut, as a full time student, SPEAK TO YOUR UNI.
