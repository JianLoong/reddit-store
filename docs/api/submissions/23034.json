Santana is lucky to have such an amazing dad in her corner. For all intents and purposes you are her dad. It takes a special man to accept children that aren\u2019t his and treat them like his own kids.", "I think it\u2019s 3 things.\n\n1) makes my wife look bad that she couldn\u2019t be bothered to get out of bed to go get her daughter.\n\n2) makes him look good as he\u2019d \u201cnever hire a nanny!\u201d\n\n3) \u201cputs me in my place\u201d so to speak.", "Op posts a story about their life, asking for judgements and discussion of their story, but don\u2019t get it twisted, this post is *really* about petefriend86", "Another reason to add to the \"Why engage?\" list.\n\nIf OP doesn't engage, the bio-dad may think he's winning his one-sided little war of snide remarks and keep doing them.\n\nIf he keeps it up, in a few years, it may not be OP that responds to such remarks, it may be the daughter herself because she's tired of seeing the step-dad she loves being put down. At some point, she may even decide dad's not going to change and start dialing back her time with him.\n\nOPs polite and calm response also leaves the dad no way to escalate without it being clear to all and sundry that the dad is the one the one provoking the situation.\n\nA calm response like this also a good way to make it not fun for the dad to do his jabs. Not being fun might help to get him to stop before it gets to the above mentioned point where the daughter actively starts getting involved.", "My dad had a boss who was a dick and drove a big truck with blue balls. I mocked him so fucking loudly one day after he treated my dad poorly. Lol he took them off, and I'd like to think I bullied him as a 14 year old", "My dog has caught a few birds over the last year, so I decided she needed bells to warn the birds.

Just so you know they don't actually know anything about the punisher", "Probably has those stacks with the bypassed emissions so he can Roll Coal on EVs when he sees them", "Stupid bio-dad. Santana has clearly made her choices and he\u2019s only poisoning his own relationship with her.", "You forgot about: 4) tells family he's paying child support to fund your salary.", "> He was throwing a BBQ and had some family there.  \n>  \n>Mark texted my wife later saying I \u201chumiliated him\u201d and given I\u2019d likely never see those people again, I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\n\nDoes this man not think you are going to be a future life events, like recitals, graduation, wedding, etc.?  Or is he not planning on having his family involved in her life.  Because either way, that's very short-sighted of him.", "Me three.", "My mind went straight to somewhere inappropriate when I saw blue balls \ud83d\ude02", "I just always think they're so small, relative to the size of the truck...", "Wait until your dog learns how to move so the bells don't work anymore. My cats had that down in a week.", "That\u2019d require him paying it but I\u2019m sure he lies to them and says he does.", "Snicker \ud83c\udfc6 my poor man's gold \ud83d\ude02  oh and NTA!
