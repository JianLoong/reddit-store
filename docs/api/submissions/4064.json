We've been dating for two years now and his parents and I just can't click, they're deeply religious (like, deeply) and they don't approve of the way I dress. We've had several fights over this in the past to the point I just stopped visiting unless necessary. I like my body, I look good and I like to dress in a way my body shows (nothing too revealing, but nice and hot). I won't be in my 20's forever and I want to enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nMy bf also has no problem with the way I dress and enjoys it, but I try to be respectful now, I don't visit and if I do, I dress in a way I still like but they won't have any problem, until last weekend. Since it was my bf's party and he was aware of it, he wanted me to wear a specifically outfit for the night (kind alike showing me off, which I don't mind), the top was a white corset-blouse like that you tie in the back on you neck and really pushes the boobs together with a  blue tennis skirt and high boots. I saw the fight coming, so I threw a hoodie in the car and we went to his parents. \n\nThey obviously hated it and we just barely crossed the door when his mom came at me demanding me to change. His parents, my bf and I got into a huge fight and we decided to leave, the party got cancelled and we did something else with our friends. His mom texted me calling me a horrible brat because they put their heart into that party and I felt bad enough to tell my sisters. One of them said I was an AH and I should've cool my bf off, change and just let them enjoy the party, my other sis agrees with us, so IDK? I'm torn because it was HIS party, but it was THEIR house and it looked so cute and I could see they really did their best to prepare everything.", "created_utc": 1670297919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdu2du/aita_for_ruining_my_bfs_bday_party_because_i/", "score": 500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your boyfriend was foolish for asking you to dress in a way that y\u2019all knew would make his parents mad, especially when they were throwing the party for you. \n3. His parents for making such a big deal out of clothes that they ruined a party. \n\nTbh your boyfriend is the worst here. He shouldn\u2019t have asked you to wear that. If you had said no, then he would\u2019ve been upset with you. He basically put you in a no win situation. He needs to decide what time of relationship he wants to have with his parents and communicate that clearly with everyone involved.", "This was written by a man. A woman would know the word \u201chalter top\u201d", "INFO Why did your BF purposely choose an outfit that would send his parents over the edge. And, why do you not know the word for halter top and refer to a micro mini as a tennis skirt?", "Info: what was the point in grabbing the hoodie if you weren\u2019t going to wear it while you were there?", "ESH. Why are you going in these outfits? Why is your boyfriend requesting them? There is a time and a place. Show off, he young and pretty, I love dressing in cute outfits! But to see his parents you\u2019re going to wear something that\u2019s almost deliberately provocative to their own home? Be a little more aware of your surroundings and destinations, wear the outfit to dinner with him instead max It just seems like you guys are trying to fight. \n\nAlso, though, they shouldn\u2019t police how you dress or talk down to you.", "ESH\n\nWhile I believe everyone should dress how they want and feel comfortable, with minimal exception (still don't wear white to a wedding, follow dress codes of churches, mosques, etc), what was the point? You knew it was going to be the argument it was, so you and bf were just going like that to cause the drama?\n\nIf he wants to get back at his parents for something, I'd let him do it on his own.\n\nI also don't think someone should tell someone else what to wear, again with minimal exception.\n\nBut, again, what was the point? If you 2 didn't want to go to the party parents arranged, tell them you don't want to go.

If you didn't want to get in a fight you both would have prevented it by not agitating his parents. \n\nHe needs to also figure something out with his parents. If you both are set on not confirming to their views (which is good and fine) he needs to have that conversation and set those boundaries with his parents or you both just need to not go to these fake shallow family gatherings. \n\nAnd if course the parents are AHs if it was about the party and your bf they wouldn't have picked a fight either. \n\nNo one could set aside their differences for the sake of just enjoying each other's company because ESH and you all should stop pretending that getting together is useful.", "You are 24 years old, and for some reason you feel the need to go around your boyfriend\u2019s parents house trying to look all \u201chot\u201d and \u201csexy\u201d?

It sounds to me like you love the negative attention, and I really don\u2019t agree with someone getting a say-so in their kids adult relationships, but if his parents end up causing you to break up, I can\u2019t say I really blame them in this case.\n\nYTA.", "That outfit sounds vile. Also YTA.", "NAH. But your bf is kinda the asshole for intentionally picking a fight using you. It sounds like you would\u2019ve been okay with wearing a \u201cparent approved\u201d outfit but he chose one knowing it would piss his parents off. Did you ask him why he did that?", "YTA.  Your bf knew his parents would flip out. He insists you dress in away that both of you know will cause his parents to react.  You knew this and went along with it.

If the plan was to just hang out with your friends and not go to the parents house to begin with, cool. Whatever. But he should've known it would cause an argument, and he intentionally placed you in a bad light.\n\nAt the end of the day, it was his parent's house and you should follow their rules, even if you don't agree with it. It was one day in a year and you could've gone out before or after, or the next day. They shouldn't have attacked you the second you walked in the door and cry about how you ruined their party, but still.", "Actually, I say it\u2019s your boyfriend who sucks. Something tells me he didn\u2019t want to celebrate with his parents so he asked you to do something that he knew would cause a fight, and give him an excuse to leave. Since it\u2019s his birthday and that was his only request from you, obviously you agreed.", "YTA and even though I love the confidence you have in yourself and your relationship\u2026 you overstepped majorly. There is a time and a place where to dress appropriately for an occasion or to express your own personality\u2026 but you blew yours. Why, just why do you think that your are not the a-hole? It is not just they way that you dress, btw, they are horrendous and in the wrong about that, but the fact that you are not showing them an ounce of respect.\n\nYou even wrote as much that you knew it would cause a fight so why start it in the first place? You also literally are describing yourself as dressing up like a sex doll (I know I will be down voted for saying this) and still thinking that a knowingly conservative couple would just be okay with it. Wake. Up. It may have been his party but he did not pay for it. He did not host it. He is not a factor in this moment. It is fully his parents and you both fucked that up.\n\nHere is an extreme comparison. Being the bride and having his entire family wearing white too because they felt like it. There is an unspoken rule to not wear white just like it is an unspoken rule to respect the house of the people you visit. You will never have a relationship with his parents now and I hope you can live with that. \n\nLast thing. I am DEEPLY bothered by the fact that you seem to believe that you can only be cute and hot in your 20\u2019s. That is some major agism going on and vanity. People can still look hot into their 50\u2019s and beyond but, more importantly, if your boyfriend is also VERY focused on that aspect too\u2026 is he going to last while the two of you age? Looks only last for so long but nothing about your post mentions anything besides his preference to having you look good.\n\nGood luck for the next few year", "You should dress appropriately for the occasion. If the party is at a church then you should wear what would be acceptable for a church.  If the party is at a beach then you can wear a bikini.  But if the party is at their house then, their house their rules, so when you go to their house then you should respect their rules.  That's simply being polite.  You knew what would happen before you went there, so YTA.  There is no way for you to ever have a relationship with his parents if you deliberately provoke them by being disrespectful.", "I'm going to go with YTA and here's why. He requested the outfit and you knew what was going to happen because you even brought a hoodie. You knew how they would react and instead of either telling him no or you need to talk with them before you didn't. It seems like you let the occasion and vanity get the better of your sense. I've been your age and I still dress how I want but I also know when to tone it down for the host. You're young and I get it, but if you are a guest you're a guest.", "NTA. If I understand this correctly, the outfit you wore was chosen by your boyfriend (you liked it too and agreed to wear it, but he's the one who wanted you to wear this specifically for his party). If this is the case, how could you possibly be the asshole?\n\nThe party was for him, and at his parents' house. But it was him who wanted you dressed that way, and he already knows how his parents are. If he didn't care the obvious backlash that outfit would trigger, why should you? \n\nHis parents are entitled to kick you out of their home if they disapprove of how you dress (no matter how stupid I think that is), but they can't blame it on you for their own son not agreeing with their dress code values and preferring to leave the party rather than having you change. They're assholes for blaming this on you, instead of acknowledging that their son is different from them and doesn't follow their modesty principles. \n\nThe sister that told you it was your job to \"cool your boyfriend down\", change and make sure he enjoyed the party, has some deeply concerning views on relationships and I'd be worried about her being a doormat with her own partner and in-laws.", "INFO: did you put the hoodie on at any point before you yelled at them?", "NTA\n\nHe specifically requested you to dress in a particular outfit. It's his mess to deal with his parents. All you could've done better is to spell it out for them that your outfit was by request from their son. Even after the fact it would be a good thing to at least tell them.", "ESH. You are super disrespectful towards his parents. You shouldn\u2019t want to be shown off as a trophy dressed as a bunny. The lack of respect you have for yourself is scary. \n\nYour bf is an asshole for being disrespectful towards his parents as well. Plus he is an asshole for thinking of you as nothing more than an object. That is terrible bf behavior and truly disgusting. He is honestly the biggest asshole though because he knew what would happen and used you to get out of the party.", "NTA\n\n1. It sounds to me like your bf was spoiling for this fight. Maybe he didn\u2019t want the party to be at his parents house. Maybe he\u2019s tired of their judging. Whatever it is, he put the wheels in motion on this. Could you have acted to avoid the conflict? Sure. Are you obligated to? Nope.\n\n2. Fuck purity culture and religious people that feel like they get to tell other people how to think and act and dress. I\u2019ve been damaged enough by purity culture that I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at you two trolling them. People like that need to get a life. Not sorry.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your boyfriends party and your boyfriend asked you to wear a special outfit for him. I\u2019m happy that it sounds like he defended you from his parents, but ultimately his mother should never had messaged you in the first place. Tell his mother to communicate with him from now on. This is an issue between your boyfriend and his parents. You are simply a bystander. \n\nHonestly, I would communicate this more with your boyfriend about this situation between his parents and you. He put you in a very difficult situation and it seems like it will continue for a while.", "NTA. Your boyfriend kind of used you to get back at them, if he had a revenge plan he should have shared it with you, but you're not a bad person for wearing an outfit he chose to his birthday party.", "YTA so is your BF. \n\nYou KNOW how his parents are and that they would not approve. The party was being thrown by them at their house. You were not going to a club or bar - you were not the hosts, so yeah, a little respect goes a long way. \n\nYou dressed how your BF requested and it was his bday - I get that. But you should have reminded him that since you were going to his parents you didn't want to create issues and dressed more demurely.  You could dress up for him later. \n\nI am wondering if your BF is using you to trigger or punish his parents for something, because this really seemed deliberate. \n\nIf you think you're ever going to marry this guy - why are you deliberately trying to antagonize his parents?

No, this isn't victim blaming. It's only victim blaming when someone is blamed for an action taken against them that they had no part in or no reasonable way to prevent. That doesn't hold here since agreeing to wear it renders you complicit, and no, your BF being annoyed at you doesn't waive any responsibility here.

They don't have to like it, but they do have to respect her right to choose her own clothes. So, the parents are definitely TA's for blowing this so far out of proportion that they totally ruined a party they spent time and money planning. Cutting off their nose to spite their faces much?!\n\nI'm on the fence about the boyfriend - I do find it weird that boyfriend asked her to wear a specific outfit that he knew his parents would hate. I'm not sure why he didn't just let OP decide what she wanted to wear. I suspect he actively wanted to get a rise out of his parents.

There's some basic etiquette to being a good host. Part of that is you don't kick someone out because you don't like their clothes, especially if there isn't a formal dress code, and doubly so if it's the guest of honors significant other. I doubt they would've acted this way if one of their friends, or a neighbor, showed up in the same outfit.
