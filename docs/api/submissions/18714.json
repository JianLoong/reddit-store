I think this is not about a family holiday. It's about her having a holiday and saddling everyone else with her child.

Right or wrong, she had probably already planned things out in her head about activities and outings, and she was asking the family if they would join her on this trip that she was planning.

She clearly just wants to stay home in her perfect little town instead of going anywhere. \n\nIt's one thing if you're just arguing on where you want to stay. That's something you can work out. She doesn't want to do anything even remotely close to what the cousin was trying to plan. At that point, just be honest and say you dont want to go on the vacation.  \n\nHer objections don't even make sense. She's grossed out by lakes, but is fine renting a place with a pool? Why, pools are infinitely more disgusting than lakes. She just knows she is going to be responsible for her cousin's kids (which she later claims are the only reason she agreed to go) which she's not into, but the location of where they go wouldn't change that situation. If her cousin planned on just dumping her kids on her, that same thing can happen anywhere. \n\nOP agreed to go on vacation with her cousin, and is now trying to completely change the original idea to suit her, because she never really wanted to go in the first place.", "No, I'm just reasonable.

The only reason she agreed is so she can pat herself on the back for providing the kids with a family vacation. She literally says that she only agreed because her cousin is a single mom.\n\nShe's simply trying to be a \"good person\" for the kids while changing every aspect of this vacation into what's most ideal for her.\n\n>It\u2019s not ok for one person to unilaterally decide what the location and plans are\n\nThis is literally what OP is trying to do.", "That's not my opinion, that is what even the OP is openly admitting.

However, there needs to be a discussion and a consensus on where to go. Hence the group chat. \n\nCousin has stopped responding because everyone isn\u2019t all in on her idea.

I am just going along with this because she is a single mom and wants to have a family vacation for her kids. \n\nThe OP doesn't even want to go on vacation at all. She just wants to get her brownie points for being thoughtful of her cousin's kids. She's only willing to do the vacation at all of its in jer town, what she wants to do, at the places she's okay with. She doesn't care about her cousin or her wants at all, she just wants to stay in her town that she finds superior. \n\n>Cousin has stopped responding because everyone isn\u2019t all in on her idea. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s not ok. \n\nThe OP said that her cousin first said that she was going to stop planning, and then went silent. She realized that the vacation she wanted to take isn't going to happen. So the cousin, herself, opted out. Instead of continuing to fight for the vacation she wanted, she gave up. Is that really unreasonable? \n\nI'm fact, which of the two statements are more reasonable to you?\n\nA) I'll go on a vacation with you and your kids, as long as: it's not the lake because lakes are gross to me, but pools somehow arent, we stay in my home town so I dont have to travel, there's strict guarantees that I won't have to watch your kids (even though they are the only reason I'm agreeing to go) and we do all these other things instead of what you wanted to do.\n\nB) You know what? I'm not going to plan this vacation anymore. \n\nPretty sure B is the reasonable response after your entire idea has been changed, and it's no longer a vacation you want to take.", ">It must be nice living in a world where the first person with a suggestion get their way 100% of the time. Let me walk you through it.\n\nThat's not what I'm saying, at all. I agree with the principle of what you're saying but that's not what happened here. \n\nYou're obviously overlooking this from the OP: \n\n>Just to add I really hate traveling, we live in the perfect summer town we don't need to go anywhere. I am just going along with this because she is a single mom and wants to have a family vacation for her kids. \n\nShe doesn't want to go anywhere. She doesn't want a vacation at all. She is strictly agreeing so she can get brownie points for spending time with her cousin's kids that have a single mom. \n\nIf she doesn't want to go on vacation, she can simply say she doesn't want to go on vacation, and wants to stay at home. Instead. She's trying to get her cousin to change her desired vacation spot to her town, because then she doesn't have to travel. \n\n>1. Cousin want's a family vacation.\n1. OP and others show interest.\n1. Cousin wants a super expensive lakehouse.\n1. Op and OP's mom offer other ideas.\n1. Cousin freaks out and shuts down.\n\nUh, yeah that's not accurate. \n\n1. Cousin wants to take a vacation. (Op os calling it a family vacation, but we don't even know if it was presented that way.)\n2. OP wasn't ever interested, and only agreed because she felt the kids need jer there since their mom is a single mother.\n3. Cousin starts sharing locations that she's interested in\n4. OP shoots down the idea because she assumes she'll babysit the entire time, doesn't like lakes (even admits she's being a baby about this) and finds her own town superior\n5. Cousin says she's going to stop planning the vacation and goes silent in the thread because it's clear that the vacation she wanted to take isn't going to happen\n\nThe Cousin wanted to take a vacation, it isn't going to be the vacation she wanted, so in the end she opted out. How is the Cousin TA here? \n\nAgain OP openly admits she doesn't even want the vacation, and still tries to make it all about her. She's clearly TA", "I would agree with everything you said except that the cousin wanted to rent an expensive Airbnb. If the cousin is able to afford that, she can still go with her kids. Nobody is stopping her. But if everyone is supposed to contribute to the cost... yeah, everyone is entitled to choose not to spend that kind of money. If the cousin said \"I'm renting this lake house and you are invited\" and the OP said \"I hate lakes, you need to rent a beach house\" then yes, OP would be TA. But that's not what happened", ">I would agree with everything you said except that the cousin wanted to rent an expensive Airbnb. If the cousin is able to afford that, she can still go with her kids. Nobody is stopping her.\n\nWhat do you mean no one is stopping her? The entire OP is asking whether or not that stopping her makes them TA. OP literally tried to change the entire destination because she doesn't want to travel. And doesn't like lakes. Notice, she didn't say anything at all about choosing a different bnb, or location at the lake. She will only entertain ideas in or near her town because she doesn't want to travel.\n\n>If the cousin said \"I'm renting this lake house and you are invited\" and the OP said \"I hate lakes, you need to rent a beach house\" then yes, OP would be TA. But that's not what happened\n\nThat is what happened, though. Reread the post and count how many times OP either outright says, or implies, that her town is superior, and the only place she wants to spend her summer. OP will only entertain ideas that are in or near her \"perfect beach town\". \n\nReally pay attention to just how much of her objections center around her already being in the perfect location. There is a clear implication that she thinks that her cousin's proposed vacation is a step-down to her, and she won't have any of it. It's not about money, it's about status. If it was truly about money she could have suggested cheaper alternatives at the lake. She won't budge on the destination which is clear. There was never talk about that. Only \"what about this which is close to me?\"\n\nThe last part of jer post is the most telling. She just wants her cousin's kids to jave a family vacation since their parent is a single mother. Okay, sure. Do the kids of the cousin feel like that's needed? Since the oldest is 4, I doubt it. Thus is, again, OP feeling superior, and only agreeing so she can help out these kids that are in such need of family, since they obviously lack that with a single parent.\n\nLiterally everything in the OP is entitled, condescending, and reeks of a superiority complex. I'm legit baffled how so many people aren't seeing this. Really read over the OP with the context that OP thinks she is just outright better than her cousin and you'll see what I'm saying. She basically outright says she doesn't want this and is doing her cousin's kids a favor, which is the only reason she agreed in the first place."]}
