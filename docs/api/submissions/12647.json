I had asked my wife if she was going to do anything special for it and she simply told me she wasn't sure. I was hurt and upset because I normally go all out for her birthday. Dinner, movie, gifts etc. \nI went to work as per normal and about an hour before my day was about to end, my mom called and informed me that she had planned a small party at her house for me. Just family. I decided to go straight from work. I do not have a phone so I couldn't call and inform my wife. Ps. She and my mom really don't get along.\n        I ended staying at the party till about 11pm before going home. I live about 10 minutes drive from my mom's house. When I got home my wife and 2 kids were nowhere to be found. A birthday cake was in the trash and so was dinner ( it looked like steak and triple baked potatoes, my favorite). A birthday card with my kids  hand prints and paint was also in the trash. I figured she got angry for no reason and decided to spend the night at her sister's place. This morning she came home and completely blew up at me. She said that I value the family I came from more than the family I created.\n             I tried to explain that wasn't the case. She cried and said I hurt her. I just don't see how. Now she gave me an ultimatum to let one family go 100%. No communication nor anything. I told her that I won't make that decision because I need to communicate with my mom and I can't stop communicating with my kids. Now she is threatening to take the kids when I am at work and moving 150 miles away from me and going no contact.

You went and didn't even tell your wife you were going. \n\nYou're trying to blame your wife, saying she didn't make a big deal of your birthday in the morning so you assumed she wasn't going to make a big deal of it that evening. Your feelings were hurt so you decided to go to your mom's party despite your wife and kids being excluded. You *punished* your wife and kids for not making a big enough deal of your birthday that morning by not coming home and not calling. \n\nYou hurt your wife, and even worse, you hurt your kids. What kind of mom and grandma doesn't invite her son's wife and kids to a birthday party for their husband/father? This is who you chose over your wife and kids.", "\u201cShe got angry for no reason\u201d\n\ndude, from the evidence left behind- cake, meal, card, she clearly planned a surprise family dinner for your birthday. You\u2019re completely disregarding how you had any part in her anger, she and the kids waited for you to come home to spend time together but instead of finding any way to contact her, say- borrowing a work phone, etc- you just disregarded the family you created and disregarded her feelings.   \nim sure both sides could\u2019ve handled it better but due to the tone you regard your wife in, i have to vote YTA.   \nby the sounds of her ultimatum and actions(leaving for the night) I would assume this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve disregarded the family you created.", "Your mom had a party for you  and invited your family, which apparently does not include your wife and kids?

She had every right to be angry about this and I truly doubt this is the first time your mom has pulled something like this. \n\nDo your wife a favor and go back to your mommy\u2019s. Let your wife find someone who puts her first because you definitely won\u2019t. \n\nYTA.", "As per your comments, your mother said some incredibly racist things about your own kids, yet somehow she\u2019s the one you choose to spend your birthday with?

Time to get a divorce lawyer. Does your mom have an extra bedroom?", "YTA. You both are wrong for different reasons.\nTo begin with you should have called your wife from your mom's place if you don't have a phone. It is a basic thing you are supposed to do if you are going to be out of the house for such a long duration after work. Especially more if it is a special day like your birthday and you are having a party 10 minutes away. She is right to say that you chose the family you came from because you didn't even invite her to celebrate with you and your mom. Just because they don't get along that well doesn't mean that you just ignore her completely and not inform her. \n\n>I figured she got angry for no reason and decided to spend the night at her sister's place.\n\nNo reason? Seriously dude? From the way you have written it I am assuming you didn't even call after returning home to check where she and your kids are. \nYour wife isn't wrong to be mad at you but I feel it is a bit too far to completely let go of your other family because of something you did. Your kids should have their grandparents and relatives if they are good. \nINFO: Does you mom have problem with the kids too? Do they ostracize the kids too like they do with your wife?\n\nEdit: Okay I think you are definitely the AH. Your wife isn't taking it too far after reading your response about your mother not being able to love her grandkids \"equally\".", "YES YTA - Definitely could have avoided that whole situation with minimum effort \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 like cmon one phone call from any phone", "YTA", "YTA You would have had accesses to phones in this day & age, even that of family & friends. Had your wife & kids ever not bothered with your birthday in the past? Sounds like they were downplaying it when you'd ask to surprise you. Most people could get along with another for one day for a special event so the two gatherings could've been combined. Perhaps you should go live with your mother.", "Your 38 or 14? YTA!!!", "YTA. If your mom called you to tell you about the party, which she deliberately excluded your WIFE and KIDS from, then you could have called your wife. \n\nInstead you chose to have a tantrum, shit all over everything she did for your birthday, and run to mommy\u2014who continues to be allowed to treat your wife like garbage.", "Yta.", "I really think your mom purposely made you this party and would not allow you to contact your wife as a way to hurt her. Your parents sound terrible. You have a family and children - unless you want to be divorced - you need to be a father and not a mommas boy. I would seriously recommend couples counseling on how to set boundries with your parents but still maintain a relationship with them. OP I do feel bad you are in the middle but you need to be sensitivr to your families feelings knowing the strained relationship even more:", "YTA. \n\nYou couldn't pick up your work phone and call your wife? Seriously? And no one will let you use their phone to tell your wife where you are? That right there is enough go very low contact with your relatives. They would not allow you to contact your wife and children. Your wife had no way to know where you were and no way to contact you in an emergency. \n\nYour wife is nicer than I am. I would have suspected where you were and shown up at the door with the cake, card and dinner to \"deliver\" it to you personally.", "Why didn't you call your wife when you got to your Mother's? Having no phone isn't an excuse. I'm sure everyone there had one. It sounds like your wife and children were trying to surprise you and you completely ruined it. You were acting like a child thinking your wife did nothing for your Birthday and instead of apologizing, you took no accountability.\n\nThe fact that your wife gave you an ultimatum is ridiculous. You should never have to choose between your parents/siblings and your wife/children.\n\nYou guys need couples counseling. At the end of day, there are two innocent children stuck in the middle of your drama and nonsense. If you guys can't get it together and act like adults, maybe you should get divorced.", "ESH - how do you let your mother throw you a birthday party that doesn't even include your kids?  The bad blood between her and your wife also includes the kids? Your mom is an AH for that too.\n\nYour wife went nuclear, but it sounds like you have pulled this shit before, so maybe she is justified.\n\nAlso, if your mom told you while at work, you could have called the wife from work...", "This is really a case where (almost) ESH. The kids are really the only innocents here. \n\nYour wife might have wanted to surprise you, but should have at least said she was going to do something for you.\n\nYour mother definitely shouldn't be planning you a party without informing your wife and kids. \n\nYour decision to not communicate where you were heading is on you.\n\nAll of these are AH moves. \n\nWho doesn't have a phone in 2023? Sorry, but this I can't get past. Somehow your mother sent smoke signals to you to get your attention?", "ESH. (Cept the kids)\n\nYou both need to actually comunicate.\n\nShe was trying to surprise you. You went to your moms without calling her. From her reaction this is not new behavior.", "ESH\n\nYou couldnt call your wife for a full night?  No one at you mums house has a phone?\n\nYour wife for wanting you to cut off your family.", "ESH. \n\nOP sucks for not calling his wife after getting to his mother's house. Wife sucks for an ultimatum that you renounce your family and threatening to move so far away with your kids. \n\nThere has to be more to this story for her to make such an ultimatum. I find it hard to believe that this is the first time you've seemingly chosen your born-into family over the one you created with your wife.", "You.. don't have a phone? You really expect us to believe that? I mean if that is really true, I think she overreacted but I feel like you're saying this only to act like they couldn't have contacted you to find your whereabouts too, or did you just ignore her calls? Also you said your mom called you.. on what, your typewriter? Well I'd say she overreacted (she did) if there really was no way for her to contact you, but you were only 10 mins away and didn't care to bring your kids? This is so weird. ESH.", "Happy Birthday.....you and your wife are both assholes.", "NTA but you should of called when you got to your Mom\u2019s house. She still would of been mad but not that mad. However with that being said she is being completely selfish about you cutting of your family, and threatening to take the kids.
