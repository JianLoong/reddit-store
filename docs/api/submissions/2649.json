The conversation went like this:\n\nMe: Hi, just wanted to let you know your car is blocking the side walk.\n\nHim: Oh, that's not my car, it's my buddies.\n\nMe: Oh ok, is there some way you can move it? It's completely blocking the side walk.\n\nHim: What are you, with the city or something?\n\nMe: No, I'm just out walking my dog and saw you were blocking the side walk.\n\nHim: So you ring my door bell at midnight just to tell me I'm blocking the side walk?\n\nMe: Yea, you can just move it or I can just call the police and they'll give you a ticket.\n\nHim: Hmm, well why don't you just get the fuck off my property you fucking dumbass.\n\nMe: Ha, that's cute, ok then see ya, have a nice night.\n\nI tell my wife about it when I get home and she thinks I was an asshole because it was too late to ring their doorbell and it's not that big of deal, but it's winter and you have to walk in the snow to get past the car. Some context, this is a completely empty residential street so it's not a big deal to walk on the road if needed and I didn't actually call the police to report it since I've never seen them park like that before. I just want to know if I'm justified doing so next time.\n\nNote: The lights were on all throughout the house, it wasn't like the house was totally dark.", "created_utc": 1668783982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yym9xo/aita_for_ringing_neighbors_door_bell_at_midnight/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ringing door bell of neighbor at midnight on weekday \n2.

Just as another user pointed out, those in wheelchairs, walkers, those with difficulty walking, and frankly anyone else could have been seriously injured by attempting to walk through the snow. It was considerate of you to knock on their door rather than immediately calling the police. Considering their response, I\u2019d skip this step if this ever happens again & immediately call the police. \n\nBottom line, they are extremely inconsiderate to park on the sidewalk and they know this. Just as much, they should know that parking like a dumbass risks getting a ticket.", "NTA, it\u2019s fine to call out people when they are in the wrong, you kept it straightforward and didn\u2019t get belligerent. Why should people be able to park on the sidewalk and expect never to hear about it from anyone?", "NTA. I have mobility issues, and having to navigate bs like this has ended in injury more times than I can count.", "So, how boring is your life exactly?", "At Midnight? Seriously? Maybe at 8 am or the middle of the day, but midnight? You're lucky he and everyone in the house didn't come out and throw snowballs at you.

Don't annoy people in the middle of the night\u2014or threaten to tattle to the police\u2014because of the mild inconvenience.\n\nNow, what about people who may be in a wheelchair for whom the car was creating a real obstacle? You have not signaled *at all* that your motivation was to help your disabled neighbors. In other words, had you gone to the house and said \"hey, there's a car blocking the sidewalk and I know there are people in wheelchairs who need access,\" or used words of similar effect, my verdict would be different. As it is, though, you acted as if you wanted the car moved because you wanted it moved *for you* when it was no legitimate inconvenience *to you*. That's what makes you insufferable.\n\nGoodness, it would have taken you less time to walk around the car than to have the colloquy with your neighbor (who now hates you, BTW).\n\n**EDIT:** Also, you didn't call the police.

I mean, the friend blocked the sidewalk and the house owner didn't say anything.  They've already demonstrated a lack of civic responsibility.

They are suggesting that you should have just let it go. Sometimes life is inconvenient. Sometimes that is because people do obnoxious things.

Very 1st time this has happened, and it's in the middle of the night in an area that is very low-traffic where you could easily walk in the street rather than in the snow. Either leave a note on the windshield (petty) or wait til morning to see how early car is moved or wait for a reasonable time to talk to your neighbor or call city hall (where I live that's who would be contacted) in the morning or better yet just MYOFB.

You cannot park your car on the sidewalk.", "I mean, I get what you're saying but in that context I would skip even waking them up and just go right to calling the police. It's not like the guy was a little over the edge of the driveway and didn't realize. He full on used the sidewalk as a parking spot. Look to see if lights are on and anyone's up.

I've done this sorta thing with my neighbors before and they apologize and have their friend move the car. People really tryna give you a hard time for no reason.", "So you're an adult right? In your experience how well do people take criticism?\n\nEdit: I am confused by the down votes. Do people generally find strangers open to criticism?
