I can't blame the gf for being upset that she's being forced to move out or rehome her cats bc of this situation. I know it's hard to think of the possibility of your kid having allergies when you've never had to deal with them before, but you guys really should have made sure there were no major issues before going forward with moving in.

It is a super sticky situation though, I completely understand that your girlfriend wouldn't want to part ways with the cats.", "I have really bad allergies to animals and asthma and I found 24 hour Claritin and switching my maintenance inhaler brand and started on another nightly prescription for breathing and that really helped! My body also adjusted once it was used to the cat, and having my bedroom be a cat free zone helped. I\u2019m not sure how old your daughter is, but if you change the cats diet + bathing routines to reduce dander, and have your daughter in a cat free room at least for sleeping, and switch meds you can at least say you tried? \nOf course your daughter comes first if these don\u2019t work, and your girlfriend has to understand that a health risk is much more important than living together. You can always have her live nearby but have the cats at her place.", "And it might come to that. I even have reactions around people who live with cats, outside their homes.", "Yeah it just stinks all around, doesn\u2019t it?", "Correct. She lived 2 hours away.

She does the Neti Pot as well.", "If the daughter is having trouble breathing daily doctors would refuse allergy shots, far to dangerous to give it to her. Shots are also not pleasant, trigger allergic reactions on their own, don't always work, and take years to be effective.", "Honestly the thought never occurred to me that she would be so allergic. She\u2019s been around cats in the past, but we\u2019ve never had them in the house. \n\nI feel bad about the cats, it stinks too because I really do like them.

If I hug someone or get in a car with someone that has cat dander it makes me itchy, which isn't as bad as being around a cat or in a house with a cat, but it still sucks. \n- OP:: For now, wash the cats (follow the rules on the bottle about letting them soak for 5m) with some chlorhexidine cat wash to reduce dander, get each room (kitchen, living room, daughters room, bathroom) an air purifier, and put your daughter on a nightly benedryl regimen. Don't allow the cats out of your bedroom. This is a short term 'solution' to give your gf time to re-home herself or the cats. \nNTA because cat allergies can be as deadly as a food or medicine allergy.\n\nETA: for me, liquid benedryl can kind of help with cat allergies, but not pills. My dad has like 10 cats and on the rare occasions that I see him I take a full dose of liquid benedryl first so that when I inevitably start having trouble breathing it's not as severe as it is if I hadn't taken any.", "Also your girlfriend\u2019s mistake, as not all cats get along well with children \u2014 or any new people.", "NTA we're proud of you for sticking up for your daughter.", "NAH. Hopefully, you're able to find a way to work things out.", "There may be additional options. They make shampoos and sprays that remove cat allergen dander.

If they decide to keep dating they can reevaluate the situation once the cats die. I wholeheartedly agree that OP has to put his kid first. I\u2019m a little shocked that they didn\u2019t know about the cat allergy sooner. Did daughter never visit GF\u2019s place before GF moved in? Regardless, yes it\u2019s weird for the GF to be pissed, and yes this could be cause for a breakup. I\u2019m just not a dramatic person and tend to think of things in terms of practicality first.", "This right here, the fact is that this child is running the risk of having an allergen induced asthma attack, and they can be deadly. This situation is cut and dried, the cat's must leave the home and then the home will have to be cleaned and everything laundered.", "No no no no. Full stop. You can\u2019t fix allergies with medicine\u2026you can sometimes, not always, reduce symptoms, but it\u2019s not a fix. Remove the girlfriend OP. \n\nAs a side note, I developed major breathing and health issues from long term exposure to allergens. Don\u2019t do this to her, please.", "You might want to look into getting allergy shots for her if her allergies are that severe, simply to make things a little easier on her in the future if she ever has to be around a cat. And if she has severe cat allergies, she might have other allergies like environmental allergies to pollen and such that could be helped by allergy shots. When I was young, I got allergy shots mostly because I wanted to have a cat someday, but they ended up helping me in my daily life with my pollen and dust allergies. I'm still somewhat allergic to cats unfortunately, but it's a LOT better now-- I can even pet them a bit if I'm careful not to touch my eyes! \n\nOf course, allergy shots take a long time to become effective and they may not cure the allergy entirely (and they can be expensive because they involve multiple appointments a week for the shots). So it's not really a solution to the situation here; I think the girlfriend's cats definitely need to move out. But, I figured I'd mention it as an option because allergy shots really helped me. I used to have to carry around Kleenexes at school because I was sneezing all the time, even when I was taking allergy medicine, and allergy shots stopped that. (I still need to take the allergy medicine, but it's a lot more effective now.)\n\nAlso, for stuff like a stuffy nose, Flonase has a newish version called Sensimist that's really good. It's expensive but you can get it at Costco. Even a less expensive nasal spray can help a lot with nasal symptoms, though. Although they're not so good for stuff like itchy/puffy eyes.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, just figured that some of my experience as an allergy sufferer might help!", "If you haven\u2019t tried Allegra give it a shot. I find it stronger than other OTC products. That said, she may need something prescription and I\u2019d definitely try to get those cats removed ASAP.", "Yes, worst case scenario is possible . Cat dander is extremely sticky. There have been studies that found cat dander in the house two years later.", "Cat dander can be extremely difficult to get rid of, just washing isn't enough. I have cat allergies as well and my record is 30 washes of a pair of pants that had been in a house with a cat, I still had to keep them in a bag outside or I would get hives.\n\nStart with a good deep cleaning of your entire house and see how your daughters allergies are. If they don't go away then you may need to move onto replacing things. If the cats have spent much time in your daughters room there is a good chance you will at least need to replace her mattress and pillows.", "Don't put your child on meds so you can live with your gf who doesn't seem to care that your daughter's health is compromised by her cats. Imagine if you had kids with your gf; her/your new kids would ALWAYS come first to your daughter, just like she puts her cats first. Just visit until her cats are gone and then revisit the situation. Or get a new girlfriend that actually cares about your daughter.", "I wasn't aware of these issues, thank you for the education. I follow a well known cat rescuer who swears by the shots they take which are apparently so helpful for them. I wasn't aware they cause side effects.", "You are a good parent. Your gf is a good cat parent too. She can't really abandon or re-home older kitties. This is sad but you both need to do what is right. It's your GF's choice to still see you or not after this.

Make sure you tell the GF how much you care for her and would have preferred to wake up next to her every day or whatever you love about living together but that you wouldn't force her to be uncomfortable either. Tell her you are glad she is such a great cat mom or something else that is also 100%true that you love and admire about her.

I have to take a handful of meds every day and my symptoms are getting worse as I get older. He caused irreparable damage even though he stopped when I was 12 and the asthma \"went away\" immediately at that time my lungs are like a 2 pack a day smoker now. It may cause problems later in life if she keeps getting exposed", "I agree with top comment, but while GF and kitties are still in the house, get a HEPA filter for your daughter's room and another for the livingroom. I'm allergic to cats but allowed my daughter to have one (I love them, and the little rescue we now have) and the filters, plus regular grooming of our cat, helps.

My brother took them for a few months, he stopped after having an anaphylactic reaction. That's also why doctors won't give them to someone who is already not feeling well or having an allergic reaction, the risk is too high.", "NAH so long as your GF ultimately accepts this, and soon, frankly.\n\nNobody knew, nobody was trying to hurt anybody.  Nobody did anything wrong.\n\nI 100% agree that your GF should not get rid of her cats, especially seniors she's had so long.  That would be terrible for them and for her.  She loves them and is responsible for them.  \n\nBut it's also 100% true that you *need* to remove what turns out to be a serious allergen from your daughter's environment.  Your child's health and safety *must* be your first priority.\n\nUnfortunately, this does also mean that your girlfriend can't live with you right now.  She's understandably upset about that.  But this isn't assholery, it's just the reality.  And it sucks, on several levels.  It does.  This is a big relationship step, and it's often the best arrangement financially, too. \n\nThis is an expectation you guys had which you're now having to adjust to having to put on hold for the foreseeable future.
