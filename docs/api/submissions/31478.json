We just had our first baby 5 months ago and I'm currently a stay at home mom. Everyday when our son naps I'm doing laundry, cleaning, and organizing the house. Chris is a Journeyman plumber and works 8 hours a day and is off every weekend and doesn't lift a finger unless it's in the garage. Tonight I asked him if he could please wash one bottle for me for the morning and I would clean the rest when I put the baby down for his first nap tomorrow because I was just to exhausted to do anything else. He said why cant you do it? That's literally your job since I work all day. I was floored I do everything in the house, workout, pump every 2 hours, and take care of the baby and I was asking to much just to wash a single bottle? I proceeded to wash all the bottles and go to bed without another word. He comes to bed and asks if I'm mad at him I say I'm just disappointed he would think I don't do anything while he's at work he responds with ugh whatever. Am I overreacting? I feel like it was an asshole thing to say to me when I really try so hard to be a good wife and mother it's all so overwhelming sometimes.

I hope you show him these NTA replies to your post. \n\nIt's hard to ask for help or a small favor knowing you're going to get turned down, and it's hurtful to a relationship. \n\nYou both deserve equal time \"off the clock\" so ask him when your leisure time is. That needs to be part of a larger conversation you have with him, and you need to have it sooner rather than later. Do NOT let him off the hook for this. You need a co-parent. Now.

And its women divorcing men because: The man doesnt act as a partner and help out. \n\nAsk any divorce attorney. Its true.\n\nMen think that they can go to a job, come home, watch football or play video games while their wife is doing three or four jobs by being the housekeeper, being the chef, being the child care provider and then also they expect you after all of that to have enough energy to have sex with them at the end of the day.  \n\nYou need to make your husband realize that there are housekeepers who get paid full-time to be housekeepers and there are personal chefs who get paid full-time to be a personal chef and there are people who are nannies or provide daycare who get paid full time to provide the services . \n\nSo you are doing the job of multiple people and not getting paid for it while he is doing one job for eight hours . When you as the mother of a child are on call 24 hours a day. \n\nI would suggest writing out a list of each of those jobs, and exactly what each of those jobs entails like just for example cooking . Sounds simple. Sounds like just one thing, but this is what it actually is.:\n\nMeal Planning (and being that you\u2019re young and he\u2019s only a journeyman plumber and considering the cost of living you\u2019re probably Meal Planning on a budget -which means you are having to take into consideration the sales and deals of a variety of stores when you make a grocery list and then you have to go get groceries from a variety of different locations.)\n\nThen you have to go throughout the house and make a list of all of the shit that you need for your grocery list. You then have to pack up the baby and go to the grocery store and buy all of the groceries.  Then you have to bring all the groceries in the house and put all the groceries away. Then you have to process the food that you just bought the fruits and vegetables or the meat and do food prep for the week. You have to cook three meals a day seven days a week. Then you also have to do the dishes for three meals a day, seven days a week. And also clean the kitchen area after each meal is cooked.\n\nNext lets look at laundry, \nIf you have a baby, you\u2019re probably doing a lot of laundry. You have to get your laundry, his laundry, and the babies laundry -then you have to sort the laundry.  Then you have to wash and dry multiple loads of laundry then you have to fold the laundry then you have to put all the laundry away. This takes ALOT of time.\n\nAnd I could go on and on about what it takes to efficiently clean a house . But I think that you get the picture. Breakdown what each of these tasks actually looks like in your house so that he understands how much work actually goes into these things.. \n\nThe food doesn\u2019t magically appear in the fridge or magically appear on his plate . The clean clothes don\u2019t magically appear in the closet.. \n\nNot to mention, you\u2019re doing all of this and taking care of a baby how who has multiple feeding and diaper changing needs throughout the day. \n\nEven if you\u2019re a stay at home mom, that\u2019s not an excuse for him to do one job or you\u2019re doing multiple jobs . He goes to a job for eight hours a day and gets a lunch break. Your home with the baby all day you get no break and you\u2019re on call 24 hours like you need to make this dude realize the level of effort that all of this takes.", "Your husband is an AH clinging to archaic views on gender roles. \n\nHe works all day? So do you.", "NTA. You can\u2019t do two things at once, so I would offer him a choice of washing the bottle or taking care of the baby while you wash the bottles in the evening. It\u2019s socially acceptable for more dads to be involved now than in the past, so I would bring up his unwillingness to help out in front of any dad friends he has to see what they think.

Otherwise he won't have a clue what to do.\n\nYou feed the baby and nothing else. When you have fed him give him back to your husband. Shut yourself away or take walks /coffee shop visits between feeds.\n\nHe must change his attitude and behaviour or this relationship is unsustainable.", "NTA\n\nHe works a 9-5 and thinks he's entitled to a break while you work a 24/7 job.

He benefits exponentially from you being home. My husband and I went through that early on where he thought it should all be my job. It took years and him changing to day shift for him to realize how much I do alone. Idk why it takes so long to sink in. Anyway, an itemized list of all the services you perform in the home with costs and stopping or doing the bare minimum might help. At the very least, schedule yourself time out with friends or juat by yourself and leave the baby with him. Leave instructions. Tell him not to call unless it's an emergency. The first time my husband was left alone with our first baby for an hour, he hugged me so tightly when I got back. I kind of chuckled at how hard it was for him. Told him to think how I feel doing that during his shifts at work plus everything else. Hopefully, your husband gets it.

If I got sick, he didn't care. If HE was ill, he'd stay home on the couch and demand I keep kids quiet in their rooms.  BTW, he was a store manager for a major retail store, he did not have a grueling laborious work day. \n\nI say all this to warn you that a man with that mindset will never be your partner.

Tonight I asked him if he could please wash one bottle for me for the morning and I would clean the rest when I put the baby down for his first nap tomorrow because I was just to exhausted to do anything else. He said why cant you do it? That's literally your job since I work all day. I was floored I do everything in the house, workout, pump every 2 hours, and take care of the baby and I was asking to much just to wash a single bottle? I proceeded to wash all the bottles and go to bed without another word. He comes to bed and asks if I'm mad at him I say I'm just disappointed he would think I don't do anything while he's at work he responds with ugh whatever. Am I overreacting? I feel like it was an asshole thing to say to me when I really try so hard to be a good wife and mother it's all so overwhelming sometimes.

Both parents interact with and care for the child when they are there, otherwise a child has a single parent who happens to be married to a stranger.\n\nMy example of this: my hubs works 5:30am to 6pm every day, sat and sun off *sometimes*. Men with big machines can be fucky so sometimes he doesn't even get Saturdays or Sundays off and he's on call 24/7. Yet he does the cooking, he helps clean, and he helps take care of the kids. He does bath time for all three, helps put them to bed, helps care for them when they're sick, etc. that's what is expected of a parent, stay at home or not. Washing ONE bottle is not too much to ask.", "Maybe this will help you understand: her job is being a stay at home mum, and his is being a plumber. They both do this 5 days a week, 8 hours a day.\nThe rest of the time, they are both parents, and they both look after the household.\nMum is expected to fill her days while husband is plumbing with looking after the baby and doing household work. \nWhat cannot be done during the time husband is away needs to be shared once working time is over.\nThis is how it's fair.\nIf husband does more hours, then he will be home less and will do less household work and parenting. \n(If course this is a marriage and not a business arrangement, so they will take into account personal circumstances, e.g if one of them is poorly, the other will do more)", "with this attitude, don't be surprised that it will end up in divorce and kids will be 24/7 with mom after the separation. \n\nMen don't realize that contributing more in raising their children and managing the household also contributes to their chances of seeing their children more when it all falls apart.. \n\nMen not contributing to small requests in managing the household is the #1 reason why women get a divorce. Like, if you cannot even wash a bottle when your wife expects the bare minimum, are you truly a partner?", "No. Stay at home mom is childcare. You want a maid? Hire one.", "They're saying a SAHM cannot be a full-time job, if single parents can work AND take care of their child & house", "and if she were single, she would have to work full time and take care of the kid and house?? \n\nyeah i agree its not a special status, but if shes not working and literally is home all day, she can wash the dishes ffs", "then whats her problem? mum has a role, dad has a role. just do them", ">But how? Nothing changed for me,\n\nYou had a child.", "It's not the same as a second salary.", "Plus taking care of an infant? That doesn\u2019t factor into the equation? Also you have no idea how much the chores multiply with a baby. Extra dishes, extra laundry, extra everything.", "Which he would already have to do while single. Her work load would lighten without him and his would get much more. What does that tell you", "He's doing a 40 hour a week job with weekends off. He isn't doing any cooking, cleaning or childcare whatsoever. So he's doing far less than the average single adult. \n\nI work 40 hours a week and am married with kids. The idea that I would do nothing all weekend every weekend and expect someone else to cook, clean and take care of my kid that entire time because of that 40 hours is laughable and ridiculous.", "My son didn\u2019t sleep well until he was 9. He didn\u2019t sleep through the night for years. He\u2019s still likely to wake up at 5am.", "Almost everyone has worked a full-time job. You are not special, perhaps just bad at your job.", "It takes two to make a baby, it takes two to care for a baby.", "It isn't the list! It's the preparation of the list. \n\nWe don't hold an inventory of every item in the house. \n\nDid you even read my reply or simply choose the one sentence that makes us look incompetent?", "He would still have to cook dinner if he was divorced....", "But she's also been doing something incredibly physically exhausting all day too...  As someone who has had several children and been at home with them and also at separate times had a full time very physically demanding job with 11 hour shifts, I genuinely found looking after the baby more physically exhausting and demanding. Especially with breastfeeding which really does take it out of you and can be a constant thing plus you usually get very little sleep as a mum", "I mean, he didn't even have to do that. How OP manages with a 5 month old I cannot imagine.", "Well then he\u2019s really gonna have to cook his own dinner\u2026and also do his own laundry\u2026", "Yeah it suck\u2019s single parents have to do it all, but if you\u2019re not a single parent why should you have to operate like one? Why is mom expected to operate like a single parent but not dad? Lots of dads work 8 hours a day then come home to raise their kid on their own and this guy can\u2019t even wash a single bottle?", "No, just a single parent dosent have someone to share child care and chores after work hours. So, exactly what OP is currently doing.", "Every working adult also has to cook and clean. That is a basic human requirement. She obviously takes on the vast majority of that for him. \n\nBut one paid job is not enough to get you out of literally 100% of that responsibility. Refusing to do ANYTHING for the household, even wash one measly bottle, is not an even trade for having one job like every other adult. Maybe if you are in a position where you have to work two jobs or you're working 24 hour shifts at a hospital, you can get more slack. But a basic job you would have regardless? Nah. \n\nWhen I was the only one working I couldn't even have imagined having the audacity to come home every day and sit on my ass to the point that I was not willing to wash a single bottle. I came home, had some decompression time and then participated in the cooking, cleaning and childcare like a functional family member.", "If she were single, he\u2019d have the same job and have to take care of his own child during his custody time. \n\nStay at home mom hours are the same as job hours, once he\u2019s home and they\u2019re both \u201cclocked out\u201d, it should be a joint effort.", "Because at 5 he gets to clock out. When does she get time off? A sick day? A bonus?", "Because it\u2019s his house and baby too lol. Don\u2019t have a kid if you\u2019re not willing to take shifts to care for them", "So mum gets to work 24/7 with no breaks and dad works 8-5 with weekends off? Tell me how that's fair. He's a parent to his child, he should start acting like it.\n\nThe house is shared, the child is shared, therefore when dad is done work for the day he should be pulling his weight around the home with his family. The division of labor is not equal right now.", "She works 7 days a week, he works 5. My dad was the traditional breadwinner and my mom was a SAHM, it was understood that he would play an equal role on weekends with cooking and taking care of me. Doesn't sound like that's the case here. \n\nAnd especially since this is a baby and she's still pumping, he gets full nights of sleep and she doesn't. She works far more hours each week than he does any way you slice it.", "Why is dad's role 40 hours a week and moms 24/7, are you 13 or and shit dad?\n\nSide note she probably has a job, she's on maternity leave..", "Yeah I meant regarding workload since the person I answered to claims that somehow going to work for 8h is suddenly harder when your spouse isn\u2019t doing the same. \n\nBtw this is a hypothetical scenario. But I was curious what justification the other person would come up because I see this claim a lot", "Depending where you are and what your job is, it can be: https://blog.dol.gov/2023/01/24/new-childcare-data-shows-prices-are-untenable-for-families\n\nAnd that's not even getting into how hard it can be to find safe, reliable childcare. If you didn't get onto a waiting list early in the pregnancy, you may have to wait 9 months or more to get a spot with a decent place.", "In America, the average starting salary for a nanny is $30k a year. So you\u2019re right, \u201cit\u2019s not the same as a second income\u201d because it\u2019s actually more. \n\nhttps://www.care.com/c/average-nanny-salary-by-state/", "If she was single her work load would be a lot worse as she would have to get a full time job and take care of the child.", "yes i read it lol, you still said what you said and its funny", "Exfuckingactly! Men literally think they're entitled to a bang maid, a private cook, a double fill time nanny, a personal accountant, and a home administrative assistant because they go to work. Newsflash, they'd go to work and do all that shit themselves if they weren't married. The sthm/wife is earning her keep six times over, why can't they do 1/4 of the tasks in the household? The math ain't mathin!", "At least you wouldn't have to deal with the bitching.", "Nope. \n\nI look after my 20 month old all day. \nCompared to a real physically demanding job, it\u2019s a piece of piss. \n\nToday we got up, had breakfast, walked to Starbucks and then went to soft play. At the moment he\u2019s eating his dinner, then it\u2019s off to the park. \n\nYou think that compares to a tough job? It\u2019s mentally draining sometimes but it\u2019s not physically difficult.", "Oh yes, the laundry that is so difficult when you have a machine that does it for you. Or the dishes that are so difficult when you have a machine that does it for you. Or how about the floors that are so difficult to clean? Oh wait you have a machine that does that for you.", "Nobody is arguing that a mother is one of the most important roles and one of the most difficult but that does not mean that just because the guy clocks out at 5 he is somehow way better off than her.\n\nShe does not have to deal with a knob-head boss.  She does not have to deal with crappy clients or soul-destroying co-workers.  The dreaded work commute.  Work politics and all the drama that goes with that.   Work is not always done at 5. He said he is a plumber, so I am assuming he gets callouts at night.  The work can be back breaking without air-conditioning.  I mean the list goes on and on.    I feel for Op but let's not kid ourselves. Working a 9-5 also has its own bullcrap especially in the trades.  I did plumber work for a while and most days I could not stand on my feet after a hard day. \n\nI agree he could be more involved but to think only the woman is having a difficult time is absurd.", "Ok so maybe the mum should go back to worker and they hire a nanny, easily would be able to afford it with the second income.\n\nExcept that's never that popular with sah advocates, because it's easier.", "Yeah, I do as well. It's infuriating. Like adding a while ass human to the household who requires constant care for the first year of its life isn't a huge change. Ugh.", "I stand by what I said. Writing a list and doing all the thought and prep behind the list to then hand a list over to someone who is supposed to be lightening your list is exhausting. \n\nI bet theae same people who need someone to write them a list then also will ring from the shop asking 300 questions about items on the list.", "Agreed, she will be much happier without an extra child to parent.", "100% depends on the specific baby", "Your 20 month old isn\u2019t as demanding as an infant \n\nAn almost 2 year old can have supervised independent play. Hell even if you were still nursing at 20 months that\u2019s no where near as frequent as what OP is currently doing because an almost 2 year old isn\u2019t nursing every 4-6 hours", "If it's so easy to do those things, then should be easy to do his share", "Lol he was just asked to wash a bottle.", "Yeah, she just has to deal with a  husband who can\u2019t be bothered to wash a single bottle FOR HIS OWN CHILD. \n\nDon\u2019t have kids if you\u2019re not willing to do the work that goes with it.", "You clearly either don\u2019t have kids or you\u2019re a sexist asshole.", "He still gets time off from his job. Sounds like she's expected to be the only parent *all the time*. If you've never had to do that, and if you've never experienced the damage that a normal, healthy pregnancy can do to your body, you have *no idea*. My husband worked for his family's logging operation as a young man, bit I'm the one with a wrecked body in spite of working white-collar jobs since age 21. That wrecked body is courtesy of my kids. Stop acting like he somehow deserves to keep his non-work time sacred when she is easily doing a job that is just as hard and *she has no time off*.", "Not just childcare, they\u2019d also have to hire a 24 hour day cleaner, cook and personal assistant to cover everything OP is currently does. \n\nAlso, when was the last time you hired a nanny? I\u2019m going to guess it\u2019s been a very long time, if ever. Otherwise you\u2019d know that even with two incomes, hiring a nanny isn\u2019t easy and affordable.", "You don't know how expensive childcare is, do you? $1000/month is cheap for infant care, and that's daycare prices, not nanny prices. So you still have to take care of the kiddo nights and weekends.", "You don't have any idea how expensive child care is do you? I'm not even a parent and I know that it's sometimes more expensive than staying at home. Smh. \n\nYou realize paying a nanny would be paying someone's entire salary. With the entire salary being made by OP? You don't see how that's not actually saving anything?", "Your right, it is a lot easier than finding someone you don't know to care for your child 8hrs/day. And to be able to afford a decent one at that, even with two incomes.", "No, because OP would be working just to put their child in daycare. It's really fucking expensive and, unless she is a single parent with a really shitty job, she won't qualify for cheap daycare programs subsidized by the government. \n\nI have never met a sahp that wasn't desperate to get out of the house and do literally anything, dreaming of the days they worked in food service. But they can't because the child needs them there, and there is too much work to do around the house to take an actual break. \n\nWe are talking about a baby. That's feeding time every 4-6 hours, depending on their age. And if you are breastfeeding, that's taking time to make sure you are healthy and fit enough to produce substantial milk. So, making full meals for breakfast and lunch and exercising on top of dinner for you and your husband. Cleaning everything, every day. \n\nThere is bath time, putting the child down for a nap (which they don't all love doing), the kid getting sick and dealing with that nightmarish situation. Going to the store with a baby takes at least twice as long. \n\nLook, you may be trolling or you may actually believe what your saying. But being a sahp isn't an easy job. When done properly, there is no sitting around watching TV. Its a lack of sleep, working all hours of the day. It may not be a traditional physically demanding job, but it wears down your strength because you are not giving your body a rest. \n\nIt can be a rewarding job, being there to watch your child grow up. And it gets easier as they grow up. But, not when they are a baby.", "That\u2019s my husband", "And he will be better without an extra child to provide for.", "Unless it\u2019s a particularly difficult baby, which OP didn\u2019t mention, I\u2019d disagree.", "I\u2019ve been his main care giver since birth. \nSpent the first 3 month looking after him alone whilst his mum was in hospital after him being born.\n\nI\u2019m not denying it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not what\u2019s being made out in this thread though. \nI doubt the people saying it\u2019s as hard as a physically demanding job have ever had a physically demanding job.", "Isn't it glorious how we completely discount how difficult providing for a family as in modern society? \n\n\"Do his share\", he did his share when he went to work and sucked his bosses dick for 12 hours working a dead end job, busting his knuckles on steel, getting covered in cancer causing oils. \n\nOh but she breastfed and changed diapers, what a hero. God you people make me sick.", "Hence why I said he can be more involved.  I just commented on the previous commenter.  Trying to make it sound like the guy is just chilling 24/7 and the OP is doing slave labor.", "Lol, okay buddy.  You contributed nothing with your comment, and I will treat it as such.", "Yeah cos men never complain about the amount of child support and alimony that they have to pay. And he would have to actually parent his own child if he planned on maintaining a relationship with them, which is obviously so easy to do, even when working and keeping house \ud83d\ude02", "Let me guess, you're not married", "Are you for real? Have you ever taken care of an infant? I bet not, because otherwise you would not be saying that bullshit. Husbands today work full time jobs AND contribute at home, because they know how being a SAHP is much more than a full time job. Much much more.", "Lol k, like women aren't vindictive and rape men over the coals every day."]}
