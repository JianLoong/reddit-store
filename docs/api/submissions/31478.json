We just had our first baby 5 months ago, and I'm currently a stay at home mom. Every day, when our son naps, I'm doing laundry, cleaning, and organizing the house. Chris is a Journeyman plumber and works 8 hours a day and is off every weekend and doesn't lift a finger unless it's in the garage. Tonight I asked him if he could please wash one bottle for me for the morning and I would clean the rest when I put the baby down for his first nap tomorrow because I was just to exhausted to do anything else. He said why cant you do it?\" That's literally your job since I work all day. I was floored. I do everything in the house, work out, pump every 2 hours, and take care of the baby, and I was asking too much just to wash a single bottle? I proceeded to wash all the bottles and go to bed without another word. He comes to bed and asks if I'm mad at him I say I'm just disappointed he would think I don't do anything while he's at work he responds with ugh whatever. Am I overreacting? I feel like it was an asshole thing to say to me when I really try so hard to be a good wife and mother it's all so overwhelming sometimes. Thank you for any comments and advice.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, my post was so vague. I know my husband has reddit, but I don't know if he's on this page. I'm going to answer a few questions:\n He wasn't like this before we had our son we spilt the workload 50/50. It's just started since being at home.\nI have an at home business, so he is not the sole breadwinner.\nI'm a Journeyman welder, so I do know how hard trade work can be. This post wasn't discrediting how hard he works.\nHe is involved with our son when he's home from work by doing the fun stuff, not so much the core like stuff \n( feeding, diapers ect.)\nHe doesn't do yard work.\nOur son is colicky and is a velcro baby, so my day is a lot of screaming and holding him. I do my best to multi task and get stuff done, but sometimes it's too much.\n\nI hope that answers some questions. Thank you to all that have commented andice and experiences. I appreciate it!\n\n", "created_utc": 1700634177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1812na9/aita_for_being_frustrated_with_my_husband_for/", "score": 1099, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has a kid and a home. Working doesn't exempt you from care work. Remind him that if you decide to split over this, he would have to work, take care of his own home, take care of the baby on his own and probably would have to pay child support. Washing one bottle (or in general stepping up as a husband and father) is nothing compared to what he'd have to do if you were not in the picture.

He regretted his decision after about a month and I just didn\u2019t want to forgive him at the time.

At the moment, you\u2019re working 24/7, while he works a mere eight hours a day five days a week. He needs to step up and do his part in parenting his child.

I hope you show him these NTA replies to your post. \n\nIt's hard to ask for help or a small favor knowing you're going to get turned down, and it's hurtful to a relationship. \n\nYou both deserve equal time \"off the clock\" so ask him when your leisure time is. That needs to be part of a larger conversation you have with him, and you need to have it sooner rather than later. Do NOT let him off the hook for this. You need a co-parent. Now. Before he just starts expecting you to do everything all the time forever. That's an unreasonable and unfair burden on you. Do NOT put up with it.\n\nIn the moment, it's hard to think of the right thing to say when someone brushes off your request so surprisingly rudely. But if he asks you why again, say, \"I'm tied up at the moment, and your support would mean a lot to me.\" Don't cave, do it yourself, and give him the silent treatment. \n\nYou need to find a way to build in some down time for yourself every week or you are going to burn out and start resenting him so hard your relationship might not recover. So hash it out. Get him on the same page. Pull in other dads to set him straight if he won't listen to you. Good luck!", "NTA he has to work whether or not you're at home. It's a poor excuse.

So many men think working and providing $$ is all they have to do. That might fly 2 generations ago, but that doesn\u2019t fly now! After working a regular shift (8hrs), he needs to come home and do 50% of duties at home. Why do you work 24hr shifts and mofo works 8?! You need to have a serious talk with him.

He works 8 hours per weekday. You work those same 8 hours on domestic tasks. Everything outside of those 38 hours per week you split/share as a couple. You are both parents. You are both contributing to the household in your own ways. You don't \"owe\" him for \"providing\" for you by having to become a 24/7 slave. In fact, I bet he couldn't even afford you. Could he afford to pay you for full time nanny/after school care/maid services? Could he afford a private chef? Cleaner to come in every day? \n\nHe needs to sort himself out immediately and stop treating you like the help. If not, honestly, leave. It isn't worth it.

But at my current job, I work 10 hr shifts 4 days a week and at my old job I work 10 hr shifts 5 days a week and 4 hrs on Saturday. Welding until work slows down.

And its women divorcing men because: The man doesnt act as a partner and help out. \n\nAsk any divorce attorney. Its true.\n\nMen think that they can go to a job, come home, watch football or play video games while their wife is doing three or four jobs by being the housekeeper, being the chef, being the child care provider and then also they expect you after all of that to have enough energy to have sex with them at the end of the day.  \n\nYou need to make your husband realize that there are housekeepers who get paid full-time to be housekeepers and there are personal chefs who get paid full-time to be a personal chef and there are people who are nannies or provide daycare who get paid full time to provide the services . \n\nSo you are doing the job of multiple people and not getting paid for it while he is doing one job for eight hours . When you as the mother of a child are on call 24 hours a day. \n\nI would suggest writing out a list of each of those jobs, and exactly what each of those jobs entails like just for example cooking . Sounds simple. Sounds like just one thing, but this is what it actually is.:\n\nMeal Planning (and being that you\u2019re young and he\u2019s only a journeyman plumber and considering the cost of living you\u2019re probably Meal Planning on a budget -which means you are having to take into consideration the sales and deals of a variety of stores when you make a grocery list and then you have to go get groceries from a variety of different locations.)\n\nThen you have to go throughout the house and make a list of all of the shit that you need for your grocery list. You then have to pack up the baby and go to the grocery store and buy all of the groceries.  Then you have to bring all the groceries in the house and put all the groceries away. Then you have to process the food that you just bought the fruits and vegetables or the meat and do food prep for the week. You have to cook three meals a day seven days a week. Then you also have to do the dishes for three meals a day, seven days a week. And also clean the kitchen area after each meal is cooked.\n\nNext lets look at laundry, \nIf you have a baby, you\u2019re probably doing a lot of laundry. You have to get your laundry, his laundry, and the babies laundry -then you have to sort the laundry.  Then you have to wash and dry multiple loads of laundry then you have to fold the laundry then you have to put all the laundry away. This takes ALOT of time.\n\nAnd I could go on and on about what it takes to efficiently clean a house . But I think that you get the picture. Breakdown what each of these tasks actually looks like in your house so that he understands how much work actually goes into these things.. \n\nThe food doesn\u2019t magically appear in the fridge or magically appear on his plate . The clean clothes don\u2019t magically appear in the closet.. \n\nNot to mention, you\u2019re doing all of this and taking care of a baby how who has multiple feeding and diaper changing needs throughout the day. \n\nEven if you\u2019re a stay at home mom, that\u2019s not an excuse for him to do one job or you\u2019re doing multiple jobs . He goes to a job for eight hours a day and gets a lunch break. Your home with the baby all day you get no break and you\u2019re on call 24 hours like you need to make this dude realize the level of effort that all of this takes.", "Your husband is an AH clinging to archaic views on gender roles. \n\nHe works all day? So do you.", "NTA. You can\u2019t do two things at once, so I would offer him a choice of washing the bottle or taking care of the baby while you wash the bottles in the evening. It\u2019s socially acceptable for more dads to be involved now than in the past, so I would bring up his unwillingness to help out in front of any dad friends he has to see what they think. If he hears that his buddies change the odd diaper or wash the occasional bottle, he may start stepping up too.", "NTA. When he's home after work he needs to patent snd do chores. If he works 8 hrs/day, he can't expect you to be on call 24/7 because that's ridiculous. \n\nHe needs to cook and do dishes, laundry, etc some of the time.", "nta your husband needs to step up and support you, being a parent is a joint effort and you're doing so much already.", "NTA\n\nRecommend asking him to spend one day doing all the work you do.\n\nTake a day and record every single job you do - write it in a list. Otherwise he won't have a clue what to do.\n\nYou feed the baby and nothing else. When you have fed him give him back to your husband. Shut yourself away or take walks /coffee shop visits between feeds.\n\nHe must change his attitude and behaviour or this relationship is unsustainable.", "NTA\n\nHe works a 9-5 and thinks he's entitled to a break while you work a 24/7 job.

I went back to work a year ago because we couldn't swing it on one income anymore with multiple kids. All that to say while staying home is a privilege it's not just your privilege. He benefits exponentially from you being home. My husband and I went through that early on where he thought it should all be my job. It took years and him changing to day shift for him to realize how much I do alone. Idk why it takes so long to sink in. Anyway, an itemized list of all the services you perform in the home with costs and stopping or doing the bare minimum might help. At the very least, schedule yourself time out with friends or juat by yourself and leave the baby with him. Leave instructions. Tell him not to call unless it's an emergency. The first time my husband was left alone with our first baby for an hour, he hugged me so tightly when I got back. I kind of chuckled at how hard it was for him. Told him to think how I feel doing that during his shifts at work plus everything else. Hopefully, your husband gets it.

Sit him down and tell him that just because you're home all day doesn't mean you're not working, just because he's working a job doesn't mean he's the only one allowed to be tired, and it certainly doesn't mean that he is allowed to not do chores around *his* house.", "NTA.

Tonight I asked him if he could please wash one bottle for me for the morning and I would clean the rest when I put the baby down for his first nap tomorrow because I was just to exhausted to do anything else. He said why cant you do it? That's literally your job since I work all day. I was floored I do everything in the house, workout, pump every 2 hours, and take care of the baby and I was asking to much just to wash a single bottle? I proceeded to wash all the bottles and go to bed without another word. He comes to bed and asks if I'm mad at him I say I'm just disappointed he would think I don't do anything while he's at work he responds with ugh whatever. Am I overreacting?

Men with big machines can be fucky so sometimes he doesn't even get Saturdays or Sundays off and he's on call 24/7. Yet he does the cooking, he helps clean, and he helps take care of the kids. He does bath time for all three, helps put them to bed, helps care for them when they're sick, etc. that's what is expected of a parent, stay at home or not.
