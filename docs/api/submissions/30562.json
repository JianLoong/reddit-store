Many. Stupid. Excuses.  I'd cancel and get dinner with my husband and tell them why. \"", "They can't cover their own travel expenses?  Nta", "NTA. Tell them if they can't figure out how to get there without you, you are canceling the dinner. When they complain a second later, say \"You're right, this is too complicated. Lets just cancel it.\"", "NTA\n\nCancel the party and celebrate with your partner and kid.", "NTA. It\u2019s your party, you don\u2019t have to drive them anywhere. They\u2019re all adults and can find their own way there abs back.", "NTA - Tell everyone to find their own way and you and the fianc\u00e9 take an uber.", "NTA.  Tell everyone involved that they are responsible for getting their own self to the dinner and you, nor your partner, are their designated drivers.  If they insist, just don't show up.   \nLet them sit on the couch waiting for a ride that isn't going to happen.  That's what taxis, Uber and Lyft is for and if they're so damn cheap they don't want to pay for one, that's also on their selfish, greedy selves.  Congrats on your engagement!", "NTA\n\nI'll be another person to tell you that you are NOT a horrible person.  They are adults, they need to find their own way like ADULTS.  You mention Taxi--so clearly that is an option.  \n\nOne option--Do you trust your dad with your car?  Could he drive all the non drivers in your car?  If not that's fine, just wanted to put it out there.  (if his car is getting fixed--how is he getting around normally without it and why isn't that his go-to option?)", "NTA, it is for you.  Can you and your partner Uber over, then you don't have to drive nor worry about parking.  And that you will just be taking care of yourselves for the transport.", "Can\u2019t someone else drive your car? Same amount of seats but you as a passenger?", "NTA. Firmly state you will meet them at the venue. Don\u2019t enter into a conversation about it. Tell your family that you will not be driving.", "I feel like you need to tell your family what you said here:\n\n>I feel like everyone else can refuse what ever they want but as soon as I do I\u2019m the worst person in the world according to them? I do set boundaries but no one respects them  \n>  \n>Also this was supposed to be the happiest time of my life just getting engaged to the love of my life but my family is making it so negative and I hate it.\n\nUltimately, what I have learned with age is people don't really change, you can share how inconsiderate they are being and making a party meant for you, about them, but they could just as easily make you feel like dirt because \"well we organized it for you.\" \n\nI'd say the above quotes then say you and your fianc\u00e9 will not be driving or using either of your cars as you plan on drinking so you will be ubering. \n\nI honestly do not get why family blow up such non issues into these huge situations. \n\nCongratulations on your engagement! I will look out for your post on your family causing more issues for YOUR wedding (I wish I was kidding but based of this story I see this happening).", "NTA. But who is paying for this dinner? If they can\u2019t pay for a taxi, are they going to stick you with their bill too? Personally, I would just have dinner with your fianc\u00e9e. You can always have a small party at your house later and serve cake if you feel the need to have a family event.", "NTA & just say, sorry you won't be making it.  I'm taking a taxi/uber myself.  That's it.  Don't let them tell you what you are going to do.  They are telling you they won't drive.  You tell them you aren't driving and they either need to find a ride or skip the party.", "Go in a taxi yourself and let other people sort out your own transport xx \nNTA", "INFO: why won't they pay for a cab/Uber?", "NTA, have some drinks and get yourselves a taxi home, they can sort themselves out", "NTA.  Get an Uber and enjoy yourself.  Everyone else can make their own arrangements for transportation.", "Get yourself an Uber. Of course others aren\u2019t going to respect your boundaries if it does not benefit them. Plain and simple get yourself an Uber. Let them know what you\u2019re doing. No more conversation about the transportation after that. \nThey are on their own to figure that out. They can come or don\u2019t. This is your celebration.", "Repeat after me \"oh...lol... I'm not driving to my party... Lol ... You all can take an Uber if you want. You're all grown ass adults.\"", "NTA, it's simple, tell them they have to find another ride because you are both taking an uber together.", "NTA.", "Super simple. Tell them you are taking a taxi and suggest they do the same. And done.", "Cancel that dinner, the two of you take a cab/lyft/uber to a place of your choice and enjoy the evening.  NTA.", "Half-agree, but leave out the \"other people can share it\".   That gives OP's family an opportunity to be spoilsports by arriving late, asking for last-minute stops on the way, complaining about the taxi...\n\nBut taxi, absolutely.", "Why not a limo?  Check on the costs.  Limo might be more fun.", "I literally said this to my fianc\u00e9 today!!! seriously considering it", "Thank you.", "I will celebrate my Engagement with family how ever I would like to. How did you celebrate your engagement?", "Thank you.", "I am not a drinker, I thought I would go all out and have a glass of wine with dinner for my engagement party!! Can you please tell me the issue with that?", "I totally understand that! However, it\u2019s not about the alcohol to be honest I definitely worded it wrong in my post.", "This is my kind of level of petty, lmao", "Why not a hot air balloon?", "Holy shit I would have left my own wedding after the vows; my husband would have been very happy with leaving, too. That's ridiculous.", "Think because someone needs to watch the son I think. I'm not sure.", "Let them think that\u2014 you don\u2019t have to attend every guilt trip to which you are invited. Without you and your partner (congratulations), there is _no party_.", "They are only doing that, so their own shitty behaviour doesn't get called out. \n\nTake a taxi, have a good night and a couple of drinks AND DO NOT PAY FOR ANYYHING IF YOUR FAMILY TRY TO MALE YOU COVER THE BILL, better yet leave before the cheque arrives just to be safe, it sounds like your family might try to host this party but try to make you cover the bill.", "If they're going to be like that I would dip on the entire thing. F that. They're making it clear it's not even about you and your fiance, it's all about them. Spent that night with your son and fiance and enjoy a drink and the peace of not entertaining selfish AHs.\n\nNTA.", "You are NTA!  Do not allow them to make you feel bad <3  You and your fianc\u00e9e should be free to have a toast or a cocktail during the celebration!  Take a cab or Uber, and everyone else needs to be left to their own devices!!", "I guess then I\u2019m completely confused as to what the problem is? \n\nBut I do really hope that you can get things worked out and have a wonderful time \u2764\ufe0f", "I like the way you two think!", "I'm in the camp of simply stating \"We are taking a taxi / rideshare\" and ending it there. They are in no way responsible for others' transportation by any means. If no one comes because they can't/won't pony up to get themselves there, that's on them. There is no reason they need to sponge off of OP and partner - there are plenty of others they could share rides with in OTHER taxi's or ride shares.", "<<space in your taxi for 2 people who can get to your house by given time.>> \n\nHow do you expect them to get to OP's house?  Matter transporter?  If they have a way to OP's house, they have way to restaurant.", "It was an after party, we had a small gathering at a restaurant before and got tricked going there afterwards.  We indeed did not stay long. MIL was horrified when she learnt the reason why we didn't want a party, she truly thought it was for costs and genuinely apologized. The others... Well they got their party, it's been 2 years I'm not expecting anything lol but I'm always very suspicious when I'm invited to stuffs to them. It actually happened a few times afterwards that the gathering I'm invited to is way more ppl I was told lol.", "My problem was the fact my family expected me and my partner to drive every one there and back when it was a special meal for us, and got mad when we didn\u2019t want to! It\u2019s their reaction, making me feel bad about it and them being entitled, was my problem. \n\nAnd thank you very much, I really hope so too \u2764\ufe0f", "that's totally reasonable.", "Then this is just where we vary. You knew your dad\u2019s car was in the shop and you sister doesn\u2019t drive so I would have automatically been making sure they had a ride or offering. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
