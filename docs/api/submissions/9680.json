Then, as we got accepted to college, I went to the west-coast to pursue my degree and she stayed in our home-state to pursue a degree at the state college.\n\nWhile we tried to stay in contact, we quickly lost touch with each other and didn't talk with one another for just over a decade. During this period, we started our own lives, I got married & had 2 children with my lovely husband and she was living happily on the east-coast.\n\nNevertheless, one day, she finds my number and calls me, says she is moving to the west-coast (specifically my city), and asks me if I would like to catch-up. I said of course and I invite her to my home. We have a great time and we start hanging out together more often. Then one day (maybe just under a month in), I was taking my daughter shopping and she came with us. On this trip, I see her in a skirt for the first time. Now, let me be clear, she had some tattoos on her arms, they are lovely and great. That being said, she had only one tattoo on her leg, one very specific tattoo: a black-spade with a Q on it. Now if you don't know, the tattoo basically represents that she has a fetish for black men.\n\nNow let me clarify, I am a black-woman and she is a white woman. I have been fighting the racial fetishization of black-skin my whole life. I did not expect that my friend would be the one so blatantly engaging in it. I was angry, very very angry, but we were in public so I said nothing.\n\nI went back home, and I tried to drop it but it just kept popping back into my head. Is that what she thought of me? Is my skin just some fashion statement for her? Is she friends with me because of it? Add to this the fact that I have a son. The anger kept building up and up and up. Then one morning, I invited her over and asked my husband to take our kids to the Gurdwara for the morning (a Sikh temple - my husband is a non-turbaned Indian Sikh man).\n\nI sat her down, and we had a talk. But, the more she talked, the more I realized that she was just out of her mind. I tried to explain to her why her tattoo was problematic, she just didn't even try to understand me. Eventually, I have had it up to my head. I just kick her out of my house and tell her to never come back.\n\nThis all went down about a week ago, and I told my friends and, while most have backed me, some have said it wasn't my place to tell someone what they can and can't do with their body.\n\nWith all this in mind, AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\n1. Just for some clarification, I do not have a problem with people having a particular preference. However, there is a difference between preference and fetishization. In one, you date someone due to maybe just being raised around a particular group of people, or maybe you just want to marry within your own culture or maybe it's just that, personally, you have found people of a certain race more attractive. This is different to racial fetishization, as racial fetishization reduces people down to just their race. The stereotypes of that race are what are attractive to you, not the individual. It is dehumanizing. An even better clarification is that in one, you would never disqualify dating someone due to their race (this is a preference). In a fetishization you would actively disqualify people as dating candidates due to their race. To give an example, you can have a preference for black-women. Maybe you just find them more attractive and that's great. But if you get \"jungle-fever\" tattooed on ur body, that's fetishization.\n2. I clarified, when we talked, that the tattoo wasn't for some other reason. It was, quite specifically, because she wanted to attract black men.", "created_utc": 1676100955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zfb66/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_house_due_to/", "score": 414, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If a white girl loves black men for whatever reason, good for her. At the end of the day only sleeping with a specific race or characteristic will just limit your chances of finding a perfect spiritual and romantic partner but it is YOUR right to do so.

What, exactly, is wrong with fetishization and the expression of it? You draw a hard and fast distinction with \"preference\" but can you really be allowed to? If a woman says that she only dates six footers isn't she \"excluding\" people (most guys probably). And \"exclusion\" is your definition of fetish, remember. If a gay man wears a hanky (yes, I'm that old) denoting that he's a bottom is that not a fetish, and one that excludes? All human sexuality has elements of fetishism about it, because that's how arousal works, and let's not pretend otherwise. We are all excluding and including others on the basis of a lot of physical and behavioural factors and lets not pretend it's all about souls. In the case of your friend she may or may not be aware that to some what she's advertising is a preference for cuckold activities involving black guys (multiple) while her husband watches, and you may be uncomfortable hanging out in some places with this friend given the attention this might attract.
