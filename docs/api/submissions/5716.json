We\u2019ve been together since I was 17. We haven\u2019t even gotten engaged yet because my boyfriend says he wants it to be special so he\u2019s saving up to make it special. I\u2019m fine with this. My boyfriend\u2019s sister, on the other hand, has been dating this rich guy for 5 years. She\u2019s a year younger then me and he\u2019s the same age. He inherited some big company 2 years ago and now he\u2019s a rich CEO. He proposed to my sister in law a year ago. \nA month before the wedding, my boyfriend checked the registry to see what gift he should get and saw jewelry. I told my boyfriend that we could buy some jewelry for her, but my boyfriend insisted that it would be better to give her some of the jewelry I never wear since it would save us money. I\u2019m maid of honor, so I\u2019m paying for the bachelorette party, and my boyfriend is the best man, so he\u2019s paying for the bachelor party. So I agreed to look at my jewelry.\nWhen we went through my jewelry, my boyfriend found this set of jewelry thats separated and said it would be perfect for my sister in law. The jewelry was a set thats been in my family for years and I told him that. He said that I still never wore it and that its just jewelry. But its been passed down in my family for generations, and my mother used to wear it before she passed when I was 13.\nI refused to give it away, and my boyfriend called me selfish. He told his family about the situation, and people attacked me over facebook, tiktok, and just imessage. I did say that I was fine with gifting jewelry I don\u2019t wear, but not family heirlooms.

Maybe your bf should give away something of his?\nI have lots of rings that I got whem my grandma died.

This, personally, would be the end of the relationship for me. He's trying to manipulate and guilt you into giving up jewelry that was passed down in your family for many years to avoid having to buy HIS sister a wedding gift, and most likely to impress his sister or her husband. He clearly does not even care about the fact that the jewelry has meaning to you. Most people don't wear family heirloom jewelry regularly because it has so much significance to them, this is just utterly ridiculous.\n\nAnd more importantly, he threw a fit and dragged his family into the situation to attack you in hopes that would change your mind? Girl, LEAVE HIM, what a manipulative asshole. And I would try and ask someone who has been dragged into this situation what he told them, because I think he's lying to make you look bad. I don't think they're being told the true version of the story, which makes this so much worse.\n\nIf his sister is part of the bullying, or doesn't stand up for you when she finds out about it, she's not your friend.

Serious, major red flags from your boyfriend.  Being so insanely tight with money that he wants you to make a huge sacrifice instead of spending anything (even though he can apparently afford to pay for the bachelor party), trying to bully you into giving up precious property of your own that has special meaning, and then spreading this around and encouraging people to bully you!  This is seriously messed up.  It's actually abuse.  Please leave the relationship.\n\nOn top of this you're expected to pay for the bachelorette party?  Is this normal?  I've never heard of the maid of honour paying for this.

I\u2019m sorry to say this but you need to move your jewelry and important paperwork out now because he just showed his true self and many red flags. Also he has had 8 years to get his shit together, he is getting wife treatment without putting a decent ring on it and imo he has no plans to do right by you. He is such a cheapskate that he would rather try and FORCE you to give away your family heirlooms and to a millionaire no less. He\u2019s angling to be in their good graces and he\u2019s using YOUR family legacy to do it.
