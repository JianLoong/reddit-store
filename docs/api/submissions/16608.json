{"id": 16608, "submission_id": "13advbk", "title": "AITA for not dropping my son off at school anymore?", "selftext": " \n\n(This account is a throwaway, because people IRL know my main)\n\nMe (48M) and my wife (44F) have been separated for 3 years now. We have not formally divorced because of reasons I will not go into. We have 3 kids, 'S' (M15), 'P' (M11), and 'D' (F8). Currently, all 3 kids stay over at wife's house on weekdays, and P and D come to my place on weekends. My relationship with S is somewhat strained, and so he chooses not to come over on weekends.\n\nHowever, I have agreed to drop him off at school everyday, because he lives very far from it. It is approximately a 1 hour bus ride, but with me dropping him off, it would only take 20 minutes. It works out for me because I can drop him off at around 8:20, and get to my work on time. S is generally very quiet on our trips to school. He will put on the radio, or listen to music on the phone. Sometimes, we will go the entire trip without saying a single word.\n\nLast month, S had a student free day, and he stayed home. However, I was not aware of this, and I came anyways. I waited outside his house for around 20 minutes, until I received a text from my wife who told me S had no school. This again happened last week. I got mad at my wife and told her this was impolite, and told her she was a horrible parent for not teaching any manners to S.\n\nThis morning, I was a little late and I got to their home around 10 minutes later than usual. Again, there was no one. I later found out that S thought I was not going to pick him up anymore, and took the bus instead. I was really angry at this, because this was the third time that this happened, and I told them I would not be picking them up anymore.\n\nMy wife blew up on me on the phone, calling me an AH for not picking up my son anymore and making life generally more inconvenient. She thinks I should keep up with my son's schedule and that I should know when his student free days are (there is a school calendar stating big events at the school, but I do admit that I don't check it very often). S now has to wake up around 30 minutes earlier to catch the bus on time. However, I think that until they change, I feel like I am being used.

Stop making your wife responsible for everything and pay attention to your kids schedules. And talk to your son.", "> I told her she was a horrible parent \n\nYTA. Case closed.\n\nMeanwhile, you're so removed from your kid's life you don't pay attention to their schedule, which was planned before the beginning of the school year and your son doesn't trust you to pick him up while you insult his mother for your mild inconvenience you did to yourself.", "Wait you want her to communicate when he doesn\u2019t have school but you couldn\u2019t communicate you\u2019d be ~10 mins late thus your son being responsible and taking the bus to ensure he went to school?

This story says more about you than what you realize.", "Oh yeah YTA. Telling your wife she's a horrible parent, not memorizing your own son's schedule, getting revenge on him for that?  - class act buddy.", "YTA\n\nYou have a schedule and cant be bothered to read it?", "YTA--you said \"this is the third time this happened\"--I guess you mean that you went to their house to pick up S and he wasn't there... but each time, it was your fault.\n\nThe first two times, you arrived to pick him up on days he didn't have school. When you agreed you'd take your son to school everyday that includes the 'mental load' of checking the calendar so that you know what does he has off (and therefore doesn't need a ride).\n\nS and your ex should only need to give you a heads up when S isn't going to school because he's out sick (since that obviously wouldn't be on the school's calendar). But you have access to the same school calendar that they do -- you should already know what free days/no school days he has.\n\nThe third time, you arrived late to discover your son had already taken the bus. This confuses me, as you said it takes 1 hour for the bus but only 20 min for you... and you were 10 minutes late. But for S to get to school on time, wouldn't he have had to get on the bus at least 20 minutes before you *usually* arrive? Putting all this together, this means that your son had no idea you would be late - he got on the bus before you would normally arrive because he assumed you would not pick him up at all. Your lateness wasn't a factor. So why did he think you weren't picking him up anymore?\n\nOh, right. Because last week you got mad about not being informed about the off day (again, you should've checked the schedule yourself), then proceeded to get angry and call your ex impolite and a bad parent for not teaching S \"any manners.\" *You blowing up over the day off is why your son thought you weren't picking him up anymor*e. You failed to communicate with him, and you blamed him and his mom for your failure to read a damn calendar.\n\n***S and your ex are not the ones who need to change, OP***. YTA.", "INFP - did you text him or anything to let him know that you are running late that morning?\n\nOverall, I'm going YTA so far. Your wife is absolutely correct, there is a calendar which clearly states everything, and it's your responsibility to know what's going on in your kids life. (Regardless, how uninvolved you have suddenly decided to be because he's a moody teenager probably still dealing with the fact that his parents are separated)\n\nAlso, he's a moody teenager, of course he's going to just listen to music and ignore you the entire way. Everyone who has teenagers understands that that is the majority of the interactions that we are going to get as parents, especially on car rides.", "YTA for the reason for not giving him a ride. They\u2019re your kids too, why don\u2019t you know their schedule as well? \nTeenagers are PITA for sure, and taking an hour bus ride or waking up half hour early isn\u2019t the end of the world. But not doing it out of spite or revenge is just mean spirited.", "YTA. So the widely available schedule would tell you these details but you don\u2019t \u201ckeep up\u201d with it? And you delegate everything to your wife to the point where you think 3 years of solo parenting is enough to make it completely her fault that he has no manners? He\u2019s 15, where were you the other 12 years of his life? If this post is anything to go by, I imagine you were distant then too.", "Your wife is the main caregiver. Your son doesn't speak to you.

You also never taught any manners to S.  You are not being used, you are a parent and its your responsibility to take your kid to school, its your own fault you do not check the schedule.", "YTA.

YAY YOU!", "YOU ARE HIS PARENT \n\ndon\u2019t be surprised when he cuts you off completely \n\nYTA", "YTA. How shocking that your relationship with your son is strained\u2026", "YTA. You're blaming them for you being a bad parent. Why not text your son that you were running late? WHy not be up to date on his school schedule.\n\nNo wonder your relationship with him is 'strained'. Total AH", "YTA\nYou need to parent your kid. \n\nKeep up with his school schedule. \n\nDon't throw tantrums. \n\nBE THERE for your kid.", "You do know that just because you don\u2019t live with your children, doesn\u2019t mean that they are no longer your children?  He is your son too, if you don\u2019t like his manners, YOU missed something too.  \n\nYour son is quiet in the car, teens can be like that, they have whole lives of their own that they are trying to navigate whilst dealing with new hormones and, apparently, separated parents.\n\nYou were late and didn\u2019t contact your son, so he caught the bus.  Well done son for thinking and making sure he got to school.  It is obvious from this lack of interaction alone that your relationship with your son is horribly damaged - because neither of you bothered to contact the other and both of you assumed the worst.\n\nBullying your wife because she hasn\u2019t done something you expected without discussion, explains a lot about why you are separated.\n\nYou have access to his calendar, so whilst yes definitely, someone should have reminded you, you also could have checked and reminded them (I remind my teens of no school days, they sometimes remind me). It\u2019s checks and balances. \n\nYou are not acting like a parent or a father, you are not mentally present in their lives.  If the kids can\u2019t talk to you about little stuff when they are young (I found an orange shell, my friend had new shoes) then they won\u2019t tell you the big stuff when they are older.\n\nIf you actually care about those kids at all, get your head in the game and show them - by showing up, by being present, by showing care.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou're not being \u201cused\" you're being a parent.  This is the most time you spend with this child as they don't go to your house on the weekends with the others. Where is the communication and trying to fix the relationship with your child?? The misunderstandings are also partly on you because you should be familiar with what your child is up to including days off school and literally have access to the schedule. If you glanced at the beginning of the week or just checked when you didn't see him you'd have avoided two of the incidents. It also would've made sense for *you* to text your son if you knew you were running late and told him you were otw.\n\nAlso yelling at your wife was ridiculous and rude and you're S' parent too so you should be parenting him and are responsible if you feel he's impolite.", "YTA.  You know schools have this little thing called a calendar?  It's readily available to parents, and actually usually the entire world if they post it on their website.  It's the thing that decent, involved parents reference at a very minimum to be aware of what is going on in their children's lives if they aren't actually going to talk to their children and glean information through good old fashioned communication.\n\nI fail to see how you having to do something vaguely parental for 100 minutes per week for S and only 100 minutes per week is \"being used\".  Try spending 101 and use that additional minute to look at that calendar once a week.", "YTA since you have the schedule.", "YTA , clearly what ever is going on between you and your ex is impacting them. A parents job when separated from the other parent is to make sure the children are still ok.\n\nYou need to stop putting the responsibility on S and put it on yourself. Check the calendar weekly it doesn\u2019t take more than a few mins. \n\nIf you push him away now chances are you won\u2019t be able to repair your relationship ever.", "YTA.", "YTA S is your kid, not knowing his schedule nor bothering to learn it is your own fault as a parent, and instead of fixing that you're blaming everyone else and retaliating. Hope she bleeds you dry for child support", "YTA. S is your child. You're treating him like someone you're doing a favor for instead of, again, your literal child who you have obligations to. No wonder you have a strained relationship, you have 0 interest in actually being a dad to this kid. Seriously what is wrong with you?", "YTA for all the reasons that have been discussed so eloquently!  \n\nBut also that your son took the initiative to get to school himself and didn't even create a fuss when it was because of you.  He dealt with it and kept it moving.\n\nTo me that says he has a shed load more maturity than you and clearly shows that his mom has done a good job because he can take initiative. \n\nIt seems like you also want your child to be grateful for you doing less than the bare minimum for him.  Also because he is older, he has also seen and remembers more of latter part of your relationship with his mom than his siblings.   This, to me, speaks volumes about your character... particularly given your sense of entitlement which seeps through your post. \n\nReflect, speak to a professional and explore the reasons why your eldest might not be as close to you.  I would suggest having a conversation with him but I think you need to work on yourself first because I worry that you do not have the capacity to see things from another perspective  (at the very least with familial relationships) and you would react in a way that causes an even bigger rift.\n\nI hope you get there OP!\n\nEdited for a few sp's and grammar", "YTA. So you yelled at your wife for not teaching your son to let you know when he doesn\u2019t have school and then proceeded to set an example of how to behave by not letting him know you were running late? And you consider him having left for school something he did to you?? You were the one who didn\u2019t show and didn\u2019t text or call.\n\nWhen my kid\u2019s school calendar came out, I went through it and put all the relevant dates in my calendar. If you didn\u2019t do that or otherwise keep track that\u2019s on you. Why should either your wife or your son assume you weren\u2019t paying attention?\n\nI assume you\u2019d like to end up with a good relationship with your son. This isn\u2019t the way to make it happen. You should be playing a long game. Your son should know he can rely on you and that you want to be part of his life. Yes, it may take quite a while until you get some conversation during those morning rides, especially, if like many teenagers, your son isn\u2019t a morning person. But the message that he just got from you is that if you get mad, you\u2019ll disappear and that he can\u2019t count on you.\n\nApologize to your wife for blaming her for your failure to keep up with your son\u2019s calendar. Apologize to your son for not letting him know you were running late, likely leading to a mad scramble to make sure he got to school. Go back to being there for your son, every school morning.", "YTA. I see why your relationship is strained with S.", "YTA.  You get the school calendar and you don\u2019t read it.  She\u2019s a terrible parent, you can\u2019t even be called a parent.", "YTA.\n\nYou admit to not checking the readily available school calendar. You call your wife a horrible parent for reasons you   have not made clear. You call your son rude and seem to blame your wife, yet you are also his parent.", "This is where you need to consider how the divorce has affected your kids. It seems to me that S is finding the situation much more difficult than the others. \n\nThe lack of communication is natural given the strained circumstances. Please take time alone with him so he knows where he stands with you and offer to pick him up, if he decides he no longer wants that, respect it and tell him your door is always open. Don't let pride make you unintentionally push away your child", "YTA. School schedules are set in advance. You are the adult. You can check the schedule. You insulted your wife and her parenting while ignoring the fact you are also responsible for how the teenager was raised. Not to mention you are fully capable of checking a schedule. \n\nYou should check the school schedule. You are the only one to blame for not paying attention to school/no school days. \n\nHow would S change? What is the meaningful action you're looking for? They were not in the wrong. You've now cost them time they could use for sleep which is super important to growing teens for a mistake you made (not checking the schedule). Your wife and the child both checked the schedule. It's not their job to inform you.", "YTA. You cant call that kid your son, when you yourself are not worthy of calling yourself a father.", "YTA - so you are dropping your son and if he doesn't speak, you don't speak either? You don't even say \"see you tomorrow\", to which he would tell you that he is not going to school tomorrow.", "You sound like an AH.", "Do you even know your kids teacher?\n\nSounds like you think you are dad of the year by dropping your oldest off at school everyday while your wife deals with caring for them 5 days a week. Learn their schedule.  Its not hard to and you are the adult a still a father, not an uber driver.", "YTA\n\nDon't expect to get any form of future contact from S from now on.\n\nAlso you're one of the horrible parents that raised a son with no manners.\n\nAlso it's not that hard to not down the school calendar at the beginning of the year in your digital calendar. \n\nLastly, your other two children will know how you treated S and probably draw conclusions from that. Conclusions like \"dad does not think we are important.\"", "Somewhat the AH, I have two kids 19F and 17M,  in this case I would say take him to school always, maybe someday he will realize that he's being an AH to you but you are still there for him and you can have a relationship with your adult son.", "YTA - nta for not taking him to school anymore. Communication is key and it's understandable to not want to continue when communication is poor.\nBut YTA for telling your ex/wife she is a horrible parent for not teaching him manners. As his father, that was your job as well. You both potentially failed in instilling a respect for other people's time and proper communication. However, he's also his own person and makes his own choices.", "S's bad manners aren't anyone's fault but S. But, NTA for being over the rudeness and lack of consideration. Three bites at the apple would have annoyed most parents. And I think letting the teenager take the bus for a a few days should help him remember its his job to keep you in the loop concerning his schedule. \n\n*YTA for not keeping up with his school calendar posted online.* (And he should at the least be considerate and speak to you out loud when you drive him to school.)\n\nYou're not being used - you're doing your part and co-parenting. Detail management and scheduling are just what parents do with their dependent children - unless they outsource that.", "ESH.\n\nYTA for telling your ex she is a horrible parent for apparently not raising your kid right. That's 50% on you, my dude! You are also a parent! (Also, yes, you should be keeping up with your son's schedule.)\n\nEx is also an AH for not communicating with you better, and also for seemingly not encouraging your son to communicate better either.\n\nI think your 15 year old son is old enough to know better than his behavior implies, so could also be an AH; but, he is also a kid trapped between two parents who are clearly butting heads. So I'll give him a (sort of) pass.\n\nThe one thing that gives me the ick is: \"I feel like I am being used\". HOW?!\n\nYou made a commitment to show up to give your son a ride to school, and apparently can't even show up on time to do it...? He also probably feels like a massive burden when you do show up, given how you describe it.\n\n**OP. This isn't a you problem, or a her problem, or a son problem. This is a \"this whole family needs to figure their crap out\" problem.**\n\nNo one is texting anyone. No one is politely reminding each other of their plans or time requirements. Everyone is sulkily pointing the finger at someone else. Fix this now, OP. This is starting with your 15 year old, who is already nearly old enough to decide they don't want anything to do with you. But you are deluded if you think this will end with him. Your other kids are witnessing this. Do you want them to grow up in the same dysfunctional, argumentative atmosphere you and your ex have created?\n\n# Fix this!", "So your oldest just wants you to be his free Uber and he has no other contact with you. You need some serious discussion with him about life and how much you value him.

I think the last time was probably a miscommunication though.  When he thought you wouldn\u2019t be picking him up and he took the bus, that sounds like your ex probably told him that.  \n\nSo if you want to you could give him another chance.   Set out clear expectations- like that he will text you the day before if he won\u2019t need a ride the next day.", "ESH because you definitely should be checking the calendar but they also could have let you know the moment they realized you were outside and not just let you wait out there.", "ESH. You're responsible for knowing your kid's schedule and  even though it sounds like you do very little parenting compared to your wife; you couldn't even manage that AND you had the audacity to tell her that she's a bad parent. Are you incapable of teaching your son manners? Your son sounds like he's being bratty and he's at fault too for not being communicative with you in regards to rides. He's also acting a bit entitled - happy to get rides from you but not speak or visit with you on weekends. He's old enough to realize how shitty that is. Still, you helped raise him, and you have a bad relationship with him.

Many words for you that aren\u2019t aloud here. First of all your relationship with S is so bad he refuses to see or speak to you. You refuse to work on the relationship in any way or take responsibility for any part that you certainly played in his disinterest in you. Secondly you call your wife a bad parent for not teaching him manners like you\u2019re not this kids parent too whose job it is to raise him. You also have access to his school calendar and refuse to even look at it. But it\u2019s your wife whose the bad parent. It\u2019s clear to see why you\u2019re in the middle of a divorce with a kid who can\u2019t stand you. Id say you have very little time to take responsibility for your actions and mend your relationship with your son before he\u2019s so far checked out it\u2019s not fixable. Get off your high horse and be a good parent. From your post here you don\u2019t sound like a very good one. It\u2019s your wife and sons job to do your job for you and if they fail it\u2019s a failure on them but nothing seems to be your failure. Life must be hard when you\u2019re that narcissistic", "YTA. People are ripping into you, and it\u2019s deserved. I\u2019m going to try to be nice and just point out that the car rides in the morning are your opportunity to connect with your child. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s silent, it\u2019s you spending time together. Don\u2019t lose it.", "YTA. \n\nThere is a calendar which has the information and you admit to not checking very often. Stop blaming children for your own failings as a parent.", "slight YTA you shouldnt be blaming your ex you should be blaming your son. he is the one that wants a ride so he doesn't have to get up as early he should be the one telling you when he doesn't have school. yes you could look at the schedule but hes 15 yrs old how hard is it for him to tell you hey dad dont pick me up tomorrow there's no school. you're taking him to school even tho he doesn't want a relationship with you. its on him to communicate. apologize to your ex and get on your son about his manners", "NTA. The child has no respect for you or your time, he's fifteen and that is old enough to learn a lesson on respect. There's a bus available for him and until he respects your time, it's not your problem. He doesn't visit with you, so honor the distance he wants but verbally tell him why. \" I respect that you don't want to come over and visit with me and I need you to understand that I'm going to be respectful of your boundaries.\"", "Lol you\u2019re wife is a horrible parent for not teaching YOUR son manners???  That\u2019s rich.  Do you not see the hypocrisy in this?  I could have understood being annoyed by not getting a text on days there isn\u2019t any school as your son is at the age where he should be responsible for his own schedule but your complete lack of any other decent parenting nullifies any sympathy there.  You have access to the exact same calendar they do.  How hard is a simple \u201cjust confirming no school tomorrow\u201d text?  YTA", "What? No comment OP? Why not?", "YTA because you have access to his school calendar but don't look at it.", "YTA. Wife hasn't done anything wrong here, nor has S. You are the one who cares so little for his kid that you can't bother to take 2 mins to check on the schedule you are provided. You don't even have to make the thing!", "YTA", "YTA. Grow up and be a father.", "YTA\n\n\nYou fully admitted there\u2019s a way to track it and you just can\u2019t be bothered to. You are such an AH of a spouse and father.", "You, **a person who\u2019s so screwed it with one kid that they don\u2019t even want time with you,** called her the AH and a *\u2019bad parent\u2019,* ya know the primary parent for all **3** kids 75% of the time???\n\nAnd you communicate so little with your kid, and are so disengaged when it comes to parenting him that **YOU** don\u2019t know he did not have school, yet you\u2019re yelling at her?? **Would/could that info not be obtained by you the other parent??**\n\nYTA - in this one post you\u2019ve explained that you barely parent, then given shining examples of why that is the case. You\u2019re demanding 100% love and respect of yourself and your time, yet giving **15%.** And I\u2019m not talking money! I mean the love, care, and time it takes to be an active and involved parent.\n\nTaking your kid to school isn\u2019t a favor, it\u2019s a *responsibility!* And it\u2019s pretty much the only responsibility you have with this kid. You\u2019re the problem here. Not them. Get a school calendar (can literally be found online) put it in your phone calendar and actually coparent.", "YTA. You don't follow your eldest son's schedule, meaning that you're actively distancing yourself from your child, then turning around and blaming his mother. Dude, you're the one who isn't attentive, who isn't communicating, and who's chosen to not mend his relationship with his child. If you showed your son a modicum of effort, maybe he'd understand that his father actually loves him.", "You are a PARENT, yes you are being used. Lol so dumb and you do the bare minimum. \n\nYTA.", "YTA you\u2019re doing the bare minimum for your son and you can\u2019t even do that. Is it really that hard to look up the school calendar and put it in your phone?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake a NEW rule: YU bring any kids stying at YOUR house, SHE brings any kids staxing at HER house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: S does not haved to take the bus because YOU refuse to take him - He has to take the bus because SHE refuses to drive him.", "IKR", "I have this with my EX.  Her school lunch days and field trip days and days off are all posted on her school account and he never looks.  He expects me to text him her schedule.", "Most school districts have their calendars set and available online a couple of years ahead of time. \n\nOP very much YTA.", "I don\u2019t even think son is being TA though. This wasn\u2019t an unplanned sick day. Son may have made the (IMO reasonable) assumption that his dad already knew he didn\u2019t have school, because generally parents put their children\u2019s school vacation days into their calendar.\n\nThe only other possible AH move is being quiet in the car, which I also don\u2019t necessarily think is a true AH move. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s insulting his dad in the car every day or something. Maybe mild AH move for not thanking him for the ride if that\u2019s the case, but a lot of what OP describes sounds like normal teenager behavior even if they didn\u2019t have the divorce/shared custody situation.", "And days without classes are often posted on the large sign outside the building for a week in advance", "I'm guessing that the 15 year old kid wasn't up and dressed bright and early on the days he didn't have school.  It probably wasn't because he consulted the calendar every night before bed, but because he was told.  As I suspect he told his mom, so she didn't wake him up to get to school on time.\n\nHe's got a ride that saves him 40 minutes every day.  It wouldn't be that hard to extend that notification to his dad.\n\nOP might be an AH for other reasons, but expecting a 15 year old to let him know what's going on is not ridiculous.", "One is 15 and the other is the father with 0 custody.\n\nIf I'm the father, I'm cherishing that 20 minutes. Not whining when someone forgets to tell me things I already should know as a parent."]}
