Then you should tell them, \"I think this is going to cause resentment, so I would like us to get our own supplies, like spices, going forward. This is to make sure we don't resent one another for it.\"\n\nThen move your spices to your room or whatever area belongs to you.", "I feel bad but I\u2019m tired of being disgusted everytime I\u2019m in the kitchen", "lol NTA This is exactly what I would do, peoples actions have consequences, I don't know how mentally you can handle this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank god I don't have roommates", "NTA.\n\nbut it would be better if you moved out and found other roommates. cos you and your current ones will soon turn into acquaintances or even worse, just strangers.", "If all of the pots, pans, and dishes that they are using and not cleaning up are yours (you bought them, like the seasonings and olive oil) then NTA. If everyone contributed to purchasing those supplies.... eh still leaning NTA but it IS going a little nuclear, and there's still the possibility that they'll ask to use something and then still leave it dirty. Or break into your room if they want to cook and you aren't there, or wake you up. Etc. It may not be fun for you either in a whole new variety of ways.\n\n I 100% understand taking huge issue with not being able to use your own kitchen / dishes / pots because they're still dirty from someone else using them and then having to clean them myself in order to make food. Not cleaning up after yourself in a shared kitchen with shared supplies is a total dick move. If they are yours, sure, keep them in your room, and if they are all mutually purchased, perhaps get one or two of your most used things and a few dishes to keep in your room.", "NTA, but this is kind of passive aggressive.  You have every right to be pissed, but you're also learning the hard way why it's important to set house rules.  \n\nIf someone comes in drunk at 3 AM, it's probably unrealistic to expect them to clean their dishes right away.  But it's fine to expect it when they get up the next morning.  \n\nHave a house meeting and don't make it all about you.  Everyone should feel free to talk about what bothers them, and then seek solutions.  Most of us mess this up the first time we have roomies, but it's so important!  \n\nIn my first group apartment, someone kept washing her  panties in the kitchen sink.

If you\u2019re willing to take that on - by all means do so.", "When I shared we had common essentials bought by a pool of money between us and we took it in turns to buy it. Everything on top we bought was ours and I kept it in my room. If they had something I liked the look of I'd ask where they got it and went and got it myself. In terms of the plates etc again we had our own we dealt with ourselves. It stopped issues. But you're NTA as they can't respect your shared things.", "NTA if you've had discussions with them and have told them what the consequences would be if they can't act like adults and be responsible, respectful roommates. \n\nQuestion: how will them having to ask for the spices and oil help you? Will this make them clean up? Put them back? Will it be a total pain in the ass to have them bugging you whenever they want something?

So remove your things.", "NTA. You're in a pretty common situation -irresponsible roommates who take advantage of the one person in the house who acts like a responsible adult. If making them buy their own cooking supplies ruins your relationship with them, they were never your friends in the first place.", "Don\u2019t feel bad, it\u2019s best for everyone. I\u2019ve dealt with this several times before. Just lock up or put your stuff in your room and honestly, I would just say that you\u2019re not sharing anymore because otherwise the drama will continue. But the best way to approach it is to not pinpoint anyone regarding your spices. Just say that they were being left out and you\u2019ve decided you prefer not to contribute to communal spices. The dishes are another issue but I would avoid saying that spices are being removed as punishment for dishes because that verges on passive aggressive behavior. Just give consistent, firm but nice reminders about the dishes and if that doesn\u2019t resolve it, talk to your housemates about calling a house meeting.", "It sounds like OP is just putting her own food (seasonings) in her room, not the kitchen supplies. They would have no reason to break into her room.", "They\u2019ll probably do this nonsense again and I\u2019ll call a house meeting. I\u2019m tired of calling Robin out and she gets outraged at my outrage or acts like she doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about", "Sure, I\u2019ve tried talking to them about being respectful to us but looks like I\u2019ll have to call a house meeting and get my other 2 roommates to speak up", "Sure, but like I said in my reply, \"don't make it all about you\".  If you go in there, guns blazing, and use the meeting to tell them what they're doing wrong, this won't end well.  You're calling a house meeting because this is mandatory when people live together.\n\nI also don't think you need to wait until she does this again.  IOW, the house meeting isn't just about her and what she does.  It's about creating a sane environment for all 3 of you."]}
