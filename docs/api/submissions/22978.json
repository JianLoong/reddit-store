I am a 36 year old woman with two toddlers and a 17 year old stepson. I think some teens hear the word \u201cparentification,\u201d and think that because they were asked to help with their siblings every now and then, it applies to them. If everything OP says is true, she is N T A. But I just don\u2019t know if I believe it. I\u2019m not saying she is lying, but just because it seems real to her, doesn\u2019t necessarily make it true. \n\nINFO: I think we need to know exactly how involved she was with the kids in order to make a judgement. Did she watch them by herself several hours per day every day? Do their bedtime routines? Bathe them? Feed them? Take them places by herself? Or was she just asked to help change diapers or occupy the kids sometimes so mom could get housework done? \n\n(Also for the record, my stepson has never accused us of \u201cparentification,\u201d so I\u2019m not being defensive. I rarely ask him to watch his siblings. Maybe once a month if I can\u2019t find a sitter and really need it. The last time was when I had to take one to the dentist and my sitter fell through, so I asked him to watch the other for one hour. We live really close to the dentist.)", "How disrespectful. You are heaping further abuse on this girl. I am wondering why you chose super mommy as your name!"]}
