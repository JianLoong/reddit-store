I\u2019d say YTA for how you confronted her, but NTA for your reasoning.

If a kid needs 2h/week to learn, you can\u2019t just cut down to 1h/week. I know it is very sad, but the one who could use better your tutoring is your niece.

As a teacher, I know very well that if a kid has a C or D average it could be due to a variety of factors.  It could be that your step nephew actually has a learning disability that has not been diagnosed after all these years.  It could be that your step nephew just needs extra time, or a small group environment, to best learn, something which public schools don\u2019t really have the time for due to the very long list of standards that need to be taught by the end of the year.  Many kids are also still behind academically due to losing time during the pandemic.  You have pigeon-holed your step nephew into the category that he is a lazy teenage boy that doesn\u2019t care about school.  You really need to believe me when I say that the grade on the report card and the score on the standardized test don\u2019t always tell the whole story.  If you really are so convinced that he is a lazy teenage boy, then at least give him a chance to show you that.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to give your time to tutor family members, but your attitude towards your nephew makes you an AH.", "I\u2019m going to have to go with ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s not an AH move to decide how you spend your time, nor for choosing who you spend it with.\n\nYour sister also has no right to try and coerce you into spending your time with one child, instead of the other. Her attempts may have been coming from a place of knowing her son needs help, or it might just be an overzealous desire for equality - but either way it\u2019s not ok to push you about it.  \n\nIn this regard she created a conflict.\n\nBut writing off your nephew and, in essence, calling him stupid, is incredibly unkind to both him and his mother, and a poor reflection of your own character. \n\nThat is an AH move, even if your nephew was the laziest teenager in existence with zero academic interest, there is no reason as an adult for you to be cruel.  \n\nHis mother won\u2019t forget that cruelty, and you may have permanently damaged your relationship because, rather than find a way to establish your choice and set a boundary, you chose meanness. \n\nBoth of you need to grow up and learn to talk to each other like adults.\n\nEdit: typo", "ESH,\nYou should not have said that, but you also have the right to refuse to teach him.", "YTA - and it is good this child is not confronted with is AH aunt.\n\nIt is OK to refuse. But don't call a child waste of time. Don't devalue a child, becaus he is not as smart as others.", "NTA.  You don\u2019t have to help either of them.   Your SIL doesn\u2019t get to demand your time or determine which of her children you help.   \n\nTo address the idea you are wrong for staying why you aren\u2019t going to help the boy, I think that you have no obligation to even answer.  Realistically, SIL likely would it tolerate your unwillingness to answer.  So telling the truth was the only option.  Could you have worded it kindly? I really don\u2019t know, simply because some people will NIT listen and will bully you until you give in or you piss them off.  So you are either the bad guy because you couldn\u2019t fix the boys issues, because you wouldn\u2019t explain why you were not going to tutor both or because you were brutally honest.    Maybe you would have gotten away with a kinder version such as \u201c his needs are greater than my ability to teach.  It\u2019s the responsibility of the teachers, parents and school to manage that.\u201d  But I seriously doubt it you\u2019d have changed anything.   \n\nYou decide if you need to learn skills regarding handling delicate situations.
