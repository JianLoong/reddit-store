NTA", "NTA. Your home, your rules. Make it clear to your cousin that your cat will not be caged in the future either, and that's that. If your cousin chooses to visit your home, it will be on your terms, not hers, and in her own home she gets to make the rules. Same with your mother, your mother's decisions apply in your mother's own home, and nowhere else.\n\nYour relatives need to learn boundaries.", "NTA. The cat lives there. She doesn't", "NTA\n\nWhy does she think a cage will help. The cat would still be just as loud about it. Cats are social, and wants to be where its all happening. The room was more than enough of a \u00abcage\u00bb.\n\nAnd just to add; the cat lives there. I also will take my cat into another room when I have someone over who is allergic. But in reality the cat lives there, and should not have to move for others.", "NTA she invited herself and expected you to put your cat through undue stress. its not the end of the worlds if she cant visit you at your apartment.", "NTA. Your cat was put in another room so there was no reason for him to be caged. It seems like your cousin wanted your cat to suffer because there is no other explanation.", "NTA. Aside from the valid points everyone else has made (this is your cat\u2019s HOME, wtf), your family members are idiots if they think \u201ccaging\u201d your cat would somehow be a positive experience for the humans involved. No one, and I mean no one, wants to be in a home with a cat trapped in a carrier. You all would have been miserable.", "NTA. Your mum just wants to kept the peace and avoid conflict. However, as you pointed out, the cat wasn't even in the same room so what's the difference? It's not like the cat will jump through the wall, decapitate your cousin and drink her blood. Poor fur baby", "This is her problem, not yours. Is she afraid your cat is going to break the door down? Does your cat happen to be 200lb and answer to Cujo? Nope.  I\u2019m petty af though, so next time I was there I would say \u201cdo you have a gate, or even just crib you put the baby in? We are trying to have a nice time here and you child is making that difficult\u201d.", "NTA\n\nIt's the cat's apartment, not the cousin's.\n\nYou locked the cat away enough to protect the baby. A cage/carrier would have been overkill ***AND*** would have broken the trust between you and the cat.", "NTA\n\nShe invited herself over and you graciously put the cat in another room. That\u2019s sufficient. It\u2019s your cat and your home.", "NTA.\n\nYour cat IS family and I think its rude for people to expect pets to be caged during visits. Some pets are good with cages, some aren't. My can won't even go into a cage he hates them so much. He goes in the bedroom when people visit, just like yours. Seperating the pet from the guests is all that is required. It's quite rude of your guests to expect further levels of confinement on your pet. It's unnecessary.\n\n\"Listen cousin, I love having you for a visit, but when you are at my house there is going to be a cat in the next room behind a closed door. If you are not comfortable with that then I understand. It is your choice not to visit at my home under the circumstances.\"\n\nEDIT: OR, if you want her to feel more welcome at your house, you can just TELL your cousin the white lie.  Yes sure cousin, that cat in the next room is also in cage. What is she going to do? Barge into your bedroom to prove it with her own eyes?\n\nWhile the cat is locked away in the room he is Schrodinger's Kitty, no one can tell if he is in a cage or not. Sounds the same from the other side of the closed door.", "NTA. And outside boarding and travel, who puts a cat in a cage? Depending on how long that was going to be, that would deny your cat access to food, water, and litter, and as others have said wouldn't have changed the cat yelling that she wanted to join you. The bedroom was more than sufficient.", "You should have offered to cage her baby. Hell no! Who cages a cat?! You and your cat\u2026who is YOUR CHILD\u2026live there. Good thing she left. She\u2019s toxic, and toxic family members feed each other. I\u2019ve been there a million times. You stand your ground! Your house, your life, your boundaries! If your cousin doesn\u2019t want your cat involved, she can not be an a$$hole and invite you over to her place instead. When the baby cries, tell her you\u2019re uncomfortable and you will leave if it\u2019s not caged. Oh, no. Just no.", "NTA and your cousin makes no sense", "NTA- IMO you shouldn't have even put your cat in the bathroom. The cat lives there not your cousin or her baby, you shouldn't have to cage your fur baby just because people are at your place. Unless your cat is a danger to the baby you shouldn't have to isolate your cat for others.", "Arguably you did cage your cat. It's just that the cage happened to be room sized", "NTA. It wouldn't work with my cat tho, she knows how to open doors (the sliding type and the handle type)", "NTA. Also who tf cages a cat? All you're going to do is stress your cat out. If people can't respect that your cat lives there too, maybe they shouldn't come over at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Whoever visits me (family, friends, the pope himself) has to respect that I have a dog. The dog lives here, they don't, end of the story.\n\nI have a babygate on the door of my living room, so that I can separate my dog without closing a door. I am more than willing to close him out if my guest doesn't want him on their lap asking for belly rubs but I insist on one thing. Whoever enters the front door, has to pet him and let him sniff.\n\nExplanation: I would be also upset if someone was coming into my house without introducing themselves and I was locked out of the room where the stranger is. Quite understandable I think...\n\nThe issue is that my elder sister is really afraid of dogs. It's like a phobia. I've been living here for more than 3 years now with my dog and my sister has never visited me as she refuses to pet my dog and let him to sniff her.\n\nI am not mad at her for not willing to do this.

Then again, I don't know that much about dogs.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your cousin is ridiculous. If she's afraid of your cat, then she doesn't need to come over.
