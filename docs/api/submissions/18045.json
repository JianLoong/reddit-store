If your cousin chooses to visit your home, it will be on your terms, not hers, and in her own home she gets to make the rules. Same with your mother, your mother's decisions apply in your mother's own home, and nowhere else.\n\nYour relatives need to learn boundaries.", "NTA. The cat lives there. She doesn't", "NTA\n\nWhy does she think a cage will help. The cat would still be just as loud about it. Cats are social, and wants to be where its all happening. The room was more than enough of a \u00abcage\u00bb.\n\nAnd just to add; the cat lives there. I also will take my cat into another room when I have someone over who is allergic. But in reality the cat lives there, and should not have to move for others.", "NTA she invited herself and expected you to put your cat through undue stress. its not the end of the worlds if she cant visit you at your apartment.", "NTA. Your cat was put in another room so there was no reason for him to be caged. It seems like your cousin wanted your cat to suffer because there is no other explanation.", "NTA. Aside from the valid points everyone else has made (this is your cat\u2019s HOME, wtf), your family members are idiots if they think \u201ccaging\u201d your cat would somehow be a positive experience for the humans involved. No one, and I mean no one, wants to be in a home with a cat trapped in a carrier. You all would have been miserable.", "NTA. Your mum just wants to kept the peace and avoid conflict.

We are trying to have a nice time here and you child is making that difficult\u201d.", "NTA\n\nIt's the cat's apartment, not the cousin's.\n\nYou locked the cat away enough to protect the baby. A cage/carrier would have been overkill ***AND*** would have broken the trust between you and the cat.", "NTA\n\nShe invited herself over and you graciously put the cat in another room. That\u2019s sufficient. It\u2019s your cat and your home.", "NTA.\n\nYour cat IS family and I think its rude for people to expect pets to be caged during visits. Some pets are good with cages, some aren't. My can won't even go into a cage he hates them so much. He goes in the bedroom when people visit, just like yours. Seperating the pet from the guests is all that is required. It's quite rude of your guests to expect further levels of confinement on your pet. It's unnecessary.\n\n\"Listen cousin, I love having you for a visit, but when you are at my house there is going to be a cat in the next room behind a closed door. If you are not comfortable with that then I understand. It is your choice not to visit at my home under the circumstances.\"\n\nEDIT: OR, if you want her to feel more welcome at your house, you can just TELL your cousin the white lie.  Yes sure cousin, that cat in the next room is also in cage. What is she going to do? Barge into your bedroom to prove it with her own eyes?\n\nWhile the cat is locked away in the room he is Schrodinger's Kitty, no one can tell if he is in a cage or not. Sounds the same from the other side of the closed door.", "NTA. And outside boarding and travel, who puts a cat in a cage?

Just no.", "NTA and your cousin makes no sense", "NTA- IMO you shouldn't have even put your cat in the bathroom.
