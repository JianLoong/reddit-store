This is sexual harassment, which your employer is liable for. There is no requirement for recordings, video, or other hard evidence. Take some notes on who you talked to in the organization (dates, who was present, what was said by both parties). Do this for each time you spoke to them. IANAL, but I've done plenty of corporate trainings on this topic. Seems pretty open and shut. Your employer needs to correct his issues (or, better, terminate him) and if they don't, you have grounds to sue. \n\nSecond, this man is making unsafe advances on you, a minor. That seems pretty illegal to me, but again, not a lawyer. At the very least, try not to be alone with him and don't give him any personal identifiable information (phones numbers, addresses, socials).\n\nFinally - NTA", "NTA.  Next time, say it loudly\n\"Are you seriously STILL making sexual comments to a 15 year old?! For the last time, stop it!\"\nLOUD. So everyone can hear , customers, employees,  bosses.", "NTA.

This is sexual harassment, and the fact nothing is being done after you have reported it is putting your employer in a position for a lawsuit. Would there be any other coworkers who have had the same experience with this person? Also, you are a minor; please let your family know what is going on.", "Girl, you need a lawyer. Sexual harrassment and your employer's lack of response to it is a crime. You right to a harassment-free workplace is federally protected.", "NTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re being sexually harassed at work I feel like the gloves kinda come off, especially when nobody is willing to help you or believe you when he is reported. He\u2019s lucky I\u2019m not your coworker or he\u2019d probably be caught sleeping at work. Stay safe, Samantha. Keep reporting it if it keeps happening, and if it feels unsafe or too much get out of there. No job is worth harassment. It is NOT something you should make room for in your life.", "NTA. It makes me sad that your family isn't backing you up. You were literally being harassed by a man three times your age AND you're a minor. How are they not utterly disgusted and furious? Glad you stood up for yourself.", "If this happened to my daughter her dad and brothers would have put the fear of God into this guy.

You're not obliged to be gracious with his insecurities if he acts like a predator towards you!!\nA shame HR won't/ can't do anything, maybe it's worth trying to find a new workplace?", "Oh hell no. NTA\n\nI find a lot of things wrong here. Management needs to investigate sexual harassment because that\u2019s what that guy is doing. They can and should do something; there is something to do. If they refuse to investigate, file a complaint with your local labor department or go to HR or something. \n\nThe other thing that bothers me is that this guy is saying those highly inappropriate comments towards minors.

He's a creep.", "when i was 18-19 i worked at walmart, i worked with a 16 year old and a 22 year old. an old man (around 80 ) we worked with would routinely sexually harass the 22 year old and i, my mistake was letting it go on for as long as it did. i was used to it as i had dealt with odd comments at a previous job. the first time he said shit to the 16 year old i had enough and brought her to management with everything. he got fired. you spoke up sooner than i did, you defended yourself at a younger age than i did. and for that you should be proud. don\u2019t let yourself be a doormat, don\u2019t let these nasty men walk all over you and make disgusting comments. you\u2019re not a jerk for going after his insecurities, he\u2019s a jerk for making sexual comments to someone who\u2019s clearly not into it, especially to a child.

He can make you feel uncomfortable at will. But if you make him uncomfortable in response, you should quit. Um, no.\n\nWhat he is doing is sexual harassment, and you need to document it with HR.

If if your manager won't do anything, talk to HR, the district manager, or the regional manager if it needs to be escalated up. A 42m shouldn't be trying to hook up with 15f.

Interesting.   next time this happens, and it is sad to say that it will, go to your immediate supervisor and tell them you are filing a report with HR about workplace sexual harassment.
