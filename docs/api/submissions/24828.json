Could you ever trust her with a bf again? I know you're living far away, so it's easy to be \"ha! Try to steal my boyfriend from all the way over there!\". But you shouldn't even have to worry about this. You deserve better friends. I mean it's up to you if you want her in your life at all and how much. But it does happen that friends grow apart or grow out of each other, (or they fuck up and destroy your trust in them and hurt your heart), and you can mourn the good times while acknowledging your time has past (or you've dumped them and their deranged interpretation \"friendship\")((I recognize that I'm sure you had some wonderful times, lots of laughs, etc... but friends don't do what she did)", "I would hold onto that and if she reaches out again just let her know that you are not currently dating her next bf yet.", "OH MY GOD haha i just looked up the definition on UrbanDictionary (forgive me im not on reddit alot) and WOW that is so accurate beyond belief LOL.", "Sometimes we're in the habit of thinking someone's a friend and don't see them for who they are.
