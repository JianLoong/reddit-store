Some parents are just unreasonable about the child-free. That said, expecting people to come for four days with no kids is probably asking too much of most parents, whether they're cool or not. In fact, asking fifty people to give you four days is asking a lot of anyone. You're NTA for wanting a no-kids wedding, but I think you're probably asking too much overall.", "If you choose an \"adults-only\" resort, then they really have no choice.

I don't think kids need to be in adult spaces either.\n\nHowever, if a lot of your close friends have kids, they *will* interpret this as not being invited, regardless of how much notice you give them. It's very difficult for families that want vacations to justify and budget taking one without the kids.

Make it clear on any save the dates.  If you told me to take at least 4 vacation days and leave my kids behind, I would not go.  It is one thing to have a sitter for the actual wedding, another to leave them home for 4 days.", "NTA - but don't be offended or surprised when some people can't make it. I had a child-free destination wedding (not international, but far from most of our friends) and a lot of our friends with children only sent one spouse so the other stayed home with the kids.

You don't own the hotel venue. I would presume you don't plan on paying for accommodations for all your family and friends- so you are essentially asking that they budget for your wedding instead of a family vacation. You can make both the ceremony and the reception child-free- but you cannot prevent them from bringing children for the entire hotel venue and you should expect that most people with children would decline your wedding weekend- if you make the event child-free - you don't get to complain about who chooses not to attend.", "INFO\n\nThere really isn't enough info to go on here.\n\n1. Does 'casually mentioning' mean the invitations were sent out without specifying the 18+ rule? Or that you talked about the wedding with the family and mentioned it during the talks?\n2. Does 'not allowed for the wedding weekend' mean not allowed to come to Mexico or just not allowed to come to the wedding stuff itself?\n3.

Depending on how old the kids are four days can be a long time, both in terms of childcare and in terms of how well the little ones handle that much time apart from their primary caregivers. It's not just a question of having time to make arrangements. \n\nIt's your wedding, you can do what you like, but you sound dismissive of the difficulties you're putting on your guests by expecting them to commit four days to your wedding without their families. Be prepared for them to decline.", "YTA. Stop acting like you are helping parents relax by forcing them to get child care just to celebrate your wedding day. It's a 4 day vacation parents can decide how they want their vacation to be, either with or without the kids. Your cermony can be child free, but not the trip. It's an unreasonable ask. You will have to be ok with parents declining the invite. If everyone is paying for their own travel and accommodations, then you have no say whatsover outside of your wedding/reception.", "NTA But you have to be okay with the people who don't want to/can't come. And be open with it in advance- we understand this means some people won't be able to join us.\n\nAnd it should never have been a casual statement- your save the date (or equivalent) should have included that this would be an adults only weekend. For anyone with kids under 18, this is an add'l expense that they have to consider if they need babysitters. For those with tight finances, this might be the one family vacation- if they go that means the kids don't get a trip. For those with older teens and younger teens- this means some kids can go and others can't.\n\nYou get to invite whoever you want- but parents have to figure out how this works for their family and that may mean not going.

And you are totally right, having kids there totally changes the vibe, all of the parents are distracted, etc.\n\n...buuuut, don't be surprised if at least a few people don't end up making it.  Just like any destination wedding in general, there are going to be people who can't/don't make it for one reason or another.  Now, in addition to travel to Mexico, people are going to have to make arrangements for their kids while they are gone, which is another hurdle, and unfortunately probably a few people will not make it as a result.  Not your fault, it just is what it is.", "NTA. It's your wedding. Do what you want. But that doesn't mean everyone is going to be on board with leaving their children behind while they go to a foreign country for at least 4 days. And also be prepared for the fact that this might hurt your relationship with the nieces and nephews who are older enough to understand that you didn't want to include them on your day. You can do whatever you want, but there are consequences to your decisions.", "If I look at this like you are planning a trip and the wedding is just one thing on the itinerary then I can this being a NAH situation, especially since you are okay with people not attending.\n\nIf I look at it like you\u2019re having a weekend long wedding where you expect everyone to do everything you want for multiple days while not being allowed to turn even a moment of their downtime into a family vacation, then I admit my judgment is harsher.\n\nPS: As others have mentioned many parents are far more relaxed when they bring their children because I allows people flexibility while being close enough for emergencies. Parents can divide and conquer. They also can enjoy time *with* their children.", "NTA\nIts your wedding, you decide.

However given that you want 4 days in Mexico you\u2019re going to have to accept that those with the children probably won\u2019t come, finding childcare for a day would be ok but 4 days is going to be a big struggle for most people.", "NTA, if you are really OK with some people simply not showing up.\n\nHonest question though - I assume you guys are making accommodation plans for the group. Isn't there a place with activities for children where people could drop their kids and just enjoy the wedding? Then the ceremony and party would be children free, but not the trip. May be a sort of middle ground....", "You can do what you want, but to find babysitters for your nieces and nephews etc, for 5 days while the parents are in a different country, might make that you won't have many guests. So you need to decide what is more important to you, destination or attendance...", "NTA, unless you are deriding people's decisions to skip your wedding as a result of this policy.

Is this going to be around a holiday or school break? If so, may be harder to find care.\n\nI went to a destination wedding that there were tween/teen and kid clubs. The hosts arranged activites for the kids at the same time as adult only activities. There was one dinner that was just adults and a wine tasting in the afternoon. It worked out well because it was a mix, but that\u2019s what that couple wanted.

Of course you can stop people from bringing kids to the event itself, but I don't see how you can stop people from traveling with kids or bringing them unless you plan on booking an Airbnb for 50 people or choosing an adults-only resort?

Yeah, I love you, but I\u2019m not dropping $2-3k+ for that. ~40-50% declined, so they also had a local post wedding reception.", "I had a lot of young cousins at my wedding and yet the only one older than me got shit faced and tried to fight the dj.", ">Your wedding day is about family and friends coming together to celebrate your union, and the joining of two families. And family includes children, even if you don\u2019t have anybody our own.\n\nI do not agree with any of this. I think weddings are about the people getting married. It's a public declaration of their relationship. I don't think they join two families, this isn't a business merger. They are creating, or continuing in this case, a new family. You invite people close to you so they can show support of your union and celebrate your new family with you. Children should only be invited if you want them to be part of that celebration.", "What you are describing is what the grownups call \u201c[eloping](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/read-this-before-you-elope)\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re talking about a formal wedding ceremony and reception.", "I grew up in a multigenerational household.

But certain decisions communicate certain things.  And if your decision communicates, come or don\u2019t come, we don\u2019t really care if our choices make it difficult or impossible for you to come, well\u2026.you are going to have to accept that this very well may be hurtful to people who thought they were important to you.  Or maybe it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of hurtful but they might still feel some distance that they didn\u2019t feel before.  It\u2019s ok for your priority to be an adult free wedding, but just understand that you are also saying that your priority is NOT having all of the people you love attend.  And they will get that message.", "The couple understands if people can't attend because they can't or don't want to leave their kids for four days. Some people would like a break from their kids if the kids are age-appropriate for staying with other family or friends. There is nothing wrong with the couple having a child-free long weekend event.", "Did you need to reply in a condescending fashion because I don't agree with your opinion? No, you didn't. I don't appreciate your unnecessary rudeness. \n\nYou are incorrect in your reply to what I stated. I am also talking about a formal wedding ceremony and reception. Eloping, according to the definition you sent, is mostly about escaping and having a small wedding away. While that's what OP is potentially doing, that is not what I was referencing. You stated an opinion about what you think weddings are about as if they were facts. They are not facts. \n\nThere are an endless number of posts about weddings on here where people agree over and over that people can make their own decisions about their weddings and then it turns into fights about this and that because people don't agree on what weddings should be or should represent. \n\nI wonder if you are the anti-CF wedding troll that has been making posts lately.", "I swear sometimes reddit thinks children should be hidden from view until they\u2019re legally old enough to fuck.", "A lot of resorts in Mexico are very accommodating to kids, might have a kids activity centre, and can arrange the babysitting during your ceremony and reception.

Yay you for having found love!\n- There's a bunch of other people whom you love and who loves you. That is also great. \n- Some of these wont be able to make it as it is, which is an unfortunately reality. \n- These people will likely be super bummed out because they love you, want to celebrate with you and your wedding probably is going to be awesome. And that can be totally OK. I just hope you can see it as that instead of going on the defensive because you focus on the fact that they want you to cater to them when in reality they'd just love to be able to be there.\n- a side note: when you plan something that clearly isn't feasible for some people to attend and your reaction is DONT COME THEN, it sends a pretty clear signal that them being there isn't important to you ( which again is cool, but might upset people who love you to realise)\n\nHope you have a lovely wedding :)", "My feelings aren\u2019t hurt, honey.
