This situation has festered so badly that I am not planning on going to the wedding or home for the Hollidays this year and will go to my GFs family instead. \n\nThis thing started 4 years ago. My sister got married, I was a groomsman and very involved in the process. I was never that close with my ex BIL but he was a decent enough guy. So in July of 2022 my sister and her ex husband divorced. This was due to her having an affair with her current fianc\u00e9. My parents do what they always do with my sister and excuse whatever bullshit she pulls. I live far from home so I typically only take one trip home a year. Well last Christmas I was home and she brings this guy over to my parents. They called themselves fianc\u00e9 which again was like 4 months after my sister got divorced. I wasn\u2019t having it and didn\u2019t talk to the guy and went on a walk for most of the night. Before he left the guy wanted to speak to me and asked if I\u2019d consider being a groomsman. I pretty much told him no. That I didn\u2019t know him, wasn\u2019t gonna spend the money and more than likely wouldn\u2019t be going to the wedding. \n\nMy sister found out and blew up at me and I unloaded in front of our parents. I pretty much asked my parents if they planned on paying for a second wedding in 3 years. They told me it wasn\u2019t my business. We went at it about the whole situation and I left back for NY earlier than I intended. I\u2019ve declined my sisters invite to the wedding. Her fianc\u00e9 texted me saying how the family is gonna be upset if I\u2019m not there. I didn\u2019t respond until he called and I told him basically to get lost. I didn\u2019t plan to drop a grand on some tacky wedding between cheaters. \n\nMy parents told me they were gonna do this Christmas with the new in-laws to get to know them better. I laughed my ass off at this after they told me I was invited if I wanted to come. But if I couldn\u2019t go it\u2019s okay because I would be coming home for the wedding in February. I guess nobody had told them yet but they blew a gasket. My mom especially. Saying that she had plans for family pics and our family would ask questions. I told her that if they wanted to pay for my plane ticket, hotel, alcohol and extra expenses then I\u2019d go. If not then I\u2019m not going. My dad said they would not pay for me to come. I said \u201cso you\u2019ll pay for a second wedding but not a plane ticket?\u201d He got pissed and hung up. My mom has been texting me the last week trying to convince me. I said she can answer all the questions and take her pictures with her family. We have not really spoken in months besides my moms text and I just wanna know if I was the AH here?", "created_utc": 1697595653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17afph3/aita_for_asking_my_parents_to_pay_me_to_go_to_my/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your parents demand that you do it as a favor to them, it should be at their expense.", ">Her fianc\u00e9 texted me saying how the family is gonna be upset if I\u2019m not there.\n\n\"I'm gonna skip this one. I'll catch the next one in about 4 years.\"   \nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI wonder what they\u2019ll say when she\u2019s onto her third marriage.", "I guess your parents are trying to make the best of a bad situation, but it's not your problem. NTA.", "NTA, I'm sure you love your sister, but she is an adult now, and whatever choice she make, should be on hers. I think you need to just close this door and take care of your family instead. Otherwise, maybe just send a card to her.", "NTA -Based on your sister\u2019s past history her new marriage will not last 2 years. Stay home-enjoy the peace and quiet without family drama. Your parents definitely have a favorite child-sorry OP!", "NTA. Send 2 crock pots to her and say the 2nd is for the next marraige.", "Based on the situation and your moral standing well NTA,\n\nBut family stuff is complicated and the fact you are asking shows that (arguements aside) you care to some degree at least your relationship to your sister/parents\n\nSo as they saying goes(whatever variation), you have to lay in the bed you made.\n\nBy sticking to your moral standing (which you do you), what do you stand to potentially lose by not going. Would/could you lose a relationshop forever? As long as you are fine with that then go ahead nothing wrong with that. \n\nJust because you are NTA in a public eye doesnt mean you might remain an AH in a private (family) eye which might (or might not) be more important.", "NTA - Too much time and energy for something you don't care about.", "NTA. The Christmas thing alone would piss me off enough to not want to be involved at any level throughout. The good news for you is that this marriage more than likely won\u2019t be successful either so eventually it should all work itself out.", "But if you went, think of the toasts you could make at the reception. For example:\n\n\"....And I hope you don't cheat on your new husband like you did the last one and may your affair partners dick fall off\" etc.\n\nNTA", "Nope", "NTA. Sorry, your sense of decency and integrity is such a hard pill for your family to swallow.", "You are allowed to say no. No is a complete sentence and a complete answer. My answer if I had parents like that is to say well you may condone the cheater and approve of what she does but that is not my lifestyle and really don't want to have anything to do with it.  Then I would block everyone.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut it is close to ESH. You are very dogmatically sticking to your morals above all else. Because of your dogmatism you are being an arsehole to your parents and sister / her partner. \n\nBut you are also right that this is a marriage made out of cheating and this likely won't even be her last wedding.  So spending a grand to attend it would not be worth it. Especially if you would not enjoy it because you morally disagree with it. \n\nMake it very clear why you are not going. \"I am not paying a grand to attend this wedding because I morally disagree with this relationship borne from cheating. I would only attend this wedding for your benefit and your benefit alone however this means I need you to pay for it because otherwise its too much for me. I understand that you want us to be a happy family and appear that way to others however I feel like you are glossing over a serious issue to make that happen\" \n\nRemind them that you do love them and you are not doing this because of them or because of a lack of care about them.", "Nta (light e s h)\n\nSo your sister's a cheater, cheaters are a solid default ah.\n\nYou are completely justified in not supporting the marriage, not wanting to attend the marriage, not really wanting anything to do with either of them. I guess even less ah because you're treating her, and her affair partner, completely the same, because they are both equally guilty of being ahs.\n\nOnly place you're an ah is to your parents. They can pay for as many weddings as they want to, it's their money. Your demand that they pay you to attend was uncalled for. Just tell them you morally disagree with the wedding, and if you *did* attend, then it would be to raise your hand when they ask if anyone objects.", "Nah if you want to give up your relationship with your family because your sister cheated then that's on you", "ESH. I get not going to the wedding because you disapprove, but you don\u2019t have to be condescending or hostile about it. I\u2019m sure this is an unpopular opinion, but your sister and her fianc\u00e9 could have a happy marriage. My grandparents fell in love while married to other people; it\u2019s not the best way to start a marriage but it happens.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think this is just about morals (although I do agree with you). This is about your parents enabling and paying for whatever their \u201cdarling daughter\u201d wants. They are clearly choosing her over you, imo, and that hurts.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m pissed on your behalf. I think any financial contribution paid for a wedding, education, a home, whatever should also be made to that child\u2019s other siblings. So if they drop $20k on her wedding, they owe you $20k.\n\nI recommend going No Contact until this farce of a wedding is over, then decide next steps.", "Have you ever talked to your sister about why her first marriage fell apart? Was it because she fall in love with someone else, or were there other reasons? \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re judging her based on what you see, or if you\u2019ve ever bothered talking to her about it. Maybe there are more reasons for her first marriage to fall apart. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never done this I say YTA, if you\u2019re gonna be this judgmental, at least know you \u2018can\u2019 be. Otherwise it\u2019s your sisters life and not your business what she does or not.", "You don't want to go, so why would you go if they pay for your trip?\n\nThey do want you to go, and you apparently will go if they pay for it... so why won't they pay?\n\nSeems strange, these are not the actions of balanced (real?) people.\n\nESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Which is definitely a lot of money don't get me wrong, but some people have a lot of savings and being able to pay for two weddings doesn't necessarily mean they can afford to pay for 2 weddings. If that makes sense."]}
