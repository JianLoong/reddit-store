This situation has festered so badly that I am not planning on going to the wedding or home for the Hollidays this year and will go to my GFs family instead. \n\nThis thing started 4 years ago. My sister got married, I was a groomsman and very involved in the process. I was never that close with my ex BIL but he was a decent enough guy. So in July of 2022 my sister and her ex husband divorced. This was due to her having an affair with her current fianc\u00e9. My parents do what they always do with my sister and excuse whatever bullshit she pulls. I live far from home so I typically only take one trip home a year. Well last Christmas I was home and she brings this guy over to my parents. They called themselves fianc\u00e9 which again was like 4 months after my sister got divorced. I wasn\u2019t having it and didn\u2019t talk to the guy and went on a walk for most of the night. Before he left the guy wanted to speak to me and asked if I\u2019d consider being a groomsman. I pretty much told him no. That I didn\u2019t know him, wasn\u2019t gonna spend the money and more than likely wouldn\u2019t be going to the wedding. \n\nMy sister found out and blew up at me and I unloaded in front of our parents. I pretty much asked my parents if they planned on paying for a second wedding in 3 years. They told me it wasn\u2019t my business. We went at it about the whole situation and I left back for NY earlier than I intended. I\u2019ve declined my sisters invite to the wedding. Her fianc\u00e9 texted me saying how the family is gonna be upset if I\u2019m not there. I didn\u2019t respond until he called and I told him basically to get lost. I didn\u2019t plan to drop a grand on some tacky wedding between cheaters. \n\nMy parents told me they were gonna do this Christmas with the new in-laws to get to know them better. I laughed my ass off at this after they told me I was invited if I wanted to come. But if I couldn\u2019t go it\u2019s okay because I would be coming home for the wedding in February. I guess nobody had told them yet but they blew a gasket. My mom especially. Saying that she had plans for family pics and our family would ask questions. I told her that if they wanted to pay for my plane ticket, hotel, alcohol and extra expenses then I\u2019d go. If not then I\u2019m not going. My dad said they would not pay for me to come. I said \u201cso you\u2019ll pay for a second wedding but not a plane ticket?\u201d He got pissed and hung up. My mom has been texting me the last week trying to convince me. I said she can answer all the questions and take her pictures with her family.

Because of your dogmatism you are being an arsehole to your parents and sister / her partner. \n\nBut you are also right that this is a marriage made out of cheating and this likely won't even be her last wedding.  So spending a grand to attend it would not be worth it. Especially if you would not enjoy it because you morally disagree with it. \n\nMake it very clear why you are not going. \"I am not paying a grand to attend this wedding because I morally disagree with this relationship borne from cheating. I would only attend this wedding for your benefit and your benefit alone however this means I need you to pay for it because otherwise its too much for me.

I guess even less ah because you're treating her, and her affair partner, completely the same, because they are both equally guilty of being ahs.\n\nOnly place you're an ah is to your parents. They can pay for as many weddings as they want to, it's their money. Your demand that they pay you to attend was uncalled for. Just tell them you morally disagree with the wedding, and if you *did* attend, then it would be to raise your hand when they ask if anyone objects.", "Nah if you want to give up your relationship with your family because your sister cheated then that's on you", "ESH.

I don\u2019t think this is just about morals (although I do agree with you). This is about your parents enabling and paying for whatever their \u201cdarling daughter\u201d wants.

I think any financial contribution paid for a wedding, education, a home, whatever should also be made to that child\u2019s other siblings.

Maybe there are more reasons for her first marriage to fall apart. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never done this I say YTA, if you\u2019re gonna be this judgmental, at least know you \u2018can\u2019 be.

Are you angry at this being another example of your parents over the top favouritism? Have you been cheated on, causing you to really struggle being around them?\n\nOn a moral stance, I understand. Cheating is a massive form of betrayal and can cause trauma. Yet it's known cheaters always face their own repercussions. Whether it's losing their partner how they got them, regret, trust issues from knowing how easy cheating is, living with the insecurity that leads them to cheat. Or feeling forced to make the relationship with the AP work because of the upset they caused and not wanting to hear 'I told you so'.\n\nIt sounds like your former BIL has moved on. He's probably happier without your sister. Your sister didn't cross any unforgivable lines. She didn't lie about her kids paternity or start (*groom*) an affair with a child.
