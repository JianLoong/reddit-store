This situation has festered so badly that I am not planning on going to the wedding or home for the Hollidays this year and will go to my GFs family instead. \n\nThis thing started 4 years ago. My sister got married, I was a groomsman and very involved in the process. I was never that close with my ex BIL but he was a decent enough guy. So in July of 2022 my sister and her ex husband divorced. This was due to her having an affair with her current fianc\u00e9. My parents do what they always do with my sister and excuse whatever bullshit she pulls. I live far from home so I typically only take one trip home a year. Well last Christmas I was home and she brings this guy over to my parents. They called themselves fianc\u00e9 which again was like 4 months after my sister got divorced. I wasn\u2019t having it and didn\u2019t talk to the guy and went on a walk for most of the night. Before he left the guy wanted to speak to me and asked if I\u2019d consider being a groomsman. I pretty much told him no. That I didn\u2019t know him, wasn\u2019t gonna spend the money and more than likely wouldn\u2019t be going to the wedding. \n\nMy sister found out and blew up at me and I unloaded in front of our parents. I pretty much asked my parents if they planned on paying for a second wedding in 3 years. They told me it wasn\u2019t my business. We went at it about the whole situation and I left back for NY earlier than I intended. I\u2019ve declined my sisters invite to the wedding. Her fianc\u00e9 texted me saying how the family is gonna be upset if I\u2019m not there. I didn\u2019t respond until he called and I told him basically to get lost. I didn\u2019t plan to drop a grand on some tacky wedding between cheaters. \n\nMy parents told me they were gonna do this Christmas with the new in-laws to get to know them better. I laughed my ass off at this after they told me I was invited if I wanted to come. But if I couldn\u2019t go it\u2019s okay because I would be coming home for the wedding in February. I guess nobody had told them yet but they blew a gasket. My mom especially. Saying that she had plans for family pics and our family would ask questions. I told her that if they wanted to pay for my plane ticket, hotel, alcohol and extra expenses then I\u2019d go. If not then I\u2019m not going. My dad said they would not pay for me to come. I said \u201cso you\u2019ll pay for a second wedding but not a plane ticket?\u201d He got pissed and hung up. My mom has been texting me the last week trying to convince me. I said she can answer all the questions and take her pictures with her family.

They can pay for as many weddings as they want to, it's their money. Your demand that they pay you to attend was uncalled for.

Cheating is a massive form of betrayal and can cause trauma. Yet it's known cheaters always face their own repercussions.
