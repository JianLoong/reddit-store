We're going to elope alone in Vegas this year, and because we won't have any of our friends at the wedding, we thought it might be a fun idea to have a joint bachelor/bachelorette party at a cottage we're renting up north for the weekend. \n\nThe trouble is, as we've been together for so long, some of our friends already have babies on the way and will have children of 8 and 9 months by the time we have our party in November of this year. We would prefer if babies were not at this event, as we feel this party should be about us, and don't want the babies being too much of a distraction or take away from the fun weekend we wanted to have with our friends. \n\nIs it too much to ask of our friends to not bring their babies with them, provided they have so much time to prepare and make alternate arrangements to come? Or am I the asshole and should allow for all babies to come regardless? Both sets of friends will be new parents and have no idea what to expect, and currently are saying they might not be able to come as a result. Should we be upset about this?\n\nEDIT\n\nThank you for all the comments, I really appreciate each and every one of you.

With an 8 or 9 month baby, there's basically no chance I'd be going to a bachelor / bachelorette weekend away at a cottage.\n\nEveryone is different - some people are more willing to leave their babies than others, some people have trusted family who live nearby and would take their baby, and others don't, some people breastfeed and wouldn't want to be away from their baby for a weekend.\n\nIf they don't come, it doesn't mean that they don't think you're important, or they don't care about you - it just means that weekend parties are a game for young adults without children.\n\nAnd if you do tell them to come and bring their babies, there will probably always be one baby taking a nap, and your cottage won't have any room for adults because it will be full of large brightly-colored plastic objects.\n\nNAH", "NAH\n\nOf course you can make a \u201cno babies\u201d policy for the trip!\n\n\nYou ended your post with \u201cshould we be upset about this?\u201d And I think it\u2019s important to note you W B T A Hs if you were angry at them because they couldn\u2019t make it. As you said, they don\u2019t have kids or know what to expect so it\u2019s reasonable they may not be able to commit.  Even if they don\u2019t bring the babies, this may be the first time they are away for an extended period so they don\u2019t know how they will handle it. Even if it\u2019s easy for them, they will have to check in with the caregivers and will (likely) still be exhausted so I\u2019d say manage your expectations. They are becoming parents and that will (and should) be their number one priority. The weekend may be about celebrating you and your partner but everyone in attendance has a life with other stuff going on. Don\u2019t be upset if that means they\u2019ll have to opt out or limit their involvement. \n\nI think it\u2019s realistic and smart that they are being cautious about committing.

You're talking about an overnight, even a weekend stay. \n\nSo yes, it's unreasonable to expect your friends that have children to attend if they can't bring their children along. \n\nThat said, it's not really appropriate to bring children to bachelor and bachelorette parties\u2014at least, not as portrayed by the movie industry. \n\nSo take your pick\u2014rent the cabin, realizing that your friends with children won't be there.\n\nOr just go to a club or whatever in town for a couple of hours.

Yep, it's way too much to ask and you're going to have most of those new parents RSVP that they will not be attending.", "NTA to not want the babies there. Doesn\u2019t sound like an appropriate event for kids at all. \n\nBut you would be T A if you are upset if the parents decide to not attend. They shouldn\u2019t be dramatic about it if they decide not to attend, but you have to accept that the possible consequence of having a child-free event is that some parents will not attend. It might be last minute if a babysitter cancels or they may just politely refuse. But it\u2019s 100% okay for them to not attend. Just like it\u2019s 100% okay for you to have the event child free.", "NAH Bringing children to a bachelor/bachelorette party is a new one for me. It's kind of you to be so considerate of them being new parents, but yeah, definitely no babies/kids. With that said, you're also going to have to be understanding if they can't make it. Not easy to just have someone else care for your baby, especially for days at a time.\n\nI'm assuming they're not trying to demand they be allowed to bring their kids? If they are, then my vote is definitely going to change to N T A.", "NAH\n\nYou are free to have exactly the kind of party you want.\n\nAnd people who are invited to that party are free to accept or decline, based on the time of the party, the location of the party, and the activities that will be going on at the party.\n\nBecause finding overnight care for babies is not easy, unless you have a doting relative ready to hand, or can find a reliable overnight nanny/childcare facility. And you might find that parents don\u2019t want to spend the entire weekend away their babies. \n\nBabies change monthly, even weekly. Their nap and feeding schedules change. The amount of care they need varies. These babies are not even born yet. It is impossible for the parents to tell if they will be comfortable leaving their children for a weekend at this point.\n\nIt is not a reflection on you or your party or your marriage. It is just a fact. If the parents don\u2019t come to your party, it is because the conditions set for your party don\u2019t agree with the requirements of taking care of their babies. \n\nAnd you should not be upset when people decline any invitation of yours. Yes, this party, in your eyes, is a mini-wedding reception where you can celebrate with your friends.\n\nBut to your friends, it may be a fun party, but a long way away in a cottage, requiring either an overnight stay (time and expense), or one half of each couple to be a designated driver so as to be able to drive home after an evening\u2019s fun.\n\nI think you can have the party you want, a weekend at a cottage, or you can have the guests you want, all your friends including the parents of small babies. But having the party you want with all the guests you want is probably not going to happen.\n\nYou can either nicely accept that some friends cannot spend an entire weekend at the cottage, or change the scope of the party to one night closer to home so everyone can attend.\n\nWhat you cannot do is be upset that someone declines an invitation. It is an incident, not a summons.", "NTA. Just don\u2019t be annoyed at them if they don\u2019t come. Especially if a lot of your friends are couples. Being joint doesn\u2019t give them the option of the other parent watching the kids.", "NAH. You're NTA for wanting a child-free event, likewise your friends are absolutely NTA if they choose not to come especially if both parents are invited. \nI understand why your friends asked -- babies under 1 are typically an exception to child-free events if they are breastfeeding because they are still dependent on mom at that point for food.", "NTA\n\nAsking is fine. It\u2019s a bachelor/bachelorette party after all.

Let the parents know WELL in advance when and where the event will take place.  Realize that the date is \"set in stone\" and cannot be changed.\n2. If people say they cannot come, do not harrass them about it.  \n3.

Some of them might prefer to stay at home with their baby.", "NAH You get to make the rules. Depends on your party. Ours was a backyard party and we decided kids and families were welcome. It wasn\u2019t too different from any friend gathering we would have. If you think you\u2019re going to have a rager, no kids makes sense but expect people not to come. You could also just leave it to the parents to figure out depending on the size of the house. They may go to bed early. People saying kids shouldn\u2019t be at the party are saying so basing on the assumption of what a traditional bach party is like, I think context matters. If its a campfire cookout thing, maybe kids are fine. If you guys are up playing poker all night and getting loaded probably not fine. Just decide what you want and accept that it may not be for everyone.", "NTA. Be understanding though if this means some people won\u2019t/aren\u2019t able to attend.", "NAH, of course you don\u2019t want babies there, but then being new parents it\u2019s likely to be challenging/expensive to find child care for a couple days.

For example having them stay in a hotel or a smaller condo nearby where the babies could stay with a sitter while they joined in the party.", "NTA but don\u2019t be surprised if said friends don\u2019t come. I would never leave my 8-9month old child with someone else for a weekend", "NTA. but you can't be upset if the friends with babies can't come.

But at 23, I reckon none of you could afford it.\n\nIf you're older (and probably slightly wealthier), kids make things more complicated.\n\nYour situation is made more complicated still, albeit for a genuine great reason - normally stag and hen (buck and doe, bachelor and bachelorette etc etc) doos only require half your pals at any one time, so you can stagger them a weekend apart so someone's always at home with the kids. Having them combined sounds like you and your friends all have a great thing going.\n\nAs others have said, your NTA for saying No Kids, but it comes with the risk that some folk may have to skip it.", "NTA -  What kind of bachelor/bachelorette party has babies present?? Those come 9 months after the party usually.", "NTA.  That is not a suitable environment for children.

Parenting comes first for parents, and the needs of their kid should always be more important than attending a party. So yes, if you make your party adult only, there is a chance that parents will be unable to attend because their kid comes first.  Most parents are ready to leave their kids for a weekend when they reach 8-9 months, but sometimes plans fall through and it's fair enough for parents still to be very picky about who they feel comfortable leaving their kid with at that stage.  \n\nBut I wouldn't make it an issue now.

My husband and I have been married over two decades, no kids, very happy--I think being childfree is the right choice for way more couples than make that decision.\n\nBut because they're in a different life place, they CANNOT reciprocate for all things you did for them when they were in your spot.  Susan and Mitch had a blowout weekend in Vegas before getting married and you were happy to be along for it!  There was an understood and not expressed expectation of reciprocity.  When you and Devin tie the knot, you (and they) expected another blowout weekend in Vegas the night before!  \n\nBut now Susan and Mitch have a baby on the way and will have that newborn when it should be YOUR crazy weekend in Vegas time.\n\nIt's not fair.  You went to THEIR crazy Vegas weekend.  The rules of friendship say they must reciprocate.\n\nThey can't.  That little screaming thing is 100 percent dependent on them.  They can't make ANY plans or decisions without considering it for at least a few years, and it's going to figure heavily for at least a couple of decades (and probably after).  It's not fair, but it's normal.  And it's a few years before you can effectively leave a baby overnight.  There will be no Crazy Vegas Weekends (or Crazy Mountain Cabin adult-only weekends) for Mitch and Susan for a gooooood long while.\n\nThis will get complicated if you aren't also having kids.  It's going to be increasingly difficult for you and Devin to even stay good friends with Mitch and Susan, whose lives have taken a REALLY sharp 90 degree curve that changes everything.  You \\*can\\* stay friends with them, but you're going to have to accept that they have to bend everything in their lives around the kids, and that includes your friendship.\n\nYou're going to feel some type of way about it, as the kids say, and you have every right to--but don't take it out on Mitch and Susan.", "You really, really want the friends with babies to come for the weekend?

Still expect the following things:\n\n\\-Moms who are breastfeeding or pumping will need to disappear every few hours for a chunk of time to do that. In between, they will not be drinking.\n\n\\-Parents will be \u201cdistracted\u201d by their babies, ie, being responsible parents who love their children (we hope) will want to go check on their babies every so often.\n\n \\-There may be last minute cancellations due to sick babies, especially if any of them are in daycare.\n\n\\-Parents may be delighted to have some grownup fun, but may also be tired and not up for staying up til all hours getting shit faced.\n\n\\-Some of them still won\u2019t want to come because, for any number of reasons, the whole thing still doesn\u2019t work for them.", "NTA bachelor/bachelorette parties no one wants babies there.

A baby who, based on the timeline you shared, hasn't even been born yet. Right now they're hoping for a healthy baby, and have no idea if that's what they'll get. They don't know what the pregnant parent's body will go through, if the baby will be premature, and they don't know anything about how the baby will behave --- how easily the baby will adapt to things like formula, how breastfeeding will go, if they'll sleep through the night easily, etc. Their first obligation is to this literal life they are creating who is wholly dependent on them for life and safety. \n\nYou getting drunk at their bachelorette party doesn't mean getting drunk with you is more important at that baby. Of course their baby takes priority -- why wouldn't it? Why would you be friends with someone who didn't give a shit about their baby compared to getting drunk with friends? You're not asking them to hold your hand as someone dies, you're asking them to come party with you. \n\nYou both need to do some serious reevaluating about your perspective and what you think you're owed from your friends if you want to keep them in it.

What a ridiculous, self-centered take.", "Those babies are still going to be quite new in the time frame you're telling us. Many parents would not be ready to leave an 8-9 month old baby with a sitter for an entire weekend, especially if the mothers are nursing as they'll still need to go pump milk on whatever schedule they have and could possibly no longer be able to nurse directly after coming back to the baby.

I couldn't be away from her for more than about 6 hours.  She would eat some baby food and drink water, but was still primarily breastfeeding and used to nursing at bedtime.  I would not be willing to starve my baby to attend a bachelorette party.\n\nFinding a babysitter to take a baby for the entire weekend (if you're inviting both halves of the couple) is going to be very expensive, straight up impossible, or perfectly easy if grandma lives down the road and is healthy enough to take care of a baby for a couple days.

Especially if they are breastfeeding, have any trauma you may not know about, don't have childcare they trust, the list goes on. \n\nI 100% believe saying no babies to a bachelorette is reasonable and also them asking was probably them trying to find a way to still participate *because* you matter so much to them and they don't want to miss out.", "That\u2019s what makes you the AH.

Your party, your rules.", "NTA, but you will have to be realistic about attendance.\n\nFor an event, and especially a social/party one like this, wanting it to be child free is completely reasonable. Having babies or young children around will completely change the nature of that event - and activities or trips out will need organised around the children and need people to sit out to care for them, a late night drinking will need to be done quietly so as not to disturb the sleeping baby in the next room, and everyone in a small cottage or apartment may getting disturbed by a baby weakling during the night or children getting up early.\n\nThat doesn't mean you cannot work around these problems fairly easily with a little planning and effort, but they will change the nature of the event.\n\nHowever, the fact that some of the group do/will have babies or young children also means that they do have something they see as far more important governing how they can act and what they can do. A parent of a nine month old baby cannot necessarily just drop the child off somewhere and go out for a weekend partying - a child of that age may still be breastfeeding, they may not have anyone suitable to look after them, or they may just not yet be willing to be parted for that length of time. \nThis means that it just may not be possible for those people to attend if you don't feel it appropriate to have a baby or child in attendance.\n\nSo you are definitely not an asshole for deciding on a child free event, and it would still be good etiquette to invite your friends anyway (as they may still want to come and have childcare available), but you will also need to understand that they may not be able to make it, and that is just a practical decision and nothing against yourself as a friend.\n\nYou are of course also free to consider whatever compromises may suit - if the event is not too far to travel, a parent attending party of the weekend but not staying may be an option, perhaps allowing the children during the day when you are doing some things but not at night when you plan on having a few drinks, or letting couples trade off a child, stay elsewhere nearby or anything else that works for your plans.", "NTA.

No need to piggyback on OP and future spouse\u2019s party weekend.", "I mean, this is all fair, I just don\u2019t think it matters. \n\nYeah, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of events where babies aren\u2019t welcome. That\u2019s not a bad thing, that\u2019s probably a good thing. Such is life. Oh well, some people miss out, everyone moves on. \n\nCan you imagine trying to have a party with babies there? I wouldn\u2019t even feel comfortable having a drink. What if something happens and I\u2019m not sober to help?", "Just a suggestion but you may want to find some like minded friends about kids. I'm not saying ditch your current crew, but often with time children will take precedent and if they have multiple kids, you may get bogged down with many kiddie events and family events that take precedent. I have children, but I also understand friends who don't, or are even in different places. My kids are elementary age, so they are way more time consuming than my friend's daughter in college. She and her hubby are enjoying empty nest and many trips (we can't go on). I have a friend who is single with no kids, so her life is very different than mine, specially in the day to day. I know sometimes she's out and about and she knows sometimes I'm busy with family. It's okay to have several friends/ groups to associate with and can meet different needs! Congrats on upcoming nuptials!", "NTA.\n\nWhen you become a parent you miss out on parties because of that. Especially when the kid is tiny. It's a normal part of life.\n\nInvite all of your friends. The ones that can't make it because of their newborn: offer to get together to celebrate at another time/place. Choose something different to do with them, so it will work for them and with the baby (either so they can arrange a sitter or with the baby present).", "NTA I wouldn't want my kids at a bachelor party tbh lol", "There is a very small number of parents who would actually leave their 9 months baby for an entire weekend. Unless the kid has already been raised half the time by their grandparents or something like that. \n\nI have a cousin who literally pawned her kid off to her parents for half the week from day one. In a (very rare) situation like that, it would be doable for the parents to leave for a weekend, since they already do that anyway. For everyone else, there is no chance.\n\nWhen my kids were 6 months, we were extremely ready for a weekend away, but there was zero chance we would have actually ever done that.\n\nFor OP's case, there is NA, but the friends will simply not come. They can meet another time.", "This is for an entire weekend. There is literally zero parents anywhere who would hire a babysitter for an entire weekend, unless they were to already have a live-in nanny hired full time from day one.\n\nStill no AH. The friends will just not go to the party. They can meet another time.", "Yeah, you can request their presence, but it is not a summons. You need to be cool about them not being able to come. You do not understand their circumstances.", "INFO did you have a baby when you were there for them?", "How would they make arrangements for an unborn child? They don\u2019t know if the baby will have issues, who they trust to watch the baby, if the baby\u2019s will be breastfed or not, if the baby\u2019s sleeps, if it has separation anxiety, if the mom will have post-partum depression. Also, you realize how expensive an overnight babysitter for an infant would be? That\u2019s potentially thousands of dollars."]}
