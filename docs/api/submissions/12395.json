I and another girl had to go so we went to open the door to the room with the bathroom to find his dad screaming at us that we didn\u2019t have permission to access that room which was super weird. We didn\u2019t even know he was down there. My friend then goes oh yeah I forgot to tell you my dad is resting in that room so you have to use the main bathroom upstairs no biggy.

Even if you have the keys. What if he was laying on the couch in his birthday suit? Really, it takes 10 seconds to knock on a door, open the door, and say HELLO, is anyone here?

Once I calmed down I would have apologized to you for my overreaction towards you but still been mad at however told you it was okay without warning me about it. Especially since in that scenario the person who I actually lived with would know I was home and that letting you come over unannounced like that would upset me. Even in that scenario though you would not be the ah. The person who gave you permission without warning me would be. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of possible reasons for why the dad got upset and I can think of some pretty extreme ones but in none of those scenarios are you in the wrong. You asked a person living in the house if it was okay for you to go over and got the keys from them to do so. You did your part to make sure it was ok.", "ESH  Yes, his dad did overreact a bit, but going into someone's house unannounced and uninvited (while your BF said you could, you didn't have permission of the homeowner to do so) can be very startling.  When my husband came home a day early from a trip, I almost clocked him with a baseball bat because I had no idea who was coming in, through the garage, without turning the lights on, and not saying anything.  It startled the bloody hell out of me and after the jump scare it took me a while to calm back down.  Depending on what Dad was working on, your sudden appearance in his house could've been very disrupting.  If he was doing something personal (which he's totally allowed to do in his own house), same thing.  And if he was really put out/startled/angered by your random presence, I'm not surprised he was still angry after the explanation, because why you were there wasn't the problem: you randomly showing up was.  You were intruding.\n\nYour BF should've warned his dad, and next time you see him I'd apologize again (and then drop it.  If he keeps freaking out then he'll be the AH).", "INFO: Did you knock or just walk in?", "NTA this was 100% your bf's fault, he should have checked with his dad or told you to ring the doorbell first.\n\nHe shouldn't be giving you keys to a shared house without telling other people who live in the house. Could have been a text.", "NTA Dad was probably interrupted doing something he didn\u2019t want to get caught doing.", "NTA. You had a very valid reason for stopping by and it was your boyfriend\u2019s responsibility to tell his dad you were coming. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it.", "NTA BF should\u2019ve given the heads up. Dad is being overdramatic, y\u2019all should\u2019ve had a little laugh.", "NTA your boyfriend \u201cdropped the ball\u201d by failing inform his parents", " NTA clearly your boyfriend should have told his dad that you would be stopping by. His dad also seem to overreact quite a bit, but on the other hand, I think you could\u2019ve knocked, especially if his car was visible", "His dad is a prick and he should apologize. He's a fuck.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking! What\u2019s dad up to?!", "Well he did say he thought she was breaking in.. he was probably just still in freak out mode thinking he had intruders in the house.", "If this is in the US I\u2019d be afraid to get shot for real. Considering he even said he thought you were an intruder. But yea NTA, if anything your bf should warn his housemates when someone\u2019s coming over like that", "He was probably jerking off and almost got caught.  Embarrassment can really make a guy blow his top.", "Whaaaaaat? A grown ass man watching porn and wanking? Le shock!", "Could be that, or he could have just been genuinely spooked by hearing someone in the house and was a little worked up when he found you. If he\u2019s normally a cool dude, I\u2019d just apologize again next time you see him and there\u2019s a decent chance he apologizes back for his reaction. \n\nHaving someone come in or even just try to get into your house unexpectedly is suprisingly scary. I had someone try to open my front door in the middle of the night once, whole thing lasted maybe 3 min, but I double checked the locks probably 30 times the next day out of anxiety and then like 6 months later a fedex guy opened my storm door to hide a thin package between that and my front door and I just about shit my pants lol. Brain just went right back to that moment. I still don\u2019t think it was your fault, just an unfortunate lapse in communication. But that\u2019s a possible explanation for his reaction.", "I see what you did there", "Was his vehicle there? If so you are definitely the AH you should have knocked. Either way your BF lives with his parents but doesn't own the home. He should have informed his parents you were stopping by whether they were home or not. I'd be pissed if my kid gave his key out to someone too.", "NTA\n\nBoyfriend should have warned his dad.

Sure he can be mad, but it\u2019s the BF he should be mad at not you. You got permission from one of the people that lived there.

But he reacted ungraciously at best.", "First thought: Dad wasn't meant to be home!", "He didn't overreact at all. Someone just walked into his home when he knew his other two family members were out. Turns out that someone was his son's GF and she just walked into his home like she owned the place, all because his son gave her a key.\n\nI would consider that a huge invasion of privacy on my son's part and would be pissed too.", "Why would you not knock first to ensure you weren't barging in on his family?! ESH", "NTA. Your bf is right, he should have alerted his dad, and his dad is also overreacting. You should be able to pick up your meds.", "With how I was raised, if it was a boyfriend still living with his parents, I would have had the decency to know instead of using the key. That is me though, because yes, it is your boyfriend's home too, but first and foremost, his parents own the house, and they deserved respect.", "I dunno I'd react that way from fear and annoyance in this situation. Although his annoyance is misplaced. But if someone came into my home when I wasn't expecting them I'd seriously crap myself and the adrenaline rush I'd be getting wouldn't calm me quickly enough to be controlled about my reaction. Hell for all we know the dad has serious anxiety around such things like many people would if they thought someone was breaking into their home while they are alone inside it. I don't think its unreasonable of him. \n\nHowever I'm going with ESH. OP should have knocked before letting themselves in. \nSon should have checked with his parents before giving his keys out to ANYBODY. \nDad should have tried to gather his composure and not freak out at OP so completely.\n\n Also there is a lot we do in our own homes when we think we are alone that would be considered inappropriate to do with others present so I really doubt dad was doing anything wrong exactly.\n He may have been in the middle of picking his nose and eating it, drinking milk straight from the bottle, having a wank or shitting with the door open. These are all things people are entitled to do in their own homes while alone (if somewhat gross with the bogie eating). I don't get why everyone is automatically jumping to such conclusions about the Dad here?!", "He\u2019s working and someone is suddenly in his house. I\u2019d be freaked out too.", "IDK, I\u2019d be pissed if someone who I didn\u2019t give access to suddenly came into my house."]}
