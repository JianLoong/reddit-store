You asked your boyfriend and he told you to go ahead.  He should\u2019ve been the one to tell his dad that you were coming.  Also his dad way overreacted to you coming, which makes me question if he was tryna hide something", "NTA. Maybe the bf should have told his dad, but usually that type of a reaction is reserved for someone afraid of getting caught doing something inappropriate.", "Yeah, this was your boyfriend's mistake, not yours. You asked for permission and were told it was fine, and he neglected to tell his apparently extremely jumpy father that you'd be swinging in to grab something on the way home. The dad was probably embarrassed to have freaked out that much and overcompensated by lashing out at you. NTA.  \n\n\nI guess if this happens again in the future, either double check with your boyfriend once you hit the driveway that he's *sure* he informed his parents you were dropping in, or just politely knock if you see a light on in the house and wait for someone to let you in, key or no key.", "NTA. Dad way overreacted. Maybe he was doing something that he didn't want others to find out about.", "NTA. \"my boyfriend, who told me it was his fault and that he should\u2019ve warned his dad\"\n\nYep, it's as simple as that. Your boyfriend said it was fine, so it's not your fault. Surprising someone in their home when you don't live there is a no no, but that was your boyfriend's responsibility to manage that.", ">He said he thought I was breaking in to steal things. He was really mad and kept saying that I was intruding\n\nBurglars...don't have KEYS. Your BF's dad way overreacted, and when you corrected his initial concerns, he kept scolding and had a tantrum all over you.\n\nSomething tells me that he doesn't respect your BF as a full-grown adult, and certainly doesn't respect you, OP. Good to remember, if you two stay together and grandkids ever enter the picture.\n\nDon't fret over this OP. It's not your fault BF's dad was doing something that he didn't want anyone to interrupt...hmm. Anyway this is for your BF to handle, not you.\n\nNTA and I hope you feel better very soon!", "NTA- BF was the one who needed to alert his parents about this.", "NAH.    Your bf said this would be fine.  Dad had a strong reaction, but most people don't want randoms walking in their locked home unexpectedly.  Where I live this could get someone shot lol.  In fact, it's happened.  I know it would startle the crap out of me.\n\nYour bf obviously should have handled this better, but that was an oversight, not bad intent.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend gave you permission and the keys.  This is a spat between your boyfriend and his father.", "No offense to the other people on this thread but not every situation is hiding some deep dark secret lol. I def would've been terrified and then angry if someone unlocked and came into my house that I wasn't expecting. I don't think it was right for him to yell at you but emotions can take hold sometimes. Have your bf talk to his dad and apologise, he's right that he should've called ahead, otherwise you're definitely NTA", "NTA\n\nI suppose maybe you should have knocked before going in just in case someone was home, but it seems like a total overreaction on the Dad's part considering your BF gave you the keys and told you it was fine to go.  That's not really \"popping by randomly\".", "Absolutely NTA, you asked your bf, he told you you could and lent you his keys. I think your bf's dad was massively overreacting and was the AH here. Your bf should have warned him but still the dad was awfully rude.", "NAH except your boyfriend. \n\nIt was as easy as sending his dad a text and saying you were popping by to pick up your meds. \n\nYour boyfriends dad shouldn\u2019t have taken it out on you.", "Two possibilities here:\n\nYTA if you just went into someone else's house without knocking.\n\nNTA if you knocked and were greeted by that response.", "ESH\n\nI would *never* just walk in to someone's house without them knowing first.\n\nYou and your boyfriend should have had the foresight to let his Dad know you were stopping by.", "NTA, you got permission before you went in. \n\nEven if his Dad's reaction was warranted, which it absolutely wasn't, it would have been on your BF to let him know ahead of time, not you.", "NTA if you checked in with your boyfriend first. He should have let his parents know you were stopping by. But mainly it seems like his dad was probably doing something sketchy if he got all uppity and defensive about you being there.", "NTA your boyfriend gave you permission and keys to access the house. His fathers reaction is one often portrayed by someone who came close to getting caught. Years ago my friend had small holiday gathering at his house down in the basement which had been turned into 3 rooms one of which had a bathroom that we often used when over. I and another girl had to go so we went to open the door to the room with the bathroom to find his dad screaming at us that we didn\u2019t have permission to access that room which was super weird. We didn\u2019t even know he was down there. My friend then goes oh yeah I forgot to tell you my dad is resting in that room so you have to use the main bathroom upstairs no biggy. We still found it so weird how he reacted so angrily until we went to leave the door wasn\u2019t latched so it popped open enough to reveal the reason. His dad was full on watching porn and pleasuring himself.", "NTA - your boyfriend is right, he should have warned his dad; and his dad should have been a bit more patient and forgiving since he\u2019s really angry at his son for giving you the keys rather than at you for using them.", "NTA \n\ni don't think so no one's was at the fault tbh. Your bf dad's must have really thought that someone was breaking in as he wasn't informed earlier but still his action little bit too much.", "ESH. Your boyfriends dad for over reacting, your boyfriend for not giving his dad a heads up and you for knowing he was home and using a key that is not yours to enter the house. You should have knocked and waited for him to come to the door.", "NTA, your boyfriends father is what reddit would call an incel, but I would just call him a dick.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is the dad this jumpy about other things?", "NTA- the way his dad is overreacting makes me think he was doing something he didn\u2019t want anyone to see/know about.", "NTA. Your bf lives there too. He gave you permission to stop and grab your meds. As angry as his father got, it seems more like he was afraid you caught him doing something he shouldn't have been doing or could possibly catch him doing something he shouldn't be doing if you stopped by at some other time for some other reason.", "NTA but I'd try and talk to the dad (at least through your bf) to apologize again for giving him a shock - hopefully he didn't mean to react so angrily and if so, it would be nice to smooth things out. Obviously he shouldn't be yelling angrily at you, but I can imagine it being a nasty shock to have someone you don't know too well unexpectedly enter your house.", "how long have you been dating? I don't think you're the A, but how well your BF's dad knows you can help determine whether he's being overly cautious or an AH.   \n   \nNTA after 2.5 years if your BF's dad doesn't trust you're not breaking into their house, that's a major him problem.", "You are NOT in the wrong. You had keys and permission for a legitimate reason. BFs dad waaaay overreacted. Makes me think he had something going on there. Banging the neighbours wife or something that caused him to flip out. Your BF really fouled up by not calling his dad and appraising him of the situation. Hopefully everyone calms down takes a breath and apologizes to you. You have nothing to apologize for. NTA", "It's so bad that this was my first thought too, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. XD But yeah, he's... that's pretty jumpy.", "Bingo I had a friends dad act in a similar matter one time when I opened the door to the game room to use the bathroom in their basement my friend forgot to tell us to use the main bathroom upstairs. Really couldn\u2019t understand why his dad was so angry until later on the door never latched all the way when we went to leave it popped open enough to see he was watching the most graphic porn I have ever seen was clearly pleasuring himself.", "lol a few ppl have commented this", "Well that or he was just working and didn't expect to see or hear another person in the house so got taken by surprise - but this sub loves a theory!", "You\u2019re wrong. Some burglars have keys. They get them off the victims", "Well I don\u2019t think knocking happened at all since she was given keys from her BF to get in.", "Considering op stated he normally doesn\u2019t work at home they were not expecting him to be there.", "I didn\u2019t know he was home\u2026 he usually isnt during a weekday", "What in the post suggests she knew he was home?", "I don't get it. If he knows you're his son's GF why did he have to overreact like that especially if you're going to move in soon? NTA", "2 and a half years", "I dunno. I work from home alone most of the day and if someone came and let themselves in at an unexpected time I\u2019d be irritated at the interruption to my work and also maybe a little freaked out that something unexpected had happened involving home security. I\u2019ve had a few proper jump scares with the neighbours breaking up firewood or furniture at the back of the house where I can\u2019t see them while I\u2019m working because it sounds just like someone\u2019s trying to get into my house.\n\nThe difference is, I wouldn\u2019t stay mad about it once I\u2019d found out the explanation.", "Even his response makes no sense every one knows people who brake in do so with a key to the house. /S", "There's still no way that BF's dad didn't know it was harmless OP after one look at her. She was there to get her OWN STUFF.", "Doesn't matter. Neither of them own the house, the owners are entitled to know.", "I\u2019m sorry if I read that wrong, you said when I got there his dad was home. \nSo let me ask you this, was his car in the driveway? Because that means the person is home. Did you knock before you let yourself in? It\u2019s not your house, and I\u2019d be pretty upset if I walked out of my office to find someone in my house. Girlfriend, boyfriend, whomever. Now I\u2019m sure I would have handled it better, that\u2019s why he got the ESH but really, it\u2019s not your home, at least make it known that you\u2019re there. A shout out hello would have at least been sufficient as you opened the door.", "I knock even at my Moms house. It's called courtesy.", "When I got there, his dad was home. Her words. Knock on the door if you know he\u2019s home.", "He was probably doing something that wasn\u2019t work and was mad he almost got caught it\u2019s the only logical thing I could come up with still op is NTA.", "Yeah I\u2019d be freaked out if someone I lived with just gave the keys to someone else and gave them leave to be in the house and didn\u2019t tell me.", "I certainly never break into a house I don't have the key to!", "I\u2019d be pissed if someone who doesn\u2019t live there came in my house without knocking", "But he might have heard someone coming in, coming up these stairs, etc. That would really scare me personally if I was home at a time when I knew my family members wouldn't be there.", "They don\u2019t have a car? I\u2019m not arguing with ur ruling, I can totally accept an ESHbut ur assuming a lotta stuff lol. He takes the bus to work.", ".. or maybe she noticed AFTER she got into the house?", "Agreed. It's a nasty surprise that someone is entering the house when you don't expect there's any good reason it would be happening.\n\nNot OP's fault, but I can understand dad's reaction.", "I think this is more what he meant, rather than thinking I was here to rob him when he saw my face", "Still need to give a courtesy knock before you unlock a house that isn\u2019t yours. Even if you have the keys. What if he was laying on the couch in his birthday suit? Really, it takes 10 seconds to knock on a door, open the door, and say HELLO, is anyone here? It\u2019s not your house. My ruling stands.", "It\u2019s not her house, no matter what, she should have knocked and at the very least give a courtesy HELLO at the door before she walked in."]}
