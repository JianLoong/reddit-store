She started dating this guy (36M) about a year ago.  Their whole relationship was very tumultuous, because when they started dating, he was already planning to move across the country at some point (we live in the US), so he was quite standoffish, and never really wanted to put in a lot of effort, because he said from the beginning that he didn't want to do long distance.  Every time she talked to him about it, he would say all the right things to keep her around, and then immediately start pulling away again.  In the fall, she ended up spiraling down because she was so confused about everything, and she already has a history of depression.  All of her friends spent a lot of nights comforting her, drinking with her, and spending time with her.  He was doing nothing to help the situation.  Finally in November, she broke up with him, which all of her friends were happy about.\n\nCurrent situation:  They started dating again about a month ago.  The sale of his house is about to be finalized, and he's hoping to move by the beginning of next month.  My friend says that he seems so much better now, and they are talking about giving long distance a try, because he said he \"really wants to get to know her.\" All of her friends are sitting back just waiting for this to end badly, but none of us believe in giving advice unless asked, so we are just trying to be supportive.  Well, I guess she is self-conscious or something since no one has really given their opinions, but we were all hanging out and she asked my opinion of their relationship and it turning into long term.  I asked if she was sure, and she said yes.  So, I told her that I don't think he changed in the 4 months since she dumped him, that he is just using her as a time filler until he leaves.  And that once he moves out there, they may work on the long distance for a time, but ultimately he will start to build a life there that doesn't include her.  And then he will probably get tired of maintaining a long distance relationship, but since he isn't adult enough to end it himself, he will probably just do what he did before and start pulling away from her, and becoming more and more distant.  Then she will start spiraling down into the \"what is going on, I don't understand\" canyon (again).  And he will push her until she finally dumps him.  Then she will probably never hear from him again.  \n\nEveryone pretty much agreed with me.  She got really pissed off and said that none of us are true friends because true friends would be supportive.  She stormed out, and none of us have heard from her since.  She's just been posting a lot of quotes about relationships and friendships on social media since then, but won't respond to texts.  Did I handle this badly?

She actually probably need to hear this and especially if all of your friend group agreed. Just give her some space and time. You might go ahead and text her and just let her know that you know it was hard to hear and it wasn\u2019t your intention to upset her and then she asked for your opinion and you\u2019re just trying to do right by her.", "Real friends are supportive AND truthful.

It will probably take her some time to come to terms with it, but I hope she will remember that you are her friends and don't say/do this out of malice. Give her space, but don't isolate her. Allow her to re-enter without shame or guilt, which she probably will feel.", "NTA. You gave her what she confirmed she wanted. She likely knows what you said is true but doesn't want to accept it. Give her a bit of space. She'll come around.", "NTA. She asked for your honest opinion and just got pissed off because she didn't like what you said.

Because she asked for your honest opinion. If a friend can\u2019t give an honest opinion after being asked for one and can\u2019t take or accept it, that\u2019s on them. Not you. By default, NTA.

If this wasn't a repeat performance by someone who'd treated her like crap already, I might have suggested a gentler approach - but she needs to untangle from him.", "NTA.

True friends speak up when needed.", "NTA\n\nShe asked for your opinion, and you shared it. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nBeing having been in this situation, I recommend in the future, if you want to keep someone as a friend, you should tell them that they need to see a professional therapist about their relationship issues as you are not an expert in this topic and want them to get the best help possible. \n\nHonestly, that is what your friend actually needs - a therapist and relationship coach. Someone to tell her their professional opinion without worrying about damaging their future relationship with her or her bf.  Then when your friend tells you about their relationship issue, you can agree with what you can, and avoid the landmines - you can go back to being her friend instead of her therapist and relationship coach.", "NTA.  You never ask a question you don't want to know the answer to. She broke the one rule.", "INFO \n\nDo you acc have any reason to believe that the same will happen again?

Or if you wanted to, it should have ended at \u201cI\u2019m worried about you guys given what happened in the past, but am hopeful that it turns out ok.\u201d You just went wayyyy too deep. \n\nI think one of the most important things to remember as a friend is that you rarely, if ever, have the full picture of another\u2019s relationship. You have the relationship through her eyes, and likely the worst parts of it as very few of us go to friends to talk about the good parts of a relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
