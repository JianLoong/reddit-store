She started dating this guy (36M) about a year ago.  Their whole relationship was very tumultuous, because when they started dating, he was already planning to move across the country at some point (we live in the US), so he was quite standoffish, and never really wanted to put in a lot of effort, because he said from the beginning that he didn't want to do long distance.  Every time she talked to him about it, he would say all the right things to keep her around, and then immediately start pulling away again.  In the fall, she ended up spiraling down because she was so confused about everything, and she already has a history of depression.  All of her friends spent a lot of nights comforting her, drinking with her, and spending time with her.  He was doing nothing to help the situation.  Finally in November, she broke up with him, which all of her friends were happy about.\n\nCurrent situation:  They started dating again about a month ago.  The sale of his house is about to be finalized, and he's hoping to move by the beginning of next month.  My friend says that he seems so much better now, and they are talking about giving long distance a try, because he said he \"really wants to get to know her.\" All of her friends are sitting back just waiting for this to end badly, but none of us believe in giving advice unless asked, so we are just trying to be supportive.  Well, I guess she is self-conscious or something since no one has really given their opinions, but we were all hanging out and she asked my opinion of their relationship and it turning into long term.  I asked if she was sure, and she said yes.  So, I told her that I don't think he changed in the 4 months since she dumped him, that he is just using her as a time filler until he leaves.  And that once he moves out there, they may work on the long distance for a time, but ultimately he will start to build a life there that doesn't include her.  And then he will probably get tired of maintaining a long distance relationship, but since he isn't adult enough to end it himself, he will probably just do what he did before and start pulling away from her, and becoming more and more distant.  Then she will start spiraling down into the \"what is going on, I don't understand\" canyon (again).  And he will push her until she finally dumps him.  Then she will probably never hear from him again.  \n\nEveryone pretty much agreed with me.  She got really pissed off and said that none of us are true friends because true friends would be supportive.  She stormed out, and none of us have heard from her since.  She's just been posting a lot of quotes about relationships and friendships on social media since then, but won't respond to texts.  Did I handle this badly?

He was manipulative and abusive to everyone around him, he was a mooch who wouldn't pay for anything, and if he didn't get his way he'd start pouting and make everyone miserable until he got his way.  He could easily turn a whole crowd against you if you didn't do what he wanted and he wasn't afraid to do it.  The problem is he was also vary charismatic and aside from his manipulative pouting sessions always had a smile on his face, so everybody gave him a pass making excuses like \"it was just a joke\", \"you just need to lighten up\".

From now on I will assume they do have good friends, they're just ignoring their good advice.", "I don't know....i know a woman in therapy who this kind of stuff keeps happening to. Often the therapists don't understand narcissistic guys either. \n\nI personally think maybe op's friend needs to actually get out there and date for fun for a while rather than getting hooked into torturous situations.", "It sounds like you were a great friend! I think the thing is its a sensitive topic and to me saying \"your bf is a manipulative asshole\" is a little bit different to saying something like \"your bf is using you and now he's going to string you along and break your heart\" - the first puts the blame where it belongs and implies he treats everyone badly, while the second is probably true but it just makes the victim feel bad about themselves. Particularly if the girl hasn't had a relationship before.", "I don't think its just distance, its the combination of hot and cold and mean and nice behaviour that does it. Even abusers have to be charming sometimes or no one would want them.", "I don't think age matters much at all if you don't have the relevant relationship experience. She was clearly in love with him, you don't know what he told her to get her back, and it must have been humiliating for her to hear her friends say this stuff.", "When it comes to friendships and how you treat your friends, it does matter. Relationship experience? Sure, I give her a pass for not understanding how toxic he is (maybe). But when it comes to asking for your friends honest opinions, and then throwing a 13 year old level tantrum when you don\u2019t get the answer you want (posting quotes on social media, really??), it says a lot.", "NTA - true friends tell you the truth", "NTA. Early on in my life I learnt that people most often choose the current SO over even close friends and have stopped giving any actual advice to them. I just wait for the breakup and then offer support during the tough times. More mental peace for me this way. Post 25 most people are old enough to handle a few breaks ups. It\u2019s fine they will live.", "I\u2019m always the honest friend. If you don\u2019t want my opinion don\u2019t ask me. I\u2019ve never understood people who ask for your opinion and then get upset when you don\u2019t tell them what they want to hear. Because let\u2019s be honest they already know the truth and are just looking for someone to tell them otherwise.", "Actually i completely agree with this big ego interpretation lol. But unfortunately OP didn't say that, she described her own friend as a \"time filler\". It sounds like this could have been approached differently, with more of an emphasis on the guy's flaws.", "Agree, if two people have an intimate relationship you can guarantee there is a massive amount other people aren't aware of. It does sound like this man is manipulative and what the op said might well be true....it must have been very upsetting to hear though.", "About 5 years ago i was being bullied at work, i put inspirational quotes on social media for the first time ever as my emotions were just really high...and other adults i know going through a tough time do similar things. It's a form of self expression lol. Maybe not the best, but definitely not limited to teens. If the stuff she posted was rude and identified particular people i definitely agree that would be different."]}
