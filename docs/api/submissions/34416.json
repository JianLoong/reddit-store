You also say that you don\u2019t help with your mom because you work, but also that he asks to use your car to take her to appointments. Meaning that you\u2019re either working from home and shouldn\u2019t need the car or you\u2019re home and could be helping.

You said your brother drives a \"Front wheel drive\" car and you all live in a snowy state; I can understand if you said your brother owns a rear wheel drive car.  Either YOUR BROTHER CAN'T DRIVE or he don't want to put a lot of mileage on his car.  He is using you!  Michigan is a snowy state and half of the population here drives front wheel drive cars in the snow, sleet, rain and hail with no problems at all.

Make it a game. Get a whiteboard and write what he needs to say before borrowing the car. Change it as often as you want.

He tries to use my car really quick before I go to work.", "Start demanding the keys to his car if he's going to be out in yours. After all, you might need to use a car while he's gone. It's unfair to leave you trapped at home. I doubt he will hand over the keys, but if he does, take the car out. Make plans with friends. Go on a date. Do whatever. Never fuel it up unless you have to. He'll see the light pretty quick.\n\nBut either way, stop letting him do the work on your car. It's not free if he uses it against you. The cost of a mechanic is cheaper. And never let him borrow your car unless he hands you the keys to his. NTA", "Is he insured as a secondary driver on your car?
