We tell each other everything, Yesterday my sister said she wanted to adopt a newborn. I was confused because she is single and has never wanted kids.\n\nWhen I asked why she wants to adopt newborn babies and raise them till 8 or 9 then give them up saying she can no longer take care of them for whatever reason. I told her she was crazy and that she would be a horrible mother if she did that.\n\nShe called me an asshole and we haven't spoken since. She has been calling all our friends and family telling them I called her crazy and said she'd be a horrible mother. Now it is a series of friends and family calling to ask why I would say that me explaining what happened and them agreeing that adopting a baby just to raise it for a short while and giving it up is wrong.\n\nThis morning she called me and told me to stop airing out her dirty laundry I told her she did it first, and she asked me to apologize I told her I was not going to. I'm worried I might be the asshole for possibly ruining our relationship over this, and my wording when telling her it was a bad idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I just found out she had started the adoption process months prior, the only reason she told me was because she had put me down as a reference. She texted me to \"give me a heads up \". She thinks even if I don't agree with her I should still help her out and stand by her. I don't think I can. It would be unfair to the child to have a mother who planned to give them up.\n\nIt would be unfair to the child to feel unwanted twice. Would I be an asshole and horrible sister if I told them the reason she wanted to adopt? I'm genuinely torn. She is such a kind person, and would definitely treat the baby right. Should I just help her out? She just likes how cute babies are and wants to experience having one. I don't want to take that chance away from her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: She said she would raise them till they were a Pre-teen so i'm assuming around 8 or  9. She said she does not want to deal with \"teenage drama\" nor does she want to put them through collage university etc.\n\nShe is perfectly fine she has been in very few relationships and is uninterested in the idea of marriage/settling down to start a family. I don't know what brought this idea to her.  though this might have something to do with the fact that she has always loved cute things and would offten adopt cute cats and dogs (which she would take back after a while becasue she got tired of them)", "created_utc": 1675780342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w39no/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_would_be_a/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That kid would never be able to form healthy relationships. \n\nYou also didn't just come out and say she would be a bad mom, you reacted to her idea said that the idea is crazy and that way of parenting is not being a good parent, not that she could never or would never be a good parent.", "Good Lord, your sister is touched in the head.  Babies are not playthings.  You don't adopt a baby and give it up when they're 8 or 9.  NTA and I hope she never gets her hands on a child.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is delusional, both for the idea of giving up an adopted child and thinking she'd be approved for adoption in the first place, unless she's planning on doing so via non legal avenues. \n\nAs you said, she's the one telling people what you said to her without any context so of course you're going to explain why you said what you did to your sister.", "NTA\n\nBabies are for life - not just for Christmas. She should not be allowed to adopt to give the child up.", "NTA. When they contact you please be honest with them about your sister's intentions. Planning to adopt a child and then give them up after they have already formed an attachment is just awful. That is not fair to the child and can severely negatively impact them emotionally and mentally. Please don't let that happen to the child", "PLEASE reach out to the adoption agency to let them know what you've been told. Don't wait for them to contact you as a reference, as they may not. NTA", "NTA, but your sister is definitely leaning that way. Hopefully you being so blunt with her will make her realize how F-ed up her \u201cplan\u201d is. Stand your ground and don\u2019t apologize.", "Your sister is horrible and has absolutely no business being a mother. You shouldn\u2019t assist her with the adoption process in any way. NTA", "ETA\n\nFirstly, her for her compete lack of empathy and viewing animals and children as toys that can be discarded the moment she's bored.  She absolutely should not ever have a child in her care.  She shouldn't have a pet either.  She needs therapy and someone figuring out why she feels no empathy and thinks she can treat other living things this way.  This is not normal.  It was already bad with the animals, but thinking she can do this to a child seriously points to her needing mental help.\n\nSecondly, you for even -playing- with the idea of helping her carry this out when you know what she intends to do.  It says something about your own bizarre morals that you say you don't want to take away \"being a mother\" from her and call her a \"kind person\" since she will surely be good to the baby while it interests her.  She doesn't want to be a mother and love a child.  She wants the novelty of a new toy.  The fact that you are even considering for a moment about letting her get away with this and refuse to see her actions up until this point with her animals for what they are and insisting she's a good person is horrifying.", "NTA for telling your sister the truth. Adopting a child just to have a doll to play with for a few years is messed up.

Who\u2019s to say that she doesn\u2019t have more ill intent that you\u2019re unaware of (since you obv didn\u2019t see this coming)", "NTA tell your sister that if her goal is to cause mental damage and traumatize children there are a lot of easier options than going through the adoption process", "\"She is such a kind person, and would definitely treat the baby right.\" What kind of mental gymnastics led you to that conclusion?", "NTA Your sister is. Don\u2019t give her a reference. The children don\u2019t deserve that.", "Wow, this is bizarre. Your sister has a Disney mindset about motherhood and is actually Cruella Deville. She needed to hear that she would be a horrible mother, and you need to tell the adoption agency the same.", "NTA. This is mind-boggling.", "NTA\n\nShe should not adopt! Please don't let her abandon a child at an age they will remember being abandoned.  Why doesn't she foster?", "NTA you sister is actually not a kind person at all. She\u2019s disgustingly selfish. \n\nYou need to tell the adoption agency her plan. It is not, in anyway, okay. It\u2019s not only morally wrong on every imaginable level it\u2019s completely insane.", "What?  Omg!  No!  That's just wrong on so many levels, and if you get any calls, please, please, please inform the agency of what her plan is.  I have no words.
