We tell each other everything, Yesterday my sister said she wanted to adopt a newborn. I was confused because she is single and has never wanted kids.\n\nWhen I asked why she wants to adopt newborn babies and raise them till 8 or 9 then give them up saying she can no longer take care of them for whatever reason. I told her she was crazy and that she would be a horrible mother if she did that.\n\nShe called me an asshole and we haven't spoken since. She has been calling all our friends and family telling them I called her crazy and said she'd be a horrible mother. Now it is a series of friends and family calling to ask why I would say that me explaining what happened and them agreeing that adopting a baby just to raise it for a short while and giving it up is wrong.\n\nThis morning she called me and told me to stop airing out her dirty laundry I told her she did it first, and she asked me to apologize I told her I was not going to. I'm worried I might be the asshole for possibly ruining our relationship over this, and my wording when telling her it was a bad idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I just found out she had started the adoption process months prior, the only reason she told me was because she had put me down as a reference. She texted me to \"give me a heads up \". She thinks even if I don't agree with her I should still help her out and stand by her. I don't think I can. It would be unfair to the child to have a mother who planned to give them up.\n\nIt would be unfair to the child to feel unwanted twice. Would I be an asshole and horrible sister if I told them the reason she wanted to adopt? I'm genuinely torn. She is such a kind person, and would definitely treat the baby right. Should I just help her out? She just likes how cute babies are and wants to experience having one. I don't want to take that chance away from her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: She said she would raise them till they were a Pre-teen so I'm assuming around 8 or  9. She said she does not want to deal with \"teenage drama\" nor does she want to put them through college university etc.\n\nShe is perfectly fine she has been in very few relationships and is uninterested in the idea of marriage/settling down to start a family. I don't know what brought this idea to her.  though this might have something to do with the fact that she has always loved cute things and would often adopt cute cats and dogs (which she would take back after a while because she got tired of them)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I contacted the adoption agency to tell them, she will no longer be allowed to adopt. My sister found out what I did and is really angry. I don't want my sister to hate me and I want her to be happy but this was going too far. I hope to get her some help so we can find the root cause of why she might be acting this way. I know my sister is an amazing and kind person regardless of the situation though I can admit what she wanted to do was wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: after reading some of the comments I think you all have the wrong idea about my sister, she ***is*** a kind and amazing person who loved the animals enough to give them up when she felt the fact that they weren't as cute could affect her love and care for them. Everyone makes mistakes. My sister is not crazy or a psychopath she is very compassionate with me so I would know.

My younger sister is crazy and obsessed she said she would not allow me to adopt because she didn't want to lose me for a long time.

Your sister obviously needs help because there is no way that she doesn't understand how wrong that is. Children are not toys or puppies.

Children are not toys to be set aside when they ate no longer cute or little.", "Wow. The fact that she thought that this was okay at all is disturbing, and the edit saying that she is willing to give up animals when she's sick of them doesn't make her sound better or even compassionate. How about don't adopt a baby of any kind if you're not willing to make the lifelong commitment? I'm glad you called the adoption agency and told her what she said.

But idk that attitude in general is absolutely out the gate and pretty troubling. Is she unaware how much psychological damage that would cause a child? \n\nObviously NTA and I think we all appreciate you blocking her from becoming an adoptive parent.", "\"Should I just help her out? She just likes how cute babies are and wants to experience having one. I don't want to take that chance away from her.\" WT-everloving-F did I just read? Your sister has the maturity of a 2 year old (if we're  being generous) and you're not far behind. Children. Aren't. Toys. They aren't fluffy baby bunnies to take in, play around with, post selfies on IG and then just GIVE THEM UP when they aren't so cute. You know what isn't cute? Baby diarrhea. Baby vomit. Not sleeping for days because baby is hungry. Baby is teething. Toodlers drawing all over your walls (sorry,  mom) and destroying everything you own. None of that shit is cute. So if your sister thinks she's going to get a \"cute baby\" and just keep it til it's less cute, lemme tell you, babies can get uncute in zero seconds. This shit is how child abuse and infanticide happen.  I would be shocked if a single woman with her viewpoint would pass the adoption process, but just nip it in the bud. She's in her 20s, plenty of time to have a baby and ruin its life all on her own, without dragging orphans into it.\n\nETA: I meant toddlers but toodlers totally works too", "NTA. I hope you can encourage your sister to get the mental health help, she desperately needs. How horrific it would be for any child she would adopt.", "NTA ur sis needs help tho", "NTA. But I\u2019m heading towards to ESH. Your sister isn\u2019t a good person and honestly it is messed up to adopt a baby then \u201cgive it back\u201d whatever the f**k that means.", "She'd probably give the baby up after a few weeks when she realizes how hard newborns are. Like what is wrong with this woman?", "Exactly!!! I\u2019m kinda heading towards ESH because she is obviously blind to who her sister is and she isn\u2019t kind or sweet", "First and foremost, I think you have a confused understanding of what a kind and caring person is (which worries me about your own welfare to be honest - hopefully you are just blinded by sisterly love). If she were truly kind and caring, knowing her own flaws, she'd go volunteer at a humane society instead of voluntarily abandoning an animal for purely aesthetic reasoning. Or she'd foster animals (in which case the animals aren't meant to be with her long term). \n\nSecondly, there was very little chance she would have actually adopted a newborn - first because she doesn't seem to have the propensity to stick with caring about a living being for very long and would have given up on the adoption process before it got very far, especially given she was waiting to adopt a newborn as newborns are the most coveted age group for adoption and there is a super long wait list for it (you really have to be super committed to make it through the arduous process of adoption - assuming you are doing it legally); second - her lack of commitment would definitely have shown up during the process of adoption, even if she had lied to the agency initially.\n\nThird, animals and children are living beings, that at the very least deserve commitment unless there's extenuating circumstances. She really should be blacklisted from ever adopting an animal again. And certainly should be on a blacklist for every adoption and foster system in the country - as bad as what she was doing to the animals, what she was planning to do to a child is 100x worse - and that's not a caring person, that's a cruel one who's doing it knowingly. What was her plan to do with the child once they had passed their child phase? Also, your sister has clearly never been around a newborn or a toddler. Toddlers are like teenagers without the hormones. Infants and toddlers are a ton of work, physical and emotional. You can't just put them down some place and feed them when you occasionally remember to do so! She wouldn't be an aunt dropping in to pinch a cheek, say aww how cute, and then walk away! She would be a parent who chose to be a mother, which means sacrificing, adapting, loving for the entirety of her life - and not giving up when the child stops being \"cute\"... Which would last all of 5 seconds for her once she's had to go a few days without proper sleep, feedings every couple of hours per day, constantly changing diapers and dealing with perpetual crying (because that's what newborns do).", "What the fuck", "Guess what? The drama starts at 4. Some 4 year olds act exactly like teenagers or worse", "I mean, I guess it's kind because she'd probably neglect the animal if she continued to keep it. But yeah she should not adopt. Maybe she could do temporary foster care... But something seems off about her", "The way she says it really comes off as she got baby animals (probably dogs, honestly) and then got rid of them once they no longer looked like their baby form. Which is just, super fucked up regardless. She definitely should rehome an animal if she doesn't want to care for it, but doing it multiple times is borderline psychotic", "Right? I wanted a bunny so bad as a kid. Finally got one and realized they weren't as great as I thought. I stuck it out and cared for my bunny but when I left for college my parents rehomed her because they didn't want to care for her. I was happy the bunny got a new home and decided I never wanted a bunny again.  I can't imagine adopting over and over again just to get that baby animal fix.. like WTF", "Yeah... I see it a lot with parrots. People ditch them not after they get 'not cute' because after they fledge there's barely any difference between that and an adult. But they ditch them once they hit puberty because they don't *act* like a baby anymore. I see it allll the time. People get a bird, and ditch it after a year because it established boundaries. And then they get another baby bird. Rinse. Repeat. It's endless, and so so frustrating.", "absolutely NTA.\n\nyour sister is CRAZY. like that, in uppercase. why would you want to do that. literally why. it's super selfish. she's definitely not responsible enough for that labour and now i'm finding myself so worried about those poor kids.\nthe fact that you called her out like that is just implying that you are trying to help her open her eyes for once. do not feel guilty for this, she really needs to hear it.", "NTA- but regarding your edit, NO your sister is not a kind or amazing person. There is something terribly wrong with her for her to think her plan was okay.", ">\"she is a kind and amazing person who loved the animals enough to give them up when she felt the fact that they weren't as cute could affect her love and care for them\"\n\nSweetie, baby, this is not the compassion you think it is. That's still selfish as fuck. Your sister is abdicating responsibility for someone once they've outlived their cuteness for her. SAME WITH THE THEORETICAL CHILD.\n\nRemember, you don't see someone's truest character in how they behave with you. You see it with how they behave with the lowest ranking people. The worst people see foster children and rescue animals as disposable. That's your girl. \n\nNTA, but I need you to see reality about your sister.", "Your sister would probably be a great person to foster animals. Temporary home kind of deal. She honestly does sound unhinged simply because she actually thought adopting a child and giving them up was a GOOD idea. Not only that, she started the process and was relatively close to succeeding. You've got some blinders on, but I'm VERY VERY glad you called and got her banned from adopting. You did the absolute right thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA Did you...ask her why she would want to do that?
