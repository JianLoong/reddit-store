I mentioned that I thought it was not a great sign that she hadn\u2019t shared our happy news with her Facebook friends. My thought was dismissed as she said she never really uses it anymore. So I let it go. Several months later I have noticed she is using it quite a bit now so I had a look at her account using a friends account and not only has she added new photos of herself , her status is still single. I mentioned this tonight and got told to stop sulking about nothing. \nSo my question is, am an the a**hole for snooping on her account and being offended by what I found or is she the a**hole for not respecting my concerns as to the motive for this?", "created_utc": 1697494316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179ic7t/aita_for_calling_my_fianc\u00e9_out/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I use my Facebook daily. I can tell you that many people don't update their relationship status for many reasons.\nMy question for you is, \"What's the big deal?\" Do you think maybe she's looking for other men? Do you trust her? Why the snooping? If they're are trust issues then you need to resolve them, NOW. Before you get married.", "YTA I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d know how to change my status on FB. When I do use any social media I\u2019m def not thinking about which parts of my profile need updating.", "Slight YTA. No one updates those statuses. It\u2019s Facebook. Not real life. Have you bought a ring she likes to wear? That\u2019s real life.", "NTA - it\u2019s ok to say, hey how come you are still listed as single on FB??  Telling you she doesn\u2019t use it much, or on the second time you asked, stop sulking about nothing are not answers to your question.\n\nSo one has to wonder, why is someone who is supposed to be sharing your life with you, not want to be truthful about their status on FB??  Why would she just say, I\u2019ll get flooded with adds or whatever?  What is she just blowing you off on what should be a simple question??\n\nI\u2019d she afraid to tell you something ?  Or does she believe you are not entitled to know her reasons?\n\nI think what is bothering you more is her answers to your question, not the question.  She is trying to make it about the question itself rather than answering the question.\n\nMarriage is about communication and working through issues and trusting your partner so you can be honest about everything.", "I don't know that YTA, necessarily, but I would say try not to worry about it too much.  She's engaged to you and living with you, after all!  Unless there are other signs of concern, don't go down this insecurity rabbit hole - it'll just make you feel so much worse for no reason.", "ESH. You for snooping, her for not acknowledging your feelings. \n\nNow, legally speaking, she is still unmarried in the eyes of the law, so it\u2019s not wrong for her to say she\u2019s single. But I could see how it could rub you the wrong way because there is the \u201cin a relationship\u201d option. \n\nI think it\u2019s less about the snooping but more about what this says about your trust in her. Do you find yourself often questioning her motives or behavior? Does she meet your communication needs? Does she hide the relationship in other settings, or just FB? What makes it important for you for her to acknowledge your relationship in this way? What makes you feel like you have to snoop to get this info instead of just asking her? \n\nMaybe try to have a talk about what makes this important for you for her to put it on Facebook, and understand why it\u2019s important to her not to post it. \n\n\nIt could be a privacy thing, could be wanting to maintain some version of independence, who knows. Maybe she doesn\u2019t see the point since you\u2019re not also on Facebook. My partner isn\u2019t on FB but I have one, and I haven\u2019t always had my relationship status on there either. \n\nMaybe she doesn\u2019t want to be defined by her relationship with a man on Facebook. \n\nMaybe she has friends on there that she thinks don\u2019t need to know her status. For example she might have coworkers on there, and not everyone wants to share their relationship status to colleagues. \n\nMaybe she has an ex on there who she thinks might harass you if they found out she was in a new relationship. \n\nMaybe she can\u2019t figure out the stupid maze of Facebook settings to actually change her status. It sounds simple, but there have been times when it\u2019s taken me ages to change something, and I\u2019ve been using FB since the early days back in 2004. \n\n\nBut I can\u2019t explain it to you. You need to ASK HER directly and quit with the snooping.", "NTA, she wants to keep her options open or have some validation with men hittong her up on Facebook. You are engaged and there is no nuance like at the beginning of a relationship. It's normal that you want people to know she is engage to you.", "YTA. Believe it or not, Facebook is not the end all be all. Unless she's actively hiding the relationship from people, or you have proof that she's using this FB account to find other men, then who cares what her FB relationship status says? I know plenty of people who just never update it because /their life doesn't revolve around social media./ You're severely overreacting, and sounds like you need to work on your insecurities.", "I get the concern....if you were a teenager, not a 54 year old...Man up pal, YTA.", "Question:\n\nDoes she use IG regularly?\n\nAre her accounts linked?\n\nAnything I post on IG also posts to fb. So it might look like I'm uploading to fb regularly when in fact, I'm not using it. So, it's altogether possible that she actually doesn't use fb often.\n\nMore importantly, this is such a dumb hill to die on. Do her friends know about your happy news? If so, who cares about strangers on fb. \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. Its fucking facebook.", "Yta.\n When I had fb, I kept my personal life...personal. There's nothing wrong with that. It's just Facebook.", "My rule of thumb for situations like this. Listen to your gut. What\u2019s it telling you right now? My brother is engaged and his Facebook status still says \u201csingle\u201d. However, he hasn\u2019t posted or used Facebook since probably 2018. The fact that she still uses it, you confronted her about it multiple times, and she still hasn\u2019t changed it is slightly concerning to. Overall, it sounds like a petty thing to get upset about, but given the circumstances I too would be slightly concerned. I\u2019d sit her down, tell her it really bothers you (if it does) and let her explain her reasoning for why it still says single. You guys are about to spend the rest of your lives together, communication is key. If you can\u2019t talk about something as simple as this, maybe she isn\u2019t your person. Just some thoughts. Always listen to your gut. Best of luck friend", "Nta . If you're planning to be married you need to be able to come to your future spouse when something bothers you.  Your fianc\u00e9e is the asshole for not being up front with you on why she is portraying herself as single . If she truly wants to be single she needs to tell you so instead of wasting your time . I'd be hurt if someone didn't acknowledge me and I'd want to know why if that someone was going to be my spouse. I wanted to add that snooping is digging through someone's drawers or going through their phone.  You viewed her page publicly from someone else's account. She publicly wants everyone to know she's \"single\" . It sucks she'd rather play games then woman up and tell you the real reason behind it. She can't  commit to being with someone in a facebook status can she really commit to someone in real life?.", "YTA. I can\u2019t believe I had to double check this post and realized I wasted time reading about a 54 y/o being upset that he\u2019s not Facebook official", "YTA. Its just facebook. If she changes her status shes going to get bombed with tons of adds (its their algorithm). For someone that doesnt \"use Facebook \" you sure get hurt by it.", "ESH- \nIt takes a moment to change a status, she doesnt even have to make it a public announcement frankly. So it could've been an easy fix when you asked about it when she was using it.\n\nBut you're stalking her account using someone elses, either you trust her or you don't. Is the app you don't even use gonna be your hill to die on? Cause its about a relationship status for the sake of social media. \n\nI assume since your engaged to be wed with her, that her family/friends know an will inevitably be invited. So are you more concerned shes using a single status for the sake of meeting someone else? Or ?", "I honestly worry for your health as you seem to be putting a whole lot of stock in what you see on **Facebook**, of all places.\n\n***Facebook***.\n\nYTA.\n\nIt is **Facebook**.\n\nLet it go.", "YTA\n\nIf you think she's using Facebook to cheat on you, let me assure you there are far easier methods and app to find hookups.", "Dude, you're 54.  Not 13.  It's Facebook.  I'm pretty confident her friends know she is engaged.  Let it go.\n\nYTA", "YTA Of all the things to worry about in life, your partners's \"status\" on Facebook is pretty low on the list.", "If she knows it hurts your feelings she should just change it. However, snooping is usually not cool. You have to wonder why she played the sulking card, women are often master manipulators (at your age I\u2019m sure you know that). Well good luck, and oh, YNTAH. Not sure about her\ud83e\uddd0", "Maybe take the time to explain how this makes you feel.  BUT Before you do, explore why it makes you feel this way.  I am sure if you communicate it clearly and without emotion, she will emphasize with your feelings.\n\nCommunication is key to successful relationships. Look at this as a learning opportunity. \n\n\nI wouldn't call you an Asshole, but I would call you sensitive and her uniformed.\n\nIf you have that conversation and she does not do  this little gesture or is unwilling to come up with a compromise,  knowing why it upsets you, good luck with bigger issues.\n\nThen I would fully say NTA.", "1st of all, the shaming over snooping is silly. You have every right to do your due diligence. 2nd, your concerns are silly. Who changes their Facebook status anymore? 3rd, if you think she\u2019s cheating keep snooping until you\u2019re sure she is or she isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t listen to these self-righteous perfect people who clutch their pearls about it.", "It's not snooping.  It's a reasonable thing to wonder why she lists herself as single.  If you think she isn't all the way in then you need to have a deeper conversation about THAT.  If you think she IS still all in, then her FB status shouldn't really matter.   Your feelings do matter and it isn't a crime to let her know how you feel about it.  I'm going with NTA although it is really close to NAH.  \n\nThe petty person in me wants you to start a FB page and list yourself as single just to see if it would bother her.  But, sigh, that might be childish....", "NTA\n\nturn about's fair play so open a Facebook account and keep sharing random crap whilst waiting to see how long it takes her to moan that you're listed as Single.", "I mean neither are the AH, if I was engaged I'd certainly want to someone to show that on their profile ( personal preference) but I know alot of people aren't big on putting information on fb as it can be pretty invasive  on there.\n\nMaybe try think of a compromise for both of you", "NTA- That's clearly a red flag if she's still posting or keeping her status as \"single\", when she knows very well she has a partner. If she is not willing to change her status or getting defensive about it, I would re-think the relationship.", "You\u2019re both the asshole.", "NTA. Immediate dump. She doesn\u2019t respect you.", "NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t see anything ominous is going on here. She probably just forgot to change her Facebook settings. Lots of people\u2019s profiles reflect their lives when they first joined the platform. And since Facebook friends tend to be people one knows in RL (as opposed to Twitter and Instagram), there isn\u2019t much incentive to review profile settings regularly.", "She\u2019s looking for a better offer. Are you in any of her pictures? I\u2019ll bet not. Move on.", "No you are not AH. Just may be this is one way relationship and just may be you are a place holder until something better shows up. Of course, these are speculation,   May be nothing may be something.  Just keep your eye open.  Good luck.", "I\u2019m seeing a lot of females replying that YTAH, I\u2019m a guy 42m, I don\u2019t think you are, but it\u2019s also unlikely that she hasn\u2019t changed the status because she wants to be with other guys. If she knew how this made you feel and, without she her self feeling offended, I\u2019m sure she would change it. It\u2019s such a simple little thing, it should be easy for her just to do and mend your hurt feelings, and I suppose a person could make the same argument for her side by saying it\u2019s a little thing, just let it go. At the end of the day, we as partners should always try and be good to each other and take the other\u2019s feelings into account. I think her changing it means more to you then not changing it means to her, or at least it should. Just change the status if you\u2019re happy to be marrying this man, it would mean the world to him! Unless for some reason not changing means the world to you, but then I\u2019d like to ask why?\ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\uddd0", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
