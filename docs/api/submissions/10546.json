{"id": 10546, "submission_id": "1181eu8", "title": "AITA for calling my gay friend free conversion therapy?", "selftext": "I (27M) have a friend who's gay, Ryan (27M). Ryan and I are basically like brothers because we met in foster care at 9 and always kept in touch. When Ryan and I were 23, he started dating this man called Allen (then 18, now 22M). Most of our friends were a little weirded out by the age gap but Ryan told us that it was normal in the gay community. Allen is bisexual which is important to the story.\n\nAllen was genuinely a very nice kid. He was very loving towards Ryan and also pretty well off so he helped Ryan out financially too. I genuinely believed they had the perfect relationship and they ended up eloping a few months into their relationship. Their marriage unfortunately ended when Ryan decided he wanted to move to New York to get know his biological mother and he didn't tell Allen until a month before because, in his own words, he had fallen out of love with him and didn't know how to break up any other way. Ryan did, and still does, have a tendency to get into relationships and move very fast by moving in together or getting engaged and then dumping them a few months/years later when he freaks out about how fast they moved so that's basically what happened to Allen. Allen was 20 at the time and it absolutely devastated him. I felt horrible for him and I met up with him from lunch a week after Ryan had left where he told me that he would never date a man again. He had a religious upbringing so he believed what happened with Ryan was his punishment and he was going to stick to women from now on because of that.\n\n\nI recently ran into Allen again and we grabbed a coffee together to catch up. I jokingly asked him if he was still not dating men and he said that he was sticking to his word and told me he had a girlfriend. Later on that day, Ryan called me and I told him I ran into Allen. Ryan thought Allen was overreacting when he said that he wouldn't date men anymore but when I told him Allen was with a woman, he found it hilarious. I said, word for word \"you were basically free conversion therapy for him\". He didn't find that funny and he hung up on me. He sent me a text later saying that it wasn't my place to make that joke and I was making light of the trauma of gay people in conversion therapy.\n\nI immediately apologized and I said that I didn't mean it like that, and I meant it like Ryan had traumatized Allen out of dating men, which is something Allen has said before. He refused to accept my apology until I say that what I said was wrong but I don't think it was after I clarified what I meant. Ryan put Allen through a lot of emotional trauma and no one has ever called him out for it before which I think is wrong.

ESH  I wouldn't apologize though.", "ESH. \n\nRyan sounds like a jerk and you're right that he should be called out for his shitty behavior and treatment of Allen.\n\nBut if you meant to say Ryan traumatized Allen out of dating men, you should have actually said that. Conversion therapy is not funny, it is psychological and often physical torture targeted at a vulnerable community, and it's certainly not your place to joke about it.", "NTA. \n\nYou're not making light of the trauma of others, you're making fun of your friend with (very) dark humor.\n\nHe pretending to be offended in the name of others is his way to avoid self-reflection.", "Gay lad here. I\u2019m very much a \u2018as long as the joke is funny\u2019 sorta person, so NTA - unless he himself had been through conversion therapy, if so yes it\u2019s a bit uncalled for.", "NTA. It's great that you checked Ryan on his behavior--that's one thing friends are for! \n\nAnd you're not responsible for the batshit nonsense that \"conversion therapy\" sadly puts so many kids through. It's an evil of the world, sure, but so are so many things, and making jokes about them that don't condone them is one way society processes large-scale trauma. \n\nIt'd be a totally different thing if you were making fun of people who've been through conversion therapy, but the meat of your joke is \"this ridiculous thing is ridiculous,\" and the butt of the joke is your good friend who you're trying to get to see the wrongness of their actions.\n\nRyan is not actually offended by the subject of your joke. He's embarrassed because he does feel shame about his actions, but is running from the shame still. You can check back in with him and let him know you still love his friendship, but his treatment of romantic partners is something he should think more about. If he's regularly misrepresenting what he wants in relationships, and freaking out when they turn into things he doesn't want, that's not a good pattern for him either.", "ESH\n\nIt was a shitty joke about a practice with a horrific history and he\u2019s right; you might as well throw in a holocaust joke tbh.

He's clearly been a dick in relationships, so I understand why you make that comment, but your joke minimises what a horrendous experience conversion therapy is. Not to mention it's really not your place to make that joke if you're not LGBTQ+. You should make a genuine apology about the conversion therapy comment specifically, if you haven't already, and do some research into how fucked up that entire process is.", "Nta but I'm not entirely sure I understand the problem. He shouldn't take a joke so seriously from someone he's known so long. Maybe that's been a problem he's had since childhood but he should know you better", "NAH\n\nYou made a joke, it fell wrong, you apologized. However, that's where it gets fuzzy to me. \n\n>I immediately apologized and I said that I didn't mean it like that, and I meant it like Ryan had traumatized Allen out of dating men\n\n>He refused to accept my apology until I say that what I said was wrong but I don't think it was after I clarified what I meant\n\nYou said you were sorry, but you also repeated you did nothing wrong. So you did not really apologized from what i understand here. You are right to call Ryan out on his behavior, but making jokes might not be the best way.", "NAH. I think your friend deserves calling out for treating the people in relationships with him so poorly, he left Allen in a cruel fashion and seems to casually hurt the people he\u2019s with constantly. I also think that comparing him leaving his partners abruptly, to gay conversion therapy where they horrifically abuse kids and tell them that they are disgusting sinful abominations, is a stretch too far and I see why Ryan didn\u2019t like it.", "ESH here, what a mess. Your \"joke\" wasn't funny and makes light of the very real trauma experienced by people who've avtually endured ct. Ryan sounds like a gigantic asshole who plays fast and loose with people's feelings and has no issues upending the lives of persons he purported to care about.  And poor Allen (n.t.a.) just sounds confused af but i doubt anyone can blame him after ryan used him up and threw him away.", "nTA", "Soft YTA because your friend has a point that I agree with - you're making light of kids who've been through the hells of conversion therapy and that's not a joke.

YTA because you know ryan and should know what kinda humor he enjoys... but also NTA cause nothing happens when people are offended and its not your job to care about not offending people when making a joke, because the intent wasn't to hurt but make him lauph its his fault and his fault alone weather he was offended but no joke is offensive imo because comedy cant be offensive", "NTA, its not deep", "Conversion therapy is a form of violent, bigoted abuse. I get that you think it's funny, but people die because of conversion therapy. The physical, mental, and emotional trauma involved in having your sexuality and/or gender forcibly conditioned out of you isn't the same as being in a relationship with a shitty person. \n\nYTA.
