You're not obligated to suffer in silence with no support. Telling a close friend you can trust to be discreet isn't the same as outing him to a community etc out of spite. The act of betrayal he has done to you is one of the most cruel things a person can experience. He wasted a significant amount of your youth and life admitting he knew it would end when his parents died. I hope you have family or a solid support group of friends who can help you pick up the peices. So sorry OP.", "NTA. I'm going to probably be downvoted for this by people not willing to read or give thought to my reasoning, but that's their problem. While you shouldn't have outed your soon-to-be ex, you had just found out that he's been lying to you, daily, for more than half of your life. It also sounds like he had a vasectomy without your knowledge, so I'm wondering if the two of you had planned on having children and then you were led to believe that he was sterile. All of the time you spent with this **complete stranger**, you could have been spending with an honest man. I don't know how anyone could fault you for reacting the way that you have.   \n\n\nI wouldn't recommend writing a facebook post about this man's confessions or anything, but telling one person who asked for clarification is not the end of his world. You are, by far, not an idiot. You're a person suffering through a lot of anguish right now. I'm sorry that you're having to endure this. Your situation and his are not comparable, and if anyone tries to say otherwise, then they don't even want to try to understand your perspective.", "Sweetheart YOU ARE NTA!!! Your husband doesn't get to drop this bomb and then have you shut up and get no support. Are you meant to sit in silence till he decides it's time for you to tell someone, like you needing support isn't essential right now.\n\nTell his friend to fuck off, this man has used you, deprived you and lied to you for 20 years!! Where is the sympathy for you. Why don't you deserve support and frankly if he is worried about anyone else finding out he might want to look into why he doesn't trust his own wife. Anyone calling you an AH need to give their heads a wobble and understand that yes people should be able to live their true self without harm but it doesn't give them right to go on and harm another.", "It's not like you blasted him on social media, or started calling everyone you know to tell them. He involved the friend and his wife when he went to them and told them that you had kicked him out. You told them why, just like you would if he had been cheating on you (although I wouldn't be at all confident that he hasn't). Also, I feel like he gave up any right to extra consideration from you by lying to you for 20 fucking years and building your long-term marriage on that lie. He sucks and can deal with the consequences. NTA", "NTA. I am sorry for what you are going through. I can not imagine the pain that you are going through after finding out that your whole relationship has been a lie and that your husband has deceived you all this time about who he really is. I also don't blame you for confinding in a friend he told you out of the blue, and, being deeply shocked and hurt, you needed to talk to someone.", "Absolutely NTA. He left you. He lied to you. He had decades to prepare for this. You get to process this how you need to and you get to tell the truth.", "Nta. Did you want kids and he did not? He wasted your life with his lie. Fuck him.", "NTA Your husband used you as a beard. He was wrong.", "Well generally outing people is bad, but were you just supposed to sit there with nowhere to vent your grief and anger? Sure, it might have been better to vent to somebody who didn't know your husband at all, but it sounded pretty spontaneous.\n\nYour outing him to one close friend is way less of a violation than his allowing you to live a lie for all of those years. NTA.", "NTA your marriage cannot go forward with this revelation. its time to seek divorce", "This infuriates me! When someone dupes their partner into believing they're something they're not! NTA", "NTA. He paid you no respect for 20 years, why does he deserve it from you now?", "NTA why is his coming out a secret you have to keep. The closet door is officially open. You guys act like being gay is a bad thing. Painful as it all may be, being out is a good thing for him. Too bad he never had the guts to mention it 20 yrs ago but whatever.", "NTA at all. He lied to you for DECADES. What he did is indefensible. \n\nI'm so sorry this happened.", "Don't let anyone tell you how to behave after a huge life shattering event like that. You get to act however you want (legally of course lol). NTA make sure you get a therapist or some mental health help and get it early.", "NTA. He wasted 20+ years of your life and expected you to be ok with that.", "you are NTA and you need and deserve support. It would be wrong to vindictively make the news public, but this is NOT just his news to tell. Your marriage ended suddenly in a grotesque betrayal. He knowingly exploited you for his own safety and comfort. This isn't even a case of him coming to the realization that he was gay later in life, he always knew and always planned to leave you! So no, the typical \"You never out someone\" rules don't apply here. You are allowed to get support and I would expect that HIS FRIEND and his friend's wife are going to be discreet and not run around telling everyone, so you haven't exactly posted this in the local coffeeshop for all to see. And even if they do, he forfeited the right to have this secret kept when he made the choice to deceive you like this.", "NTA", "Nta he doesn\u2019t get to put that all on you. It isn\u2019t your secret to bare and the fact it all just happened means you\u2019re still processing. You get to be human and be upset and vengeful. Did you also just find out he had a vasectomy? Had you both not planned on children or was that a decision he made and hide?", "NTA. It was a painful shock and him staying at a friend's is a temporary 'move'. Let the dust settle. Perhaps you can be on better terms one day, or perhaps not. Time will tell. \n\nYou shouldn't have outed him in your shock but he (AH x infinity) shouldn't have deceived you and lied to you YOUR ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP.. Your whole adult life, sex life and adult choices have been built on a lie \u2014 he never told you out of respect for you, just now that his parents are dead so he can be free. Ask anyone who judges you if they've ever gone through that.  \n\nOuting him only to his close supportive friend when he now wants to be free and himself is NOTHING compared to intentionally deceiving you in every aspect of your relationship and shared life for over 2 decades because of his mummy and daddy issues \n\nINFO Did you want kids or did he say no to kids? You knew about the vasectomy?", "As a gay man, you are totally in the clear on this!  NTA. I feel for you husband, but there is no way either of you can change any part of this. You are entitled to be angry. Furious, even.  Kicking him out was a fair thing to do.  You aren't responsible for keeping him in the closet.  If his friend had the nerve to call you, that means he already knew and was helping you friend deceive you all these years. Maybe he is even a lover, who knows.  You are entitled to tell your friends for support.  He is not entitled to deprive you of the emotional support you need just to protect his lies. I say that as a gay man.  I wouldn't go around telling people who don't need to know or who you have no relationship with.  I would ask this man that claims you outed him how long he know you husband was guy and why he thought it was ok to let you live a lie.", "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A long time ago, we discussed children, and he categorically stated that he didn't want them. I never had a strong desire to be a mother, so I agreed. However, upon reflection, I'm not sure if I would have wanted children even if he hadn't mentioned anything. At the time, I started taking birth control, and he used condoms. I think he did this as a precaution because he didn't want to risk having children in any way. However, I'm not really sure how long ago he had the vasectomy or if he continued to have exams to check its effectiveness. I believe not, as we spent a lot of time together, but I truly don't have that information now. I would also like to thank everyone for their support. I made this post to vent, and I am really grateful for all the support from all of you.

You are the only person here who had a major loss of autonomy! He only lost the chance to tell a single person his truth - that doesn't even touch what he did to you. He lived 20 years with you, lied to your face every time he touched you or said he loved you, and made it impossible for you to make an informed choice about your future. You have to grieve DECADES of your life because he wasn't brave enough to tell the truth. He could've cut his parents off and lived his true life as soon as he realized he was planning to wait for his parents' death to be happy. Any decent person wouldnt put someone they care for through this. Instead of dealing with the reality that his parents *did not truly love the real him*, he chose to basically live in a delusion until he wouldn't have to make the hard choice. He chose to sacrifice *your life* instead of cutting his parents off. He is not a redeemable person, he used you. Who cares if ONE person finds out he's gay before he gets the chance to tell them \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f hell of a lot better than making someone be your beard for 20 years and then throwing them away with zero warning as soon as mommy and daddy arent in the picture", "Not to insert myself into your situation,I just wanted to let you know you're not alone and there's people out there who understand, my partner of nearly 10 years (nowhere near as bad as your situation) but after we had a child, they became extra distant until there was barely a connection between us, technically I ended things but it was after telling them  we needed to make big changes or it wouldn't work, and they said they didn't see a need to change so it just ended .. then... they came out as trans... A few weeks after we broke up and it was so hard as everyone assumed I must have known that and that it must have been the reason we broke up... When I had no idea coz they were always such a closed book despite me being open minded and accepting of everyone... I think I'd have even been ok with it if they came out to me while we were together. The way people treated me when they thought I broke up with them for being trans was disgusting and I never opened up about anything I'd gone through with them out of fear that they were sort of protected by everyone for what they'd announced and I was not allowed a say or have any feelings in the matter because the struggle was theirs, but I felt like I'd just spent the last 10 years with a stranger .. they don't see our son coz they're off living their new life, and I just had to pickup the pieces of realising they'd used me as a companion and front for the rest of the world until they were ready...  and just cut me off emotionally until things ended instead of being up front with me. I tell you this because I never opened up to anyone in my life about it past the initial shock of the announcement because it was all about how \"they must have been struggling\" ... So please know you're not the AH for saying what you had to say, I regret being so submissive in the situation out if fear of being disrespectful, I bother it all up, and you're not the AH for feeling betrayed and angry and reacting. What I would say now is that you need to put him behind you as best you can and have the best fresh start you possibly can away from him and those shitty friends.

He dug this hole (and probably felt like he dug it deeper and deeper every day), and he probably feels guilty, extremely so. He knows he \"stole\" your best years and your security. He knows he in some ways wasted his own. Both of you are hurting and you lashing out is extremly understandable. In a perfect world you wouldn't have outed him, but when in pain I get it (I don't think he will blame you for it later down the line either). You are both human and life is messy.

This is my first post on Reddit, and English is not my native language; I apologize for any mistakes. My name is Anne (F47), and I have been married to my husband David (M48) for over 20 years. We met during college and quickly started dating. He proposed to me shortly after graduation, and I couldn't have been happier. He's an only child; my in-laws paid for the whole wedding and even gave us a house as a gift. He was an excellent husband. We had sex regularly, had a cat, and traveled a lot.\r  \n\r  \nThree months ago, David's parents died in a car accident. Understandably, he was devastated and fell into a deep depression after the loss. I provided all the support I could, but he was distant, though I understood he was going through a tough time.\r  \n\r  \nLast night, he sat beside me on the couch, looking nervous. I tried to hold his hand, but he pulled away. He sighed and said he wanted a divorce. I was shocked. After another agonizing silence, I asked why. And he said he was gay. I stared at him, trying to process the information. I asked how long he had known, and he said since adolescence. He told me he was raised in a small religious town, where his father was a church pastor, and he always felt different. He only managed to discover his true self during adolescence. He said he felt a lot of fear, prayed, and fasted out of fear of going to hell. Shortly after, he met me, liked me, and hoped that God had \"cured\" him, so he asked me out. But he realized that no matter how fond he was of me, he didn't truly love me. However, he continued with me, hoping to learn to love me one day, along with the fear of coming out and disappointing his parents. Now that they're no longer here, he finally feels he can be free and be himself. He said he never cheated on me because he had deep respect for me and didn't want to hurt me. He had a vasectomy years ago, as he knew this moment would come, and having children would only make things worse. He desires an amicable divorce, leaving almost everything to me as he starts anew elsewhere. He also asked me not to tell anyone yet, as he doesn't feel ready.\r  \n\r  \nI was devastated, yelled at him, and told him to leave the house. He didn't yell back and agreed, saying he understood my anger. He packed his things and went to sleep at a friend's house. The wife of this friend and I are very close; she called asking why I had kicked him out. I was still angry, so I told her everything that had happened. She was shocked and offered support. Later, her husband called and said I was being an idiot for outing my husband like that and that I had no right to force him out of the closet. I simply hung up and broke down again. Now, I'm in bed, crying, while I ask strangers on Reddit for guidance on what to do.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

NTA OP, I\u2019m sad for your ex that he spent so much of his life living unauthentically but you are entitled to your feelings and it\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to magically be okay with this.", "It's worse than that. He knew this day would come and got a vasectomy to prevent complications in the divorce he knew he was going to ask for. He stole her entire life lying to her out of selfishness.", "Being gay isn\u2019t bad, but being outed can be *dangerous*. It\u2019s a safety concern.", "True, she can act however she wants, but that doesn't mean she's immune from the consequences. She can out her husband, but doesn't mean she won't/can't be criticized for that (by the husband or the friends).", "No, I didn't know about vasectomy. After marriage, he mentioned that he didn't want children, and I personally never felt such a strong desire to be a mother, so at the time I didn't mind, and we started using condoms and birth control.", "If he was using condoms with you, then I honestly doubt  he's been faithful to you and never cheated. I would advise you to get STD tested in any case. Better safe then sorry", "Um he\u2019s out of the closet now. He ruined her life. She has every right to tell people what\u2019s just happened to her. If he wanted to stay in the closet he should have stayed there.", "Are you American? You must be American.", "Exactly! He wasted 20 years of her life!!! 20 YEARS!!! I feel so mad rn", "I agree. It's very much op being close to innocent here, but she outed her husband and that's never ok.", "I mean if OP knew he had a vasectomy and she wanted kids, that part's on her for staying with him when she knew he didn't/couldn't. \n\nBut we don't have enough info for that either way.\n\nETA: Disregard.

He went public when he told his victim and asked for a divorce.\n\nHe wasn't \"trusting his secret\" to his wife or best friend, but confessing to the victim of his deceit. Excluding the delusions of a narcissist, there is no possibility that OP's ex expected this to go no further (he made no such request) \n\nIt is the reason for the divorce (so lawyers and courts are about to be told). \n \nStop shifting blame to the victim.", "Normally I agree but I'm torn on this.  This is her news and tragedy too. She's been lied to for twenty years, doesn't she deserve someone to vent to and commiserate with?  What is she supposed to say, she kicked him out for no reason? It's not like she went to his work or the wider friend group, she told her best friend what she was going through. \n\nWhat's the general consensus on this? Is she literally supposed to suffer in silence alone?", "Out of curiosity, how would you normally suggest a friend process their spouse asking for a divorce like this? OP should process this betrayal alone? Her whole marriage was a lie and her spouse always knew he would leave her\u2026. Nope. She gets to have someone to talk to. She gets to tell the truth.", "I think this is a well formed response, but I disagree that this is not her secret to tell. She now has to deal with the trauma of living a lie for years, of the the most basic intimate betrayal of trust and to tell her that she cannot talk to anyone about it is only compounding.", "Not her secret to tell? She hasn't blabbed all over town has she? She'd confided in 1 friend who reached out to help cos the husband is now holed up in their house. That friend then blabbed it to her husband. They were probably going to find out what's going on.\n\nAnd this guy wants to sit there crying about this after just telling his wife that their 20 year marriage was a lie and he never loved her? She has every right to be apocalyptically livid.", "This is a terrible take.", "He outed himself and forced his sexuality to be part of her life story. She can tell anyone she damn well pleases. He can go choke on a thousand dicks.", "It did become her secrets to tell once he decided to lie to her for 20y. She deserves help and this is the only way to get it.", "He stole her life. He can get to fuck. I wouldn't lie to protect a man who lied to me every day for 20 years. If he is allowed his truth she is also allowed hers. He made his sexuality her business when he married her under false pretences and then divorced her over his sexuality. She shouldn't have to lie about the reason someone just destroyed her life. That's his cross to bear not hers.", "He lead her on for their entire relationship, obviously using her as a beard for his parents. \n\nAt this point he deserves whatever he gets.", "[removed]", "He always knew he would leave her. You read that part right? She can never get those 20 years back to live her life with someone who loved her. She gets to tell her truth while he lives his.\n\nEdit: in response to the edit- there\u2019s nothing homophobic about recognizing what he did to her was horrible and she shouldn\u2019t have to suffer his betrayal alone. Being gay but not out isn\u2019t an excuse to hurt someone like this.", "Trying to do the right thing after he knowingly destroyed her entire adult life by lying to her the entire time? Yeah No, he is the major humongous asshole.", "Disagree. To keep that kind of secret for so long from someone that assumes you are both soulmates is a null-and-voider.\n\nHis feeling are important, but so are hers, and she should not have to suffer this pain alone. She should not be prohibited from confiding in a close friend for the necessary emotional support needed.\n\nTo demand otherwise is hypocritical.", ">He was trying to make it amicable,\n\nNo he wasn't. He lied to her for 20 years. That is utterly fucked up. He doesn't get to guilt her just because he's gay. He's an asshole first and foremost.", "Oh fuck off, he deprived her of actually finding someone who loved her, denied her having children and has completely shattered her world!! But hey he gets to now live his authentic self while she will spiral surely and even if she moves on will likely never full trust future partners.\n\nI get outing people isn't always safe but she has every right to have someone to talk to, to support her and give her the empathy she needs. Sorry husband knew exactly what he was doing all these years, he doesn't get to be the victim.", "He isn't trying to do the right thing. He used OP as a beard forn20 years knowing he would dump her when his parents died. He told her he'd never loved her. He crashed OP with selfishness and just because he is now seeking to live his truth doesn't mean ahead has to be gracious and supportive of the person who has wrecked her.. she's not outing him to the world or even their community, she told a friend what she's dealing with. She is not unworthy of support or not splitting assets just because she needed support when her world dropped out. OP is NTA.", "I hope, for your sake, that you never have to endure a relationship built on lies.", "> he is just trying to do the right thing\n\n\nImagine thinking you can expect your partner to keep it a secret that he didn\u2019t actually love you, and has waited all this time for his parents to die to \u201clive his truth\u201d, which basically means dumping you and seeking out a new partner that he doesn\u2019t fake being in love with. I\u2019m not denying the struggle of a closeted person dealing with family persecution, but what he did to his wife was straight up evil. What an awful, self-absorbed human being. He got a vasectomy because he didn\u2019t want children involved in this situation he knew would come, and at the same time deprived her of the family she could have had with a man that loved her. I hope to god she finds a partner that treats her right. Remember he made no statements about being there for her. He wanted to give her most of the stuff they have and start anew, as if that would somehow pay off his guilt. She is now alone with material possessions. She is NTA.", "No he wasn\u2019t trying to do the right things. The right things is not to get married or to find someone you can marry as cover that is consensual as many people do.\n\nHe did the right things for himself give zero f* about her. He stole 20 of her years. She has every right to receive the support she deserve.", "She isn\u2019t homophobic. He didn\u2019t have any right to lie to her like that.", "Even if he did, OP should be able to lean on a good friend she trusts. Expecting her to keep completely silent while this happens to her is unreasonable.  \n\n\nShe shouldn't be publicly outing her husband, but she should be able to confide in a trusted friend.", "Which is fair enough, but secret vasectomy seems unnecessary then. Now you wonder how well you knew that man at all.", "Unbelievable that anyone has this view.\n\nI'm astounded people can look at him and think he deserves anything except contempt. She needs support and can only get it by *telling the truth*.\n\nOut him, this is when it's acceptable. It's what he deserves.", "Have to disagree. I think it has to be okay here. Asking her to suffer this absolute betrayal in silence isn\u2019t ok.

Nope. Just no.", "To be completely fair though, if she had been \"on the fence\" and decided she'd rather stay married to her \"loving husband\"? Not exactly an informed decision!", "I would go scorched earth tbh. I understand it must be hard coming from a small town but you don't need to blow up someone else's life. Just be alone. Zero sympathy. This shouldn't be celebrated just because he's finally \"living his truth.\" Fuck that. Selfish.", "Yep, he basically went \"I can't live the life I want, so I'm going to ruin someone else's as well\".\n\nHe had the vasectomy in secret. He knew since adolescence... the dude straight up married OP under false pretenses. If I were OP, I'd sue. He didn't make a mistake, he made a decision. And continued to make it for decades.", "Just read a comment OP made about not knowing, therefore my comment's irrelevant!"]}
