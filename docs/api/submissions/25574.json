You're not his puppet to wait on him at his command.", "So -- combining information you've given in the post and in several comments -- it seems that he comes home at irregular and unpredictable intervals, which he learns about several *days* in advance... but tells *you* about only a few *hours* in advance.\n\nThat's pretty damn discourteous IMO. I've been in your husband's situation, with one crucial difference. About fifteen years ago, I had a temporary job in a city about 3 hours' drive away from our home. Too far to commute daily, so I rented a place to stay in the other city. I'd call my wife as I was leaving to come home, giving her \"only\" about 3 hours notice of my arrival -- but here's that crucial difference: my schedule was predictable. I came home *every* weekend, at about the same time. She already knew I was going to be getting home around 7pm on Friday; the phone call was to let her know exactly when.\n\nYour husband doesn't even let you know what *day* he's coming home until that very day, even though he knows much sooner, and IMO that's astonishingly rude and disrespectful.\n\nYou are NTA here; he is. But I have to wonder why you put up with this.", "INFO: how much notice does he get that he can come home?", "Not everybody *likes* surprises. \n\nIt would totally suck for your husband to come home one day and you had just left for the day, (as one does, sometimes), because you thought you had some free time. Surprise! Have fun twiddling your thumbs at home alone, honey! \n\nWhat, does he pop in with no notice because he is expecting to catch you fucking the mailman or something? NTA", "I've surprised my wife by coming home early (not easy to do when we're both on google location) a few times. Wouldn't expect her to drop plans she's made though.\n\nLet him know you need him to give you a heads up if its that big of a deal for you. You really shouldn't be arguing that much if you're newly married too so put in some work around communicating with eachother", "NTA.\n\nNo, his time is *not* \"more valuable\" than your time. His time is *equally* valuable. Time is valuable to everyone - nobody has enough free time  If he wants you to spend his off time with him, he needs to let you know when he's going to be home so that you can clear your schedule.", "NTA- but I find your relationship dynamic a little confusing. When he works out of town don\u2019t you keep in touch constantly via text or phoning each other? Even saying good night etc? Surely these would be opportunities for him to tell you he\u2019s coming home? \n\nAlso it\u2019s very controlling of him to come home unannounced and expect you to drop everything for him. And the fact that he believes his time is more precious than yours is just demeaning to you.\n\nAlso what are you arguing about all the time? It\u2019s a bit concerning that you\u2019re apart for a long time and then when you are together you argue non stop. Just doesn\u2019t seem healthy. Maybe you need to reconnect a bit more with each other", "NTA.  If he expects you to drop everything, the very least he can do is give you the heads up via phone or text to let you know he\u2019s coming and give you time to adjust plans if you can.

His time is not more valuable than yours. You\u2019re NTA. But stop canceling your plans. He needs to tell you his work schedule when he learns it. Not show up unannounced and expect you to be available. That\u2019s absurd.", " NTA. Your hubby needs to be more considerate to your needs.\nPersonally,  I like to be informed so I don't get a fright when someone walks in unexpectedly. For example, my partner came home early one day, and I'm in the shower. So I'm washing my hair and I can't see a thing. He decided to jump into the shower with me. Here I am, eyes closed, oblivious that there's someone in the house, and he touches me. Too say that he scared the shit out of me is an understatement! He didn't get why I got scared. Most women my age have been traumatised by the movie Psycho's shower scene. \n\nSo, in a nut shell, he now gives me a heads up for my peace of mind.", "Definitely a control/manipulation tactic. His time is \u201cmore valuable\u201d?? Aw heck no", "ESH. Of course your husband is allowed to come home with no notice; he lives there too. Of course you don't have to drop all your plans with no notice because he is suddenly in town. But is there a reason you two are even married? Do you WANT to spend any time with him?", "INFO: why can\u2019t he just call you to say he\u2019s coming home?", "In my honest opinion, NTA. If he\u2019s away and working, he should give you the common courtesy of knowing when he plans on arriving. It\u2019s not fair to you and what plans you had prior to him just popping up. Which I\u2019m not saying is bad, but in the same sense, he needs to know you have a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around him and his schedule.", "NTA - how hard is it to give you a heads-up that he's coming home early and he wants to do something with you? The assumption that you'll just cancel your plans for him... just ew, that's so dismissive and insulting and \"superior\" of him.", "NTA but y\u2019all need marriage counseling. You should not be fighting this much and it\u2019s clear you and him have communication issues.", "The big issues here are that 1) your husband values his idea of surprising you over listening to what you\u2019ve expressed about hating surprises, 2) your husband expecting you to cancel all your plans for him, and 3) you feeling that you have to into order to avoid a fight and prove that he matters more to you than anyone else. \n\nAdvance notice for coming home\u2014this is a little more about personal preferences. Some people would love the surprise; others would hate it. It\u2019s not a bad or unreasonable thing to be annoyed by but it\u2019s also understandable that he\u2019d be hurt that you\u2019re not excited to see him. \n\nUltimately I won\u2019t give a judgment bc what\u2019s clear is that you two should not have gotten married and should stop being married. At that point the question of who\u2019s the AH is kinda moot.", "Can you show up where he works and demand that he drops everything since you were nice enough to surprise him?\n\nNTA", "The only successful relationships have good communication.

Because after more than one conversation about he knows \u201csurprising\u201d you and expecting you to drop everything is just going to start an argument. So is the argument his end goal at this point? \n\nI \u201csurprised\u201d my ex when I came home a week earlier than planned. (I drove OTR at the time) It did not go over well. (I didn\u2019t ask him to cancel anything. He had to cancel on his fwb tho-I knew we had an \u201copen\u201d relationship\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02) Never surprised him again.

It seems like you have a huge communication problem.

You're explaining to him in advance how you are going to handle plans that you make to avoid additional frustration and resentment. \n\nThen you HAVE to keep your plans 100% of the time.

I would change plans too if he were away so often.", "This seems like more of a communication issue.

You could have just as easily kept your plans. I get being frustrated though.", "NTA", "Why on earth are you even considering cancelling? Go to the concert", "NTA. He knew you had these plans and he still expected you to drop them because he happened to get those days off. Does he always seem to magically get days off when he knows you have plans?

He just thinks they should spend as much time together because they don\u2019t get to spend time together. Honestly, it would be way smarter to plan around the first couple of days because there is less of a chance of him coming home because he is gone for weeks at a time. Should he tell her that he is coming yes. Should he expect her to cancel her plans no. But I understand what his thought process is. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s the fact that he believes time spent together is more valuable than going out with her friends because of how little time they do spend together, not to mention the constant arguments OP said they have.", "Thank you!!!!", "It definitely does.

If you do this, I can try to adapt my own schedule to spend time with you without disrupting my life, and I will feel much more comfortable when you\u2019re back home. All you need to do is send me a text of the day you want to come back and an estimated time. I\u2019d very much appreciate this.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy final problem is that when you do visit, you often expect me to adapt my entire schedule for you. This isn\u2019t feasible - as I\u2019ve said, my life continues while you\u2019re not at home, and I am uncomfortable with cancelling all my plans on a whim. I do understand that you want to spend time with me and I want to spend time with you too - but it makes me feel like you don\u2019t respect any of *my* plans or what I do with *my* time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do the best I can to ensure I can enjoy time with you while you\u2019re home, but it would be much easier to do this if I was told in advance. So I need to set a boundary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you come home without telling me ~2+ days in advance from now on, I will be sticking to my usual routine because I won\u2019t have had time to adapt my plans. This probably means we won\u2019t be able to spend much time together but I need to respect myself, and the people around me who I have made plans with.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeparately, if I have important plans I\u2019ve made in advance (eg. concert) when you come to visit, I am still going to stick to them and attend these events. I\u2019m not putting my life on pause whenever you\u2019re home - I work too, and your time isn\u2019t more important than mine. It upset me a lot when you expected me to drop that concert (that I told you about months ago) just because you were visiting, and that has ruined your visit for me. I don\u2019t want to be in that situation again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to talk about, please let me know. I want to work this out *with* you. But this situation is causing a rift between us, and I want that to change.\u201d\n\n:)\n\nObviously edit this at will\u2026 not sure why I spent 15 minutes on this reply but hope it\u2019s helpful to you. This is the kind of stuff you ought to say to approach the topic. \u2764\ufe0f", "It feels like he's trying to catch her doing something.
