You're not his puppet to wait on him at his command.", "So -- combining information you've given in the post and in several comments -- it seems that he comes home at irregular and unpredictable intervals, which he learns about several *days* in advance... but tells *you* about only a few *hours* in advance.\n\nThat's pretty damn discourteous IMO. I've been in your husband's situation, with one crucial difference. About fifteen years ago, I had a temporary job in a city about 3 hours' drive away from our home. Too far to commute daily, so I rented a place to stay in the other city. I'd call my wife as I was leaving to come home, giving her \"only\" about 3 hours notice of my arrival -- but here's that crucial difference: my schedule was predictable. I came home *every* weekend, at about the same time. She already knew I was going to be getting home around 7pm on Friday; the phone call was to let her know exactly when.\n\nYour husband doesn't even let you know what *day* he's coming home until that very day, even though he knows much sooner, and IMO that's astonishingly rude and disrespectful.\n\nYou are NTA here; he is. But I have to wonder why you put up with this.", "INFO: how much notice does he get that he can come home?", "Not everybody *likes* surprises. \n\nIt would totally suck for your husband to come home one day and you had just left for the day, (as one does, sometimes), because you thought you had some free time. Surprise! Have fun twiddling your thumbs at home alone, honey! \n\nWhat, does he pop in with no notice because he is expecting to catch you fucking the mailman or something? NTA", "I've surprised my wife by coming home early (not easy to do when we're both on google location) a few times. Wouldn't expect her to drop plans she's made though.\n\nLet him know you need him to give you a heads up if its that big of a deal for you. You really shouldn't be arguing that much if you're newly married too so put in some work around communicating with eachother", "NTA.\n\nNo, his time is *not* \"more valuable\" than your time. His time is *equally* valuable. Time is valuable to everyone - nobody has enough free time  If he wants you to spend his off time with him, he needs to let you know when he's going to be home so that you can clear your schedule.", "NTA- but I find your relationship dynamic a little confusing. When he works out of town don\u2019t you keep in touch constantly via text or phoning each other? Even saying good night etc? Surely these would be opportunities for him to tell you he\u2019s coming home? \n\nAlso it\u2019s very controlling of him to come home unannounced and expect you to drop everything for him. And the fact that he believes his time is more precious than yours is just demeaning to you.\n\nAlso what are you arguing about all the time? It\u2019s a bit concerning that you\u2019re apart for a long time and then when you are together you argue non stop. Just doesn\u2019t seem healthy. Maybe you need to reconnect a bit more with each other", "NTA.  If he expects you to drop everything, the very least he can do is give you the heads up via phone or text to let you know he\u2019s coming and give you time to adjust plans if you can.

His time is not more valuable than yours. You\u2019re NTA. But stop canceling your plans. He needs to tell you his work schedule when he learns it. Not show up unannounced and expect you to be available. That\u2019s absurd.", " NTA. Your hubby needs to be more considerate to your needs.\nPersonally,  I like to be informed so I don't get a fright when someone walks in unexpectedly. For example, my partner came home early one day, and I'm in the shower. So I'm washing my hair and I can't see a thing. He decided to jump into the shower with me. Here I am, eyes closed, oblivious that there's someone in the house, and he touches me. Too say that he scared the shit out of me is an understatement! He didn't get why I got scared. Most women my age have been traumatised by the movie Psycho's shower scene. \n\nSo, in a nut shell, he now gives me a heads up for my peace of mind.", "Definitely a control/manipulation tactic. His time is \u201cmore valuable\u201d?? Aw heck no", "ESH. Of course your husband is allowed to come home with no notice; he lives there too. Of course you don't have to drop all your plans with no notice because he is suddenly in town. But is there a reason you two are even married? Do you WANT to spend any time with him?", "INFO: why can\u2019t he just call you to say he\u2019s coming home?", "In my honest opinion, NTA. If he\u2019s away and working, he should give you the common courtesy of knowing when he plans on arriving. It\u2019s not fair to you and what plans you had prior to him just popping up. Which I\u2019m not saying is bad, but in the same sense, he needs to know you have a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around him and his schedule.", "NTA - how hard is it to give you a heads-up that he's coming home early and he wants to do something with you? The assumption that you'll just cancel your plans for him... just ew, that's so dismissive and insulting and \"superior\" of him.", "NTA but y\u2019all need marriage counseling. You should not be fighting this much and it\u2019s clear you and him have communication issues.", "The big issues here are that 1) your husband values his idea of surprising you over listening to what you\u2019ve expressed about hating surprises, 2) your husband expecting you to cancel all your plans for him, and 3) you feeling that you have to into order to avoid a fight and prove that he matters more to you than anyone else. \n\nAdvance notice for coming home\u2014this is a little more about personal preferences. Some people would love the surprise; others would hate it. It\u2019s not a bad or unreasonable thing to be annoyed by but it\u2019s also understandable that he\u2019d be hurt that you\u2019re not excited to see him. \n\nUltimately I won\u2019t give a judgment bc what\u2019s clear is that you two should not have gotten married and should stop being married. At that point the question of who\u2019s the AH is kinda moot.", "Can you show up where he works and demand that he drops everything since you were nice enough to surprise him?\n\nNTA", "The only successful relationships have good communication.

Because after more than one conversation about he knows \u201csurprising\u201d you and expecting you to drop everything is just going to start an argument. So is the argument his end goal at this point? \n\nI \u201csurprised\u201d my ex when I came home a week earlier than planned. (I drove OTR at the time) It did not go over well. (I didn\u2019t ask him to cancel anything. He had to cancel on his fwb tho-I knew we had an \u201copen\u201d relationship\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02) Never surprised him again.

It seems like you have a huge communication problem.

You're explaining to him in advance how you are going to handle plans that you make to avoid additional frustration and resentment. \n\nThe you HAVE to keep your plans 100% of the time.

You could have just as easily kept your plans. I get being frustrated though.", "NTA", "Why on earth are you even considering cancelling? Go to the concert", "NTA. He knew you had these plans and he still expected you to drop them because he happened to get those days off. Does he always seem to magically get days off when he knows you have plans?

He just thinks they should spend as much time together because they don\u2019t get to spend time together. Honestly, it would be way smarter to plan around the first couple of days because there is less of a chance of him coming home because he is gone for weeks at a time. Should he tell her that he is coming yes. Should he expect her to cancel her plans no. But I understand what his thought process is. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s the fact that he believes time spent together is more valuable than going out with her friends because of how little time they do spend together, not to mention the constant arguments OP said they have.", "Thank you!!!!", "It definitely does.

It\u2019s strange to me, but even doctors can\u2019t do phone appointments without confirming we are in the same state. \n\nMy husband and I had an excellent marriage therapist several years back on the east coast. We really liked her and she helped our marriage immensely. After moving west and having some other life challenges come up, we decided it might help to have a couple therapy sessions as a tune up or reminder of what we had learned. She tried to get approval from our state to virtually counsel us here, but it wasn\u2019t approved- which was frustrating because she knew us and our history and also there are a shortage of therapists here.  Hopefully wherever the OP is, virtual therapy is allowed!", "Ok, that did'nt really answer the question though (was meant more in a general sense)\n\nAnyway, did you make your plans known to him beforehand. Just in a normal, conversation type ( i belive you mentioned somewhere else you facetime regularly) or was He actually unaware?", "So then why don\u2019t you try being explicit?! A therapist would tell you to sit down with him when your both calm and make \u201cI\u201d statements. For example:\n\n\u201cI get frustrated when you show up without warning. I don\u2019t like surprises. I plan my weeks out in advance so I can be organized and prepared for me and the kids. When you show up and expect me to change or cancel plans with no warning, I feel disrespected. I don\u2019t like arguing with you, but I don\u2019t like being treated this way. I hate these \u201csurprises\u201d and you typically know for a few days when you\u2019ll be home. If you want us to be free to spend time with you, I need you to tell me before you come.\u201d\n\nThen give him a chance to process and reply. Encourage him to use \u201cI\u201d statements ti share his feelings and perspective too.\n\nIf he keeps thinking surprises are fun, ask him why pleasure he is getting out of doing something ti you that he knows you don\u2019t like?  And also, if he keeps doing this, just keep with your plans. He can join in or not, but you asked him to notify you and if he doesn\u2019t, the natural consequence is that you all have other things going on.", "Then just hug him tight and tell him you love him so much and are so happy he\u2019s home. Give him some warmth and love. While you\u2019re cuddling with him let him know how you feel directly. Tell him that you don\u2019t like surprises and need to know exactly when he knows when he\u2019s coming home. \n\nTell him you don\u2019t want to be the flaky friend who\u2019s always canceling last minute, and that you plan things in advance and are really looking forward to doing them. When he suddenly is home you want to spend time with him, but that the feeling is conflicted because you also had other plans you were looking forward to. Do this in a calm setting and ask him why he feels like he needs to surprise you.", "Not if he values his testicles! \ud83e\udd23", ">How hard is it to text \"hey I'm heading home soon\" or \"hey I'm on my way home\"?\n\nIt's not a big deal. The big deal is he expects her to drop everything. For that, OP is rightfully angry. \n\nHow hard is it for her to ask when he's coming home next?", "Then you should have just gone. It was your choice not to go", "So here\u2019s what is going on. Her husband is a truck driver and is gone until they literally tell him he can go home. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s supposed to be gone 5 days a week and is coming home continuously a day or two early. He\u2019s getting a few days off with a last minute notice and wants to spend his days off with her. He may only get 2-3 days off and he wants to spend them with her. Because of this I have suggested she plan outings with the girls for the first few days he is gone.", "Then in all honesty\u2026you need to meet him more on his side. I get it. I get that it\u2019s frustrating but you\u2019re wrong. He can\u2019t plan ahead and communicate better and when he comes home he wants to be with you. Maybe you need to plan to do things with your friends the first few days of him being gone instead of near the end of it. This isn\u2019t him surprising you. This is him literally finding out he\u2019s off and heading home. YTA. Even though you\u2019re not really an a hole. This is just more of you needing to learn to accept the limitations and reality of his job.", "Hypothetical situation:\n\nHusband just did his delivery and was told he can go take a few days home. He hasn't been home in a month. He texts you he'll be home in 2 days for the weekend. These are the only 2 days he gets off before he hits the road again. \n\nYou had made plans to go to the beach with your girlfriends that weekend weeks ago. \n\nWhat you doing?", "That thought process led HIM to say that his time is more valuable than hers. If that's what he thinks, he needs to wake up. Not that \"time together\" is more valuable, but \"his time\", according to the actual post. Maybe that's the source of those arguments. \n\nIf he called and said \"I'm coming home in a couple days, do you have any plans?\" I'm guessing she would be happier to rearrange a few things and cancel others in order to spend more time together. But he doesn't. He just shows up and expects her to dump everything and then says THAT.", "Could be time for some tough love. You have told him you don't like being surprised. You said he knows at least three days ahead of time and refuses to give you a heads up most of the time. If I was in your shoes and my husband did that to me, I'd be like, well glad your home, I have plans, I'll see you later. I absolutely would NOT be cancelling my plans.", "To be honest, it isn\u2019t even worth fighting about. You\u2019re doing nothing wrong. Sit him down and set your boundary. If he breaks it, don\u2019t cancel a thing. You can be lovely and warm and kind in between your plans, but it\u2019s really unfair for you to be constantly on call.", "Least he could do is send a txt to give you a heads up", "The dude is almost 40. I\u2019m not hopeful if he hasn\u2019t understood this concept of respect for someone else\u2019s time yet.", "Exactly!  A few in my family are also the \"I was in the neighborhood\" type of people and I cannot explain the stress this causes, and a text when you are in my driveway is NOT notice. \n\nI don't know what kind of people sit around their perfectly clean house, fully dressed all day with a plate of freshly baked cookies on the counter just in case company comes by, but I am not one of those people. Mentally preparing is one (crucial) thing for me, but seriously, I could be naked, I could be drunk, my partner and I could be participating in particularly exuberant nooner, hell, I could be alone having a screaming ugly cry about something that happened 14 years ago, you don't know!\n\nFucking call first or do not expect me to open the door.", "It was explained to me that it was so that you\u2019re not receiving medical treatment from a provider that can\u2019t get to you or contact the right people in case of emergency, or something like that. But it feels so silly when an hour\u2019s drive can take me into a different state and out into a third state, yet someone in, say, Southern California can do therapy for someone in Northern California a good 8+ hours drive away.", "I have actually had these plans for a while, which before I made them asked if he could take the time off to join me. He said he couldn\u2019t, so I went about my business. I\u2019ve been pretty exited about this, so I bought an outfit, which I showed him. I\u2019ve been talking about this since August 1st. Idk how he could have forgotten when it\u2019s all I talk about. (Not really but you get the point)", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 on this day\u2026(insert husbands name here) died bc he came home and scared me in the shower.", "How hard is it for him to tell her?", "Which would have resulted in a fight bc I didn\u2019t make time for him, and I chose my \u201cfriends\u201d over him", "No, that's...not what's going on. She already said that he knows his schedule about 3 days in advance generally, and he never informs her, instead giving barely any notice of a few hours to \"surprise\" her. If this was an occasional thing where he got an unexpected day off, I'd agree with you (aside from the fact that he *expects* her to cancel any plans and would start a fight otherwise). But this is a pattern of never giving notice ahead of time, even when he can.", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d never saw it this way. Thanks for the input!!", "I call my girlfriends up and postpone, or ask if he wants to be a part of the plans. With enough notice I can adjust and make arrangements. Kinda hard to do with a few hours.", "Thank you I honestly appreciate it! I was second guessing myself for a moment. I didn\u2019t feel like I was doing anything wrong, but when he complained about me not making time for him, I snapped. I need to learn to calm down and explain my feelings instead of reacting first.", "Why didn\u2019t you go?\n\nI would have still gone.\n\nThis guy sounds awful - like he enjoys ruining your fun *and* at the same time, making it so if you\u2019re upset about it you\u2019re the bad guy.", "I\u2019m sorry, but I seem to be missing something. You had plans that you scheduled, months in advance; why would you cancel due to his schedule? \n\nThis is not a relationship based on love and respect. He should want you to be happy and if spending time together is so important, he needs to take time off. You\u2019re not his bang-maid and you\u2019re entitled to a life and friends.", "He didn\u2019t forget about it. I promise he knew what he was doing.  Stop canceling your plans. He has days to tell you his schedule showing up with just a few hours notice is controlling.", "Your in a fight now anyway because you are pissed you canceled. At least you had what ever you had planned if you just went.", "Like I said above, you probably shouldn\u2019t be married if you and your husband can\u2019t discuss these issues in a civil way", "I asked her why she didn\u2019t ask each day what his schedule was for the next day and she said he didn\u2019t get that much notice.", "Sorry. There are very few times I hate typing that y the a. This was one of them. Because I don\u2019t think you are. I think it\u2019s about learning how to work together with the situation at hand. Over time it will get easier. I promise. My husband gets up at 4 am (sometimes earlier). Because of that we try to get the house \u201cshut down\u201d around 8. I hate going to bed at 8:30 lol. I\u2019m a late night sleep in person. It\u2019s just the reality of his job.", "True!!!"]}
