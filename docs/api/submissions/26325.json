Like, when I was a kid and was sick, my dad would pick me up and take me to the office with him, because someone has to take care of the kid.\n\nHe earned the PTO by working extensive overtime, which means his wife picked up the parenting slack this whole time. He also chose to dedicate the PTO to studying, it wasn't required, and he said he finished 2 weeks in one day. So what is he so busy with?\n\nAnd what about his wife's career, her time, her education, all of which he doesn't mention. We know she works, so she is not a SAHM. When he's working all this overtime, she's taking the full brunt of both working and being a parent. Of course she wants him to help her.", "The test can Also be a mandatory part of his work, its common as nurses/doctors etc. Yes kids are a priority, doesnt have to be a priority 24/7 if you have a partner. \n\nIf i can give my partner 4 hours of time to forage mushrooms in the Wood, his wife could give him time to study for a work thing.", "The wife is also working based on the text.\n\nSo why is only one of them parenting?", "Um so day 2 he was a stay at home dad then, right?\nA stay at home mom does not work at a job in the house or out of the house. OP's wife has a job out of the house. She is not a SAHM, she is a working mom who happened to be home that day, and he is a working dad who happened to be home that day.", "it's not clear, just that she was home. she may have been WFH because they didn't have a daycare, or this could be post work.\n\nwhich... he was also home and not available to care for the kids, so why is the assumption that she's home and also available?", "Who is watching the kids the rest of the time, and is his wife also working full time?\n\nWithout the answer to these questions, it's unclear. It's important to get an education, but if doing that means sticking your also full time working  wife with the kids, yeah, you're an AH. If she works part time and this is her off day, then he's not.\n\nHe also mentioned he finished two weeks of studying in one day, so... what is he so busy for?\n\nHe also earned that PTO by working overtime, which meant his wife had to pick up all the childcare slack. Kids need more care than some time every few hours. His wife ALSO works. He's an AH bc he's stuck her with being the main parent, despite the fact that she is also working. His work is not special and sacred over hers.", "Thats not relevant to the conflict. I don\u2019t care how important it is. *you communicate to your SO like a fucking grown up*. And stop replying to my same comment multiple times. Thats fucking annoying just do an edit if you think of more to say", "If she was, someone needs to be watching the kids. I'm asking OP for info on this, because if they're both WFH, it's not fair (and deeply sexist) to assume she should be the one doing childcare. They should hire someone\n\nBut tbh this to me reads like a dad who has put a lot of the parenting burden on his wife under the guise of work and a wife whose sick of it. he already shifts a lot of the time to just her with his overtime and extra shifts, and now he gets bonus PTO for working overtime that he uses to study so she can continue to raise the kids on her own.", "Again, he says he's being compensated in PTO, not money, and he obviously isn't using it for his family or according to any agreement he made with his wife when his entire post is about the fact that he's hiding and lying when he uses it.", "OH THANK GOD. I COULDN'T FIND ACRONYMS ANYWHERE. \n\nWhat does ESH mean?", "Not enough information to really get the whole picture.", "He\u2019s studying for his job, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s doing it specifically so he doesn\u2019t have to parent. But if she\u2019s frustrated, that\u2019s fair, they need to have a conversation. She doesn\u2019t get to treat him working from home like he\u2019s on PTO (which she has) or not respect that he\u2019s studying not just lounging around.", "Many companies allow PTO to be cashed out at the end of the year, not saying OPs company does, but it's certainly possible.", "yeah, that's my point. he needs to give more info about his wife and her hours, but based on what he's written, she also works. if she's working full time and he's working full time, he is 100% being an AH. if she's off work, and works part time, then she's being an AH.", "It's just that someone has to take care of the kids all the time. \"I'm working\" isn't actually an out unless the other person ISN'T. like if you're both at work and the kid is sick, then someone has to go take care of the kid. If they're both WFH and the kid is bouncing off the walls, yeah, it's reasonable to ask the person who is studying to care for them. He's stuck her alone with the kids with all the overtime, and then sticks her alone with the kids with the paid PTO he got with all the overtime, and then says she nags him too much to spend time with his kids.\n\nI'd bet money she does well over her fair share of childcare. \n\nHe also finished 2 weeks of studying in one day, so can he really not take an afternoon off to take the kid out? Like, really? If he budgeted 2 weeks and finished almost all of it in one day...then what's the extra time going to?"]}
