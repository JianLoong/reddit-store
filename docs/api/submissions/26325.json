If they're both WFH and the kid is bouncing off the walls, yeah, it's reasonable to ask the person who is studying to care for them.

They seem to have terrible communication and with kids it\u2019s even more difficult and frustrating.", "Because rabid double standards dilute the quality of advice found in the community?", "A spouse who cares does not lie. There has to be more to this story. Can\u2019t throw the mom under the bus because he is the one that lied. It seems like he needs to communicate and they both need to set boundaries and expectations. My husband managed to get an MBA while having two kids. He took the time to talk about time needed and expectations. I talked about my needs and expectations too and I know it\u2019s crazy but when people come to the table honestly and willing to compromise both can get needs met.", "Oh yeah, he's \"getting\" full days at home to study and do coursework - what a fun vacation he *gets* to have. Piss off dude", "The wife asked him to play with the kid not help with other things. Why can\u2019t the kid play by themselves", "That\u2019s quite a juggling act, congratulations on finishing your degree!", "It sounds like OP is just using his normal working hours to do his studying. As in he's studying when he'd normally be at the office working. It's a working vacation. Now his wife wants him to interrupt those hours, which he intentionally booked off work for a specific purpose, and when he'd normally not be in the home anyway, to do bonus shit.\n\nI'm sure OP spends plenty of time with his son after study/work hours but the demand to interrupt his study when he wouldn't normally even be home in the first place is ridiculous and inconsiderate of OPs plans.", "just another redditor making assumptions about someone's life based on their own.

He isn't taking anything from his family.", "Imma level with you, and really everyone who says \"when he wants a break from studying...\" nobody who is studying wants that fucking break from it. We *want* to continue in the zone but when you're staring at a brick wall of information after a few hours you're going to *need* a break - and he's using it to not actually have a break but to help the family. So it's not even a break, it's a pause on studying.", "Taking 10 minute breaks to spend time with kids is not parenting...", "Thank you! Like I said - it was a team effort however we are all enjoying the free time we now have available as a family", "This! I'm amazed at how many people missed this", "This. Though a mum, one that works almost ft and studies ft. If I\u2019m hone to study it is \u201cIm home to study.\u201d I did not take time off to spend it playing with my children. I took it off to work on my assessments for the education that is impacting our finances to improve them in the future. Dedicating normal working hours to study is acceptable. It does not make them a bad parent. It does not mean they are neglecting their child a who yes is a priority but play might not be. If the kid is sick sure, I will use that time to care for them. They are the priority. But play can wait until later. Especially if there is a parent home who isnt committed to education to play with them. In this case Id take my gear to the library and study there.", "He finished most of the studying already and then said no he can\u2019t spend time with his son. Come on now.

Then why is studying different? Study hours are study hours, not \u201cyou\u2019re home doing nothing so go outside with the kids\u201d hours. When he is done studying he can go out, just like he can go out when he is done working. As long as OP is still pulling his weight outside of study hours, he should be treated like he is working from home.", "Yeah this is the answer. I've had to take time off of all other responsibilities to specifically do nothing but study to for certifications/etc, and my partner would pick up the slack for that period. The result of it was positive financially and career-wise. However.....we talked about it and made arrangements beforehand. You can't reasonably blindside your partner with extra responsibilities because **you** feel it is justified. Find a solution that doesn't involve lying to your wife. Have you considered studying at a friend's house or reserving a room at your school?", "Finally a reasonable and well thought out comment. This is about boundaries and communication.

His work time just got reallocated.", "I think the unfair assumption is the wife is ALWAYS picking up the childcare responsibilities. It sounds like OP generally pulls his weight. Sometimes our spouses require more from us during certain times, I think studying for a test that could earn him a better job is good justification. \n\nMy husband travels for work, and when he does, I have to pick up the slack. It\u2019s just the way it is, but it\u2019s payed forward eventually- like right now I\u2019m pregnant and sick a lot of the time and my husband is doing so much around the house. \n\nIn real life it\u2019s impossible for things to always be 50/50. If OP is generally pulling his weight, and also considering he didn\u2019t take the week off to golf, I think I\u2019d like this one slide. Just me.", ">He earned the PTO by working extensive overtime, which means his wife picked up the parenting slack this whole time. \n\nI'm glad you mentioned this, I feel like people are glossing over it.

Dear God. This isn't some broad-based study about how the family as whole plans to to portion out their collective parenting time over the course of their marriage. It is a question about how she is *in this moment* sabotaging his time-sensitive study time that he's using to achieve a specific educational goal right now.\n\nIf he were sabotaging her final week leading up to her taking the bar exam, would you be posting this same post?", "She must not work full time if on one of those days she\u2019s home with the kids.

Whether they discussed a plan for vacation is irrelevant to this question, though it's an important topic that they should discuss themselves. My spouse and I end up using all of our PTO on the 31 workdays that the public schools decide not to work, plus the 2 week gap between the summer program and the fall start. If OP has.so.much PTO that they are hitting use/lose, it's reasonable to assume that the family isn't suffering by their taking a week to catch up on schooling.\n\nIn other words, he didn't take off to hang out with the kid. They should be wherever they normally are on a weekday.", "I saw that. But I know that my small house with children is not a place conducive to being undisturbed. He lied about why he was home and then got mad that he was asked to help out. Dumb and short sighted. Goto the office for a week if you\u2019re gonna lie about it, leave the house. Or better yet, just be honest from the get go. \u201cHey honey, I\u2019m taking some time to finish my course work this week, I\u2019ll be at a coffee shop, library, or WeWork if there\u2019s an emergency\u201d", "Why can\u2019t she do what she does when he\u2019s working?

Which means he\u2019s probably not studying as much as he\u2019s like us to think he is. He literally said he\u2019s almost done with his 2 weeks of studying. Bet he didn\u2019t study all day in day 2 since he\u2019s so far ahead of the game and she got pissed cause he wouldn\u2019t help out. He tells her he\u2019s using this time for studying. She doesn\u2019t buy it and reminds him that he better pass the test!!! Cause again, he probably wasn\u2019t studying. \n\nAnd also. If he was really only using the PTO for studying and he knew she would ask him to help out if he was home, then go to a library or something and study all day! Win/win.", "Except that he took it to study, presumably so that he could study during work hours instead of nights and weekends (I.e. \"family time\").", "He actually said that he \"gets extra PTO as ONE of his compensations\". So he is still getting paid normal money too for the extra shifts.", "You\u2019re acting like his time is more valuable than hers. Which it\u2019s not. Period.", "It might be for them but when he\u2019s missing spending time with his wife and children as much as he seemingly does he shouldn\u2019t be surprised when down the line his kids don\u2019t have a great relationship with him or his wife gets tired of being a sole parent and being neglected by her husband.", "Okay, what about when the parent is intentionally working overtime in order to not have to participate at home, both with chores and with childcare? When the other spouse isn't necessarily onboard with the overtime? It sounds like the reward is extra PTO, not additional money.", "This is Reddit. Must bash.", "Seriously! A lot of these wives act like they hate their husbands. Give the man a damn break. Coming from a wife! Haha", "Yes!! Everyone wants to speculate over each and every contribution OP/his wife make to the relationship when that\u2019s impossible for anyone to know. The only thing we know is he took time off to study for an exam, when he would otherwise be working, and everyone is acting like he\u2019s on a gd bender with his buddies. \n\nIf the wife is frustrated as a long result of him working too much, they need to communicate about that and figure out a way to resolve their childcare issues.

He didn't complete any of his studying on the first day.", "When our household got Covid, my husband had the audacity to say 'you got a mild case' because I continued to care for our child while he holed up in a separate room for a week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did not get a mild case, but I had to put the child's wellbeing above my own.

When I\u2019m sick enough to call off work I\u2019m resting to get better. I\u2019ll make sure the kids are fed, probably Dino nuggets, and no one needs medical attention, but beyond that I\u2019m not using my sick time to stress myself more than I would at work with home responsibilities.

I regularly had to use my PTO to study for exams.", "No and I accordingly said that it is a work in progress. And we don\u2019t really know that the husband is not a good parent. He said he took breaks to spend time with his kids. And if he knows that his wife\u2019s demands will impede his progress of studying, well, there is the confusion. Lots of information is needed for an accurate and equitable conclusion.", "But who was having to step up whilst he did all those additional hours to accrue the PTO?  His wife.    She\u2019s had to pick up the slack for the hours he worked when normally he would have been home.\n\nThat PTO is basically just giving him those hours back later, and he should be sharing the benefit of that with his family.  Which he is not.  And yes he could be getting the benefit of better future pay by studying, but by his own admission he\u2019d already done most of what he planned to do in terms of studying on day 1.  So he has plenty of capacity to help out and give his wife a break (to make up for the extra kid duties she was pulling whilst he was accruing all that PTO)", "Yes, I am.  But once you lie to someone, you lose the right to come back and say \u201cbut they would have done this anyway.\u201d\n\nShe made that comment because he lied.

The whole point of his PTO is to study, which he can't do at work, and he even spent some time with the kids that is extra! He would not usually have it! Because he's normally at work! It's not unreasonable for one member of a couple to do more with the kids short term when the other has something unusual happening at work. This tit for tat idea you have going is not a healthy relationship basis.\n\n If it was the wife posting about her husband trying to make her do childcare on the PTO she took specifically to get her studying done you would be absolutely incensed.", "I guess every kid is different, but I had working parents too. Often the adult who was watching me was either my elderly babysitter who couldn\u2019t do much physical playing with me (which was fine because I usually preferred solo activities like drawing or playing make believe with my Barbies anyway), or my aunt who worked nights and therefore was always asleep during daytime hours. \n\nI absolutely did not need hands-on care the way you seem to be implying once I reached preschool age."]}
