Over Christmas Break we started hanging out a lot and she was telling me all about her JROTC program at her school. I used to be in JROTC and was also in the Army so I figured if anything we could bond over it because me and her aren't exactly close. Well she comes into the room I was staying in at her house and starts telling me all about the cadences they use while marching and then she tells me her school has a special one that her Master Chief made it up and everyone at the school, even non-JROTC kids love it. She then proceeds to sing, word for word, I Want it That Way by The Backstreet Boys, just in cadence form. I let her finish and even applauded her, but said \"No wonder everyone likes it, that song is a classic.\" She got pouty and told me that no one knows it cause her school came up with it. I was confused so I looked up the song on Spotify and played it for her. She then left and I didn't think anything of it. Well she told her mom who came to me and told me I really upset her by telling her that the Backstreet Boys exist. Apparently her mom and dad knew about this but didn't want to hurt her feelings or \"burst her bubble\". I just thought it was weird she didn't know the Backstreet Boys, I get she is 14 but they aren't that old.
