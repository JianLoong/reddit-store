We both want kids, but she has fertility issues, so we\u2019ve been doing IVF for the past two years with no luck. The last time, my wife convinced herself she was going to get pregnant, so when it didn\u2019t work, she was crushed. I was sad, too, but I told her we\u2019d get through this and try again.\n\nMy wife is also a huge Taylor Swift fan and wasn\u2019t able to go to her concert this year. Apparently, after we got the news that we\u2019re not having a baby, she got on the phone with her best friend (24M), and they decided to go to one of the shows. However, it was \u201ceasier\u201d to get tickets to an international show (we live in the US). Which means we\u2019d have to pay for flights, hotels cf, etc along with the tickets when there\u2019s literally a movie version for twenty bucks.\n\nShe paid for all of that without asking me. Now, we have a joint account and don\u2019t usually consult each other on purchases. However, this was almost two thousand dollars when we\u2019ve already been wiped out by IVF treatments. Also, I am the primary breadwinner. I don\u2019t mind making most of the money while she explores career options, but ~90% of our savings is money I contributed.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be TA: when I saw the charges on our account and asked my wife to explain, I ended up getting angry and telling her I \u201ccouldn\u2019t trust her with my money,\u201d after which I transferred the vast majority of our savings to my private bank account. I know I shouldn\u2019t have phrased it like that, but I refuse to let her make more significant financial decisions right now. We literally can\u2019t afford another payment like this.\n\nShe says I\u2019m \u201cpunishing\u201d her when she\u2019s grieving.

You aren't an AH for being upset about that, or for worrying if she will do it again, but the idea that you would just cut off her access to money and smugly be like \"I'm the practical one\" is what makes you an AH. \n\nHow about asking her what's going on? Talking about how you can't afford this? Asking her about getting some therapy? Maybe even being happy for her doing this but saying now you two really need to tighten your belts and start saving again?\n\nPart of being in a partnership is carrying the weight sometimes- that can be financial, emotional, or even logical.

I\u2019m not saying this was a wise choice, but try to account for how much she\u2019s spent on herself since starting IVF- has she done trips? Has she gone anywhere with girlfriends?

Does she feel that you\u2019re overreacting about how \u201cwiped out\u201d you guys are? \n\nPlease understand that there is a difference between being practical and being supportive. $2,000 for an international trip + concert tickets is reasonable. If your issue is what your account was drained down to due to IVF, talk to her about THAT, and be willing to hear that she doesn\u2019t agree so she didn\u2019t think this was a big deal.

We both want kids, but she has fertility issues, so we\u2019ve been doing IVF for the past two years with no luck. The last time, my wife convinced herself she was going to get pregnant, so when it didn\u2019t work, she was crushed. I was sad, too, but I told her we\u2019d get through this and try again.\nMy wife is also a huge Taylor Swift fan and wasn\u2019t able to go to her concert this year. Apparently, after we got the news that we\u2019re not having a baby, she got on the phone with her best friend (24M), and they decided to go to one of the shows. However, it was \u201ceasier\u201d to get tickets to an international show (we live in the US). Which means we\u2019d have to pay for flights, hotels cf, etc along with the tickets when there\u2019s literally a movie version for twenty bucks.\nShe paid for all of that without asking me. Now, we have a joint account and don\u2019t usually consult each other on purchases. However, this was almost two thousand dollars when we\u2019ve already been wiped out by IVF treatments. Also, I am the primary breadwinner. I don\u2019t mind making most of the money while she explores career options, but ~90% of our savings is money I contributed.\nHere\u2019s where I might be TA: when I saw the charges on our account and asked my wife to explain, I ended up getting angry and telling her I \u201ccouldn\u2019t trust her with my money,\u201d after which I transferred the vast majority of our savings to my private bank account. I know I shouldn\u2019t have phrased it like that, but I refuse to let her make more significant financial decisions right now. We literally can\u2019t afford another payment like this.\nShe says I\u2019m \u201cpunishing\u201d her when she\u2019s grieving. I think I\u2019m being practical.\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
