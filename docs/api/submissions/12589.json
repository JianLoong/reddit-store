She thinks it's rude? Does she not think it's rude to bring company over to the apartment in the middle of the night when other residents are trying to sleep. I really wanted to say N A H for this situation, but your wife's reaction to your suggestion makes her the A H and a hypocrite.", "NTA\n\nUnless your wife is asking you to participate why do you need to be there? Sounds like a perfect solution. She gets to spend time & have fun with friends, you get yourself a quiet hotel room & get to relax. Win, Win!!", "NTA. I thought you were going to suggest that they stay at a hotel. I would\u2019ve still considered you NTA in that situation but, you offering to leave the house so they can do their thing is even nicer. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being rude or weird at all.", "NTA your wife cares about optics rather you being comfortable", "Nah talk to your wife and see why your participation in these events matter so much to her. See if she is feeling insecure about something else.", "How often does it happen? How many friends are we talking about?", "NTA. You wouldn't be the rude one in this scenario.", "NTA: you deserve to have peace and quiet", "NTA.  \n\nIt doesnt matter how your absence appears to her friends, that isnt important.\n\nMaybe a better solution would be for your wife and her friends to get a hotel room on the nights they go out.  That way they are not rude coming in at 3am waking you up, and most hotels rooms offer rooms with 2 queen beds and a sofa, so that probably offers more sleeping accommodations for them than a one bed flat .", "NAH, there's nothing wrong with wanting her to take her partying elsewhere. Communicate the issue, it (hopefully) isn't impossible to work out", "NTA  Tell your wife that it is no more rude than having people stay overnight in such a small place. It is no more rude than staying up until 3 am when there is someone else who lives there. It is no more  rude than not leaving immediately in the morning.  You are trying to give her space to do as she wants but she needs to reciprocate and give you your space too. If it can't be done in the same apartment then hotel is the best option.", "I mouth-vomited when he referred to his wife as the \u201cjoint\u201d tenant\u201d. 6 times a year she has her friends over, and those 6 days are are just too much for poor little you to accept. It seems like you are jealous of the fact your wife has friends and lonely solitary you, the privacy seeker that you are, do not. Go get your hotel room friend, my money is on the idea it would be a lot more fun with you out of the picture. YTA, and grow up the world is not all about you. After 356 days of nothing but you, she deserves a party for surviving. EDIT: my addition sucks. 359 days, not 356.", "Yta. I read that this happens in frequently. It would be a it weird and obviously does bother your wife if you get a hotel.\n\nYou're entitled to your peace and quiet, which you get 59 of 60 days. She's also allowed to have fun with her friends once in a while without having to feel guilty about it.\n\nAnd that's what would happen if you went to the hotel. You're turning her rate trips out with you her friend into a whole thing instead of just dealing with it once every two or three months.", "YTA These are not the visits that happen every month. Your wife is very enthu about it\n\nI too am an introvert with most of my family decidedly not so. I blank out their guests with movie marathons, books with ear plugs in, or even go out alone in local gardens. Someone I know takes an ipad in the washroom to spend a couple of hours away from guests. Another guy simply binge watches movies in a local theatre. A young girl I know picks up overtime work rather than attend her mother's dinner parties at home\n\nThe world is not ready for introverts by and large.", "NTA. Your wife thinks you wanting to stay in a hotel so you can have peace whilst she has fun with her friends is rude? In an apartment you are joint tenants of? I think she's the rude one for ignoring how uncomfortable she is making you in your own home. Your offer was very generous, possibly too generous as you have the right to some boundaries in your own home.", "NTA - you don\u2019t say how often this happens. If it is a couple of times a year or once a month - I\u2019d say just suck it up, but no harm to her if you get a hotel (unless it\u2019s a $ issue). If this happens on the regular like every week she is the AH and hasn\u2019t crossed the maturity line from teenage/college thinking to adult-relationship hood.", "NTA. It\u2019s rude of her to have overnight guests in a small place when she knows you don\u2019t like it.", "YTA - I mean how often does this actually happen?? your wife should be able to go out and come home safely with her friends and still have some fun. Don\u2019t be that guy", "NTA or ESH. Somewhere in between.\n\nI am the same as you when it comes to my place so I totally understand your feelings here. That said, offering to get a hotel room is too extreme and comes off manipulative/guilt trip-ey. I think it would be better to just assert yourself as an equal member of the household and ask your wife to mind the noise late at night and perhaps to not have overnights at your place so often. Maybe they can do that at her friends' places instead.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why?  What are you supposed to be doing while she is entertaining her guests?  No, while she is relaxing with her friends, treat yourself with something that makes you happy.  Make it a guys day when she is having a girls' day.", "NTA. It\u2019s a really good suggestion.", "NTA - you\u2019re suggesting an accommodation so you can both have what you need. She wants fun social time with her friends, you want peace and quiet. This is a reasonable suggestion so both of your (valid) desires are fulfilled. The only tweak I\u2019d suggest is that she and her friends get the hotel room - depending how loud they are you don\u2019t want neighbour issues. Plus, it may help convince your wife it\u2019s a good idea, as a hotel is a fun treat for a girls\u2019 night.", "NTA.  Your solution is quite considerate actually.  You get sleep and don't have to be a bear and tell them to keep it down or interrupt their fun.", "NAH ... how about instead of your wife saying you went to a hotel to \"escape\", she tells her friends that you wanted them to be able to enjoy each other's company for a true girls night without you getting in the way, so you decided to stay at a hotel for the night.", "NTA. It's rude of them to be so disruptive in your shared home.", "My only concern would be if your finances can handle this. Other than that, and TA. Personally, I would not allow that shit.

I like her friends but the flat is where I unwind and relax. I'm a bit of an introvert", "If he was raising issues with her having the guests a few times a year  and denying her the ability to do so in her house I would agree with you. All he is doing is creating a safe space for himself when he is in a situation that is overwhelming to him. He is not being rude. He is aware of his ability to cope with a situation and coming up with asolution that allows them both to have what they want. She gets her friends visiting, he gets peace.  NTA", "He\u2019s NTA for wanting to get a room but that joint tenant bs did not land well with me either.\n\nCan you imagine if she wasn\u2019t a joint tenant?

It\u2019s not a frequent occurrence.", "She has one guest over every few months. It\u2019s not a frequent occurrence.", "How is he TA? He is not telling his GF she can't invite her friends over, he just wants to go to a hotel when they do so he can rest. They would still have a safe space to go after their nights out, he simply won't be there\n\nNTA OP, you want peace at quiet during the night and suggested a solution that would allow your GF to still invite her friends and enjoy herself.", "Maybe every couple of months? Also I'm not saying she can't go out but I don't want to be disturbed when they come home late.", "There is a reason you are being downvoted, let\u2019s see if you are smart enough to realise why\u2026. Highly doubtful though.", "Isn't OP entitled to a little bit of time out of the apartment too? He can enjoy some peace and relaxation at a hotel while his wife gets to party. It's a win-win situation.", "Why can't he get the \"fun treat\"? I mean his wife is going out and treating herself with drinks, dinner etc. He can treat himself with a hotel room. Seems fair.\n\nNTA", "Hahah, it was to pre answer any questions to who's flat is was. I would never refer to her as a joint tenant normally", "Meh, one friend once/twice a quarter.
