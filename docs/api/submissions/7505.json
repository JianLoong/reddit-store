We can see through the west crevice that the dog is just out in the airplane. During this time, the crew had also started the meal service. \n\nThere was a definite \u201cdog smell\u201d in our area, but not sure if it was from the dog being out or having 2 dogs right next to each other.\n\nMy wife and I are literally staring at this dog in front of us being out and are debating whether or not it\u2019s allowed. We didn\u2019t want to bring it up to a flight attendant if it was allowed only to look stupid and potentially make enemies, so we decided to wait it out. As the meal service got closer to us, they started scrambling to put the dog back in its case. A flight attendant saw and told them it wasn\u2019t allowed and that the dog shouldn\u2019t be out. They tried explaining something to the them but they just said it\u2019s against the rules and left it at that. At this point we now knew it wasn\u2019t allowed and would raise our concerns if it happened again. \n\nA few hours go by and it happened again. The flight attendant was right next to us and my wife told him the dog was out so they got scolded yet again and the husband tried explaining it was an emergency and that they were trying to calm the dog but they again said rules are rules. A few minutes later another one came and a bit more sternly said that they should not have another situation where another flight attendant has to say something to them again and that without a medical note saying the dog is supposed to be out, the dog is to remain in the carrier. \n\nThen, an hour or so before the flight is about to land, the husband turns to us and apologizes for the flight and for their dog and tells us that they had to book this flight in an emergency as her wife\u2019s parents had a tragic accident and they were doing whatever they could to get there. \n\nAt this point, my wife and I just look at each other and are now feeling like AHoles.

I'm not one for arbitrary rules per se, but this seems like a valid safety concern.", "Nta, their's reasons for the dog being to be in the carrier on the plane,  regardless of what's going on in their life,  they have to follow the same rules that everyone else has to follow.", "NTA. Dogs out of the crate are a safety and sanitation issue. They can run off, they can bite someone, and in an 8-hour flight they're going to have to pee and poop at a certain point. There is a reason that there are rules about this.", "NTA. The rules inside a plane doesn't change just because someone dies.", "NTA. My mom\u2019s a flight attendant and you would not believe the stories about dogs pooping and running around the aisleways, attacking people, etc that all flight attendants have. Unless it\u2019s a Service Dog, it should be in the crate.", "NTA. A loose dog in an airplane cabin can become a projectile in case of turbulence, and it will need to piss and shit at some point. They should not have had it out of it's carrier.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think these Y T As actually understand why these rules are in place. They\u2019re there for the safety of everyone, having the dog out was a safety issue and honestly you shouldn\u2019t even be taking a dog on an 8 hour flight I mean wtf", "Are you sure that's the truth or were the dog couple lying to make you feel bad, you'll never know. Either way an emergency is not reason to break the rules if not life threatening. Will taking the dog out make the plane go faster no...honestly it runs the risk of landing unexpectedly due to riders not obeying the rules. NTA and don't think about it. Plus I wouldn't want a bunch of fur flying around, I donno about all animals but when my cat or dog stresses it sheds more, thank you vet trips I leave looking like a balding yeti.", "The attendants were clearly addressing the matter. Not sure why you were even involved.  I'm not going to say you're an ass but, it is pretty close.", "ESH. It's safer for the dog and passengers to be in its crate, and they had already been told.  However, you realize that dog carriers are ventilated, right? If you're going to smell it on their lap, you will smell it sitting 2.5 feet below their lap too. Your post just reeks of being put out by the dog being there at all - you weren't worried about it being crated for safety, but because you were butthurt that dog people sat near you. I'm a teacher, and I was just thinking this morning about how to explain tattling to kids - how it's one thing to tell an adult if there is a real problem, and it's another thing to complain just because you think someone deserves to get in trouble for what they are doing. Again, yes, the dog should have been put away - but you guys were tattling and you know it, which is why you felt shitty when you heard of their loss.", "The reasons for their flight are irrelevant.

Reasonable people would not insist on being told  multiple times.\n\nNTA", "Dogs can only be in planes if they are actual service dogs or if a pet dog is small and stays in the carrier.  The rules are there for a reason, and they need to be in their carrier.  Pet dogs usually aren\u2019t acclimated to enough sorts of situations, and cannot be trusted to be calm enough to be out on a flight. \n\nWorry about the dog being out when the rules are **clear** is enough reason to tell the flight attendants.  Given their reactions, the flight attendants cared that they keep the dog contained.", "NTA -- very valid safety concern.  I am surprised the flight attendants let the do all this", "Sorry, I'm going YTA, unless I've misunderstood, in which case I'll change my ruling.\n\n\nThe dog wasn't doing anything bad as a result of being out of the crate, right? In fact they probably got it out so it would bark less and be less annoying for other passengers. You weren't actually being inconvenienced any more than if the dog was in the crate. Why opt for making people feel worse? Yes, it was against the rules. But nothing bad was happening that wouldnt still be happening otherwise, so I'm not sure why you cared?", "INFO: Was them having the dog out of the carrier causing an additional inconvenience to you?\n\n1. If yes that you are NTA, it's sad that they are going through a tough time but that doesn't really have anything to do with having their dog out\n2. If no then ESH because at that point it seems like you're just trying to inconvenience them because you ended up stuck next to two dogs.", "NTA - it technically was against the rules and you didnt know why they were traveling. Personally, i wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved though.", "Edit to say I hadn\u2019t thought about the safety issue until it was pointed out. NTA \n\nI am back and forth about this one. I feel like E S H actually. The couple shouldn\u2019t have kept taking the dog out after they were told not to. You are also kind of the AH if the dog wasn\u2019t actually bothering you. It\u2019s one of those situations where if it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone, assuming you are not allergic, then why rat them out?", "I\u2019d probably say YTA, I could understand if the dog was barking or trying to eat your food.  It doesn\u2019t sound like it was doing anything besides sitting, and they probably were trying to calm it down.  I\u2019m not sure why you would want to get involved instead of allowing the flight attendant to deal with it.", "NTA. rules are rules", "How are people saying YTA?\n\nRules are rules. And it's bad enough the air isn't exactly fresh. I adore dogs, but what if someone was allergic and the dog trotted down to them? Not to mention the safety issues of having a dog flapping around. Who you gonna sue when the flight experiences extreme turbulence and it hit it's head on the hard bit of a seat and got serious damage? The dog doesn't exactly hear the pilot announce \"turbulence\" and thinks \"oh I need to return to my seat now?\"\nOwners are the AH. They wanna take a dog on an 8 HR flight? Their issue.", "YTA. You were tattling. It didn't affect you in anyway whatsoever. The dogs didn't jump out their arms and run away, they didn't growl at you or attack you. The dog smell wouldn't be too different from in the carrier or out of it.", "NTA, there are probably very good reasons for the rules because even the best behaved animal can be unpredictable in a new situation.", "I'm gonna say yeah YTA because it doesn't sound the dog was being aggressive or obnoxious to you and your wife or anything.", "NTA - As someone with huge dog allergies, my vacation could be ruined by people who can't follow rules.", "As someone with animal allergies who reacts really randomly to different breeds, NTA. I\u2019ve had allergic reactions on planes that have either made it impossible for me to see anything at all (cat in a carrier) or sneezing so much I end up with a migraine (doggo too close and their carrier was opened. Multiple times. The owner touched the arm of my seat when I was in the bathroom and I ended up with a rash over a good 3 inches of my wrist. Thank you for alerting flight crew about that dog.", "YTA. \"Dog smell\" wouldn't really have been much different with the dog in the carrier vs. out of the carrier. So why were you so concerned about them breaking the rule? Seems like they were trying to quiet/calm the animal so as to reduce the noise disturbance.\n\nI understand not wanting to sit by numerous animals for 8 hours, but if that was really going to bug you then why didn't you look for different seats as well?", "YTA.  It doesn't sound like the dog was actually doing anything that inconvenienced you, so why report them? The dog is still a couple feet in front of you whether it's in a carrier or on their lap.  So long as the dog wasn't running around the cabin, growling at you, touching you, or trying to climb over the seat to get to you, I don't think you had any valid reason to complain or report them.  You are a petty, controlling, vengeful person, shame on you.", "YTA.\n\nLook, if you had said something because you were concerned about the safety of the dog being out it would have been fine. You weren't though, you were just tattleing because you were annoyed the dig was there in the first place, and all you likely succeeded in doing is making everyone's day worse, theirs because they couldn't comfort their likely terrified dog, and everyone else including yours because the barking was likely worse because the dog was stuck in the carrier. It's not the action itself that was inherently YTA or NTA, it was your motive.", "YTA. How was the dog being out of it's carrier affecting you? Why did you feel the need to snitch?", "NTA \n\nThe dog could have gotten loose if plane hit turbulence. It\u2019s against the rules for various reasons.", "YTA.", "YTA", "YTA.

Not only is it against the rules but your bringing an animal to a strange place with strange people on a strange environment. They could react badly, even run.\n\nNTA", "NTA. They knew what they were doing is not acceptable. When you read on the website how the heck to book an animal in carryon, it emphasizes that the animal cannot be out of the carrier at any point. When you purchase the add-on to the ticket to book the animal as a carry-on, it emphasizes again that the animal cannot be out of the carrier at any point. When you check in the animal at the airport, the clerk gives the same speech and makes you sign a document saying you understand and agree to those terms. There is simply no way they boarded that plane without having been lectured on this at least once. They decided the rules don't apply to them.\n\nAlso the airlines deliberately book few dogs in any given cabin class and they try to seat them apart. Deliberately arranged to minimize disruptions such as barking at each other. As soon as these dog owners moved seats, they were creating a problem that didn't need to exist. The solution was to move back to their assigned seats.\n\nFinally, if the animal doesn't fit under the seat, that's a safety problem for humans and animals alike. In an emergency, that slow down evacuation and becomes a distraction that flight attendants have to deal with. As soon as the carrier didn't fit under the seat fully, they should have returned to the seat where it does fit, or else summoned a flight attendant to help them be reseated somewhere appropriate.\n\nThey guilt tripped you with the story about a dead relative. Don't feel bad for them. Grieving people are capable of traveling with a pet without behaving like an entitled asshole, and not endangering other passengers.", "YTA, the dogs weren't bothering you. And they WEREN'T shrieking infants, you don't realize how lucky you were yet still found something to complain about. Yikes.", "What's the safety concern?  The people said it was an emergency.

What if dog pees (carriers have floor and lower siding to keep anything in there)", " One, The dog isn\u2019t a service animal. Secondly, they don\u2019t get special privileges because someone died. There are rules in the plane for a reason. If the passengers find the rules inconvenient, there are other ways to travel - granted those ways may be slower. The planes have these rules for safety reasons and is unrelated to convenience.", "It doesn\u2019t matter why they were traveling.  They still needed to keep the dog in the carrier.", "If the plane hits turbulence, dog goes flying and is a safety concern.", "They have these rules for safety. Planes can be terrifying for animals and it's not uncommon for them to freak out but freaking out can include escaping the seat or biting. Or if they'd hit turbulence and lost a grip on the dog it can get hurt. There are a Ton of reasons why these rules exist. It's not like they were sitting outside at a restaurant and didn't want to be near it. Even if the dog was nervous they can't break rules and expect no one to say anything. The flight attendants warned them, were they embarrassed at being called out sure. But it is on them for breaking the rules and they were still able to remain on the flight and make it to their destination.\n\nSo op, NTA", "The dogs WERE barking at each other.  They are less likely to be agitated by the other dog if they are in the carrier and can\u2019t see them.  Also, people with small dogs who don\u2019t follow the dog rules tend (not definite, but my in my experience very often) have poorly behaved dogs.  \u201cSmall dog syndrome\u201d is a real problem where little dogs are poorly behaved and a social nuisance at best.  These dogs tend to nip and bite and it obey.  It\u2019s not the dog\u2019s size, it\u2019s the owners tend to baby little dogs, and fail to train them.

Everyone wants to talk about safety but is ignoring the fact that them pulling the pet out of the carrier and having them around causes the dander to fly much further. Allergies are a thing.

Do you not remember the story of the mom with toddler and a dog in a carrier? Carrier didn't fit under the seat and the ignorant flight attendant made her put the carrier up above and the dog died. We had an issue with booking with our dogs once where we were allowed to pick seats that wouldn't accommodate them. I called the airline to fix it and they said don't worry we'll just make people change seats day of. I said no thanks and we cancelled and rebooked.", "In a time where people with disabilities are suing airlines for not getting accommodations they are legally mandated under federal law, I think you're being a little naive here.", "You\u2019d be surprised about babies on planes. Changing diapers on the tray tables is the least of it.", "In this case,  when a person should just mind their own business,  yes. People cutting \"safety\" as a whatabout opens the door for overall plane safety whataboutisms.", "Babies aren't a rule, dogs are.  If they felt unsafe, etc, have allergies, etc, they have a right.  Rules are rules, you're whatabouting to babies.  Not me.  So save it.", "Have you never seen a baby have their diaper changed on the tray table? Cause I've seen it three times.  People eat off of those. And like holding a baby is not the same as a seatbelt. People are holding their dogs too.", "NTA tragic accidents suck, but what a shitty excuse for not following the rules.", "YTA", "NTA", "I mean rules are rules but I laughed at this. Y'all sound like some 3rd graders watching and waiting to tattle.", "YTA. I'm suspicious of people who don't like animals, especially dogs. Mind your business.", "I wish they had separate pet and kid friendly flights.

Even if not, regulators have decided that this risk is reasonable given the benefit of having a kid consoled by its parent instead of losing their minds. I say this as a child free passenger - do whatever you have to do to calm that baby down. However, it\u2019s reasonable that they don\u2019t want to ADD to the risk by allowing additional projectiles semi-loose when they otherwise weren\u2019t in need of hands on care. \n\nA baby can also do less damage being left to crawl or toddle slowly through the cabin. A terrified dog can do some damage quickly. And you know the asshole that can\u2019t control their dog is the exact asshole that would let them get loose.   \n\nIf there is an easy way to minimize the risk at no additional cost to all involved, it\u2019s put your dog in its carrier under the seat.", "no one else is brave enough to upvote this lol", "Toddlers usually wear diapers and usually can't do as much harm as a dog when biting, but otherwise I agree.", "Have you ever seen a blow out? That can get everywhere.", "In the event of an emergency requiring evacuation having the dog crated removes a tripping hazard. Additionally it\u2019s a high stress situation, you never know how the dog is going to react. Throw in that turbulence and it\u2019s flying stressed out back of teeth. All unlikely yes, but it\u2019s a mix of covering their ass and that something has likely happened in the past."]}
