Before my SIL gave birth her and i had sat down 2 weeks before and talked about the silly nick names to which we picked one and i said \"Okay this is offically what his nickname from his auntie will be!\" to which she replied with \" Oh my God thats adorable I love that!\" - the nickname is Owenator.\n\nFast Forward to when they came home afterwards that my SIL said that essentially all of us had to make an appointment in order to meet the baby. She told all of us that she wanted immediate family to meet him first. Now correct me if I'm wrong but I've always known that In Laws are considered \"immediate family\" well apparently we weren't. i didn't get to meet Owen until he was THREE WEEKS OLD. When I finally got to meet him  she made me wear a mask, wash my hands and use hand sanitizer before i could hold him which i had abolutely no issue doing them but it was enforced so agressivley by her it felt like she was scolding me like a child.  While I was there my husband and I took pictures of him and us holding him, the usual. When we got home later I posted the pictures to fb and captioned it \"Got to meet my favorite little man today\" 20 minutes later my SIL commented saying \"You mean MY little man?\"\n\nSince then, any piictures I've taken of him or even with him and captioning it with things like: My lil dude, My little man, My little Owenator etc. well, whenever this happens she will comment on them saying : \"You mean MY little man (dude, etc\", her and I have had mutiple conversations about thisand how I can't call him anything that starts with \"My\". This has been happening since the day he was born.\n\nMy SIL had a conversation asking why I can't say it recently to which she responded with \"Because you haven't gone through sleepless nights, 2 days of labor, constant pain NOTHING\" now I should probably mention that I have a disease that makes it VERY hard for me to even get pregnant and I may not even be able to get pregnant. she continued to explode on me and I simply responded with \"Look, he's your child but he's also my nephew and if loving your son \"too much\" then count me out of his childhood.\" But of course, she spun around and started crying saying how family is so important to her and she want's me to be part of his life.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for using the word My infront of any term of endearment for my nephew?", "created_utc": 1681843653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qzxm1/aita_for_calling_my_nephew_my_lil_dude/", "score": 428, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She had every right to dictate when people meet the baby. And she has every right to mandate hand washing, masks, etc. I don\u2019t think you were the AH for your initial statement of \u201cmy favorite little man.\u201d I read that as him being your favorite, not him being yours. She overreacted to that. However, since then, it sounds like you have been purposely antagonizing her. And to say she might as well cut you out of his childhood if she doesn\u2019t allow you to cross her boundaries is definitely an AH move.", "YTA\n\nNot your kid.  When SIL corrected you about calling him \"My little \\_\\_\\_\", you doubled down on social media.  Of course you pissed her off.\n\n\"i didn't get to meet Owen until he was THREE WEEKS OLD.\"\n\nGet over yourself.  These days, most parents don't want people over for a full 2 weeks before they start taking visitors.  They need to get settled and start a feeding/eating routine, without interference.  Also  first round of vaccines and DR follow-ups.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou are projecting some clingy vibes here. In a vacuum, the phrase is pretty innocuous -- but if you're the type of person to complain about having to wait three weeks, and then rushing to post pictures on social media and every single one of your captions includes \"My ...\" then I could see where you're being kind of weird and mom probably needs to set some boundaries.", "The next time you post refer to him as \u201cmy little nephew\u201c and see if she responds with \u201cyou mean MY nephew\u201d\n\nNTA.  Thank god my siblings and in-laws let me be a part of my nibblings\u2019 lives", "NTA some people are delusional lol", "> When we got home later I posted the pictures to fb and captioned it \"Got to meet my favorite little man today\" 20 minutes later my SIL commented saying \"You mean MY little man?\"\n\nLOL, I'm sorry, she's getting mad because she literally doesn't understand how words work?  NTA.", "Say my little nephew", "Everyone in this story needs more to do with their day clearly.", "NTA\nYou obviously love your Nephew. Uhm I mean THIS nephew.\nAnd you should be able to express that and saying \"My lil dude\" and such is perfectly normal.\nOne of my friends had a baby a couple months back and I always say stuff like \"Aww my little baby! My little Kamali!\" and she doesn't mind. And honestly why would she? It's just a way to talk it doesn't mean you own your - I mean THIS nephew lol.\nAnd no disrespect to her but is she going to use the fact that she carried and birthed him forever to make some weird point?\nIf I were your sister in law I'd be so happy to have family who cares for him.\nI honestly do not understand the issue.\nWhat I also think it's weird is the fact that she let's anyone post pictures of him on social media THATS the only real issue imo.\nShe seems honestly very childish in the way she handled the Instagram posts and everything.\nI don't have any advice for you except cool off and just don't say \"my\" when she's around.", "NTA, she\u2019s being a little over the top, but she\u2019s the mom and if she wants you to stop phrasing nicknames in a certain way, you should respect her wish as The Owenator\u2019s mother. \n\nWhat you ARE TA for is how you negatively talk about their visitation and hygiene requirements. Newborns are EXTREMELY susceptible to germs and illness as they have next to no immune system. You\u2019re lucky she even let you meet your nephew, I had my kid in 2020 (at the height of the pandemic) and there were family members who didn\u2019t get to meet them for MONTHS. And ya know what? That was ok because the rules that my husband and I decided was how things went.", "ESH, you all sound really annoying.", "NTA. It\u2019s a term of endearment. Nobody seriously thinks it\u2019s staking to claim of parenthood/ownership etc. \n\nDon\u2019t use it again since it causes such a problem but my god.  No", "YTA for continuing to do it when you know it bothers her. There are so many ways to show affection without using the word \"my\". You seem to have a problem with her stemming from the fact you had to wait 3 weeks to see him.", "NTA this sister in law sounds like she needs to relax a bit", "Slight YTA \n\n3 weeks is not an unusually long time to meet a new baby. And enforcing hand washing and masks isn\u2019t treating you like a child. She\u2019s a new mother just trying to protect her child. There was literally just a global pandemic and Covid is still around. \n\nBut you saying \u201cmy\u201d isn\u2019t that big of the deal. That doesn\u2019t mean you claiming as your own, nor invalidate her as a mother. But once she corrected you that should have been the end of it you should have stopped. Like you made multiple post using \u201cmy\u201d knowing she wouldn\u2019t like it and then played victim when she said something.", "ESH, but politely toward your SIL because she JUST had a baby, and only partially toward you because of the attitude you have about having to wear a mask and wash your hands around a newborn baby. Your SIL can (and probably will) lighten up a little about anyone calling them \"my xxx,\" but I'd probably just respect what they want for now. If you say anything at all, don't say it to her. Also, respect what new parents want. That should be a given. If they tell you not to kiss their baby, DON'T. If they tell you to wash your hands and wear a mask around a baby that barely has an immune system, DO IT. No complaints. She's being nitpicky, but you seem to not know anything about being around a baby if wearing a mask and washing your hands is bothersome in any way. Also, it's totally normal for new parents to need a break and to tell people when they're allowed to come over right after a baby is born.", "YTA, if it bothers her, why are you provoking her? At no point did you say that you captioned the pictures with the word \"nephew\", so it's reasonable to expect that you're presenting it as though you're more involved in your nephews life than you actually are. Honestly, just get off social media and spend quality time with your extended family (immediate would be parent, child or sibling, which you are none of).", "NTA. He is your nephew", "NTA for using those terms of endearment for your nephew. They sound perfectly normal to me.\n\nYou SIL is over the top, in my opinion, in consistently (according to you) commenting \"You mean MY (fill in blank)?\" Wow.", "INFO: Is your SIL your husband's sister or your husband's brother's wife? How many pictures of the kid have you been posting and did you ask the parents if you could do that? How many conversations about this have the two of you had in the past five months since the baby was born?", "NTA. Your SIL sounds over the top. To give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe her hormones are still all over the place and she doesn't realize how ridiculous she sounds.", "NTA unless we're missing additional details. Only reddit would think those sorts of names mean you're taking possession of him.\n\nThat being said, this isn't a hill worth dying on. If the price of staying in his life is giving up nicknames that start with \"my\" it might be a price worth paying.", "Sure, she's being over-the-top, but how does it hurt you to not use that phrasing? People who are completely unwilling to compromise on stuff like this so often think they're Taking A Stand or whatever, but why is it worth it? She's going through a stressful time of life, help her by not using that phrasing, even if it feels silly.", "NTA you didn't say anything bad about her son why is she getting so aggressive, it's all for no reason, if you say 'my lil nephew' what will she say? 'you mean my'? Like come on wtf, she has issues that she should look at. Yes he is your little dude as he is his mother's little dude as he is his grandma's little dude.", "YTA. Is it a normal term of endearment? Yeah.  But is mom going through a whirlwind of postpartum hormones and asking you to do something very simple, which you are absolutely refusing to do? Absolutely. She\u2019s being slightly over the top in her request, but as a new mother I don\u2019t consider this weird at all. You are intentionally antagonizing her. \n\nIt is also incredibly normal for a new mother to demand you follow strong health concerns when meeting her child. This little human has no immune system yet, and we\u2019re in a strong RSV season. For you to complain about this is very entitled. \n\nYour personal fertility journey is not relevant. It\u2019s a red herring. \n\nApologize to your sister.", "NTA/ESH - calling someone my lil dude is normal. The people on this sub are batshit insane at times lol. But you should've stopped earlier and just distanced yourself. It's her baby her rules, you do need to respect that. SIL, yeah she's exhausted, but she shouldn't get triggered by you doing that, she needs some sort of therapy or something. The way she was crying about family is everything means that she was probably worried of losing free babysitting so be careful", "YTA through & through. \n\nIf someone specifically asks you not to do something with their baby, you don\u2019t do it. ESPECIALLY the mother who just gave birth. Do you have no concept on how postpartum works? Momma may be sensitive and set boundaries that YOU don\u2019t like, but that doesn\u2019t give you any right to disrespect her or the boundaries. If she asks you not to call him something or use a certain term, simply don\u2019t do it. It hurts you in no way to just call him something else, and to not double down when asked. Not being able to do the small stuff leads moms to believe that you won\u2019t respect bigger wishes down the road, and no one wants that. Just do the easy, small stuff now & it\u2019ll most likely pass. If it continues to be such a huge disagreement, revisit the idea later. But honestly, I see how you may come off too strong in her eyes, and this isn\u2019t the hill you want to die on. Don\u2019t deprive yourself of this kiddo\u2019s childhood just because of some words that you can easily change, and don\u2019t double down when a new mom makes a boundary.", "Wow wow wow\nAs an Aunt I would be completely offended by those corrections. He is my precious nephew. He\u2019s your precious son, this is not a competition, you\u2019ll always be mom. I\u2019ll be just Aunt. \n\nHowever, to keep the peace with her, just quit. Call him the precious nephew, aunties best nephew, whatever. It\u2019s not worth the fight. \n\nNTA", "YTA. It seems like you mean well and are excited for your new nephew, but you can't be locked in a power struggle/pissing contest with your SIL. It's also normal to not meet a newborn baby until a few weeks after they're born, they're vulnerable to sickness.\n\nYou posting \"meeting my favorite little man\" with pictures of a newborn baby seems like a very covert attempt to pass him off as your own. Or at least get comments asking if you had a baby. That's why your SIL is annoyed. \n\nYour SIL has a lot of post partum hormones and protectiveness, and it's important to respect that. If you can respect her boundaries as his mother, I'm sure you guys will have a better relationship, and you'll get more time with your nephew.", "I LOVE THIS!!!! Omg, delicious! The entitlement! The audacity lol honey, he\u2019s your nephew. I\u2019m sure it is very exciting but you doubled down on the whole ownership thing. There are so many other avenues you could have taken or discussed but no, you pissed and moaned about this and here you are. The fact that you bringing up your health concerns (re:pregnancy) really cements it. So, is every baby you know going to be YOUR baby with your logic? You wanting to have a close relationship with him is admirable and I do wish you well but you have to reel it in. He\u2019s not yours. I have a cool aunt whom I love, she is my safe space, I know I can tell her anything and she will be there. But she respects the hell out of my Mom. YTA", "ESH for how you talk about your inlaw's rules, she is their mum and has all rights to dictate how and when. The \"my\" argument is just stupid, and what does owenator mean..", "NTA. Just because she gave birth to him doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be your favorite little man. She needs to calm the fuck down.", "ESH. But mostly OP. \n\nIt's very normal to wait a couple week to meet a newborn. Three weeks is nothing. You don't have rights to that baby, nephew or not. Mask and clean hands also very normal. \n\nSIL is weirdly possessive (but... so is OP) . It's not like calling him \"my baby.\" But she's a new mom so just a little slightly AH. Do the grandparents not see him and call him \"my darling, my sweet boy, my heart, my love?\" Does SIL only correct you with using my? If she does it with everyone, maybe change your captions to \"my little nephew, the Owenator\" as that's technically correct or \"the awesomest little dude you'll ever see.\" If it's only you that SIL corrects maybe she fears you being too possessive because of your health issues about potentially not having your own children in the future, especially since you seemed to claim a special nickname that is kinda implied that only you can use.", "If you know the phrase is bothering your sister. Use the phrase '\u00e0unties little dude' instead. Do you think she is over stressed  dealing with lack of sleep?", "YTA \n\nNot your kid; therefore the use of \"my\" is not appropriate unless you are saying \"my nephew\" which is correct.  Also, this is your sister in law and brother in law, likely meaning your spouse's sibling and partner... that makes you extended family.\n\nAlso, you're petty for being so obviously upset that you had to wait THREE WEEKS and have to do decent safety measures for a 3 week old infant in the current health crisis.", "YTA. Also, what\u2019s wrong with you? There\u2019s no need to pick a fight with a concerned new mom.", "She sounds like a pill but if it\u2019s that important to her better to just not do it. Funny, when I post about my niece and nephews I always stop myself from saying \u201cmy\u201d besides \u201cmy favorite\u201d even though nobody in my family would have an issue, I just don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it. Especially if it\u2019s my husbands nephew or niece yes I consider them my family too but wouldn\u2019t want to get too familiar in that way. And I don\u2019t think 3 weeks is a long time to meet a newborn in todays day and age with covid and colds and flu and RSV running rampant. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite an AH but you could knock it off if it bothers her, and don\u2019t take it personally that you couldn\u2019t meet the baby sooner. Times have changed a lot since covid.", "I say both: YTA and NTA for different reasons.\n\nYTA for getting upset over the fact that you only met him at 3 weeks old. Do you know how short 3 weeks are? He\u2019s a baby, they\u2019re fragile, she had just given birth, they\u2019re still trying very hard to find their legs as parents. You have no right to be upset over when a parent decides they\u2019d like family to meet their newborn. I was strict af after my son was born (it was during the height of covid) and babies are so susceptible to diseases, it wasn\u2019t a risk I was willing to take and still isn\u2019t. No one was allowed to kiss my baby under any circumstances and me and my husband gave them so much shit if they ever did.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have a condition which makes it tough for you to get pregnant, but it\u2019s not okay to project this onto her. \n\nPlease don\u2019t invalidate her feelings either when she expresses that she doesn\u2019t like you calling him \u2018my little -\u2018. She\u2019s a new mom, it\u2019s stressful, it\u2019s a lot of work. \n\nYou\u2019re also NTA bc I think she may see the \u2018my little dude\u2019 comments in a completely wrong way. It does seem like she\u2019s a little bit possessive over him (not that it\u2019s a bad thing, it\u2019s their first child and every parent is always uber careful with their first). But to constantly tell you that you can\u2019t call him \u2018my little -\u2018 doesn\u2019t sit well with me. If anything, I see it as my son being so loved by his family and that\u2019s not a bad thing. My younger sister is my almost 2-year old\u2019s favourite and I\u2019m not bothered with whatever nicknames she decides to give him as long as they\u2019re not vulgar or rude. I know it\u2019s her way of showing she loves him by picking a nickname for him that she loves, like it\u2019s their own little thing. \n\nAt the same time, her feelings are valid even if it may seem a little off-sided. Perhaps you could explain to her what your intentions are behind calling him \u2018my little -\u2018. If anything, it really just seems to me like you really love him and I\u2019d be chuffed af as a parent to know that.", "NTA and a bit ESH in the way you both dragged this out. Look, after u have a kid ur personality changes , some moms are more strict and some more laid back so you have to give her some room to grow into her new role.", "Wow youre kinda weird for an inlaws nephew and not even YOUR nephew", "NTA but I understand why your sister wanted you to wash your hands etc especially if it\u2019s her first baby (new moms are nervous and deserve there own time and for germs and stuff to be away from baby I don\u2019t think those rules were worth being annoyed about) , it\u2019s her baby not yours. \n\nIn terms of the nickname your sister is being dramatic, she should love how much you love her kids and is going to regret not giving her child a village. I think the nickname is cute and your sister is being annoying. I would maybe stop using it, it\u2019s not worth the argument but I don\u2019t agree with your sister it\u2019s a cute nickname", "YTA. it is SUCH an easy thing to fix and you\u2019re just doing it at this point as a power play. She is right he is HER son. If you posting things with \u201cmy\u201d in the title then simply exclude that words. Jesus", "ESH. Everyone seems to be reacting way to strongly to everything here. Whether or not you're immediate family depends on your family. In my family, yes, first cousins and aunts and uncles would be considered immediate family too. But even so, parents still get to decide if they want some time before they have to deal with other people. And three weeks isn't that long, especially in a world of video calls. Post-covid, none of the sanitation things you noted are especially odd either, but I agree sometimes people approach way too intensely about it when you're not refusing anything they're asking for, which is AH-ish of them. Still, aside from that, everything here seems no more than a little irritating.\n\nNow on the topic of the MY issue. I get it, it really doesn't seem like that big of a deal. But on social media, people who aren't close enough to know who's who might very well start asking if you had a baby. And while it's an easy enough mistake to correct, I can see how that would be annoying, and even incite anger, to that child's mom. You could have easily made sure to make some reference to the fact that he was your nephew in future posts, to go with \"*the* coolest little dude\" instead of \"*my* cool little dude.\" So why the heck did you instead choose to try to \"blackmail\" your SIL about disappearing from your nephew's life because you couldn't refer to him as YOUR \"insert endearment\"? I feel like that was where you crossed into AH territory. Your SIL needs to chill out, but you're not blameless in this blow up.", "NTA she needs to get over whatever insecurity she has. Everyone knows its her chlid and your nephew. I always refer to my nieces as my big and my little princess, or My (name) and My (name). Even with my BFF, her sons are my little men or my boos. Kids can never have too much loving on them! \n\nNow I will say complaining about the mask and santizing, she was in the right there.", "The first thing she got mad about was you saying he was \"your\" favorite, yeah? And everything else has just escalated from that? She can't say you can't call him your favorite little man. That's stupid. (He also *is* your Owenator b/c that's the nickname you gave him.) I do understand her frustration at the others, b/c it is a sore spot with some moms.\n\nShe also can't get mad for you for wanting to back off b/c you chafe under her restrictions. She wants it both ways and that's not how it works. Yes, you could (and maybe should, but that's not my place to say) pull back with the mys about your nephew. It makes mom uncomfortable, and her feelings are valid.\n\nPersonally, b/c he is *your* nephew, *your* Owentor, and *your* favorite little guy, as well as *her* son, *her* baby, and *her* little man, I'm going with NTA, or N A H. That's just me though.\n\nYou may be a bit entitled about the baby, 3 weeks isn't that long, but that's not what's at question right now.", "YTA because it\u2019s clearly bothering her, and you continue to do it even after she has made several comments discouraging you from it.", "ESH", "YTA not because you called him your favourite the first time you posted a pic of him, but because his mom made it clear that she doesn't want you to refer to him as \"your little man\" or dude or whatever.  It's HER baby, not yours. She just gave birth, hormones are all over the place and you not respecting this one thing she asks of you is an AH move.\nAlso, she doesn't want you to cut contact like you threatened to do, she wants you to be his aunt. Just his aunt.", "Yep YTA massively.\n\nBoohoohoo you waited 3 weeks to meet him?? You're lucky. Some people don't allow meeting of the baby until their first shots at 2 months.\n\nWaah wahh wahhhh she made you wear a mask and made sure your hands were clean to try and prevent her newborn baby from getting sick?? Cry me a friggin river!.\n\n\nThe first time your sister made her comment you should have stopped. You didn't. You kept doing it even after knowing she doesn't like it. My dear, I cut my \"sister\" off for the same shit.(among others) Constantly calling my son her baby. Her cute boy. Her this her that. Even after knowing I hated it she continued. I finally snapped and told her that he's not her *anything* especially since she couldn't respect my very simply boundary of not referring to him as *hers*. I haven't spoken to her in 2 years and good friggin riddance. \n\nDon't make this season even more difficult for her by ignoring something she obviously feels strongly about.", "Nta.

YTA for being so incredibly disrespectful to your sister, and you are not entitled to time with your nephew.", "ESH maybe soft NTA. There are some parents that get defensive and territorial at the slightest thing. If you\u2019re not that involved and fawning over their kid, they get butthurt. If you give the kid a lot of attention, they\u2019re also butthurt. It\u2019s a no-win situation. At the end of the day it\u2019s not your kid. I think the sanest thing to do is not give this anymore attention. Don\u2019t make the posts and focus your energy on something else. Don\u2019t make this about you, don\u2019t make threats. Continuing to do so will only cause more nonsense. Sometimes you have to tap out.", "NTA - Yes immediate family means brothers, sisters, parents of both sets of parents for a baby. So just her side got to see him? Also it's a bit unhinged that she won't allow you to use the word MY. I mean, hell, I've used my little man for friend's children's that aren't even family.  If family is so important to her then she needs to layoff with the ridiculous rules.", "YTA\n\nFirst whining about having wait 3 weeks to meet a baby in the middle of cold/flu/RSV season and then being annoyed you had to mask and wash hands, not cool.  \n\nSecond, I get this is a sensitive topic since it sounds like you want to be a mom, but unless you are the parent, you don't call the kid \"my\" anything unless it is \"my nephew.\"\n\nNew moms go through a ton of emotional and physical changes.

Before my SIL gave birth her and i had sat down 2 weeks before and talked about the silly nick names to which we picked one and i said \"Okay this is offically what his nickname from his auntie will be!\" to which she replied with \" Oh my God thats adorable I love that!\" - the nickname is Owenator.\n\nFast Forward to when they came home afterwards that my SIL said that essentially all of us had to make an appointment in order to meet the baby. She told all of us that she wanted immediate family to meet him first. Now correct me if I'm wrong but I've always known that In Laws are considered \"immediate family\" well apparently we weren't. i didn't get to meet Owen until he was THREE WEEKS OLD. When I finally got to meet himshe made me wear a mask, wash my hands and use hand sanitizer before i could hold him. Again, he's 3 weeks old. While I was there my husband and I took pictures of him and us holding him, the usual. When we got home later I posted the pictures to fb and captioned it \"Got to meet my favorite little man today\" 20 minutes later my SIL commented saying \"You mean MY little man?\"\n\nSince then, any piictures I've taken of him or even with him and captioning it with things like: My lil dude, My little man, My little Owenator etc. well, whenever this happens she will comment on them saying : \"You mean MY little man (dude, etc\", her and I have had mutiple conversations about thisand how I can't call him anything that starts with \"My\". This has been happening since the day he was born.\n\nMy SIL had a conversation asking why I can't say it recently to which she responded with \"Because you haven't gone through sleepless nights, 2 days of labor, constant pain NOTHING\" now I should probably mention that I have a disease that makes it VERY hard for me to even get pregnant and I may not even be able to get pregnant. she continued to explode on me and I simply responded with \"Look, he's your child but he's also my nephew and if loving your son \"too much\" then count me out of his childhood.\" But of course, she spun around and started crying saying how family is so important to her and she want's me to be part of his life.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for using the word My infront of any term of endearment for my nephew?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I had zero issues with this as it\u2019s clearly not language used to denote ownership!! It\u2019s about expressing love and affection. So for that soap is NTA ans SIL needs to wind her neck in\n\nHowever o suspect t SIL is overwhelmed and exhausted so let\u2019s cut her some slack and respect what\u2019s she\u2019s asking instead of doubling down\n\nThreatening to go non contact and just generally continue if the drama as opposed to respecting SIL\u2019s wishes is a dick move and also the dummy throwing about waiting 3 weeks gives off entitled vibes.

You need to back the hell off. But not all the way out of the kids life ffs. Your capitalization of THREE WEEKS is literally shouting that you don\u2019t think boundaries apply to you. Of course she wants you to wear masks and wash your hands, you sound very put out by her having rules. Did you ask permission to post his pics on social media? Did you ask your sister what she is comfortable with? And will you please respect what she says and that it will change and evolve and she gets to decide that (consent is not permanent and unchanging). \n\nNow for her part, she sounds over the top with banning the use of my.

She is being short sighted if she wants to limit who is allowed to adore the kid.

Masks, hand sanitizer, etc\u2026 TOTALLY normal. Sorry you felt scolded, but maybe there was a reason she was so intense with you about this. \n5.

So just stop. \n7. Where is your sibling in all of this btw? \n\nRight now, the new parents make all the rules regarding the baby. As long as the baby is safe, that\u2019s ok. \nGo with the flow if you want to remain in your nephew\u2019s early life, and try to keep perspective.

I heard it after a week.\n\nI tried twice to be involved, but honestly: too many rules, apparently you don't want me there, I'm out. Wish you all the best but have my own life and family to run.\n\nSo I get where you are coming from.", "I would just refer to nephew as SIL\u2019s little man/little dude/owenator etc. for whatever reason your sil is very against any comment which may or may not imply that nephew is anyone else\u2019s son but hers so spell it out every time. She can\u2019t then get upset if she is mentioned as his mum every single time. So NTA for first time but knowing it upsets her why continue to do it", "NTA. The more people who genuinely love a kid, the better. It\u2019s exciting to have a niece/nephew/nibling and you were expressing your pride about having that. SIL is overreacting.", "NTA \n\nPeople on the sub are so out of it, it\u2019s funny. Calling someone \u201cMy favorite\u2026\u201d is not creepy,clingy, or showing ownership of something. \n\nIf anything your sil is kinda weird for it", "INFO: After her first objection to saying 'my', what made you decide to keep doing so? \n\nI don't really see her issue either. I tell me newphew he's my favourite little boy too, thankfully without issue. BUT she did gave a very clear sign that she didn't like it. To keep doing it is a choice that you know will annoy her. Which in turn can make things tense when it really didn't need to become tense.", "Nta in the slightest, and ignore the people saying otherwise. SIL is being very weird about literally words.", "Yea yta for doubling down and putting those captions lol. I have in-laws like you that since my son was born were always saying \u201cmy boy\u201d \u201cmy son\u201d etc etc and I never said anything like the mom here but god is it annoying af to listen to as a new sleep deprived mom", "YTA. Not for using \"my\", but for using it continuously after you could tell that it bothered your SIL. \n\nYes, she overreacted. But that doesn't make her feelings any less valid. If she would prefer you don't use it, don't use it. There are other ways to show love.", "Maybe this is an unpopular opinion; but NTA.", "ESH. SIL has every right to dictate terms on how people meet her kid. I know a kid who has a near miss with a cold sore from one family member so I get the masks etc.  We also asked the family to give us a week before we even let the grandparents in, so I get that too.   But she is really weird about the comments and to actually comment \"You mean MY little dude\", is properly odd.  My friend comments on pictures of my daughter calling her \"Her favourite gal\" etc and I find that endearing not possessive or weird.  You shouldn't have gone so hard on a new mum, so you suck a bit too. I almost went Not the Asshole but you do suck for the reaction, hence the judgement.  SIL really needs to chill out and accept the love for her son that is being offered unconditionally by a loving family.", "YTA - you continue to use \"My\" knowing it upsets the mom. It's not your child. When you met baby, or your fertility issues have nothing to do with it.\n\nRepeat it to yourself \"not your child, not your rules\". Wether you think mom is over the top or not is irrelevant. You're being an a-hole to a first time mom.", "Yes, YTA. You can take almost ALL of the detail out of this post and distill it down to: \u201cAITA for continuing to call my nephew something his mother doesn\u2019t like after she repeatedly asked me to stop and explained why I need to stop?\u201d\n\nYea. The deets don\u2019t make a lick of difference or yield a different answer. If anything, that you insist on doing this publicly over social media after being asked to stop makes it worse.", "NTA. I doubt anyone thinks you\u2019re claiming the kid as your own. The mother seems toxic. I would avoid.", "Nta", "Absolutely NOT the AH here. Your SIL is the AH for sure. She will be the over powering helicopter mom and unfortunately there isn't much you can do. Just wait till he is older and remind him hes STILL your little dude.", "NTA. All these y t a are unhinged.", "Unlike what I've seen down there I think you're NTA. Her behavior towards it is weird. That being said, if it's something that bothers her you should just stop. I don't believe you should be called a AH for anything that happened before you had that conversation but even if she has been a jerk during the conversation she clearly stated that she doesn't want you to do that so if you keep doing it, then you'll be the AH.", "NTA IMO sounds to me like mommy is a tad bit narcissistic. If my SIL called my kids that, I\u2019d be honored and would love it!", "The only thing I would say to the point of mom over reacting to the first statement is that we don\u2019t know if OP started pushing those boundaries before the birth. If she was saying stuff like \u201cwe\u2019re pregnant!\u201d Or \u201cthat\u2019s my boy in there\u201d or \u201cwhen my boy comes\u201d or \u201cwhat should we nickname my boy\u201d etc. I can see where 9months of that on top of \u201comg I can\u2019t see him for THREE WEEKS!?\u201d on top of not asking if she can post pictures on top of having to be reminded to mask and wash hands (the way mom asked leads me to believe she had gotten push back on it from previous visitors) ON TOP of being three weeks postpartum and over sensitive about EVERYTHING (I have 2kids, the hormones make one Sm\u00e9agol) all makes me think that maybe she didn\u2019t overreact at all. Maybe mom just got a bit defensive and is finally over it. \n\nNow I\u2019m grasping a little but it feels like, to me, it didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. OP should have just let it go and used \u201cThe Owinator!\u201d or something rather than pushing an already sore button. What I said about hormones making you possessive is 100% real. I handed my son to my own mom for the first time and wanted to throw up, snatch him back or scream in any order before I reminded myself that I wasn\u2019t a wild animal. It\u2019s tough.", "There\u2019s a HUGE difference between \u201cmy nephew\u201d and \u201cmy little man\u201d next to a picture of a baby\u2026", "My youngest nephew was born during covid and I didn't get to meet him until he was over a year old. And even now my brother and SIL only take their kids around vaccinated adults.", "I actually don't see the Y T A s all agreeing with the mom that \"my favourite\" is taking possession. Most of them are saying that a new mom who is probably still bleeding and in pain and hormonal and exhausted told OP to just stop calling her newborn something publicly, which really won't hurt OP by the way, and instead OP doubled down to spite on her.... then went all, it's \"my\" way or the high way. Well. I voted ESH.\n\nSome Redditors here are also saying that a mom has the right to decide what gets posted about her newborn on social media. It's one of those boundaries that you mightn't like but you have got to respect.", ">You do not say anything about someone\u2019s child on social media that they don\u2019t like. You do not use nickname\u2019s for someone\u2019s child that they don\u2019t like. You absolutely don\u2019t do it over and over and over again and make yourself completely exhausting to interact with. This is just gross, childish behaviour. \n\nHear, hear.", "Or it indicates that the behaviour that had let up to this was already grabby, abnormally, possessive and weird on OP\u2019s part. Considering that she had already been tantrumming about a perfectly normal delay before new parents are ready to host, and disobeying very basic safety precautions to the point of having to be repeatedly reminded *and clearly made a fuss about that too*\u2026 OP is very much not a reliable narrator of how weird she\u2019s acted about this child in the run up.\n\nIt is not uncommon for childless relatives with a lot of big feelings about not having their own baby to get overly grabby and possessive; hell some new mothers have to deal with it from their own parents or spouse\u2019s parents. OP fits the profile.", "Yup. My first thought was \u201cthree weeks? That\u2019s so early!\u201d", "There\u2019s a big difference between \u201c*my* baby\u201d and \u201cmy nephew\u201d or even \u201cmy brother\u2019s baby\u201d", "It really doesn't matter. OP was probably already annoyed at not being able to see her in-law's child for 3 weeks that they were just sensitive. I'm not sure how you can aggressively tell someone to wash their hands, but I really don't care if she was aggressive. That's her child.", "I called my little half sister my little mouse, or my sweetheart and her mother never said something against it even when other family or friends were around, because everyone knew that she was the mother and not me. She is 16 now and still call her my mouse sometimes and noone had/has an issue with.\n\nIt's wild to me that a mother gets mad at the baby's aunt just because she said my little man. \nThe aunt just shows affection, love and excitement about the little baby boy. \n\nIt would have been different, when she had said my little son, that would indeed be totally weird.", "I also wonder if OP perhaps started pushing these boundaries during the pregnancy. Calling her SIL\u2019s bump \u201cmy baby\u201d or \u201cmy boy\u201d or even \u201cour\u2026.\u201d I feel like this didn\u2019t just come out of the blue.", "These are not mutually exclusive statements. It is entirely possible that both need to chill. \n\nBut given one is a fresh, first time mum and the other is not, perhaps it would be advisable for OP to give SIL time *and* some patience?", "I definitaly got the same vibe. SIL was probably already wary of boundary pushing and OP inserting themselves into their baby's lives to an unwelcome extend.\n\nI think OP intentionally chose an innocuous example, to make SIL boundaries sound 'crazy' so she with our help could justify ignoring SIL boundaries and pushing her own agenda through.\n\nThe 'three weeks' in caps certainly indicates a sense of entitlement OP feels to this little boy.\n\nOP is framing it as an incident, while it sounds like SIL is reacting to a pattern.  \n\n\nOP doubling down on social media after being called out demonstrates this is not an isolated event.", "It's not late, but my siblings wanted us there the same day or the next. So I do understand it might feel late when your sibling has a child.", "She\u2019s a brand new sounds like first time mom. In the immediate aftermath of a first birth people do get sort of crazy.\n\nWhich is fair! They\u2019re trying to keep a brand new person alive and healthy with no experience and a lot of contradictory advice. They can get a little obsessed with doing things \u201cperfectly\u201d or get glued to a parenting philosophy that they haven\u2019t been able to test the boundaries/practicality of.\n\nProbably mom will chill out in a couple months when she has a better feel for her baby, the day to day of parenting, which things are actually important to her and which things are just stuff she had assumed would be important. \n\nThis seems like a situation where some patience and kid gloves would go a long way.", "THIS I agree with.", "Eh, nah. A person is responsible for all their actions. All of them. Including the actions they made while mad. Regardless of their emotions, what a person says and does absolutely affect other people.\n\nDon't judge people for being 'incredibly sensitive' if you're going to make an exception for people with anger issues.
