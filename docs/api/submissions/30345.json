You chose a concert over your sister. That's one of those forever things.", "YTA - you showed your priorities. You'd rather see Taylor Swift than attend a huge event in you family's lives. I mean, you even left your husband and kids there?\n\nI dont kniw what's more shocking, the fact you did it or that you still dont understand how disrespectful it is to a sister and family in general.", "You and your sister are both 28.  Is she your twin?  Oh and yeah YTA.", "[deleted]", "amazing what ppl are doing these days just to see taylor swift concert.", "YTA If you're old enough to have a husband and kids, you're old enough to not pull this kind of a stunt.  I feel bad for your husband for being left in the lurch and having to answer for your absense.", "Hell yeah YTA! What the hell is wrong with you to even think it was okay?", "YTA", "YTA- you left your husband and two YOUNG kids alone at your sisters wedding to see a concert. If it was that small of a wedding your absence was surely noticed. And why even mention the buffer style food? Is her wedding less important because of this detail?", "Is she your twin?", "YTA", "YTA without a doubt.", "Yta, I feel bad for your husband.", "I mean this all depends on your relationship with your sister and how close you are/want to be in the future. I know you say you aren\u2019t close but that can definitely mean a lot of different things. Ultimately, if this wasn\u2019t important to you than you should have just not gone at all. Either way, YTA to me. You keep making excuses for why it was fine for you to RSVP yes and then ditch for the dinner, but no matter how simple the buffet is you pay per person. \n\nYour parents are mad because it\u2019s a pretty bad look- you clearly didn\u2019t prioritize your sisters wedding which is hopefully a once in your life time event. Your husband is siding with them because he probably wasn\u2019t thrilled being left alone at a wedding for your family with a 3 and 5 year old explaining all night why you left.", "YTA. You\u2019ve created a lot of bad blood. Good luck shaking this off!", "Yes", "Everytime I see a Taylor Swift concert video with all the screaming hysterical masses I think, \"Half of these people have probably broken relationships and thrown away any and all family ties to be there\". \n\nYTA ofc. Majorly.", "YTA.", "YTA OP.  I mean, skipping your sister\u2019s wedding reception for a freaking Taylor Swift concert?!?  Not cool, and not sure if the relationship between you and your sister is going to be able to survive such a huge mistake.  I\u2019m not even confident that your MARRIAGE will escape unscathed.  I can understand if there was some sort of medical emergency, but Taylor Swift is not a medical emergency.", "YTA. You had a prior commitment to attend the entire wedding so you absolutely should have honoured that commitment instead of bailing to attend a stupid concert", "Soft yta bc I probably would've done the same thing but I wouldn't had my husband and children go to the wedding and stay for the entire event", "NTA. You went to the ceremony! And you weren\u2019t even asked to be in the bridal party. So nobody should be pulling the hypocritical \u201cbut it\u2019s your sister\u201d card. Skipping the exchange of vows would be disrespectful. Skipping eating pasta for a free ticket to the show of a lifetime is smart. \n\nMy daughter went to the show this summer. Sounded like it would have been a lot more fun than a reception lol.", "NTA- you were there for the ceremony. I understand your husband being upset but TS tickets are hard to get!", "Nta \n\nYou're not that close to her and you attended the actual wedding. Receptions are imo optional.", "NTA. The important part of a wedding is the ceremony and you attended that. You weren\u2019t in the wedding and you\u2019re not close so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an AH move to skip the reception. I do think it\u2019s odd that your husband and kids stayed though, why didn\u2019t they just leave as well? It probably would have been less noticeable if you all had left", "The most important part of the wedding is the ceremony. You were there. The rest is just a party. Your family will get over this. They'll get mad at someone else and forget about being mad at you, eventually.", "NTA - I mean, it\u2019s Taylor Swift! (S)", "I get it, if it was Beyonc\u00e9, Janet Jackson, Adele or *NSYNc hands down I won\u2019t be at a family event. \n\nBut my question to you, did you give your husband some sort of warning? Did you give your husband the option to leave with you and do something else with your children? If you didn\u2019t that\u2019s what makes you YTA, if you just sprung on your husband without a conversation.\n\nI\u2019m not one of the people who find family all that important. I\u2019m close to my mom, aunt and husband everyone else in my family I could do without. In my head you went to the wedding, you just missed reception.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
