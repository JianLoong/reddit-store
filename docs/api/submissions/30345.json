I only ask this, because I know women usually do most of the mental and household/child rearing responsibilities, so it's really nice to get out for self care and to maintain your identity and just have fun. \n\nIf you're not close to your sister, spoken with your husband prior (i.e. just left without telling him) and/or are taking this one night off to do something you want, NTA. And even if you split everything evenly with your husband in terms of responsibilities, I can still say NTA. I just know not everyone is close to their family... and that's ok.

Plus, considering all the extra interaction that went into this concert between fans, and exclusive merch, it\u2019s a tough call to make.\n\nThat being said, your sister has every right to feel hurt.

You\u2019re only human and it happens, but you need to try and make things right with your sibling first and then your family.

Her music makes them happy or helps them, great, but TS herself has no idea of this and acting like she\u2019d care if they weren\u2019t front and centre seems\u2026odd. I have musicians who I really respect and whose music has got me through tough times and if I met them id say thank you for that but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be this big deal for them since I\u2019m a total stranger! Swifties are kinda rabid. Not the regular fans, the obsessed ones.\n\nAnd I think Op is the AH for leaving her husband with two small children at the wedding while she bounced.
