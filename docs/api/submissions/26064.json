I have 2 adult sons at 21and 18 as well as 2 younger kids. If the adult kids don't want the same meal as the rest of us and create more dishes and mess then they can do their own dishes. If they eat with us, me or my partner deal with the dishes. I don't think it's a lot to ask of them to do some dishes if they make the mess themselves.", "NTA - if she wants to cook separately she should clean up after herself. Why is her mother teaching her to be entitled? Terrible parenting", "NTA. I was raised that if you make a mess, you clean it up, you don't get to go out and play while leaving your mess behind, it attracts flies, roaches and other vermin. If she claims adulthood, she needs to also act like one and clean up after herself. You and your wife need to sit down and talk about this together so you are a united front. Then you need have a talk with your adult child. But it is really important to be united and have a firm agreement with the wife first.", "NTA.\n\nI think you and her Mum need to start telling her that she needs to clean up before she leaves the house. Obviously at 18 she's an adult so it might be hard to enforce, but she needs to realise that she can't keep dodging out of cleaning by staying with friends for hours and hours.\n\nIt might be hard but I'd also persuade her partner to stop cleaning up for her. Yes it's annoying if the kitchen is left in a state that means it's hard for you to use, but at the very least I'd suggesting setting her unwashed dishes to one side and cleaning just enough counter space for you to use. Then when she gets home she's pointed at the dishes and the sink and told to wash up her things. After a few weeks of it she will hopefully start to realise you're not doing it for her any more.", "After years of telling me, begging, and bitching, my parents started charging me money for having to do my dishes/cleaning up after me.. \nAfter a week, my mom handed me a bill for \"Maid Duties\"\nI laughed the first time but the 2nd bill had non-payment/late fees for the 1st wee\nI starred doing my dishes and picking up after myself real quick.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
