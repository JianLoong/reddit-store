Last night around 11:30PM she said she would be going out out with friends after saying she wouldn't. She originally said she wouldn't because she has seizures. These have been happening on a daily basis now that I've been seeing her.\n\nBefore she went out she seemed very excited to say \" I might drunk text you\", getting this out around 2 or 3 times. Come 2AM I get a text saying \"can you help me\" followed by a call from her saying \"can you pick me up?\". I live around 20-25 minutes away from her.\n\nShe said she's on her own and all her friends have left and she's worried she'll have a seizure. Instead of getting an uber, she asked if I could pick her up. Being 2AM and I've only seen her 4 times... this is kind of a big thing to me. Not only that if I do come pick her up she'll now be under the impression that she can snap her fingers and I will come running.\n\nI asked her I can get you and Uber, it will be quicker for an Uber to come and for me to come get you. Which she responded with \"I can just walk\". After 10 minutes of me texting her and trying to call her to make sure she was safe. I get a call from her crying at her home. She said she was really drunk and alone and she just wanted a hug. Though I wanted to come over and comfort her, it didn't feel right.\n\nThen she started to say some fucked up shit. \"You don't like me, I'm obviously not the person you like and I hope you find that person\". This kind of pissed me off so I said \"thats unfair, I will call you tomorrow, you're drunk atm so I will check if you have the same feeling in when sober, I care about you.\"\n\nThe whole problem with all this is she didn't sound drunk and having a younger sister, I've gotten pretty good at identifying crocodile tears. I'm not saying these are true, but it could definitely be a possibility.\n\nWhilst writing this, she gave me a call to say how she didn't mean the stuff she said and she's just a little sad and anxious, which I supported her with. I still like her but I'm just really confused as to what is going on and if I handled the situation correctly.\n\nEdit: I should also note, a similar thing happened after we had 2 dates. She went out with friends, 100% got drunk and asked me to pick her up again. Which I said I couldn't because someone else was using my car.\n\nEdit: I think I should make a few things clear. She has not blamed me in anyway, she knows she's in the wrong, she asked for forgiveness. I was more wondering if the actions I took was asshole behavior and should I have actually came for her.", "created_utc": 1703328184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18p34ai/aita_for_not_picking_a_girl_up_after_a_night_out/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let me give you some sage advice as if you were my son: RUN. This girl's showing some major red flags and clearly doesn't have her shit together. I despise fakeness, playing games, wasting people's time and damsel-in-distress acts. I'm not necessarily saying ghost her either, but you definitely need to be careful. Your gut is right and this seems super manipulative to me, especially the part where she started saying the fucked up stuff. If this is her after only 4 dates, just imagine 4 months, 4 years.\n\nIf I were in her shoes at 2am, I'd cut ties with my old friends and find new ones who'd actually care enough about my safety to watch my back, and I'd be embarrassed AF to have to ask for help especially from someone I'm just starting to date. An Uber is a sensible request and actually probably safer if you live on the other side of town, as that would mean less time for her to be picked up and less time spent alone as a girl drunk in the dark and at risk of a seizure.\n\nShe also doesn't sound like someone who drinks responsibly at all. Alcohol can absolutely ruin a relationship. Sounds like she needs therapy, not you.", "NTA. She seems to be testing you in some way. I think you are quite correct in not wanting to be treated like a doormat, or her chauffeur, who can just snap her fingers and say \"home James\" and expect you to be there and do that. If she is afraid of getting seizures she should definitely not be getting drunk in the middle of the night or land herself in situations where her friends have left her behind somewhere. But it is wrong of her to try and make all this your problem.", "NTA- this girls having daily seizures yet still chooses to go out drinking? And with friends that leave her all alone?? \n\nHow old is she? Cuz if she\u2019s young 20s I can understand that behavior (not saying it\u2019s an excuse) but she clearly needs to grow up a little (and get her medical issue under control), and her issues are not your problem. I\u2019d end it tbh", "Bro, do you really want the mother if your kids to be this drunkard!", "YTA\n\nYou are an A to yourself. Get some standards and start applying them to yourself and those with whom you hang out.

I understand her side of wanting to go out even though she has a disability and I get why she doesn\u2019t want to get an uber as it could be dangerous, but you don\u2019t really know her, do you? You\u2019ve barely been dating and it just seems like her friends are unable to drive her around, so she\u2019s dating people who can cater to her needs, which is an a-hole move. It could be that she didn\u2019t mean to come off that way and that she really likes you and wants to spend time with you, but she\u2019s going about it wrong. Talk to her about how you feel and set boundaries, if she doesn\u2019t respect those in the future, she\u2019s not the one and you should just break it off.", "NTA and by the way you should be seeing a red flag fluttering in the wind.  Have you even witnessed one of the seizures?  It\u2019s all a bit too dramatic.", "don\u2019t date alcoholics bro", "INFO are you still dating this person or have you seen enough red flags to end it?", "There's some like her that it's a known Type of character, she is testing you and whatever problem is, it will be your fault soon enough.", "NTA. But seriously you obviously aren't I to super clingy needy relationships and that's obviously what this girl wants.  Just move on.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA", "NTA. You've dodged a bullet.", "She wanted you to come pick her up and do the deed. \n\nShe felt rejected. \n\nNAH", "100% agree! This reminds me of my younger behavior\u2026 which admittedly was not stellar. OP offered to pay for her Uber and she refused. She was just being difficult.", "So I\u2019ve also suffered from seizures- she is being irresponsible. She\u2019s having them basically every day (allegedly) yet still is risking going out drinking? With friends that leave her totally alone? \n\nI doubt she\u2019s not ubering because she thinks it\u2019s dangerous. She offered to walk home- that\u2019s arguably way more risky. I\u2019m a female in my 20s and use Uber by myself all the time. She probably just didn\u2019t want to pay for it or was trying to guilt op into getting her. Also, when you go out drinking you should either plan a ride home with a dd (that agrees to taking you home before you go out, not texting a guy you\u2019ve been out with less than 5 times) or expect an Uber.", "Umm, I don't wanna throw a spanner into the works but I think I actually am. The last girl I was with thought I was way too needy and broke things off.", "I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. My cousin suffered from seizures also and he had a hard time getting used to accommodate to his illness. \n\nI agree that she is being very irresponsible though, and as I said, it seems like she\u2019s just using OP for her own needs.", "Well then I think you might javelin found the one.", "For sure, she\u2019s been dealt a crappy hand but isn\u2019t handling it responsibly. Also op said this has also happened after their second date. So this is clearly a pattern for her. \n\nHonestly hats off to OP for turning down this very obvious booty call at least twice. But also I\u2019d just cut this relationship off, this girl needs to grow up", "This is quite a bit of drama after 4 dates. Take these red flags as hints and end it. NTA.", "I have epilepsy too, which is what she has if she\u2019s having seizures every day. We are all told to avoid alcohol as it can trigger seizures and for some medications it can increase side effects. Seizures are literally brain damage. I know she\u2019s 22 and probably feels invincible but the way she is treating herself is not ok. The drunk crying wanting a ride plus this makes a gigantic red flag. Some epileptics feel they\u2019ll never be able to get a partner because of their seizures but she\u2019s not taking care of herself and doesn\u2019t care she\u2019s getting brain damage. Do not stay and enable this behaviour.  \n  \nETA NTA", "Lmao just block and move on from this mess.", "She seems manipulative and she's playing games. You don't need that. NTA", "She sounds like bad news.", "Sounds like she just wanted a booty call and you turned it down. Rejection makes girls heads explode.", "NTA. \n\nI dated someone like this. It\u2019s textbook manipulation to make it all about you and then apologize later. It\u2019s also happened TWICE in 4 dates. What does that tell you is going to happen in the next 10 dates? People don\u2019t change overnight. \n\nUsually someone on the path to improvement will feel these emotions and explain they know they\u2019re being irrational without lashing out the way she did.", "NTA She's needy, irresponsible and manipulative.  Offering to call an Uber was super generous of you.  She is trouble. Stay away.", "Dude, you want a partner that is your equal, and mentally mature.\n\nThis girl is neither.  She is a walking red flag.\n\nShe has physical problems, mental problems, and alcohol problems.\n\nWalk away, and fine someone more compatible.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Run. Run far away.", "She also shouldn\u2019t be drinking so much if she has seizures - very irresponsible!", "Your first sentence had me dying \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 but\n\nYes yes yes, I agree with all of all the things. Take this advice OP", "I don't mean to be one of those \"these kids these days\" type of people but it would have been so much easier when I was young if uber was a thing.  She had solutions; this does sound manipulative as if she's testing him or exerting control (attempting to) over him.", "You are totally right. But as someone who has been a young insecure woman, I didn\u2019t realize how shitty I was until a nice man called me out appropriately and gently. It was what I really needed to start to fix my communication issues. Hopefully if op sticks around he can make clear his boundaries for this girl and she can actually listen.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Highly recommend op use condoms", "It 100% was a game changer. Especially cuz he offered to pay for it. If she really wanted to see him she would have taken an Uber to him. But she tried to make herself a martyr by walking home cuz he wouldn\u2019t get her. Which although it was stupid as a woman to walk alone that late, it was only 10 minutes. Also, if she was so worried about having a seizure walking home alone was incredibly reckless as well.", "As a former young insecure woman I second this sentiment, however it\u2019s also not on OP to have to stick around for her to mature. They should have a discussion sober and see if it\u2019s worth continuing, then if this behavior keeps happening he needs to end it. Also, that\u2019s saying if she\u2019s open to listening to him in the first place", "Very well said!", "Also adding that she probably keeps doing it because he keeps replying. Maybe she drunk texts him and picks fights for attention \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af"]}
