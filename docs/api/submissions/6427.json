Bringing all the Dad jokes to AITA...", "\ud83e\udd23", "My spouse takes a while in the bathroom too, but scheduling it to happen during your nice time out together when you\u2019re capable of not doing that is a dick move. It\u2019s brunch, do something to clear the pipes earlier in the morning so you can enjoy your espresso without your food getting cold and annoying your wife.", "I don\u2019t mean to be crude but if it routinely takes that long and you still insist on taking the brunch shit, you need to start waiting til you\u2019re prairie dogging it. Until you NEED to go, so it\u2019s a faster situation and you don\u2019t leave your wife to monitor your rapidly cooling breakfast for a ridiculous amount of time. I\u2019m gonna maintain NAH unless the brunch place of choice has single-person restrooms instead of stalls, if they\u2019re individuals YTA for sure.", "TEN MINUTE POOS WHILE AT BRUNCH?! YTA.", "TEN FUCKING MINUTES?\n\nAfter the third time I never would have gone to brunch with you again.\n\nYTA. It's so rude to go out to eat and then leave her alone to eat basically as soon as the food arrives.", "So, about 5x longer than you should ever leave your wife sitting alone at brunch. Shame on you.", "Info needed: So you just sit there vaulted over a steaming pile of your own poo for what...half an hour? and play chess on your phone? Or enjoy a long slow dangle?", "YTA. You value pooping over date time with your wife. She literally ranks lower than the toilet in your priorities. \nWhat an awful husband.", "Yup lost me here. Was fully ready to support you but 10 minutes is waaaay too long. Unless you can be in and out in 2-3 max that\u2019s too much.", "Damn. If it takes 10 minutes, did you even have to go?", "GTFOH! Ten minutes? No, if you have the urge, that means your rectum is full and it should not take you ten minutes to empty it. You claim to love your wife, but it sounds like you enjoy abandoning her to hang out on your phone and use poop as an excuse. YTA", "If it takes you 10 minutes to poop, you have more problems than just an angry wife.", "Yeah. YTA for routinely leaving your wife alone for ten minutes.", "Ohhhhhh mylanta.", "Holy hemorrhoids, Batman", "\ud83e\udd23 the drama here! NTA OP, it\u2019s a natural body function. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be downvoted galore but geez are people up in arms. You\u2019re entitled to enjoy a cappuccino and/or coffee on weekend brunch. Going pee takes at least 5 minutes, so it\u2019s not that weird to take 10. If I take my kids to the bathroom, it\u2019s at least 10 min.", "STOP IIIIIIIIT omg I snorted so hard it hurt \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "I like this suggestion.", "Once or twice? Fine. Every time they go to brunch he leaves her alone at the table for 10 minutes while he takes a dump? That\u2019s just being a crappy date.", "Exactly, sitting by yourself in a restaurant is not weird and why would people judge her sitting there by herself? It's just a weird insecurity people have. I have never once seen a person in a restaurant by themselves and thought \"what a loser, they are social  rejects and nobody loves them\"  grow up,go eat by yourself...it's great", "Decaf is an option", "Probably, because the BM doesn\u2019t really cause the bm. Seriously though, do your potties at home. You\u2019ve got a large brunch window of opportunity. Do your thing and then brunch and Bloody Mary\u2019s. Everyone is happy.", "How do you guys poop so quickly?!", "He probably just sits there scrolling at his phone and checking football scores\u2026 AH. Third time doing that i would have left him there on his own", "Every dad I know poops for 20-30 minutes multiple times a day", "Who takes 5 minutes to pee!!!!!", "If going pee takes 5 minutes, I would check with a doctor", "I think that, when you gotta go, you gotta go. But 10 minutes?! Unless you are at work, then ride that clock by all means.", "I was seriously thinking the same thing. How can a person be an asshole over having to go poop?!", "Haha I see what you did there! Crappy date \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "If they regularly go to the same brunch places then it\u2019s even worse because the servers probably realize he\u2019s always leaving to poop", "Maybe I'm looking at this all wrong, but I would think it would almost be the opposite. If dates (brunch, or otherwise) are rare, then I could see her being disappointed if he was gone for half of it. But it sounds like they spent A LOT of time together, and brunch is a very regular thing (maybe daily, even?). If that's the case, him being gone for 10 minutes seems like way less of a big deal to me.", "Thank you!!!! If  someone can\u2019t sit by themselves for 10 minutes imo that\u2019s an issue. This is so not a big deal", "Fiber bro. Fiber.", "How do you guys poop so *slowly*??", "Meanwhile, I always wonder how some people take so long (except in cases of illness/disabilities). I just wait until it\u2019s time and then I go. Why would I need more than 2 minutes? Do some people really have 10 minutes worth of shit to expel?! Kinda makes a fella wonder.\n\nWith that said I respect your right to drop monster dookies if you gotta", "Fiber like the other guy said, but hydration is also important.", "You have to get up, find the bathroom, find a clean stall, go pee, clean up, wash hands, and you think you\u2019re only taking 2 minutes? You need a watch! If you\u2019re a woman on her period, make it even longer!", "Peeing itself doesn\u2019t take 5 minutes but my dining partners will definitely be alone 5 min if I have to pee. I\u2019m not running to the bathroom and skipping hygiene", "Lol I mean, I can poop in under 2 minutes but my hubby takes at least 10-15. It seems like a weird thing to be mad at someone about. Would you get mad at a kid for taking 10 minutes on the toilet?", "Bless you, I\u2019ll be looking into supplements and foods with more fiber.", "Apparently a lack of fiber, or so I\u2019ve been told today. \n\n(Or maybe I\u2019m just underestimating how long 10 minutes is when you\u2019re pooping.)", "Most people have had a job at some point in their life that gives them 10 or 15 minute breaks. You bet your bottom dollar I time my pees when I'm on a time crunch like that. Absolutely no more than 3 minutes unless I'm intentionally dawdling.", "If there is no line, peeing takes 30 seconds (more or less) washing hands shouldn\u2019t take more then 30 seconds. Maybe in all 2 minutes. \n\nSide note\u2026 he doesn\u2019t have kids nor is a kid. And he knows it bothers her. He can skip the coffee or wait till after lunch to go to the bathroom.", "Would he take 10 to 15 minutes at a restaurant shortly after the food arrives every single time you go there? Because that is what we're talking about. And why even ask the question about the kid? Is the husband a kid and I missed it?", "\u2026 shit on company time.", "I know he doesn\u2019t have kids, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not rude that someone be left for 5-10 min because it happens all the time in the real world. If she has such a problem I would say divorce her because who the fuck tries to dictate how the other person regulates normal body functions?!? She\u2019s uncomfortable being alone? Grow up! He wants to enjoy his weekend brunch and had a normal body function.", "He doesn\u2019t but if he did, would I care? I have my food to enjoy. I can enjoy his company when he returns. Maybe I just don\u2019t care because I have 3 young kids and my meal is routinely interrupted. At least she can still enjoy her meal while he\u2019s in the bathroom. She should gain some perspective and grow up. He\u2019s not stopping her from enjoying the food at the restaurant. She sounds insecure and petty", "I would if I worked retail or something equally awful. Instead I work in childcare. If I take a bathroom break when I'm not already scheduled a break, it affects ratios and makes things harder for my coworkers. I still do if needed of course but I generally avoid it.", "But it's not just food. It's a whole brunch date experience.", "So if your friend goes to brunch with you, you want them to either forgo something they enjoy or not go to the bathroom because you might have to be alone for 10 minutes? If that\u2019s the case, she should divorce OP because she\u2019s that petty that she thinks she\u2019s more important than a normal body function. Anyone who can\u2019t spend 10 minutes alone is super insecure.", "No. But this is every single time. Again, I believe that you go when you have to, but 10 minutes right after the food has arrived every single time is egregious."]}
