How much does he work? Does he express appreciation to his mother for doing this?

Each of us are independent adults. None of us rely on the other to take care of our basic needs. \n\nSo we all cook for ourselves, clean our own spaces, do our own laundry, etc. \n\nHowever if I\u2019m going to the store I ask if anyone needs anything.

Snarky comments don't help much.", "When I lived at home as a teenager, I WANTED to do my own laundry because I wanted it done on my schedule, and I wanted to account for my own clothing items. My parents wouldn\u2019t let me because it was cheaper via water/gas/electric to have it all done together instead of separately. \n\nYou have no idea why his mom does his laundry for him. And it\u2019s kind of none of your business. It\u2019s idiotic for him to reject something his mother wants to help with because you might not like it. YTA.", "My teenagers are all perfectly capable of doing their own washing, but if I\u2019m already doing the wash and the job, why would I not just do everyone else\u2019s at the same time?

Maybe she got to it before he could do it?", "INFO\n\nDo you know how the laundry situation works? Is he for example working fulltime and its done at the household by someone at home? Does he pay rent?\n\nAs many others have said, don't jump to conclusions if you don't know. But from his words, this also doesn't sound like its a first either.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nHis mom wants to do his laundry, that's nice of her. Leave them alone.", "\"I think it's totally fine\" you say as you proceed to not think it's totally fine, if his response is any indication.\n\nI live with my parents still at 25, almost 26. Sometimes my mom does my laundry and sometimes she's nice enough to fold it. If my significant other saw this and told me it was \"fucked,\" I'd not only feel judged, I'd feel pissed that something nice my mom did for me was being made fun of.\n\nYou say he's been good about doing laundry and cleaning on trips you've taken -- at this point, it isn't about him not being responsible enough to do things for himself, it's about you wanting his mom to stop caring about him.\n\nETA: YTA.", "YTA. You don\u2019t know the situation if you don\u2019t live in the house. Maybe he always mows the lawn and she does all the household laundry. Maybe he does all the dishes. Maybe he pays her because he doesn\u2019t have time or dislikes doing it. My sister used to pay me to do her laundry when she was 28 and I was 16. Just assuming the situation means he\u2019s irresponsible may be discounting any number of things he is responsible for. Maybe instead of judging him you could be an adult and you know, ask? Or better yet, just let it be if it\u2019s working in their household and talk about it if it goes to the point where you\u2019re planning on moving in together.", "I mean, if it\u2019s her house chore to do everyone\u2019s laundry, why do you care?

Currently I live with my folks so I can save money after splitting from my ex - and guess what? My mum insists on doing my ironing. Won't let me near it. My dad insists on making me dinner and gets upset if I want something separate to eat. You can't stop parents being parents regardless of your age.

Where I come from if you live with your parents if your mum is doing the washing she will do everyone\u2019s. They just expect you to put it away yourself. If his mum doesn\u2019t have a problem with it why do you? It would only be a problem if you moved in together and he expected you to mother him. To be honest if I put a wash on and i have a partner I won\u2019t just put my stuff in either as long as it\u2019s not just me doing everything. He\u2019s her son whether he\u2019s 7 or 50 it doesn\u2019t make a difference to her.", "Maybe he wouldn't be made fun of if he actually did take some responsibility for himself?  NTA.\n\nOP, this is certainly potential red flag behaviour.  Supposing you and he lived together: would he still expect you to do menial tasks like folding his laundry too?", "NTA. But man I miss when my mom did my laundry. That was the good life.", "That feels like a male thing. I did my laundry from the age of 13 or basically when I started wearing women's clothes because women's clothes are flimsy and need to be washed in cold water and hung to dry, including women's underwear.\n\nIt never occurred to me until now but basically the family laundry was just my brothers and dad's clothes and my brothers probably never did a load of laundry because all their stuff was resistant. I mean all their clothes were like thick cotton shirts, thick jeans pants, shapeless underwear. Male clothes weren't form-fitting so they weren't made of stretchy thin material and they didn't need to retain their shape much since they were a loose fitting oversized style. But also the materials are just more durable.\n\nIt's kind of blowing my mind that they never had to think about it and their clothes just appeared folded in their drawers. It wasn't my mom doing it, my mom hired a cleaner to do it, but still I never had my clothes washed by the cleaner, and I know my mom didn't either, so essentially the cleaner was doing my brothers' and dad's laundry.\n\nI think my mom even installed in me the notion that I couldn't have the cleaner wash my clothes because women's clothing requires special instructions and we couldn't expect the cleaner to follow special instructions. That's how my mom lived her life so she transferred it to me since I was a girl.", "Don't move in with him until he has lived alone at least a year. NTA", "YTA your post didn't mentioned that his mother does EVERYTHING for him.i am sorry if your parents dont do enything for you even as an adult.

But sometimes it's one of my parents folds clothes and leaves them on my bed. We all chip in on chores as and when it's needed. My brother, on the other hand, doesn't do anything around the house.

However, after a bad break up I moved back home for a while and as I worked full time but she\u2019d recently retired at 60, she wanted to help me out so did my laundry again. She\u2019d also make meals for when I got back home. This was a lovely thing for a parent to do but it didn\u2019t mean that I was lazy or that I was coddled.

My mum did my laundry when I moved back home when I was 31. She was recently retired and had more spare time and it was lovely of her to do that. Didn\u2019t mean I was incapable and it didn\u2019t mean I was coddled. It was just a nice thing for family to do. Plus it makes sense doing washes all together like you say."]}
