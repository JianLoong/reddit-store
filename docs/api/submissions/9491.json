About a year ago, my brother (34M) reassured my son that he could be the ring bearer at his wedding. This conversation occurred after he heard us talking about mine and his dad's wedding and was very offended he wasn't invited despite the fact that wouldn't be conceived for another three years after the event. My son really latched onto this comment.\n\nNow, all these months later, my brother has proposed and is planning a wedding with his fianc\u00e9e. When I told my son that his uncle was getting married, he was obviously overjoyed and immediately launched into bragging to his younger brother (who wasn't born when the initial conversation took place and was just giving him typical baby babbles in return) that he got the be the 'ring bear.'\n\nI heard the proposal news from my mom and when I called to congratulate my brother, I also told him the story of how excited our oldest is. My brother went on to tell me that his fianc\u00e9e is pretty adamant about a child free wedding, so the promise he made might not be doable anymore.\n\nThis was obviously hard for me to hear. Not only would this break my son's heart, this would also make mine and my husband's lives considerably harder. We're currently living abroad and didn't think we would have to find childcare for the time of the wedding. Our only options now would be:\n\n1. Fly with our children and leave them in the care of people we don't fully trust since all trusted family members will be attending the ceremony\n\n2. Leave both children with a trusted friend near our home and fly to the wedding (not ideal since, thanks to flexible work schedules, we were planning to spend a month with our families following the wedding... flying in for the celebration, flying home to pick up our children, and then flying back is too exhausting. Them flying alone obviously isn't an option.)\n\n3. Not attend.\n\nMy brother said he would try to get his fianc\u00e9e to reconsider, but we spoke two nights ago and he said she's putting her foot down. Admittedly, I was hurt over this on my son's behalf. I told him we would still try to make it, but it was unlikely that we could. I also told him that if he even wanted us to consider coming, he would have to tell his nephew himself that he was going back on his promise and why.\n\nMy brother said it felt like I was issuing him an ultimatum and making him choose between family and his wife on what's supposed to be the happiest day of his life and that I was being unfair. I said he shouldn't have made promises he couldn't keep.\n\nAITA?\n\neta: Saw some confusion in the comments - I\u2019m a man.", "created_utc": 1675902948, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xg6kr/aita_for_insisting_my_brother_explain_to_his/", "score": 353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother made a promise that got child all hyped up, and now he wants someone else to deal with the emotional fallout when he renegs, because it would be inconvenient for him to deal with it himself? That's an asshole move right there.", "NTA\n\nYour brother put you into a difficult position (kids 101 don't promise them stuff cause they can forget it but they can also remember you t forever and it's 50-50).\n\nIf I were you, I'd skip their wedding. You and your husband can have a vows renewal ceremony instead, with two \"ring bears\", do something cute, invite friends and family that are close. Excuse yourself from brother's wedding explaining the situation to your family.", "NTA - from a logistical POV, seems like option 3 is the only one. Tell your brother you are not putting him in an ultimatum, his fiance did, you just can't be away from both your children for that long. \n\nChildfree weddings are a choice people can make, but they cant then be mad when people with kids dont come.", "I don't really think anyone's the asshole here. Child free weddings are very popular these days and it's not outlandish for her to not want kids there, it's her wedding too. It's the reality of becoming a parent that you won't be able to attend everything with your kids, and it's not your fault for wanting to. \n\nThere are more options of just attend with kids and don't attend at all though. You may not be the only ones who have littles who would like to go. Some venues will have on site childcare with an attendant. Maybe that's something that can be looked into. Or you could share a trusted babysitter with another attendee. \n\nTrying to pressure your brother into then pressuring his bride into changing her mind about the wedding is pretty low. You were absolutely issuing an ultimatum, or it felt like it to him. There very likely a bigger reason, or certain people, they would like to exclude from the wedding and child free is a way to make sure that happens. If they make a concession for you, they have to make them for other people.\n\nEdit: not many people make promises to a baby/ 5 year old expecting to keep them", "NTA if you decide to do childfree that's fine - it is your wedding but you also have to expect some parents won't be able to come due to childcare. And it is your brother's responsibility to tell your son why he will not be in the wedding, that's not an ultimatum it's called common courtesy. Honestly if your brother is paying for the wedding too he should have some say in it, but that's just me.", "NTA and if I were you I'd go with option #3. I know having a child-free wedding is the trendy thing to do (at least that's the impression I get from the amount of these posts - I'm a 50-year-old Canadian who has been to dozens of weddings and I had literally never been to a wedding that didn't have a single child in attendance, but I digress) but there doesn't seem to be a way to make it work. Honestly, if they really wanted you there they would let you bring the kids.", "NAH.  You are not wrong for wanting him to explain it, and he is not wrong for the change in plans.  This is actually a great opportunity for your son to start learning that sometimes plans change and things don't work out.  And that's it perfectly fine to be disappointed, but that unfortunately these things happen sometimes.", "NTA\nHe made the promise, he should be the little one to break it to his nephew.  (Or he can have his fiance do it.)  \n\nAnd I know that child free marriages seem to be more and more common, and this old man hates it.  A wedding is supposed to be a chance to share a special and life-changing moment with one's loved ones, friends and family.  Kids are a part of that.", "NTA: he made a promise he can\u2019t fulfil. He should be the one yo explain why.", "NAH.\n\nThe ring-bearer stuff aside, your brother doesn't seem to fully understand that you will be traveling from abroad and have to worry about childcare.  Leaving kids with complete strangers that you can't properly interview or check references on \\*because you live in another country\\* is a deal breaker.\n\nRegarding the ring-bearer stuff, your brother should be the one to let down your son.  He should never have made that promise to begin with (his future fianc\u00e9es may have wanted someone else to do that job)?\n\nIf your brother can't apologize, he would be an asshole.  If he does apologize, no assholes here \u2013 there are just logistics issues that make his wedding and your presence incompatible.", "NTA. If he really needs to have a 100% child-free wedding, he should be the one to shoulder the blame and explain to your son that he can\u2019t attend.", "NAH. The fiancee probably has her reasons. The brother shouldn't be held to a promise he made before he ever planned to get married. Ultimately, it's their affair and their decision.\n\nYou are of course free to try to convince/cajole them into agreement, that doesn't make you an asshole as long as you don't fly off the handle at them.\n\nAs for whether you can attend or not, that's up to you. Choosing not to attend for child care reasons doesn't make you an asshole either. Brother & fiancee knew that decision would preclude attendance by many people, and they seem OK with it.", "NTA. Your brother said it to your son, now he should explain why he changed his mind. As far as attending his wedding, he and his bride have made their choice to be child free. Now you and your spouse have to make yours on whether or not you'll be able to attend with the travel and child care issues. If you don't, your brother has no right to be upset about it.", "NTA, he's put you in such a difficult position. Not just with the promise to your son but also for you to attend the wedding. I personally wouldn't attend since there are no proper childcare solutions.", "You shouldn't attend.  To avoid being TA, just apologize for not being able to be there.", "NTA, he made a promise and now he wants to break it. The absolute least he could do is own his mistake and explain it to his nephew.", "NTA. Whether you go or not (if it were me I wouldn\u2019t bother since it\u2019s too difficult to arrange) your brother still needs to explain to his nephew why he\u2019s breaking his word. He probably shouldn\u2019t have made that promise to begin with but he still needs to make things right.", "NTA, possible compromise though, see if your brother's fiance will agree to a child free reception, this way your son can be ring bearer but they'll still be able to get the benefits of child free in the reception.", "NTA if this was like you can\u2019t got because of the location I would say yea but your priority are your children and if you can\u2019t go you can\u2019t. I think your son won\u2019t blame you but you will definitely be getting the blunt of bitterness from your son. Goodluck", "NTA \n\nRule number one with kids is \u201cpromise something, then follow through\u201d. Good or bad. It creates a place where kids can trust the adults around them", " NTA. Perhaps your brother should \u201cput his foot down\u201d as well and tell his fianc\u00e9 to get over it. He made a promise and should keep it.", "I\u2019m all about childfree weddings (I had one myself) but NTA. Your brother made your son a promise he can\u2019t keep\u2014but only if you actually do attend if he does. \n\nIf he speaks to your son and then you decline anyway, then YWBTA.", "NTA. When people choose to exclude family members from their weddings, they have to be willing to graciously accept it when people decline to come. It should have been a foregone conclusion that no one with children would fly in for a wedding if their children were not invited as arranging childcare in another city is usually not possible. Your brother was beyond foolish to make promises to his nephew and absolutely owes him a conversation to explain why he is changing his mind now.", "ESH. You brother shouldn't have made this promise to his nephew only to renege on it without putting much fight into it. Kids remember these kinds of things, and your son for sure will be sad about this.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are kind of using this as an excuse to lean on your brother. This is his wedding, he can do whatever he wants. It's now your choice on whether to go or not to go. It's not his job to tell your son about this broken promise. You know why? Because you are the parent. \n\nUse this opportunity to do something fun with your kids and play on the \"ring bear\" expression he uses. He'll forget all about his uncle's promise in no time.", "You\u2019ve made it clear in the comments that you wouldn\u2019t even consider option 1 of flying with your kids and leaving them with a babysitter you don\u2019t know very well. \n\nIt seems pretty obvious that option 2 is ridiculous cause no reasonable person would leave their kids with a friend for a month while they were in another country.\n\nWhich means the only *actually* viable option is 3: don\u2019t attend. I think you knew that before posting this, but more importantly I think you knew that before you gave your brother that ultimatum, but you felt guilty about it so you wanted a way to push the \u201cblame\u201d (in quotes cause I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to skip the wedding if you don\u2019t have childcare options) onto someone else. You\u2019re not an AH if you don\u2019t attend YTA for doing this and then coming on here to get validation for your choices.", "A offhand promise he made to your kid when he was 3-4 years old. I doubt your child remembered til you brought it up. It sucks, but your child will get over it. Plans change all the time and it\u2019s best you deal with it at this age than someone else. Please don\u2019t turn this minor thing into a wedge between your family.", "NTA.  He made a promise, he should be the one to explain to his nephew why he's suddenly unwanted.  Everyone's trying to guilt you about your relationship with your brother, yet your brother apparently isn't required to do anything to maintain his relationship with his nephew?  Reddit is really gross about treating the feelings of children as unimportant.", "YTA - it\u2019s pretty clear that the issue is that you\u2019ll have to find alternative child care for the wedding, not the ring bearing promise. There are many reputable childcare providers. You could also see if there is an Adventure Kids - I loved when my mom would let me play there growing up. \n\nIt\u2019s cute that your brother made a promise to your (at the time) 4 year old son. But this was over a year ago\u2026 He\u2019s five - if you stop bringing up the wedding I\u2019m positive your kid will forget about the promise. Trust me, this is not worth potentially ruining your relationship with your brother over. \n\nAlso, if it\u2019s really such a big deal to you that your son is the ring bearer, just suggest doing a cute little ring bearing ceremony in your vacation house around their one month anniversary. All your family will still be in town. I honestly think it could be a sweet activity where your kids can give your SIL and brother they rings and they could say their vows. It\u2019s not like your kid will know it isn\u2019t the real wedding\u2026", "Not an AH for being disappointed, but YTA for using your kid as a pawn like this.  You're mad that his wedding will be difficult to turn into the month-long trip you anticipated and are trying to inflict some form of punishment on your brother. Your son is five.  You can make up a separate \"ring bear\" ceremony and he won't know the difference. You also have other options, like still going to visit family for the month but skipping out on the child-free ceremony, or perhaps your husband could watch the kids during the ceremony while you go.", "Soft on NTA.  Your brother made a promise to your child and he also knows you have to travel with children.  Why is everything about what the bride wants? Does the groom get no say?  He said she put her foot down.  Well buddy, get use to that foot.", "NTA - This is the first I've heard of a child free wedding when close family members have kids.  If I were you I would not attend.   When asked why, I'd say it's a child free wedding and I'm not child free.  \n\nIf he tries to negotiate some solution where you dump your kids somewhere a few days I'd just respond that that's not how parenting works.   It's not like dropping off dogs at a kennel, and that he'll understand when he's a parent.", "YTA \n\nYou're making your brothers engagement news and wedding all about you and your son. You should be congratulating him and his fianc\u00e9. Letting them tell you about the proposal and wedding plans and letting them enjoy their moment. \n\nHave a mock wedding at home with your husband get all dressed up, have a \"fancy\" dinner at home  and let your son be the ring bear and have his fun so he can get it out of his system. Take lots of photos and let this be a core memory for him. \n\nYou gave 3 options cool here's a few more:\n\n1. You and your husband fly over with the kids, your husband skips the wedding. \n2. You fly in attend the wedding your husband comes with the kids later on. \n3. You get a room at the the hotel/wedding location hire a sitter referred to you by friends/family and check in on the kids occasionally.\n4. You and your family fly in with a trusted friend/sitter they stay for a few days (at your expense) to watch the kids and you can have your fun adult time knowing your kids are in trusted hands. \n\nImagine how you would feel if someone made your engagement/wedding all about them.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  It is cute about your son dreaming of being a ring bearer before he was conceived and calling it \u201cbear\u201d instead of barer.  All cute.  It sounds like your brother hadn\u2019t proposed at the time, did not have a fianc\u00e9 or a wedding at the time and made a comment offhand in response to hearing your son said he wanted to have been the ring bearer at his parents\u2019 wedding.  It is fine for your child to be disappointed.\n\nPeople are within their rights to have child free weddings and it isn\u2019t a personal affront to those with children or those for whom childcare arrangements are complicated.  It is unfortunate to live abroad when a loved one is getting married or to be working out challenges to being able to attend.  People are also allowed to settle on the specific plans for their weddings after the actual engagement. \n\nIt is fine to ask, *ask* your brother if he would be the person to let your son down.  In this situation I don\u2019t think it is a good idea to threaten or guilt your brother.  \n\nI\u2019m a kindergarten teacher.  Part of growing up and getting bigger is handling disappointment.  I think you should manage yours then work on helping your son manage his.  Something about the tone of your post also makes me wonder if it\u2019s possible that in fact this is a bigger deal to you than it is to your son.  It probably was a bad idea to confirm to your son that he was the ring bearer before checking in with your brother to his specific plan.", "Why can\u2019t you take your children and then have a babysitter for the day of the wedding? Then you can all stay for the entire month like you planned.  \n\nI think it\u2019s fine to have your brother explain to your son, but if he doesn\u2019t then you should. Whoever explains just needs to tell your son that they are having a grownup only wedding, so there isn\u2019t going to be a ring bearer (I think in this situation the best man just hands groom the ring). He\u2019ll be disappointed but plans change and hopefully your brother will learn not to make big promises like that.", "I kind of think you\u2019re being a dramatic YTA. Your son will recover emotionally from not being the ring bearer and you will be able to find child care for the wedding just fine. What won\u2019t recover is your relationship with your sibling.", "I would say lightly YTA. Although I understand keeping a promise may be important to you, I think you need to understand that in life things change, and don't always go your way. I think this is an important lesson for your son (especially when you mention how much he is gloating and bragging about it to other people). Your brother had the best intentions BEFORE he got engaged and likely did not know his finance would not want children at the wedding. I think your brother, your son and you should sit down and talk about this. Be honest with him in saying that your brother hoped he would be the ring bearer but somethings things change and we have to work it out.  Your brother can make it up to your son in the future, but still respect your brothers wishes to be child free at his wedding.", "YTA. This happened to me as a kid, when I was 6 years old. Invited to be the flower girl in a cousin\u2019s wedding pre-engagement. Plans changed, no more big ceremony, no need for a flower girl. Do you know who explained it? My mom. Not my cousin. She told me plans had changed. Disappointing but not something that turned into crippling despair for six-year old me. \n\nAnd decades later, I\u2019m fine. No lasting emotional trauma. No inability to see flowers without breaking into sobs  over my missed opportunity to be awwwed at. No lasting anger at my cousin. \n\nStop being a prick.

No wonder they don\u2019t want them at the wedding.", "Option 4, you go, husband and kids stay home", "NTA. \n1) He made a promise, he needs to suffer the consequences of breaking that promise. \n2) He and his fianc\u00e9 must understand the logistics of you and your husband traveling to a different country with two small kids to this wedding.", "YTA. Go visit your family. Bring your kids. Your husband doesn\u2019t have to go to the wedding if it is such a big fucking deal to have a babysitter. Your son literally doesn\u2019t know what the fuck a wedding is or what a ring bearer even is so just ask your brother and his fianc\u00e9 if they\u2019d be open to you throwing a little celebration dinner where you do a little ceremony where she gives her son her engagement ring and asks him to put it at her plate for her so it\u2019s safe for the dinner. Bam, ring bearer role complete, your entire family celebrates your brother\u2019s wedding, you all spend a month with your family and all with the added bonus that you stop acting like your son is the center of the universe.", "All the Y t A votes about the kid getting over it when you know darn well if this were a bridesmaid suddenly being uninvited or taken out of the wedding party they'd be upset as hell.  But a kid is supposed to just get over it, and his dad's are supposed to not be upset about his heartbreak.  Ridiculous.

Every situation is different, but in most cases you're just an asshole for having a child free wedding. People want a wedding they can't afford, and so they reduce the guest list by cutting out children. Don't give me some crock of shit about how you want an adults only experience - weddings are almost universally a family event.\n\nIt causes all of these conflicts because it's heartless and shameful. Your brother doesn't want to talk to his nephew because he's embarrassed by his decision. Perhaps his inability to take ownership of the decision is a pretty good indicator that he's an asshole for making it in the first place.", "Info: What about inviting a friend to travel with you to the wedding but stay at the hotel with the kids?", "YTA.  Obviously he made a promise without discussing it with his fianc\u00e9.  While it was incredibly stupid of him to do, you state can\u2019t afford or manage child care anyways, so the obvious thing to say is, \u201cwe won\u2019t be going to wedding because it costs too much for us.\u201d  Both you and your son need to learn things don\u2019t always go as planned and sometimes they change.", "YTA\n\nYou are doing this just to be an ass.

It would be easy enough to tell him being the ring bearer is a terrible job, and then get him excited about seeing his relatives.\n\nAdditionally, some local family and friends likely have children and use babysitters. Piggyback off of them, and viola, you've solved your childcare issue for the evening.\n\nAll you're going to accomplish with this is making your brother think you're a massive jackass he doesn't want there, while losing control of the narrative. He could tell your kid *anything* and he'll be seriously pissed at *you* in that moment. I can see you saying something snarky before handing over the phone, and him being done and telling your kid he doesn't get to be a ring bearer because his daddy is no longer invited. \n\nEither go and be completely happy and supportive... or don't go. Because at this point, with this attitude, you'd just be ruining his wedding if you went, and you'd be unpleasant company during that month after. So just don't go.", "ESH.

The bride usually has a lot of input in these things and  frankly,  you spent a lot of effort saying why childcare was the real problem.

About a year ago, my brother (34M) reassured my son that he could be the ring bearer at his wedding. This conversation occurred after he heard us talking about mine and his dad's wedding and was very offended he wasn't invited despite the fact that wouldn't be conceived for another three years after the event. My son really latched onto this comment.\n\nNow, all these months later, my brother has proposed and is planning a wedding with his fianc\u00e9e. When I told my son that his uncle was getting married, he was obviously overjoyed and immediately launched into bragging to his younger brother (who wasn't born when the initial conversation took place and was just giving him typical baby babbles in return) that he got the be the 'ring bear.'\n\nI heard the proposal news from my mom and when I called to congratulate my brother, I also told him the story of how excited our oldest is. My brother went on to tell me that his fianc\u00e9e is pretty adamant about a child free wedding, so the promise he made might not be doable anymore.\n\nThis was obviously hard for me to hear. Not only would this break my son's heart, this would also make mine and my husband's lives considerably harder. We're currently living abroad and didn't think we would have to find childcare for the time of the wedding. Our only options now would be:\n\n1. Fly to the wedding and leave our children in the care of people we don't fully trust since all trusted family members will be attending the ceremony\n\n2. Leave both children with a trusted friend near our home and fly to the wedding (not ideal since, thanks to flexible work schedules, we were planning to spend a month with our families following the wedding... flying in for the celebration, flying home to pick up our children, and then flying back is too exhausting. Them flying alone obviously isn't an option.)\n\n3. Not attend.\n\nMy brother said he would try to get his fianc\u00e9e to reconsider, but we spoke two nights ago and he said she's putting her foot down. Admittedly, I was hurt over this on my son's behalf. I told him we would still try to make it, but it was unlikely that we could. I also told him that if he even wanted us to consider coming, he would have to tell his nephew himself that he was going back on his promise and why.\n\nMy brother said it felt like I was issuing him an ultimatum and making him choose between family and his wife on what's supposed to be the happiest day of his life and that I was being unfair. I said he shouldn't have made promises he couldn't keep.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s her wedding, too, and if that\u2019s what she wants, then that\u2019s what she wants.  \n\nI would take it as a learning opportunity for your son to explain that plans change and that\u2019s life.

If you keep harping on him to change his mind, or start getting more people involved, you will become an ah.\n\nI don't think your brother is an ah because it's not just his wedding, it is also his fianc\u00e9e's wedding.

Also he should probably normalize that this wedding will never be the happiest day of his life and it isn't most of married couples, when asked at their 10 year anniversary what their happiest day was.

Maybe you could even compromise to let the kids attend the ceremony and then the sitter could take them back to wherever you'd be staying so if your brother would go for it.

It's his wedding too. If he wants his nephew as the ring bearer- she needs to accept that. I hate that's he's deflected blame on to her.

If you are unable to go because of distance that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole but you seem very entitled and the fact that you want to punish your brother and upset your son in the process for this is also extreme and overdramatic. I would just rsvp no you can\u2019t come and call it a day.

We had four flower girls and two ring bearers, and there were at least 15 kids there. The kids danced all night. The oldest of my flower girls and ring bearers are graduating from high school this year. Them being in my wedding and all the kids being there is truly one of my favorite parts of my wedding.

The brother was presumably already dating and fairly serious with his fiance, so the wedding was a near future thing, not something that wasn't even on his radar as a real event yet.  And it does not sound at all like the uncle vaguely agreed to something while half listening.  Kiddo was upset, and the uncle took the initiative to tell his nephew he would be the ring bearer, a role he was clearly very excited about.  So, if a friend or close family member who was seriously dating someone talked to you about being in their wedding party then a year later decided to not even invite you to the wedding because their significant other doesn't like you, would you be modeling \"grace and resiliency\"?
