About a year ago, my brother (34M) reassured my son that he could be the ring bearer at his wedding. This conversation occurred after he heard us talking about mine and his dad's wedding and was very offended he wasn't invited despite the fact that wouldn't be conceived for another three years after the event. My son really latched onto this comment.\n\nNow, all these months later, my brother has proposed and is planning a wedding with his fianc\u00e9e. When I told my son that his uncle was getting married, he was obviously overjoyed and immediately launched into bragging to his younger brother (who wasn't born when the initial conversation took place and was just giving him typical baby babbles in return) that he got the be the 'ring bear.'\n\nI heard the proposal news from my mom and when I called to congratulate my brother, I also told him the story of how excited our oldest is. My brother went on to tell me that his fianc\u00e9e is pretty adamant about a child free wedding, so the promise he made might not be doable anymore.\n\nThis was obviously hard for me to hear. Not only would this break my son's heart, this would also make mine and my husband's lives considerably harder. We're currently living abroad and didn't think we would have to find childcare for the time of the wedding. Our only options now would be:\n\n1. Fly with our children and leave them in the care of people we don't fully trust since all trusted family members will be attending the ceremony\n\n2. Leave both children with a trusted friend near our home and fly to the wedding (not ideal since, thanks to flexible work schedules, we were planning to spend a month with our families following the wedding... flying in for the celebration, flying home to pick up our children, and then flying back is too exhausting. Them flying alone obviously isn't an option.)\n\n3. Not attend.\n\nMy brother said he would try to get his fianc\u00e9e to reconsider, but we spoke two nights ago and he said she's putting her foot down. Admittedly, I was hurt over this on my son's behalf. I told him we would still try to make it, but it was unlikely that we could. I also told him that if he even wanted us to consider coming, he would have to tell his nephew himself that he was going back on his promise and why.\n\nMy brother said it felt like I was issuing him an ultimatum and making him choose between family and his wife on what's supposed to be the happiest day of his life and that I was being unfair. I said he shouldn't have made promises he couldn't keep.\n\nAITA?\n\neta: Saw some confusion in the comments - I\u2019m a man.", "created_utc": 1675902948, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xg6kr/aita_for_insisting_my_brother_explain_to_his/", "score": 8560, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother made a promise that got child all hyped up, and now he wants someone else to deal with the emotional fallout when he renegs, because it would be inconvenient for him to deal with it himself? That's an asshole move right there.", "NTA\n\nYour brother put you into a difficult position (kids 101 don't promise them stuff cause they can forget it but they can also remember you t forever and it's 50-50).\n\nIf I were you, I'd skip their wedding. You and your husband can have a vows renewal ceremony instead, with two \"ring bears\", do something cute, invite friends and family that are close. Excuse yourself from brother's wedding explaining the situation to your family.", "NTA - from a logistical POV, seems like option 3 is the only one. Tell your brother you are not putting him in an ultimatum, his fiance did, you just can't be away from both your children for that long. \n\nChildfree weddings are a choice people can make, but they cant then be mad when people with kids dont come.", "I don't really think anyone's the asshole here. Child free weddings are very popular these days and it's not outlandish for her to not want kids there, it's her wedding too. It's the reality of becoming a parent that you won't be able to attend everything with your kids, and it's not your fault for wanting to. \n\nThere are more options of just attend with kids and don't attend at all though. You may not be the only ones who have littles who would like to go. Some venues will have on site childcare with an attendant. Maybe that's something that can be looked into. Or you could share a trusted babysitter with another attendee. \n\nTrying to pressure your brother into then pressuring his bride into changing her mind about the wedding is pretty low. You were absolutely issuing an ultimatum, or it felt like it to him. There very likely a bigger reason, or certain people, they would like to exclude from the wedding and child free is a way to make sure that happens. If they make a concession for you, they have to make them for other people.\n\nEdit: not many people make promises to a baby/ 5 year old expecting to keep them", "NTA if you decide to do childfree that's fine - it is your wedding but you also have to expect some parents won't be able to come due to childcare. And it is your brother's responsibility to tell your son why he will not be in the wedding, that's not an ultimatum it's called common courtesy. Honestly if your brother is paying for the wedding too he should have some say in it, but that's just me.", "NTA and if I were you I'd go with option #3. I know having a child-free wedding is the trendy thing to do (at least that's the impression I get from the amount of these posts - I'm a 50-year-old Canadian who has been to dozens of weddings and I had literally never been to a wedding that didn't have a single child in attendance, but I digress) but there doesn't seem to be a way to make it work. Honestly, if they really wanted you there they would let you bring the kids.", "NAH.  You are not wrong for wanting him to explain it, and he is not wrong for the change in plans.  This is actually a great opportunity for your son to start learning that sometimes plans change and things don't work out.  And that's it perfectly fine to be disappointed, but that unfortunately these things happen sometimes.", "NTA\nHe made the promise, he should be the little one to break it to his nephew.  (Or he can have his fiance do it.)  \n\nAnd I know that child free marriages seem to be more and more common, and this old man hates it.  A wedding is supposed to be a chance to share a special and life-changing moment with one's loved ones, friends and family.  Kids are a part of that.", "NTA: he made a promise he can\u2019t fulfil. He should be the one yo explain why.", "NAH.\n\nThe ring-bearer stuff aside, your brother doesn't seem to fully understand that you will be traveling from abroad and have to worry about childcare.  Leaving kids with complete strangers that you can't properly interview or check references on \\*because you live in another country\\* is a deal breaker.\n\nRegarding the ring-bearer stuff, your brother should be the one to let down your son.  He should never have made that promise to begin with (his future fianc\u00e9es may have wanted someone else to do that job)?\n\nIf your brother can't apologize, he would be an asshole.  If he does apologize, no assholes here \u2013 there are just logistics issues that make his wedding and your presence incompatible.", "NTA. If he really needs to have a 100% child-free wedding, he should be the one to shoulder the blame and explain to your son that he can\u2019t attend.", "NAH. The fiancee probably has her reasons. The brother shouldn't be held to a promise he made before he ever planned to get married. Ultimately, it's their affair and their decision.\n\nYou are of course free to try to convince/cajole them into agreement, that doesn't make you an asshole as long as you don't fly off the handle at them.\n\nAs for whether you can attend or not, that's up to you. Choosing not to attend for child care reasons doesn't make you an asshole either. Brother & fiancee knew that decision would preclude attendance by many people, and they seem OK with it.", "NTA. Your brother said it to your son, now he should explain why he changed his mind. As far as attending his wedding, he and his bride have made their choice to be child free. Now you and your spouse have to make yours on whether or not you'll be able to attend with the travel and child care issues. If you don't, your brother has no right to be upset about it.", "NTA, he's put you in such a difficult position. Not just with the promise to your son but also for you to attend the wedding. I personally wouldn't attend since there are no proper childcare solutions.", "You shouldn't attend.  To avoid being TA, just apologize for not being able to be there.", "NTA, he made a promise and now he wants to break it. The absolute least he could do is own his mistake and explain it to his nephew.", "NTA. Whether you go or not (if it were me I wouldn\u2019t bother since it\u2019s too difficult to arrange) your brother still needs to explain to his nephew why he\u2019s breaking his word. He probably shouldn\u2019t have made that promise to begin with but he still needs to make things right.", "NTA, possible compromise though, see if your brother's fiance will agree to a child free reception, this way your son can be ring bearer but they'll still be able to get the benefits of child free in the reception.", "NTA if this was like you can\u2019t got because of the location I would say yea but your priority are your children and if you can\u2019t go you can\u2019t. I think your son won\u2019t blame you but you will definitely be getting the blunt of bitterness from your son. Goodluck", "NTA \n\nRule number one with kids is \u201cpromise something, then follow through\u201d. Good or bad. It creates a place where kids can trust the adults around them", " NTA. Perhaps your brother should \u201cput his foot down\u201d as well and tell his fianc\u00e9 to get over it. He made a promise and should keep it.", "I\u2019m all about childfree weddings (I had one myself) but NTA. Your brother made your son a promise he can\u2019t keep\u2014but only if you actually do attend if he does. \n\nIf he speaks to your son and then you decline anyway, then YWBTA.", "NTA. When people choose to exclude family members from their weddings, they have to be willing to graciously accept it when people decline to come. It should have been a foregone conclusion that no one with children would fly in for a wedding if their children were not invited as arranging childcare in another city is usually not possible. Your brother was beyond foolish to make promises to his nephew and absolutely owes him a conversation to explain why he is changing his mind now.", "ESH. You brother shouldn't have made this promise to his nephew only to renege on it without putting much fight into it. Kids remember these kinds of things, and your son for sure will be sad about this.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are kind of using this as an excuse to lean on your brother. This is his wedding, he can do whatever he wants. It's now your choice on whether to go or not to go. It's not his job to tell your son about this broken promise. You know why? Because you are the parent. \n\nUse this opportunity to do something fun with your kids and play on the \"ring bear\" expression he uses. He'll forget all about his uncle's promise in no time.", "You\u2019ve made it clear in the comments that you wouldn\u2019t even consider option 1 of flying with your kids and leaving them with a babysitter you don\u2019t know very well. \n\nIt seems pretty obvious that option 2 is ridiculous cause no reasonable person would leave their kids with a friend for a month while they were in another country.\n\nWhich means the only *actually* viable option is 3: don\u2019t attend. I think you knew that before posting this, but more importantly I think you knew that before you gave your brother that ultimatum, but you felt guilty about it so you wanted a way to push the \u201cblame\u201d (in quotes cause I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to skip the wedding if you don\u2019t have childcare options) onto someone else. You\u2019re not an AH if you don\u2019t attend YTA for doing this and then coming on here to get validation for your choices.", "A offhand promise he made to your kid when he was 3-4 years old. I doubt your child remembered til you brought it up. It sucks, but your child will get over it. Plans change all the time and it\u2019s best you deal with it at this age than someone else. Please don\u2019t turn this minor thing into a wedge between your family.", "NTA.  He made a promise, he should be the one to explain to his nephew why he's suddenly unwanted.  Everyone's trying to guilt you about your relationship with your brother, yet your brother apparently isn't required to do anything to maintain his relationship with his nephew?  Reddit is really gross about treating the feelings of children as unimportant.", "YTA - it\u2019s pretty clear that the issue is that you\u2019ll have to find alternative child care for the wedding, not the ring bearing promise. There are many reputable childcare providers. You could also see if there is an Adventure Kids - I loved when my mom would let me play there growing up. \n\nIt\u2019s cute that your brother made a promise to your (at the time) 4 year old son. But this was over a year ago\u2026 He\u2019s five - if you stop bringing up the wedding I\u2019m positive your kid will forget about the promise. Trust me, this is not worth potentially ruining your relationship with your brother over. \n\nAlso, if it\u2019s really such a big deal to you that your son is the ring bearer, just suggest doing a cute little ring bearing ceremony in your vacation house around their one month anniversary. All your family will still be in town. I honestly think it could be a sweet activity where your kids can give your SIL and brother they rings and they could say their vows. It\u2019s not like your kid will know it isn\u2019t the real wedding\u2026", "Not an AH for being disappointed, but YTA for using your kid as a pawn like this.  You're mad that his wedding will be difficult to turn into the month-long trip you anticipated and are trying to inflict some form of punishment on your brother. Your son is five.  You can make up a separate \"ring bear\" ceremony and he won't know the difference. You also have other options, like still going to visit family for the month but skipping out on the child-free ceremony, or perhaps your husband could watch the kids during the ceremony while you go.", "Soft on NTA.  Your brother made a promise to your child and he also knows you have to travel with children.  Why is everything about what the bride wants? Does the groom get no say?  He said she put her foot down.  Well buddy, get use to that foot.", "NTA - This is the first I've heard of a child free wedding when close family members have kids.  If I were you I would not attend.   When asked why, I'd say it's a child free wedding and I'm not child free.  \n\nIf he tries to negotiate some solution where you dump your kids somewhere a few days I'd just respond that that's not how parenting works.   It's not like dropping off dogs at a kennel, and that he'll understand when he's a parent.", "YTA \n\nYou're making your brothers engagement news and wedding all about you and your son. You should be congratulating him and his fianc\u00e9. Letting them tell you about the proposal and wedding plans and letting them enjoy their moment. \n\nHave a mock wedding at home with your husband get all dressed up, have a \"fancy\" dinner at home  and let your son be the ring bear and have his fun so he can get it out of his system. Take lots of photos and let this be a core memory for him. \n\nYou gave 3 options cool here's a few more:\n\n1. You and your husband fly over with the kids, your husband skips the wedding. \n2. You fly in attend the wedding your husband comes with the kids later on. \n3. You get a room at the the hotel/wedding location hire a sitter referred to you by friends/family and check in on the kids occasionally.\n4. You and your family fly in with a trusted friend/sitter they stay for a few days (at your expense) to watch the kids and you can have your fun adult time knowing your kids are in trusted hands. \n\nImagine how you would feel if someone made your engagement/wedding all about them.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  It is cute about your son dreaming of being a ring bearer before he was conceived and calling it \u201cbear\u201d instead of barer.  All cute.  It sounds like your brother hadn\u2019t proposed at the time, did not have a fianc\u00e9 or a wedding at the time and made a comment offhand in response to hearing your son said he wanted to have been the ring bearer at his parents\u2019 wedding.  It is fine for your child to be disappointed.\n\nPeople are within their rights to have child free weddings and it isn\u2019t a personal affront to those with children or those for whom childcare arrangements are complicated.  It is unfortunate to live abroad when a loved one is getting married or to be working out challenges to being able to attend.  People are also allowed to settle on the specific plans for their weddings after the actual engagement. \n\nIt is fine to ask, *ask* your brother if he would be the person to let your son down.  In this situation I don\u2019t think it is a good idea to threaten or guilt your brother.  \n\nI\u2019m a kindergarten teacher.  Part of growing up and getting bigger is handling disappointment.  I think you should manage yours then work on helping your son manage his.  Something about the tone of your post also makes me wonder if it\u2019s possible that in fact this is a bigger deal to you than it is to your son.  It probably was a bad idea to confirm to your son that he was the ring bearer before checking in with your brother to his specific plan.", "Why can\u2019t you take your children and then have a babysitter for the day of the wedding? Then you can all stay for the entire month like you planned.  \n\nI think it\u2019s fine to have your brother explain to your son, but if he doesn\u2019t then you should. Whoever explains just needs to tell your son that they are having a grownup only wedding, so there isn\u2019t going to be a ring bearer (I think in this situation the best man just hands groom the ring). He\u2019ll be disappointed but plans change and hopefully your brother will learn not to make big promises like that.", "I kind of think you\u2019re being a dramatic YTA. Your son will recover emotionally from not being the ring bearer and you will be able to find child care for the wedding just fine. What won\u2019t recover is your relationship with your sibling.", "I would say lightly YTA. Although I understand keeping a promise may be important to you, I think you need to understand that in life things change, and don't always go your way. I think this is an important lesson for your son (especially when you mention how much he is gloating and bragging about it to other people). Your brother had the best intentions BEFORE he got engaged and likely did not know his finance would not want children at the wedding. I think your brother, your son and you should sit down and talk about this. Be honest with him in saying that your brother hoped he would be the ring bearer but somethings things change and we have to work it out.

Go visit your family. Bring your kids. Your husband doesn\u2019t have to go to the wedding if it is such a big fucking deal to have a babysitter. Your son literally doesn\u2019t know what the fuck a wedding is or what a ring bearer even is so just ask your brother and his fianc\u00e9 if they\u2019d be open to you throwing a little celebration dinner where you do a little ceremony where she gives her son her engagement ring and asks him to put it at her plate for her so it\u2019s safe for the dinner. Bam, ring bearer role complete, your entire family celebrates your brother\u2019s wedding, you all spend a month with your family and all with the added bonus that you stop acting like your son is the center of the universe.", "All the Y t A votes about the kid getting over it when you know darn well if this were a bridesmaid suddenly being uninvited or taken out of the wedding party they'd be upset as hell.

Yes it is in-fact inconvenient for this to happen but a promise made a year ago about a wedding that had zero plans set in stone at the time is not a promise that your brother can uphold due to new plans/changed plans. \n\nYTA making it about your child since its not your wedding, but your brother does need to explain to his nephew what is going on and like someone else stated, this is a learning experience that shows changes in life happen even if you don\u2019t want them.", "NTA. Every situation is different, but in most cases you're just an asshole for having a child free wedding. People want a wedding they can't afford, and so they reduce the guest list by cutting out children. Don't give me some crock of shit about how you want an adults only experience - weddings are almost universally a family event.\n\nIt causes all of these conflicts because it's heartless and shameful. Your brother doesn't want to talk to his nephew because he's embarrassed by his decision. Perhaps his inability to take ownership of the decision is a pretty good indicator that he's an asshole for making it in the first place.", "Info: What about inviting a friend to travel with you to the wedding but stay at the hotel with the kids?", "YTA.  Obviously he made a promise without discussing it with his fianc\u00e9.

The bride usually has a lot of input in these things and  frankly,  you spent a lot of effort saying why childcare was the real problem.

About a year ago, my brother (34M) reassured my son that he could be the ring bearer at his wedding. This conversation occurred after he heard us talking about mine and his dad's wedding and was very offended he wasn't invited despite the fact that wouldn't be conceived for another three years after the event. My son really latched onto this comment.\n\nNow, all these months later, my brother has proposed and is planning a wedding with his fianc\u00e9e. When I told my son that his uncle was getting married, he was obviously overjoyed and immediately launched into bragging to his younger brother (who wasn't born when the initial conversation took place and was just giving him typical baby babbles in return) that he got the be the 'ring bear.'\n\nI heard the proposal news from my mom and when I called to congratulate my brother, I also told him the story of how excited our oldest is. My brother went on to tell me that his fianc\u00e9e is pretty adamant about a child free wedding, so the promise he made might not be doable anymore.\n\nThis was obviously hard for me to hear. Not only would this break my son's heart, this would also make mine and my husband's lives considerably harder. We're currently living abroad and didn't think we would have to find childcare for the time of the wedding. Our only options now would be:\n\n1. Fly to the wedding and leave our children in the care of people we don't fully trust since all trusted family members will be attending the ceremony\n\n2. Leave both children with a trusted friend near our home and fly to the wedding (not ideal since, thanks to flexible work schedules, we were planning to spend a month with our families following the wedding... flying in for the celebration, flying home to pick up our children, and then flying back is too exhausting. Them flying alone obviously isn't an option.)\n\n3. Not attend.\n\nMy brother said he would try to get his fianc\u00e9e to reconsider, but we spoke two nights ago and he said she's putting her foot down. Admittedly, I was hurt over this on my son's behalf. I told him we would still try to make it, but it was unlikely that we could. I also told him that if he even wanted us to consider coming, he would have to tell his nephew himself that he was going back on his promise and why.\n\nMy brother said it felt like I was issuing him an ultimatum and making him choose between family and his wife on what's supposed to be the happiest day of his life and that I was being unfair. I said he shouldn't have made promises he couldn't keep.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe you could even compromise to let the kids attend the ceremony and then the sitter could take them back to wherever you'd be staying so if your brother would go for it.

If you are unable to go because of distance that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole but you seem very entitled and the fact that you want to punish your brother and upset your son in the process for this is also extreme and overdramatic. I would just rsvp no you can\u2019t come and call it a day.

We can have a separate argument about the merits on no kids vs kids at a wedding, and I\u2019d be inclined to agree with the majority that kids at a wedding aren\u2019t that big of a deal. But a lot of people are calling the brother an AH for breaking a promise, when it isn\u2019t the case that he *intentionally broke it*.\n\nThe brother is still a soft AG for the whole ultimatum schtick, he should explain to his nephew why kids are not allowed.\n\nAlso, all the comments about \u201cdon\u2019t make promises you cannot keep\u201d are low key ludicrous.

When I married almost 20 years ago, one of my groomsmen, one of my best friends, was living abroad. I did everything I could to accommodate him. He got tux measurements taken where he was and sent them to me, I calculated them from metric into imperial American nonsense, paid for everything except his plane ticket. I wanted him there.

He was the one living abroad, and his wife also was from another country several time zones and an expensive flight away.

My younger two siblings had their plane tickets paid for by \u201cloans\u201d from my parents who also attended (loans that, something like 8 years later now, still have not been paid back at all), and claimed they didn\u2019t have enough to also help me. And so, I missed my best friend, my best man, my brother\u2019s wedding altogether.\n\nThe point of all this \u201cme\u201d - there is always a compromise, and you need to find it and work on it.

SO, party is planned\u2014I asked for there to be other kids my g'son's age and their parents also\u2014friends of theirs that I've known for years\u2014 so it will be very kid oriented\u2014which is what I want for my b'day. None of the kids know because Covid, which is going around pretty heavily right now, could put a stop to it. Sure, they would all survive the disappointment, but why raise kids' hopes beforehand, much less PROMISE something and then renege? I mean, your brother told a 5 yo that he would be his \"ring bear.\" C'mon!", "NTA, exactly, but handling your kid's emotions is ultimately your responsibility.  No one acted maliciously, so it's time to suck it up and start teaching your kid that sometimes they don't get what they want, plans change, and its ok to be disappointed but its going to happen in life.  It'd be nice if he had a talk with your kid and maybe apologizes but the explanation really is on you.\n\n Also it's her wedding, not your kid's day, the kid will get over it.", "NTA.

I can completely understand the child-free aspect for the bride-to-be, but I think she is missing an opportunity here. The ceremony can be child free and still have a ring-bearer be a child. The reception, when most of the need for child-free happens, can remain that way, and she can secure a place at the venue where your son is located, with you and various family members cycling in and out to care for him.

Adults need to own up to their mistakes and choices, and have to face whatever consequences come with them. This is a pretty easy consequence because all brother has to do is explain to a 5 year old that his wife doesn\u2019t want kids at the wedding.

But that doesn\u2019t mean I have to want them at my special events. I\u2019m not inviting ANYONE who doesn\u2019t know how to act.", "NTA omg soooooo NTA. I highly recommend you skip the wedding and instead use the time to do a \u2018family honeymoon\u2019 thing. Have your son watch an extra bad wedding video, and show him that y\u2019all are getting the better end of the deal here! I understand that your brother is in a tough spot, but a wedding is a two way thing. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s fair to say that you\u2019re making him choose between his wife or his family, because if his family was super important to him, I feel his future wife should be willing to hear that out? She\u2019s fully entitled to her feelings/ opinions, but obviously your brother had a different idea for his wedding originally, given the promise he made to your son. She could even offer a compromise where your son is the ring bearer, but you step outside the second he\u2019s done or your kids start fussing or something similar. This is a case where the couple can decide to have the wedding as they want with no wiggle room, or adapt a little to have a close family member there. They gave the ultimatum, not you. They said \u2018you can\u2019t bring your kids\u2019 which really isn\u2019t possible given your living situation, so you said \u2018okay we won\u2019t\u2019. Hopefully your brother apologizes to his nephew, because I suspect their relationship will be deeply damaged  if he doesn\u2019t.", "Tbh you should tell your child that the uncle and his fianc\u00e9 have changed plans and it's gonna be an event for adults only. Therefore, you don't feel comfortable going anymore because your family comes first and you rather stay with your kids than going to a place where they're not welcome. And if the kid asks about the promise, just tell them sometimes things change in life and some promises can be broken. But tell them to ask the uncle about it anyway lol", "I have a daughter and if her grandparents promise her something, even though she\u2019s two she will remember like a promised grandparent sleep over. I just take her to them and if they choose they don\u2019t want to keep her for the night, then they get to deal with daughters melt down.\n\nPeople stop making promise they won\u2019t keep, if you throw the consequences in their face for them to deal with. If you deal with it they think it\u2019s fine and will do it again at your dismay.", "I agree with you. Sadly, we had to have a childfree wedding (which in my country means minor free). Because of the drama my own sister was causing (her children were age 3 to 16 for 3 children, the entire age group ranged from 1 to 16 for 12 children). We were willing to have a nanny for the younger children, a play area, a sleeping area and a meal all children would love. The oldest two (14 and 16) could choose, 8 dinner course or the same meal as the other children. \n\nAfter two days of drama, the conclusion was very simple, no children. Sometimes chooses are made, not because of the wishes of the couple but because of the impossible demands other family members make.", "You are super comfy spending OP's money and stretching his trust in people. \n\nHe congratulated, this came after. Kid might not remember specifics but could hold on to impressions. What's wrong with a video chat where the uncle goes 'sorry kiddo...'. Uncle planted the seed, uncle picks out the weed.", "I'm really surprised to read you are a kindergarten teacher.

It probably was a bad idea to confirm to your son that he was the ring bearer before checking in with your brother to his specific plan.\n\nIt was the groom who promised the ops son. So it should be the groom to deal with birth breaking the promise and dealing with the disappointment.", "Good way of dealing with it. People getting to make big promises with all the good feelings and happiness that come with it, then slink away without consequences when it\u2019s time to follow through, is the worst.\n\nAt least adults can recognize this behavior for what it is, but children haven\u2019t yet developed that layer of protective cynicism and experience.", "We don't know if the brother knew about his fiancee wanting the wedding to be childfree. It actually sounds like he didn't. So he made a promise, and maybe only after that his fiancee tells him that she wants it to be childfree and it's non-negotiable. \n\nBut yeah, OP's brother should just accept that OP won't be able to attend.", "I agree with your point of view. In addition to this, your son was not going to be strictly a child attendant at the wedding. He was also supposed to be a part of the wedding party.

Drunk orgies before dessert is served?", "I hate to say this, your in such a tight spot, but I don't think you should go to the wedding, or visit surrounding the wedding.  Not in a malicious way at all.  Your son is really going to be hurt by this, no matter who tells him. Bringing him there to visit your family is going to just keep salting that wound for a child that (assuming he is like most children) is going to have a hard time controlling those emotions when everyone around him is only talking about the wedding.  And while you might think \"well they won't be talking to him about it\" kids aren't dumb.  He heard your wedding story and you weren't talking to him right?  \n\nThe whole trip might be dark clouded by this.  He's 5 and he has feelings and his excitement is about to be destroyed.  \n\nIf you want to go to the wedding, I think it should be only you, and only for the wedding.  Not a family visit/vacation.  \n\nThat being said, I do think it sucks his fiancee won't make an exception for his brother who lives in another country and would inevitably face a very difficult decision.  Yes its her right to have a child free wedding.  So now it's your right to not attend, or only visit alone for the wedding.", "It was only a year ago.  I would bet he was already dating and even serious with his current fiance.  Either that, or they've been dating less than a year and the wedding vows are another impulsive promise the brother has no intention of keeping", "Still wouldn't help logistically since they have a second child who appears to be too young to be in the wedding.", "Brother is refusing to be the one to tell the nephew. That's why he's the asshole. He made a promise, reneged, then wanted someone else to do the hard part of telling the 5 year old it's not happening.", "Honestly, I\u2019ve heard of and personally witnessed several weddings made awkward or even downright ruined by a family member, and it was always, without fail, and adult and not a child. Never heard anybody tell a story where their 5-year-old cousin got drunk and puked on the dance floor and tried to grope other guests or where their friend\u2019s toddler showed up wearing a suspiciously wedding-like dress just to upstage the bride. People hate kids because they\u2019re vulnerable and easy to pick on with little repercussion.", "I'm going to go ahead and say a part of the reason today's kids seem to struggle more in social situations and what appropriate behaviour looks like is because of a lack of exposure to these situations and a drive towards individualism (\"my kids, my rules\") in parenting vs the it takes a village mindset. The past is not a dreamland, but one thing our great grands got right was that children were a part of everyday life. How is a child going to learn how to behave in social situations like weddings if participating in these situations is becoming an increasingly rare opportunity?\n\nIt's the job of a child to rebel and test social norms, that's how they learn; it's the job of an adult, any adult, to guide them to act appropriately and model the right behaviours. Societies that have a more communal approach to childrearing generally have better socialised children and less frustrated adults: piss poor parenting is less of an issue when any adult can and does speak up when kids step out of line.", "I think that if those adults don't have mentality of actual toddler, they should understand. \n\nI mean this here is nice example of acting like a kid or its parent is an issue while the actual issue as some unrelated adult. Who would start drama and be generally unreasonable.", "That\u2019s not what happened tho?", "But the kid was a kid, not a 25 year old. He has the mental and emotional intelligence of a kid.

They are going to get bored and demand the attention of their parents who won\u2019t be able to engage in the celebrations as a result, but a relative of the bride and groom is going to be surrounded by family members and excited to be a part of it all.

I\u2019m very close with my cousin but I was bored at her wedding (I was about 10) and I was actually a part of my favourite uncle\u2019s wedding when I was about 4 or 5 and I was also bored. It\u2019s great that you thought about what your nephews would like and that they enjoyed themselves but like 9 times out of 10 weddings are a party with a lot of (sometimes drunk) adults doing adult stuff like talking and dancing, they have to sit quietly through a boring ceremony and while a bunch of adults give long speeches, and there aren\u2019t many opportunities for games/activities that kids might enjoy, unless the couple *specifically* plans for that", "Yeah having an exception for the grooms brother who lives out of country is not going be offensive.", "My dad promised to keep a rock I gave him the rest of his life.

This was many years ago when I was still a kid as well, but when my adult cousin got married out of state, the ceremony was \"child free\" in that people could bring their children, there were child ring barers and flower girls. However, they \"rented\" the daycare space from the church as well and set up a baby/child area that some of the older teenagers and young adults in the family volunteered to watch over. Once my cousin walked down the aisle and everyone was settled up front before the vows began, there was a moment where people could usher their children to the back to go play in the daycare. Most infants stayed with their parents but if there was a time when they were getting to be too fussy, they had a maternity room set up that also had a live feed of the ceremony. \n\nThey did this because they wanted a child free ceremony but didn't want to exclude any family members and still wanted the children to take part in the \"nonboring\" parts if they wanted to. It provided an option for parents out of state to still attend and the kids that did want to be involved wouldn't feel left out. I understand that they spent a LOT of money to set all that up but I feel like even an inexpensive wedding could potentially set up a play area to help with potential interruptions at least.", "Exactly this.  NTA.  I myself am a child free person, who would have a child free wedding if I got married, and doesn\u2019t even really like children.  Despite all that, I still agree it\u2019s a dick move to get a kid\u2019s (or anyone\u2019s) hopes up and then back out.

If that\u2019s a line you can\u2019t personally cross then fair play, don\u2019t do anything you\u2019re uncomfortable with, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an AH move on the brothers part. Again, he\u2019s an AH for hurting the kid, but that\u2019s it", "Agreed. Our ceremony was very short. The nieces were the flower girls, my son was the ring bear(er). So they were involved which helps the ceremony to go by even faster. All the kids love live music and dancing. I also had glow sticks and bubbles. They had a great time.", "He did! He has since passed now but at the time we found it, he had kept it for over 20 years. The funniest part was that he had no memory of me giving it to him and had always just kept it. But I remembered it clearly. It had a hole in the middle of so that was why I gave it to him I guess. Who knows why four year olds do what they do though, lol.", "Brother is an ah for being dramatic now saying you\u2019re ruining my wedding! Just by being asked to man up and explain to the kid what\u2019s going on. You want a child free wedding deal with the consequences.", "YTA \u2705  \n\ud83d\udd75\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f going off your replies in this thread, here are some issues:\n\n*\u201cif my brother can\u2019t make that happen for me then I\u2019m about to start planning my own vow renewal\u201d*  \n\u2026your brother shouldn\u2019t be worried about making anything happen for YOU when it comes to HIS wedding \n\n*\u201cI see a wedding as a very family oriented event about bringing two individuals (and the people who shaped their lives) together.\u201d*  \n\u2026the way YOU see a wedding is irrelevant, the only views that matter are your brother and his partner on THEIR wedding, end of story\n\n*\u201cThe thought of going to the wedding that my son was so excited about without him is a very uniquely cruel brand of dad guilt.\u201d*  \n\u2026this sounds like this is a parenting hurdle YOU have to overcome and work through, this has nothing to do with your brother\n\n*\u201cThe dream scenario would be exceptions made\u201d*  \n\u2026at the end of the day you\u2019re not really going to be open to compromise or any of the many alt options that people have listed here because deep down you want this wedding to be a family event for YOU. you have centred this situation around yourself and your family completely. \n\nOP, you're telling on yourself with these replies. your pride has made this situation about yourself and your family unit, when in reality you are 2 out of how many guests invited - 100, 200? why are you unable to attend this event on your own...ego?", "Totally agree!  I don\u2019t even tell our kids that Grandma is coming to visit until she\u2019s on the plane\ud83d\ude05 Stuff happens and kids can\u2019t remember what they did yesterday but they WILL remember something out of the norm!", "The child care thing is a red herring. Are you saying there is no trusted family member or friend attending that wedding with kids? There is so much time to arrange this and find a trusted babysitter with references. I have had no issue arranging babysitting in 3 different countries as my family travelled at various ages. Some arranged through friends, some via agency with stellar references. At a wedding if the venue is a hotel even easier - kids are nearby and you can check on them often.\n\nThat said NTA. People make choices. If their choices make it difficult for your guests to come to the wedding guests can politely decline.", "My partner did the same with his twin nieces regarding an old game called Bully. They could play it when they were 13. I think they were about 8 at the time.\n\nYou bet they remembered! And indeed got it as part of their birthday present \ud83d\ude06", "The wedding being held after most kids' bedtime is a completely valid reason not to invite the kids.", "Then **you** have them at **your** wedding.  There's a world of difference between dehumanizing kids and deciding that you want to have an adult event.", "i absolutely would hate that at my wedding and there's nothing wrong with that. people are allowed to not want kids there", "I had a childfree wedding because our venue was small and a tight fit, so I didn't want little kids running around tripping the other guests.  My 10 year old nephew ushered my mom down the aisle to her seat, stayed for the ceremony, ate dinner with everyone and then went back to the hotel with a sitter my sister graciously paid to bring with her.  \n\nAbsolutely love my nephew; he's been my buddy since he was born and I was 18 but I was already so stressed about the day adding in any kids I didn't know (the only kids were DH's cousins kids) would have done me in.  He knows how important  he is to me because of every other day, not my wedding day.  In fact, I think the only reason he was excited with the wedding was because he could now call DH \"Uncle Ben\".  But there are many other reasons to have a childfree wedding other than 'appearances'.", "\"Son, uncle has different plans for his wedding than when he talked to you about your job in the wedding, plans change sometimes and thats okay, we can celebrate with them when we visit next time\" shit changes, uncle probably shouldn't have promised kid anything but it was most likely an offhanded comment to try to console the kid, no one knew the kid would take it to heart sometimes they remember every detail, sometimes they forget, uncle absolutely should not start his marriage by putting his nephew before his fiance.", "What about renewing your vows and have him be in that?", "Every wedding I've ever been to that had trouble - it was caused by drunk adults. \n\nI don't like the whole child-free thing either, people act like its a normal thing that doesn't need to be explained. If you don't want your family there you need to explain why. If you're excluding their children you need to accept they probably won't be thrilled about the massive problem of childcare you just handed them.", "Why would his future wife be able to \"disallow\" anything unilaterally?  I know grooms are just props but his wants should be just as valid as a bridezilla's.", "Also she could be \"putting her foot down\" on an \"all children are invited\" wedding - which is entirely fair because not everyone wants their wedding to become a finger-painting cr\u00e8che.\n\nHowever, it's increasingly common for \"child-free\" to not apply for the couple's kids, or kids who are \"in\" the wedding (like flower girls or ring bearers). Maybe she hadn't considered that as an option?\n\nThen again doing this would depend on how insane the families are and if people are likely to pitch an unholy fit if any \"exceptions\" don't extend to their own children.", "I think it's a response to knowing too many people who are assholes about their children. \n\nLike, my dad's side of the family? They're all assholes and they genuinely LOOOOOVE it when their children make scenes at important events. These are people who will stay in a church with a child screaming bloody murder and just make increasingly loud \"there, there; there theeeeeere!\" singy songy noises at the kid instead of taking them out of the wedding. Or they will giggle and egg their older kid on when they're kicking the pew in front of them and making a loud banging noise. \n\nHowever, they behave much more decently when their kids aren't around, so people in my family often make the choice to do \"no kids\" at weddings since it's considered even worse to invite the good kids, but not the bad kids.", "That is weird setup. You want them there for parts where they are most likely to disturb something official and then exclude them during parts where they are least likely to be an issue?", "I would probably actually prefer explaining it to my kid myself rather than have someone else do it.", "Because some people don't want kids at their wedding. That simple. I personally could care less, but if I'm doing some sort of destination wedding or a more vacation type wedding then yeah sorry but I'm not dealing with kids in that sort of scenario. If it's just an open party in a big hall then yeah I don't mind", ">Honestly, I really don't understand why people demand child free weddings. \n\nIt can also be a way to keep down the numbers. My mom is from a big Catholic family. All her siblings had their own big Catholic families. When one of my cousins got married, making it child-free automatically eliminated something like 30 people from the head count. Which, if you're trying to have a wedding on a budget, is a considerable savings.", "But what if the shit parents are family or you have four cousins, and each cousin is married and has 3-5 kids each? That was my situation with mine and my wife\u2019s wedding and her family is the exact opposite, one cousin that\u2019s like a sister with two daughters, where I have over 20 second cousins that are kids. I wasn\u2019t gonna ask her parents to pay for that much extra food and I couldn\u2019t afford it. So we did child free except for my nephew, who was the ring bearer, and her cousins two daughters who are more like nieces with how close they are, as the flower girls.  The great thing about that night, the one set of cousins that was the most upset about not being able to bring all six of their kids from age 4-13, told us later that was the best night they had in such a long time because they never take time for themselves as adults!", "Cost is the biggest factor. Some pay per plate for food. Space is another. If the venue only holds 100 guests, most would prefer to invite 40 couples and 20 single people than 30 couples, 20 singles, and 20 kids. Kids have to be invited or excluded as a whole. In other words, if your cousin has a kid that screams bloody murder whenever they don\u2019t get their way, it\u2019s easier to say NO kids than no to some kids. Some adults are inconsiderate. One person posted on a sub that her sister got married recently and one parent let the baby cry through the entire ceremony. At the reception, a kid had a meltdown about the cupcakes on the cake table, grabbed one, and knocked the whole table over. \n\nThat\u2019s why.", "Oops, thanks for pointing that out.", " But she said she wanted a child-free wedding, so adding more children to the wedding is the exact opposite of a compromise.", "i cant understand all these people saying stuff like this in the comments. what do you mean youre not a fan? its not your wedding. if you want kids at your wedding invite them. if you have a problem with someone else not having them then dont go. its so weird and entitled to comment negatively though on someone elses wedding because they didnt invite people they didnt want there", "Like a little Bachelor!! What a little heartbreaker.", "No i agree, i should have clarified that thats what i think OP should tell the kid", "I'm the other way. I remember being super excited about weddings when I was small. I got to meet cousins I didn't see often, and sometimes the bride would *gasp* dance with me, which was like meeting a Real Live Princess.", "I also loved weddings when I was a kid. I always played with the other kids that I met there. It was always fun. We also danced a lot. Loved looking at the bride\u2019s dress and of course CAKE. \n\nThe kids at my wedding they were playing with each other.", "Definitely a parenting problem, not the B&Gs. Stay home with that shit.", "Parenting 100%. \n\nMy wedding wasn\u2019t child free. My own kid cried almost the entire time (4 at the time). My husbands business partners kids almost knocked over the cake during speeches while their parents ignored them.", "Exactly. I want a \u201cflower guy\u201d to throw dollar bills instead of petals. My wedding is not gonna be meant for kids. I wanna take shots and throw ass. I\u2019m not doing that in front of kids.", "Yes I\u2019ll shoot her a message to let her know the places she can step out to if he\u2019s feeling fussy, but even with me asking she\u2019s the type to go her own way so, he\u2019s a chill baby and I\u2019m hoping it stays that way", "so sorry this is happening? dude its not her wedding. its her brothers. what are you sorry about? that theyre doing the wedding the way that they want and not the way she wants?", "i loved weddings better than christmas, for all these reasons! and kids dancing at a reception feels like good luck for the couple, you know? very ancient and traditional good luck.", "This is so wholesome", "Not everyone is excited to have a crybaby at their wedding. Not everyone finds it cute. Not everyone wants children to be part of THEIR life", "> The brother shouldn't be held to a promise he made before he ever planned to get married.\n\nHe's not being held to his promise though. OP is still willing to come without their child if circumstances allow. They just want their brother to explain themselves why his nephew is no longer invited. \n\nThe brother is being an asshole by trying to offload that responsibility to OP, even though he himself made the promise.", "Things change in life, but the brother not explaining to his nephew makes him an asshole. If you can't keep a promise, you should at least have the dignity and respect to apologize and explain why you can't keep it.", "> The brother shouldn't be held to a promise he made before he ever planned to get married. \n\n...and he's not. He's being asked to explain to the person he promised why that promise is not being upheld. \"That was before I knew I'd be marrying a woman that doesn't want kids at her wedding, and that includes kids in my family, like you, champ!\"", "The edit is delightful. I love the idea of a ring putter onner.", "My niece had 3 boys when she remarried.  The oldest and middle were groomsmen, the youngest walked down the aisle with a sign on to announce his mom.  It was cute.", "Or, the brother could grow a pair and get his fiance to compromise. All i get out out of this is fiance wants, fiance wont budge. Really? I guess its all her wedding and calling all the shots. Doesnt matter what the brother wants or feels, her way all the way. If she would budge, maybe he shouldnt budge either.", "The title made it seem like OP promised his son that he'd be a ring bear(er) at his uncle's wedding, or at the very least, that he'd be invited to the wedding when in reality Uncle made no such promise.", "I totally get this is a personal choice and there is no right or wrong. Personally I would ask the parents if the wild kids to leave my wedding at once.", "I have seen a kid jump on the bride's dress(the flower girl) at one wedding, and I have had a kid run around screaming during the vows and the parents do nothing about it (He was the ring bearer). It's the difficult kids and bad parents that make it a nightmare.", "I also think allowing nieces and nephews of the couple is different from allowing everyone who has children to bring them. Most people know their siblings' kids and how their siblings parent. Also, one reason to have a childfree wedding is to slash down the guest list to stay under the venue's cap and save some money. Allowing children who are close family members to attend while otherwise having a childfree wedding makes sense to me.", "NTA.\n\nThey do not *have* to have children at their wedding, the same way you do not *have* to attend.\n\nBut your brother broke his promise because he made it before he could secure it. It\u2019s his responsibility to relay this news to your son. The little boy deserves an explanation the same as any adult does.\n\nAs an aside, I\u2019m a little disturbed by the vast amount of comments from people who just flat out despise the very concept of children. Like I know Reddit makes it trendy to not like kids, but *damn.* The Trunchbull from Matilda wasn\u2019t supposed to be the hero of the story.\n\nHave you considered holding a private mock-wedding between you and your husband and letting your oldest be the \u201cring bear\u201d? You could even get your youngest in on it. You and your husband could re-read your vows to each other with a cute little intricate festivity in the backyard.", "Yes this would be such a great memory for the kids. I found it so cute when he said \"ring bear\".", "I don\u2019t get it either. The ceremony, yeah I get not having kids there - someone always starts crying, it interrupts the ceremony, the parents have to awkwardly apologise and drag the child out. But the reception too? Kids should be at weddings, they\u2019re family events.", "Definitely agree! My wedding was in April 2022 and we invited all the kids to come. Everyone that we've talked to since then has said that their kids haven't stopped talking about the wedding and how much fun they had. For most of them it was their first wedding.", "Some of it is cost too. If people show up with a three kids, 20% of them throwing tantrums and you\u2019re still stuck dropping $75 a head for them\u2026 that adds up.", "Yeah they\u2019re totally common now, much easier for me as a waitress lol", "Sorry, do you mean have the children put the wedding rings on the adults? And is this in the parents do over wedding or the child free wedding? I apologize, I'm confused.", "Not wanting kids at your wedding is not a red flag.  If brother made this promise without any input from his spouse (whether she was around or not), that's on him.", "Not everyone is comfortable leaving their kids with people they don't know. And I'm not saying anything, I'm just responding to the OP.", "She probably pointed out all the other kids they'd have to invite if they invited OP's kids. And maybe some of those other kids are really poorly behaved. It's tricky when you'd love to have certain kids there, but others would be shrieking and fighting and sticking their hands in your cake. Plus it really adds a lot to the guest count, which means you'd have to cut a lot of adults from your list.\n\nWhen I was little, all of us kids were put in my uncle's finished basement with some babysitters. I had a grand old time. And although my parents didn't know the babysitters, my uncle knew them well and they trusted his judgment.", "Its OP who lives abroad though, presumably the rest of the family are all still back home where the wedding is. It would be different if the Brother lived abroad and expected everyone to come to him. These are just the kind of things people face when they emigrate, family events get tricky, its inevitable but its not the rest of the family's fault.", "Yesssssssss", "Yeah, when I get married it will very much not be a family affair lol. MAYBE three members of my family will be invited.", "I went to a wedding at nine years old, and would have just *died* if I pulled any of that shit, my parents wouldn't have had to kill me.", "Whoopsie!", "Yea I knew how to act when I was a kid. I\u2019d side eye poorly behaved kids. But I\u2019m an adult and I understand that when kids are bored they do dumb shit. Like run around a wedding reception.", "Tell her that if he starts making noise at the wedding and she doesn't take him out, that both of them will be escorted out.", "I mean maybe but that feels more disruptive than a fussy baby honestly, if anything I\u2019ll ask my aunt to make sure she actually steps out.\n\nI\u2019m not toooo worried, but gotta love anxiety!", "Well, you know your cousin better than I do. If you think that a gentle reminder will be enough to let her know that her baby is only welcome at the ceremony until/unless he makes noise, then go for it. I just know that some people need more than just a gentle reminder/suggestion. For instance, I'm neurodivergent and your \"suggestion of places to take the baby if he cries\" would (possibly?) read to me as \"If you want to step out and take the baby away if he cries, here are the places you can take him, but you're under no obligation to leave! Feel free to stay even if he makes a fuss!\" \n\nAlso, I realize now that I misunderstood \"she\u2019s the type to go her own way\" to mean \"she's the type to do her own thing and decide that it's okay to let him cry in the wedding even when told not to.\" But now I realize that you probably meant just the opposite.", "Exactly! A parent can talk them down, for instance, g'son mentioned Xmas, how he had written to Santa so he was pretty sure what he was getting, and my daughter told him, well, you know, Santa likes letters, but sometimes it is fun for him to think stuff up on his own. So Xmas morning, the gifts he got that were labeled \"from Santa,\" he opened them and said, \" Santa is a genius!\" Or, \"what was he thinking!\" when he did not like the gift, and we all had a good laugh.", "A friend of mine who got married recently and has a kid did this.

She doesn\u2019t seem very family oriented.", "When my aunt and uncle were getting married, I had already been the flower girl in another wedding. Although my aunt and uncle had initially said I was going to be the flower girl, I had another cousin born and old enough to do the job and I was a little too old for the gig by the time the official wedding planning started. My aunt, who was marrying into the family, talked to me about it. And that\u2019s how our relationship has always been\u2014open and honest communication. But she said, \u201cI know we asked you first, but your cousin hasn\u2019t been a flower girl yet. Can we have you light our candles?\u201d\n\n1.) acknowledged that they made the promise\n2.) encouraged sympathy and understanding\n3.) still found a way to include me in the ceremony\n\nStill my favorite aunt over 20 years later. Always will be.", "Teenagers are also old enough to pick up on the fact that no one else their age is there and maybe even put two and two together that they weren't supposed to be there at all.", "As an aunt of two kids with ADHD (and a person with ADHD myself) I can confirm that it's not always a kid problem.\n\nBut then again, my sister (and my parents, when I was a kid) wouldn't have taken the kids to a wedding if they thought they wouldn't behave."]}
