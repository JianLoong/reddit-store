UPDATE", "selftext": "Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bl9ka/wibta_if_i_kept_my_dads_dog_against_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nSo I guess it's customary to give an update on these things, and since a few people started following me after my previous post I figured I ought to finish the story. It's only been a few days but a lot has happened\n\nEllen finally agreed to meet up earlier today. Ironically, though people were telling me to break up with her, she beat me to the punch. We talked over coffees for a few hours, and what many of you suggested was true - her real reason for not wanting to keep Mila was separate from all of the ones she offered me. She said that she thinks I've just changed too much since we got her, and when I asked what she meant she stated that I'm \"less passionate and engaged with her than before\". I don't really know if I can do anything with that, whether it's to do with the stress of my father's condition or not, but she basically said I'm not the person she fell in love with anymore. She's packing up her things even as I type this. It's hard in a way I can't describe, like all of a sudden I'm losing all of the people I love. But I also know that I can't control her decision to leave if that's what she wants\n\nIn brighter news, Mila is doing well. Some of you were concerned that Ellen might 'spirit her away', but she's still very much around. I brought her to the hospital park area to see my dad and she was over the moon to be with him again, so I'll probably keep that up as long as he's able. I've also taken up the recommendations to find a doggy daycare for the days I'm in the office. I'll start dropping her off there next week, and if all goes well I'm sure she'll make plenty of friends\n\nThere isn't much else to say, other than thank you. There's been an enormous amount of love and support coming from this subreddit, people were sending dozens of heartfelt messages (I even had to turn my phone off because all the notifications were too much of a distraction at work). I wanted to let you know all your kind words mean so much to me, even if I felt a little too awkward to respond to most of the messages. It's a strange and difficult time all around for Mila and I, but we'll try and navigate it as best we can\n\n\nThat's all, I suppose. Thank you for your time!", "created_utc": 1677687115, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f7qir/wibta_if_i_kept_my_dads_dog_against_my/", "score": 2834, "replies": ["So, basically, she\u2019s blaming the dog when it sounds to me like her real issue is a stunning lack of empathy for the fact that it sounds like you are losing your dad - which, as someone who is going through something similar with an aging parent, I\u2019m so sorry, OP. \n\nSeriously, though, this is not about a dog. This sounds a lot me like her expecting you to put her before literally everything, even when she didn\u2019t object to what you told her before she moved in, and even when she knows you are losing your dad and Mila is a part of your dad. As much as it hurts right now, honestly? She\u2019s showing you who she is - she is showing you that she isn\u2019t up for any kind of flexibility when things get hard or sad. I know it\u2019s hard now, but in the end, think about things like having kids with her and so on - if she thinks the dog is disruptive and reduces direct engagement and passion, just wait until she has a kid (and no, becoming a parent doesn\u2019t mean you are no longer an individual with wants and needs, but it does mean that you have to be flexible and willing to reprioritize at times).", "I just wanted to say that you're absolutely doing the right thing, and I wish you and Mila the very best. \n\nYou're a great person, and your ex just wasn't able to see that, and that's her loss. \n\nHopefully you find someone more understanding and less selfish in the future.", "Kudos to you for keeping your promise to your dad.\n\nHonestly, her \"real\" reason for breaking up, sounds no more thought out /honest than the original litany of reasons why you were bad for agreeing to adopt the dog in the first place.\n\nBest of luck in all things, going forward.   There will be a lot of women out there, who are honest, and will find your dedication to the dog / your dad endearing.", "I am so happy for Mila's visit to your dad, i can imagine how much they missed eachother.\n\nAnd i know you feel sad, you did have feelings for Ellen and those cannot dissapear just because you broke up.\n\nHer reason is weird in a way - even kids, longer hours at work, a stressful period of time, an illness, any of this appear in real life and she wasn\u2019t ready to share nor support.\n\nBut you will be fine. You are a good, strong person and things will improve.", "Dog pic tax... Pay up.", "So she never thought that maybe you're currently not \"passionate and engaged\" because you're losing your father?

I should be your priority now, not your dad or his dog.\n\nShe has shown her true colors with this.  She lacks empathy and wanted to be your sole focus.  Your dad and dog are competition for her, and she wanted them *gone*.  When you refused to do that, she realized that she wasn't going to get what she wanted.  She's going to eventually learn a hard lesson that no one out there is going to make her their sole priority (unless it's a dog of her own) and she's going to be very lonely.", "You're going through a deep, profound, lifechanging experience with your dad - of course you're going to change!

Is she not aware of that little fact, or does she just lack empathy?", "You will find someone much better than this woman who has no empathy.  Wouldn\u2019t it be great if Milo was the reason for you to meet a lovely young woman with a kind heart - maybe at a dog park.", "You are better off. Instead of helping you through a tough time she is being selfish and only worried about herself. You probably just dodged a big bullet.", "So sorry to hear about this... But you doged a bullet. If she can't stand by you in one of your weakest/sad times then what about other times ? Relationships aren't always rosy and passionate; you're not going to be 100% al the time. This is normal.

Seems like you are better off, best of luck to you and Mila going forward :)", "Awww, God Bless You, I am sorry for the end of your relationship but I know people hate when people say this but I genuinely do  feel its for the best. NTA. Good luck to you and your Dad.", "so, a person who is losing his father is, according to her, not allowed to be \"less passionate\". that\u00b4s a really monstrous thing to say.she has zero empathy.  you are lucky she is removing herself from your life.", "Right? He\u2019s not as \u201cpassionate and engaged\u201d as he was before his DAD WAS PUT IN THE HOSPITAL?! (In a way that sounds fairly terminal, though I hope he recovers.) Gee, I wonder why? Must be the dog\u2019s fault I guess? (I\u2019m replying to you bc I didn\u2019t even realize this side of it until your comment about her lack of empathy to his situation.) \n\nOP dodged a major bullet with Ellen, as hard as breakups are.

Rehoming or giving an older pet to a shelter would be so cruel.  Ellen doesn't sound like a person with any empathy for your difficult situation.  It sounds like she can't handle life changes.  It hurts, no doubt, but in the long run she doesn't sound like a person who can handle life and changes and wants to be the center of all your attention.  That pup and your dad will be forever grateful for what you did.", "Sorry this ended your relationship but I agree with your choice.", "Really sorry to hear this, OP.

Ellen wanted a relationship with a person that would devote all of their attention to her and that she could control.  Mila's arrival and your unwillingness to give in to her demands made it clear to her that you were not that person.  The only way to maintain the relationship would have been to give into her demands now and forever.
