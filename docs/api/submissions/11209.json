UPDATE", "selftext": "Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bl9ka/wibta_if_i_kept_my_dads_dog_against_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nSo I guess it's customary to give an update on these things, and since a few people started following me after my previous post I figured I ought to finish the story. It's only been a few days but a lot has happened\n\nEllen finally agreed to meet up earlier today. Ironically, though people were telling me to break up with her, she beat me to the punch. We talked over coffees for a few hours, and what many of you suggested was true - her real reason for not wanting to keep Mila was separate from all of the ones she offered me. She said that she thinks I've just changed too much since we got her, and when I asked what she meant she stated that I'm \"less passionate and engaged with her than before\". I don't really know if I can do anything with that, whether it's to do with the stress of my father's condition or not, but she basically said I'm not the person she fell in love with anymore. She's packing up her things even as I type this. It's hard in a way I can't describe, like all of a sudden I'm losing all of the people I love. But I also know that I can't control her decision to leave if that's what she wants\n\nIn brighter news, Mila is doing well. Some of you were concerned that Ellen might 'spirit her away', but she's still very much around. I brought her to the hospital park area to see my dad and she was over the moon to be with him again, so I'll probably keep that up as long as he's able. I've also taken up the recommendations to find a doggy daycare for the days I'm in the office. I'll start dropping her off there next week, and if all goes well I'm sure she'll make plenty of friends\n\nThere isn't much else to say, other than thank you. There's been an enormous amount of love and support coming from this subreddit, people were sending dozens of heartfelt messages (I even had to turn my phone off because all the notifications were too much of a distraction at work). I wanted to let you know all your kind words mean so much to me, even if I felt a little too awkward to respond to most of the messages. It's a strange and difficult time all around for Mila and I, but we'll try and navigate it as best we can\n\n\nThat's all, I suppose.

This sounds a lot me like her expecting you to put her before literally everything, even when she didn\u2019t object to what you told her before she moved in, and even when she knows you are losing your dad and Mila is a part of your dad. As much as it hurts right now, honestly? She\u2019s showing you who she is - she is showing you that she isn\u2019t up for any kind of flexibility when things get hard or sad. I know it\u2019s hard now, but in the end, think about things like having kids with her and so on - if she thinks the dog is disruptive and reduces direct engagement and passion, just wait until she has a kid (and no, becoming a parent doesn\u2019t mean you are no longer an individual with wants and needs, but it does mean that you have to be flexible and willing to reprioritize at times).", "I just wanted to say that you're absolutely doing the right thing, and I wish you and Mila the very best. \n\nYou're a great person, and your ex just wasn't able to see that, and that's her loss. \n\nHopefully you find someone more understanding and less selfish in the future.", "Kudos to you for keeping your promise to your dad.\n\nHonestly, her \"real\" reason for breaking up, sounds no more thought out /honest than the original litany of reasons why you were bad for agreeing to adopt the dog in the first place.\n\nBest of luck in all things, going forward.   There will be a lot of women out there, who are honest, and will find your dedication to the dog / your dad endearing.", "I am so happy for Mila's visit to your dad, i can imagine how much they missed eachother.\n\nAnd i know you feel sad, you did have feelings for Ellen and those cannot dissapear just because you broke up.\n\nHer reason is weird in a way - even kids, longer hours at work, a stressful period of time, an illness, any of this appear in real life and she wasn\u2019t ready to share nor support.\n\nBut you will be fine. You are a good, strong person and things will improve.", "Dog pic tax... Pay up.", "So she never thought that maybe you're currently not \"passionate and engaged\" because you're losing your father? I know this hurts, but you will be much better in the long run without this selfish \"partner\".", "Sad to say that I think we saw this coming, but it\u2019s probably for the best, OP. \n\nI\u2019m glad Mila is doing well and that she got to visit your dad! Sending you and your family much love and hugs.", "I'm sorry this didn't go better, OP. But you and Mila can be there for each other, and someday you will find a better match. <3", "I'm honestly just not sure how to upload them, AITA doesn't allow image additions", "upload to imgur and share link here", "https://imgur.com/a/CXbktfh hopefully that works. Mila guarding a ball from the pup of one of my dad's friends (who will remain covered, for privacy reasons)", "that's a good pupper!"]}
