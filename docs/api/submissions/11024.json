You don\u2019t have to cook for him at all.  If he doesn\u2019t like what you\u2019re willing to cook, he can cook or buy his own food with his own damn money.  I would also reconsider a relationship with him because this sounds like textbook abusive controlling behavior.", "NTA\n\nThis is abusive behavior and you should get out of that situation asap", "NTA. Not in the slightest. If he has all day to sleep and play games he surely has time to take out the beef or make his own food. Does he have a job or something during the day other than sleeping?", "NTA.

My roommates only know how to make simple meals (mac-n-cheese, spaghetti, grilled cheese sandwiches, eggs, and hamburgers) or they just eat fast food. They complain about wanting to eat healthier and how their diet is aggravating medical conditions they have and wasting money. It's not really their fault because their parent's either feed them pet food, burnt food, or fast food. They have no idea how anything works in the kitchen.\nI also have medical conditions and can not eat the same thing everyday unless it's soup. I am mainly self taught in the kitchen and my mother cooked a lot as well. I offered to meal plan/prep/cook if they are willing to do the dishes, go half on the groceries, learn, and also help with prepping the ingredients (cutting vegetables, pulling out the meat, and monitor the food if I have to leave the kitchen.) \nI am not their parent or personal chef. I am also not in a romantic relationship with them. They are my best friends but I am not going to do all the work if I don't want or have to. There are days where I just do not feel like cooking, to be honest I hate cooking, so I have them fend for themselves or cook dinner on their own, only coming to me with questions. It was a chore i was forced to do in my family of 6 for years. I absolutely hate cooking all the time. Granted though, I have been having fun expanding their tastes and exploring new recipes and cooking styles.\nYou are not the asshole. The least he could do is defrost the meat. Hell, make him do the clean up after. Cooking is hard work and time consuming, just for it to be gone in 10 mins or less.

But \u201cdethaw\u201d means to freeze.", " NTA.  Always have ingredients for a grilled cheese and then that is something he can make for himself in about 5 min.  Everyone needs to quit ordering food especially if they have low funds.", "NTA. Big time NTA! Unless I\u2019ve been dethawing meat incorrectly for the last couple decade, it\u2019s a passive activity\u2026 I just pull it out of the freezer and put it in the fridge or on the counter.

If you're doing this by yourself anyway, why do you need him?", "There\u2019s no way this is actually real, no one could actually act like that and still respect themselves. Obviously NTA.
