Let's say that that she brought OP to a horrible doctor who gave horrible medical advice and she was just following his bad advice. And because this doctor was so terrible, that also explains why OPs medical records don't match mom's story. The medical records say that her condition was much more mild than what the mother says. So maybe the doctor lied to the mother and this was like an insurance scam or something.\n\nSo the mother is under the belief that her daughter had a very serious problem in her foot that required surgical correction.... and *she expects the daughter to hide this from her current podiatrist*. WHY\u203d\u203d\u203d If the daughter had had such serious foot problems that surgery was required, that's even MORE reason to give the doctor that medical history\n\nA mother who simply cares about their child's health and well-being and is prioritising that doesn't advocate hiding relevant medical history from a doctor. Especially if that relevant medical history is as serious as the mother claims.\n\nMom wouldn't want that hidden from the current doctor unless she KNEW that it wasn't actually medically indicated. And every bit of knowledge we have in this story indicates that. The medical records don't back mom up and seemingly don't indicate that surgery is necessary. Mom wants the surgery hidden from current doctors and is extremely defensive about it. \n\n>> In some ways I feel like my mom wanted me to \u201cfix\u201d the flat feet because they did make it difficult for me to wear \u201cgirly\u201d shoes and they didn\u2019t look \u201cnormal\u201d and I was a major tomboy.\n\n> That's you projecting a whole lot of other issues onto this.\n\nHow on Earth do you read this as projection? OP has in no way indicated that she didn't feel normal or that she wanted to wear girly shoes. OP says that she was a tomboy and it's very clear that she's quoting or paraphrasing things her mother has previously said to her.\n\nSo even without the context of the medical records not matching the mother's story and without the mother expecting the daughter to lie to her doctor.... this doesn't read as projection. And with that context?? \n\nHonestly your answer sounds like it's coming from a parent who is perhaps defensive about their own stuff and is projecting the pressures they feel to be a \"perfect parent\" onto a totally unrelated story. I can give the no parent is perfect speech a million times but it doesn't apply to so so so many situations.\n\nExpecting your child to lie to the doctors about their medical history in order to cover for you is way way way past \"no parent is perfect\". \n\nExpecting your child to lie to you about her current medical issues to protect your feelings? That's way way past \"no parent is perfect\". If I followed doctor's advice with regards to my own child and then years later it turned out my child was experiencing negative consequences of that, my concern would be comforting my child and supporting her.  \n\nImagine that your child comes to you with devastating medical news. Your child is living with excruciating pain on a daily basis and the only solution is an invasive and difficult medical procedure that will leave her with a significant mobility impairment that she will have to learn how to navigate. And on top of that your child is dealing with the emotional pain of knowing that this would not have been necessary if she had not gotten an unnecessary surgery as a child. So your daughter is dealing with all of that physical and emotional pain and trauma and you want your daughter to lie to you to protect your own feelings? To protect you from feeling any guilt over medical decisions you made for her? Especially if you made those decisions with her health and well-being in mind and we're literally just following doctors instructions.... why do you need to be protected? Yes, finding out that something you did to protect someone ended up harming them sucks. It's devastating. Absolutely. But you know who is more impacted by this situation and more devastated? The person who is actually going through it. The person who has to live daily with the consequences. The daughter. I would be horrified if my child felt that she had to hide what she was going through to protect me. Especially if I had any hand in her suffering, no matter how unintentional. I would expect her to tell me and I wouldn't punish her for it or blame her in any way. my job would be to support her and comfort her and answer any questions that she had. I would tell her what I was told by the doctor, and why we chose the doctor and I would help her get old medical records if she needed them. if she wanted to research the standard of care at the time or if she wanted to research the doctor I would help her do that and I would support her in that. Because even if every single person in this chain was doing their absolute best to protect and help her - she was still failed. And whether she was failed by a parent, or a doctor, or an insurance policy, or the medical standards of the time - she was still failed. She was failed in a painful and permanent way. And it would be my job to help and support her through that - not the other way around. Even if I was not one of the people who had failed her, it would still be my job to support her through that because she's my fucking daughter.\n\nA \"not perfect\" parent who did the best they could would not expect their child to conceal important medical history from their doctor. A \"not perfect\" parent who did the best they could wouldn't be angry at their child telling them their current medical problems and what caused them. A \"not perfect\" parent wouldn't expect their child to hide things from them to protect them.\n\nAnd all evidence in this story points to Mom forcing a medically unnecessary procedure on her child for aesthetic reasons. But even if it didn't, and even if she was just genuinely doing the absolute best that she could? The daughter is still NTA", "You\u2019re reacting like OP told her mother \u201cYou know that surgery you made me get?
