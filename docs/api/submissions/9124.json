Specially in the richer areas of the world.", "Maybe not as much now but it might have been easier to convince a doctor 40 years ago. \nAlso mothers with munchausen by proxy convince doctors to give children unnecessary treatment (and sometimes surgery) and while not common it happens way more than it should.", "Some people might have seen them as a health issue, but I just got snarky, \"My grandma always said flat feet were a sign of laziness.\" My doctor said they'd be fine and to leave it alone.  Some docs may have advised for it, but I know it bothered my mom because it wasn't \"right\".", "How is she an asshole? The surgery she got when she was a child is directly linked to the issues she\u2019s having now. There is a GREAT chance that there was nothing wrong with her, as she says that photos and medical claims don\u2019t fully support her mothers reasoning, also all she said was that she mentioned how this surgery has affected her too this day, she currently has to live with this pain and the unfortunate reality she may not be able to walk, but she\u2019s the asshole? Reading y\u2019alls comments sometimes literally kills me because in no way or world, is this person the asshole.", "Do you think the A H move was telling the mother what the doctor said or that OP told the doctor her medical history?   Because either one is pretty crazy.  If the mother can\u2019t handle reality, then I guess talking to her should be treated like talking to a small child.  If you are saying that telling the doctor such relevant medical history is wrong, then I don\u2019t even know what to say to that.  Is OP just supposed to suffer in silence to avoid upsets her mother?   As a parent, you do the best you can with what you know, but getting all butthurt because it didn\u2019t work out is incredibly childish and selfish of the mother.  I would expect that the mother\u2019s reaction is just the tip of the iceberg of shitty behavior.  NTA", "And obviously we can\u2019t know for sure but not doing the surgery probably would\u2019ve also caused you issues down the line. Source: I had flat feet the never got fixed and have no had 8 surgeries (and counting) to try to fix things that the flat feet caused.", "My spouse is recovering from surgery on their foot 4 months ago for the worst calcifications their doctor had ever seen in their Achilles. They had to have their Achilles removed from their heel bone, all the calcifications and dead tissue taken out, their heel bone shaved and reshaped, and their Achilles reattached Remarkably, the doctor said this whole situation was exacerbated by an arch that was falling and causing an abnormal shearing on their Achilles. \n\nFeet especially are weird. I worked in health care for almost 25 years, and I have seen some awful feet for various reasons. People with flat feet are usually encouraged to get them treated in some form or another because it can cause ankle, knee, hip, and in serious cases back pain. Whether it be with physical therapy, shoe inserts, braces, or surgery.\n\nAlthough this issue may be a direct result of the surgery for OP, there is no way to know if her flat feet wouldn't cause the same or different issues. Mom was probably basing her decision on doctors' advice and not for malicious reasons. Most (not all) parents try to do what is best for their kids. Surgery is not an easy thing to subject your child to. \n\nOP has a right to be upset that she is in pain and has to have surgery. However, unless there is some type of abuse that OP is leaving out, I would have to say that OP, YTA for blaming this on your mom, even though I understand you being upset and scared at the prospect of surgery and for being in pain (the pain from this is no joke. My spouse suffered from it for 8 yrs before agreeing to surgery).", "NAH for every reason you listed, honestly. Like I don't think either of them are *wrong*, just... really sad for both of them tbh :(", "But, all I said to her was the surgery 40 years ago is the cause of what I\u2019m dealing with now. I didn\u2019t tell her it was her fault or anything. Do I think a different choice could have been made then, yes. But I didn\u2019t verbalize that to her. \n\nEveryone seems to agree though, so next time something like this comes up, I guess I\u2019ll just lie to her so her feelings don\u2019t get hurt by a fact.", "But, I didn\u2019t. I told her that the surgery 40 years ago is the cause of my current issues. While I do privately feel she could have made a different choice, I have never verbalized that, except I did say \u201cthe surgery you made me get\u201d at one point in the conversation with her, after she started saying it was rude to bring it up 40 years later.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t want anything from her. My medical insurance will pay the whole cost. And I\u2019m already on federal disability (for other issues) so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s lost wages to worry about.", "Um, a podiatrist is an MD.", "Now we know that the condition can range from completely innocuous to extremely painful and can require surgery. You can be born this way, or develop it later in life, or as a result of an injury or condition. Go figure.", "I had to do those exercises, too. My feet got so nimble that I could write  with them. Didn't fix my feet, though. It freaks my husband out that I can stand on the outsides of my feet.", "I'm going to make my daughter watch the dog and if anything happens I'll blame her and they won't be my problem anymore.\"", "Asshole in this case is just a matter of right and wrong not being a literal asshole", "Fellow Gen X, here.\n\nMy sister was permanently disabled in a car crash when she was laying in the back window of our station wagon at the age of 2.\n\nEvery time I mention it, all the millenials and gen z's freak out about how irresponsible it was and such, and even some other gen x freak out, but like... everyone rode like that back then. They didn't even have proper car seats, and very rarely did people use the precursors to them, which were all found to be more dangerous than using nothing! \n\n(She's fine btw, it's a minor disability, but I'm saying more about the judgements we make with hindsight, lol)", "\"The surgery you made me get\" is not the same as stating a fact, because of the \"you made me\" part. For example, \"the calcifications are a result of the surgery I had as a child\" doesn't affix blame in the same way.\n\nIt's not that you have to lie, but there are ways of stating things that are more sensitive than others.\n\nIt sounds like this is an understandably sensitive issue for you, and you are probably really angry that this has happened to you. Your mother probably also feels badly. Does it fix anything to assign blame at this point though?\n\nI feel for you though. I have some similar issues regarding my own mother and my health issues, and I definitely felt better about them when I saw my mother though compassionate rather than judgmental eyes.", "Well, the inserts don't fix the problem, they just help the feet be in a more normal position when walking. They are expensive,  insurance doesn't cover them, and every time you grow, you need a new pair. If they aren't made properly  (because thry are custom made for your feet), they can make things worse. Source: person with the same feet as you.", "It's really easy to look back 40 years after the fact and imagine what could have been done differently. \n\nBut, I mean, mother's obsess over every little decision they make for their kids. And then they feel guilty wondering if they did the right thing. Mom guilt can be crushing. \n\nI have no idea if you needed that surgery, or if there was some other option they could have done first, or if you did need the surgery and the guy just messed it up, or if there really was just nothing anyone could have done. Be frustrated at the doctor then. \n\nI do know that you are directing your annoyance at the literal one person who had no way to know though. And if it's coming across here, it probably came across when you talked to your mom about it. \n\nYou keep emphasizing that she made you get this surgery. But like, that's not how medical procedures work. She didn't see your feet slightly off and then drive to hospital and demand surgery. This isn't foot binding. This is a real medical procedure that's still performed currently, by the way. It has prerequisites. Surgeons don't just cut on 6 year olds because their moms say so. \n\nI'm not suggesting you needed to lie to your mom. But at least give credit where credit is due. The doctors told your mother you needed the surgery. The doctors may have been wrong. Your mom did the best she could with the information she had. \n\nAgain, if you're upset about some other ways that she didn't allow you to express yourself, I would encourage you to speak openly about that with her separately of this. That would give her the opportunity to actually express remorse over something she may have actually done and had control over, rather than this, which she really didn't.", "We all feel in the comments that you resent your mom for it. It was the decision of a professional (a doctor), not your mom. Your resentment is displaced. \n\nIf we feel it then your mom does too. \n\nYTA", "It\u2019s weird that people are saying there is no way the dr just did what your mom wanted, there are tons of unethical doctors and really crazy/shitty parents. I\u2019ll assume you feel this way for a reason and believe it because I have parents like this. I don\u2019t think you the asshole. I think it\u2019s telling your mom is offended you shared your medical history with your doctor.", "I don't know about the trust reddit has with doctors. Doctors are human and make mistakes, they aren't omniscient. Some doctors lose their licenses for suggesting unnecessary surgeries either because they are surgery crazy or want to make money and commit fraud. There are so many cases documented and tried. Surgery should always be the last resort. She should have asked for a second opinion and also talked to you first. You're NTA.", "Are we\u2026not supposed to be able to stand like that?

I had repeated ear infections and had lost most of my hearing prior to lancing. If it hadn't been done at that time, the hearing loss would have been permanent. The lancing procedure was before ear tubes that they tend to do now.", "No. I think you guys really just enjoy painting people who are in vulnerable spaces as assholes, because that\u2019s what majority of these comments are. People bring their stories and their experiences, and this one in particular, no way she\u2019s an asshole. Her experiences and feelings about the stuff she has to deal with for the rest of her life due to a surgery her mom got her for as a child, does not make her an asshole. \nEven with her feelings of thinking her mom may have done this out of an ulterior motive, because she knows her mom a lot better than you do, she\u2019s not an asshole because she didn\u2019t even necessarily blame her mom. All she did was state facts, and for her mom to say that it was UNNECESSARY for her to bring up past surgeries to her DOCTOR, that is something that people with a lot of shame and something to hide say. \nY\u2019all paint people in really horrible light when in reality, this person has ever right to feel the way they feel.", "I don\u2019t think you understand what I said OP is not A asshole but on this sub the bar for right and wrong is based on the term asshole \n\nAlso medical advice 40 years ago is vastly different than medical advice today"]}
