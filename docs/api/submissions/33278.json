{"id": 33278, "submission_id": "18l7q59", "title": "AITA for updating my will to award my less successful son a higher share of my assets?", "selftext": "I (66f) have two children, Benjamin (36m), and Jack (33m).\n\nJack is in a good place in his life. He has a good job with a senior position in his industry, a longterm fianc\u00e9e, a wide circle of friends, and whilst they're still renting, they're both currently saving for a house deposit.\n\nBenji on the other hand, despite being the oldest, has not done as well in life. Benji has never had a girlfriend (or a boyfriend), and has no friends that he visits. He did give university a try, but left both times in his first year due to anxiety. Today he chooses not to work. Benji and I have been living alone together for the last 6 years now and I support him financially. I know that the situation is not ideal, however I've long since come to terms with the fact that Benji is a square peg trying to fit into a world of round holes, and as I'm getting older I'm happy for his company. It's an arrangement that suits us both. \n\nI'm starting to get on in years and recently my thoughts have turned to my children and what they will do after I'm gone. A few months ago I decided to update my will, and asked Jack for a meeting to address the changes. I let him know that in my updated will almost all of my assets, both cash and property will going to Benji, however I'll be giving him a cash amount to help with his house deposit (\u00a310,000). My reasoning for this is that I know full well Jack is capable of looking after himself after I am gone, but without assistance Benji will always struggle. He is simply never going to have what Jack has.\n\nJack did not take kindly to the news. He said that I'm effectively punishing him for having succeeded in life, where his brother has been allowed to not try and fail his entire life, and is now being rewarded for \"choosing to remain a neat so he can suckle on mummies teat\". He said some more unkind things about his brother and at that stage I said that it was better that he leave until he could calm himself down. On the way out the door he told me that this was not about money or assets, but was yet another instance of me \"favouring\" and \"coddling\" Benji the way \"I have done his entire life\" (not true) and claimed we were in an \"emotionally incestuous relationship\". I told him to get out. \n\nThis all went down 3 months ago and since then Jack will no longer accept my calls. He ignored my 66th birthday outright, not even a card, and at this stage I am not expecting to see him at all for Christmas, so it's going to be just me and Benji as usual. \n\nOther family members have since became aware of the drama and are telling me that my decision is wrong and that by doing this I am driving a wedge further between Jack and Benji when their relationship is already strained. AM I THE ASSHOLE for my decision? I love both my children equally, but I can't go to my grave knowing that Benji will be out on the streets suffering without me. I KNOW that Jack will NEVER have to struggle in the same way Benji has, so I don't know why he even needs the money in the first place. I am frankly disgusted by his greed and lack of concern for his brother's future.", "created_utc": 1702903154, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18l7q59/aita_for_updating_my_will_to_award_my_less/", "score": 2185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You casually say that it\u2019s \u201cnot true\u201d that you have favoured or coddled Benji his entire life, but is it? I wonder, and I suspect there\u2019s more than an argument to suggest that you HAVE favoured him over Jack over a long period of time.\n\nOne consideration that people should keep in mind, however, is exactly what Benji does whilst living at home. Does he shop for groceries, cook, clean, handle DIY, do the gardening or such? As you grow older and may need more assistance, is Benji capable of being your full-time carer and would he be willing to act as such?\n\nIf he does none of those things and won\u2019t be your carer in future, then you are absolutely coddling him and it has got to stop.\n\nIf he\u2019s doing all the chores, keeping you company and would care for you full-time in the case of illness, then that may deserve some small element of favouritism in your estate. It does not, however, deserve everything bar \u00a310000 - that\u2019s preposterous.\n\nWhy not consider some compromises? For example, as Benji has no friends or partner, could you rejig the estate to buy a small flat for him now, and get him used to living alone etc? Then when you pass away, your home could be sold with the profits, and any other remaining assets, split between both Jack and Benji.\n\nThat way, Benji gets a stable manageable home and some money to live on, and Jack gets more than a \u00a310k payment.", "YTA. Complete AH, you can't give one child more because the other became self-sufficient. You picked a favorite. That's how your son Jack feels.\n\nWhat makes you think Benji will make good choices after you pass just because you gave him everything?", "YTA. Jack is totally right. Jack didn't become successful magically. He worked hard for it. It's not his fault that his brother couldn't achieve anything of his own. You're not realising it, but you are indeed favouring Benji over Jack.", "YTA \n\nYou are awarding the lazy son and punishing the successful son. Their inheritance should  be equal.\n\nNot only that, but by already supporting him, he is already getting way more.", "YTA.\n\nIs the amount you\u2019re leaving Benji so much that he is set for life and doesn\u2019t have to lift a finger to live? If not then whether you equally divided your estate or not, Benji is headed towards a destiny of being homeless and no amount of money or assets will change that.\n\nInstead you just burnt your relationship with Jack.", "I think you and Benji are in a codependent relationship and by sheltering him you are depriving him of possibilities to grow as a person. He could take measures to find ways for himself to be successful in his own ways. The world is not black and white and even as a square peg there are plenty of opportunities. But I guess for you the current arrangement is just too cosy\u2026\nJack is right, YTA.", "YTA. Your relationship does sound emotionally incestuous. You have likely lost Jack but you don't care, do you? As long as you have Benji.", "You may mean well, but sadly, YTA.  Life has a way of throwing us all curve-balls, and who knows what Jack or his family may need in the future.  Would you be happy going to your grave knowing you gave everything to Benji and Jack and your potential grandchildren will struggle if he loses his job, becomes ill, or faces any number of setbacks?  If you love your children equally, you would leave your estate to them equally.  Try and help Benji to plan for the future so that when you are gone he can live independently and know where to get assistance if he needs it.  We never know what our future holds.", "YTA. And I know what I'm talking about. My mum is doing the same thing to me. In fact, I no longer have contact with my sibling because of this. My relationship with mum is barely existing. Think carefully if you want Jack to stay in your life.", "Does Benji really have a disability or a crippling condition that would prevent him from even having a low stress job? I would think some kind of job is possible and honestly, would be beneficial for his mental health and sense of purpose. By enabling him to not work, live with little responsibilities, and have no social support outside you are not preparing him for life without you. You will not live forever and he can\u2019t be a shut in. He will mentally spiral. Think of setting up your adult child for success. If he has a disability or neurodivergent variation, you absolutely should be doing thing, and even more so if he is neurotypical. YTA for treating your kids so differently and not even trying to help Benji.", "YTA. \n\nI was the sibling who worked harder, sacrificed a lot, and subsequently achieved more. Meanwhile, my sister lived in the moment and made stupid decisions. Instead of being rewarded for my good choices, SHE was showered with attention, support, and money for her lousy ones. \n\nEventually went LC with family and left that toxicity behind. Jack would be wise to do the same.", "INFO: Does Benji have any diagnosed mental or physical conditions that prevent him from working?", "YTA and jack is right", "YTA you are penalizing Jack for actually being self sufficient and taking care of himself.  Meanwhile your son who doesn\u2019t work or support himself gets rewarded for his laziness.  You say you don\u2019t have favorites but you do and it\u2019s Benji.\n\nYou know Benji will probably just blow thru what you leave him quickly.", "It\u2019s your money and you get to decide how to allocate it. That being said, you have to realize the fallout you are causing by the allocation you\u2019re choosing. Jack probably already has feelings about you 100% financially supporting Benji for the duration of his life so far, how capable he thinks Benji could be at supporting himself if he had to, and your choice to be totally ok to continue financially supporting him even after you die. From a parental point of view I totally understand you wanting to make sure both of your kids are taken care of after you are gone but it\u2019s easy to see why Jack would feel he\u2019s being punished for being a capable adult, especially if he thinks Benji is just living it up with you and not being expected to try anything to build himself up to being a functional and self sufficient adult. Giving all of your assets to Benji minus $10,000 is a statement. It would be different if you divided your assets even a little more fairly (Ex 75% to Benji, 25% to Jack). You\u2019ve said Benji has anxiety and chooses not to work - does he have a therapist? Is he working towards anything like being able to go out and make friends or get a job? Has he been diagnosed with anything? If the answer to all of those questions are no, it paints a clearer picture of how Jack could really feel thar you have favouritism for Benji. Also, would the money for Benji be in a trust or something that could pay him out monthly or would he just be receiving all of your money in a big chunk? What\u2019s stopping him from blowing it instead of using it to provide the necessities for himself? Is all of your assets/savings (minus $10,000 for Jack) feasibly enough to provide for Benji for the rest of his life? I think you really just need to think your choice through. It\u2019s your money so I don\u2019t think YTA strictly for allocating it how you want, but I think YWBTA if you don\u2019t truly think through how it\u2019s going to effect your current relationships with your sons, the future relationship of your sons, and ultimately what\u2019s best for Benji and his life long term.", "YTA I love both my children equally, I just love one more equally than the other.", "Info: are you prepared for the consequences of Benji being 100% responsible for arranging your senior and end of life care?", "YTA. Benji has needed a kick up the ass for years now, and you've just kept giving him more padding for the diapers so he doesn't feel it. Grow a pair and tell your baby boy that he needs to get a life. \n\nA friend of mine, 'KS' is a very successful businessman. His only sister is on her 3rd marriage, has 4 kids and can't hold a job.\n\nKS helped his parents out-a lot. When they got hit hard by the financial crash in 2008, he kept their home from going into foreclosure, paid off the mortgage and their cars and credit cards etc. The only mistake he made was putting the house and cars etc in his father's name-mainly for the sake of his father's pride.\n\nLong story short-his father died a couple years ago. Guess what? The house is re-mortgaged, mom is up to her eyeballs in debt because she's fully supporting the sister and her family with the money KS has provided. The worst part is that mom just told KS that she's changed her will to leave everything to his sister, because 'you're so successful you don't need the money'. He is beyond devastated, and furious because IT'S ALL HIS MONEY.\n\nOP is enabling his son's unwillingness to take responsibility for any area of his life, and plans to continue to fund it once he's gone. I don't blame Jack for cutting dad off-I would too. It isn't greed on Jack's part, it feels more like sadness and hurt.", "Mom? Is that you?\n\nIf so.\n\nYou coddled \u201cBenji\u201d no matter how many times he f\u2019d up. He never tried. Because he knew you would give him anything he asked for.\n\nI was never given that grace. You expected me to find my own way, while you knocked down every obstacle for him because he was your precious child. \n\nIt\u2019s not the money. It\u2019s that, once again, you blatantly show you don\u2019t give a shit.\n\nBenji is going to blow through that cash on drugs and god knows what else in weeks. Your house will be foreclosed on. But you still have to do it anyway. \n\nOh, by the way, YTA.", "YTA\n\nthe fair thing to do is to split your estate evenly.\n\nYou are coddling one son over the other, I suspect jack has a point about favouritism. Emotionally incestuous sounds pretty fair comment. \n\nI guarantee 2 years after you have gone the inheritance will be gone he will be homeless and begging Jack to help him. Help that is not going to come!\n\nYou know full well that \u00a310k is no where near enough for a deposit on a property in the UK. You have pretty much cut your son off.\n\nSplit it equally and put Benji's share in a trust fund so he cant waste it and your other son won't hate you or his brother. \n\nYTA", "YTA.\nIf anything, Jack should get more. You have already been giving more to Benji in your day-to-day life.\n\nSort this out ASAP if you want contact with Jack. He is pissed, and it is understandable.", "This is a complicated situation, but you asked for a black and white ruling, so...YTA.\n\nYou make it clear that you have always given Benji more than Jack. As Jack noted--not just money, but time and attention. It's VERY difficult for a child to say out loud, \"mom, I don't feel like you love me,\" so they often use anger to cover the fear and vulnerability. When Jack says \"you are coddling Benji,\" under that is the statement \"you have always given Benji more time and attention than me, and I've been hurting my whole life.\"\n\nTwo words: START THERAPY. You clearly love both your children, value them both, and want them both to feel loved and supported. Your actions are communicating something different. Going to therapy will help you understand how to show Jack the love that you feel for him without abandoning Benji.", "INFO: Has Benji been diagnosed with any conditions?  Has he pursued treatment for them and sincerely tried to improve his health so that he is able to care for himself?", "YTA\n\nAnd if Benji's future is your biggest problem - well, you just guaranteed that Jack will never help his brother, even when Benji loses his ineritance and ends up  on the streets.", "YTA\n\nthis is bigger than money.  This is making one son feel that that there is an imbalance and the other son is favored and loved more than him!   Do you comprehend the level of hurt you are inflicting on your other son!!", "YTA\n\nOne of your children sacrificed, followed your advice, the rules and did everything he was asked by society.\n\nYour reward to him is to give him less and make him feel like you loved him less and are less proud of him.\n\nDivide your estate evenly between your children, unless you want one to always feel less loved by you and forever ruin any chance of them being loving siblings.", "If Benji is so incapable then put that money in a trust fund, so he gets enough to survive. If he's so inept in life, how can you trust him with large sums of money?", "the only reasons why you could do this is because benjamin is either\n\n1. there for you when you need them and meaningfully supports you\n\n2. acts as your care worker and thus making it possible for you to spend a comfortable life\n\nor\n\n3. jack has cut you out (before the incident)\n\n1 & 2 would mean rewarding benjamin for his effort in caring for you. while 3 would be you and jack reckoning with the broken relationship you have and finally cutting the line\n\notherwise, yes you are disproportionately rewarding benjamin for failing and punishing jack for succeeding.", "YTA\nJack is right, you\u2019re punishing one son for succeeding while awarding the other for doing nothing. Even if you thought you were helping benjamin, this is not a viable solution. If he inherits everything he can keep himself warm for a short while, but how is he going to make it when the inheritance dwindles out?\nIf I were your son I would cut contact too.", "YTA, you mollycoddled  and favoured the less successful son all his life and now, just to make sure your other son definitely knows how insignificant he is, you also leave him less.... Wow.....", "YTA - It's the *\"Today he chooses not to work.\"* that put the nail in the coffin for me. If he works as your caretaker or in any other way works for you, that's one thing. But supporting him without expecting anything in return is what is making him incapable of supporting himself.", "YTA. The reason Benji has failed his whole life is because he knows he doesn\u2019t actually have to do anything. You\u2019ll just take care of him. If you really wanted to help him, you\u2019d be preparing him for living without you. You\u2019d be dropping the safety net and making him get a job or some form of training that will allow him to get a job. Jack is successful because he knew from the start that you would never help him the way you\u2019ve done Benji. You are rewarding laziness that you fostered. And don\u2019t give me that \u2018oooo what would you do\u2019 nonsense. I have two boys, and they are treated equally. If one was struggling I\u2019d help him find the problem and fix it, not let him stop trying. Because it\u2019s your fault Benji has stopped trying; he knows he doesn\u2019t need to with your money to take care of him.", "Maybe if you hadn\u2019t coddled Benji his entire life and taught him how to be self sufficient none of you would be in this position. Right now your family is absolutely correct - you are driving a wedge in their relationship. You are wrong and you are the asshole for this decision. \nYou deserve Jack ignoring you. At this point you\u2019ll be lucky to get an invite to the wedding and/or the chance to see future grandchildren. \nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYour eldest has leeched off of you for years and you've allowed \"Benji\" to use you while you probably neglected \"Jack\" because he's so independent and so capable of looking after himself.\n\nYou don't love your children equally.

He's done with being second best to his older brother.\n\nYou may be 66 but it's time to grow the fuck up and accept that your youngest wants nothing to do with you because of your own actions.\n\nEdited: I got heated - not \"Benji\"'s fault his mother failed him as a parent.", "Because Jack worked hard and made something of his life you're annoyed he doesn't need you like Benji does so he gets 10K \\[and don't kid yourself this is a reasonable house deposit - it isn't - you know it's peanuts\\]  Instead you intend to make deadbeat Benji your sole beneficiary so he willl stay living with you until you die.\n\nBenji is with you because he cannot take care of himself - which you already know and condone. If he won the Lottery he'd be off like a shot, but if you are content buying your son's company that's your decision. However, changes are high Benji will p\\*\\*\\* through your money within a year and be knocking on Jack's door for help when he's broke because he's faaaamily.\n\nYou are reaping the rewards of really bad parenting.", "YTA, that would be punishing your successful son for his hardwork and good decision-making. And speaking from a Benji (my brother is much much more successful than me) I would feel so humiliated if after all the funeral processes are done, the will says I get more money because I'm more broke. Like... absolutely not. I want my brother to get 50% regardless of my success, wtf.", "YTA. Not just for the favouritism but for also setting Benji up for failure. Leaving him most of the money/assets won\u2019t make him a functioning adult and no doubt you\u2019d expect Jack to pick up the slack.", "Info: what do you expect to happen once Benji has spent his inheritance? He doesn't sound like he's making good decisions or someone who would invest wisely to live off the proceeds.", "YTA - for the history that has lead to this point, and your dismissal of your second sons legitimate feelings. \n\nHowever, what's done is done and Benji is very likely unable to care for himself. why not leave your assets in trust, appointing either trusted friends and family or a professional board of trustees. Make it a condition of the trust that Benji be allowed to remain in the house and his day to day expenses be provided for (maybe set a limit) until his passing, at which time the assets revert to Jack (or his survivors if he predeceases Benji).", "As a parent, how the actual fuck do you not see how much of an asshole you are. \n\nYTA hands down. \n\nYou are punishing your more successful son for being successful, you say you have not been coddling or favoring Benji, but you are literally footing all his bills, giving him a place to live in case you die, a nest egg for him to fall back on. Now your other son gets a measly 10,000 to pay for a down payment on a house. If I were him I'd be easily insulted by this and feel disrespected by you. \n\nAlso, there are so many fucking jobs out there for square people in a world full of round holes. Get him off his ass and working and to stop suckling. It's one thing him to live with you in this state of the economy while he tries to get on his feet but what you are doing is fully supporting everything.

If it\u2019s that severe, there may be a chance to get him on disability. I don\u2019t think people will understand if they haven\u2019t lived it.

Or, perhaps, should you be encouraging Benji to stretch himself to work towards some semblance of self-sufficiency, instead of just living unemployed in Mom\u2019s house forever?\n\nHonestly, your comments since have made it clear that Jack is probably spot on with his assessment.  It isn\u2019t about the money.  It\u2019s about enabling Benji to make decisions that hurt him and his growth.  I\u2019ve worked with adults with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities (aka IQs around 70) who are able to hold down service jobs for decades, despite that they will never be able to take care of themselves.

On the face of it and without knowing the intimate details, it feels like Jack\u2019s points are mostly valid - whilst the \u201cemotional incest\u201d line likey came from sheer anger, I completely see how he feels like his hard work and success are being effectively penalised, here.

Which is that its unfair that he is being punished because he dared to work hard and make something of himself.\n\nYour solution is problematic because it provokes conflict. It takes something away from someone to give to the other.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would consider a trust for Benji out of his half share of assets, with Jack and another trusted relative/friend as co-trustees. \n\nBenji would ideally stay in the same residence with Jack, or nearby for joint moral support. \n\nThe residue of the trust would go to your existing and future grandchildren. As it is unlikely that Benji would have children due to his anxiety and inability to make friends, Jack's children would most likely be the ultimate beneficiaries. \n\nThis is not legal advice and you are advised to consult a solicitor/advocate/lawyer or barrister in your jurisdiction.", "In my opinion, you are not the asshole.\n\nSeveral reason to support that call...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne: It is your money, your property, etc. You can do what you wish with your assets, fair or not, unless you're maliciously cutting someone out of your will, there should be no judgment about who you leave what to.\n\nTwo: Kind parenting is exceedingly rare in the US, and I am warmed to see that you take your role as a mother seriously. I personally view all of my children as my responsibility until the day I die; whether they succeed or fail may be a complicated matrix of factors that I play a heavy role in, but I cannot control everything they will experience or how the world will receive them. I know they all deserve love and safety for as long as I can provide both.\n\nTo that, I do not know enough about your situation to make an informed call as to the total justice in or appropriateness of your relationship with your oldest son. However, the world we live in is not kind to neurodivergent people and we have nothing in the way of social support or safety nets to help catch people who fail to launch in any meaningful or caring way. If one child has succeeded and another has failed, of course your resources should go towards supporting the child who is struggling.\n\nThree: The oldest child seems to harbor resentment not just towards his brother, but towards you. I imagine this stems from a sense of jealousy regarding what he mostly likely perceives as excess affection for his \"underachiever\" of a sibling, over himself. You will often hear people claim that \"love\" is the most powerful emotion humans feel, I will forever counter that resentment is, and the proof of that is in every divorce, most murders, and a great deal of global ugliness in general. I cannot conceive, given the tone of your post, that you have done much of anything to deserve such ire.\n\nAs such, you're not an asshole in any capacity, you're doing your best and not receiving the support you deserve in return for it. I hope your younger son comes around and realizes that his success in the world is the result of the platform you provided on top of his ability to carve out a little place where he can fit into society as a whole. FWIW, I would implore you not to actually punish him by removing him from your will altogether, which you might get the subtle compulsion to do, in response to this fit he's throwing. We never stop being our parents' children, no matter how old we get, and slights will always feel amplified from inside of that dynamic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Something I forgot to add... I would suggest rolling the older son's inheritance in some form of conservatorship, as he clearly lacks the life skills to manage property or income. Perhaps you could smooth things over with the other son by adjusting your will to leave the incapacitated son enough to comfortably live on, then the rest to the other son, and giving him oversight powers on the trust or whatever you set up?", "Yta", "I understand your reasoning and in a normal world this would be the way to go - you help more the people who need more help. \n\nAnd based on your sons reaction, l get that you feel this is him being greedy and narcissistic. \n\nBut it sounds like there is more behind it than just money. Preferential treatment has its long term consequences and the hurt can cause these kinds of reactions.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you love both of your sons equally if you dont treat them equally. This happens so often in families where the troubled kid or autistic kid gets so much more understanding and care than the kid that does well in school, career and life. Which results in those people hating their families and needing years of therapy. \n\nWith the changes in your will you are pretty much alienating one of your kids whilst you are still alive. You are showing him how doing well in your life is worth less than \"being the suffering artist\". And that will most likely result in the two brothers drifting further and further apart.... and the reason for it are your actions.\n\nMake this right if its not too late.", "NTA.

He has a good job with a senior position in his industry, a longterm fianc\u00e9e, a wide circle of friends, and whilst they're still renting, they're both currently saving for a house deposit.\n\nBenji on the other hand, despite being the oldest, has not done as well in life. Benji has never had a girlfriend (or a boyfriend), and has no friends that he visits. He did give university a try, but left both times in his first year due to anxiety. Today he chooses not to work. Benji and I have been living alone together for the last 6 years now and I support him financially. I know that the situation is not ideal, however I've long since come to terms with the fact that he's only a square peg trying to fit into a round hole, and as I'm getting older I'm happy for his company. It's an arrangement that suits us both. \n\nI'm starting to get on in years and recently my thoughts have turned to what the world is going to be like after I'm gone. A few months ago I decided to update my will, and asked Jack for a meeting to address the changes. I let him know that in my updated will almost all of my assets, both cash and property will going to Benji, however I'll be giving him a small cash amount to help with his house deposit (\u00a310,000). My reasoning for this is that I know Jack is capable of looking after himself after I am gone, but without assistance Benji will always struggle.\n\nJack did not take kindly to the news. He said that I'm effectively punishing him for having succeeded in life, where his brother has been allowed to not try and fail his entire life and is now being rewarded for it. He said some more unkind things about his brother and at that stage I said that it was better that he leave until he could calm himself down. On the way out the door he told me that this was not about money or assets, but was yet another instance of me \"favouring\" and \"coddling\" Benji the way \"I have done his entire life\" (not true) and claimed we were in an \"emotionally incestuous relationship\". I told him to get out. \n\nThis all went down 3 months ago and since then Jack will no longer accept my calls. He ignored my 66th birthday outright, not even a card, and at this stage I am not expecting to see him at all for Christmas, so it's going to be just me and Benji as usual. \n\nOther family members have since became aware of the drama and are telling me that my decision is wrong and that by doing this I am driving a wedge between Jack and Benji when their relationship is already strained. AM I THE ASSHOLE for my decision? I love both my children equally, but I can't go to my grave knowing that Benji will be out on the streets suffering without me. I KNOW that Jack will NEVER have to struggle in the same way Benji has, so I don't know why he even needs the money in the first place.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Look the truth is you came on here to say look at me I am a great mom and how dare the youngest child not see that I am doing all this for his brother. \n\nWhy do you think that once you are gone, and the house is gone, the money is gone and Jack has lost everything, (because he never learned how to take care of things) that he won't be homeless and on the street? Instead of saying I am going to leave 50 % to one son and 50% to the other with Ben being the executor of Jack's portion so that once you are gone he can teach him how to manage his home, his money, and himself. It is not wrong that you want to leave your home to your deadbeat son but why not teach him with the help of his brother how to move on once you are gone? \n\nYou will not be around to help him and it would be better for Jack to look at  Ben for guidance instead of Ben looking at Jack with disgust and never being a part of his life. The rift between the two is your fault only. To make sure that Jack is going to be okay in the end this needs to come from you. You do this by not giving all to Jack, who can't hold down a job, or a life without you helping him. You have taught Jack that he is different and can't live without you and that is wrong. \n\nYou will die, and Jack will have nothing and no one to be there for him through this difficult time.

You are doing your son no favors and He will most likely squander that money and still be left with nothing. \n\nYou are punishing your other son and when you do die those two brothers will probably have nothing to do with each other.

Like your kid, my parents knew that I didn't really fit in anywhere. Like you, they did much more for me than they did for my little sister for the longest time.

All it did, was show my sister that they loved me more.\n\nWe've banded together in a way where, if they decide to help me, they help my sister too. As siblings, we've had years of therapy to get us to a point where we can present a united front to our parents, rather than kids competing for affection. That should have never been up to us, though.\n\nAs a parent, it is definitely your job to help your kids achieve their best possible life. That means you need to get your oldest the help he needs to become able to carry his own weight, or if he really is incapable, look into housing situations that can support him. It also means you have to show up for your youngest! He may appear to have no needs, but I assure you that he does, and you're not meeting them. Spend time with him. Get to know him as a person, rather than a kid you raised. Listen to what his life and struggles are like, and offer appropriate help where you can an should.

I'm thankful for what they have given me, and I know my mom will leave me more than I expect, and I know she'll leave my brother more than that. And that's okay, because she's a mother, and she only wants to make sure her children are takin care of, and in this case my brother will need more to be taken care of, in the last thing I would do would make her feel bad about it.

He is an independent and successful adult now due to you.\n\n I assume Benji will be the one taking care of you in your last years (hopefully not soon). And it could be a long time he needs to take care of you. So it will be effectively his salary. And, frankly, Benji sounds like a child with special needs, and it is parents job to take care of these children even after they grow up. To make sure they will not end homeless, will not get into trouble, will have basic job skills and life skills.\n\nPlay it safe though: Your inheritance will not help if Benji is not able to live by himself. He cannot handle adult life now, you need to teach him.\n\nGet him into therapy for his anxiety and all the other issues.\n\nGet him into some PCA or nursing assistance program. It is not a university, so not so much pressure, and this knowledge will be very useful for both of you at the end of your life. This knowledge will also help him find a job if he needs so, these skills are in high demand. And maybe after that his anxiety will calm down and he could get more education? \n\nTalk to a lawyer how to make your will ironclad, so your other relatives will not be able to contest it. Because if they will - Benji will not be able to fight it.\n\nMake a trust, not just will him your money and assets. Use a lawyer as a trust manager. So Benji himself will not lose all the money making some dumb decisions.\n\nYou probably need to teach him (again) all the life skills: budgeting, cooking, social skills, appointment and time management, birth control/dating, how to interact with police and other authorities, etc...

You discussed a change to your will with Jack, and it wasn't in his favour, but you came to the table like grown-ass adult thinking there would be two of you sitting down to discuss this.\n\n3. Jack decided to act like an entitled infant because he's not getting your money like he thought he was going to. This is called \"being entitled\".\n\n4. Jack insulted Benji.  This is called \"punching down\" and \"being a jerk\"\n\n5. Jack cut you off, ignored your birthday, won't take your calls, and isn't spending Christmas with you. This is called \"being a raging asshole\"\n\n6. Jack told you it wasn't about the money or the assets.  In light of his reaction, this is called \"being a goddamn liar\".  \n\nSeems like from Jack's behaviour It's absolutely about the money and assets to him.   \n\nIt's your money and your assets and you can do what you want with them.  Jack has definitely shown you who he really is, and brother it ain't pretty.  The other folks in your family who are telling you your decision is wrong seem to have forgotten that it's your money and your assets so it's your decision.  \n\nMy condolences if Jack's behaviour came as a shock, it's never nice to be seen as a cash cow by one of your children or the rest of the family.  Some folks think that \"family\" is only about building generational wealth.  \n\nFrom all the other \"YTA\" comments I feel like I'm expressing a minority opinion: \n\n# NTA\n\nPS: Has Benji ever been assessed to see if he's ADHD or ASD?  Anxiety, being a square peg in a round-hole world, and strained relationships sound like there's other factors at play  (I am speaking as a late-diagnosed square peg myself but it never hurts to consider).\n\nPPS: I hope Jack figures himself out and doesn't drag more of the family into drama, although \"other members of the family have since become aware\" sounds more like \"Jack is engaging in toxic proxy warfare to try and force a change through emotional hostage-taking\" than \"I talked to other members of the family about this and they disagreed with me\".  \n\nPPPS: I hope you and Benji have a nice Christmas.

Tell Jack you will update the will and split the estate evenly if he stops working, cuts ties with his friends, and moves in with a parent. Tell him it's his choice. 100% he chooses his amazing career, friends, etc. over getting half your estate.  \n\n\nThe best thing would be if you live another 25 years, and Jack is nearly 60 when you pass away. He will likely be set up for retirement by then, have his house paid off, and won't care so much about the money. Over the next 25 years, you can even start disbursing some of your estate to Benjamin every year so he can benefit from your money before you pass away. Then there won't be as much to split up when you pass away. See a lawyer about trusts and estate gifts.\n\nOne last thing. Make Benji get a job and pay you some rent money. It will give him confidence and he will feel like he is contributing to the household.

Because I doubt OP\u2019s estate, even if the whole of it is given unfairly to Benji, will be enough to support both OP and Benji for the next 25-30 years plus Benji on his own for another 30 years after that.", ">you can't give one child more because the other became self-sufficient\n\nAnd most of the time the \"self-sufficient\" child became that way because the parent coddled their favorite child, while sacrificing their scapegoat child. \n\nI think of the Dunphys from Modern Family when it comes to these situations. Their oldest child is a mess, the youngest boy is questionable, but the middle child is exceeding beyond measures. However, the middle child gets her needs constantly sacrificed because the oldest got into trouble again, or the youngest goofed up again, and so she is constantly neglected because the other kids need more attention.\n\nGrowing up with the attention focused on the problem children is one thing, and some people can accept it and move on. But to then be ignored when it comes to inheritance is the final slap in the face that you don't matter to your parents because you \"did what needed to be done\"", "I think Benji will suddenly become self-sufficient once there isn't anyone coddling him anymore. He obviously never experienced tough love because mommy always was there to hold her hand over him. University is too hard, mommy will understand. Working is tiresome so he quits and mommy will hold his hand. Management 'bullied' him, mommy will believe him.\n\nI bet he is weaponizing his incompetence at this point. There is a reason he doesn't want to get tested for being on the spectrum.", "And what if something terrible happens in Jack\u2019s life that is out of his control and he really needs his half of the inheritance? If you live in America, he could be one bad medical bill away from losing a LOT. \n\nSplit it evenly or lose your very-obviously second favorite child forever.", "We have limited details but I wonder if Benji is somewhat on the spectrum or has some other type of neuro discrepancy. He sounds very reclusive and the comment of \u2018trying to fit a square peg in a world of holes\u2019, the brothers comments of Benji always being coddled- he has never had a partner as far as OP is aware, he doesn\u2019t have friends, it could\u2019ve been a case where OP was/is in denial that her child wasn\u2019t born to her or society\u2019s ideals as perfect but OP is still an asshole as if this is the case Beni has never been given the tools to succeed in life. I\u2019m sure after OP passes Benji will become a full on recluse and will not be able to support himself. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s picking favorites or one child needed more than the other, which Benji would\u2019ve been in school in the late 90s- early 00\u2019s. Autism awareness wasn\u2019t what it is today but it was still out there. There has to be an underlying reason why you believe Benji is incapable of having the things your other child has. Working on helping him with his anxiety and adjusting to the world would do him far better than leaving him the majority of your assets after you\u2019ve passed.", "I agree that she\u2019s YTA but I don\u2019t necessarily think things should be 100% equal. \n\nI am arguably the more successful sibling that was definitely the cheapest among us 3 kids. It\u2019s already incredibly unequal because I paid my way through college while my folks took out loans/borrowed money from me to help my siblings. Still, I graduated with little to no debt while they had huge amounts. Then I chose to elope and have a cheap backyard party while my sis had a large expensive one. My husband and I make more money while my parents still pay my brothers rent. I could go on\u2026\n\n\nWhen discussing wills, my dad said he\u2019s trying to split things kind of equally, while recognizing different kids have different needs. I told him I appreciated it, and would be happy with whatever I\u2019m left. He laughed and said \u201cit will never be equal, you\u2019d have to get the entire inheritance to be equal, which you know you don\u2019t need\u201d which is true, but in my whole heart of hearts I don\u2019t care. Equal would\u2019ve grown resentment of me from my siblings where instead I don\u2019t really care they\u2019ve gotten more. My struggles from 18-23 helped give me the tools my brother is now lacking. \n\nI think that\u2019s where OP is the biggest AH. It\u2019s not about the will, it\u2019s about the damage she is doing RIGHT NOW to the freeloading son. Unless he has mental issues where he will always need help (in which case he should apply for disability) then he should be focusing on the eventual independence he will be forced to have when OP dies. OP needs to force her son to be independent then split her will somewhat equally, knowing it will already never be fully equal. To give the already receiving huge benefits son the majority of the will is backwards.", "To add to this comment, a lot of redditors are saying that Jack is being penalized, but I actually think these situations can come from a type of emotional abuse where parents choose a kid to essentially emotionally cripple. It gives the parents an ongoing role to build their self esteem and keeps them busy at the cost of their child\u2019s normal independence into adulthood. Regardless of what happens, Jack may want to count himself lucky he wasn\u2019t the target of his parents preventing him from being independent.", "Codependent is what came to mind to me as well.  I wish my parents would push my brother from the nest now, when they are still alive to support his transition.  I know they are planning to divide assests unevenly - I don't care about that.

My brother has not worked in over 20 years and, although he doesn\u2019t live at home, my dad pays his rent and bills.\n\nMy brother has never pushed himself and become independent because he\u2019s never had to. My father has mollycoddled him all his life to the point he\u2019s incapable of living independently. On of my biggest worries is what happens after my father dies.\n\nIn our case, the inheritance will still be split equally, but because my parents did nothing to encourage my brother to learn to take care of himself, in fairly sure he\u2019ll blow through his share in a matter of months and then come to me with his hand out. \n\nNo matter how I\u2019ve tried to talk to my dad about letting him stand on his own two feet, it\u2019s like a brick wall. Why? Because my dad needs to be needed. He needs to be the big man who jumps in and fixes all the problems. And then he likes to use the fact that he saved the day to \u2018prove\u2019 that you can\u2019t do anything without him and you\u2019re useless. And uses it as leverage to micromanage your life.\n\nThis is why I haven\u2019t accepted any financial help from my father over the years, though god knows I could have used it at times. \n\nAnd so I\u2019m perceived as the \u2018capable\u2019 one who doesn\u2019t need help. And yes, it can make you bitter seeing your brother (and, to a lesser extent, my sister) having money handed to them hand over fist, while Im struggling through.\n\nIt\u2019s not about greed. Wills are often seen by adult children as a reflection of love, or how they\u2019re valued. And what you\u2019re telling your son is that all his hard work, everything he\u2019s done to make you proud, is worth nothing. That all the sacrifices he\u2019s made for his future were pointless and stupid.\n\nAnd that his brother, who\u2019s already benefited from having no rent and no bills his whole adult life, and sacrificed nothing, will be rewarded further. And that you will continue to refuse to make him stand on his own two feet so that, when you pass - probably in another 20 years or so - he\u2019ll be left with a 50-something man who wants someone else to take over looking after him - and will probably blow any inheritance, because you\u2019ve let him develop no life skills.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely TA to Jack, but you\u2019re also horribly abusive to Benjamin because you\u2019ve refused to be a proper parent to him and help him learn to be independent.

He got into debt because he simply couldn't manage his money and has zero life skills. He goes out for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Hires a handyman for every small issue etc.  \nHim going into debt because such small things, helped my mother to see the view of my late grandmother.   \n\n\nBut OP really needs a trustee for Benji.", "You know Benji was probably going to have Jack to lean on in the future (when you\u2019re gone), but you fucked that duck.

I think any professional will tell you that Benji needed the boot ten years ago.", "He failed Benji in life and when he is dead as well.", "YTA, but not necessarily about changing the will but rather about, as Jack rightly calls out, what sounds like a lifetime of favoritism and coddling.\n\nThese situations are always tough, I think most parents by instinct want to help their children according to need rather than equally, but this always causes resentment.", "I'm going to give OP the benefit of the doubt that Benji isn't the way he is because of OP's treatment of him, and that there are other issues that affect him.\n\nSo for me, I would almost ALWAYS advocate equal split of inheritance among children. It gets unnecessarily messy otherwise. BUT... there are considerations of equity that may alter this. For example... is Benji diagnosed or undiagnosed neuro-divergent (e.g., ASD)? Does he suffer from other untreated psychological ailments. The \"square peg in a round hole\" reference seems to point to this.\n\nI find all this talk by redditors about \"lazy this\" and \"lazy that\" to be the typical types of nonsense you see online. Maybe it's true. But my read on the situation is that Benji probably needed additional resources a long time ago to have a chance at a \"normal\" life with friends, spouses, a career, and that was when people let him down. Or maybe that was never in the cards. Now, as an adult approaching middle age, he may foreseeably need to continue relying on others when OP passes away.\n\nObviously, the best case scenario is that Jack and Benji have a good relationship, Jack agrees that Benji will need services going forward, agrees to an unequal split, and even agrees to be some sorta Trustee to a trust set up to take reasonable care of Benji.\n\nBut it sounds like Jack and Benji don't have that kind of relationship, unfortunately, so perhaps you'll need to make other arrangements and hire someone.", "Sounds more like Benji possibly has mental health concerns (possibly autism) and is unlikely to everfunction independently. A formal diagnosis may help Jack accept this.", "So what if Benji has a disability or mental illness that puts him at a disadvantage socializing and making ends meet?

Why would you feel the need to leave money to someone who's very well off, just to not hurt their feelings? Realistically, Jack doesn't need it at all to have a good life, but Benji depends on it to basically survive... Sometimes, being a good parent is being the asshole and giving your kids what they need instead of what they want.", "And lets face it, Benji will more than likely burn through the estate since he doesn't seem to have the tools to be able to handle any kind of wealth passed to him since he's never experience life as an adult.", "Wait: The only bad in this world happens to Benji.
