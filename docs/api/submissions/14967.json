Alissa has been talking about getting a gastric sleeve surgery for the past year or two to help her lose weight. For those who don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s a surgery where they essentially shrink the size of your stomach and you can lose up to 50% of excess body fat within a year or two of the surgery. I know it\u2019s been extremely difficult for her to lose weight and I\u2019m very happy that she wants to look into different methods help her gain control of her life again. She has finally found a doctor who she feels comfortable with and has gone in for a few consultations to learn more about the procedure and everything has seemed like it was going well regarding the surgery.\n\nBut recently, she came over for dinner with my wife and I. Alissa explained to us that the surgery she wants is expensive and the doctor quoted $22,000 USD for the surgery as well as some plastic surgery afterwards that she wants done to remove excess skin/scars. Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t have any savings and has been living close to paycheck to paycheck because she works in retail management and the cost of living in our city is extremely high.\n\nIn comparison, my wife and I work in decently stable fields and have 9-5 corporate jobs so we\u2019re in a better financial position than Alissa. So she asked us if we could pay for her gastric sleeve surgery and the plastic surgery afterwards too because she can\u2019t afford it and our parents also cannot help her financially. After speaking with my wife privately, we decided that we couldn\u2019t pay for it without changing our current lifestyles, but we would be willing to put $5,000 towards the procedures and we could take care of her pets during the recovery period.\n\nAlissa has been extremely cold to us since we told her this and is now bad mouthing my wife and I for not helping her have a \u201cnecessary life changing experience\u201d and prioritizing our current lifestyle over her health. I think she feels as if I\u2019m the one now holding her back from living her life to the fullest/healthiest. My parents have even called saying maybe we can pull our son (16M) out of his private school which costs a similar amount for a year and put that money towards Alissa\u2019s health. My wife immediately turned them down saying this will disrupt his education and mental health and we will not be doing this. Now we\u2019re the AHs of the family and everyone thinks we\u2019re greedy snobs. I want my sister to get healthier, but I think we\u2019ve already offered enough cash and our time if needed.

Bariatric surgery can be helpful, but if she doesn't address the underlying causes of her obesity she will just gain the weight back. Addressing the root causes, such as hormonal problems, emotional issues,  poor eating habits, or lack of exercise, would be much more cost effective and permanent ways to improve her health. The fact that she is now blaming you shows she has a victim mentality. Her problem is that she blames outside factors and doesn't acknowledge her role in creating her situation or her ability to fix it if she changes. Paying for the surgery wouldn't really help her.\n\nYou have been more than generous by offering the 5k. You have your own financial responsibilities to take care of. Your son should not be negatively affected because your sister is guilting you into paying for a treatment that may not even work for her. \n\nIf your sister feels that strongly about getting the surgery she should take out a loan or find an extra source of income to save up for it.

Honestly, I have empathy for your sister, given this *would* be a life changing thing for her, and it's so frustrating not to be able to afford something that could genuinely improve your quality of life. I have relatives who are way better off financially than I am, and if I'm honest, it's hard sometimes to not feel resentment that they can afford all these \"extras\" in life when we're barely managing to afford the basics. But. That's my problem. And it's hers. You offered to contribute, and that was generous. You're not obligated to disrupt your son's life/education to help her pay for something that's optional/cosmetic. I'm willing to bet there are other avenues available to her to raise the funds. She can't realistically expect you to be willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars just because she demands you do so.", "You offered 5000.00 which is a large sum of money and almost 25% of the total she would need. There are companies that offer medical loans for this very thing. To demand you take away from your son in order for to give to her is incredibly entitled.  And now her weight is all your fault right?\n\nNTA\n\nEdit:  I would also send a text message, not a phone call and not an email. \u201cI see by your social media posts and the calls from Mom and Dad, that our offer of 5000.00 to help with your medical costs, is not good enough. We therefore rescind the offer, no longer offer anything and consider this a closed subject.\u201d", "Wait. She didn't ask for a loan and or think to pay you back she just straight up asked for 22k initially plus more for all of her other procedures??? NTA\n\n\nEven when you and your wife offered 5k towards the procedure your sister had the nerve to act like you two weren't helping at all? Sorry but to all the people who think you and your wife are in the wrong. Why don't they fund your sister's procedure if they can't they shouldn't complain how you and your wife spend your own hard earned money. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis will sound rude i'm sure to some. But i think at that point if your sister is so serious about losing weight but can't afford the surgery. She should consider doing it the old fashioned way.

They will help any way they can too. )", "NTA. Your sister is acting extremely entitled for you to fix a problem caused completely by her. The audacity to bad mouth you is gross.

Your offer of $5k and helping with pets its MORE than fair, and she's spitting all over it.\n\nTell her to sell her pets and vehicle and to take out a loan before you are asked to downgrade your completely reasonable lifestyle.", "NTA!! It's not your responsibility to fix a problem she spent 21 years creating (I'm generously only counting the years she was a legal adult). The entitlement is astounding. Pull your kid out of his school?? \n\nAlso the plastic surgery isn't a necessity and that is something that will be several years out after she works toward losing the weight, so she can work to saving up for that part of it.", "NTA She has no right to expect you to pay for her procedure.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Before even meeting with a surgeon, the PCP I use sends you to a nutritionist who assess you as well and says whether or not they think you need bypass. And even then, you have to do so many therapy/education sessions. You can't just walk in and say \"Bypass!\" \n\nAnd even if you do get it, I think a lot of people think it's a magic wand and not an entire lifestyle change.

Lots of appointments with different medical personnel, and she had to get down to a certain weight.  She's now had the surgery, and although she's lost some weight, she is still obese.  I do see a big difference in her eating habits, though, so I'm really looking forward to seeing a slimmer, more confident friend in the future!", "The only time I think it's okay to expect someone to pay for IVF, is when adults are being pestered by their parents to give them grandchildren.", "Care to point me to this research because it definitely is 100% science that CICO is how bodies work. \n\nFind a peer-reviewed study that **is not** self-reported.

Our current premier also thinks GoFundMes are the way to go. Yay.....", "I had gastric bypass 5 years ago. Sister is NOT ready anyway. The biggest part of this decision is you HAVE to start taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions and stop blaming others for your problems. The surgery isn't a magical cure. It's just a tool. And like a hammer or a saw, if you don't use your tool correctly, you're just gonna hurt yourself. \n\nNYA, OP. Until sister is ready to take actual responsibility for her life instead of expecting others to fix her problems, she's not ready for this surgery anyway.

Truly incredible.", "What is with all these posts about people wanting their siblings to pay for something extravagant? Since when do siblings buy expensive stuff or give thousands of dollars to eachother? My sister would never ask me to pay for something like this and I wouldn't do it either, especially something considered a luxury. Does nobody borrow money anymore? Why is it always pay instead of lend money? Entitlement.", "Those habits are crucial to establish prior to the surgery - the problem usually after losing weight traditionally is that your hunger hormones go up (and stay up), and satiety hormones go down. The more you lose, the hungrier you eventually become, and regain doesn't completely fix this. The hormonal imbalance stays for a while (and it is powerful), contributing to people generally gaining more weight back than where they were originally. 95% of people who lose weight, rebound. There are some newer medications out there helping with appetite control. Personally I find them lacking while many have had great success. \n\nThe surgery obviously helps with initial appetite control aspect - you cannot eat enough. A surgeon I consulted with mentioned that the surgery also triggers a rewiring period in your brain which is not attained with non-surgical weight-loss alone. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31507395/\n\nWith success rate of 70% of people who have bariatric surgery keeping the weight off (of I recall correctly), the success rate compared to 5% of dieters succeeding long-term is pretty significant.", "One thing to note when talking about \"regain\" with bariatric surgery is the difference between that and \"failure.\" They tell everyone who gets it you will likely regain a small portion, but you shouldn't gain all of it back if you continue to follow the plan and MOST surgeries are successful at substantial weight loss. It isn't 100%, but it's WAY above the statistics for people who lose significant weight without surgery. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6320354/\n\nFrom my personal experience, the surgery has made my body work with me during the weight loss process instead of against me. Every time I'd lose weight before, after 20 or so lbs, I'd get awful cravings and feel bad and end up regaining even more than I'd lost. Now, my body actually has the ability to feel full. I sometimes forget to eat which is amazing because before I thought about food literally all the time.  Food ruled my life. I got therapy for a long time before that and it didn't have nearly the effect at changing my relationship with food that the surgery did because so much of hunger/craving is hormones.  The surgery doesn't just make your stomach smaller, it affects your hormone levels and absorbstion as well. I always thought I was \"just weak\" for eating so much but all of my body's chemical signals were telling me that's what I needed. Now my body's signals are more in line with someone at a healthy weight and I eat accordingly. \n\nThe OP definitely doesn't need to give her anything because that's not his job, but this surgery can be life changing and life saving and the misinformation around it in the world actively prevents people from accessing this care. The concept that people have a moral obligation to lose weight the old fashioned way when there are effective medical interventions available is rooted in anti-fat bias that wants to punish fat people for being that way. It ties fatness to a morality that wants them to earn the right to get skinny.  Surgery is 100% not for everyone, but for some people it is life changing.", "Agreed, any financial gestures of good will get revoked upon badmouthing the giver.\n\nOP NTA.", "This. \n\nIt takes a few steps to be approved for surgery.  One is sticking to a diet before the surgery as well as a clear from a therapist.", "\"I know it\u2019s been extremely difficult for her to lose weight\" Definitely not our place to say that for sure when OP says this. She may well have very good reasons that she's struggled.\n\nThat being said, they don't owe her the money and are NTA regardless, but being fat isn't a moral failing and needing weight loss help is also not a moral failing.\n\n It's hard as fuck. Eating healthy can be pretty expensive - not just money-wise (but it can be!) but also with time, energy and effort put into cooking. She's living paycheck to paycheck, she just might not be able to, might have something that's preventing her from losing weight, might just struggle with her portion sizes and her body will pretty quickly let her know she can't eat as much as she did before if she gets it.\n\nSorry this kind of got unloaded on you, but I'm tired of reddit making out that it's super easy to lose weight. I've been trying for years and the only time I managed was when I was too scared to eat for three months and because I went from overweight to a \"healthy\" weight, doctors never treated the reason, never listened to why I had lost so much weight/showed concern about losing 60+kg in 3-4 months and just congratulated me on the weight loss.", "100% this! It's not a magic bullet. You can't plunk your money down and go to the checkout. If the sister does not have the discipline to at least contribute to our surgery, just for my experience working with bariatric patients and by no means the 100% correct barometer, she may not have committed to it in the way that is necessary.\n\nIt is really really important for the patient who is receiving a surgery to do something to show their commitment to it. If anything, if you have the money? I would absolutely pay for the consultation. I have a strong suspicion that based on the idea that she thinks someone else is going to give it to her, she may not end up being a great candidate. Then there's no question about more money being needed until she addresses more psychological issues", "It's absolutely not super easy. And a 22k surgery may help jump start you on the right path, but it's not a magic cure. If you don't have willpower and develop proper eating habits after having it done, you're going to go right back to the behavior that leads to weight gain again. Then you'll have wasted 22k for nothing.\n\nBut if you can develop those habits and willpower, then you may not need the 22k surgery.", "Successful patients make the lifestyle changes 6 months in advance and stick to them.  If she can't do that chance of sucess is poor.", "Definitely. I started at 350lbs and got down to 200lbs. I have maintained those eating habits and that weight. I had an x-ray of my sleeve, and it has not been stretched. People are very surprised that I am still obese despite not eating very much. I do count calories and always eat at a deficit. I hope revising my sleeve to a bypass will help me lose the last 50-60lbs. My surgeon is very confident.", "Yeah, I know people who've not done that and also people who've done that, so it varies, I just don't think it's super fair to say she could lose the weight without doing it when it sounds like they've explored avenues with that already from OP's wording. It doesn't super matter either way because it's not really the question being asked but I'm just a little tired of the 'if you can't lose weight you're the problem, nobody ever has other factors that stop them from losing weight' thing that came up in the wake of making fun of people who say they're genetically disposed to be heavy."]}
