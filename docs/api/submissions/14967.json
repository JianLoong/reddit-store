Alissa has been talking about getting a gastric sleeve surgery for the past year or two to help her lose weight. For those who don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s a surgery where they essentially shrink the size of your stomach and you can lose up to 50% of excess body fat within a year or two of the surgery. I know it\u2019s been extremely difficult for her to lose weight and I\u2019m very happy that she wants to look into different methods help her gain control of her life again. She has finally found a doctor who she feels comfortable with and has gone in for a few consultations to learn more about the procedure and everything has seemed like it was going well regarding the surgery.\n\nBut recently, she came over for dinner with my wife and I. Alissa explained to us that the surgery she wants is expensive and the doctor quoted $22,000 USD for the surgery as well as some plastic surgery afterwards that she wants done to remove excess skin/scars. Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t have any savings and has been living close to paycheck to paycheck because she works in retail management and the cost of living in our city is extremely high.\n\nIn comparison, my wife and I work in decently stable fields and have 9-5 corporate jobs so we\u2019re in a better financial position than Alissa. So she asked us if we could pay for her gastric sleeve surgery and the plastic surgery afterwards too because she can\u2019t afford it and our parents also cannot help her financially. After speaking with my wife privately, we decided that we couldn\u2019t pay for it without changing our current lifestyles, but we would be willing to put $5,000 towards the procedures and we could take care of her pets during the recovery period.\n\nAlissa has been extremely cold to us since we told her this and is now bad mouthing my wife and I for not helping her have a \u201cnecessary life changing experience\u201d and prioritizing our current lifestyle over her health. I think she feels as if I\u2019m the one now holding her back from living her life to the fullest/healthiest. My parents have even called saying maybe we can pull our son (16M) out of his private school which costs a similar amount for a year and put that money towards Alissa\u2019s health. My wife immediately turned them down saying this will disrupt his education and mental health and we will not be doing this. Now we\u2019re the AHs of the family and everyone thinks we\u2019re greedy snobs. I want my sister to get healthier, but I think we\u2019ve already offered enough cash and our time if needed.

Bariatric surgery can be helpful, but if she doesn't address the underlying causes of her obesity she will just gain the weight back. Addressing the root causes, such as hormonal problems, emotional issues,  poor eating habits, or lack of exercise, would be much more cost effective and permanent ways to improve her health. The fact that she is now blaming you shows she has a victim mentality. Her problem is that she blames outside factors and doesn't acknowledge her role in creating her situation or her ability to fix it if she changes. Paying for the surgery wouldn't really help her.\n\nYou have been more than generous by offering the 5k. You have your own financial responsibilities to take care of. Your son should not be negatively affected because your sister is guilting you into paying for a treatment that may not even work for her. \n\nIf your sister feels that strongly about getting the surgery she should take out a loan or find an extra source of income to save up for it.

Honestly, I have empathy for your sister, given this *would* be a life changing thing for her, and it's so frustrating not to be able to afford something that could genuinely improve your quality of life. I have relatives who are way better off financially than I am, and if I'm honest, it's hard sometimes to not feel resentment that they can afford all these \"extras\" in life when we're barely managing to afford the basics. But. That's my problem. And it's hers. You offered to contribute, and that was generous. You're not obligated to disrupt your son's life/education to help her pay for something that's optional/cosmetic. I'm willing to bet there are other avenues available to her to raise the funds. She can't realistically expect you to be willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars just because she demands you do so.", "You offered 5000.00 which is a large sum of money and almost 25% of the total she would need. There are companies that offer medical loans for this very thing. To demand you take away from your son in order for to give to her is incredibly entitled.  And now her weight is all your fault right?\n\nNTA\n\nEdit:  I would also send a text message, not a phone call and not an email. \u201cI see by your social media posts and the calls from Mom and Dad, that our offer of 5000.00 to help with your medical costs, is not good enough. We therefore rescind the offer, no longer offer anything and consider this a closed subject.\u201d", "Wait. She didn't ask for a loan and or think to pay you back she just straight up asked for 22k initially plus more for all of her other procedures??? NTA\n\n\nEven when you and your wife offered 5k towards the procedure your sister had the nerve to act like you two weren't helping at all? Sorry but to all the people who think you and your wife are in the wrong. Why don't they fund your sister's procedure if they can't they shouldn't complain how you and your wife spend your own hard earned money. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis will sound rude i'm sure to some. But i think at that point if your sister is so serious about losing weight but can't afford the surgery. She should consider doing it the old fashioned way.

They will help any way they can too. )", "NTA. Your sister is acting extremely entitled for you to fix a problem caused completely by her. The audacity to bad mouth you is gross. And over your child's education?! Hell no!", "NTA.\n\nYes it would be ideal that you could do such an amazing favor for her, but it comes at too big a cost. Your offer of $5k and helping with pets its MORE than fair, and she's spitting all over it.\n\nTell her to sell her pets and vehicle and to take out a loan before you are asked to downgrade your completely reasonable lifestyle.", "NTA!! It's not your responsibility to fix a problem she spent 21 years creating (I'm generously only counting the years she was a legal adult). The entitlement is astounding. Pull your kid out of his school?? \n\nAlso the plastic surgery isn't a necessity and that is something that will be several years out after she works toward losing the weight, so she can work to saving up for that part of it.", "NTA She has no right to expect you to pay for her procedure.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
