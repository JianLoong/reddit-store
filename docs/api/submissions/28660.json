We're from Portugal btw\n\nOne day we decided to go to a slightly fancier restaurant, with a (I guess) prized chef.\n\nBefore booking the restaurant we saw the menu and everything was way too complex and not like the food we usually eat, but at the bottom it had a note saying \"If you want a more traditional dish that's not on the menu, ask our waiter and if the chef has the ingredients, we'll make it\". Great!\n\nWe got there, were sitted by a very polite waiter (Waiter 1) and then showed the menu by a different waiter (Waiter 2).\n\nWe saw the menu, but asked if it would be possible to get a simple Carbonara and a Bolognese. The waiter was kind of shaken, and pointed us to an expensive plate saying it was kind of like a Bolognese (I get it, it's his job to sell what they have) but we said we still wanted what we asked for. It made him visibly awkward and he asked why we came to that restaurant for just a Bolognese and Carbonara...\n\nI was very upset that a waiter asked me why I wanted a specific, and apparently lesser dish and told him the menu said they made traditional dishes, so go ask the chef if he can make it. \n\nWaiter 2 left, and we were left feeling very embarrassed and awkward. We asked Waiter 1 if it was normal to be asked why we wanted a specific dish and he seemed as surprised as us that the question was asked.\n\nCouple of minutes later I see the chef come out of the kitchen and come towards us. I think \"Well maybe he's come to apologize, how nice\".\n\nHe arrives, introduces himself, welcomes us to his restaurant..... and asks... \"Why did you come to (restaurant name) for just a Bolognese and a Carbonara?\"\n\nI lost my cool, got up, started saying this was ridiculous, was I on a prank show? I've never been asked this by a chef coming directly from the kitchen to talk down to me about what food I chose to eat!\n\nHe said that restaurant had won a lot of awards, asked me if I knew how a good Carbonara was made, that it wasn't like the rest of the restaurants made... I said YES, SO MAKE ME THE BEST CARBONARA IVE HAD!\n\nHe took us outside, maybe I was kind of making a scene (I was never disrespectful, just talked loudly) grabbing on the way a framed award he had hanged on the wall. Outside he showed us the award, said that that restaurant was very well renowned, said I was very young, and offered to take us inside and buy us the best meal we ever had, free of charge. By then we were too upset and embarrassed to eat there so we just left.\n\nMost of the people I've told his story sided with me, but some have implied that I was in the wrong.... AITA?\n\nEdit: Both Bolognese and Carbonara are Italian dishes and not American as some comments seem to think\n\nEdit 2: Found a photo of the menu.

That can takes hours of simmering to do right and they probably figured you weren\u2019t familiar with Italian food or possibly messing with them because of it.

That note is probably there to challenge the chef, not to make basic recipes. My local Italian restaurant in Texas offers both of those items.", "NTA, but why did you go to a restaurant with nothing you wanted on the menu?", "YTA. Do you know what it takes to run a busy restaurant? They likely dont have the time and prepped materials laid out and portioned for the dishes you requested.

Why the hell would you go to a restaurant knowing you won't order anything off their menu???? And would it have killed you to try the alternative they suggested that was on the menu?", "YTA just for going to a place *knowing* you don't like literally *anything* on the actual menu. Like, the whole \"we'll make it if we can\" thing doesn't even matter; it was probably put there so people know they can customize menu items without too much trouble. \n\nYou chose a restaurant that had a set menu without anything you'd like, expecting a *fully* custom meal of items that aren't on the menu at all. It's just so fucking entitled.", "YTA. Regardless of the note, you booked this restaurant knowing what's on the menu. The note was there likely to satisfy children who want easy butter and pasta. If  the food was too \"complex\" for you, go somewhere else. That is extremely offensive to the chef. If you wanted carbonara or bolognese you could have made it yourself at home, instead of wasting this chef's time and the waiters time. It's embarrassing to you and the restaurant.", "INFO: Don't they have Olive Garden in Portugal?", "YTA. You went into a fine dining restaurant and asked the chef to make you peasant food.

Not that the chef is in the clear, but you're more TA than the chef.  \n\n\nWhat you did is like going to a couturier and asking them to fix a button on your shirt. A lot of traditional cuisines are like \"poor people's food\". There's a level above that where the flavors have been selected more carefully and then above that with more expensive ingredients and chefs who experiment to invent new flavors and combinations. Asking somene mid or high tier like that to prepare what's basically substandard basic food... yeah no, that's offensive. They put time and effort in composing their menu and you disregarded that in one fell swoop.  \n\n\nI suspect that the phrase at the bottom of the menu is for -pressing- issues. Like serious dislikes or food sensitivities. Not an \u00e1 la carte where they can cook everything that's not on the menu. That's private chef territory and probably even beyond that.", "YTA you went there knowing you didn\u2019t like the menu and asked for two dishes not on it. \n\nI get what the menu said, but you were told no.

I very much doubt that a \u201cfancy\u201d restaurant would have a \u201cnote\u201d in the menu saying they\u2019ll make you a dish they way you want it. Lastly, you had a tantrum, embarrassing yourself and your date when you were told no. Check your attitude, I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve had a bad experience in public and I\u2019m sure it was your attitude at fault. You were TA.", "YTA. You went to a gourmet restaurant to order two of the simplest dishes in existence, and you're *shocked* that you were met with surprise? \n\nObviously you should not eat out, ever. Regardless of what the menu says about making something special for you. *order from the damn menu.* You say you saw it in advance and decided that, even though you wanted nothing on the menu, you were both going to go AND not call ahead to see if it was a realistic request.", "YTA - Carbonara was invented by an American in Italy in the 40s, so not traditionally Italian, and certainly not fine dining Italian the way the restaurant probably thought of it. Bolognese sauce needs to simmer for hours.\n\nDid the restaurant even have other pasta dishes on the menu? What you did seems to me akin to walking into a high end sushi restaurant and asking them to make you a spam musubi or something. (Yes I realize that musubi is Hawaiian, that's kinda the point.)", "YTA. You changed the meaning of the note on the bottom of the menu to how you interpreted. The note translated in your edit is a completely different story. It reads that \u201cif you want something that\u2019s not on the menu, eat elsewhere.\u201d  It does not sound like they\u2019re saying they\u2019ll make you a dish that\u2019s not on their menu because you want it", "Imagine going to a restaurant and throwing a hissy fit when they don\u2019t have a bolognaise or carbonara.

Although I can\u2019t imagine why I would ever do that. \n\nI think the note at the bottom was more about accommodating vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free diners, and kids.", "YTA. You insulted the chef by not selecting something on the menu. You knew going in you didn\u2019t want any of it, SO WHY GO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? Oh, I\u2019m not yelling or causing a scene or being disrespectful or whatever.", "YTA for not ordering from the menu.  That\u2019s an absolute AH move anywhere.  Although I agree, they shouldn\u2019t encourage it with the note on the menu.  Still, just don\u2019t go there.  Bolognese takes hours to make, that isn\u2019t something they can just whip up.  Carbonara is just basic.  A step or two above buttered noodles. The whole point of going to an upscale restaurant with a noted chef is to expand your culinary horizons, not stay in your comfort zone and order something you already know.  Trust the chef that they are going to prepare something amazing.  He took your request as insulting because it basically questions his tastes and talents.", "YTA", ">I was very upset that a waiter asked me why I wanted a specific, and apparently lesser dish \n\nYTA.", "NTA if they didn't have it on the bottom of the menu, I would've reacted differently, but they say if you want them more traditional dish will try to make it. No need to insult the OP in his girlfriend all they had to say was sorry we don't have all those ingredients today. But I do wonder what the OP would have done if they said that \u2014 was there anything on the menu you would've been willing to eat? Overall I think the chef thinks too much of himself.", "If they don't want to cook \"a more traditional dish\" then they should'nt write in the menu that they would do it. NTA", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you just go to a restaurant with what you wanted on the menu?", "YTA. And a Moron!  Glad the Chef didn't have to waste time making your meals.

You know nothing, noodle slow.", "Of course YTA. Go to a simple Italian restaurant for that. My God you even looked at the menu and decided \"let's inconvenience everyone and make them do a personal dish just for us\" like the entitled brats you are. YTA.", "YTA.  It\u2019s one thing if one member of a party, particularly a large party, wants something different.  That\u2019s a normal thing and they are saying it is something they can accommodate.  It\u2019s quite another of an entire party is ordering something off the menu, particularly at a more upscale restaurant", "YTA  If there is nothing on the menu you like you went to the wrong restaurant. And if you you only want to eat what you usually eat then go eat it where you usually eat it. Ordering off the menu on your own requirements is ALWAYS a Ahole move.  Where the correct pasta's types even on the menu or where you planning to wait a hour just for him to prep the pasta? Italian food is more then Pasta and Pizza. If you don't know how long a dish takes to make from scratch you are in no place to request it not on the menu.  \"Make a request\"  does not mean try to ask for kids menu dishes.\n\nClearly you just acted over entitled and ignorant, refusing to consider anything the restaurant was actually there for and instead threw a tantrum.

I'd make sure to put that on the review for them - rude waiter, rude chef, restaurant unable to follow through with their own promises.  I also bet the chef was unable to actually make what you requested and was too embarrassed to admit it.", "NTA. It might have been an unusual request, but then again, they offered to make a traditional dish if you wanted one. You wanted one. Then they made a big deal about NOT making the dish. They need to reprint the menu and leave that bit off, because they clearly don\u2019t mean it.", "Nta. I\u2019m a server and can\u2019t imagine this kind of rudeness flying in any of the many nice restaurants Ive work at. Is this common where any of yall live?", "YTA", "YTA\n\nWhy make restaurant workers jobs harder?", "NTA. All the discussion about whether you tried to order a traditional Italian dish is really irrelevant.  The waiter should have simply apologized and explained that the chef can't make it quickly enough.  All the incredulity and award showing was meant to embarrass you, and it wasn't necessary.", "These Y T A votes are crazy. If you can\u2019t/won\u2019t make a certain Italian dish, *don\u2019t say you will on the menu*. A bolognese is fair, that takes hours. A carbonara is not difficult or time consuming to prepare. NTA.", "Bolognese isn't a quick meal. The only reason you get it fast at the restaurant is because they cook a big batch of it in advance and just mix it with Spaggetti and serve it to you. So no, you can't get it if they don't have it on the menu. And yes,   if someone asked for carbonara at an upscale restaurant, they probably don't know food that well, and they've been eating mock carbonara made with cream. I'm not making them the real deal and having them fuck up my reputation because they never tasted a real deal. \n BTW, that chef was probably an owner who created the menue, so not weird at all for him to come to the table to speak to you.\n\nOn the other hand, they should have just told you that they don't have ingredients to make it. It's not their job to \"educate\" you.\n\nESH", "NTA. If they didn\u2019t want to make it, they should have just said no.", "YTA and so is every other person that can't eat off a menu without a bunch of childish request.", "NTA. I don't understand why they made it a big deal if the option was on the menu.", "What's with the chef literally being unable to say \"sorry, I can't right today\"? NTA\n\nAlso, aren't the comments from Americans fun.", "NTA-You didn't have to \"make a scene\" but the Waiter and owner being AHs provoked you.\nThey offered simpler dishes and then tried to insult and embarrass you for taking the option you were given.", "So you went to an Italian fancy spot and there was no carbonara or bolognese? Really?", "YTA.  If you are going to order pretend- Americanized Italian food, go home and eat Chef Boyardee. And quit going to nice restaurants. Olive Garden might be more your speed.  Making those dishes instantly is not a realistic expectation.", "YTA - Carbonara is considered to be an American dish, not Italian. The same is said of Bolognese. Neither is a traditional Italian dish, and you basically insulted the chef by ordering these items.\n\n(there is absolutely nothing wrong with liking either of these dishes, btw.

Mostly because of the stupid note they included on the menu.

I\u2019m not. Although I have eaten there many times I don\u2019t feel that I am recognized as a regular. If the first waiter had said sorry but no, I wouldn\u2019t have fussed, just ordered something else. \n\nI was fortunate that the first waiter came back and I was able to leave a nice tip, because I would have left a very minimal amount for the second. \n\nA lot of times people go out to eat for a real treat. Why spoil the experience?", "YTA. What were you thinking? Paying less for a cheaper meal so you could tell everyone you ate at that specialty restaurant?", ">I think \"Well maybe he's come to apologize, how nice\".\n\nHow dense are you?? Even besides the practical issue with your \"order\", you totally snubbed the chef. He came out to give you a chance to recover the situation and you did it again *to his face*. You need to learn some manners or just maybe don't go to a restaurant anymore. YTA obviously.", "YTA. Stay home if you can\u2019t handle anything more complex than noodles and tomato sauce.", "No judgment. It would have been a fun culinary experience to try something different. It would have for me anyway. \n\nNote: I am American and learned to make carbonara from an Italian colleague. My Italian-American aunt (actually Mom\u2019s best friend for my entire life) says it\u2019s the second best she\u2019s tried after the one she had a really nice restaurant in Rome. I can live with that.", "ESH. The waiters could've said no. The chef could've said no. Y'all could've tried something new. Everyone was stupid in how they handled things.", "I cannot imagine looking up a menu ahead of time, not seeing anything I want and then PURPOSEFULLY GOING ANYWAY.", "ESH:\n\nI think a lot of commenters here are going very hard and missing the chef coming out specifically and kind of talking in a terribly embarrassing and condescending manner when the menu apparently says they can do what OP is requesting. Maybe he should have pointed exactly to where it says that a bit more but no the chef shouldn\u2019t have walked out like that. Tell the waiter you can\u2019t do it or have the manager come out and talk in a quiet and polite manner (not condescending).", "YTA YTA YTA +! Why would you go to a restaurant and expect BOTH MEALS to be something not on the menu? and make a scene. Go to a restaurant that has the meals you want on the menu.", "I made mine in 3.5 hours last night", "This, my ragu takes 5 hrs at least. What an asshole.", "I don't know. If they weren't prepared to do it, they should have just said so and we would have acted accordingly", "I wanted to have a very very good Carbonara. Because I know a high end Carbonara is very different from a cheaper one", "Probably should have done that. But I was shocked. That had never happened and it felt like a ridiculous circumstance", "Ok, that's a good point. Don't you think they could have explained it like that instead of the way they did?", "Not whatever, that WOULD be wild! Just traditional Italian dishes. It's in Portuguese but I can DM you if you want xD", "Found a photo of the menu. Here's what it literally says (translated from Portuguese):\n\n\"If you want a dish from traditional Italian cuisine, that is not on the list, please request it near our collaborators. If we have the ingredients we can cook it exclusively for you\"", "And you think a carbonara and a bolognese in Texas of all places is even going to be anywhere remotely similar to a carbonara and bolognese in Europe?!", "Why not? The service offered at a fancy restaurant entails far more than the main dish. If they offer to prepare more traditional food, customers asking for that should be expected. But I guess all parties could have handled that situation better.\nOP should not have made a scene and the chef could have taken it as a challenge, as in respecting their customers wishes while also doing it in a fancy way.", "Good question. Specifically because of the note about the traditional dishes and because I know a high end Carbonara is very very different in ingredients and preparation than a cheaper restaurant", "But then why write that on the menu? Why have the chef waste his precious time explaining that to them? If he doesnt have the time then why didnt he just tell the waiter to say no?", "If they don\u2019t have the time then they shouldn\u2019t put that note on the menu & they also should have explained that rather than acting like lunatics. \n\nI\u2019m waffling between NTA and ESH because I think it was handled poorly on both sides, but I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d put that note on the menu to then act like this.", "As the menu stated, if they didn't have the ingredients prepped they just had to say that, and we would act accordingly", "Can't post pictures on this sub, I think. It's in Portuguese but I can DM you", "But that's a whole other meaning? 'We can cater for picky eaters' is not the same as 'if you want a traditional dish off the menu, you can ask and we might be able to cook it for you'. OP only asked because that's what the menu said, how is that offensive to the chef?", "Nope", "With the way OP is describing the waiters and chef's reaction (and his own behaviour later on) I suspect his attitude had a lot to do with their response.", "Ok this is interesting. I was wondering about the translation because it seemed odd and then what does collaborator even mean in a restaurant context??", "If they said they couldn't make what we asked, we would have apologized and left. Everything else was very complex and not to our liking. Probably would have been awkward, but we gave it a shot", "Not at all. Never happened to me or anyone I know", "They sure are!", "I'm from Portugal and neither dish I asked for is American... they are both traditional Italian dishes", "You are very fucking wrong. r/confidentlyincorrect \n\nYou getting posted", "Carbonara is absolutely not considered an American dish it's a traditional dish that you would very easily in Italy.", "LOL you the ignorant. Bolognese sauce is traditional from Bologna. As for carbonara, I can\u2019t remember where it comes from, but it\u2019s somewhere in Italy for sure. Edit: Rome. It\u2019s from Rome.\n\nTrue carbonara is made with guanciale (Italian specialty, a part of the pork), egg yolk, black pepper and pecorino cheese. Edited: a previous version of this comment said carbonara has parmigiano cheese. That\u2019s wrong. \n\nTrue bolognese takes hours to cook. It\u2019s made of tomato, mortadella and other veggies, and it\u2019s left slow cooking for two-three hours. \n\nNow. I wouldn\u2019t have asked them to cook anything traditional because of those dishes are not included in the menu, it\u2019s because clearly they don\u2019t want to cook them. They\u2019re modern, and that\u2019s fine\u2026 so don\u2019t say on your effing menu of your fancy restaurant that you\u2019ll cook traditional dishes if requested. Please. \n\nNTA. Just stick to your regular Italian from now on. And if you come to Valencia, Spain, there\u2019s a couple of places that you may love. DM me.", "Just FYI, both those dishes are definitely Italian in origin.  Maybe you are thinking of Alfredo?\n\nESH.  Restaurant shouldn\u2019t have it on the menu and OP overreacted.", "Bolognese is originally from Bologna, Carbonara is from Rome or Napoli. Neither is an American dish", "AMERICAN?? IJBOL", "You\u2019re thinking about Alfredo. Go to Rome and say that carbonara is an American dish and they will send you right back to Jersey.", "What the hell did you just say?", "Doesn\u2019t bolognese come from Bologna?", "There are lots of American (and British) versions of both those dishes, but there are also traditional regional Italian versions of both bolognese and carbonara. \n\nThey are very simple, regional dishes, not high-end. Mama's cooking.\n\nI can kinda see why an Italian chef in a restaurant in Portugal might not want to make them, because they're not there to make mama's cooking, they're gourmets! But if the menu said \"ask the chef if he can do it,\" then you can ask the chef if he can do it.", "Sbagliato.", "Love this dudes absolute brutally confident incorrectness.", "This is the stupidest comment i have ever read on reddit.", "You are as wrong as you could possibly be.", "From that note, it sounds to me that the restaurant is telling customers that if they don\u2019t want what\u2019s on the menu, to go elsewhere. Especially the part where it says \u201cplease request it near our collaborators\u201d", "Because the \u201cplease request it near our collaborators\u201d sounds like they\u2019re telling the customer to go elsewhere if they don\u2019t like what\u2019s on the menu", "I think OP misinterpreted the note on the bottom of the menu. It reads to me that they\u2019re telling customers who don\u2019t want what\u2019s on the menu to go elsewhere", "Hay! Got you beat. Made my Beefaronnie in under 3 min in the microwave last night. LOL Sorry, my cooking skills don't go above making a hamburger or chicken stew.", "A bolognese takes literally hours to make you jabroni. For someone that supposedly loves Italian food you should probably know that.", "Oh? What\u2019s your back up? Buttered noodles?", "The waiter did in a sense, they tried to redirect you to dishes on the menu. Learn how to take a hint.", "Mine only takes 2 and 1/2 hours. I am not traditional", "Why didn\u2019t you look up a place with good carbonara then? YTA for expecting - regardless of the note - to order exclusively off menu. Hire your own personal chef for the night if you want to dictate what is made. Clearly this restaurant wasn\u2019t serving what you wanted. Expecting a chef to take 20 minutes, minimum to dedicate solely to making you a dish they don\u2019t have prepared is really selfish. Never mind the time it takes to actually simmer a good Bolognese.", "I see, that makes sense! But you're still TA, because you wouldn't let it go. After asking the first time and getting a no, you should have ordered something else, or left.\n\nThe chef had to TAKE YOU OUTSIDE to reason with you.", "Then why not go to a high-end place that has carbonara on the menu? Or hire a personal chef?", "okay let's skip all the ridiculousness of the gavt that you even chose a restaurant that not only didn't have one but rather BOTH entrees you wanted in the menu...let's just skip that and focus on the fact that you found a scenario offputting/ridiculous/rude and proceeded to YELL in a restaurant and also that you were making DEMANDS while YELLING\n\nyou can say that you weren't disrespectful but I just do not believe that yelling in a fancy, expensive restaurant is acceptable whatsoever.  Feel free to say you're disappointed in their service and just leave if you have a problem.", "It had never happened because it\u2019s insanely rude to do what you did.\n\nMy bet is they have that on there in case there\u2019s a kid or someone in a group who can\u2019t eat what\u2019s on the menu. To deliberately go to a restaurant that has nothing you like on it, even if they can prepare something else, is a weird choice on your part.", "That chef was incredibly gracious to offer you a free meal after your rude behavior. You should have taken him up on it and learned more about what fine dining is.", "Shocked that a gourmet restaurant has standards?  Me too. Shocked you didn\u2019t consider this.", "If I look up a restaurant and they don\u2019t have a single item on the menu I want, I would simply not eat at that restaurant. YTA, OP. You should feel embarrassed.", "This isn't some mcdonalds that you are going to man.", "I know how you feel. I just went to McDonald's and asked for a 7-ELEVEN slurpee. The fucking nerve of them to have me thrown out.", "Go google how long it takes to make a good bolognese. You were an ass", "u/peteration\n\n\nYou sound like someone who thinks Olive Garden is the highest form of Italian fine dining.", "\u2026I think him offering you the best meal of your life for FREE was more than gracious enough of a response considering your outburst. YTA.", "Well presumably they thought that someone wanting a good one might have some clue as to the time involved in making one.", "Can you link to the photo you found?", "Hmm okay then, I wonder if maybe they were thinking this is a request to be made beforehand rather than at the restaurant, but to be fair they don\u2019t make that clear. This wording very much though makes it clear that this an option that they can say yes to at their discretion. So say no if they just don\u2019t feel like it. \n\nI would assume this is maybe for people who want difficult to find dishes and so the chef would offer to make it out of interest to grow their knowledge. By traditional they maybe are trying to emphasize exclusively made in Italy, less well known, etc since they didn\u2019t just say \u201cItalian cuisine\u201d. \n\nI do think the waiter, after having offered you a that dish (which I find no fault in him doing) could have just said \u201cno, sorry that menu option is not for carbonara or bolognese\u201d rather than questioning you on *why* you wanted those dishes. But I do think overall you had an unnecessarily heated reaction. You got upset and embarrassed quicker than I think was warranted and should have just taken the first waiter\u2019s attempted dismissal.", "Can you DM me the menu picture?", "I\u2019m sorry but that sounds like the menu is saying to go to other restaurants for the dishes you want not listed.", "dog, you can learn to cook from italians, it's not a secret magick that only works on european soil - that said, no one makes carbonara according to italian recipes outside of italy, i dunno why some of those dishes are called that. bolognese though, it's not hard to emulate.", "Not at all. No Italian food I can get in Texas could ever compare to what I can get in Italy! I don't care if it was something as simple as butter noodles. But I think it's become so ubiquitous that a \"fancy \" Italian restaurant doesn't want to serve it", "In some parts of Texas? Yes, you could absolutely expect that.

Kinda strange for everybody in their party to order off menu.", "I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because they did have those items  on the menu but they were more elaborately prepared than OP wanted, the chef note indicated they would have made something not on the menu and was insulted they wanted him to downgrade his recipes. Just a guess.", "Clearly they did try to tell him no without being blunt enough to outright say \"his face that \"no body had time for his nonsense\" to his face. He's the one that lost his sh\\*t and acted like a ahole.\n\nIts insane to go to a restaurant where you like none of the food and just demand your own dishes that clearly have nothing to do with what the menu offers. The staf reaction was entirely reasonable. Frankly they would have been justified in telling you to leave outright, instead they offered you a free meal. \n\nClearly the option to \"make a request\"  as a exception if a group member has specific dietary needs and the requested food is in line with the restaurants business.

Portuguese in general (and yes I can generalize bc I am Portuguese and husband Brazilian) take offense very easily so I can absolutely see how even tho there is that note, it is still rude.", "That's too bad, because you'd love it and they have all the breadsticks you can eat.", "I\u2019m guessing it just means peers in the local restaurant industry?", "why would you go to a restaurant with the intention of only ordering off-menu?", "You shouldn\u2019t have gone to that restaurant then.
