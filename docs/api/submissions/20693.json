{"id": 20693, "submission_id": "14k09hy", "title": "AITA for telling my husband it's his fault he's tired?", "selftext": "I'm in my third trimester of pregnancy, first kid. My husband wanted to travel to visit his friends and family, knowing that once baby comes, he probably won't be able to see them for awhile. He is taking some summer courses to get an advanced degree, but had a weeklong break between classes.  I said okay, knowing I wouldn't be able to go with because of how busy I am at work (if my doctor would even sign off on me traveling).\n\nHe had a great time there, but had a miserable time traveling home for reasons outside of his control. He got home early yesterday (when he was supposed to be back late the night before) and was exhausted. He slept most of the day, got up, did some homework and played video games for a few hours, and then went back to bed.\n\nWhich brings us to today. He had class from 9-3. We had a meeting with a birth coach at 6, and the meeting lasted about two hours. Immediately after the meeting, he turned to me and said \"great, now I'm not going to have time to do anything tonight.\" \n\nThis isn't the first time he's said something like this after something birth/pregnancy related I've asked him to do with me (and I haven't even asked him to come to my doctor appointments with me, so I don't think I'm asking for that much). I told him that when he says that, it makes me feel like this pregnancy is some big burden and inconvenience to him, when in reality I'm doing all the heavy lifting. He said no, he just hasn't had any time for himself. I reminded him that neither had I - I worked all day and didn't have a three-hour break between the end of my day and the birth meeting like he did. And I also didn't just come off of spending a week chilling with my friends and family, playing games and having fun. He replied that that didn't count as time for himself and it was exhausting. My response was that if it was so exhausting, he shouldn't have gone or should have gone for a shorter period of time so he could have relaxed at home during his break. He got really angry and left. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: husband came home and we had a long heart to heart. Apparently the trip was stressful for reasons other than just the travel (his mom thinks we're going to be terrible parents and he had to spend most of the time fending her off, so his nerves are frayed-they have a complicated relationship that I thought was fine now, but evidently not). He didn't want to tell me about the issues with his mom because he was worried the things she was saying would hurt my feelings (he wasn't wrong). So he got frustrated that I thought he was off having fun when he was actually having a hellish week. But he apologized because he realized there's no way I would have known that without him telling me.\n\nI told him I wanted to feel like we're a team and we're not communicating well with each other. And that we're also going to be tired when baby comes, but that doesn't mean we can shut down on each other. He agreed but also pointed out that he thinks baby exhaustion will be different than exhaustion from his mother. Hopefully he's right.\n\nI feel kind of dumb for posting now because this was all a miscommunication, but it was so unlike my husband to just storm off on me that I thought I must have done something wrong.

Your points are completely valid. I don't really understand what your husband wants as personal time? He had a week and wasted it (a conclusion drawn from his own statements)\n\nBeing a parent is hard, me-time wise (saying from experience) but you have to cope with it. Your husband is most probably not gonna get much time for the first two years after your kid is born, coz if he is an involved parent, well...even after that, spending time with the kid will be important to develop a relationship and not end up like the millions having parent issues.\n\nIt is a byproduct of pregnancy (to put it crudely), but you will have to sacrifice some of your personal time for your child (not all, some). IMHO, you should take a stand against your husband, have a serious discussion, maybe even get counselling, and set things straight", "NTA- he\u2019s in for rude awakening cause he will never have time for himself when the baby is born.", "NTA. Unfortunately it seems like you will be raising the baby alone.", "NTA\n\nFirst, you said he has complained about activities related to pregnancy before, so I don't think this is the stress from his mom.\n\nSecond, he should be wanting to go to your doctor's appointment. He is your partner! He is not behaving like a partner. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ASK HIM!!!! Having to ask him is more mental load. Your health and the baby's health should be of interest to him.\n\nFinally, I think baby exhaustion is worse than exhaustion from his mom. He was sleeping. He had time for himself. Baby exhaustion is worse because of the lack of sleep and having a baby screaming.\n\nHe needs to step up. You are doing all of the heavy lifting here.", "NTA. However, I know ill get downvoted for this but I\u2019m actually with you on the doctors appointments. 3 kids in and my husband only goes to the anatomy scan.

Making you feel like you and the pregnancy are a burden? Or being rude to you?\nCause with the update it sounds like he made an excuse for why your frustration wasn\u2019t valid (he didn\u2019t have fun because he was defending you from his mom) and then apologized for not telling you but also said what his mom had said hurting your feeling again. \nWhen the baby comes it\u2019s going to be worse not different, worse. I was jealous that my husbands commute was longer and he got to do it child free. At that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg of small frustrations and jealousy of small freedoms that we both had for each other.\nYou should ask for a real apology without excuses for why his vey was okay.", "NTA.

It only gets more time consuming and exhausting from here on out.", "After your update, I\u2019d say NAH. You are are both looking for support from each other because you are both feeling extremely stressed.

You both love each other and you are on the same team. \n\nHaving that heart-to-heart and being open to hearing each other\u2019s perspectives is a great first step in approaching the inevitable challenges that will come your way.

I\u2019m sure not being able to go didn\u2019t break his heart. \n\nI will never forget the expression on my husband\u2019s face when our daughter was born. He has been a devoted and loving father who puts the needs of his children above his own. My point is being pregnant and being a parent are different. Your husband has a lot on his plate.

I suggest making sure you have your support network in place before baby is here. \n\nPrep meals for freezer if you don't have anyone that can help cook. See if you have family that can help do a big clean before baby is here - you won't want to clean when baby arrives.\n\nPlan how you are going to cover nights. For my first, hubby sat up with baby from 8 to 12/1 to give me a solid 3-4 hours uninterrupted sleep. After that I took over night shift so that he could be fresh for work in the morning (I was on a year's maternity leave). I was then sometimes able to nap in day (I struggle with daytime sleep it's just not easy for me). \n\nHave discussions now on how you are going to parent if you have not already - I'm not a fan of sleep training. For me hearing my baby cry is soul distroying. I will always respond to him. Not everyone agrees with this and you will get a lot of judgement from others - best to work out how you both feel now. \n\nAlso for us, my hubby went along with my parenting choices because I was primary carer. Some partners want more input in decisions however I firmly believe that unless they are going to put it into practice they don't get deciding vote. If they are not the one that has to listen/deal with the screams they don't get to comment on how to handle it. Fortunately my hubby agrees with me for the most part. I do support his decisions as well.", "Saw your update.  \nCan I suggest you two invest a few couple's therapy sessions + parenting classes pre-baby?  \nYou said your husband has classes - if he's in university, the university probably offers highly subsidized mental health support.  \nMy biggest regret from uni is not taking advantage of things like that.", "NTA sounds like to tired parents to be having a bit of stress and having to work it out.

They'd generally involve unpaid time off work for the non-gestational parent, and are typically routine, and often make the non-gestational parent feel ignored/unwelcome - my partner came to my first and they just completely ignored him, it was really rude. He's come to all scans and came to the most recent appointment to hear the heartbeat, and he'll take me to get bloods, but it's not worth it for either of us to have him miss out on work so he can sit in a room and be ignored while nothing that interesting happens and I can report back to him later.\n\nDepending on where she is in the third trimester, that isn't a red flag either. A week before the due date would be idiotic, 29 weeks when they've both agreed to it in advance and presumably are having a low risk pregnancy is absolutely fine.\n\nJust because you wouldn't do something doesn't necessarily make it a red flag.", ">He left you alone when you\u2019re in your third trimester?! \ud83d\udea9 \n\nI'm just going to inject to this.
