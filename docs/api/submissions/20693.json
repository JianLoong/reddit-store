{"id": 20693, "submission_id": "14k09hy", "title": "AITA for telling my husband it's his fault he's tired?", "selftext": "I'm in my third trimester of pregnancy, first kid. My husband wanted to travel to visit his friends and family, knowing that once baby comes, he probably won't be able to see them for awhile. He is taking some summer courses to get an advanced degree, but had a weeklong break between classes.  I said okay, knowing I wouldn't be able to go with because of how busy I am at work (if my doctor would even sign off on me traveling).\n\nHe had a great time there, but had a miserable time traveling home for reasons outside of his control. He got home early yesterday (when he was supposed to be back late the night before) and was exhausted. He slept most of the day, got up, did some homework and played video games for a few hours, and then went back to bed.\n\nWhich brings us to today. He had class from 9-3. We had a meeting with a birth coach at 6, and the meeting lasted about two hours. Immediately after the meeting, he turned to me and said \"great, now I'm not going to have time to do anything tonight.\" \n\nThis isn't the first time he's said something like this after something birth/pregnancy related I've asked him to do with me (and I haven't even asked him to come to my doctor appointments with me, so I don't think I'm asking for that much). I told him that when he says that, it makes me feel like this pregnancy is some big burden and inconvenience to him, when in reality I'm doing all the heavy lifting. He said no, he just hasn't had any time for himself. I reminded him that neither had I - I worked all day and didn't have a three-hour break between the end of my day and the birth meeting like he did. And I also didn't just come off of spending a week chilling with my friends and family, playing games and having fun. He replied that that didn't count as time for himself and it was exhausting. My response was that if it was so exhausting, he shouldn't have gone or should have gone for a shorter period of time so he could have relaxed at home during his break. He got really angry and left. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: husband came home and we had a long heart to heart. Apparently the trip was stressful for reasons other than just the travel (his mom thinks we're going to be terrible parents and he had to spend most of the time fending her off, so his nerves are frayed-they have a complicated relationship that I thought was fine now, but evidently not). He didn't want to tell me about the issues with his mom because he was worried the things she was saying would hurt my feelings (he wasn't wrong). So he got frustrated that I thought he was off having fun when he was actually having a hellish week. But he apologized because he realized there's no way I would have known that without him telling me.\n\nI told him I wanted to feel like we're a team and we're not communicating well with each other. And that we're also going to be tired when baby comes, but that doesn't mean we can shut down on each other. He agreed but also pointed out that he thinks baby exhaustion will be different than exhaustion from his mother. Hopefully he's right.\n\nI feel kind of dumb for posting now because this was all a miscommunication, but it was so unlike my husband to just storm off on me that I thought I must have done something wrong.

I suggest making sure you have your support network in place before baby is here. \n\nPrep meals for freezer if you don't have anyone that can help cook. See if you have family that can help do a big clean before baby is here - you won't want to clean when baby arrives.\n\nPlan how you are going to cover nights. For my first, hubby sat up with baby from 8 to 12/1 to give me a solid 3-4 hours uninterrupted sleep. After that I took over night shift so that he could be fresh for work in the morning (I was on a year's maternity leave). I was then sometimes able to nap in day (I struggle with daytime sleep it's just not easy for me). \n\nHave discussions now on how you are going to parent if you have not already - I'm not a fan of sleep training. For me hearing my baby cry is soul distroying. I will always respond to him. Not everyone agrees with this and you will get a lot of judgement from others - best to work out how you both feel now. \n\nAlso for us, my hubby went along with my parenting choices because I was primary carer. Some partners want more input in decisions however I firmly believe that unless they are going to put it into practice they don't get deciding vote.

He's come to all scans and came to the most recent appointment to hear the heartbeat, and he'll take me to get bloods, but it's not worth it for either of us to have him miss out on work so he can sit in a room and be ignored while nothing that interesting happens and I can report back to him later.\n\nDepending on where she is in the third trimester, that isn't a red flag either. A week before the due date would be idiotic, 29 weeks when they've both agreed to it in advance and presumably are having a low risk pregnancy is absolutely fine.\n\nJust because you wouldn't do something doesn't necessarily make it a red flag.", ">He left you alone when you\u2019re in your third trimester?! \ud83d\udea9 \n\nI'm just going to object to this.

I know my husband went to our oldest\u2019s ultrasound but I couldn\u2019t say if he went to them for our younger two\u2019s with any certainty. If you want to be surprised by the gender together ask the tech to write it down and put it in an envelope. My husband went to some appointments but skipped a lot of them (sometimes to watch our kids so I could go by myself), and yet he\u2019s an amazing dad who spends tons of time with our kids and supported me through all kinds of hurdles with nursing and postpartum issues. Going to appointments before the baby is born isn\u2019t really that big of a deal if mom to be doesn\u2019t care. \n\nI\u2019d take my husband sitting at home feeling the baby kick while we sit on the couch over going to an appointment any day. Also, at least in the US, the more time you take off *before* baby is here for things like routine appointments the less time available to take off *after* baby is here. Give me dad helping post-partum over being at a prenatal appointment any day of the week. Some people\u2019s circumstances make it difficult to go to appointments with their partner. \n\nBeing left alone beginning of third trimester vs end of third trimester are very different things, and OP signed off on the trip. It\u2019d be a real AH thing to do to sign off on the trip then be resentful about it. Also, OP is an adult. Plenty of women go their entire pregnancy alone. Don\u2019t infantilize pregnant women.\n\nAnd finally, being tired isn\u2019t a competition. The most exhausting extended stretch of my life certainly wasn\u2019t after having a baby. It wasn\u2019t even having 3 5yo and under. Having a baby around is a lot of work, but it doesn\u2019t take away from someone else feeling tired. The whole, \u201cif you think you\u2019re tired now\u2026\u201d line isn\u2019t helpful to new parents, and doesn\u2019t even end up true in all cases. Just stop, it isn\u2019t a red flag to say you\u2019re tired just because you have the potential to be more tired. \n\nThis was a case of miscommunication plus OP\u2019s husband trying to shield OP from behavior he obviously identified as harmful from his mom. Humans are imperfect beings, everything isn\u2019t a red flag.", "Most appointments are in and out unless it's a high risk pregnancy or something like that. My fiance loves to go to them, but it also means he has.to take off work so i don't make him go. The only one I did say he had to go to was the anatomy scan. Not going to appointments isn't a red flag. Some couples are actually secure in their relationship and communicate with each other. And she didn't say what week she was in she could be the beginning of the third trimester with labor still far away. I feel like it's not really a big deal, unless like i mentioned earlier, a high risk pregnancy. To each their own \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nOP is still NTA", "Yup, went to every single one of my wife's appointments with both of our kids.", "My fianc\u00e9 works nights and will often take half a night off or stay up until we\u2019ve been to the appointment and then go to bed. He insists on being at every appointment even when I tell him he doesn\u2019t have to. OPs husband isn\u2019t even doing the bare minimum.", "Exactly the only reason my husband didn\u2019t go to my appointments was because I was pregnant in the middle of the pandemic and couldn\u2019t go inside, he took me to every single appointment and waited outside for me", "OP I\u2019ve seen your update and wanted to say these red flags are still redder than ever. I know you think this was a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d when all that happened was he gave you a sob story so you\u2019d forgive his low-key abusive behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s as simple as your husbands mistreats you when he\u2019s mildly stressed out. He\u2019s going to be mistreating you for YEARS when the baby comes.", "Lolol", "4 kids here and I agree. However his lack of desire to even want to go is reminiscent of my stb/ex of 15 yrs. He\u2019s actually an excellent dad from day one, support partner? Not so much.", "See her edits.  The idiot husband actually thinks the exhaustion from the new baby won\u2019t be the same as exhaustion from his mom lmao", "Just reading the initial post it's VERY obvious that this is typical both people are tired behaviour but you see the comments telling her to divorce him (lmao). Redditors are all like :  \"communication is key\",but as soon as they can get behind a narrative where someone is the \"bad one\" suddenly communicating becomes an afterthought.", "You're wording much better what I was trying to say. \nFor a lot of women, feeling a mother slowly starts already during pregnancy. For a lot of men, they start feeling a parent once they see the baby. A _lot_ of men cry when the baby is born. I think that is because of the overwhelming feeling of love and responsibility that kicks in at once. It's not the same for everyone, but quite a normal feeling.", "He just wants to be able to play his video games in peace it sounds like. And she seems to be pulling the majority of the weight to cover for him.\n\nPerhaps his mother has a point, and its going to surface when the going gets rough after the child arrives.", "Unfortunately this was my thought also.", ">being tired isn\u2019t a competition\n\n100 per cent.  Comparing tirednesses is pointless and annoying and amplifies resentment pretty quickly (source: mother of two here). Wishing you all the best, OP, for a happy pregnancy and birth.", "This is an adult response. \nSeriously, even if the husband didn't react well, we all can have a bad day or sometimes say things we regret. \n\nMy husband never went to appointments with me and I don't care. A pregnant woman is not ill. When our kids were born, he went to doctors appointments alone with them, far more important imo. \nAlso, not all men react the same on a pregnancy. My husband was the first to want a baby and he supported me very much when I needed rest etc. But when I asked him to feel the baby kicking he wasn't interested for more than a few minutes.\n\nI agree so much that being tired is not a competition. OP and her husband need to work together on this. I know my man has trouble falling asleep again once he's woken up at night. So he sometimes went to the couch to get a good night of sleep. I could fall asleep 2 minutes after the baby slept again. So no problem to wake up and feed the baby 2 or 3 times a night. And after such nights, my husband was happy to get up at 6 to take care of the kids a few hours so I could sleep in till 8.30. If you can be a team together and be glad to help each other, it's so much easier.", "The competition over being tired is what jumped out at me.\nThey're both not communicating well.\n\nTurning every gripe into a competition is incredibly toxic. He can be tired and she can be tired. They're separate things. Maybe his tired doesn't warrant a full orchestra of violins but turning it into a competition instantly shut down any possibility of a meaningful conversation about the underlying issues going on", "Agreed. I have the most wonderful, supportive and loving man you could ever dream of but I told him there was no point in taking off work (he owns his own business and works his ass off for us) because there is nothing they do at some of these appointments except measure my weight, belly and check the heart beat. I always asked what the next appointment would be and if it was a scan or blood draw he was there but otherwise he isn\u2019t missing anything. \nNot saying OPs guy doesn\u2019t have red flags but this just isn\u2019t one of them in my opinion.", "How dare you have a level headed take on the standard Reddit \"you guys had an argument, better leave him\" response?", "Often they make the partner wait outside for part of it as well so they can ask the pregnant person if they are being abused.", "So you\u2019re telling me you drove yourself to your appointments in the third trimester? Clearly you\u2019re fine but that\u2019s kind of reckless. My doctors told me not to drive after 30 weeks", "Early labor is pretty common, even in healthy pregnancies.", "Yeah, don't let them scare you about this. Not everyone feels the need to treat a pregnancy like it's this earth-shattering thing. You do you! And your update is really heartening, keep up the good communication between each other and keep his mother at arm's length or even go no contact. There's no need to prove to her that you're doing fine as parents, which I'm sure you will be.\n\nGood luck with the rest of your pregnancy, the birth and your baby!", "I think the point people were trying to make is that he is not even that involved in the pregnancy and is still complaining. He is not even going to your medical appointments and still it\u2019s too much for him. He should just be more interested in general. We all get that not everybody is able to take time off, but they should want to if they could. When he will have a baby, he won\u2019t have that much time to himself in the evening. Does he expect you to do all appointments on your own? It just seems like he does not want to be responsible for the child", "OP,  don't panick. If you listen to Reddit, you can call the lawyer, freeze your savings and call for divorce on every minor misunderstanding. \n\nPeople have to learn and grow together if they want to spent their lives together. It's not about making mistakes (of course I don't mean violence or trustbreaking issues, but the normal stuff), it's about how you handle it and communicate about it. It sounds you did well afterwards. \nAlso, everyone is different and every country is different. Where I live it's not usual to go to every doctors appointment together. Maybe because women are strong and independent and pregnancy isn't seen as an illness here? \n\nIt sounds very reasonable that your husband wants to save the money and the time off for more important things. \n\nMaybe your husband reacted wrong, and maybe you did too by comparing the level of tiredness. Try to laugh about it and make sure you both get your sleep the next days. Being tired is never good for reading a situation well.", "\u2026. As the other parent, he should be involved in your doctor appointments without even needing to be asked\u2026 but whatever if you like it, i love it", "You didn't ask him because you knew how he would respond, making it about how tired he was after the appointment, how his mother would react, and not supportive at all...you didn't ask because you didn't want him to ruin the moments you had with your pregnancy. \n\nI truly hope he turns it around once that baby is in his arms.", "You shouldn't have to ask.", "Yeah... it'll be fucking worse. By a long shot.", "That was my thought.  His mom seems to be correct.", "Exactly, my ex husband came to the scans but I was happy to go solo on everything else as they were really just monitoring me and a quick fifteen minutes that I'd fit in during my day. Unnecessary for him to arrange his whole work day around a non appointment.", "But not at the begining of the third trimester. How many people do you know, who went into labor at 30 weeks, when everything was fine before?", "With this logic, he should be by her side 24/7 and quit his job to keep an eye on her at all times -.-", "That doesn't mean he needs to stick by her side the entire 3rd trimester. The last month or so, yes he shouldnt be too far away. Months 7 & 8 - off with ya.", "For a lot of men the pregnancy is a very different experience than for women. Some men are very much involved, others a bit less. He goes to the important appointments with OP. We don't know what else he does, maybe he reads about pregnancy an parenting, or he paints baby's room. We can't judge that. And not being at all appointments and expressing he's tired doesn't mean he won't be involved or responsible as a father.", "How are you still parroting this redditism when she\u2019s clearly updated he went to some of the appointments but can\u2019t go to the others cuz work. Sounds like they both have busy schedules. And in the update it sounds like they\u2019re fine. So how you can glean his interest level or how much he loves her and wants the baby from a sentence he said, is beyond me. Just a total Reddit moment", "I'm a wife not a husband but damn if my wife was pregnant (my partner is the one who's going to be pregnant when we are ready) and I truly couldn't make the appointments, my partner would at least know I wanted to - I want to be there. I hate that I have this work thing on or this school thing. I wish it wasn't the case. Tell me how it goes okay? I would want to go every time because what if one of those times doesn't go so well? I want to be there to hold my partners hand. Or celebrate when we get updates. \n\nEven if we truly couldn't afford to both go, my wife would at least be able to tell others \"My partner really wanted to be here.\" and know that instead of guessing.", "This. My prenatal appointments always fell during my husband's busiest work hours because that was when my favorite ob was in the office, he was never able to physically make an appointment and always felt THE MOST terrible about it. Frankly I hate prenatal check ups and being poked and prodded at, there was only one ob in the office that didn't completely try to steam roll me into having a medicated birth, and I was glad my hubby wasn't tagging along. This man cried because he'd had flights and hotels booked for a solid year to visit his dad in Florida and the only time we could do the anatomy scan was the day he was flying back, I took his BEST friend and we videochatted him from the scan so he could be there in spirit. He just spent the last two months making sure he was booked out for our babies latest well check. \n\nHeavily judging op's husband's me me me attitude. But I am a spoiled rotten princess with a husband who worships the ground I walk upon, makes sure he's front center and present for our lives and as a parent (to his bonus kid too since hes the only father my 6 year old has ever known), and is always happy to be there. Seeing posts like this make me so sad to see what people are settling for because well it's not abuse... because I married my best friend and we are equal partners on a united front... he doesn't watch the kids as a favor, he parents because that's what he is.", "Yup.\n\nThere can be about a zillion appointments and most are very boring and fall during standard work hours.\n\nSave that time for when the baby shows up. \n\nAn involved father can be supportive in so many other ways that don't involve attending a million routine appointments.", "This. I didn\u2019t have to ask my husband because he wanted and fully expected to be apart of anything baby related. We was just as excited as I was for our daughter and wanted to support me by being by my side for all appointments. He worked nights but still made time to go to appointments even if it meant staying up later and missing out on sleep. You shouldn\u2019t have to ask him to be involved in anything related to the life he helped create.", "Damn you're stupid", "Three, not including myself, either way I wasn\u2019t saying she should be watched like a child I was just saying that there is a chance that preterm labor could happen to anyone because the original comment seemed to be implying that every pregnancy goes to full term.", "I didn\u2019t say anything about him being with her 24/7 I was just stating that early labor is common. No, he shouldn\u2019t quit his job to babysit her, even though I never said he should ?", "God I hope I get what you have one day", "You said that early labor is common even in healthy pregnancies... so with that logic she may go into labor early. Which means that someone needs to be with her 24/7 incase said labor should come early.", "Know your worth, hold it close, don't settle for less.

Relationships are like farts, if you have to force them its probably shit. \n\nI didnt want a second baby or husband. I clawed my way out of an abusive relationship with my oldest and stayed single. By the time my husband and I went from friendly neighbors to hooking up casually it would have taken someone who shat rainbows for me to give up my solitude for a relationship.

Not be with her 24/7 because he would still be relatively close if something like that were to happen.", "It\u2019s not rocket science. No doctor is gonna suggest a vacation in the third trimester, not because she needs a babysitter but because if she needs ANYTHING someone (preferably the father) needs to available. \nOnce you hit the third tri and baby is full grown, a fart can send you into labor", "Agree with all of this.
