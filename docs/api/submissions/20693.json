{"id": 20693, "submission_id": "14k09hy", "title": "AITA for telling my husband it's his fault he's tired?", "selftext": "I'm in my third trimester of pregnancy, first kid. My husband wanted to travel to visit his friends and family, knowing that once baby comes, he probably won't be able to see them for awhile. He is taking some summer courses to get an advanced degree, but had a weeklong break between classes.  I said okay, knowing I wouldn't be able to go with because of how busy I am at work (if my doctor would even sign off on me traveling).\n\nHe had a great time there, but had a miserable time traveling home for reasons outside of his control. He got home early yesterday (when he was supposed to be back late the night before) and was exhausted. He slept most of the day, got up, did some homework and played video games for a few hours, and then went back to bed.\n\nWhich brings us to today. He had class from 9-3. We had a meeting with a birth coach at 6, and the meeting lasted about two hours. Immediately after the meeting, he turned to me and said \"great, now I'm not going to have time to do anything tonight.\" \n\nThis isn't the first time he's said something like this after something birth/pregnancy related I've asked him to do with me (and I haven't even asked him to come to my doctor appointments with me, so I don't think I'm asking for that much). I told him that when he says that, it makes me feel like this pregnancy is some big burden and inconvenience to him, when in reality I'm doing all the heavy lifting. He said no, he just hasn't had any time for himself. I reminded him that neither had I - I worked all day and didn't have a three-hour break between the end of my day and the birth meeting like he did. And I also didn't just come off of spending a week chilling with my friends and family, playing games and having fun. He replied that that didn't count as time for himself and it was exhausting. My response was that if it was so exhausting, he shouldn't have gone or should have gone for a shorter period of time so he could have relaxed at home during his break. He got really angry and left. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: husband came home and we had a long heart to heart. Apparently the trip was stressful for reasons other than just the travel (his mom thinks we're going to be terrible parents and he had to spend most of the time fending her off, so his nerves are frayed-they have a complicated relationship that I thought was fine now, but evidently not). He didn't want to tell me about the issues with his mom because he was worried the things she was saying would hurt my feelings (he wasn't wrong). So he got frustrated that I thought he was off having fun when he was actually having a hellish week. But he apologized because he realized there's no way I would have known that without him telling me.\n\nI told him I wanted to feel like we're a team and we're not communicating well with each other. And that we're also going to be tired when baby comes, but that doesn't mean we can shut down on each other. He agreed but also pointed out that he thinks baby exhaustion will be different than exhaustion from his mother. Hopefully he's right.\n\nI feel kind of dumb for posting now because this was all a miscommunication, but it was so unlike my husband to just storm off on me that I thought I must have done something wrong.

I suggest making sure you have your support network in place before baby is here. \n\nPrep meals for freezer if you don't have anyone that can help cook. See if you have family that can help do a big clean before baby is here - you won't want to clean when baby arrives.\n\nPlan how you are going to cover nights. For my first, hubby sat up with baby from 8 to 12/1 to give me a solid 3-4 hours uninterrupted sleep. After that I took over night shift so that he could be fresh for work in the morning (I was on a year's maternity leave). I was then sometimes able to nap in day (I struggle with daytime sleep it's just not easy for me). \n\nHave discussions now on how you are going to parent if you have not already - I'm not a fan of sleep training. For me hearing my baby cry is soul distroying. I will always respond to him. Not everyone agrees with this and you will get a lot of judgement from others - best to work out how you both feel now. \n\nAlso for us, my hubby went along with my parenting choices because I was primary carer. Some partners want more input in decisions however I firmly believe that unless they are going to put it into practice they don't get deciding vote.

He's come to all scans and came to the most recent appointment to hear the heartbeat, and he'll take me to get bloods, but it's not worth it for either of us to have him miss out on work so he can sit in a room and be ignored while nothing that interesting happens and I can report back to him later.\n\nDepending on where she is in the third trimester, that isn't a red flag either. A week before the due date would be idiotic, 29 weeks when they've both agreed to it in advance and presumably are having a low risk pregnancy is absolutely fine.\n\nJust because you wouldn't do something doesn't necessarily make it a red flag.", ">He left you alone when you\u2019re in your third trimester?! \ud83d\udea9 \n\nI'm just going to object to this.

I know my husband went to our oldest\u2019s ultrasound but I couldn\u2019t say if he went to them for our younger two\u2019s with any certainty. If you want to be surprised by the gender together ask the tech to write it down and put it in an envelope. My husband went to some appointments but skipped a lot of them (sometimes to watch our kids so I could go by myself), and yet he\u2019s an amazing dad who spends tons of time with our kids and supported me through all kinds of hurdles with nursing and postpartum issues. Going to appointments before the baby is born isn\u2019t really that big of a deal if mom to be doesn\u2019t care. \n\nI\u2019d take my husband sitting at home feeling the baby kick while we sit on the couch over going to an appointment any day. Also, at least in the US, the more time you take off *before* baby is here for things like routine appointments the less time available to take off *after* baby is here. Give me dad helping post-partum over being at a prenatal appointment any day of the week. Some people\u2019s circumstances make it difficult to go to appointments with their partner. \n\nBeing left alone beginning of third trimester vs end of third trimester are very different things, and OP signed off on the trip. It\u2019d be a real AH thing to do to sign off on the trip then be resentful about it. Also, OP is an adult. Plenty of women go their entire pregnancy alone. Don\u2019t infantilize pregnant women.\n\nAnd finally, being tired isn\u2019t a competition. The most exhausting extended stretch of my life certainly wasn\u2019t after having a baby. It wasn\u2019t even having 3 5yo and under. Having a baby around is a lot of work, but it doesn\u2019t take away from someone else feeling tired. The whole, \u201cif you think you\u2019re tired now\u2026\u201d line isn\u2019t helpful to new parents, and doesn\u2019t even end up true in all cases.

Not going to appointments isn't a red flag. Some couples are actually secure in their relationship and communicate with each other.

A lot of men start feeling a parent once they see the baby. A _lot_ of men cry when the baby is born.

A pregnant woman is not ill. When our kids were born, he went to doctors appointments alone with them, far more important imo. \nAlso, not all men react the same on a pregnancy. My husband was the first to want a baby and he supported me very much when I needed rest etc. But when I asked him to feel the baby kicking he wasn't interested for more than a few minutes.\n\nI agree so much that being tired is not a competition. OP and her husband need to work together on this. I know my man has trouble falling asleep again once he's woken up at night. So he sometimes went to the couch to get a good night of sleep. I could fall asleep 2 minutes after the baby slept again. So no problem to wake up and feed the baby 2 or 3 times a night. And after such nights, my husband was happy to get up at 6 to take care of the kids a few hours so I could sleep in till 8.30.

He is not even going to your medical appointments and still it\u2019s too much for him. He should just be more interested in general. We all get that not everybody is able to take time off, but they should want to if they could. When he will have a baby, he won\u2019t have that much time to himself in the evening.

The medics appointments were fine without him.", "you're right about being very accommodating to him-It's just pretty clear to me that he's taking advantage of that fact, and you have to wonder how long that will go on for...", "It must be so nice in your world. \n\nA world where severe medical anxiety doesn't exist, where all employers are happy to allow their employees all the time in the world to watch their partner get a blood test and where discussing mucus plugs and haemorrhoids with your partner sitting next to you is your idea of an amazing conversation. \n\nBe realistic, he isn't required at the doctor's appointments and if she doesn't ask him she probably doesn't care. Seeing as she is an adult with the ability of higher thought why don't we trust her on that. FYI calling a grown adult you don't know sweetheart gives me the ick, it is so condescending.", "NTA. Sounds like this is actually your second baby....", "I\u2018m totally in the same boat here, communication is key in a relationship and that\u2019s something that has to be learned - it is not easy to open up for your partner. Especially when you try to protect him / her from something (like his mother\u2019s comments) it is not easy to give enough information for the partner to understand your behavior without making your partner worried. \n\nI think he did well with reflecting his own behavior and coming back to apologize and explaining his behavior. \n\nOP obviously also did well, because she tries to understand whether she has done something wrong, instead of just being mad at him. In this case, she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, but maybe in the future she will and then she is in turn of reflecting her behavior.\n\nAll in all I think they will be a great team and @ OP: I wish you, your husband and your soon-to-be newborn all the best. You\u2018ll do great!", "\u2026..what? He doesn\u2019t help her with the pregnancy or go to doctors appointments. I feel like that\u2019s a big issue??", "I'm just curious, if it's personal then I'm sorry for asking but what was the most exhausting extended stretch? I only ask bcos I have medical issues and people say stuff like oh if you cant do this you wont cope with kids and stuff but like I raised my sister and was up all night with her for months on end and yeah it's tiring but it's a different kind of tiring than other things I've been through and I feel like I could cope better with kid tired than the other kind and yeah", "Yeah agreed. My husband went to the scans and anything I needed support for, but he didn't need to come to the midwife appointments. In the UK it can actually sometimes be seen as a bit of a red flag having the other half come to those as it can be seen as controlling. They actually ask \"how things are at home\" to check for signs of DV. Obviously, if the husband is there and they are abusive that question can't really be asked.", "Exactly this. My partner wouldn't be paid for his time off, and every appointment other than the ultrasounds was boring and short .. aka not worth the time off work. \n\nHe attended one appointment with our midwife and all ultrasounds he was allowed to attend and has been an excellent and involved dad to our daughter.", "My husband has been invaluable in my appointments. He remembers questions that I forget and has been a huge part of the process.

Also self employed, I know the absolute damage taking days off can cause. It's easy to say \"just take the day off for this one important thing\", but honestly, after doing them so many times I can honestly say in hindsight, some of these things aren't that important.. and I lost out a few very good clients and their money, cause I took the days off. \n\nIt's easy to sit back and say \"it's only money\", but it's that money that buys the pram, the cotz the clothes, all the consumable stuff, all the food, all the accessories, all the stupid shit the internet says you need, but after 3 kids I can say honestly you don't need.. \n\nEveryone needs to chill.

I told my husband from the start that if he would like to come to an appointment, he is welcome to, but that I recommend the 20 week scan. I've had 9 MFM (ultrasound) appointments, and 9 OB appts so far at only 20 weeks. It would be crazy to expect both of us to miss that much work!", "My fianc\u00e9 came to every single appointment and asked questions and took notes, and held my hand. The appointments typically lasted 1-2 hours so he'd use his lunch hours and go in early/leave later on those days! We were really fortunate he could do that. \n\nOPs husband just sounds like he doesn't give a flying fuck about the baby or OP, even with her edit.", "This. My husband wasn\u2019t allowed at the appointments except for one. There he had to sit outside the doctors office to wait for most of the time. He wasn\u2019t even allowed in the waiting room.", "I agree I had to get bloods taken every 2 weeks throughout both my pregnancies, if my husband came to every one of those appointments he would have used all his holidays and would only have had the one week unpaid paternity leave when the babies actually arrived", "Let me help you save yourself some time and teach you a couple new words: mother, and father.", "I completely agree with this. I\u2019m currently 38 weeks and I go to my OB and other doctor appointments by myself. He went to all three of my scans because he wanted to see bub, but the other appointments just seemed a bit excessive to me. Also, I had an emergency where I fell over at 25 weeks and he left work to take me to the hospital. So I think it\u2019s a case-by-case basis.", "Well, that being said. The one thing I didn't like is how he voiced he's tired, and you kind of immediately made it a competition. You being more exhausted doenst negate his exhaustion or ability to complain especially since you're different people. But everyone here is just hopping on the upvote train. Don't divorce this man just improve your communication both ways.", "My husband offers to come if I want him to go, but he knows that unless I need the moral support if he's busy he's allowed to be busy", "Because this is reddit. Most of the people here aren't even married and doesn't even understand family & work responsibilities \n\nIf your husband took a lof of time off, it can cause a discourse with his boss, and it'll effect his job, which will effect income.\n\nBeing more understanding of each other is the best way here.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to ask him. He should WANT to come. My husband never missed one appointment even though I never asked him to come along with me. He was excited for every single one of them because he couldn\u2019t wait to \u201csee\u201d her growing inside of me. Im sad you\u2019re still defending him and can\u2019t see all of these red flags. I hope he\u2019ll be better once the baby arrives. Saying that it isn\u2019t fair for us to judge him is weird because you\u2019re posting this on Reddit for the whole world to read and have an opinion on the situation.", "You don\u2019t have to ask him. From my experience future fathers are EXCITED to go, I know one who had a big fight with his supervisor because he wouldn\u2019t let him take the time off to go to the obgyn appointments with his pregnant wife. Even the ones who aren\u2019t excited to attend the pre-birth classes, I don\u2019t think would ever dream of reproaching their wives for not having time for themselves. Your husband needs a wake-up call.", "Why should you have to ask him to go to doctors appointments for HIS child? This guy sounds like a real AH tbh.....", "Not the same, one is exhaustion for caring after your child who you love. The other one is exhaustiong from someone, who you already have a difficult relationship with, berating you nonstop. The exhaustion from the child might feel worth it whereas the one from this mom won't. So definitely not the same on a mental level, which goes a long way.

There were also signs in toilets at the midwife clinic on what subtle cues you could give if you needed help!", "And the UK is just as fucked up as the US I guess.", "I'm not saying everyone does. But it's not uncommon and it's not fun. I'm also not saying you shouldn't do it if you both want to, no matter the attitude you might get. I just personally think it's very valid to not want to take hours of unpaid time off work to sit in a room and be pointedly ignored, which is the reality for a lot of non-gestational parents, so I don't think it alone is a red flag. \n\nPersonally I think non-gestational partners should be welcomed and made to feel involved, and I'm envious of people who do get that, because unfortunately it isn't the norm.\n\nThat said, it might be helpful for you (or both of you) to have a note in your phone with questions - you can add to it between your appointments and just delete anything that isn't relevant at the appointment or they cover before you ask. I have a calendar in one of the apps I use (Pregnancy Tracker) where I can add notes, so I always add notes for the next appointments, what to expect from them, and any questions I have to ask at them.", "What, they do? Genuine question!", "Seriously though. I\u2019d rather my husband have time off to add to the end of his paternity leave. Half of my appointments are a piss test, and a quick look over. He comes to my main ultrasounds but missing a day for a 30 minute appointment is just silly to me. Even the red flag for travel is weird to me. In all three of my pregnancies I\u2019ve traveled by myself many times, and my husband also traveled by himself, both of us doing so up until 37 weeks. I\u2019m sympathetic to some people needing extra support, but some people just take it way too far.", "I agree OP's husband doesn't sound like he's being great, I was just commenting that purely not going to appointments isn't necessarily a red flag. There's also such a massive difference between discussing it and deciding together it's not worth them there vs knowing they won't, or they will if you insist but it's a battle and they're going to try and make you feel like crap after because they don't feel it was a good use of their time.", "No thanks, gestational and non-gestational parent capture what I'm trying to say exactly.", "Is this a joke? Sorry, I honestly can't tell. \ud83d\ude42 Most pregnant women don't get chauffeured around after 30 weeks, at least not in my experience.", ">Clearly you\u2019re fine but that\u2019s kind of reckless.\n\nWhat the hell? No it isn't.", "Was there a specific reason why driving would have been a risk for you? There is absolutely no reason a person experiencing a low risk pregnancy should stop driving at 30 weeks. \n\nHell I was still flying to and from work weekly at that point with my medical teams full knowledge.", "I'm sorry, but that has to be an exception. I'm 36 weeks and my life barely change (and my pregnancy is considered high risk because I'm over 40). I work, clean the house, drive, and practically forced my husband to see his family in a different country because he won't have much time after. Obviously all this happens because I feel great, otherwise it would be different. But we have to stop treating pregnancy like it's a disease and also stop infantilising pregnant women - we are still independent adults.", "I'm not quite there yet, but a) lots of people are absolutely fine to drive in the third trimester b) my GP is a 2 minute walk away, no one's driving me to appointments and c) I don't and won't have weekly appointments unless I go over my due date, so again, being away for a week that they've both agreed on is no issue.", "What kind of doctor do you have \ud83d\ude02 That\u2019s outrageous \ud83d\ude02", "Not three months early it's not.", "It's really not very common. The chance of going into labour before 31wks is less than 1%.", "Anything can happen at any point in pregnancy, as anything can happen when you're not pregnant. Pregnant women are still independent adults and pregnancy is not a disease.", "I asked one of my brothers wife about that stuff and she said it is considered weird that my brother came with her, he wanted to come, but doctors etc were weird about him being there, cultural differences I guess.", "I wouldn't be surprised if his mother didn't say that \"they\" would be bad parents, but said that \"he\" would be, during the week he left his wife alone to hang out with his friends. I wouldn't be surprised if he satyed with his mom and behaved like a child.", "Never had that in any occasion over 3 children. I was always in the scan room. \n\nAfter knowing a midwife however, she's told me that sometimes they can smell a dodgy situation, and might ask the lady to come in alone for those questions. \n\n\nSo ....... They probs thought that was the case.", "Yeah they take it seriously. They also do it after the birth. My wife told me that whilst I went to the shop to grab us food after her giving birth the second I was round the corner a midwife was in the room to ask questions about whether I was abusive, or she was living in a dangerous situation. Right thing to do tbh, I get the feeling you're more likely to get an honest answer put of someone who's too exhausted to lie than at any other time.", "Yes & it\u2019s because DV from men to women is most likely to start during pregnancy, for a multitude of different reasons. (woman is more vulnerable, man feels he is losing power + control \u2014 many men talk about feeling jealous of the baby, etc)", "For me, it was at the scans rather than the normal appointments. I was on blood thinners for blood pressure at the time and had a massive bruise on my butt from a fall. That took some talking my way out of!", "Yeah o haven\u2019t had this happen at all. Maybe some people do but it\u2019s not universal.", "No it\u2019s because if you get into a car accident you\u2019re more likely to kill your baby because your belly WILL hit the steering wheel. Maybe it\u2019s because of how many accidents my city had, but no it\u2019s because of car accidents.", "I\u2019m literally pregnant right now, never said it was a disease and never said pregnant women aren\u2019t independent adults. People can stop acting like I said she needs a bodyguard or something.", "Shit I\u2019ve traveled bi-weekly by myself in all of pregnancies up to 37 weeks\u2026 people get really weird about travel.

It's what this sub does best.", "Yep, this is my theory too.", "Oh wow, that\u2019s something I never knew. I\u2019m glad they do that. You never know what situation someone is in!", "Ummm this is not standar procedure.. something made them think your wife was in an abusive relationship.", "I think it's a standard question in Australia, or some of the states at least", "Never heard that before, but I believe you. Not the rule anywhere I've lived though.", "Okay you know a lot of outliers then. Please learn the difference between anecdotes and proper data. And statistics.", "Wife says this (asking if you are in an abusive situation) is standard of most doctor appointments, not just ones dealing with pregnancy. Of course sometimes you get the either really dumb or uncaring nurse who asks the patient when their partner is still in the room smh", "Doctors ask that during regular checkups in the US. Ive been asked multiple times, as has my male partner.", "Not true. Women are advised to not travel after 36 weeks because air companies don't allow it, there's nothing dangerous about it. I practically had to force my husband to go see his family (different country, a 9h flight away) when I was 34 weeks pregnant. I don't have a support system where we live, what I do have is a phone and a brain and I can use both to reach the hospital if I need it. I'm growing a child inside me, I'm not a child myself.\n\nETA - I did the 9h trip myself, by myself, once in the 2nd trimester and once in the 3rd trimester. Doctor was happy with it, just warned me about airlines (but gave me a letter stating that I was fit to fly) and I got an anticoagulant injection before the flight (administered by me) and compression socks, just for precaution.", "There\u2019s nothing dangerous about going into labor in an airplane? I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t have a support system but did you consult your ob about this before hand. That\u2019s so dangerous a simple slip in the shower could have stopped you from being able to get up and reach a phone. You could have randomly swollen up, stroke, fainting, blood clots. All of these thing happen in the third tri, in the third tri it\u2019s not about you at all. Anything, literally anything can happen. No physician is gonna say go, they know risk. They won\u2019t stop thou."]}
