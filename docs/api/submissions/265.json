P ended up dropping the second class we had together, so we go to the one we still have and then P goes home (or sometimes tries to get me to skip the class they dropped). I have nothing personal against P, but we do not have anything more than a small talk, surface level relationship, with the occasional weekend story. Most of our conversations are P telling me how tired they are and they hate the class and want to go home. P says this to me legitimately maybe every 10 minutes and after a certain point I just stop responding because there\u2019s only so many different responses I can come up with, and frankly it gets pretty annoying considering I enjoy going to the lecture and really want to do well in school this year. P always wants to sit in the back corner and talks through the whole lecture, and I don\u2019t respond most of the time but P doesn\u2019t seem to want to take the hint. I\u2019m not great at confrontation which is why I haven\u2019t really said anything, but it\u2019s getting to the point where me sitting with P is definitely impacting my understanding of the course content. Today, instead of meeting P where we normally meet, I stayed in a different building after my first class and got some notes done. When I got to class, I went in a different door on the bottom level (classroom is two levels with a balcony, P always want to be on the balcony so I knew they wouldn\u2019t be there) and sat in a close enough seat to be able to see, but far enough back that P couldn\u2019t look down to see me. I had the most productive lecture I have ever had for that course and now I don\u2019t know how to tell her I want to start sitting alone. Like I said, our relationship is very surface level so I was honestly thinking of just (as bad as it sounds) ditching her for the whole week and hope she gets the hint.
