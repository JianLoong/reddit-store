That may mean that you have more money than the standard student's parent. And your husband may want to fit in with the other parents to make it easier to make friends, or prevent your child from being ostracized.\n\nLet me tell you - I am a single mother to children in primary school, regularly wearing active wear, and I would LOVE seeing another mother dressed the nines. I'd be jealous, but in a good way of wishing I could do that. As long as you don't sneer at or actively make the other mothers feel they aren't doing enough - you go mama! And saying you looked like you just walked off the set of Sex and the City was a total compliment! Continue your fashion show please!", "NTA!!\u2026.haters gonna hate hate hate!!! you just shake, shake, shake it off!!!", "Go off, you print loving queen. \n\nWhen will folks realize that so much of our appearance is for us and not other folks?", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your husband should be ecstatic that you care about your appearance and put in effort. So many don\u2019t these days (men and women). My wife is like you to a degree, though it sounds like you both have very different styles, and I\u2019m proud of her. She doesn\u2019t go overboard but the effort is apparent and she\u2019s beautiful. We\u2019re not far off from you in age.", "NTA, it sounds like the only person with a problem with it is your husband and that sounds like insecurity with his own lack of care for his appearance", "NTA. I\u2019d probably hate you though. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI had to go to my daughter\u2019s band concert a few months ago straight from work and I literally cried in my car afterwards because of the pretty moms.\n(I wouldn\u2019t *really* hate you but I\u2019d be super jealous.)", "NTA. \n\nHowever, as the mom who is often dropping off in her PJ pants, I often look at women like you and wonder why you seem to have it all together while I'm still huddled over my coffee mug and wondering where the hell my slippers are.", "Sounds like a bunch of haters to me. Nta.", "NTA. When my son first started school there was a mom I clearly remember as always being dressed up hair done, make-up done. I didn\u2019t judge or or feel judged by her. I thought she looked incredible! \n\nI think if it\u2019s what you like then why not!", "He loved your style in the past because he thought it made HIM look good. \n\nHe no longer likes your style because he thinks it makes HIM look bad. \n\nFuck what he thinks. You're not an ornament or accessory. You can wear what you like just because it makes you feel good as long as it's occaaion-appropriate.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI rarely dress up.  I am all about comfort.  I admit, I'd probably think you were a little weird dressing up to go to casual school functions but that'd be my problem, not yours.  You might think I'm a slob.  w/e.  This is definitely a first world problem and I wouldn't spend 1 more minute worrying about it.", "> I always look like I just walked of the set of Sex and the City\n\nThe key is whether she meant Samantha or Charlotte. You can't just go assuming that this is positive without asking the important question.", "You know what? Even if some of the parents are initially intimidated by your style, once they get to know you, that won't matter anymore. If you treat people well, they will relax around you and love you. I personally would love to see your outfits (though I would certainly be intimidated at first)!", "NTA. I dress very casual 99% of the time and when I see other women dressed up at my kid's school or the doctor's office or whatever, I don't care. They can wear whatever they want. As long as they aren't giving me shit for not dressing up I don't give a flying horse's ass.", "I agree 100%! I was thinking of Grace Hanson from Grace & Frankie - OP rock those power clothes for as long as you want", "This is so true. I am 100% still on the grind and will be for a long time. Do you know what I call my crocs? They are my \u201cI\u2019ve given up on life\u201d shoes. No joke.", "Lol yes we do. Is this meant to be a joke and I missed it?", "That\u2019s a bunch of crap. I bought into that until I started traveling more extensively. Europeans most definitely dress down in public. And no, I do not go to touristy areas.", "Omg, tell us more about this penis tattoo situation!", "Let your children see you as you. It\u2019s okay to be unique.", "I volunteer at my kid's school. Yeah, a couple will wear a tasteful sun dress or a skirt on a hot day, but a whole lot of them just wear jeans and t-shirts. And some of these teachers are wearing leggings, FFS. \n\nMe, I generally look like I just stumbled out of a Nirvana concert in 1992.", "You cannot pee in them without getting nearly naked. They are WAY overrated IMHO. I like getting dressed up, but prefer skirts personally.\n\nBut, you do you MyIT. That's why there are so many choices.", "The only problem I have with jumpsuits is that it makes it a little hard to use the bathroom", "It was definitely a compliment. People don't say things like that in an insulting way, and I would bet good money that a teacher wouldn't be judging a parent for dressing up too much anyway, at least not in the way OP seems to be dressing up (if it was mini skirts and 4-inch stilettos, maybe a teacher would judge her, but tea length skirts and nice heels isn't something most people would judge her for). OP's husband is either jealous of the attention that OP is getting, or trying to bring her down a peg.", "Please don't change what you like doing!", "She didn\u2019t say she\u2019s dressing like she\u2019s going to a club. She said she wears long calf length skirts or nice pants, and jumpsuit is a full body covering garment. She just wants to look nice and it sounds like she does it in a really classy way. Do you think she should just be wearing jeans and t shirts all the time?", "This is a \"[tea lenght skirt](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg1.etsystatic.com%2F060%2F0%2F7046473%2Fil_fullxfull.729492991_b6mu.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=02fa44fbd578234fc518873ed44447899bbcb69bd62333dc623bfa18fb8e02ed&ipo=images)\", for your education. Unless that club is set in the 50s, I think that going clubbing is not exactly the mood here.", "Harsh.", "Nailed it", "Ding ding ding!!!!", "We could be friends. Spot on lol", "I love the way they look, but yeah, that's why I don't wear them."]}
