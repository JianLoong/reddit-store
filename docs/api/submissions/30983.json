I totally understand that, and have been there. As a single mom of three on disability, I do have a couple tricks and tips to help you dress in a way that makes you feel more put together, if you want. If you don't, please feel free to disregard the following. And if you do, feel free to cherry pick what works for you. This is just what works for me.\n\nA) always remember that fashionable does NOT mean uncomfortable. Everything I wear is very comfortable. To the point where I could (and have) fall asleep in 95% of my clothing. \n\nB) thrift stores and second hand stores are a godsend. Especially if you can find a thrift store in a more well-to-do neighborhood. I regularly find brand name items for under $10 cad at thrift stores. Always in great shape, and sometimes even with tags still on!\n\nC) look for small details or embellishments that take an item of clothing from everyday to dressy. For example, instead of a plain t-shirt, look for one that has frills, beading, lacing, an asymmetrical cut, etc. you can wear the exact same material as your most comfy clothes, but if it's got little details it automatically looks more put together. \n\nD) have a set of neutral basics (again, focus on comfort as well as appearance). For example, most of my pants are a brand of activewear sold at Walmart for $30 or so. They are not only super comfortable, but they also have deep pockets on the front, and the black ones look a lot like dress slacks. I'd be very willing to wear them in any professional setting. Having basics in neutral colours will make it easy to mix and match. For example, you can wear almost any colour of shirt with black or grey pants. You can wear any colour of pants with a black, grey, or white top. This applies to skirts as well as pants, shorts, shirts, etc.\n\nE) to make mornings easier, group clothes by type. Ie, group your pants into a neutral group and a flamboyant (or coloured or whatever word works best for you) group. Group shirts by type first (short sleeve and long sleeve are easiest for me) then by neutral and flamboyant within those types. Then in the morning, instead of having to think about what goes with what, grab one neutral item and one non-neutral item. For example, a neutral pair of pants and a flamboyant shirt. Or the reverse. If one of your base pieces is neutral, you're not going to accidentally grab two items that clash. Takes a lot less forethought that way. ~~~ an alternative to grouping by type is how my sil organizes hers. She will have a pair of pants hung followed by three or so shirts that go well with that pair. Then another pair of pants and three or so shirts. And so on. This method takes more prep time when putting clothing away, but removes even more planning in the mornings. This can also be done by folding clothes together... Ie, stack of three shirts (say two short sleeve and one long) with a pair of pants on top. The reason for pairing several shirts with one pair of pants is that most people have far more tops than bottoms. \n\nF) thrift stores are often a great place to look for shoes, bags, and accessories as well. I tend to default to neutral for shoes and bags because it's easier and takes less thought/prep time. My sneakers are black slip-ons that have a top layer that looks like lace. This texture punches them up a notch, and again, makes it seem like I put more thought into what I wore than day than I actually did. Also, a pair or two of dressy boots with little to no heel can be a great addition. Again though, I buy the vast majority of this from thrift stores or clothing swaps. My favorite pair of boots cost me $7 cad at a thrift store. For accessories, I have a few basic pieces that I wear regularly... A neutral coloured necklace, and neutral watch. Then I can add a second necklace or earrings to punch it up a bit.\n\nG) for makeup, basic is best. Honestly, IF I do makeup, it's mascara and a lip stain. Even if the lip stain is in a neutral colour, it can make you look like you put a lot more effort in than you did. I don't use foundation or blush. On very rare occasions I use eye shadow. (The lip stain I use is by Revlon, and lasts for hours without needing to touch up)\n\nH) upgrade your wardrobe gradually. A couple shirts or a pair of pants or shoes per month will make a huge difference. Especially if you already have neutral basics. (Most people do. Those neutral basics can be jeans as well. Darker looks dressier). Don't try to revamp your entire clothing collection all at once. BUT as you bring new items in, get rid of old. If you don't have much of something (like only one or two pairs of pants) then obviously don't leave yourself short. But a general guideline of tossing/donating one item for every two you bring in is a great way to keep from getting swamped with too many clothes. Once you have roughly the amount of clothing you want, you can stay at a balance by donating/tossing one item for each item you bring in. \n\nI) a great way to determine if you have clothes you never wear is as follows: every six months take all the clothes you hang and put the hangers on the rack backwards. Once you've warn and washed an item and it's ready to be rehung, hang it the way you normally would. In six months look at the clothing still on backwards hangers. If it doesn't have sentimental value, it needs to leave your house. If it has sentimental value, put it in a bin or box to get it out of your closet. Then rehang everything you've decided to keep in the closet backwards again. Repeat every six months to a year. (Seasonally specific clothes don't need to be done every six months. Do those once per year instead). For clothes that get folded, when you hang clothes backwards, fold clothes inside out. Then when you've warn and washed, fold right side in and put away. After six months, if an item is still inside out, determine its sentimental value and treat accordingly. \n\nJ) and this is the absolutely most important part. Wear what you feel good in. Where the styles you like, that you feel look good on you. Doing so will really help boost your confidence, and a woman who is confident will always look more put together than a woman who is unsure of herself.", "Nta I agree. I have chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid sometimes I'm in pjs just cause it's all I can do.
