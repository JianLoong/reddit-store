Your mom is already providing you tons of support - letting you move back in, not paying rent, and I'm betting she pays all the utilities and likely even is buying you groceries. Paying for gas when you drive the car and half the insurance for a car you share, isn't really pitching in - it's paying for things you are using.\n\nInstead of being grateful, you demand she also watch your kid.  It's your kid and your responsibility to take care of it. Having a kid is overwhelming, but that's the price you pay for choosing to make one.

Your girlfriend doesn't work?! Why? She needs to get a job ASAP. You can apply for childcare assistance to help pay for daycare.

What\u2019s your GF doing all day?", "YTA.\n\nWhen a driver under age 25 is in the household, the cost of insurance more than doubles. So the half you are giving your mom most likely doesn't cover the increase. You're paying for the gas you use, which is nice, yet you say nothing about maintenance or repair which tells me your mom is stuck with it. When it comes to the car you are not paying your way.\n\nYour mother is struggling financially but all you think about is how much more you can get out of her. If your GF isn't working she should be caring for the kid, as should you. You should be helping your mom, not leeching, especially since she let you live there 3 months for free. Good for you if you're paying rent now, but you don't say anything about utilities or food. You may be unclear as to how much your mom is already helping you.", "YTA You absolutely are taking advantage of her. And it baffles me how your defense of not paying her the rent you owe her for the past three months is how you pay for gas that you use when you drive and how you pay half of the car insurance on the car that you share. I...WHAT?! How is this you defending yourself?! You pay half the insurance because you use the car, you pay for gas when you drive the car, that's the BARE MINIMUM not you doing her a favor. And it's her car, so she loses the money when the car loses value and has more repairs because you use it.\n\nSeriously, you're an adult and you chose to have a child. Your mother does not owe you anything. You owe her rent. And she sure as hell doesn't owe you free babysitting. Why doesn't your girlfriend work? If she's a stay at home parent then why do you need so much babysitting from your mother?

You are an adult. You are expecting an awful lot from your mother. It is not her responsibility to babysit, much less share her home and car with you.

Your mum works so how do you get so much snowflake entitlement to demand babysitting from your working mum while your babymom does not. Don't ask your mother for money - you bred a child so it's your responsibility to provide for that child. Get a second job if you have to or get babymom off her ass to work - even part-time to help.

However, your mother is not obligated to babysit for you. She is telling you that she feels that you are taking advantage of her. Your response should be to find things to do to make her feel like you're not taking advantage of her, not trying to convince her to babysit for free.\n\nI suggest you start applying for government assistance.

But between you and your girlfriend, you're two people with one job.

Why and how you're behind is of your own making (you damaged your previous digs), also of your own making is 'the baby', pretty sure Mum wasn't there at procreation and given the kid has 2 parents, why need her to babysit at all? You simply get your lives together and live up to your own *self-made* responsibilities.", "All your choices. You chose to damage your apartment. You chose not to pay rent. You chose to have a baby. You are an adult, you're mother doesn't have to bail you out, give you a place to live or let her use her car. You and your girlfriend need to stop complaining and get your act together. \n\nYour girlfriend needs to get a job. You need to find child care. You need to contact your creditors and get on a payment plan. You need a budget and you need to stick to it and bail yourselves out of the mess you two made.", "then don\u2019t PLAN to have a baby. it\u2019s not your mother\u2019s fault you\u2019re not smart", "Should have thought of that before you knocked up a teenager aye buddy. \n\n1 - sign up for budgeting classes. \n\n2 - Sign up for parenting classes\n\n3 - Girlfriend needs a job, ASAP\n\n4 - Enrol kid in daycare or work opposite hours to girlfriend. \n\n5 - stop bludging off your mum. \n\n6 - take responsibility for your own life choices! \n\nOh..  YTA if that wasn't clear.", "Why won\u2019t you answer the question about why you need a babysitter if gf doesn\u2019t work? It has been asked over and over.", "Why did you have a baby if you're struggling right now?", "Okay, but you also said this baby was PLANNED, so why did you not have savings? Why was there literally zero planning into this planned child?", "Why not move into your \u2018current\u2019 girlfriends parents house, they may give you free childcare, an allowance and do all your cooking and cleaning too.", "You know when your time to save was? The entire pregnancy. Or before you even tried to get pregnant.", "Did you think kids were cheap? What possessed you into thinking a planned child at that age was wise? Tbh I strongly recommend joining the military. A lot of people end up joining to avoid homelessness.", "u/Thediciplematt surely must have said N T A by mistake. Y T A would be more consistent with the rest of their comment.", "It isn\u2019t. BUT, parental support is 100% needed when you have a young family.\n\nMy MiL and SIL help a lot and I\u2019m grateful each time. Now, I\u2019m in a better financial spot so I find ways to pay them.\n\nIt sounds like grandma is more upset about how little he\u2019s contributing to the home and making her struggle more than time with the kid .", "I mean, sometimes you need help. We ask the MIL and SIL all the time and it is a hugeeee help.\n\nHim working and not paying for rent while his mom struggles? That\u2019s pretty bad.", "My question also. If you weren\u2019t living together, in a stable relationship and stable financial situation why would you plan a child?", "It's worse when you run the numbers knowing the kid is 6 months.\n\nLet's give them grace and say she's just about to turn 20. She was still, at the oldest, 18 & 10 months when she got pregnant. This timeline works with her potentially being 17 at the time if she got pregnant.", "Because it sounds like any job she could get would cost way more in child care?  They probably can\u2019t afford for her to work.", "That's what got them in trouble in the first place.... better not make it baby #2.", "being in school and employed is easy, most students can do it. being a student with a kid? not so much...", "Exactly??? I feel like I\u2019m on drugs reading this like there is no basic aspect of life either of these yahoos were prepared for with or without a baby", "I mean.. this is a direct correlation to his mother's parenting \ud83d\ude2c", "Planned baby with a teenager without even having his own car ffs. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah, after I thought about it some more it does seem like an YTA situation.", "Yo his mom works, let\u2019s him use her car, AND should help with his baby? She has every right to decline. Especially, and I\u2019ll put this in caps so you don\u2019t miss it, SINCE HIS GF DOES NOT WORK. \n\nHe has every right to ask his mom, but she has every right to decline. She didn\u2019t have that baby. She\u2019s not obligated to do shit.", "For sure, and if they want that\u2019s awesome. \n\nI know too many people like this though that\u2019ll use everyone around them and it always seems like 1 of the parents just magically don\u2019t want to work or watch the kid. It\u2019s irritating.", "Edit to add: you also refer to her as your \u201ccurrent\u201d girlfriend. This isn\u2019t even a stable enough relationship to call her your partner, spouse, fianc\u00e9. Anything else?", "What\u2019s more is, some 23 and 19 yr olds are so immature still at those ages that the mom possibly feels like she now lives with 3 kids. No wonder she\u2019s stressed.", "Agree to disagree.\n\nShe is going above and beyond and doesn\u2019t \u201chave to do\u201d anything.\n\nThe son needs to pay rent and start helping out. I imagine most of the problems will go away if he pays rent and works around the house.", "Are you still literally ignoring that his gf doesn\u2019t work. Jesus."]}
