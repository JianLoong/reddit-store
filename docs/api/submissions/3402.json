Your mom is already providing you tons of support - letting you move back in, not paying rent, and I'm betting she pays all the utilities and likely even is buying you groceries. Paying for gas when you drive the car and half the insurance for a car you share, isn't really pitching in - it's paying for things you are using.\n\nInstead of being grateful, you demand she also watch your kid.  It's your kid and your responsibility to take care of it. Having a kid is overwhelming, but that's the price you pay for choosing to make one.

Your girlfriend doesn't work?! Why? She needs to get a job ASAP. You can apply for childcare assistance to help pay for daycare.

What\u2019s your GF doing all day?", "YTA.\n\nWhen a driver under age 25 is in the household, the cost of insurance more than doubles. So the half you are giving your mom most likely doesn't cover the increase. You're paying for the gas you use, which is nice, yet you say nothing about maintenance or repair which tells me your mom is stuck with it. When it comes to the car you are not paying your way.\n\nYour mother is struggling financially but all you think about is how much more you can get out of her. If your GF isn't working she should be caring for the kid, as should you. You should be helping your mom, not leeching, especially since she let you live there 3 months for free. Good for you if you're paying rent now, but you don't say anything about utilities or food. You may be unclear as to how much your mom is already helping you.", "YTA You absolutely are taking advantage of her. And it baffles me how your defense of not paying her the rent you owe her for the past three months is how you pay for gas that you use when you drive and how you pay half of the car insurance on the car that you share. I...WHAT?! How is this you defending yourself?! You pay half the insurance because you use the car, you pay for gas when you drive the car, that's the BARE MINIMUM not you doing her a favor. And it's her car, so she loses the money when the car loses value and has more repairs because you use it.\n\nSeriously, you're an adult and you chose to have a child. Your mother does not owe you anything. You owe her rent. And she sure as hell doesn't owe you free babysitting. Why doesn't your girlfriend work? If she's a stay at home parent then why do you need so much babysitting from your mother? Are you just trying to get her to parent your kid?\n\nYou're about to be homeless/forced to stay at a shelter because of your entitlement issues.

You are an adult. You are expecting an awful lot from your mother. It is not her responsibility to babysit, much less share her home and car with you.

You need to catch her up on her rent, at the very least. Then you need to pay 2/3 of the bills. You don't need a babysitter if your gf isn't working.

Your mum works so how do you get so much snowflake entitlement to demand babysitting from your working mum while your babymom does not. Don't ask your mother for money - you bred a child so it's your responsibility to provide for that child. Get a second job if you have to or get babymom off her ass to work - even part-time to help.

However, your mother is not obligated to babysit for you. She is telling you that she feels that you are taking advantage of her. Your response should be to find things to do to make her feel like you're not taking advantage of her, not trying to convince her to babysit for free.\n\nI suggest you start applying for government assistance.

Your jobs need to alternate in schedule.  My sons dad worked 7am-5pm in ag jobs, I worked 7pm-2am as a server at a truck stop diner.  IT WAS HARD!  I\u2019m not going to lie.  But we were young and we made it work.  We lived with his parents at the time and we paid them rent of $200 at the time.  This was 30+ years ago so that was a lot back then.  \n\nWe also paid for food and helped with utilities.  We had a hand me down car his dad gave us which seemed to always have something wrong with it, so we foolishly got a newer car and then had a car payment plus insurance because we were both 19 so insurance was high for us.  But luckily his mom sat us down and taught us how to budget.  You have to prioritize the musts:  housing, food, utilities.  These are the first to be paid.  Then necessities like diapers.  Then move in to gas/auto, debt and then personal wants like entertainment and eating out.  If there\u2019s no money left for entertainment then you don\u2019t go out.\n\nWe did this for a little over 2 years, we saw each other on the weekends and were exhausted but managed to take care of our son and spend what time we could with him and each other as a family.  \n\nAfter the first year my sons dad got a job in construction so his income increased and we made a lot of progress and paid off all our debt and his parents \u201cupped\u201d our rent to $500 per month.  It was fine because we didn\u2019t have any other bills and they insisted we stay with them until we could buy a house instead of rent. I still kept my diner job and we were able to live off my sons dads income and save all mine.  \n\nEven though the schedule was rough, it was worth the struggle for those couple years. \n\nWhen we finally were able to buy our first house, his parents gave us all the money we had been paying them in rent over those years to use for our house and we were able to buy furniture and other needs for the home.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not going to be hard, but it\u2019s doable without having to pay for daycare.  If you two truly love each other and are willing to work hard for what you want, you can do it.", "Do you reeeeely have to ask?? YTA and so is your unemployed baby mama.

While I was lucky enough to stay rent-free, I was very conscious that they were not free babysitters. My stepmother would put him on the bed beside her while she blowdried her hair so I could have a shower (ten mins, max) and my dad would hold him while I ate my dinner (he always seemed to cry at dinner time so they'd eat and then I would). And that was pretty much it, apart from the odd night when I was losing my sh\\*t and my dad would rock him to sleep. I was expected to keep the house clean, do my own and baby's washing and help with cooking etc (I would've cooked more but my stepmother loves cooking and prefers to make her own meals).

They\u2019re \u201csharing\u201d moms car. So you had a child, couldn\u2019t afford rent, AND you have no transportation?\n\n3. The teenager with no life prospects right now has no family? I\u2019m guessing it has to do with moving in with a 22 year old at 18 and actively deciding to get knocked up? What, did you guys see what parenting was like on Instagram and decide you were ssoooo in love?\n\n4. You don\u2019t \u201cshare a household\u201d! You, sir, live with your mom in her spare bedroom with 2 other people.\n\n5. I\u2019m curious to know what your plan for childcare was since your child was planned? Did you think you were going to be able to pay for everything with your job and she\u2019d stay home?!

Rent (you pay your mom), car note (you don\u2019t have one), cellphones (aren\u2019t THAT expensive), utilities (sounds like all of those are covered by mom), maybe (and I say maybe generously) there are hospital bills related to the birth of your son which fine and very expensive in the US but generally if you tell them you have no health insurance and can\u2019t pay, Typically I see this bill drop significantly AND you can setup a payment plan. Then you mentioned Health insurance for your son which, ok, maybe the only legit bill. But you\u2019re taking home like $3k a month, do I agree with mom. What the hell are you spending your money on?! What kinda \u201cbills\u201d are behind / stacking up?\n\n8. Why is your mom already babysitting when gf is home all day with no job? I\u2019m sorry but there are no \u201cbreaks\u201d. Parents don\u2019t have to be so grateful for a grandchild that they become nannies.\n\n9. You are a burden.
