You judge him for something that does NOT affect you or your family in any way shape or form. YTA and you and your family need to get over yall selfs.", "That mental image made me crack up! :P", ">he's not making you stand there and clap\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Thanks for that mental image, that will pop into my mind and make me giggle all day \ud83d\ude4f", "I really thought OP was going to say he didn't want to invite all three of his brother's partners. ....But he's not even inviting his brother, and threatening to have him escorted out if he shows up?\n\nAnd I'm not poly, nor do I understand the appeal of it, but they're all consenting adults in a poly relationship. No cheating is involved, so why does OP constantly need to keep talking about how they don't believe in cheating when he discusses his brother and his relationship(s)? So bizarre.\n\nOP is an insufferable, judgmental asshole. His brother is much better off without him in his life after this stunt.", "Yep. Just seems like a more hypocritical family than average.", "Ngl, this post just screams \u201cI suck in bed\u201d or, alternatively, \u201cI suppress my sexual desires and so I am jealous of my brother\u201d. \n\nThe brother sounds dope af and the family sound horrid:\u2019D", "Send him a \u201c+1\u201d invite.  He can choose which of his current squeezes gets to turn up.", "Not a +5?", "It's quite weird to know that much about a child/siblings sex life surely? \n\nI don't know what my brother's relationships are like and vice versa, same with my parents.\n\nOP and his parents seem strangely invested in each others relationships.", "The brother sounds fun AF! He was a physiotherapist so I assume he\u2019s intelligent! He maintains multiple partnerships with consenting adults, so he must be a good communicator, honest and great in the sack! Bartender, stripper and sex worker too?! He must be in decent shape and hot! \n\nOP\u2026well\u2026he sounds like a wet blanket. \u201c\u2026we learned how to resolve conflict and communicate well\u2026\u201d uh\u2026.no, no you didn\u2019t! And I call complete bullshit on everyone is friends with their exes. Bffr man! \n\nI find it hard to believe with a guest list of 600 that everyone attending is a prudish saint. YTA", ">Info: Does he have a history of putting on live, unrequested, poly sex shows at people's parties/life events?\n\nHahahahahaha omg", "I have to correct you, not because I am bothered that you are wrong but because to me it is so ridiculous: it is not a four day wedding, it is a five (!) day wedding \ud83d\ude02", "With 600+ guests that OP knows for a fact has never cheated, had one night stands, orgyes or anything other than monogamous, vanilla sex! I wonder if he send out a questionnaire before sending the invites...", "Someone could for sake of family. Bring them there as happened by several ops here because of fammily\nOr force them to reconsile", "What do u mean by disgusting details? \ud83e\udee3", ">so why does OP constantly need to keep talking about how they don't believe in cheating when he discusses his brother and his relationship(s)?\n\nBecause OP has no idea what love actually is. He's so brainwashed by his parents, he equates love to one person at a time only and can't comprehend loving someone else at the same time. Thus his brother must be cheating.", "I mean youre doing to exact same thing OP is doing, which makes you a hypocrite. If its fine for you to call them \"sucky in bed\" for holding sex to a different standard than you then you cant really call OP an asshole for being judmental of their brother for the same reason, because that makes you an asshole as well.", "Christ! Totally misread that. How self absorbed do you need to be to want to have a 5 day celebration?!", "Right!?", "His brother actions are not disgusting, what i meant is that can be disgusting to picture the sex life of family members. Example: my father has a foot fetish and was way happier without knowing it.", "I said suck in bed because they specifically mentioned casual sex\ud83e\udd28 That has nothing to do with assumptions but with the slang term christian sex or casual sex being used to describe people who are bad at bed lol. \n\nI mean, I am an asshole by all accounts, but not when I make a joke due to poor choice of words in the hands of OP:\u2019D", "Tbf it\u2019s a pretty big deal to move out of the apparently monogamous relationship he was in with his whole family.", "Lots of people are not into casual sex and also arent judgemental of people who are. Does that makeall of them them sucky in bed? I dont understand why using the phrase \"casual sex\" makes it okay for you to behave in the same manner you judge as assholish but okay, you do you."]}
