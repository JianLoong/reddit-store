Sorry to tell you bro but thats probably not true CD\nMost people hide it if they cheat and dont talk about it at all.

I\u2019m quite certain he\u2019s happy to spend as little time with you as possible.

You are saying that it is not ok for him to not fully accept whatever his brother does. Does not matter if it impacts him at all, he may simply disagree with it and does not want to associate with people that do. You passed judgment in your first sentence. Just because someone disagrees or does not want to associate with certain people does not make them bigots or phobic, no matter how much the screaming idiots try to push that bullshit. It is his right to disagree just as it is your right to agree and some other persons right to not give a single fuck about it either way. Too many of you think if people do not believe exactly as the progressive agenda dictates then they are bigots or phobics. I think it truly upsets a lot of groups if people just flat do not give a fuck about them or even acknowledge them. That makes it hilarious, like little kids stomping their feet screaming \"acknowledge me!!!\", and it just drives them crazy to find out 99.9% of the people in the world truly do not give a flying fuck about them. That includes you and me, the majority of people we meet, in the long run just do not care about you. If you're lucky you may have parents, siblings, and maybe a few friends that care, but the majority does not give a fuck about you, your opinions, your thoughts, hopes, or dreams.
