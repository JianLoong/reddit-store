People might enter fewer relationships with bounds that they can stick to. People who have got manipulated into a shitty situation might be able to get help more easily because they don't need to worry about people first telling them off for their mode of relationship.

Let\u2019s not act like just because YOU don\u2019t agree with someone\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t their right to make that decision. That\u2019s like not inviting someone because they are anti-Semitic and you don\u2019t approve of Nazis even though you yourself aren\u2019t Jewish. It has no bearing on you and no impact on your life personally, but you\u2019re still allowed to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t behavior or choices I am okay or comfortable being around\u201d. It\u2019s really easy to agree that the people getting married have that right when it\u2019s something you can clearly agree is wrong, isn\u2019t it? But that\u2019s the thing, *Everyone* has the right to make that choice, and yes, even people with views you don\u2019t agree with. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s definitely important to recognize that he won\u2019t have a relationship with his brother, and much like OP can post about this on the internet, so can his brother, especially when he SENT A FREAKING LETTER!! and OP needs to accept that. However, for anyone saying \u201che\u2019ll lose his brother with this behavior\u201d, honestly, do you actually think he cares?

Because it\u2019s the same exact thing, that pertains to their sex life and doesn\u2019t actually affect OP, but I can guarantee you everyone on here would say OP is NTA for not inviting the brother then. The reality is, people are ALLOWED to choose not to be around people who have different morals than them, even if YOU don\u2019t agree with those morals. And yes, people are ALLOWED (and I would fully argue SHOULD) choose to uphold their values even if they don\u2019t directly affect them. Like, why do you actually want that to be the standard? Because that\u2019s like saying as a white person you\u2019re an asshole for uninviting someone racists against whomever because well, you\u2019re white so it doesn\u2019t even affect you? But, the fuck? Of COURSE you should stand up for your values of not being racist. And in fact, if it WERE race being the issue here, everyone would be saying you NEED to stand up for your morals even if it doesn\u2019t affect you, otherwise you\u2019re being hypocritical. \n\nYou can have different morals and views to OP about sexual freedom and still recognize that OP is allowed to have that view and not want to be around someone who acts like his brother just because they happen to share blood.", "OP really just nuked his relationship with his brother from orbit\n\nAnd from OPs horrendously judgemental tone, I am betting he won't care if brother goes NC.\n\nI feel really sorry for the nrother.

Not one rude, uppity, condescending, or even slightly mean person on sight. They were all very kind, even to us, the \"help.\" I was touched, and still feel so privileged to have been a part of their special day.", "I have interacted with 100s of \"monogamous\" people.\n\nOr at least people who told their partner they were being monogamous.", "a lot of monogamous people are liars too and are not honest and transparent about what's going on even in their sex lives. Look at the number of monogamous people who admit to cheating. \n\ni'm not saying two wrongs make a right. just that people are people whether poly or mono there are people who are dishonest with their partners about sex, finances, and loads of other stuff. \n\nit isn't just (or primarily) a poly problem. \n\ni've interacted with thousands of monogamous couples and also found less than half are being honest, transparent, and open with each other. you know?", "Dr. Phil personally screened all of them.", "My ex was \"poly\" and he was only poly for himself and I was supposed to be completely and totally monogamous.  Basically, he wanted to date and have sex with everyone around him, but if I even looked at another guy he had a melt down.  When I offered him a chance to open our relationship, he decided that he was suddenly monogamous while trying to get my best friend to sleep with him.  There are terrible poly people, but if you're not open and honest than yeah it's cheating.", "Using it to spice things up may be non-monogamous, but its not polyamory. \n\nJust like saying not all rectangles are squares. PolyAm has a specific meaning, and involves relationships, not just sex.", "People I've known in open relationships don't identify as \"poly\", but yeah it's often pretty crappy too. I think it's one thing to keep a relationship open when you're in the early stages, but when it's a long term thing, it again raises the issue of whether it's really a mutual decision. Like I knew one couple who were \"open\", but she said she had no desire to be with anyone else. He wanted to fuck other women openly, and she compromised."]}
