People might enter fewer relationships with bounds that they can stick to. People who have got manipulated into a shitty situation might be able to get help more easily because they don't need to worry about people first telling them off for their mode of relationship. Sexual health and education could be strengthened. \n\nYou could easily say \"my family strongly believe in heterosexuality, everyone has been in straight relationships and they think sex should be between a man and a woman\" about so many families, that doesn't mean it's okay for them to be homophobic and you know that full well. \n\nAside from all of that... just get off your high horse!

I'm pretty sure that's what the commenter you were responding to was getting at.\n\nYou're right though that everyone is entitled to go \"nah, not my cup of tea,\" but disinviting his own brother from his wedding as an (obvious) attempt at social punishment for not living how OP thinks he should, definitely makes this a YTA judgment.", "Responsible poly people are freaking amazing.
