I was very much treated as \u201cthe baby of the family\u201d and still am kind of. Not to any extreme, it\u2019s more of a joking thing. My dad curses like a trucker and my brother will teasingly say \u201cdad, not in front of the baby\u201d. It\u2019s all in good fun, they\u2019ve never tried to prevent me from growing up or anything. We\u2019re a really close family and hang out a lot. \n\nI do have a family nickname (a shortened form of my name. Think \u201cJonny\u201d for John, though that\u2019s not it) that I kind of grew tired of in my teens. I never told them that, though, as it\u2019s harmless and it doesn\u2019t bother me that much. Like I said, they didn\u2019t know I didn\u2019t like it and I know if I had told them, they\u2019d stop immediately.\n\nI\u2019ve been dating \u201cAshley\u201d for a few months now. When she met my family, they called me by that nickname. She used it after we left and I playfully rolled my eyes, saying \u201cI hate that name\u201d. She was confused and asked why they called me that then. I said I never made a big deal of it and it really doesn\u2019t matter. I just prefer that outside my parents and siblings, others don\u2019t use it. I also asked that she not say anything to them. She said okay.\n\nWe got together last weekend for my mom\u2019s birthday. At one point, my sister asked something along the lines of \u201cJonny, do you want a soda?\u201d Ashley went to help her. I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nAfter the party, my mom called and asked \u201cSo\u2026how long have you hated that we call you Jonny?\u201d My stomach dropped. I asked why she would assume that and she said Ashley told my sister she should stop calling me that as I hated it. My sister waited until the party ended to say anything as she didn\u2019t want to cause drama. She told our parents so they would know not to call me that anymore.\n\nI told my mom it was okay. It\u2019s not that I truly mind. She said if I told them sooner, they would\u2019ve stopped. I said seriously, don\u2019t worry about it. She asked if I was sure a few times. I could tell she felt really guilty and that made me sad.\n\nI called Ashley after and asked why the hell she would say that. She said she was just trying to help out. I said she had no business saying anything. She\u2019s told me secrets and I\u2019d never dream of repeating them. She kept saying I was overreacting and I should thank her. I told her she caused a bunch of drama over nothing. She told me I was ungrateful. I hung up the phone. She\u2019s texted me a few times since and I haven\u2019t responded. Basically her gist is I shouldn\u2019t have told her if I didn\u2019t want her to say anything.

Here\u2019s why.  It\u2019s not about the name at all.  You told her something and asked her not to say anything.  She said okay and then turned around and did it anyway.  That the nickname thing is a relatively minor thing is not the point.  You had decided it wasn\u2019t something you wanted to make an issue out of. She took that decision away from you. And, yes, she caused unnecessary hurt with your family that you didn\u2019t want caused.\n\nShe\u2019s demonstrated that she\u2019ll ignore your wishes if she decides to be \u201chelpful\u201d about something else.

And you\u2019re just talking to get a handle on how you feel and what you want to do?  She sounds like a fixer\u2026and since she expects you to be grateful she \u201cfixed\u201d a problem you didn\u2019t actually have, this will be your life with her.  Only you can decide if you\u2019re ok with either never sharing confidences with your girlfriend or accepting that she\u2019s going to pretty much smash past boundaries if she decides it\u2019s for the best.", "NTA\n\nMy name is Rebecca.

You told her not to say anything and she ignored you and went against your wishes. Red flag. \n\nI have pretty much the exact same dynamic with my family, I'm also the youngest with a nickname that only they use and I'm not a huge fan of. But I don't mind them using it since they're family and it does remind me of our unique bond, even though I absolutely hate anyone else using it since they haven't known me since I was a kid like my family has.\n\nAll of that said, I do think you overreacted *a bit* with the \"causing drama in my family\" accusation. Did this really cause *drama*? Doesn't sound like it's a big deal for your family.

He wants to be John.

They have been told that\u2019s my legal name and the name I use socially and professionally now with most people, but I don\u2019t expect them to switch.\n\nJohn did not expect them to switch, even though it was probably quite clear over the years that he went by John with new people in his life.", "The point is he didn't feel strongly enough.
