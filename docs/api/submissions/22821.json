I was very much treated as \u201cthe baby of the family\u201d and still am kind of. Not to any extreme, it\u2019s more of a joking thing. My dad curses like a trucker and my brother will teasingly say \u201cdad, not in front of the baby\u201d. It\u2019s all in good fun, they\u2019ve never tried to prevent me from growing up or anything. We\u2019re a really close family and hang out a lot. \n\nI do have a family nickname (a shortened form of my name. Think \u201cJonny\u201d for John, though that\u2019s not it) that I kind of grew tired of in my teens. I never told them that, though, as it\u2019s harmless and it doesn\u2019t bother me that much. Like I said, they didn\u2019t know I didn\u2019t like it and I know if I had told them, they\u2019d stop immediately.\n\nI\u2019ve been dating \u201cAshley\u201d for a few months now. When she met my family, they called me by that nickname. She used it after we left and I playfully rolled my eyes, saying \u201cI hate that name\u201d. She was confused and asked why they called me that then. I said I never made a big deal of it and it really doesn\u2019t matter. I just prefer that outside my parents and siblings, others don\u2019t use it. I also asked that she not say anything to them. She said okay.\n\nWe got together last weekend for my mom\u2019s birthday. At one point, my sister asked something along the lines of \u201cJonny, do you want a soda?\u201d Ashley went to help her. I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nAfter the party, my mom called and asked \u201cSo\u2026how long have you hated that we call you Jonny?\u201d My stomach dropped. I asked why she would assume that and she said Ashley told my sister she should stop calling me that as I hated it. My sister waited until the party ended to say anything as she didn\u2019t want to cause drama. She told our parents so they would know not to call me that anymore.\n\nI told my mom it was okay. It\u2019s not that I truly mind. She said if I told them sooner, they would\u2019ve stopped. I said seriously, don\u2019t worry about it. She asked if I was sure a few times. I could tell she felt really guilty and that made me sad.\n\nI called Ashley after and asked why the hell she would say that. She said she was just trying to help out. I said she had no business saying anything. She\u2019s told me secrets and I\u2019d never dream of repeating them. She kept saying I was overreacting and I should thank her. I told her she caused a bunch of drama over nothing. She told me I was ungrateful. I hung up the phone. She\u2019s texted me a few times since and I haven\u2019t responded. Basically her gist is I shouldn\u2019t have told her if I didn\u2019t want her to say anything.  My point is she never said she couldn\u2019t keep a secret and she knew I wanted it to stay secret.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689960444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155uf0n/aita_for_expecting_my_girlfriend_wouldnt_spill_a/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here\u2019s why.  It\u2019s not about the name at all.  You told her something and asked her not to say anything.  She said okay and then turned around and did it anyway.  That the nickname thing is a relatively minor thing is not the point.  You had decided it wasn\u2019t something you wanted to make an issue out of. She took that decision away from you. And, yes, she caused unnecessary hurt with your family that you didn\u2019t want caused.\n\nShe\u2019s demonstrated that she\u2019ll ignore your wishes if she decides to be \u201chelpful\u201d about something else.  Can she really be trusted to keep your confidences?  What if the next time it\u2019s something you\u2019re not ready yet to discuss with the other person(s)?  And you\u2019re just talking to get a handle on how you feel and what you want to do?  She sounds like a fixer\u2026and since she expects you to be grateful she \u201cfixed\u201d a problem you didn\u2019t actually have, this will be your life with her.  Only you can decide if you\u2019re ok with either never sharing confidences with your girlfriend or accepting that she\u2019s going to pretty much smash past boundaries if she decides it\u2019s for the best.", "NTA\n\nMy name is Rebecca. I introduce myself as Rebecca. My family calls me Becca. Only my family uses that name. 2 people in my life have been allowed to call me Becky. I don't answer to that name except to those 2, very special people, because it is like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nIt is your name, and your choice who uses what diminutive. Things that family can do, others can't.  Your gf doesn't understand that while it is fine that your mom calls you Jonny, it would feel gross if a gf did it. It is a family name.", "NTA.\n\nShe agreed to keep something confidential and then failed to keep her word.  For me that would be a huge deal and depending on what it was she blabbed about it might be a dealbreaker.", "NTA\n\nYou asked her to not say anything to your family, and behind your back she did.   \nIt was not her place to decide what should and shouldnt be kept from your family, it wasnt her decision to make. You've only been dating a few months.", "NTA...you gf is a jerk and it's a good thing you're finding out early on in the relationship.  Take time to think if she's someone you want to be with.", "NTA - you told her not to say anything. Instead, she assumed she knew better and went behind your back.", "NTA You asked her not to say anything and she deliberately went behind your back and told them.

It's weird your girlfriend has only been around for a few months and has already caused drama within your family", "NTA ,but Ashley is", "She expects you to be grateful for doing something you specifically asked her not to do.

However, you trusted your girlfriend and she went behind your back and told it. Then expected you to be thankful for betraying your trust. This a small scale secret, what happens if there was a bigger one? \n\nHonestly, Ashley needs a reality check", "NTA she didn\u2019t need to say anything. It\u2019s understandable that you would allow your immediate family to continue using your nickname but wouldn\u2019t want others to use it", "You DID tell her not to say anything to them though. And she blatantly disrespected that, probably bc she wanted to have a one up on them and you\u2019re closeness. She caused that drama on purpose. \n\nYou said only family can call you that, even if you don\u2019t like it. She heard that and still did what she did.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and her reaction is what makes her TA. Maybe she actually didn't understand at first that you wanted to keep it secret, but then she should have apologized when you made that clear. She was overstepping a boundary, no matter her intentions. If she doesn't come around soon, i would seriously reconsider the relationship.", "Nta\u2026.she sounds like a pot stirrer imo. She\u2019s messing with your family dynamic and that\u2019s a huge red flag. If you got tired of being called that name. Than you can decide when to say something. \n\nFor the record my son is the same, I\u2019ll call him \u201cjohnny\u201d (we\u2019ll stick with this name as the example)as his nick name as he got older I noticed the people he brings around calls him \u201cjohn\u201d so I try to call him \u201cJohn\u201d out in public places with his friends around to be respectful that he\u2019s a grown man now. but he\u2019s always my little johnny lol and he doesn\u2019t say anything to me when I say Johnny.", "NTA you specifically asked her not to say anything and said that inside your family you do not mind it as much.", "NTA\n\nBut Ashley is. Drop her -- you can't trust her. She didn't just betray your trust, she attacked YOU for being upset that she betrayed it.", "NTA -\n\nThis is about violating a confidence.  This is about breaking your word.  This is about trust.\n\nAshely said she wouldn't say anything.   Then she turned right around and shot her mouth off.   And then she went full-on DARVO by saying OP should be grateful.\n\nGrateful he found out what a self-serving,  dishonest witch Ashely is, I suppose.", "Nta\nBreak up with her, if she can't keep that secret, imagine in the future\nAnd be petty", "NTA. You told her not to say anything and she ignored you and went against your wishes. Red flag. \n\nI have pretty much the exact same dynamic with my family, I'm also the youngest with a nickname that only they use and I'm not a huge fan of. But I don't mind them using it since they're family and it does remind me of our unique bond, even though I absolutely hate anyone else using it since they haven't known me since I was a kid like my family has.\n\nAll of that said, I do think you overreacted *a bit* with the \"causing drama in my family\" accusation. Did this really cause *drama*? Doesn't sound like it's a big deal for your family. Though, her breaking your trust like that and telling people things you said that you didn't want repeated could definitely cause drama in the future. So it's still a huge red flag that she did that IMO.", "NTA.\n\nI'm the same,   If anyone besides my immediate family calls me by my non shortened name, I correct it.   But with my family I don't mind.  It's low key comforting hearing it from my from them, although hearing anyone else call me that name feels like nails on a chalkboard. BUT SFTU if you're not in that small group of ppl and refer to me by my full name. lmao\n\nHer reaction sucks, and I personally wouldn't have any faith that things said in private won't be immediately broadcasted.", "My boy , dump her and run, You don\u2019t know what else of yours she will be going around with telling people .and then acting offended and hurt cause she was trying to help,when you ask someone you are in a relationship with as simply as (don\u2019t tell anyone) They shouldn\u2019t and that\u2019s it .", "Honestly it sounds like this isn't really that big of a deal. Plenty of people have nicknames that they \"grow out of\" but they are perfectly fine with certain people using said name.

He wants to be John.  He made it clear.\n\nDespite the fact that he is okay with being Jonny to his family, she went to them and said he wasn\u2019t.\n\nBasically she turned a situation in which she was the outsider (you can\u2019t use this name) into a situation in which she pretended to be the insider (I know a secret you don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s that he hates when you call him Jonny.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s TA.

I introduced myself as Yehudit, I go by Yehudit or Didi.\n\nMy family has never been told I expect them to call me Yehudit or Didi.  They have been told that\u2019s my legal name and the name I use socially and professionally now with most people, but I don\u2019t expect them to switch.\n\nJohn did not expect them to switch, even though it was probably quite clear over the years that he went by John with new people in his life.", "The point is he didn't feel strongly enough.
