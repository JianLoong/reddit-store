I was very much treated as \u201cthe baby of the family\u201d and still am kind of. Not to any extreme, it\u2019s more of a joking thing. My dad curses like a trucker and my brother will teasingly say \u201cdad, not in front of the baby\u201d. It\u2019s all in good fun, they\u2019ve never tried to prevent me from growing up or anything. We\u2019re a really close family and hang out a lot. \n\nI do have a family nickname (a shortened form of my name. Think \u201cJonny\u201d for John, though that\u2019s not it) that I kind of grew tired of in my teens. I never told them that, though, as it\u2019s harmless and it doesn\u2019t bother me that much. Like I said, they didn\u2019t know I didn\u2019t like it and I know if I had told them, they\u2019d stop immediately.\n\nI\u2019ve been dating \u201cAshley\u201d for a few months now. When she met my family, they called me by that nickname. She used it after we left and I playfully rolled my eyes, saying \u201cI hate that name\u201d. She was confused and asked why they called me that then. I said I never made a big deal of it and it really doesn\u2019t matter. I just prefer that outside my parents and siblings, others don\u2019t use it. I also asked that she not say anything to them. She said okay.\n\nWe got together last weekend for my mom\u2019s birthday. At one point, my sister asked something along the lines of \u201cJonny, do you want a soda?\u201d Ashley went to help her. I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nAfter the party, my mom called and asked \u201cSo\u2026how long have you hated that we call you Jonny?\u201d My stomach dropped. I asked why she would assume that and she said Ashley told my sister she should stop calling me that as I hated it. My sister waited until the party ended to say anything as she didn\u2019t want to cause drama. She told our parents so they would know not to call me that anymore.\n\nI told my mom it was okay. It\u2019s not that I truly mind. She said if I told them sooner, they would\u2019ve stopped. I said seriously, don\u2019t worry about it. She asked if I was sure a few times. I could tell she felt really guilty and that made me sad.\n\nI called Ashley after and asked why the hell she would say that. She said she was just trying to help out. I said she had no business saying anything. She\u2019s told me secrets and I\u2019d never dream of repeating them. She kept saying I was overreacting and I should thank her. I told her she caused a bunch of drama over nothing. She told me I was ungrateful. I hung up the phone. She\u2019s texted me a few times since and I haven\u2019t responded. Basically her gist is I shouldn\u2019t have told her if I didn\u2019t want her to say anything.

Here\u2019s why.  It\u2019s not about the name at all.  You told her something and asked her not to say anything.  She said okay and then turned around and did it anyway.  That the nickname thing is a relatively minor thing is not the point.  You had decided it wasn\u2019t something you wanted to make an issue out of. She took that decision away from you.

And you\u2019re just talking to get a handle on how you feel and what you want to do?  She sounds like a fixer\u2026and since she expects you to be grateful she \u201cfixed\u201d a problem you didn\u2019t actually have, this will be your life with her.  Only you can decide if you\u2019re ok with either never sharing confidences with your girlfriend or accepting that she\u2019s going to pretty much smash past boundaries if she decides it\u2019s for the best.", "NTA\n\nMy name is Rebecca.

You told her not to say anything and she ignored you and went against your wishes. Red flag. \n\nI have pretty much the exact same dynamic with my family, I'm also the youngest with a nickname that only they use and I'm not a huge fan of. But I don't mind them using it since they're family and it does remind me of our unique bond, even though I absolutely hate anyone else using it since they haven't known me since I was a kid like my family has.\n\nAll of that said, I do think you overreacted *a bit* with the \"causing drama in my family\" accusation. Did this really cause *drama*? Doesn't sound like it's a big deal for your family.

But we outgrow them or they don't match how we want others to see us.", "If you can't trust your lady with something this basic .... dude your relationship is in major trouble! What's next? Texting your mates on the sly.. taking money from the coin jar.. borrowing your car and returning it damaged? Genuinely watch out for escalating behaviour followed by these kinds of gaslighting behaviours cause they are major red flags", "OP, if she had felt terrible and apologized ... that would be one thing.  But she wants YOU to be grateful, YOU are over-reacting .... YOU are the problem.\n\nThis will be for as long as you are together.  If you are ok always being in the wrong, for things that are both important and unimportant ... then stay with her.  \n\nLife is long ... you need someone who can keep confidences, own their shit, apologize when wrong.", "You now know she can\u2019t keep a confidence. So you move forward and don\u2019t tell her secrets or if it\u2019s important to you find someone to be with that can. I love my Mom but if you want the world to know something just tell her a secret. NTA", "I absolutely agree with all of this. Plus something that is really bothering me is that she has\n\nAbsolutely\nNo\nRemorses.\n\nShe is literally saying \"you should be thankful\" and that is the biggest red flag for me. Let's say she honestly believed she was making something good, but just goofed. (That's is a big stretch I know but let's imagine it.) She should have been very sorry, sad and apologized to hell and back. OP seems like a nice dude, he would have been mad but at least it would have been water under the bridge after a while, she would have apologized to everyone and it would have been a funny anecdote in 10 years. But no, she is certain of her good deed, and that is what is horrifying to me. \n\nShe is not a keeper OP, she seems like she wants control and is not open to any work on herself. I would suggest you to run.", "This here. OP is NTA, but the name thing isn\u2019t really the issue. \n\nOP, you could avoid this in the future by saying you don\u2019t like to use that name outside your family (assuming that\u2019s how you actually feel).", "This right here.", "I would say he has a good spine since he had enough confidence to say what he wants and not back down when pressed on it", "Because outside his family he doesn\u2019t want anyone else calling him that name?", "Right. I did this once--do something I was explicitly asked not to do. But I did it with the understanding that it could (and did) ruin the relationship. I still don't regret it. \n\nA friend told me she was crying and couldn't make herself leave her room. This was after months of built up signs of a mental health crisis. I asked if she wanted me to tell someone, like her mother, and she told me no. I thought about it for a while, and decided my friend was in trouble and needed help. Help I couldn't give her (as this was an online friend and she lived in a different country). I found her mom online and reached out.\n\nLast I heard the friend is doing great. If this is because of or despite me, I don't know.", "My BIL goes by a variation of his middle name. My entire family calls him that name. To my knowledge, he has no issue being called his nickname by people who aren't his family, but I know that he usually goes by his first name outside of us, so I'm not entirely sure. when I'm talking to people who call him by his real name, I use his real name. 1) to avoid confusion and 2) because I imagine that there is a reason that he goes by his first name to other people. He's never even asked me to do that, I just did it without question. \n\nI don't really understand what's so hard about not using the name and also not kicking up an unnecessary fuss when OP makes it clear that it doesn't bother him too much when his family uses the name.", "Excellent definition, I agree with you.", "There are levels to drama, I agree.  \n\nBut if someone goes behind my back to tell my momma something I specifically asked them not to?  And my momma calls me, hurt that I wasn\u2019t the one to mention it?  Yeah, that\u2019s drama to me.  My momma got her feelings hurt for no good damn reason all because someone decided to fix something I told them didn\u2019t need fixing.  \n\nThis time, the girlfriend caused some minor drama.  Next time, it\u2019s likely to be much worse.", "My take wasn\u2019t that he hated the name his family used\u2026\u201dI grew tired of it\u2026never told them\u2026as it\u2019s harmless and it doesn\u2019t bother me that much\u2026\u201d it was that he didn\u2019t like people other than those with the history using it\u2026\u201dI playfully rolled my eyes, saying \u201cI hate that name.\u201d\u201d  At some point in the future, he might very well have accepted it from the girlfriend.  But this may very well been his way of setting an \u201cit\u2019s too early in our relationship\u201d boundary while at the same time trying to not hurt her feelings.  Which wasn\u2019t an unreasonable way to address it.  We all stretch things a bit sometimes in order to not hurt someone\u2019s feelings.", "That could be fair to me but it\u2019s not straightforward for his girlfriend. Hence why I call it confusing", "Fair enough.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that GF hadn\u2019t earned the right at that point, it\u2019s that nickname made him feel like a little kid and that\u2019s tolerable and even a little sweet for family, but not ideal for GF. Otherwise, I agree."]}
