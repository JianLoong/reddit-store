My uncle was instrumental in my upbringing; he looked after me 3 evenings a week for ~10 years old, encouraged the hobby which eventually became my career, and was all around a wonderful man. \n\nI felt I had to go to the funeral. It pained me to travel 1000 miles so soon after my child was born, but I talked it through with my wife and we agreed a plan. I flew out the evening before the funeral, and left the evening afterwards. I slept in a hotel that night but woke early and got back by 8am that day. \n\nNot wanting to leave my wife unattended, my SIL (who lives about an hour away from us) agreed to take 3 days off from her job and come to help out in the house. \n\nAs soon as she arrived, she was amazing. She spent time with both of us asking our preferences when it comes to baby care (changing, playtime, nutrition, etc). She then pulled me aside to ask things like where we kept our various cleaning supplies, if my wife has any strong preferences/aversions to cleaning practices, what food we had on hand and what she could go and pick up, etc. \n\nI was amazed at her generosity, especially in the haze of a newborn and grief. \n\nThe funeral happened and I made it back as planned, but SIL had the rest of the day off and chose to spend it helping out further, allowing my wife to rest and me to wallow a bit. \n\nAll said and done, I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to my SIL. I obviously expressed it in words, but wanted to get her a gift to express my gratitude further. \n\nSIL LOVES the Tiffany brand, so I found a bracelet I knew she didn\u2019t have and might like, and asked my wife what she thought. \n\nTo be clear, I would have paid for this myself, and we\u2019re lucky enough to be able to afford this comfortably. I also buy my wife jewellery fairly regularly - mostly from smaller brands, as that is her explicit preference. She has said multiple times how she doesn\u2019t want \u2018big name\u2019 jewellery, even if money was no object. We\u2019ve explicitly mentioned Tiffany in these discussions. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e wasn\u2019t happy, to say the least. She pointed out that I\u2019d never bought her Tiffany jewellery (though as above, we\u2019ve discussed how she\u2019d never want any), and that it was a lot of money for \u2018a bit of household help\u2019.\n\nI made my point that SIL\u2019s help let me go to an important funeral I otherwise would have missed, provided great assistance for a few days, and that we were lucky enough to easily afford this treat as a token of gratitude. \n\nI asked both sides candidly if there were any issues whilst I was away, but neither said that there were. \n\nI\u2019m at a loss; I obviously won\u2019t upset my wife, but feel strongly that I\u2019d like to treat SIL for her help. WIBTA if I got her the bracelet? Cash or some other token gift don\u2019t seem quite worthwhile to me.", "created_utc": 1675697186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v9bup/wibta_for_treating_my_sil_after_she_helped_us_out/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if you go against what she wants, then you\u2019ll be TA. Relationships are a delicate balance of give and take. This isn\u2019t a situation to go all in on, and look for a clear winner.

Sounds like your wife may need a little pick me up gift too though and maybe feeling a little underappreciated and over emotional.", "NTA but a token of appreciation has to be given in relation to the amount she sacrificed in helping you. A token of appreciation would be a gift card to her favorite restaurant, coffee shop or a thank you card with some money in it. But solely it has to solely be from you not from your wife because she sacrificed too while you were gone. If you have never purchased that type of gift for your wife then you shouldn\u2019t spend it on someone else.", "YWBTA - I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with your gift idea, but it is clearly upsetting to your wife for some reason and I think her feelings needs to take priority in this situation. This is your wife's sister so I think she should get the final say. You would be the AH if you went ahead with this given your wife's clearly stated opinion on it. \n\nDid you get your wife a \"push present\"? If not, was she expecting one? If yes, did it cost more or less than what you were suggesting for her sister?\n\nHow is your wife doing generally? Is she feeling overwhelmed?
