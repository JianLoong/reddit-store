He didn't get a reaction out of me since I was fine with the breakup and have been wanting to break up for a while now.\n\ntwo days later, on Wednesday night, a classmate who I would occasionally say hi to while I was still dating my ex, had messaged me. He asked me if I had a BF and I said \"no\". We began texting back and forth and starting hanging out during and outside of school. He then told me that he found me attractive the first time he saw me but didn't make a move since he didn't know if I was dating someone or not. We have been texting, calling and hanging out nonstop and Im starting to catch feelings for him. My ex noticed that me and him were hanging out too much and started getting mad/jealous that i'm talking to someone new within a week of us breaking up. His friends no longer like me because I'm being \"unfair\" to my ex and have no respect for him. I enjoy talking to this new guy, and he treats me better than how my ex did at the beginning when we first started dating.

Block him and his lame friends and go have a great time with you new person.", "The point of a break up is exactly that... a breakup. you can move on however you feel. 6 months is not a long time. i would understand being upset after a couple years together but this is just childish. it seems like he's trying to control you and the relationship by making it on \"his terms\" i.e. why he broke up with you and why he's mad you're out with someone else. Take care of yourself first. he made his decision. \n\nNTA"]}
