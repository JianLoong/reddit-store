BUT you are allowed to name your baby whatever you want especially if you don\u2019t have an issue with her still using the name. I think you can just explain that to her as others have suggested. She may still be sad or disappointed about it, but that\u2019s okay. \n\nI\u2019d probably say something like: \u201cI understand that this name is special to you and you want to use it for your daughter.
