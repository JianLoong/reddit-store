Thanks for understanding.\". Be prepared to leave or hang up if she tries to guilt you into doing what she wants.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL can use the same name someday. You're not restricting her freedom by keeping this name, she shouldn't be restricting yours.", "NTA - \"My partner and I do not care if cousins have the same name\" pretty much sums it up.", "NTA. There are nearly 8 billion people on the planet. There will be other people with that name. She has no ownership of it. Name your kid whatever you want, you had no malicious intent choosing that name and she is free to choose whatever name she would like. If it\u2019s really that sentimental to her, knowing another child in the family has the same name should not make it less special for her.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL has no authority over your child\u2019s name. Don\u2019t let her believe for a second her opinion matters on this issue.", "NTA.  No one owns a name.  You had already decided on that name.  It would be different if you were both aware of SIL's sentiment over the name and then chose it.  I don't think it's fair for SIL to put that pressure on you after you had chosen the name on your own.", "NTA You can't call dibs on baby names despite people's false belief they can. I grew up in a house with John Sr, John Jr and John III. Your sister in law's request was out of line. You and partner are free to name your baby as you see fit.", "NTA\n\nThis is your Daughters name, you both chose it. There is absolutely no reason to change it.\n\nIf your SIL does finally have a girl, she can name her the same, there is no reason cousins can't have the same first name.", "NTA. Sorry to be this blunt but there\u2019s already a baby on the way, she will carry the name that you picked. SIL not even pregnant yet. This is like holding on to a parking spot without a car. She\u2019ll have to settle for another name as your little girl will carry the one she wants.", "NTA. Totally normal for cousins to share a name. Total non issue", "NTA but honestly this kinda seems like a dramatic reaction. She asked you to change the name, nothing suggested she is demanding it and you can say no. Crying over this just seems like a lot.", "NTA - Keep it. If SIL really wants, she can use the name too. If that's not enough for her, then too bad.", "NTA.  What are the odds of all the names in the world, the one you choose your SIL suddenly has 'an attachment' to.  She isn't even pregnant, and since sex selection is illegal in most places, there is no guarantee she would even have a girl.  It's not like she told you this name and you are using it - you came to it independently.  Let her sulk - this isn't your problem.\n\nedit - congrats on the baby - of course you should keep the name you chose.", "I'll go with a conditional NAH depending on how SIL ends up reacting to your keeping the name.  You should definitely keep it, it means something to both parents, and you both love it, and you picked it before you knew what SIL wanted.  SIL is not an AH for asking, but no one owns a name, and as you said, cousins can have the same name with no problems...and she might have only boys, or, sadly but realistically, have no children at all.  She can't claim a name for a child who does not and might never exist.  If she accepts your \"no\" in a mature manner, then NAH.", "an IVF? chances are not good your SIL will ever get that baby.

I will say though if you want to preserve your relationship with your sister in law, you have to be pretty careful about how you talk to her about this. Try not to be snarky or tell her she can't call dibs, because it has to sting a little bit too that she has such an emotional attachment to this name and can't use it. Just be kind and compassionate and you should be good.", "NTA\n\nMy brother and our only male cousin on our fathers side have the same family name. Both have ONE grandson. Both grandson\u2019s have the same family name - and both have the same first name (spelled differently). The two boys live within 5 miles of each other, in fact the older boy actually lived in my village whilst the father of the younger boy also lived here and had his son every other weekend. The only time there has been any confusion was when I was talking to my cousin\u2019s mother because I didn\u2019t realise the two boys had the same name.\n\nMy nephew has now moved away, as has my cousin\u2019s grandsons family.

Very selfish of her to even ask how dare she", "NTA. You can tell her you thought about it, but you and your husband love the name and have planned on it the whole time. Tell her you will have no problem with her naming her baby that as well, when the time comes", "NTA. The only way I\u2019d even consider changing the name would be if SIL is pregnant, knows it\u2019s a girl, and there is corroboration she\u2019d already chosen the name.  \n\nBut even then, you can still do what you want.", "They can ask, but \"no\" is a complete sentence.", "I have a cousin with the same name as me. Never had a problem with it.  I have another cousin who named 2 of her kids the same first names as my 2. We each have a Nick and and an Amanda.
