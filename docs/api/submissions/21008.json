Which is very sweet of them.

I guarantee they wouldn't want their money going toward your sister's college.", "NTA. Excuse me, your sister wants you to pay because she isn't studying enough and your mom agrees with it?\n\nAnyway, do not even discuss with them. It's grandparents' money so all you have to do is to tell them and let them defend their savings", "Oxford is your dream university. Your ~~father~~ grandparents saved for a long time to make it a reality. This is what you and your father both wanted, you have to go for it\n\nNTA. If your sister wanted to go to college, she should have taken her grades more seriously", "Congratulations! It sounds like you have set yourself up for a bright future. I would urge you to show a little compassion toward your half sister - just because she is your half sister. You should NOT be giving her the college fund that your grandparents saved specifically for you. That would not be fair to them. Go pursue your dreams and try to be as kind as possible as you do so. I hope you excel at Oxford!", "**NTA -** The grandparents gave it to you.", "NTA. Why does your sister and mother assume that you could even give your sister the money?  Legally, the money belongs to your grandparents. If you don\u2019t use it, the money stays with your grandparents. The decision to share that money with your sister is up to them.", "NTA. Your sister (or half sister) should not expect you to give up your dream and money you were given so she can peruse hers. That would be like giving a billionaire your last dollar when they haven\u2019t earned it. It\u2019s not fair to someone (you) who earned their dream to give someone (her) their hard earned accomplishment because they (her) didn\u2019t even try. Keep the money and follow your dreams.

You are two separate individuals.", "NTA.   I also think you should consider a more affordable option, but not so that your sister can have the money.  You should consider what the difference will give you as a start in life.  Like, if you go to UCLA, you won't go to Oxford (though you could still do a study abroad there).  But will it leave you enough money for a house, or a downpayment?  Enough to cover grad school?  These are important things you should consider, and probably talk to a financial advisor about.\n\nBut your sister is not part of the equation.  It is not your or your late father's or your grandparents' responsibility to pay for her college education.  That money is intended to give YOU an easier start in life, not to improve the lives of all your siblings.\n\nETA:  I wanted to clarify that I'm not saying you SHOULDN'T go to Oxford.  But you should consider all of your options before making your choice.", "NTA. The money belongs to your grandparents so why are they bothering you about it. Tell them that. Your grandparents have no reason to spend the money on your half sister if you don\u2019t spend it.", "NTA your grandparents saved for YOU not her.

You deserve this and I hope you'll be doing great. :)", "NTA.   \nOxford is an excellent University, and a beautiful city.\n\nHave a great time, spending your money.", "NTA.\n\nThat money is yours. Please honor your grandparents' effort by using that money to realize your life long dream of attending a prestigious institution like Oxford. \n\nIf it was really important for your sister to have a college fund, your mother or her father or her grandparents should have saved up for her. Nobody should be forcing you to give up what is legally yours. Also, yes you are right. She could have worked hard and landed some scholarships too.\n\nOpportunities like Oxford knock once in a blue moon. Please don't let go of that. You'll regret it later.\n\nFly to London!

If they have, they probably had a *very* good reason as you just found out.  \nYour parents never saved up money for both you and your sister so she would have been left without options if it wasn't for your fortune. That makes me believe they either knew or at least suspected your grandparents had something stashed away for you.\n\nEnjoy your time in Oxford, man. There's no better way of spending crazy amounts of money at your age than on education and life experience.", "Oxford, eh? A big super congratulations from me. Good luck and NTA. \n\nYour sister can go pound sand. Your mom and step father too for not saving for their daughter\u2019s tuition.

To be honest, if I were the paternal grandparents, I\u2019d be pretty pissed if you gave my money that I had saved specifically for you to someone wholly unconnected to me. In fact, you should sit down with your grandparents and explain what\u2019s happening.

If she never buckled down to get good grades, she is probably just going to end up dropping out.\n\nA good local community college is probably the right way for her to go, she doesn't need to carry a full load and if she steps up her game, she can transfer to a 4 year college and go from there.", "If you turn down the money, it's not going to her.

My dad cut all ties with me when I was 15, though, so I didn't get any of that, and I was a much lazier student (something I resolved in my early 20's after an ADHD diagnosis and some treatment).\n\nI don't hold it against my brother, but you need to realize that being on the other side of that dichotomy is a very painful place to be. Not everyone is born with the same aptitude to excel in academics, and not everyone grows and matures at the same rate. My brother always found studying and time management easy, for me it was the hardest thing in the world. To see academics and good study habits come so naturally to my brother, and then to see him receive so much support *in addition* to that... it's a painful thing for an adolescent to cope with. The fact that it wasn't my brother's fault doesn't make it hurt any less.\n\nGo to Oxford, do great things, but please be kind to your half-sister and understand that she's learning a very difficult lesson about how life can be unfair.", "My little cousin was at Oxford uni two days ago to make her final decision on where she wants to go.

Go to Oxford and live your best life. Good Luck \u2764\ufe0f", "[deleted]", "NTA. Couple of other arguments:\n\n- Considering where you have been admitted (Berkeley, Oxford, Cornell), you are clearly an exceptional student. While college is generally losing its status as a good investment for anyone but the top students (especially in STEM which appears to be your domain given the schools on your list).  Spending $200k+ on a top class research institution like Oxford is a much better bet than spending the same money on a basket weaving degree from a party school.\n- Getting financial aid usually involvea you taking on significant debt. Unless you are funded entirely by scholarships, choosing to go to school in the US might just mean paying for college later. I suspect you won't get repaid for giving your money to your sister.\n\nI actually don't buy into the argument of blood relations. If you won the lottery, your family could (depending on the family) still expect you to help the family out financially (especially with big ticket items like college). The fact that the money came from your dad doesn't mean your mom should never see a penny of it. Ultimately, you would be helping your mother fulfil HER duties as a parent (even if the sister is the beneficiary). \n\nYour mother probably wants to ensure that both her kids are set up well for life. Given you are doing well academically, she is probably more worried about making sure your sister is also given a good platform in life. This does not make her a bad parent just because she thinks your sister needs more financial support than you do. In fact, it signifies more trust in you. Your mother is NTA and your sister might also have been misled with her expectations. Don't ruin your family ties over this.\n\nLast but not least, do consider if actually going to Oxford is financially and emotionally prudent. You might not enjoy it as you might be saddled with the guilt of depriving your sister. On the other hand, the US schools you have been admitted to are absolutely top notch institutions which would still allow you to go to Oxford for a Masters or a PhD which would typically be free/cheaper. \n\nIn the meantime, you could have your grandparents lock up the money invested in a trust, fixed deposits or an immovable asset (like a property) so that your family does not see it as money you have access to. This would be financially and emotionally prudent.", "NTA, your mom should\u2019ve saved up for her.

You shouldn't have any obligation to share that money. Your step father or his parents should have saved for your sister. However, I would encourage you to go to college for cheaper in the US and save money for grad school or future living expenses. What's the best college you can get a good scholarship to? If you can get into Oxford, there must be a high end college here that would offer you a very nice academic scholarship. I'd bet an in-state school would give you a full ride. Where you get your undergrad degree isn't that important.\n\nI remember being your age and being elitist about what college I wanted, but the reality is that most employers care far more about your actual knowledge and experience than what college you went to. For example, instead of working a menial job over the summer, spend money on a professional program you're interested in that summer.

Your grandparents and father would want you to go to the school of your dreams.\n\nI'm a little confused though, why is it assumed that your grandparents' money can be used for someone else? Maybe the grandparents said that's fine and if so, that's very generous but I personally would not be ok with my money being repurposed.\n\nFurthermore, no one is ENTITLED to college. You earned your way into an amazing college. Your life will change by moving to a different country and experiencing a completely different way of life. Do not let people bully you with guilt! Best of luck!", "Mom has no access to this money, right? I don\u2019t want to accuse anyone, but it sounds like she\u2019d have no problem swiping a good chunk of it for your half-sister.", "NTA. Your sister is not entitled to that money. Both she and your mother are out of line.", "NTA- the money is for you! Why would your grandparents give the money they saved up for you to someone they\u2019re not related to?\nIf your sister wants to go to college, she can make it happen! I had little to no help financially- I worked, took out loans, grants, and had a work study. If you want something bad enough, you find a way to make it happen.\nCongratulations on getting into your dream school- enjoy it without any guilt! You earned it!", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, congratulations! \n\nWould it be *very* generous of you to give your fund to her? Yes. \n\nAre you obliged to do so? Not at all.\n\nYou're her brother, not her guardian. It's not your responsibility to provide for your sister. That's on your sister and parents. And why should her dream come before yours? I don't think it's fair that your mom and sister are asking you to compromise and give up the money your paternal grandparents set up for you (which your sister would have no right to). With that said, be prepared for your relationships with your family to change going forward, though IMO, an opportunity to go to Oxford would be worth it. You deserve it.", "NTA - mum and dad are at fault for not setting up a college fund for her! \n\nShe also has a set of grandparents not related to you, why didn\u2019t they do it? \n\nIf the shoes was on the other foot, would she help you? Would your mum ask her to pay for your college? The answer is no! \n\nAlso tell your grandparents about this, to make sure your mum and sister can get any of your money and if they start getting too much, you have a place to go to.", "I'm mad at the mother asking her son to give up on his hardwork-earned dream for the sister who just failed to get the bare minimum for college. I say go to oxford and never look back. No one should ever ask anyone to give up their hard earned fruits. Them doing that is the most toxic and selfish thing I have heard of.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your problem your half-sister has shitty grades. \n\nShe's also not entitled to any of your paternal grandparents money.\n\nYour mom and your half-sister have no place dictating how you should spend YOUR college fund.\n\nYour mom and half-sister seem toxic. \n\nLose contact with them. \n\nMove away.\n\nDon't take shit from anyone.\n\nLive your dream.", "NTA. Technically, it's not your money to give.  Your paternal grandparents saved for YOU to go to college, perhaps hoping that your father would have done the same.  I wouldn't ask them to jump into the fray of entitlement that is your mom and sister.  \n\nI also noted that your mother didn't go directly to your grandparents to make the request.  Perhaps because she knew it was ridiculous to expect them to pay for a another family's grandchild?  \n\nYour grandparents are very generous, say thank you very much and use the money as intended.\n\nLots of people figure out ways to get a college education.  If your sister can't buckle down and do well in high school, how does she possibly think she's going to do in college?\n\nEdited to add:  Congratulations, OP!  Go forth and learn much!", "Nope.

NTA", "Look, OP... please. Go to the university of your choice. If money was of concern to you, go to an American university and save the college fund to buy a home after you graduate. Don't give it to your sister or parents. That money isn't theirs to count so they shouldn't be licking their chops at it. \n\nYou said yourself that Oxford is your dream. What more is there to consider? Go! You sound brilliant and I can't stand to imagine you wasting your years away elsewhere. Maybe Cornell is different but most of the UC campuses have become degree manufacturers. A bachelors from a UC has less value today than it did even a few years ago. After the budget cuts on education, universities needed a way to pay for everything with less money from the government. Which led to accepting more undergrad students who were and are paying much higher fees to attend, going into debt to do it. But this also watered down the value of the degree because in order to accept more students, there had to be some lowering of their rigorous standards. This has been reflected in many job positions suddenly requiring a minimum of a masters degree for positions that in the past didn't require it. \n\nBut all that aside, if Oxford is your dream and you don't go, you will forever spend your life knowing you could have gone but didn't. It's not personal. It's just your dream. Just tell them with complete and total confidence that you will be going as though there was no other option. Your sister's situation is her's to deal with and if your parents feel so strongly, they can make it happen for her by contributing their own funds. This is 100% your accomplishment, your hard work that you are reaping the reward from and your grandparents would want no less than for their money to be spent fulfilling your dreams.", "Congratulations on Oxford!

She will 100% tell anyone that I'm smarter than her. \n\nI also don't get the \"dream school\" thing. Like the overall education isn't that drastically different. Biggest difference is some schools will give you a leg up based on connections via alumni and some schools have better programs for specific things. If I was OPs parent I'd be telling them to take the school that they have a free ride/large scholarship at and save that college fund to start their adult life when they're done school.
