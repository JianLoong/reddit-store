Excuse me, your sister wants you to pay because she isn't studying enough and your mom agrees with it?\n\nAnyway, do not even discuss with them. It's grandparents' money so all you have to do is to tell them and let them defend their savings", "Oxford is your dream university. Your father saved for a long time to make it a reality. This is what you both wanted, you have to go for it\n\nNTA. If your sister wanted to go to college, she should have taken her grades more seriously", "Congratulations! It sounds like you have set yourself up for a bright future. I would urge you to show a little compassion toward your half sister - just because she is your half sister. You should NOT be giving her the college fund that your grandparents saved specifically for you. That would not be fair to them. Go pursue your dreams and try to be as kind as possible as you do so. I hope you excel at Oxford!", "**NTA -** The grandparents gave it to you.", "NTA. Why does your sister and mother assume that you could even give your sister the money?  Legally, the money belongs to your grandparents. If you don\u2019t use it, the money stays with your grandparents. The decision to share that money with your sister is up to them.", "NTA. Your sister (or half sister) should not expect you to give up your dream and money you were given so she can peruse hers. That would be like giving a billionaire your last dollar when they haven\u2019t earned it. It\u2019s not fair to someone (you) who earned their dream to give someone (her) their hard earned accomplishment because they (her) didn\u2019t even try. Keep the money and follow your dreams.

You are two separate individuals.", "NTA.   I also think you should consider a more affordable option, but not so that your sister can have the money.  You should consider what the difference will give you as a start in life.  Like, if you go to UCLA, you won't go to Oxford (though you could still do a study abroad there).  But will it leave you enough money for a house, or a downpayment?  Enough to cover grad school?  These are important things you should consider, and probably talk to a financial advisor about.\n\nBut your sister is not part of the equation.  It is not your or your late father's or your grandparents' responsibility to pay for her college education.  That money is intended to give YOU an easier start in life, not to improve the lives of all your siblings.\n\nETA:  I wanted to clarify that I'm not saying you SHOULDN'T go to Oxford.  But you should consider all of your options before making your choice.", "NTA. The money belongs to your grandparents so why are they bothering you about it. Tell them that. Your grandparents have no reason to spend the money on your half sister if you don\u2019t spend it.", "NTA your grandparents saved for YOU not her.

You deserve this and I hope you'll be doing great. :)", "NTA.   \nOxford is an excellent University, and a beautiful city.\n\nHave a great time, spending your money.", "NTA.\n\nThat money is yours. Please honor your grandparents' effort by using that money to realize your life long dream of attending a prestigious institution like Oxford. \n\nIf it was really important for your sister to have a college fund, your mother or her father or her grandparents should have saved up for her. Nobody should be forcing you to give up what is legally yours. Also, yes you are right. She could have worked hard and landed some scholarships too.\n\nOpportunities like Oxford knock once in a blue moon. Please don't let go of that. You'll regret it later.\n\nFly to London!

If they have, they probably had a *very* good reason as you just found out.  \nYour parents never saved up money for both you and your sister so she would have been left without options if it wasn't for your fortune. That makes me believe they either knew or at least suspected your grandparents had something stashed away for you.\n\nEnjoy your time in Oxford, man. There's no better way of spending crazy amounts of money at your age than on education and life experience.", "Oxford, eh? A big super congratulations from me. Good luck and NTA. \n\nYour sister can go pound sand. Your mom and step father too for not saving for their daughter\u2019s tuition.

To be honest, if I were the paternal grandparents, I\u2019d be pretty pissed if you gave my money that I had saved specifically for you to someone wholly unconnected to me. In fact, you should sit down with your grandparents and explain what\u2019s happening.

If she never buckled down to get good grades, she is probably just going to end up dropping out.\n\nA good local community college is probably the right way for her to go, she doesn't need to carry a full load and if she steps up her game, she can transfer to a 4 year college and go from there.", "If you turn down the money, it's not going to her.
