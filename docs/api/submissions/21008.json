This year, I applied to colleges, and got into my dream school, Oxford. To clarify, I\u2019m American, so not eligible for most forms of financial aid, and going there would wipe out most of my college fund.\n\nI also got into some really good options in the US, like Berkeley, UCLA, and Cornell, all with really generous scholarships/financial aid that meant I could attend very affordably.\n\nI considered all my options, and decided that it was worth paying more for Oxford because a) it will get me closer to my long term goals and b) it\u2019s been a lifelong dream of mine to attend.\n\nMy sister and mom didn\u2019t like this decision. Essentially, they wanted me to go to an affordable option and give the college fund to my sister. This is because my sister doesn\u2019t have the grades to get scholarships and will need money to pay for college, whereas I can go for almost free.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s my problem. My sister isn\u2019t even related to my dad or grandparents, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to give the money to her.

I pointed out she was doing the same thing, asking me to give up my dream.\n\nShe called me a selfish AH.

Maybe it will teach her to appreciate learning.", "NTA at all. You are not making her sacrifice her dreams, she did it with her poor grades.", "NTA.\n\n**your** paternal grandparents are sponsoring **your** dream so why does she not ask **her** paternal grandparents to sponsor **her** dream?", "NTA.\n\nYour grandparents saved it for you. Which is very sweet of them. I do feel sorry for your sister that she hadn\u2019t had the same luck. \n\nBut honestly.. don\u2019t pass up the opportunity of going to Oxford - I don\u2019t know about the American universities but Cambridge is pretty fantastic so I assume the same applies to Oxford :) congrats btw!", "NTA.  Basically your mother and half sister want your grandparents to fund an education for a girl they have no relationship with. It's their money for your college education, not yours for her college education.", "NTA\n\nTell your Paternal Grandparents what's going on.  I guarantee they wouldn't want their money going toward your sister's college.", "NTA. Excuse me, your sister wants you to pay because she isn't studying enough and your mom agrees with it?\n\nAnyway, do not even discuss with them. It's grandparents' money so all you have to do is to tell them and let them defend their savings", "Oxford is your dream university. Your father saved for a long time to make it a reality. This is what you both wanted, you have to go for it\n\nNTA. If your sister wanted to go to college, she should have taken her grades more seriously", "Congratulations! It sounds like you have set yourself up for a bright future. I would urge you to show a little compassion toward your half sister - just because she is your half sister. You should NOT be giving her the college fund that your grandparents saved specifically for you. That would not be fair to them. Go pursue your dreams and try to be as kind as possible as you do so. I hope you excel at Oxford!", "**NTA -** The grandparents gave it to you.", "NTA. Why does your sister and mother assume that you could even give your sister the money?  Legally, the money belongs to your grandparents. If you don\u2019t use it, the money stays with your grandparents. The decision to share that money with your sister is up to them.", "NTA. Your sister (or half sister) should not expect you to give up your dream and money you were given so she can peruse hers. That would be like giving a billionaire your last dollar when they haven\u2019t earned it. It\u2019s not fair to someone (you) who earned their dream to give someone (her) their hard earned accomplishment because they (her) didn\u2019t even try. Keep the money and follow your dreams. She has to learn to work hard for what she wants and this is the perfect opportunity for her to do so.", "NTA they should have started to save for her instead of trying to take your money", "NTA", "NTA. It's not her money and will never be her money. This is *your* college fund from *your dead dad's parents*. She doesn't get to make you feel bad because you had someone looking out for you.", "NTA.  You are not selfish.  Your sister is entitled.  If you get a good job but your sister  doesn't  does she expect you to support her for the rest of her life. You are two separate individuals.", "NTA.   I also think you should consider a more affordable option, but not so that your sister can have the money.  You should consider what the difference will give you as a start in life.  Like, if you go to UCLA, you won't go to Oxford (though you could still do a study abroad there).  But will it leave you enough money for a house, or a downpayment?  Enough to cover grad school?  These are important things you should consider, and probably talk to a financial advisor about.\n\nBut your sister is not part of the equation.  It is not your or your late father's or your grandparents' responsibility to pay for her college education.  That money is intended to give YOU an easier start in life, not to improve the lives of all your siblings.\n\nETA:  I wanted to clarify that I'm not saying you SHOULDN'T go to Oxford.  But you should consider all of your options before making your choice.", "NTA. The money belongs to your grandparents so why are they bothering you about it. Tell them that. Your grandparents have no reason to spend the money on your half sister if you don\u2019t spend it.", "NTA your grandparents saved for YOU not her. Tell your grandparents what your mom and sister are saying and have them lay it down, even if you DON'T use the money it's never going to be your sister's.", "NTA.\n\nCongratulations on getting accepted into your dream university, I'm sure your dad would be proud - and your grandparents surely are as well!\n\nStand your ground. You deserve this and I hope you'll be doing great. :)", "NTA.   \nOxford is an excellent University, and a beautiful city.\n\nHave a great time, spending your money.", "NTA.\n\nThat money is yours. Please honor your grandparents' effort by using that money to realize your life long dream of attending a prestigious institution like Oxford. \n\nIf it was really important for your sister to have a college fund, your mother or her father or her grandparents should have saved up for her. Nobody should be forcing you to give up what is legally yours. Also, yes you are right. She could have worked hard and landed some scholarships too.\n\nOpportunities like Oxford knock once in a blue moon. Please don't let go of that. You'll regret it later.\n\nFly to London! Chase your dreams. I really think you can use some distance between you and your family.", "NTA\n\nReading your other posts makes it pretty clear they've been banking on your college fund for a long time. Unless your grandparents kept them in the dark about the money they've saved for you. If they have, they probably had a *very* good reason as you just found out.  \nYour parents never saved up money for both you and your sister so she would have been left without options if it wasn't for your fortune. That makes me believe they either knew or at least suspected your grandparents had something stashed away for you.\n\nEnjoy your time in Oxford, man. There's no better way of spending crazy amounts of money at your age than on education and life experience.", "Oxford, eh? A big super congratulations from me. Good luck and NTA. \n\nYour sister can go pound sand. Your mom and step father too for not saving for their daughter\u2019s tuition. Shame on them. \n\nDo the world proud at Oxford and go NC with those oafs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mother and stepfather should have funded a college account for her. Your paternal grandparents saved for you, and were not obligated to save for her. If her dream was to go to college, she should have tried harder in high school.", "> I think she\u2019s at fault here\n\nThere is no fault to assign to anyone.  Everyone gets what the deserve.  That applies to you and your sister.  The college fund was a gift from your grandparents.

Second of all, your sister and mom are huge gaping AHs to use the money that was saved for you to attend college because she didn\u2019t do the work. Who says she could get into said Dream School? The fact that she isn\u2019t even related to them and expects to use it is mind blowing. You will never be the AH for using your money for your dreams.", "NTA. Did your stepfather and mother save nothing for either of your colleges? Because anything they had saved can be used for your half sister so she is also getting an indirect benefit. If not, then you would both be in the same situation.  You lost your father, and your grandparents, in his stead, saved for your education. Thats not your sister's business. Your mother can pay for her daughter like your father paid for you. Enjoy Oxford.", "NTA\nYour grandparents want you to be able to go to the college you desire. Don't disappoint them.", "Have fun and kick butt at Oxford!!! It will be amazing - also keep close with your grandparents bc your mom and step Dad won\u2019t help.", "NTA.  Not her family, not her money.  It's for you to use.", "NTA\n\nBut also, I thought Oxford did have international grants. 1 daughter wants to go to Sapenzia in Rome, and 1 Oxford. I know I saw Sapenzia had international grants, I thought I saw Oxford did too.\n\nCongrats getting into your dream school!!", "NTA, but why do you think it makes no sense to give financial support to family members you're not biologically related to?  My brother has 3 step kids, and he and my parents support them because they are family, which makes plenty of sense to me.  You are free to use your money how you want, but don't be shocked when some people are generous with family they aren't biologically connected to.", "NTA but I hope you\u2019re hiding that money! Don\u2019t tell them what bank or leave any trace of the bank info anywhere. Lock down your credit and make sure you never leave your bank card and banking apps unattended, 2 step verification on everything.", "NTA your grandparents didn\u2019t save there hard earned money for your sister to go to school they saved it for you.

Not your circus, not your monkey NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA and frankly, it\u2019s not your money to give away, even if you wanted to. It\u2019s your grandparents.

Go to Oxford :)", "Please tell your grandparents what\u2019s going on. This way, if they still have the option to pay for Oxford directly, they can.", "NTA. These funds have absolutely nothing to do with her. Do not sacrifice your dream for someone who has no claim on the means to achieve it.  To be honest, if I were the paternal grandparents, I\u2019d be pretty pissed if you gave my money that I had saved specifically for you to someone wholly unconnected to me. In fact, you should sit down with your grandparents and explain what\u2019s happening.  They can set it up where little money is going directly to you but will be paid directly to the school, landlord, etc.  This way, there\u2019s no way you can \u201cgive\u201d the college fund to the half sister. You can then tell your mom to take it up with the grandparents if she keeps insisting. I\u2019d gladly take that hit for my grandchild. I\u2019d shut that entitled BS down. \n\nGo\u2026embrace the adventure.", "NTA.

That's how you got your dad's. He saved", "I have a friend who put himself through UC Berkeley, and got his PhD, by working in grocery stores. Your sister can do the same.", "And her mother and father failed her by not putting savings aside for her college.", "If you can, take the opportunity to check out the many, many museums in the UK. Almost all are free to enter and be prepared for the culture change.\n\nBut don't worry, most Brits are friendly, and by the time you're done with your degree, you'll be a tea drinking addict. Real tea with the water boiled in the kettle, not the microwave", "You're very welcome\n\nYou're also allowed to be incredibly proud of yourself. Getting accepted to Oxford is an achievement most people could only dream of, and you made it\n\nYour sister will be fine. She'll grow up and mature, eventually"]}
