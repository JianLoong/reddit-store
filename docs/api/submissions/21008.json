Excuse me, your sister wants you to pay because she isn't studying enough and your mom agrees with it?\n\nAnyway, do not even discuss with them. It's grandparents' money so all you have to do is to tell them and let them defend their savings", "Oxford is your dream university. Your father saved for a long time to make it a reality. This is what you both wanted, you have to go for it\n\nNTA. If your sister wanted to go to college, she should have taken her grades more seriously", "Congratulations! It sounds like you have set yourself up for a bright future. I would urge you to show a little compassion toward your half sister - just because she is your half sister. You should NOT be giving her the college fund that your grandparents saved specifically for you. That would not be fair to them. Go pursue your dreams and try to be as kind as possible as you do so. I hope you excel at Oxford!", "**NTA -** The grandparents gave it to you.", "NTA. Why does your sister and mother assume that you could even give your sister the money?  Legally, the money belongs to your grandparents. If you don\u2019t use it, the money stays with your grandparents. The decision to share that money with your sister is up to them.", "NTA. Your sister (or half sister) should not expect you to give up your dream and money you were given so she can peruse hers. That would be like giving a billionaire your last dollar when they haven\u2019t earned it. It\u2019s not fair to someone (you) who earned their dream to give someone (her) their hard earned accomplishment because they (her) didn\u2019t even try. Keep the money and follow your dreams.

You are two separate individuals.", "NTA.   I also think you should consider a more affordable option, but not so that your sister can have the money.  You should consider what the difference will give you as a start in life.  Like, if you go to UCLA, you won't go to Oxford (though you could still do a study abroad there).  But will it leave you enough money for a house, or a downpayment?  Enough to cover grad school?  These are important things you should consider, and probably talk to a financial advisor about.\n\nBut your sister is not part of the equation.  It is not your or your late father's or your grandparents' responsibility to pay for her college education.  That money is intended to give YOU an easier start in life, not to improve the lives of all your siblings.\n\nETA:  I wanted to clarify that I'm not saying you SHOULDN'T go to Oxford.  But you should consider all of your options before making your choice.", "NTA. The money belongs to your grandparents so why are they bothering you about it. Tell them that. Your grandparents have no reason to spend the money on your half sister if you don\u2019t spend it.", "NTA your grandparents saved for YOU not her.

You deserve this and I hope you'll be doing great. :)", "NTA.   \nOxford is an excellent University, and a beautiful city.\n\nHave a great time, spending your money.", "NTA.\n\nThat money is yours. Please honor your grandparents' effort by using that money to realize your life long dream of attending a prestigious institution like Oxford. \n\nIf it was really important for your sister to have a college fund, your mother or her father or her grandparents should have saved up for her. Nobody should be forcing you to give up what is legally yours. Also, yes you are right. She could have worked hard and landed some scholarships too.\n\nOpportunities like Oxford knock once in a blue moon. Please don't let go of that. You'll regret it later.\n\nFly to London!

If they have, they probably had a *very* good reason as you just found out.  \nYour parents never saved up money for both you and your sister so she would have been left without options if it wasn't for your fortune. That makes me believe they either knew or at least suspected your grandparents had something stashed away for you.\n\nEnjoy your time in Oxford, man. There's no better way of spending crazy amounts of money at your age than on education and life experience.", "Oxford, eh? A big super congratulations from me. Good luck and NTA. \n\nYour sister can go pound sand. Your mom and step father too for not saving for their daughter\u2019s tuition.

If she never buckled down to get good grades, she is probably just going to end up dropping out.\n\nA good local community college is probably the right way for her to go, she doesn't need to carry a full load and if she steps up her game, she can transfer to a 4 year college and go from there.", "If you turn down the money, it's not going to her.

My dad cut all ties with me when I was 15, though, so I didn't get any of that, and I was a much lazier student (something I resolved in my early 20's after an ADHD diagnosis and some treatment).\n\nI don't hold it against my brother, but you need to realize that being on the other side of that dichotomy is a very painful place to be. Not everyone is born with the same aptitude to excel in academics, and not everyone grows and matures at the same rate. My brother always found studying and time management easy, for me it was the hardest thing in the world. To see academics and good study habits come so naturally to my brother, and then to see him receive so much support *in addition* to that... it's a painful thing for an adolescent to cope with. The fact that it wasn't my brother's fault doesn't make it hurt any less.\n\nGo to Oxford, do great things, but please be kind to your half-sister and understand that she's learning a very difficult lesson about how life can be unfair.", "My little cousin was at Oxford uni two days ago to make her final decision on where she wants to go.

That takes you out of the equation, as far as the money goes, and then there isn't any question of you giving it to your sister. It isn't hers.  It isn't yours. It isn't your mum's.  It's your grandparent's money, and they can pay for the uni fees with it if they want to.", "NTA and time to go LC with your step-sister.  Shame on your mom for trying to guilt trip you.  Go LC with her too.", "Officially, I\u2019d say NTA. But as a half sibling with the less desirable other parent, man, that would be tough. I feel for your sister. \n\nI\u2019d also just want to say that college choice has such a small influence on those life goals. \n\nAnd also, congratulations on all the acceptances and options available to you.

I have a feeling they will need to hear this. Good Luck!", "NTA. Oxford is one of the few schools that comes with a pedigree in addition to an education, which, unlike the Ivies in the USA, is guaranteed to come with key professional connections and not just fancy branding.

She should worry about her own grades.", "NTA - enjoy Oxford :)", "That\u2019s not how a 509 plan works if that\u2019s what your grandparents have invested in. Only they can change the beneficiary.

It's not some lump sum of Dad's money, or Dad's life insurance or anything. \n\nIMO using it for anything other than OP's own college costs would require going back to their grandparents to discuss it, ethically, if not legally.

Your sister's grades are not your problem, most likely she'd continue performing poorly at college and simply \"waste\" YOUR college fund, whereas you can take it to OXFORD.\n\nEdit: if your sister can't maintain good grades in high school, she will not succeed at college and the money will be completely wasted. Perhaps it's even safer to allow your grandparents to retain control of the money while you studie so no shenanigans happen.", "OP don't let them manipulate or guilt you thinking you are selfish and wrong so NTA.

If you don't have the grades to get into college you aren't going to be successful anyway. Failing out of school sets them up for huge debt and no jobs. I personally didn't mature enough to go until later in life. Now I owe a hundred grand in debt though.  There are tons of jobs you don't need a degree for and your sister will be better off getting a career instead of just going because \"that's what you are supposed to do.\"", "Plus seeing how her grades were in high school who's to say she wouldn't funk out of college if you did help her out?

It is possible his mother knew earlier but it sounds like they've not saved anything for either child. \n\nOP has your mother & step-father saved anything towards your education?

You pretty much got money saved from grandparents because your dad unfortunately isn't here to do it. Ask your half sis if her dad's worth your money...", "That money is your Father/Grandparents gift to you. You lost a father and I\u2019m sure you would trade this money to know him instead.

You earned it.", "Congratulations, OP! I hope your next update will be life in a new continent and not about US college life (you shouldn't have to give up your dreams for anyone, and your paternal grandparents saved money for YOU, not your half sister).", "OP I have given you my input and whatever you do protect your uni fund", "Yes, please do tell your grandparents what's going on, OP. This is YOUR money saved by YOUR dad and grandparents. No one else is entitled to a cent. Stand firm and follow your dream.", "Half sister", "Actually, the grandparents saved.

That's why she didn't work harder in school.", "It\u2019s pretty common to go to community college for a year to get the basics out of the way where the credit hours are cheaper.

So yeah, you could work part time in the summer and pay for college.  In state tuition is now over 12,000 dollars a year - so working with Washington's generous minimum wage, you would need to work over 20 weeks full time just to cover tuition, far more than that to cover books/room and board.", "It's a half-sister, not a step-sister.
