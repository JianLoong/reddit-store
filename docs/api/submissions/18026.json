Here are just the top 5 low points.\n\n1. Left me on my own at 14 while she took dad to Malta for two weeks (her son was meant to care for me)\n2. Left me, fianc\u00e9 and 1 week old daughter as hospital after going to the wrong hospital and it being too difficult to get to the right one.\n3. Offending the entire family at my nana funeral twice!\n4. demanding my mothers inheritance money given to me when I turned 18.\n5. Sending vile message via messenger when drunk lambasting me for not taking in my mentally disabled aunt for 6-8 weeks a year to give my dad a break\n\nNow onto why I could be the asshat.  I\u2019m due to get married in 2 months, and in the UK you need to \u201cgive notice\u201d of marriage. This is where you go to the registrar and show you have a right to be married in the UK. For that I needed my late mothers birth certificate. My dad dutifully brought it up from down south to up north, I had to go over the day before the appointment to get the documents I needed. Dad was out at the time (I wasn\u2019t aware I was told he would be there) and SM has her adult kids over with their family\u2019s. I parked up on the road, dismounted and took off my helmet and gloves but left the rest of my bike gear on as I only intended to stay a few minutes say hello, get the documents and leave. (I actually didn\u2019t need them as I had ordered copies just in case)\nShe opens the door and informs me dad isn\u2019t there and refuses to hand over the documents (waving them in my face) because I can\u2019t marry that \u201cwoman\u201d who I have a child with (been with soon to be wife for 12 years) as it\u2019s not right that it\u2019s not a religious ceremony, it\u2019s a civil ceremony and that\u2019s what we can afford. \nShe also said how evil I am for not inviting her. This is true as we can\u2019t stand her and we don\u2019t want the hassle.\nSo I let rip with all the shit she\u2019s done, a full 15 minute loud rant tearing her a new one for all the shit she\u2019s done and all the damage she has done and how she claims to be the victim and how I\u2019m sick of her shit, and finally who the F is she to withhold my late mothers birth certificate from me for bullshit reasons. I snatched them out of her hand and left leaving her at the door with a face like a slapped arse and her kids questioning what I was talking about. \nLater my dad called to ask what happened and I told him. He only heard what SM wanted him to hear and said while he agrees with my reaction and he will be having words with her. but he thinks I went too far with the rant.\nI said \u201cnot my problem she could have just handed over the documents like I asked\u201d which he agreed to drop it as she is in the wrong.
