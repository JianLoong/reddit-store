To get an account closed due to fraud is not an easy thing, your brother's transactions clued the bank into the fact he's doing something shady enough the bank could get into trouble. \n\n He can get his wages as a check and cash it like some people do, OR he can go to a different bank and open an account there. \n\nYou are not in the wrong. People used to help your brother until they realized he was abusing their good natures. You say no once and he's decided you never help him ever with anything. He is lying.", "The reason you \"have to be dealing with this stuff\" is that you have already been dealing with his problems of one kind or another. So now he expects you to be his savior.\n\nYour brother appears to be a mess who can't get his life straight, so he wants to rely on you to fix everything. In other words, to drag you down. \n\nWhy couldn't his friends help him out? was your question. And his answer was \"It would mess up their finances.\"\n\nSo instead he's going to mess up yours?\n\nTell him no. NTA.", "op=NTA\n\nhe says it would mess up his FRIENDS finances but he has no problem with it messing up yours?\n\nand if he put's money in, will he have the ability to take money out--BIG NO.\n\nEmployers can issue him a check he can take it to a store that cashes payroll checks/or a check cashing place  OR some employers can put it on a debit card.  \n\nDO NOT LET HIM ANYWHERE NEAR your financial vendors(banks, etc).", "NTA: You are being used. If his account was close or frozen due to fraud, then he was either depositing shady checks, constantly going negative, going to shady websites for fast loans that will give you a few hundred dollars but then fee the shit out of you and then the bank doesn't want your business because you bring nothing positive to their establishment. Sure, maybe he had fraud because money was being taken out he didn't authorize. But I bet it was from shady websites. He sounds slow with technology and many people get scammed due to this. \n\nDO NOT let him use your account. You will regret it immensely. He can cash his checks at the banks they're drawn on, eat a small fee, and be on his way.\n\nSource: I was a bank teller for 8 years. I've seen ALL types of fraud.", "NTA and never allow anyone to access your bank account. Why does he think it would not be ok to \"mess up\" his friends' finances but ok to do so to yours? \n\nThere is more than one bank he could use. If he's done something that would prevent him from getting an account at another bank, that's an even bigger reason this is a no.", "NTA. He could easily open a new account elsewhere", "DON'T let you brother have access. It's suspect that the bank wouldn't allow him access to his account unless he was the one committing the fraud.  Tell him to do a google search to see what his options are.  Your brother is taking advantage of you. No is a complete sentence. NTA", "NTA. His story is nonsense. He wants to steal from you and purchase drugs.", "Absolutely NTA. Never, ever sign credit or give ANYONE else access to your bank account. You are asking for trouble if you do.", "NTA\n\nTough shit.\n\nHe can cash his checks and buy money orders for rent/prepaid debit card.\n\nEspecially with substance abuse issues I wouldn\u2019t want him or his money anywhere near my bank account, and his justification for why his current bank account is closed sounds incredibly suspicious.", "NTA. Never let your dodgy family near your accounts. The words \u201cmoney laundering\u201d seem relevant. He is as shady as hell. Scold him.", "NTA. This would violate your contract with your bank unless you specifically added him as a signer.", "NTA. He\u2019s gonna scam/fuck you over. Absolutely never allow this", "Also his job is required to give paper check if requested. He could just go to a check cashing place.", "Or, marry someone you trust", "> It seems like if I could put my money straight into a debit card, and/or use a card for cashing paychecks, then I would be safer and have more control over it.\n\nhow to be confidentially financially illiterate", "I\u2019d advise you to search and enroll in a free online financial literacy course.
