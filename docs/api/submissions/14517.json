I have had a prepaid Walmart visa card for over a decade. Free direct deposit, halfway decent app. Best part is that I can never spend more than I have cuz it won't let me overdraft. Second best part is that I don't even  have to step foot into a Walmart to use it. US Bank ATMs are free and Money pass 7/11 ATMs are like $1-2 per transaction. Bill pay and money transfer service included. There's no reason for him to use ur account these days with all the prepaid visa options out there.", "NTA don\u2019t let him near your account only bad things will happen. In the U.K. there are also sorts of new banks that are app based and super quick to sign up to, wherever you are, you could always do a little research for him about the quickest and easiest way to sign up for a new account", "NTA, this sounds fishy. Protect yourself, please.", "NTA.   \nIf he starts using your bank account will he start then demanding to see your bank statements to prove his money is in there? Will he start showing up at random hours demanding you cash it out for him? What\u2019s the deal with that? Will he want a key card? Have access to YOUR cash? Nope nope nope. He doesn\u2019t sound trustworthy/ stable enough for this. \n\nWhy\u2019d he come to you? Because you are a soft touch and will \u2018help him\u2019 or go along. Time to put some boundaries in. \u201cSorry brother, I\u2019ve got to keep my finances clear for myself right now, I can\u2019t afford to even have your pay come into my account because it might mess up some of my payments\u201d (and this is particularly true if you get any government support, or file taxes as a self employed person, or this looks like wages coming Into your account you should be paying tax on but are not).  Its entirely possible his mates dont want to do this for him for these reasons, or it pushes them over income thresholds for things like food stamps or subsidised housing or he\u2019s been a complete jerk to them in the past over it all and they don\u2019t trust him either.", "NTA. Given your history this is raising some alarm bells. The most you could agree to is allowing his salary to be deposited into yours and then withdrawing the amount in cash. This won't be an option for you in a lot of countries. \n\nRegardless, he absolutely cannot have access to your funds. There may be an option for his employer to pay him in cash if the issue is genuine. I did this at my last job after a new start from a different country had trouble getting their account open by the first pay date.", "So he doesn't want to ask his friends for help because by his own admission it would 'mess up their finances', but he's fine with messing up yours? \ud83e\udd28\n\nNTA and don't let him anywhere near your account.", "NTA. You really can't do this.", "Nope nope nope. He has burned every single bridge and now wants to set the only one he has left on fire. Don\u2019t let him use your bank account. You are a smart person to say no. He\u2019s a drug addict and there\u2019s no way to know for sure that he wouldn\u2019t steal your money. NTA", "NTA. There are reasons why everyone else in the family is keeping a distance. They probably got burned too many tkmes. He's pulling the family card on you and being manipulative. \n\nAlso, nobody gets banned for what he's telling you. If it's just a matter of proving his identity, why doesn't he just do that? It's more likely that he got involved with something shady, or maybe he owes money so he wants to avoid having it in his name. If you get involved you may find yourself accused of being an accomplice.", "He can go to a check cashing place. NTA", "The second I read substance abuse issues, this whole thing became clear. Former addict here. We're hands down, the most convincing liars, while in the midst of our addictions, and master manipulators you'll ever meet. \n\nFor that reason, and that he was bad enough to get kicked out of his home, should make you wary of his story.  \n\nThis whole bank account fraud thing isn't bc he didn't show his identity properly, banks don't claim fraud and close accounts for that.  But they do claim fraud for actual fraudulent activity... 10 to one, I bet he could have tried check or credit card kiting and got caught. \n\nNo, NTA. Do not let him deposit paychecks or any other funds into your account.  First of all, he won't be able to unless you put him on your account as a 50/50 partner. If he hasn't mentioned this to you, it's bc he wants to it come up later after you say yes, at a time when it's too late for you to feel comfortable about backing out. \n\nSecond of all, there is no way to know for sure what fraud he's done or if he might be eventually charged with something. You also risk him depositing cash that might be from an illegal source, and depositing it into your account makes you complicit in whatever he's involved in.  \n\nAll of that and even more can happen with the unknown of someone with a substance abuse problem. Red flag that he doesn't even want to involve his friends, but he's OK with putting you at risk? No, tell him no and refuse to budge. The whole is shady and stinks.", "NTA. You could just say you can deposit his paychecks and give him the cash once it clears the bank. Other than that, I wouldn't do anything else. \n\nIt seems very scretchy that he cannot open his own account and he admits his friends cannot help him as it would meds up thier finances. Seems he's cool with messing up YOUR finances for some reason though...", "NTA. Not your job to keep enabling him in general. He can get paper checks or figure out his finances without you having to get involved.", "NTA, I recommend to keep finances away, can't he open another bank account and close it when he doesn't need it anymore?

A man could quite literally beat and abuse a woman, never give her back her account so she cannot leave and control everything. A man should never do this. I\u2019ve had money, trust, love and a family dream stolen from me by someone I was in love with. All that saved me was having my own bank account and the money inside of it. I would of loved to have raised my child surrounded by love, empathy, compassion with mum and dad living together in love showing our child the morals and ethics to be a good person. When that person left, they took everything they could get their hands on. My only advice would be, you never know how vicious the person you love will act when or if unfortunately a relationship breaks down and in that moment when your world is burning down, ashes upon your tongue, you will thank the gods for your saving account and that they cannot touch your income. It\u2019s a hard lesson to learn, it is like a seatbelt. You wear it always and hope you\u2019ll never need it.", "I'm truly sorry you had to endure all of that. \n\nYou're right; \"you never know how vicious the person you love will act when or if unfortunately a relationship breaks down.\"\n\nLove is a fickle, tricky bitch, and holds the potential to unleash the worst parts of people. \n\nFar too many people believe that love is a feeling and that when the feeling fades, it's time to hightail it out the door and off to find the next person who gives us that feeling. \n\nIn the process, many people will do absolutely stupefying shit that is so heinous and vicious, you aren't sure who the fuck they really are anymore....or if you ever did to begin with. \n\nPeel away all the bullshit and nonsense about what love is or isn't and one definitive answer remains: love is a decision. \n\nA conscious decision to be the best partner to your partner, day in and day out. Deciding every day that you are going do the best you can to strengthen and fortify your relationship, to create happiness, inspiration, trust, safety, and  peace within your union. \n\nYet we don't do that and shit gets gnarly. \n\nThe love feeling inevitably goes away, we don't have enough insight to realize feelings ebb and flow and the feeling of being in love will return if we stick around long enough to let it return, while making sure to cherish our partners and the relationship.\n\nAnyhow, that guy was an absolute dick. Yes, absolutely, I am so so glad you disallowed him access to your bank account. From what you described, he undoubtedly would have cleaned it out on his way out, and do it again with another woman one day.\n\nThank you for the insight. I'm mulling it over in my head still. \n\nIn any event, I am truly sorry for what you went through and I am glad you made it through that hellish experience."]}
