She\u2019s receiving chemotherapy and as far as I know, it\u2019s not terminal. \n\nOne of Olivia\u2019s dreams in life is to get married. Ever since I\u2019ve known her, she\u2019s talked about her future wedding and has planned every last detail. Since she got diagnosed, she\u2019s become very worried that she won\u2019t be able to have her dream wedding because she might pass before that happens. Based on what I know about her diagnosis, she\u2019ll likely survive and go on to live a full life, but it\u2019s a definite possibility she could die. \n\nPeter and I are currently in the wedding planning stage, and this is also where we might be the assholes. Peter\u2019s parents approached us a few days ago and asked if we would be willing to dedicate some of our wedding time to Olivia since she might not get one of her own. According to them, Olivia wants to wear a wedding dress, invite a lot of her friends, have a say in the food/cake/decorations, and have a first dance with her boyfriend. They said it\u2019s better to do all this at me and Peter\u2019s wedding because then the family can celebrate all together. \n\nPeter and I were shocked that they would ask this since we thought that our wedding would be about us. I know Olivia is struggling and I feel completely awful for her since no teenager should have their youth ruined by cancer, but I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t have a separate party for Olivia instead of having to dedicate half our day to her. Especially since she would likely get most of the attention due to her condition. Additionally, it would cost a lot more money to have to pay for Olivia\u2019s friends to attend the wedding (Peter\u2019s parents only offered to pay for 75% of the additional cost) and Peter and I aren\u2019t made of money. \n\nPeter and I told Peter\u2019s parents we would think about it, but after discussing it, we decided it would be better to say no because we\u2019d prefer our day to be about us, but we\u2019d be more than willing to pitch in funds and help plan a separate party for Olivia. But when we informed Peter\u2019s parents, they were furious. They said they couldn\u2019t believe we were prioritizing ourselves over a child with cancer and that we were being selfish. They said this might be Olivia\u2019s only chance for a wedding and how dare we deny her \u201cdying wish.\u201d I said I didn\u2019t understand why we couldn\u2019t have a separate party, but Peter\u2019s parents said they wanted it to feel \u201cauthentic\u201d for Olivia, so it would be better to do it at an actual wedding. \n\nWhen they started raising their voices, Peter and I left. But since then Peter\u2019s family has been spamming us with messages about how terrible we\u2019re being to Olivia and how they can\u2019t believe we\u2019re not being considerate of her wishes. \n\nPeter and I both frequent this sub, so we wanted to know what the Internet thinks.

Olivia is 15. Does she not understand that people don't get married and wear wedding dresses at other people's weddings? \n\nIs she really pushing for this to happen at your wedding, and if so, does she dislike you? \n\nOr is it possible her mom just doesn't want to spend money on a party for Olivia and is lying when she says Olivia really wants this to happen at your wedding?\n\nHas Olivia's mom generally dealt with Olivia's illness in a really \"normal\" way or has she been overly attention-seeking and Munchausen-y about it? \n\nIs it possible that her mom is driving the narrative for the fake wedding because it brings attention to herself?", "NTA. This request is way out of line and is frankly quite creepy.  They want to piggyback off your wedding to throw a fantasy party for a teen?? \n\nYour wedding is *your* wedding and you should stick to your plan.  Don\u2019t accept any funds from them as there will no doubt be strings attached. \n\nThe suggestion that they (not you) throw her a separate party is the one to go with (if at all). That ball should stay in their court though. \n\nSeriously: consider eloping. I don\u2019t trust his parents to not try to spin your wedding into her fantasy wedding. (She might just show up in a white dress too. )\n\nThey have clearly lost all perspective at this point. Consider a Vegas elopement!\n\nEdit to add that a wedding is \u2018authentic\u2019 if there\u2019s an exchange of vows between two legal adults officiated by a JP/priest/minister or other party licensed to conduct weddings.  The reception following is a party, not a wedding.", "NTA\n\nHonestly I find the whole thing kind of repulsive. A fake wedding for a maybe dying child is maudlin and in very poor taste. \n\nWearing a wedding dress is not a wedding. Cutting a cake is not a wedding. Having a first dance is not a wedding. A wedding is a sacred commitment, including God or not, between two people who want to spend their lives together. This is nothing but a farce.\n\nTell her the truth. She will live, she will be fine, she will go out with a million frogs way before she ever finds her prince, and when she's ready she will have her wedding.", "NTA. This is such a weird take for your in-laws to have that I can only imagine it\u2019s the emotional panic of the idea there daughter could die that has them thinking this is even remotely okay. It\u2019s your wedding. It\u2019s supposed to be about you. I wonder if they are worried that Olivia going to your wedding is going to make her depressed and this is their weird way of offsetting that. \n\nIt would make way way more sense for them to do all these wedding-type things for Olivia\u2019s sweet sixteen (obviously I have no idea how close that date is and I mean cancer can upend the best of plans at any time).", "NTA. Having a separate party for Olivia is reasonable and the attention would be all on her at her own party. Your wedding should be about you and your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA\n\nA separate party would be the best solution for everyone, even for Olivia.\n\nI think your in laws are being the selfish ones, since they probably know it will be easier and cheaper (for them) to let Olivia and her friends \"tag along\" in your wedding.", "This crazier than a sack full of squirrels.  NTA", "NTA \n\nLooking at this in the best light for them, they\u2019re in a state of anticipatory grief and are fixated on something they can do or for something else to be angry at.\n\nAs blunt as it sounds: Your wedding isn\u2019t a suitable place for a make a wish style deal and it\u2019s completely reasonable to say no", "NTA.

It's understandable that they're worried about Olivia, but that doesn't mean you should have to give up your special day.

Don't. Yeah, it's sad. But doesn't give anyone the right to take your day away from you. \n\nYou did offer a reasonable compromise. If her parents are so worried about her wishes, they should do a wedding-like party for her. All relatives who do care about her and her friends will be able to attend or make time to attend, right?  Asking you to compromise your wedding is not okay.", "NTA\n\nA way better option would be to make a separate party for her, so that she can get the full attention then. I bet she would feel awful when she'd realize that this idea of theirs is causing such unnecessary stress for you, who should also be celebrating.\n\nAdditionally, who decided that everything should be celebrated all at once? Every time there's a reason, you should celebrate. \n\nLastly, it would be morbid on so many levels to larp a wedding for a 15 year old, especially with the backdrop that she's getting treated for a possibly fatal condition. So she has a boyfriend, and at that age I'd be dreading a giant party with strangers, focused on me having my first relationship, with intimacy, presenting as husband and a wife, in someone else's wedding. It's strange, off-putting and out of order in so many levels that I can't even try and comprehend this. It's an unnecessary \"shotgun wedding\" for two children, one of whom might die. If she doesn't, they've \"gotten married\" in front of families. How do you dial down or walk away from that if feelings cool down?", ">(Peter\u2019s parents only offered to pay for 75% of the additional cost) \n\nNTA - They are off their rockers.

And she\u2019ll get to have entire day in it and the whole party will be for her, much better than sabotaging your wedding", "NTA but I think you\u2019ll have to give up on your idea of a wedding until she\u2019s better, unless you want to cut them all off (I assume you don\u2019t, at this point). \n\nThere\u2019s likely to be no good solution to this very weird request / expectation other than taking your wedding day completely off the table. \n\nMaybe have a small wedding vows / elopement with a few friends, and do the big party on your 5 or 10 year anniversary. That is becoming more common anyway these days, with people choosing to save up for house deposits etc when they\u2019re younger.", "NTA. I am imagining being a guest at the wedding the way they\u2019re proposing it and being super confused about what I was there to celebrate. Utterly bizarre request of them.", "NTA. Just... Wow.  Yes - a wedding isn't the same as a party - it's the start of a marriage. It really sounds Olivia only cares about the party side. Valid - she's only 15. She shouldn't be concerned about getting married right now.  It's her parents reaction I'm struggling to understand.  Ideally - this is also YOUR \"only chance at a wedding\" or do they not care about that?", "What in the Holy Freak Show are they thinking? This is such a repulsive idea, I am horrified. Why on earth are they not focusing on positive thoughts and forward thinking instead of death and morbidity?  This is crazy town 101.  Please do not allow these people to take over your wedding day. The two of you don't deserve such a morbid mess.", "NTA. Of course you're not being selfish or unreasonable. Even if you did what they wanted, it's not a \"wedding\" for her, and who knows if her boyfriend, or her boyfriend's parents, would be OK with it anyway? It's creepy and weird. She's 15, how about they throw her a quincea\u00f1era, or a sweet sixteen if she's near sixteen. I don't know if you guys are Hispanic, but you could take inspiration from a quincea\u00f1era, which does have a role for the boyfriend. She could have a white dress, cake, etc etc. And it's not weird and creepy. Also it allows you and your fiance to have your own wedding day, as you deserve. You're right, if you did it, you'd be an also-ran at your own wedding.", "I think the parents want to make her a party (this part is ok specially when it is known that being happy is good for the immune system) to have her fulfil her wedding fantasy (why not after all) but they don't want to spend too much money and/or to organize it so they want to highjack OP's wedding (and that is not an ok thing!).", "> They want to piggyback off your wedding to throw a fantasy party for a teen??\n\nIt's cheaper.", "Jeezus, when the kid does get married can OP get half of SILs wedding to get their kids baptized? Or renewal of their vows? Like WT actual F??", "Honestly, why can't the kid have an over-the-top wedding themed birthday? Or have one after she beats the cancer diagnosis? Sounds like Peter's parents have a favorite, and it isn't Peter.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking too. Peter and I have refrained from talking a lot about our wedding around Olivia at Peter\u2019s parents request because they don\u2019t want her to be more sad than she already is.", "Shouldn't that be *nuttier* than a sack full of squirrels?\n\nIt's still a funny expression though. Also NTA.", "I hope your daughter is doing well and pulls through!", "Nope", "I wonder if the parents will respond to OP's s refusal by holding Olivia's party the day before, you know, \"because everyone's in town.\"", "Especially with Olivia's parents not paying for all additional costs...\n\nNTA, OP. You and Peter celebrate your wedding as you wish, not as Olivia wants to!", "It's also creepy as fuck. It smacks of those \"purity vow\" weddings where little girls promise their virginity to their own fathers \ud83e\udd2e", "25% cheaper apparently", "Totally, although I can't imagine any combination of events that would freak me out this much. As a guest I would be horrified.", "NTA could you find a way for either you or Peter to chat with her and see what she really wants herself?  If she's a bridesmaid she could have some extra pictures taken of her and her parents perhaps. Or she could surprise you and say that whilst she's sad she might not live to be married she didn't actually want a fake wedding and all the pity that would come with it. \n Her genuine bucket list may surprise everyone but mostly they all need to be focusing on the positives, she is very likely to come through this! So take it bit by bit and have her nails done. Get a nice wig or hair appointment whatever is appropriate for her, have her make up done for the wedding, but being a child bride isn't okay. She's not 5 pretending with daddy (which is gross anyway to me) she's 15 and knows it's weird", "Whoa. No, it's nothing like that. What is the matter with you?", "Yeah really what the heck.. I mean I\u2019d be *very* uncomfortable as a guest if this happened, but there are no incest vibes here. Nasty."]}
