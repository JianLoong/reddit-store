She\u2019s receiving chemotherapy and as far as I know, it\u2019s not terminal. \n\nOne of Olivia\u2019s dreams in life is to get married. Ever since I\u2019ve known her, she\u2019s talked about her future wedding and has planned every last detail. Since she got diagnosed, she\u2019s become very worried that she won\u2019t be able to have her dream wedding because she might pass before that happens. Based on what I know about her diagnosis, she\u2019ll likely survive and go on to live a full life, but it\u2019s a definite possibility she could die. \n\nPeter and I are currently in the wedding planning stage, and this is also where we might be the assholes. Peter\u2019s parents approached us a few days ago and asked if we would be willing to dedicate some of our wedding time to Olivia since she might not get one of her own. According to them, Olivia wants to wear a wedding dress, invite a lot of her friends, have a say in the food/cake/decorations, and have a first dance with her boyfriend. They said it\u2019s better to do all this at me and Peter\u2019s wedding because then the family can celebrate all together. \n\nPeter and I were shocked that they would ask this since we thought that our wedding would be about us. I know Olivia is struggling and I feel completely awful for her since no teenager should have their youth ruined by cancer, but I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t have a separate party for Olivia instead of having to dedicate half our day to her. Especially since she would likely get most of the attention due to her condition. Additionally, it would cost a lot more money to have to pay for Olivia\u2019s friends to attend the wedding (Peter\u2019s parents only offered to pay for 75% of the additional cost) and Peter and I aren\u2019t made of money. \n\nPeter and I told Peter\u2019s parents we would think about it, but after discussing it, we decided it would be better to say no because we\u2019d prefer our day to be about us, but we\u2019d be more than willing to pitch in funds and help plan a separate party for Olivia. But when we informed Peter\u2019s parents, they were furious. They said they couldn\u2019t believe we were prioritizing ourselves over a child with cancer and that we were being selfish. They said this might be Olivia\u2019s only chance for a wedding and how dare we deny her \u201cdying wish.\u201d I said I didn\u2019t understand why we couldn\u2019t have a separate party, but Peter\u2019s parents said they wanted it to feel \u201cauthentic\u201d for Olivia, so it would be better to do it at an actual wedding. \n\nWhen they started raising their voices, Peter and I left. But since then Peter\u2019s family has been spamming us with messages about how terrible we\u2019re being to Olivia and how they can\u2019t believe we\u2019re not being considerate of her wishes. \n\nPeter and I both frequent this sub, so we wanted to know what the Internet thinks.

Olivia is 15. Does she not understand that people don't get married and wear wedding dresses at other people's weddings? \n\nIs she really pushing for this to happen at your wedding, and if so, does she dislike you? \n\nOr is it possible her mom just doesn't want to spend money on a party for Olivia and is lying when she says Olivia really wants this to happen at your wedding?\n\nHas Olivia's mom generally dealt with Olivia's illness in a really \"normal\" way or has she been overly attention-seeking and Munchausen-y about it? \n\nIs it possible that her mom is driving the narrative for the fake wedding because it brings attention to herself?", "NTA. This request is way out of line and is frankly quite creepy.  They want to piggyback off your wedding to throw a fantasy party for a teen?? \n\nYour wedding is *your* wedding and you should stick to your plan.  Don\u2019t accept any funds from them as there will no doubt be strings attached. \n\nThe suggestion that they (not you) throw her a separate party is the one to go with (if at all). That ball should stay in their court though. \n\nSeriously: consider eloping. I don\u2019t trust his parents to not try to spin your wedding into her fantasy wedding. (She might just show up in a white dress too. )\n\nThey have clearly lost all perspective at this point. Consider a Vegas elopement!\n\nEdit to add that a wedding is \u2018authentic\u2019 if there\u2019s an exchange of vows between two legal adults officiated by a JP/priest/minister or other party licensed to conduct weddings.  The reception following is a party, not a wedding.", "NTA\n\nHonestly I find the whole thing kind of repulsive. A fake wedding for a maybe dying child is maudlin and in very poor taste. \n\nWearing a wedding dress is not a wedding. Cutting a cake is not a wedding. Having a first dance is not a wedding. A wedding is a sacred commitment, including God or not, between two people who want to spend their lives together. This is nothing but a farce.\n\nTell her the truth. She will live, she will be fine, she will go out with a million frogs way before she ever finds her prince, and when she's ready she will have her wedding.", "NTA. This is such a weird take for your in-laws to have that I can only imagine it\u2019s the emotional panic of the idea there daughter could die that has them thinking this is even remotely okay. It\u2019s your wedding. It\u2019s supposed to be about you. I wonder if they are worried that Olivia going to your wedding is going to make her depressed and this is their weird way of offsetting that. \n\nIt would make way way more sense for them to do all these wedding-type things for Olivia\u2019s sweet sixteen (obviously I have no idea how close that date is and I mean cancer can upend the best of plans at any time).", "NTA. Having a separate party for Olivia is reasonable and the attention would be all on her at her own party. Your wedding should be about you and your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA\n\nA separate party would be the best solution for everyone, even for Olivia.\n\nI think your in laws are being the selfish ones, since they probably know it will be easier and cheaper (for them) to let Olivia and her friends \"tag along\" in your wedding.", "This crazier than a sack full of squirrels.  NTA", "NTA \n\nLooking at this in the best light for them, they\u2019re in a state of anticipatory grief and are fixated on something they can do or for something else to be angry at.\n\nAs blunt as it sounds: Your wedding isn\u2019t a suitable place for a make a wish style deal and it\u2019s completely reasonable to say no", "NTA.

Right?", "NTA.  Your wedding should be about the 2 of you.  Her parents should have a seperate party for the daughter.  Maybe a sweet 16 party??", "NTA. Their request is insane. It's understandable that they're worried about Olivia, but that doesn't mean you should have to give up your special day.

Throwing a separate party for her though is a beautiful thought and takes nothing away from your special day.", "NTA you bring up good points and it would most likely ruin your wedding deepening on how people act as most people probably would focus more on her than you guys.", "NTA.  I'd be thinking about eloping now, because even if stop asking for this, you know they're going to plan something behind your back & hijack part of your day.", "NTA. \n\nIt's very easy to get caught up in \"it's the poor girl's wish\". Don't. Yeah, it's sad. But doesn't give anyone the right to take your day away from you. \n\nYou did offer a reasonable compromise. If her parents are so worried about her wishes, they should do a wedding-like party for her. All relatives who do care about her and her friends will be able to attend or make time to attend, right?  Asking you to compromise your wedding is not okay.", "NTA\n\nA way better option would be to make a separate party for her, so that she can get the full attention then. I bet she would feel awful when she'd realize that this idea of theirs is causing such unnecessary stress for you, who should also be celebrating.\n\nAdditionally, who decided that everything should be celebrated all at once? Every time there's a reason, you should celebrate. \n\nLastly, it would be morbid on so many levels to larp a wedding for a 15 year old, especially with the backdrop that she's getting treated for a possibly fatal condition. So she has a boyfriend, and at that age I'd be dreading a giant party with strangers, focused on me having my first relationship, with intimacy, presenting as husband and a wife, in someone else's wedding. It's strange, off-putting and out of order in so many levels that I can't even try and comprehend this. It's an unnecessary \"shotgun wedding\" for two children, one of whom might die. If she doesn't, they've \"gotten married\" in front of families. How do you dial down or walk away from that if feelings cool down?", ">(Peter\u2019s parents only offered to pay for 75% of the additional cost) \n\nNTA - They are off their rockers.

The two of you don't deserve such a morbid mess.", "NTA. Of course you're not being selfish or unreasonable. Even if you did what they wanted, it's not a \"wedding\" for her, and who knows if her boyfriend, or her boyfriend's parents, would be OK with it anyway? It's creepy and weird. She's 15, how about they throw her a quincea\u00f1era, or a sweet sixteen if she's near sixteen. I don't know if you guys are Hispanic, but you could take inspiration from a quincea\u00f1era, which does have a role for the boyfriend. She could have a white dress, cake, etc etc. And it's not weird and creepy. Also it allows you and your fiance to have your own wedding day, as you deserve. You're right, if you did it, you'd be an also-ran at your own wedding.", "I think the parents want to make her a party (this part is ok specially when it is known that being happy is good for the immune system) to have her fulfil her wedding fantasy (why not after all) but they don't want to spend too much money and/or to organize it so they want to highjack OP's wedding (and that is not an ok thing!).", "> They want to piggyback off your wedding to throw a fantasy party for a teen??\n\nIt's cheaper.", "Jeezus, when the kid does get married can OP get half of SILs wedding to get their kids baptized?

So take it bit by bit and have her nails done. Get a nice wig or hair appointment whatever is appropriate for her, have her make up done for the wedding, but being a child bride isn't okay.

I don't see why they can't have a separate party for her either if it means that much to them and their maybe dying child. \nThis is your and Peter's day to celebrate your relationship. Not a bandwagon party that starts off as your wedding and finishes as the maybe dying child's \"dying wish.\" That's not fair to you guys and the work you've put into your relationship over the years to get to this point of getting married and having a ceremony.

If you hold firm on your no, as you should, they may retaliate at your wedding or refuse to go in protest. Celebrate your day, your way.

Anything less will be interpreted as acquiescing to their request.

It doesn\u2019t have to be far - even a beautiful spot a few hours drive and stay at nice cabins or have everyone go in on a a place by the beach and you and your fianc\u00e9 get your place.

They can apply to make a wish or similar organizations. The criteria is that the child have a life threatening condition, it does not need to be terminal. This would be a much better idea for her. She can have a day that is over the top and all about her. Plus, vendors may be willing to donate for that cause.", "Munchausen by matrimony.", "I don't think the parents are handling this great, I'm not backing their play. But I also don't think this is evidence that Olivia is their favorite child. Maybe if Olivia was fine and Peter was unexpectedly potentially dying of Cancer the parents would be rallying around him and whatever he said he wanted out of fear and guilt? This is not a situation where both kids are in an equal situation, at all. \n\nMy guess from this post is that the parents just can't afford to throw a real seeming wedding party themselves, which is why they can only afford to pay 75% of the extra cost. And the extra cost of adding people to a venue and catering is much much less then renting the venue, paying the entire catering, paying for all the flowers and decorations, music etc. Plus, this is just the extra cost of her friends dinners alone they can't afford to cover, not even counting all the family. \n\nMaybe the parents are just really upset that they are unable to give their potentially dying child the one thing she is telling them she wants before she maybe dies? And they saw OP and Peter as a way to do that, and thought Peter would help. Now they think they're going to let her down and they feel like faliures.\n\nAnyway, I have a lot of empathy for everyone in this story beacuse having cancer as a teen is super hard, your child having cancer is super hard, and the ask to OP and Peter is really a lot. But I think we should recognize how hard this is emotionally on all parties and maybe have some sympathy for them in how harshly we see them as people.
