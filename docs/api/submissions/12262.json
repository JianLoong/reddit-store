You should probably make sure you are comfortable with your beverage or snack or choice.\n\nLet\u2019s begin, shall we?\n\nYou insulted your *dying* friend. I\u2019m sorry, *best friend*. I do not want to know how you would treat a \u201cregular\u201d friend.\n\nYou put a security deposit on a breed of dog that you have always wanted, which is great, congratulations. But, this breed of dog are usually smarter than their owners, and require *a lot* of training, as does *any* puppy or dog. Puppies shit in the house. They piss in the house. They tear things up. They whine. They bark. They chase butterflies, leaves, squirrels, bunny rabbits, pretty much anything that moves. They are extremely inconvenient, albeit cute, for about the *first two years of their lives*. And they have the attention span of a toddler while your are teaching them the appropriate times and place for those activities.\n\nAlright. Now that we got that out of the way, you could have approached that subject 10,000 different ways - none of them include insulting your *best friend who is dying*.

I\u2019m not equipped to handle two dogs and my security deposit is non-refundable (they usually are unless you have an extenuating circumstance like your *best friend* dying), I would be happy to help you find him another home though where you can be confident he will be happy and well taken care of\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of cleaning my cats litter box, but I do it anyways without insulting them because I *care* about them.

Nearly every time a dog is poorly behaved, it's the owner's fault for not training him.  That is probably what happened here.\n\nIf you don't **want** his dog, you shouldn't take him.  As you know, having a pet is a **lifetime** commitment.  Also, if your best friend is dying of cancer **why in the hell does he care how much money it costs**?\n\nAs long as you help him find a good home for his dog, which you said you'll do, you're firmly not the AH.

But so are German Shepherds just BTW.\n\n German Shepherds require real consistent training and simulation. and yeah, prepare to fork out for at least a gastropexy and maybe some arthritis treatment and training classes. \n\nI think NTA because your friend just sprung this on you. You probably could have said it better than just that Horace is not a good dog, but perhaps you were surprised.", "Soft YTA- As someone who has had a GS and currently a currently a two time pug owner with a litter I can say it is all about the training. My shepherd tore my leather couch, ate my shoes, tore the curtains, jumped and ripped my shirt and pants and ran off with socks and when you went to get them back ran like he had the IRS chasing him for back taxes and that was with training. My pugs sleep in bed with us, go outside to poo and pee, play with their squeaky toys, and just love to cuddle. After taking my GS to the vet for his shots at four months old and having to wait in the car as he tried to fight every damn dog in the office and eat the cats I realized something was wrong. My boy was raised with cats and other dogsI have trained dogs for years and he would not stop. After he attacked the neighbors dog for no good reason I realized he needed to be in the country with a good family. I made a few calls and put him with a great family and he is currently happy living in the county. My pugs have NEVER attacked anyone and are the sweetest babies around. BEFORE anyone calls me a backyard breeder or a puppy mill my babies had went to the vet the same day they connected for a nail trim. My girl had a silent heat and that was the first time I had ever seen one in my 50 years. Beware of vet bills as GS can tear a muscle jumping! When that happens you\u2019d better have cash in savings or a CC with some money on it! Research the breed before you jump in and get one! The shelter is full of those puppies that everyone wanted and didn\u2019t research/couldn\u2019t handle or afford! That being said you didn\u2019t agree to take Horace and your friend shouldn\u2019t have assumed.", "NTA. Don't get why everyone is saying YTA. It's your money, your house, your time. Spend it however you will. \n\nGet the dog you want. A puppy is easier to train than an adult dog.", "NTA for not wanting to take your dying friends dog in, but jeez why'd you come at the poor dog like that? I get that him shitting everywhere is a big issue, but its definitely not his fault. And if you think the GSD puppy wont tear up your house, you're in for an expensive surprise cause that puppy will turn out exactly like the pug if you dont make efforts to train it. Humongous effort.", "NTA as your under no obligation to take on your friend ill trained dig, but a German shepherd puppy will absolutely require alot of attention and will destroy shit till trained", "Well he is YTA but not because he wouldn't take Horace.  He could have eased his friends mind and then done what needed to be after the fact.\n\nHowever that doesn't mean he doesn't understand what he is getting in his new puppy. A puppy will potty in the house and destroy things, however when properly trained which takes awhile those behaviors stop.\n\nI believe his issue with Horace besides being a breed that isn't compatible with his lifestyle is that the dog hasn't been even basically trained (still pottying in the house) I mean I love dogs and have 4 both big and small and I absolutely would not take in a dog that is passed the puppy stage and has not been at least basically trained.", "YTA for blatant shit posting", "Soft YTA, I knew it was a surprise but I would tell my friend that I will adopt Horace and then try to give Horace a new home later. I know that lying is bad, but I would rather let my friend be happy in his final moments", "NTA. And he shouldn't want you -who explicitly says you don't like his dog- to be the one \"caring\" for it. There are plenty of pug lovers out there; it should be possible to find a good home for Horace.", "NTA and your friend is. He might be dying of cancer but that's no reason for you to take on a crappy dog. Go for what you want and look after the puppy. The last thing you need is having to put up with a bad dog and never bonding resulting in both the dog and you having a miserable life.", "You delivery was AHish, somewhat comical, and inconsiderate. YTA. If this is how you treat your best friend dying of cancer. You should focus on developing more empathy, compassion, and emotional intelligence in general.", "NAH. You're allowed to want whatever dog you want. People on here saying, \"You should've given this perfect, diplomatic answer!\" are sitting behind their phones with as much time in the world as they want to come up with a response, not being blindsided by a dying friend. Your friend is also concerned about what will happen to his dog. He wasn't graceful in his approach, but... You know, he's dying. I'm willing to cut him some slack.", "YTA if this is real. Not sure if you've owned dogs before, but GSDs also shit, and sometimes it happens in the house! Shocker, I know. You're not obligated to take Horace (although he sounds like a sweetheart who just needs some guidance), but YTA for your long attempt at \"clever insults\" for a breed you don't like and for buying from a breeder. What might have brought your friend joy would be knowing Horace would be taken care of, not seeing a photo of your pricey future dog.", "Soft YTA. If you really believe a German Shepherd puppy will not exhibit everything you say Horace does you\u2019re sorely mistaken. Whether or not you want Horace you say this is your \u201cbest\u201d friend which I don\u2019t believe for a second. Your friend was also TA for just assuming you would take Horace. Also Horace is two and is still technically a puppy, did you consider maybe he didn\u2019t have the best training because your friend was sick when he got him? You never mention it here but yeah as the owner of a German Shepherd you\u2019re in for a rude awakening if you think it\u2019s going to be easy. Also depending on the breeder you chose your puppy could be riddled with health defects that are so commonly found in German Shepherds. Mine is a rescue but even I know she wasn\u2019t bred well/something isn\u2019t quite right with her.", "YTA\n\nNot for saying no.  But not for even looking into a rescue.  Lots of breeds in rescue.  And might have gotten a full grown dog who didn't pee on the floor", "NTA - if you're not comfortable taking in his dog, you shouldn't feel forced to. And surely your friend would have others he could ask. In the worst case scenario, surely he could sell the dog & make sure he goes to a good home.", "NTA for not taking the dog, but the way you talk about the dog is kinda gross.", "Yta\n\n\nFor not liking pugs. They are the sweetest dogs. Honestly, it sounds like your friend hasn't had time to train Horace. \n\n\nAlso, you have no idea what you're getting when a puppy comes home. \n\nI hope you read up on German Shepard because they have their own set of issues\n\n\nI think your reasoning is ridiculous.  I hope Horace finds a wonderful home.", "NTA. Taking on a puppy is a MASSIVE responsibility and not to be taken lightly. Your friend is being an AH expecting to just dump him on you. You have to pay a dog loads of attention, feed them, exercise them, train them, and play with them everyday for 15+ years - not to mention making arrangements around where you can live and when you go away. Your friend shouldn't expect you to make such a huge commitment when you've already offered to help rehome him.", "NTA. I had to go back and look but \n\n>You\u2019ve known Horace since he was a puppy. \u201c\n\nHe's two. He is *still in the puppy phases.* And no one in their right mind would accept a dog they don't like.", "YTA \nEven if we take away the whole part of your friend dying and you not taking his dog, you\u2019re buying a puppy from a breeder instead of adopting a dog which immediately makes you an AH.

So yea, you don't like the breed. Can you at least be honest and admit that's the ONLY reason why? I think everyone here can admit that all animals can be retrained with hard work (which apparently you don't wanna put in, which is also ok).

It's your right not to take in that dog but I honestly cannot fathom what possessed you to tell him it's a bad dog. Couldn't you have just said that you'd paid a deposit or something?

When a friend is dying, you step up.

It is possible to have and train two dogs, but even if you cannot then you do for your friend . When my mother died, I saw to the rehoming of three of her four dogs. My sister adopted the fourth. The one she adopted was untrained, and she really did not like her. But, she felt she owed it to my mother to keep this dog and she did. They made a happy home for 6 years until the dog died.
