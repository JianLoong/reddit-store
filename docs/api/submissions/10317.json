Thankfully, my father (m52) and mother (f52) are very supportive and my mother has been cooking with more meats, seafood, and legumes, while my father has agreed to buy me protein powder. I hold responsibility for the rest of my food intake, as well as supplements like creatine and preworkout.\n\nI have very little food restrictions, but one thing I really despise is pork. Unfortunately, my family does not share this taste with me and we eat pork often as a result.\n\nMy breakfast meals usually have around 50-70g of protein (depends on the day) and it is usually a ham and cheese sandwich. As I already mentioned, I eat specifically chicken breast as ham as it is not only edible for me, but also healthier since I am trying a clean bulk diet.\n\nMy sister (f21) who is not at all disciplined with her food has eaten several of my high protein meals that usually I purchased. This specific problem arose as I found out my sister has been eating my chicken breast instead of the regular pork ham my mother purchases for my younger brother\u2019s (m16) school lunch. There usually is a lot of that type of ham as she buys it from Costco.\n\nI eventually stopped trying to convince my sister to stop eating my chicken breast ham and started buying turkey breast ham instead. My sister has a very rare but mild allergy to turkey meat so I figured she would absolutely not be eating that. I unfortunately forgot to inform her of my recent meal prep modification, and turkey meat looks quite similar to chicken meat, so she had a swollen face on a day where she was supposed to go on a date.\n\nMy sister accused me of sabotaging her chances with \u201cprince charming\u201d and later escalated to even accusing me of trying to kill her. I told her that I did not mean for her to eat the turkey, but she should have listened to me from the beginning and not eat the food I buy for myself as a dietary plan, and not primarily for enjoyment.
