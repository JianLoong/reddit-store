If you don't want to have anything to do with them, just talk with them and explain what you feel and what you want. It's not your fault to be in this situation, but also not your stepsiblings. Both of the parties are the victims, so the least you can do to get it over with is to have a conversation and be done with all this. She wants answers that you have and you deny it to her, so she pushes more to get them. Your mother is the real AH for everyone of you.", "NAH. Your mother is straight out of the novel I read before.", "I am going to play devils advocate here and just tell you that your mother has probably not changed in the time you had been no contact and the step sister is right that her brother and her deserved better. No they are not your siblings by blood or relationship but your mother was made part of their lives very young and I am sure has had some negative impact on their lives just like yours. I might be wrong but this sounded like a very unskilled attempt to ask for help from someone who might understand the hell growing up with that woman in their life. NTA, but you seem to forget that they grew up with her as a mother too and could probably use some emotional support from someone who understands.", "NTA, but have you considered WHY she's reaching out to you?", "She probably grew up watching your sister being supported by her big brother and expecting the same thing, your mom and her dad probably made her think it too. I understand that you were going to move out soon anyway but if your stepsis was old enough to remember you not wanting a relationship with her, that probably doesn\u2019t look good from her pov either.\n\nShe grew up being told that you were her brother by her family then suddenly you say she isn\u2019t (even though you never said it yourself)\n\nI don\u2019t know if your sister had a relationship with her but she lived with them longer than you did so stepsis probably also saw her as a sister. So what she\u2019s seeing is her older brother letting her sister live with him, walking her down the isle, but her being disowned.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't have to house a stranger for an entire summer. However, instead of telling her that you wouldn't do it, because she is not your sister, maybe you should've told her that you are busy.", "Why does your step-sister, who only knew you for 2 years 15 years ago, think of you as her brother?", "NTA - might be a tad bit harsh; but NTA.\nShe\u2019s not your sister and there\u2019s no such thing as a step sister, mother, father or whatever. Everyone either has a biological relationship to someone or they don\u2019t. The Westernized concept of \u201cstep\u201d anyone is strange because people know they\u2019re not family but still pretend.", "ESH - None of this is your stepsister's fault, and you should have been more sensitive to her feelings. She was a child, and she's obviously hurt that you aren't close to her. I get that you resent your mom, but in no way is that ever a child's fault.\n\nShe's also being an asshole by demanding that she can live with you as a college aged young adult. But, she's young, she's curious, and she's angry. She's also obviously traumatized, and you just fed into that. You blocking her when you're in your thirties is childish and dismissive. \n\nTraumatizing someone else because you were traumatized is never the answer.", "Sounds like you're taking out your disgust for your mother on your stepsister.\n \nYou can have anyone in your life and home that you choose, but it seems like you've focused your cross hairs on the wrong enemy.\n \nChances are your stepsister grew up under the same tyrrany you did and is looking for connection. \n \nYou don't have to host her, but what could a conversation hurt? She's not the one who ruined your childhood.", "Yta. Not because she can't live with you. But i think you are mean to her. You're mad at your mom. They did nothing to you.\n\nShe doesn't have to live with you. But you can be nicer", "Yes", "YTA\n\nA child wanted your help and you rejected her. You may not be blood related but you\u2019re more than strangers. You\u2019ve turned into your mother.", "[deleted]", "YTA. \n\nI typically make it a point for every one of these posts. Kids are not responsible for the actions of parents.\n\nYou decided to cut this kid out for literally no reason. She was enduring the same mother you did. She probably hoped to bond with you over the fact that your mom sucks ass. \n\nIt's too late now methinks. Your step sister probably thinks you are truly your mother's son, genetically and personality-wise.", "YTA\n\nWhen an 18 year old reaches out to you like that they could very well be trying to escape a bad situation.  Being a decent human being requires you to at least hear them out.  You don\u2019t have to agree or feel responsible, but a hard no to even talking makes you solidly the selfish asshole.", "NTA. You never asked for them to be apart of your life and neither did your sister. Bottom line is family is who you choose. The only thing I would say is if your mum was this bad to you and your sister, your step siblings may also be receiving the same treatment, and from that point she may be reaching out for some form of help to escape from that. But that does not excuse her from forcing a relationship upon you. It is your decision at the end of the who you form relationships with, no one is allowed to force relationships on one another. Just make sure it\u2019s not a cry for help before cutting her off completely", "Wow definitely NTA as expected. Why is this step sister you barely no so desperate to get close to you? Sounds like she\u2019s equally disappointed in her family upbringing and wants nothing to do with them. No excuse to project that onto you.", "NTA. I think you'd be a bit of an A if you did have some form of relationship with your stepsis, but by your own admission, you haven't said a word to her in 14 YEARS. That's most of her life you haven't had any form of relationship with her. You last saw her when she was 4, she's basically a stranger to you.\n\nYour stepsis is just a minor A I think, not too much. It was a bit much to insist you let her stay after the first refusal.", "NTA she's not your sister and I understand your need to get some distance from your mother and her band of flying monkeys.", "NTA.\n\nYou handled that very well. She has no right to waylay you and start in with her entitled, needy demands. The mother probably sees that you are successful and told this girl to move in with you in hopes of getting you to pay for her college.\n\nBut you were mistaken to have any convo with her at all. Why was she at the local mall? Waiting there day after day in hopes of confronting you? What could possibly be gained by your telling her what your position is? It's a waste of time. She wants what she wants and she doesn't care what you want. Her mother is pressuring her to get money from you, and she is told not to fail.\n\nI'm afraid you haven't heard the last of these appalling people.", "Oh, that\u2019s rough. Poor girl is trying to escape too. But, NTA. You simply have no obligation to her.", "NTA but not a great person.", "NTA as you don\u2019t owe her this, but have you considered that your mum might have used the same parenting approach with the step kids as she did with you and your sister, and they might be just as much victims in all this?\n\nShe might need someone to talk to. Maybe she wanted to confide in you. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to help her, but if she was ready to cause a scene in public perhaps she\u2019s had a hard time of it too. \n\nDo you have any reason to believe that you and your bio sister were the only ones affected by your mum\u2019s approach?", "May be an unpopular opinion but I lean towards YTA.\n\nYou certainly have no obligation to your step-sister that you barely know and have no solid relationship with.  However, it sounds like you didn't even try to build a relationship with your step-siblings due to your estranged relationship with your mother. Those two were kids who probably lived under the same rules and life you experienced with your mother and instead of being a supporting sibling, you chose to ignore them while your sister has had your support all of her life. Those two kids grew up to 8 and 10 with your sister and you as an estranged step-brother.  You let your relationship with your mother affect your potential relationship with 2 innocent kids.  \n\nYou also chose not to hear out your step-sister and flat out told her No. If there was history, I could understand.  But for someone who wants to build a relationship and may need actual support for the summer, have the decency to at least hear her out.", "This. Considering the relationship with her biological children, stepsibling may be looking for a way out too.\n\nNothing wrong with stepsister asking but she does need to take no for an answer. It would be nice if OP wanted to build a relationship but you don't owe contact (or free rent) to anyone - family or not. \n\nNTA", "He was only in the house for 2 years.", "Just a guess, but she thinks her parents are awful as well, has seen OP being the model of a decent human being and is trying to gain his advice in her attempt to leave the parents.\n\nCould be wild speculation, but hey; that\u2019s Reddit!", "It is your decision at the end of the who you form relationships with, no one is allowed to force relationships on one another.", "I mean she could've politely asked why you didn't want to talk instead of going on complaining about how it's unfair. But I'm guessing that it's the parents who told her that she can expect the same kind of treatment as your sister.", "Orrrr she grew up in the same poisonous household as OP and needs someone to confide in.", "Yeah, OP isn't an asshole, but I am concerned about what the stepsister is experiencing. She lived with this person for 2 years when she was a toddler, never saw them again, and now 14 years later she wants to move into their house. That screams \"Desperately trying to escape a bad situation.\"\n\nI mean, maybe she's just a dead ass weirdo, but I'd put money on a bad home life that she's struggling to escape.", "#10/10", "Couldn\u2019t agree more", "She was told no multiple times before ambushing him at the mall. Pretty sure she deserves harsh. No one is owed a talk.", "My best guess is she wants a relationship and for me to be her brother given what she said about it not being fair that my sister has that. She could also want to bond over the shitty person my mother is.", "She was newly turned 4 when I last lived there so I'm not sure she would remember me. Maybe vaguely but I was hardly around her anyway so I'm not sure if she would or not.\n\nMy sister does not have a relationship with them and never wanted a sibling relationship with them either. Even when she lived with them and I had moved out she considered me her only sibling and never referred to them with the sibling titles.", "Why lie?", "Stepsister is an adult. She can be told the truth. She may be a \"stepsister,\" but in reality is little more than a stranger to OP. It's okay to be straightforward with people.", "Op told her no multiple times. She's college age and old enough to understand what no means, but continued to push. Regardless of age, her trauma is her responsibility, not OPs. And who's to say that by opening a relationship with her, it's not also allowing more contact with ops mom, causing them further trauma? He stated his boundary and doesn't actually owe her an explanation.", "I don't think it's her fault. She's just some random stranger to me and was insisting on living with me. I don't want contact with her. We did not have any in the last 14 years. I don't want any now.", "She's a stranger to me and a stranger who thinks I should be her big brother and let her live with me. I am not her brother, I'm not even her family. A conversation after 14 years is not something I care to have.", "I agree that they did nothing to me.", "What a cruel, unnecessary comment at the end that isn't even true. OP basically states that her stepsister, who is 18 and an adult, is a stranger to them because they haven't been in their life for over a decade.\n\nNTA", "We are strangers. I had not seen her in 13 years and it would have been 14 if it hadn't been for my sister's wedding.", "Just playing devil's advocate here, how do you know her intentions or whether she's experienced the same as he has growing up? She isn't his mother's child and we don't know if she still has a mother or other boundaries established. \n\nHe met her at 2 years old (from the age gaps in his post), he was around her until she was 4 and he was 18. Their total relationship was 2 years (in which she was extremely young and he says he made no effort with her) and he has had zero contact (from his comments) in 14 years. \n\nIf I was the 18yo in this situation, he would absolutely be a stranger to me at this point. She also only reached out to him to stay at his home and \"bond\" but didn't reach out to his sister who is also an adult and supposedly spent more time around her (until she was at least 10) to ask for \"help\".\n\nI definitely think bare minimum he could have entertained a conversation to find out more but its unfair to say a \"child\" reached out and wanted his help. She is the exact same age he was when he was essentially forced out of his home.", "I honestly don\u2019t know how she could be hurt or how OP is a jerk - they were NC for the last 14 years. That\u2019s not a lot of memory she might have of him. She\u2019s also not a child, she\u2019s a young adult who should understand that she can\u2019t force it on OP if OP doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her. It\u2019s not like they spent a childhood together and OP suddenly claimed that she wasn\u2019t his sister. \n\nNTA.", "There was a good reason, because they're a stranger imposing on boundaries and trying to force a relationship, that's enough of a hassle in my book to not bother with them.", "It wasn't for no reason. We are not family and were not related so no reason to build a relationship when I knew I would become estranged from my mother.", ">Your step-siblings are growing up with the same mother you had to, so they might be experiencing some of the same problems and are reaching out because they need help in getting away. You're not obliged to, but finding out why they want to move away as well could be telling.\n\nso, he was also kid, she has already graduated school", "Then she should have said that. But regardless its not OP job to house a stranger. Why wouldn't you open your home then.", "You're not obligated to her in any way. You also did her a favor by not skirting the issue. She's not your sister. There's a huge age gap, you clearly never bonded with her.", "My thoughts exactly.", "So she's basically a stranger. Sounds like your mother has been feeding her lies.", "NTA\u2026 you have no obligations to her or her brother. They were imposed on you by your mother and if you don\u2019t want a relationship with them.  Seems step-sister got jealous of all the support you gave your sister and want the same.  But feels like she got an idea in her mind rather than sibling bonding, mayb she wants the way you financially supported ur sister.\n\nI had imagine if ur mother had a child with their dad then the situation would be different cause than child would be blood related.", "It looks like you mother has been \"feeding\" this strange family concepts on her! The girl practically never met you, so where the hell comes this?? If your stepsister continues to stalk you, just tell her that you will make a formal complaint about her harassment, and to please transmit that info to her/your \"lovely\" mother!", "Newly turned four means you have been her brother for as long as she can remember but you never wanted a relationship with her. You look like a really bad person from her side.", "Because if she is very young, saying stuff like \"you are not my real sister\" can cause trauma and will likely alienate OP's stepsister.", "I wouldn\u2019t want a random stranger in my house either. Good for you OP for standing up for yourself. NTA. Your stepsister is not entitled to a relationship, especially not after gatecrashing your sister\u2019s wedding.\n\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t think this ask came out of the blue. Your mom likely told her she could to stay with you, or is forcing her out. Frankly, your sister should make like you and block them both.", "You've had zero contact with her for 14 years? Why does she think you've got a relationship?", "It wouldn't really change anything for me. We'd be blood related but I would not be willing to be connected to my mother again for the sake of another kid she had. It was different with my sister because we were close and she was someone I had spent time in the same home as, and both of us lost our dad. She was also old enough for me to keep in touch with and not need contact with my mother.", "But she didn't see me at all in the time after that. Until the wedding. I was not in her every day life. I wasn't even someone they saw once a year.", "Sounds like OP hasn't spoken to any of the family except his bio sis in 14 years. I fail to understand why the stepsister would be surprised that he doesn't consider them a sister?", "He doesn\u2019t consider her as family so what alienation is there?", "I don't agree, she has to suck it up and deal with her circumstances. Being lied to is more traumatic than hearing the hard truth.", "Yeah it\u2019s fair for you not to what to do anything with your mother which is reasonable. It was more an assumption that if you had a blood half-sibling your reaction would be different.", "She's probably jealous and wants a big brother. Maybe she was fed lies by her parents.\n\n I think NTA because she caused a scene, but honestly if you didn't see her at all after 4, I don't understand how she expected anything? You're a stranger to her at this point.", "Wow. The only explanation is that your mom talked about you like everyday if she got the bro/sis idea", "She also grew up with the same mom you did. She\u2019s likely just as desperate for someone to help her get out if there. Not saying you should or need to, but it may play a part."]}
