We\u2019ve kept in contact over the years, so that the girls can see each other, which has been difficult because Wendy has been trying to guilt us into financing Sarah\u2019s life since she is Elena\u2019s sister.

She said she is pregnant and since she already has 3 other kids, we need to take custody of Sarah. She said she is struggling to manage Sarah\u2019s needs (Sarah has some learning delays and some behavioural issues) and she is at the end of her rope. She said she and her husband are on the brink of divorce over this. \n\nMy husband and I said no.

I\u2019ve also been bombarded by messages from their extended family as well calling us all sorts of names. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to take in a child unless you are sure it\u2019s something you want to do wholeheartedly, and this isn\u2019t. But at the same time, not taking Sarah in might mean Elena ultimately loses contact with her and Erin\u2019s family because whether she remains living with Wendy or not, I can\u2019t see continuing a relationship with Wendy after this. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s right to just take a child like they\u2019re a piece of luggage to be traded when you\u2019re not sure.

Its so easy for everyone else to point fingers yet none of them are stepping up. Terrible situation all around but its not YOUR burden to carry. NTA", "NTA Wendy has already taken Sarah into her family. She is now trying to force the obligation onto you when she had already long taken the duty onto herself. That was wonderful of her to do, but it came with duty of crafting her life thereafter around having to care for and raise Sarah. This she has failed to do.\n\nThe duty was never yours. She took in her sister's child and you took in your bother's. She is just desperately hoping that a bombardment of guilt-tripping and undeserved blame will overwhelm you into accepting the duty she chose to take on as if it were somehow always meant to be yours.\n\nAny decision you make should not be based on her (and her flying monkeys) gaslighting you into thinking that the duty she took on is really yours.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nWendy knew she had to take care of Sarah when she got pregnant again. It's not like this is a new thing exactly. If you aren't 100% committed to a child, you shouldn't feel forced to take them in.", "NTA.  That\u2019s her child, and she committed to her.  But it\u2019s not clear what the alternatives really are.\n\nIf this is US or similar: \n\nShe can\u2019t just \u2018put\u2019 Sarah in foster care. It doesn\u2019t work like that.  A caseworker would look to provide supports and look for resources within the family, but if they adopted or accepted permanent legal guardianship this is a serious thing.  You\u2019re right - kids aren\u2019t just redistributed casually without consequences.\n\nDoes she need respite from you or her extended family? If it\u2019s kinship foster does she need funding from the state to keep the family intact? \n\nAITA has an awful lot of \u2018AITA for not taking someone else\u2019s kid/my kid\u2019s sibling?\u2019 for the level of complexity.  That\u2019s very sad. \n\nIt is really really challenging to disrupt, to disrupt age order in the new placement etc - and whatever you do, there are other ways of supporting.", ">About a month ago, I got a call from Wendy. She said she is pregnant and since she already has 3 other kids, we need to take custody of Sarah. She said she is struggling to manage Sarah\u2019s needs (Sarah has some learning delays and some behavioural issues) and she is at the end of her rope. She said she and her husband are on the brink of divorce over this.\n\nI have two thoughts on this.\n\nFirst, if you're at your ropes end dealing with one of your children, why would you get pregnant?\n\nSecond, I'm wondering if they got pregnant and figured they could use it as an excuse to dump her on you?\n\nNTA", "OMG NTA. My mother took in two of our cousins after they had been bounced around much extended family. She passed them on too. They were little at the time. They did not do well in life, as you can imagine. Why can't the extended family take her in?", "Info: was there a will or guardianship arrangements set up for the girls should anything happen to their parents? Or was this an agreed upon arrangement at the time? Is there any other family in the picture?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Wendy bombarded us with messages saying she will put Sarah in foster care, because if she doesn\u2019t her kids won\u2019t have a father anymore, blaming me for ruining Sarah\u2019s life\" ..

What does SHE want? \n\n* If she has no opinion yet, you might need to block all of them on HER devices and get a restraining order to protect HER from these AHs. THey might try to gilt her to get at you.\n* IF she HAS an opinion, you should include THAT in your decission.", "NTA\n\nObviously they are TAs", "NTA - You are in a impossible situation . You have done all you can . There choices are there own. If they put her into Foster care this is tragic but NOT ON YOU.  Do not let them guilt trip you into a bad decisions. Taking the child out of guilt will not foster a great relationship for either of you.", "NTA. It's not going to do Sarah any good being taken in by people who don't want her. You are not related to her anyway. If no one from their family can take her then she's better off in foster care.", "Why doesn't the extended family that is bombarding you with messages take her in?", "NTA. You said it yourself, you shouldn't take a kid in unless you're doing it wholeheartedly, and in this situation, it wouldn't be on your part. You can respond to Wendy's family by simply asking them back \"I can't take her in my current situation, and it would strain the relationship with my husband, but would you like to take her in?\" Easy way to guilt trip them back and play the victim too, two can play the same game. \n\nWendy is bluffing. She's not putting her late sister's kid up for adoption.", "What does it say about a person who is trying to 'pawn off' a child when they already have 3-children and just announced they're pregnant with yet another?  Sadly...it sounds almost as if the pregnancy was planned as an excuse to get rid of Sarah.", "NTA.\n\nNot your child, not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\n this is for Wendy to sort out. You have said no. Stick to it.", "NTA. \n\nTaking her in would be an amazing gift to her and Elena, but you have no moral duty to do so. You have to decide what\u2019s best for your family, including what you can handle and what you want to handle. You can make the choice not to take Sarah without guilt or shame.\n\nIf Wendy and her husband need more help managing Sarah\u2019s needs, there are likely social service agencies that can provide help. \n\nWendy is being an asshole to her child and to you, her husband is being an asshole to her child and to Wendy and their relatives are being assholes to Sarah and to you. \n\nY W B T A if you sever your daughter\u2019s relationship with her sister over this, though. Maybe you could suggest DFS (or the equivalent in your country) look at permanency options for Sarah in your community so she can be adopted locally, making it easier to maintain that relationship.", "EAH for separating two young children, especially after a tragedy of losing both parents. You never made a comment about financial strain on your part, only that you dont \u201cwant\u201d to take in the other girl. Obviously implying because shes not related by blood. Thats cold hearted. \n\nIn fact, Wendy is the least of an asshole out of all the adults in this situation. Shes under a lot of financial, emotional, and physical stress and still trying to make the RIGHT decision. But woah is you for having to think about raising a little girl who isnt biologically related. Cry me a river and do better.", "Wendy didn\u2019t adopt her she just has guardianship. I think she gets a stipend from the state and that would stop of she legally adopted Sarah. I don\u2019t know this for sure but she was always very vague and defensive when asked why she didn\u2019t adopt her and people told me that may be the reason. \n\nI don\u2019t know how foster care works but I always understood they can\u2019t make you keep a child if you don\u2019t want to. Hopefully they would be able to work something out.", "If the aunt, Wendy, never adopted or had legal guardianship of  Sarah, Wendy can call the proper authorities and that will be the end of it.", "My brother indicated that should anything happen, he wanted us to take Elena. This was when she was born. He specified that with his lawyer at the time. \n\nI never knew what arrangements were made for Sarah since she was Erin\u2019s child but Wendy was the person contacted for custody of Sarah so I presume that was a pre-agreed arrangement as well since Sarah\u2019s dad was not in the picture. \n\nIf you mean Erin\u2019s family being in the picture, there aren\u2019t other siblings. Their mother lives in a retirement community due to health issues. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s other family willing to take Sarah, based on what Wendy has said.", "We haven\u2019t asked Elena. As much as we try to give her a voice, she\u2019s six years old. Last month she asked if we could bring her mini donkey (my parents have a menagerie of animals) to live with us in our apartment. Practicality is not in her thought process yet. If we thought we were going to take Sarah, we would consult her, but I don\u2019t see the merit in consulting her on something we already feel isn\u2019t an option for us.", "I hope Wendy is bluffing but if I\u2019m honest, having known her for years, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable betting on that.", "I would never want to sever the relationship but I\u2019m aware that\u2019s not entirely my choice. Wendy has always made some pretty uncomfortable comments to both girls about them living separately which we\u2019ve had to deal with. After this I\u2019m worried it will become increasingly hostile. And if Sarah doesn\u2019t end up elsewhere keeping a relationship will be the decision of her foster family. \n\nWe\u2019re committed to maintaining the relationship but it\u2019s not all our choice.", "i would agree the extended family are being Assholes as they could step in if there so upset.\n\nBoggles me that  they are attempting to but this all on OP\n\ni disagree OP would be  Y W B T A  as if the adoption takes the child across the country that is not down to OP.", "She can negotiate for the stipend to continue in many states if that is an impediment to permanency by adoption or permanent legal guardianship.\n\nBut it sounds like she did not want or intend to make it permanent.  \u2018Going into the system\u2019 is a threat to you but could bring them resources to stabilize or another resource family.  This poor child.", "In my state in the US someone has to have legal guardianship (\u2018meds and eds\u2019) at the least.  I can\u2019t imagine that being different anywhere in the US. Minors have someone with guardianship.", "Well, if she does, she'll be the black sheep of the family. You can then proceed to adopt her the proper way with the right paperwork if you choose to.", "I have never had a Dr office ask for proof of legal guardianship.  Not unheard of for people to lie.   But you are right, if aunt has legal guardianship, Wendy will have to file with the court.  But if she says she cannot handle the kid, kid is likely to end up in foster system.", "The foster system will reach out to everyone they know first.  Including OP and OPs family to ask if they are a resource bc they will be named by Wendy as possible resource and parenting sibling.  They will also be asked to consider respite to keep the family in tact. \n\nWhen the parent takes the kid to doctor, school, puts them on forms, deducts them on taxes \u2026 you\u2019re saying you are authorized to make decisions for them.  You may not have recognized it as such?  In any case she did assume guardianship and would be undoing it.", "Not unheard of for people to either lie or not understand that they are not a LEGAL guardian.   Does happen with stepparents, who do not understand that in many states they have no legal rights.  \n\nFoster system can reach out, but they cannot force OP, her family or anyone else to take the kid."]}
