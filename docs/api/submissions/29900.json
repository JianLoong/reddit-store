But if she says she cannot handle the kid, kid is likely to end up in foster system.", "The foster system will reach out to everyone they know first.

They seem to be demanding more from you then her actual biological family. \n\nNta", "Former SPED teacher here! \nTaking in a child with special needs, even \u2018minor\u2019 issues like Sarah has, is a HUGE commitment and you should NOT take her without understanding exactly what will be required for her care and how it will effect your entire family, which it sounds like you have and you are making the best decision for your family. Also, in my personal experience:\n\n-if Wendy has not adopted Sarah but only has a long term foster or temporary guardianship than Sarah still has a caseworker who SHOULD be checking in on Sarah and providing resources for the family\n\n-You should speak with this caseworker and let them know that while you are unable to foster Sarah, you would like to stay in contact with her and they will tell the new foster parents, which every foster parent I have worked with has been willing to do\n\n-While at some point in the future Elena may be upset by having less contact with her sister, it is MORE LIKELY that if Sarah came to live with you Elena would become angry and resentful of all your time and energy that Sarah would take away from her, as well as suddenly having to share everything\n\n-Most foster/adopt agencies resist or outright refuse to allow a placement where the foster child is older than all the other children in the family. It really messes with family dynamics and has a history of not turning out well\n\n-Wendy sounds like one of those people who only foster for the money and has now realized that it\u2019s more work than she wants to put in. Sarah probably does not have a great home life and might be better in a different placement anyway. FAMILY IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST OPTION\n\nNTA and unless those other family members are willing to do something about the situation they can STFU", "NTA all of Erin's family can take her in, or they can look up her paternal side.

I cannot imagine doing to a child what Wendy is suggesting. You are NTA no matter what you decide to do about this. However, you may want to start seriously considering what you'll do if Wendy goes through with placing Sarah back into the system. What a sad situation... I'm sorry OP.", "NTA \n\nWho are these people that think others have some sort of responsibility to raise a child unrelated to them??\n\nI feel bad for the kid, but she's her neice, not yours. You are raising your neice. If her aunt couldn't handle another kid with the neice, why did she get pregnant? Cuz she assumed you would take the physical, emotional and finacial responsibility of her neice?? \n\nJust sorry, no", "NTA\n\nIf Wendy's extended family feels so strongly about Sarah's welfare, then why don't any of them step up to take her in?", "NTA\n\nThe extended family should take her. She is not even your niece....", "Why do these people think that it\u2019s an easy decision to take in any child? \n\nYou already took in one child and nobody has asked you whether the shake up to your lives was a burden, just like Sarah is to the sister. Yet because you did it once, the sister expects you to be open to another? No. \n\nNTA- for putting your own family above other\u2019s.", "NTA - her relatives who are harassing you can take her in - she is not related to you", "NTA. \n\nThe question is: What are the alternatives? Tbh. I don't think that Sarah should stay with her aunt because even if she doesn't put her into foster care Sarah will always be the unwanted child and they will make her feel it. \n\nAlso don't give to much about Wendys extended family calling you an asshole. That's only natural because they all are the likely candidates to be asked to take Sarah in. Anyone of them calling you an asshole is just stating that they don't want to take responsibility either - hence being an asshole themselves.\n\nDid your brother even adopt Sarah?", "NTA. Not even close to your responsibility. By the amount of flying monkeys involved here there\u2019s plenty of family around. They can take her.", "NTA. Sound like Wendy realized that Sarah has a lot of issues that won\u2019t allow her to be parentified and be used as a 2nd mom with the arrival of a new baby so she is trying to pawn her off. Anytime someone asks why you aren\u2019t taking the child in respond with \u201cI\u2019m so glad you care so much that you will be taking the child in so they don\u2019t go into foster care. Bless you.\u201d Flip the script on them, if they care so much they must care enough to take the child in. Sorry this is happening to you, protect your family and your peace.", "So it\u2019s ok for them to give up on her when things get hard but it\u2019s not ok for you to know your limitations as parents when you are already caring for a child. And where are these other relatives that are blowing up your phone??? Why aren\u2019t they taking the girl in if they feel so strongly about it? Why does it need to be you and your husband? NTA", "SO NTA! The fact that Wendy CHOSE to have another kid when she was overwhelmed already is a HER problem. She should've never taken on the responsibility of raising her niece if it wasn't going to be for life.  \nAnd if no one else is willing to step up and do what's right, they are ALL AH  and they deserve nothing but the worse!", "I have a daughter I adopted from foster care. When her gave birth again when she was about 4, they asked me to take her in. It was the hardest decision I ever made to say no but ultimately the right decision for all of us. \nYou have to do what's right for your family. NTA", "NTA. Even if there was a way for Wendy to give up her parental rights to Sarah, it would not bode well with CPS. A mother who gives up one of her children will be under scrutiny for her ability to care for her other children, including her unborn child.", "That poor girl. You're NTA, but that poor girl.", "So she is considering putting a child that has lived under her roof for 4 years, but YOU are the one that will ruin the child's life? \n\nThe fact that there is a blood bond between the two girls and the fact that you are being emotionally blackmailed doesn't mean you are obligated to take in a child.  \n\nIf you were planning on adopting another child,  then you could consider her,  but at the end of the day,  NTA.\n\nKeep to the facts when dealing with this family.", "Poor Sarah. Nobody wants her. NTA for refusing to take her, but it is still sad.", "NTA", "NTA. There are actual family members that could take her into their home. Do not let them guilt you into something that you don\u2019t want to do.", "NTA good on you for being aware of your limitations. It\u2019s not fair for anyone to guilt you into being responsible for another human and while everyone would end up together in a world where there are always happy endings, if the timing isn\u2019t right then it isn\u2019t right.", "NTA if so many of her extended family are texting you, suggest one of them take her in. As unfortunate as this is, it is not your responsibility.", "NTA", "The extended family is crazy why aren\u2019t they blaming Wendy for dumping the poor child? You are entirely correct. You must be physically and emotionally ready  to take in another child and you are not. This is not your guilt to carry,", "Perhaps those who are offended by you not taking Sarah should take her in themselves.", "NTA. Do not be emotionally blackmailed. If Wendy does not want her then she should have gone to her wider extended family and also Erin's paternal relatives (if they have ever availed themselves). They have no right to bully you into taking a child who is not your relative. It is interesting that  Erin's  maternal relatives are putting their energy into harrassing but do not want to step up to the plate. These people are hypocrites and are therefore projecting on you - they don't care about this child, especially one with learning difficulties. \n\nI know it is a worry the sisters may not see each otjet years, if ever again. But it may be worth seeing if a child who goes into the foster care system are still allowed to have contact with relatives.\n\nWhatever happens Erin's family are the cruel people not you and your husband, who have made efforts to keep the sisters' relationship going. You may have to have a conversation with Elena at some point in the future", "NTA", "How is any of this your responsibility in her eyes?  Your brother had a daughter you adopted. She took her sisters daughter. You and your brother have no connection to her. However, Wendy and her family have connection and responsibility for Erin\u2019s daughter and they call you names for their lack of love for their niece, granddaughter to give her a home. They are shameful. I feel sorry for Sarah. (where\u2019s her dad?) No one EVER should feel unwanted and unloved.", "NTA But any time any of HER family try to guilt you, turn it back on her. Wendy has been Sarah's mom for 4 years and is going to throw her out like trash. That is unforgivable. And if social services reaches out to you, you can explain you cannot take her but since she is your daughter's half sister you would like for them to be able to keep in contact", "NTA: I'd be very wary of letting your daughter have any unsupervised contact with the extended family as she gets older. If they're already trying to load the blame onto you for Wendy's decisions, then imagine what they'll say to Elena about it all", "NTA\n\nSounds harsh, but this isn't your problem. This is Erin's family's problem. \n\nYou adopted Elena because she is your brother's daughter.\n\nI get they want the half sisters to remain in contact, but this is something HER family needs to figure out, not yours.", "The extended family can take the girl in. Social services might not even consider you as you're not a relative. Taking in one child is difficult and not something everyone should do. Taking in any isn't something that should be forced or done out of guilt. Nta", "NTA. You said no and that is your choice. I\u2019m sure if she goes into foster care, they will let her sister see her.", "NTA - the child, Sarah, has no relationship to you except as the half sister of your adopted daughter, Elena, who was taken in by her aunt Wendy. Now Wendy is finding it difficult to continue raising this child and wants to ditch her off onto you and has been able to garner sympathy from her relatives blaming you for everything. WHAT is the matter with these people???  All these people, all these relatives of this little girl are so busy expending all this energy finding an outsider to blame . . .  Total nonsense. Elena is only 6 and she doesn't need to stay closely connected to her half sister. There is absolutely no reason why you are to blame for any of this. You don't need the added burden. Focus on your own family and stay away from these idiots.", "Why is no one else in thier extended family stepping up and taking in Sarah?

She may very well be overwhelming; Wendy's still a gigantic, gaping AH irrespective, but you don't know the extent of Sarah's issues. Even a child without those issues can find it very hard to adjust to a new living situation. But with Sarah, you'd need to find her therapists, a school that could cater for her needs, and you'd have to help her adjust to a new home. You'd have to put a lot of time and energy into providing for her needs, quite likely to the detriment of Elena who would be confused and upset that there was a new person in the house taking up your attention. If Sarah began acting out, there'd then be more issues that you'd have to work on. \n\nYou're exactly right: you can't just see how it goes. If you make this commitment, it's has to be permanent. You know your situation and what you can handle, and if you don't feel equipped to look after Sarah, that is perfectly fine. Even if it's a case of not wanting another child, that's fine, too. You should not be pressured into having a child you don't want and/or aren't able to care for in the way that they need.

My family had a similar situation, and the younger generations once adults (aunts uncles) were pretty critical of the older ones (grandparent generation) for having not kept their siblings together. I think the reason for resentment was that the parents had made the decision at least ostensibly on the basis of the kids, a.k.a. it is better for kids Aand B if we don\u2019t spread resources to kid C. But Kids A and B came to really resent that the decision has been made as if on their account. In your case, if it is primarily a marriage tension issue, then I would just be very honest about that with your daughter. Just tell her upfront from the very beginning that your marriage couldn\u2019t handle taking on another kid, so there\u2019s no sense in which she grows up thinking that her sister went into foster care because of her. That\u2019s too much guilt for a child/teen /adult reflecting back on it.

I presume it\u2019s because Sarah wasn\u2019t my brother\u2019s child, and as I said I didn\u2019t know Erin well at the time and she may have made the arrangements for Sarah when Sarah was born. I really don\u2019t know the answer to this though. \n\nI was never asked by anyone to take Sarah at that time. Wendy was the first person contacted as next of kin and she said she would take Sarah. Due to there being legal documents from my brother with Erin as a witness saying they wanted Elena with us, we were granted custody and adopted her.", "That's awesome you've done that. Not everyone is you. Not everyone can handle that and step up to be a loving and caring foster parent. This isn't a \"you don't owe anyone anything\" it's a OP already feels like they wouldn't be a good parent for her.", "You can hardly say OP has acted as though she did not owe anyone anything. She adopted her brother's kids and got her tubes tied to dedicate herself to Elena. She has been subsidizing Sarah, who is NOT her blood relative. Easy for people to abuse people who are generous into demanding more and more.\n\nOP does not owe it to anyone to turn her home into an orphanage.\n\nAnd, BTW, they are HALF sisters who did not grow up together.", "No he's not. The child RELATED to the husband is with them the half sibling from a previous relationship of the husband s brother gf is with her aunt ( the gf sister)\n\nRead the post again.\n\nAlso I didn't say op shouldn't take the child who is half sibling to her niece ( if she's  able to) I just pointed out  they ( op +hubby ) aren't blood related to the other child the aunt is pushing them to support and to adopt - which makes the aunt even more of an entitled ah as SHE HERSELF is the girl's blood related aunt\n\nI commend op for doing everything she can to keep the siblings relationship going I'm not campaigning in any way shape or form that just due to genetics op  should forget the other child.", "You are NTA and you have every right to protect your family and do what YOU think is in the best interest of it. You are not Sarah's blood family and you have done enough.\n\nDon't listen to people who want to volunteer your resources and efforts to others because they think you should be a do gooder and sacrifice your own family.", "Yes I mean financial means, because unless you're psychopaths who would hurt Sarah, you have greater emotional means than she would ever receive in foster care where she is far more likely to be physically and sexually abused. \n\nI think you have the enormous potential to really save this child's life and forever alter the trajectory of her life for the better. She's really alone OP and could use an adult to love and protect her.", "I\u2019m sorry but this is wild. Did no one think to consult with a child psychologist or social worker about what is best for the siblings long term?  Did no one consider that separating siblings after they are orphaned is maybe a bad idea? And now you think it\u2019s a-okay to have her sister go into foster care and never see her. Please do better by your niece, and realize that she is not going to look at this like the people of Reddit and say \u201cwell she wasn\u2019t related to my aunt who adopted me so it\u2019s totally fine that I was separated from my sister and have no chance of having a normal healthy relationship with her now\u201d. Please consider consulting with professionals about how to best support Elena long term.", "How nice of you to volunteer someone else's services for a child that has blood relatives. OP has explained that it is not in the best interest of her family and that is good enough. Elena is young and in therapy. Disrupting OP's family is not what she wants to do.\n\nNTA OP.", "You're looking at this with rose-coloured glasses. Your thinking is that if OP takes in Sarah, Sarah's life will improve, everything will be fine, and everyone will have a happily ever after. This is the thinking that leads people to adopt kids with delays or behavioural issues, thinking that all they need is love and everything will be perfect. \n\nThat thinking is wrong. The reality is that even foster or adopted children who don't have learning delays or behavioural issues can really struggle and need a lot of support to process and heal from the trauma of losing their parents or being given up or taken away. \n\nWhen a child has delays and behavioural problems as Sarah does, it adds even more support that the child needs, and if you aren't fully prepared for that and aren't financially, emotionally, and mentally prepared for that, both the foster/adoptive parents and the child will suffer. Then, if there are other kids in the house, adding a new child with extra needs causes more upheaval for them. Those kids need extra support to adjust to their new normal. \n\nAdoption and fostering aren't magic adventures where you step in and save a child with love. It is work, and I say this as someone who wants to adopt. Having biological children is work anyway, but those kids at least start with a grounding of knowing that they are loved and wanted. Older adopted or foster kids come into the situation knowing they've been given or taken away once, or having lost one set of parents already, and have that insecurity for a while that the same thing will happen all over again. It takes work just to get them to feel settled and to earn their trust, and then you have to help guide them through their feelings towards their biological parents and all they've been through. \n\nFrankly, your attitude that OP not taking in Sarah makes her a psychopath who is hurting Sarah is wildly offensive. You're asking OP to take in a child she may well not be emotionally or mentally able to care for and to upend hers, her husband's, and Elena's lives because you think it will end happily ever after; you are saying that OP should jeopardise the stability of her existing family and potentially sacrifice Elena's happiness and wellbeing for the sake of Sarah because you think it'll work out fine. It's the same attitude as those who think people should take on the responsibility of disabled relatives because putting them in a care facility would be cruel and risk them being abused. It's asking people to sacrifice their own happiness, mental health, and wellbeing because you think it is the morally right thing to do. \n\nYou're so fixated on what might be best for Sarah that you aren't giving a damn about if that decision would be good for OP, her husband, or Elena. And you're not considering that Sarah getting moved to another new home with a new children, new adults, and new rules will not help with any behavioural issues. She likely will act out, and that may well be detrimental to Elena as well as OP and her husband. It boils down to you asking OP to prioritise a child she barely knows over her existing family in the blind hope that OP's love can fix Sarah's life and make it all better again.", "Elena has seen a child psychologist ever two weeks since she has been living with us. So yes, we did and we do. And we will continue to do.\n\nWe as parents have an obligation to provide Elena with a stable, loving, happy home and all we are trying to do is find the best way to do that. We don\u2019t think an environment of strain and stress is how best to do so, and yes that is a balancing act with regards to Sarah being her half sister. We adore our daughter and all we want is for her to be happy. And sometimes that means making hard decisions, and we may not always get it right but we are doing our best."]}
