We live together.\n\nAbout nine months ago I picked up running as a hobby and I have since grown quite fond of it. I currently run an average of 25 miles a week. A few months ago I decided I wanted to try a 5k or 10k, and after some Google searching found a 5k in my city that looked fun. I registered for it, paid the fee, and decided to start training specifically for it.\n\nI mentioned it in passing to my girlfriend that night, and she asked if she could come too. I was psyched about the idea of running a 5k with her and said yes, but warned her that she would probably want to start training because I was going for a sub-27 minute time, which might be tough for a complete beginner.\n\nShe said she would like to train with me, which, again, sounded fun. The next morning I woke up at 5am for my run as I usually do, but my girlfriend was not up for it and told me she'd go later.\n\nThis continued for a week, and then two weeks, and finally I managed to get her up once for a run. She was miserable the entire time and I basically didn't get any exercise. \n\nLast Friday, the day before the race, I asked if she was really up for it. She insisted she was. She then told me that she would just \"skip-gallop\" it, like she used to do with her mile runs in middle school. I asked her to demonstrate what a skip-gallop was, and she showed me this bizarre side-stepping gallop, as if she had casts on her legs. I told her it seemed like a really inefficient way to run, but she insisted it always worked for her.\n\nSaturday was the day of the race and right out of the gate she utilized her skip-gallop strategy. Two minutes in I realized that she was already completely gassed. She started asking me to wait so we could walk together. I apologized, told her I loved her, and left her behind to finish the race. I ended up with a time of 26:43, beating my goal.\n\nAfter the race I tried calling her but she wouldn't pick up. When I made my way back to the car I realized she had left me. I took an Uber home, and right when I walked in the door, I was met with cry-shrieking about how I ditched her. I tried to calm her down and explain that she kind of brought it on herself but she was not interested whatsoever.\n\nYesterday she gave me the silent treatment all day.

I can't run for shit, so if I had the crazy idea to sign up for a run with my husband, who was taking it seriously and had trained when I hadn't, I would fully expect him to leave me in the dust. \n\nYou weren't being chased by hungry lions during the race. You didn't leave her to get mauled or eaten. You ran, she walked, that's it. She's a grown adult and even had a way to get home, as evidenced by her taking the car and actually being the one who did the ditching, leaving you to Uber home.\n\nShe's being an absolute child about this. I can't believe she's over 30. If it were me, I would have just enjoyed the stroll around the race I clearly wasn't fit to run, and called it a day, congratulating you on beating your time.\n\nCongratulations, by the way. Good job on beating your time!", "NTA\n\nShe chose to invite herself.  She chose to not prepare. And she chose to make a fool of herself with her crazy method of \"running\". \n\nThis is all on your GF.  I'm glad you had your phone and/or wallet and were able to get home after she abandoned you.", "NTA - skip-gallop? Had there been previous indications she was crazy?", "NTA, \n\nYou had a goal, told her well in advance. She shouldn\u2019t have ran with you, if she knew that she wasn\u2019t going to be able keep up.", "NTA\n\nShe asked to come, refused to train, knew you had a goal in mind and then still made it about herself.\n\nWhy are you with someone who acts like a child?", "NTA. Tell her to skip-gallop out of her feelings because this is her own fault. She saw the effort you put into your daily exercise. She\u2019s acting like an entitled princess. Just because you\u2019re in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean you have to wait for her. She knew she was not ready to run in a 5k.", "NTA, you warned her and spoke with her weeks ahead. But I will be honest her leaving you and that upset is a lot of red flags in my opinion.", "After doing zero training and then deciding to do some kind of weird Monty Python crazy walk schtick, she decides mid race she wants you to walk with her. Ya, no man. Had you promised from the beginning that it was just going to be a fun race where you both could go dressed as Batman and Robin, or drink shots at every kilometre marker, then you\u2019d be the asshole. But this, fuck that man. Training for your first sub-30 five k is a pretty major milestone. Tell Pouty McPouterson that this is your last race together. Maybe needlepoint or building birdhouses are more in her wheelhouse. NTA", "NTA.  Congratulations on beating your goal!", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend's behaviour is worse than a toddler's.\n\nYou made it clear that you were aiming for a sub 27 minute time, yet she expected you to ditch that goal on the day because *she* failed completely to even attempt to train for this event. How selfish of her.\n\nI think it's probably the case that she's more mad at herself, but the way she's handling this is insane and would give me serious pause. She needs to grow up and own her mistakes instead of taking her anger out out on people who are not responsible for her feelings.", "A race isn't a walk in the park. Your girlfriend is either clueless, or deliberately tried to sabotage your new hobby to ensure it (you) won't leave her behind. You need to have a serious discussion about what this was really about. NTA.", "The skipping part had me laughing hard imagine it. That\u2019s ridiculous. Obvious NTA.", "NTA - she didn't want to train at all and EXPECTED you to slow down with her and not make your goal time.  Next time don't mention her running with you at all and skip all the post race drama.", "NTA. You were up front about your goal so it's no surprise you didn't wait. Congratulations on your run!", "NTA.\n\nShe was not prepared for this event. She wanted to do some kind of clownish gait that turned out to be walking, while you were actually running.\n\nShe should have stayed home, or, if it had been an option, signed up for a one-mile jog-walk version of the event.", "NTA and no, you don\u2019t \u201cdeserve what you got\u201d \u2026 you trained, you prepared yourself, you tried to involve your girlfriend with you and then the day of she basically insults you by saying she did this little gallop skipping thing as if to say that your running hobby isn\u2019t a big deal because in high school, nearly 20 years ago, she did this gallop skipping thing to finish the mile run that was required then.\n\nNTA. She is though.", "NTA. Is your girlfriend Phoebe Buffay? It sounds like how she would run a marathon.", "NTA\nShe sucks and is acting like a child. Silent treatment? Please.", "NTA. I used to do 5k's with a partner, and he was much fitter and faster than me. I would encourage him to go for it and beat his previous time! So long as he waited for me at the finish line I was more than happy bringing up the rear. You set the expectation ahead of time as to what you wanted, your girlfriend should have understood and supported that.", "NTA. But this is a red flag. She may have wanted to join you for the run, but couldn't be bothered to do the hard work, and then wanted to mess up your PB. *Then* has a melt down at you?  If she was aligned to your psychological needs she'd be either trying hard to run or be more supportive of a hobby she doesn't share. If she can't do either, maybe time to get a fitter girlfriend.\n\nAs in athletic. I'm sure she looks perfectly adequate.", "NTA. What she tried to do was not ok. You\u2019d told her why you were doing this race, she\u2019d seen you training for it. I don\u2019t understand why she wanted to join in when she had no intention of taking it seriously. You need a talk with her about her motives here. It could be she just wanted to spend time with you and thought this could be a good way. Idk, you\u2019ll have to ask her.", "Nta; she shouldn\u2019t have gone with you if she couldn\u2019t keep up - signs were there when she wouldn\u2019t go for a run with you beforehand", "NTA. Your gf fucked around and found out.", "You deserve it.  And by it I mean a new girlfriend that won\u2019t shimmie her way into your hobbies in an effort to control you.   \n\nYou told her your goals, you gave her the opportunity to train with you, she didn\u2019t want to do it.  Seems like she just wanted to find a way to control the thing you were excited for.  She seems pretty immature and I think you could do better.", "Is she this unreasonable in other aspects of your relationship? Because this is alarming", "NTA - If she wanted you to walk next to her she should have just said that. You TOLD her you were going for sub 27 mins. Idk what she has to cry shriek about.", "NTA\n\nYou were there to run a race, and were clear about that. She didn't do any prep ahead of time and probably would have struggled to walk the whole thing even. I've been in shape and run 5ks... been out of shape and walked 5ks.  I did a turkey trot last Thanksgiving with my in-laws. My SIL is a runner, so she ran the race. My MIL and FIL are 75, so they slow walked the race. My partner and I at 39 and 40 power walked it.  None of us expected the others to slow down/speed up to accommodate us.\n\nThe ONE thing you perhaps could have done is prepare her before going to the race that if she wasn't able to keep up, you would run ahead. Just saying your time goal probably didn't click with her as most people don't understand how long it takes to walk a distance, let alone run, and usually massively over-estimate how fast they're going.\n\nAnd at the end just outright blaming her, while not technically wrong, definitely threw fuel on the fire that wasn't necessary.", "NTA......  Dude a so truly know EXACTLY what you are dealing with. My wife is the same way. I started a fitness journey several years ago because I was just out of shape dumpy. I dieted, worked hard, hit the gym daily etc... (because of my work schedule I go to the gym at 3:30 a.m. till 5:00 a.m)... I'm now in incredible shape. My wife on the otherhand is frustrated and annoyed that she's just gotten further out of shape despite the fact that I prepare healthy meals daily for us. She want to go with me to the gym, but \"it's to early, blah blah blah.....\"  I/'m not going to let her hold me back. If she wants to be resentful, that's on her.... \n\nYou did nothing wrong", "Do not continue to let this,or something like this, happen again.  You are both starting a new life together and some serious ground rules should be in place.  The first one should have been discussed with her saying she wanted to run with you and didn\u2019t.  You woke her up, she refused to go, end of her being involved.  You should not have woken her up again.  She is an adult.  She can get herself out of bed.  Now she has foolishly tried to run a race with zero practice. THEN got mad at you, a person who actually trained, because you ran your race.  Her pouting is a manipulation tool you need to NEVER try to fix.  No apology, no nothing. She is TAH.  Do not let your love for her make you give up yourself to her demands.  A good relationship is reciprocal.  You have done your part.", "NTA. I used to run a lot more than I do now, but in a race it was always kind of an unspoken agreement with my running buddies that we could all branch off as needed to reach our goals.\n\nDifferent if you were treating this as a fun run and didn't care about time, but it's your perogative to be competitive if that's what's fun for you! I guess it should have been discussed beforehand what would happen if you guys ended up splitting up? That's the only thing I can think of that may have diffused the situation a little bit, it may have made it more clear to her that you were planning on running at your own pace regardless of hers. Although it kind of sounds like she wanted you to stick by her no matter what so I don't even know how to fix it lol", "NTA", "Did you say she was 31 or 21?\nOught to be ashamed of herself.\n\nNTA and congrats on the time!\nBloody well done!", "Nta, she knew your goal and decided not to train.   Sound like she is trying to be controlling.  Think about your life with her and determine if this behavior is new,  chances not,  and determine if this is how you want to spend your life.", "NTA,I do an occasional 5k with friends, I walk, they run, we meet up at the end.", "NTA. Damn she needs to grow up!", "NTA. You beat your goal! She should be proud and happy for you. If she wanted to keep up she should\u2019ve put in the work.", "Sorry the image of her galloping is making me crease with laughter. NTA", "NTA You told her you had a goal you wanted to achieve. You tried getting her to join you in training. Ask her if she expected you to give up your goal because she didn't feel like trying?", "Nta, she seemed like she wanted to interfere with your hobby and make it a date/hang out. She needs to let you be and do your thing and not be jealous.", "NTA. I don't know why she thinks she just decide she's also running the race that you're taking seriously, not train and then expect you to ruin your chance at your goal by walking with her. It was you that signed up for this in the first place for your own goal! It would be different if you had planned to do it together from the start.", "Your GF saw this as \u201clet\u2019s have fun together\u201d thing, not a \u201cyou want to run a race\u201d thing. That\u2019s her bad because you flat out told her it was a \u201crun a race with a good time\u201d thing.

I'll walk and see you at the end! \n\nI think she really underestimates running. The importance to you and the difficulty of it in a race.", "NTA also I'm sorry but your gf sounds exhausting, entitled and annoying (from that post at least). Does not sound like a healthy partner from this post. If you're willing to put up with it, good, wish you the best tho.", "NTA", "NTA. My friend and I signed up for a year of 5ks together. We never stayed together because we did this to push ourselves, so we would spend time before and after the race but do our own thing during. I think it\u2019s dumb to expect to run next to someone the entire time anyway - you probably can\u2019t hold a conversation if you\u2019re taking it seriously. Not to mention you explained to her that you had a goal for yourself!", "No. It's a 5k. You told her that you had a time goal to beat. This was not a casual stroll together.

Congratulations on beating your goal!!", "NTA\n\n\nGood on her for showing interest in your hobbies. \nHowever, you had invited her to join you for training, and you did tell her that you're taking the run seriously. She should've stayed on the sidelines and supported you rather than stubbornly joining the run to gallop her way to the finish line. \n\n\nIf anything, she should be apologising to you, and celebrating with you for completing your goal.

Its her fault she expected anything different then what you said you would do.", "NTA\n\nI know she did this because she wanted to do something with you, which is nice in theory, but she clearly didn't really value what it was that you wanted to get out of the experience and made no effort to prepare herself for it.

She also seems really quite immature if her response is the silent treatment. \n\nYou havent done anything wrong here if anything I would say you have more right to be annoyed and upset than she does.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ditch her but she ditched you and ruined your event. Apparently, your wants aren\u2019t important - only hers which was to have a romantic walk rather than an actual run.

Good luck", "NTA, she is the AH if anything for taking a day that she knew was important to you and trying to turn it in to something about herself.\n\nI had similar with my GF at the time too, we did a 5K inflatable run with my work and I was desperate to finish first (there were 2-3 of us who were close).  She got really pissy when I told her I had no intention of running with her and said that's the only reason she did it.  Even though I had said so many times in the months leading up about how desperate I was to beat them all!\n\nAnyway. She's my wife now, and we're super happy.

She hurt her own feelings and expected something of you so entirely unreasonable, it baffles me.

You will find me running only if someone is chasing me to kill me. I hate it. I signed up for a 5k with him 10 years ago that we took our dogs to (it was a rescue run, dogs were invited) and realized I would only slow him down. Now, I will happily wake up early, drive him to the start line, get him all pumped, then go home and take the dogs on a leisurely walk so he doesn\u2019t have to later, go pick him up at the finish line and take him out to eat wherever he wants. That\u2019s how I can be a part of his day without being a hinder.", "INFO: Was the point of entering the 5K to be competitive (like to hit that sub 27 min goal) or was it to compete in something together as a couple? \n\nI feel like your goal was the former and hers was the latter. This breakdown in communication seems to be the cause of her reaction. I\u2019d say NTA, but talk to her and communicate your perspective more clearly and listen to her perspective. Maybe you can sign up for one that is just a couple\u2019s activity and another for more competitive purposes.", "NTA. You could however have talked to her about this scenario beforehand. \n\nYour gf sounds kinda emotionally immature so the mature thing to do here is to, when you are both in a lower affect, ask her what it is actually about. What did she expect? What did she want it to be like? What did this make her feel like? Maybe this was her way of trying to do something together as a couple. Yes, not the most smooth execution, but if you like her, you will probably like to know what's up. You should be able to tell her how this affected you too - being left to Uber home etc. But if this is a one time fluke it might be worth to be curious about what she actually wanted and imaged this event to be like. What I'm describing is basically DIY couple's therapy. If you want, you wouldn't take damage from doing real couple's therapy either. \n\nFinally: you're from the US right? Imagine that your gf has never really dealt with kilometers and then you tell her that it's going to take 27 mins... For someone in a land where you drive everywhere, it wouldn't be crazy to get this wrong.. and imagining that they could do it too. However, as a 30+ year old, referring to how they did stuff in middle school and believing that it still works is a bit.. weird, I must admit.", "YTA. For dating an AH. She way overreacted when you did the right thing. She is going to stab you when you actually end up being wrong", "So you knew in advance that there was no way she could run the event as fast as you. Did you sit down with her to tell her you are going for your personal goal and you will not wait for her, if and when she can't keep up? You knew this but didn't communicate. It was obvious she had no clue and that she had no idea she had no clue. If you choose to date someone who can't figure out stuff like this, you need to be very good at communicating or your relationship won't last.\n\nNAH. I wouldn't say there is anything so bad here that would make either one an AH, but you have a difficult time ahead of you when you try to explain to her that you expected her to be smarter than she is.", "Though I agree 100% you're NTA in any way, I do think it would've helped to bring it up earlier. Yes, you did inform her and ask her a few times if she was sure, but it seems from your writing that you knew she would not be able to keep up at the race itself because of her total lack of training. I think sitting her down a while before the race and telling her she was welcome to be there, but that you'd run alone, might've let her down a bit more gently.\n\nNow all that's left is to pick up the pieces though. While you aren't in the wrong, if you want to stay with your partner it would probably help to be empathic towards her feelings when you two have a talk (while also explaining and sticking true to your own feelings, of course).", "YTA\u2026AND YNTA lol. First of all, you knew the caliber of woman you have and should have known better than to allow her to mock your hobby. I say mock because when was the last time you saw her commit to any type of physical training? Exactly. Men, it\u2019s ok to tell your wife or girlfriend no because sometimes it\u2019s ok for things to be just for you. Don\u2019t let a spoiled person tell you otherwise. \n\nYou\u2019re  NTA because of the reasons everyone else stated. But I reflect to my original point, if you\u2019d have grabbed your balls and told her no in the first place, none of this would have happened. \n\nOne last thing, she actually left you?  Nah man, I don\u2019t care what kind of argument we are having, unless we talked about it, no one gets left when we drove together. She has issues and its an indicator of how she will handle future conflicts. What\u2019s worse is now she telling everyone how you \u201cleft\u201d her to make you seem like a bad guy. Mid 40\u2019s guy here, i would have a real heart to heart talk with her and the next time something like this happens, we are done. That is if you don\u2019t leave her now. Congrats on your big achievement and hope you figure it out brother!", "Women \u2615\ufe0f", "This could go both ways. \nYTA if you didn't make it abundantly clear you would not wait for her if she didn't keep up. I know you said you told her your goal but you should have demonstrate your pace... However....\nNTA if you did all of the above.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend wanted to spend time with you. She wanted quality time. Instead she got a partner who walked her up at 5am, doesn't take into consideration either or not she's a morning person. Why didn't you do evening training with her if your speed was so important to you? You then don't help her catch up to your training when you are already months a head of her. Then on the day of the race that she made time for so she could be with you, You are the one that ditched her. I'm amazed you still have a girlfriend.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say YTA. This came together as a joint venture and I don\u2019t think leaving her behind was worth it for a 5k", "YTA\n\nIn 5 years No one will remember your time on the 5k. She will, however, remember how you left her.", "YTA. If you want to try for your best time, do it alone. If you agree to do it with her then you agree to do it WITH her. Not ditch her when part of the fun for her was being with you during the event. There will be plenty of other 5k runs you can do alone for timing.", "Yes, I am an asshole, and that is something I would do.", "Going with ESH, if you were going for a best time, you shouldn\u2019t have invited her to run together. People going for PRs run their own race to achieve the best time possible.  The only way this would have worked is if she became a better runner than you with 3 weeks training, which was never realistic.", "I run races with my husband all of the time. By \"with\" we've established that we go together, hang out before the start, at the finish and go home together. We both run our own race.\n\nIt sounds like you both didn't do a good job of communicating beforehand. \n\nESH.", "YTA. I would never abandon my wife, no matter how much she was holding me back. I would be super stoked just having her there to enjoy it with me.", "NTA she needs to grow up and mature.", "NTA you did the work. She didn't. She fully expected you to just meander along with her.\n\nYou do you. She is responsible for her and she did this to herself. Its fine she didn't want to train and she fully expected to walk it.\n\nBut you had been training and working up to this and had a goal and a purpose. So NTA", "Nta of course, I mean I would have waited for her if I were in your position but I also wouldn\u2019t have made you wait if I were in her position. I feel like her request was selfish but not entirely unreasonable. I think you both would do well taking time to be more empathetic towards each other. Again, Nta at all, ultimately she is in the wrong here. Especially for how she yelled at you after", "NTA She is behaving like a child", "NTA she ditched you from the beginning.", "NTA in any way shape or form; you set clear expectations from the start (I want to run a sub 27 minute time) and so far as I can tell she never set any expectation that you both entering would mean running the race side by side (Info: did she?).", "NTA...whenever I do a 5k or 10k with someone, the plan is to go together, run whatever race you want, then meet up at the end. I'd never want to constrain someone to my pace if they wanted to go faster or make them feel like they were holding me back if they were slower. Her assumption that you'd want to go at HER pace after you said you've been training for this makes no sense.", "NTA - she took something that was important to you and made it about herself. Is she normally so dismissive of your goals? Instead of cheering you on she decided to become the main character- ask yourself if this is an isolated incident or a pattern of behavior.", "Nta. Your gf sounds like a spoiled brat my god.", "\nNTA and also I don\u2019t get why the assumption was that you guys would both stay together the entire time. If I was doing something athletic with my partner that was new for me, I wouldn\u2019t expect that he would do it at the same pace as me - I would expect that he would go for gold and leave me in the dust! Why couldn\u2019t she have just walked it (quite normal where I am to have people walk 5ks) and just meet you afterwards? This is odd.", "NTA. She knew you were training and she didn't. And so what if she was alone for a few hours? She obviously knew how to get home.", "NTA: she clearly didn\u2019t understand how all that training/running/race stuff works.  As you continue to progress with your new found passion you\u2019ll probably end up \u201crunning\u201d away from her.  She seems ridiculous.", "NTA because you were very clear that this was a \u201crace\u201d for you, and her asking you to walk when you\u2019re trying to make time is ridiculous. It\u2019s a 5K and she was maybe alone for an hour, tops. She will live. But it\u2019s not ok to drive away without you & not answer the phone. She doesn\u2019t seem to handle conflict well, and next time, I\u2019d suggest running the race alone.", "NTA. And you probably need a new girlfriend. Not sure this one is for you.", "NTA. You were up front about your goal. She decided not to train and take her time. Valid choice. She doesn't get to dictate your pace. She's totally TA for stranding you and pitching a fit.", "NTA it sounds like you\u2019re in a relationship with a child.", "NTA - tell your GF to stop being a selfish brat. She has two choices. Either get over herself or you will get over her.  \n\nIOW, she can either shape up or ship out.", "NTA. This was fucking hilarious, thanks for sharing!", "You should just point out that actually it was she who ditched you. Then start cry-shrieking like you're a teenager.", "NTA especially if you told the gf that you were at a 25 min finish for the whole thing, and that you were expecting to perform similarly that day. If she committed to doing this WITH YOU then she should have stepped her game up and trained accordingly. \nHowever, you may have to take the L here and apologize for leaving her behind. Obviously she was under the impression that you two were doing this together, even if it meant walking part of the way because of her. You didn't realize that she wanted to do it her way. \nBut let her know that in the future, there will be races you will want to compete in to challenge yourself, and that you would rather she be there to support you when you finish. But of course, if she wants to do a Color Run or some other crap in the future, know that's about the cute pictures and not about your finish time.", "NTA\n\nPlease tell me she skip-galloped home", "Incredible entitlement for her to try and stop you running the race she invited herself to. NTA", "NTA, lmao my mum used to ditch me at Park Run cos I was too slow, it ended up I had asthma", "NTA - Sounds like your girlfriend has some kind of influencer/main character complex. Huge red flag.", "NTA. Your girlfriend probably saw this as a fun bonding thing and you saw this as a goal. That's entirely her mistake and she needs to cop to it. Ask for better communication in the future so neither of you are disappointed, or call it quits if she expects everything to be a battle of telepathy.", "NTA. This is genuinely so funny and so ridiculous I can\u2019t stop laughing.", "Totally NTA.\n\nI've done a couple of 5Ks in the last year-ish.  One with a fitness group I belonged to at the time and the last one with my 12 year old and some friends.  I'm old, overweight and doing everything in my power to get out of this hellish prison I have confined myself to, but it's slow going but I'm moving in the right direction.  Both times I walked almost the entire course, did any of the obstacles that I could along the way (which wasn't many) and was the last one of my group to cross the finish line but I did it, I enjoyed myself.\n\nYou had a goal you were attempting to meet.  She didn't take you seriously and then expected you to forego meeting your goal to keep her company because she refused to train.  \nYour GF sounds really immature and she should have bowed out of the race if she wasn't in any shape to complete it without needing you to hold her hand knowing that you had a goal you were attempting to meet/beat.  You definitely do not deserve the treatment you are getting here.", "Sounds like she wanted to run it like Phoebe from Friends. NTA", "NTA you should show her this thread so she can understand how childish her behaviour is!!! Me me me me \u2026 nothing about how hard you trained for the run! You should be the one upset! Well done on meeting your target!", "NTA you didn\u2019t abandon her on the side of the road in the middle of the night. You ran ahead of her during a 5k race. You made it clear you were trying to beat your time before she even signed up. It\u2019s unacceptable she stranded you at the race. She\u2019s being ridiculous and owes you a big apology.", "NTA, I\u2019ve done races with my husband before and not expected to stay together since he is the stronger runner. You told your girlfriend that you were aiming for a specific time that she would have to seriously train to match but she didn\u2019t bother. I think the only thing you could\u2019ve done differently is at the time the skip gallop was mentioned really spell it out to her that you are going to try to go for your best time on the day, which means you will be at different places in the race and check she still wants to take part. But that shouldn\u2019t really have been necessary if she had listened before and her behaviour is unacceptable to not train and then expect to be babied, meaning you would lose your place. It\u2019s extra immature for her to throw a tantrum, then give you the silent treatment. This is a serious hobby of yours that she latched onto and didn\u2019t properly participate in, it\u2019s not like it was even meant to be a date or a day out together so doing things separately isn\u2019t wrong.", "The problem is you took it serious and she thought fun time. She didn\u00b4t expect the work and effort you put in your new hobby.\n\nNTA", "NTA. no worries, you're good  I'm sure she'll get over it. . Unfortunately, I think she'll get over running as well LOL", "NTA she is", "Are you sure you wanna date her? If this is the only instance like this, sure it's weird, but forgivable, but I have a feeling it isn't", "Definitely NTA, she\u2019s being ridiculous about it for sure. But I would say YTA because you could evidently see she wasn\u2019t prepared for this race and just let her ignorance continue instead of having a real conversation about it. I can\u2019t imagine this is the first time she\u2019s been childish like this so maybe improve your communication so you can avoid these bizarre situations. Or leave her bc after insisting she can go 5 miles on a skip gallop, she sounds crazy.", "NTA \n\nYou deserve a sincere apology or a new girlfriend. This is absolutely bananas that she thought she\u2019d be able to do this with zero training\u2026 oh wait\u2026 I don\u2019t think she did. It\u2019s hurtful to you that she didn\u2019t take this seriously for you. \ud83d\udea9all around. I suggest looking at other areas of your relationship that might be throwing up red flags.", "I think you know the answer. There are two options now: break up with her or ask her to read this and wait for her to break up with you.", "NTA.  This was completely selfish behavior on her part.   She didn't train, she knew your goal and yet she completely insisted that she was \"ready\".  Of course you ditched her!  She deserved to be ditched.  Why should you have to hang back and walk with the lame galloping horse???  Hell no.", "NTA. You told her you were running this one for your personal stats, and she had the chance to back out. It would be different if you'd presented it as a bonding experience, or if you'd been somewhere isolated and dangerous. Neither of these things was the case.", "Nta. It would seem you already have the right equipment and training to run away, far and fast from this one", "NTA - I sign up for several races a year with friends. Everyone runs or walks their own race and those who finish first cheer the rest at the finish.\n\nExpecting someone to hang back with you is not Normal.\n\nCongrats on your time. Maybe your next race will be faster without being held back from the start.", "NTA. And perhaps you should consider dating a fully functioning adult, not a sulky kid.", "NTA, you were taking it seriously and she knew that it matter to you and frankly was trying to ruin it for you for no reason. It would have been different if she actually tried to keep up with you and did her best, but she didn't even try. (If she tried her best and you love her I can see you slowing down for her). But nope. She didn't train at all. I don't know what she was expecting for something you were looking forward to and trained for.", "NTA", "You were very clear that you had a pacing goal and if she wanted to do it with you, she ought to train. She refused training each time except the one, and then has the audacity to get upset with you at the race? There's an asshole here and it's not you. \n\nNTA.\n\nAlso, the silent treatment is the sign of emotional stuntedness at best, and emotional abuse at worst. Red flags with this one...", "NTA because you told her she'd probably need to train and she didn't bother to. Of course she's not going to be able to keep up, and if she knew you were going for a specific time (as opposed to a casual family walk) then you had to go on ahead.", "She sounds like dead weight. \n\nPartners that act like this are insecure and frankly, not good signs of someone that will help you reach your full potential.", "NTA.  It's only 5K.  She could have had a nice walk.  But did you go back for her after you finished? That would have been nice.", "NTA - also, this need to do everything together is immature. We\u2019ve all been there though, but it\u2019s not healthy.\n\nEdit: She should\u2019ve been a spectator if she wanted to be included.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t bother preparing for the 5K run while you did and she\u2019s mad because she couldn\u2019t put in the time and effort in to get in shape", "nta at all.  your gf is and i wish you had asked her \u201cwtf? you ditched me after the race\u201d.  what she did was a jerk move.", "NTA. she left without you. she tried to slow you down every step of the way and she made a fool of herself at the starting line.\n\nOP. Are you guys even compatible? Two years isn't a very long time.", "NTA, but next time, apparently you need to really spell it out.  \"I'd love it if you came out, but I'm going to run the best possible time I can, not to go on a walk with you.\"", "NTA and she is very insulting in expecting you to invalidate all of the time and effort you put into training to walk with her, who had blown off every chance (except one) to put time and effort into preparing.", "NTA - she knew you were going to run. You told her what time you were shooting for. She had the opportunity to train and run as much of it as she could. She could\u2019ve walked it. I\u2019ve walked several 5ks. She wouldn\u2019t have been the only one. You would\u2019ve waited for her to finish and she probably would\u2019ve felt a sense of accomplishment. Sounds like she\u2019s angry at herself and taking it out on you. She\u2019s way out of line.", "Nope. Get some.", "NTA you didn\u2019t ditch her, she ditched her training and so ditched what she signed up for.\n\nShe half arsed it at best and expected you to give up something you had worked for because she was suffering the consequences of her own lack of effort and dedication. \n\nDo Not marry someone who blames you for their own laziness and inability to follow through with their promises.", "NTA.  This is bizarre behavior and she should apologize.  My guess (if this is real) is that she is having a strong emotional reaction to running into her physical limits for the first time in a while.  \n\nExercising together can be difficult to navigate even when both partners start on the same page.  It sounds like you were pretty clear that you were going to this race with the intent to actually push yourself, so it\u2019s unreasonable of her to expect you to stay with her.", "So you communicated from the very beginning what you intended to do. She wasn't ditched or abandoned, but it's pretty telling that she was so triggered by it.\n\nShe actually abandoned you by taking the car. That was her first punishment toward you.\n\nThe second punishment she dished was shrieking and crying at you, making a day you had planned to enjoy into a crisis.\n\nThe third punishment is her giving you the silent treatment.\n\nIt sounds to me like she has some pretty unlikeable qualities my dude. Her warped perception of situations is all the permission she needs to start punishing you. I would be shocked as hell if this wasn't a pattern with her. This is the kind of emotion dis-regulation healthy people seek therapy for, and hopefully she gets it.\n\nEdit: NTA", "This is one of those scenarios you separate your hobbies. You don\u2019t have to do everything together", "She seems immature and selfish. NTA", "NTA. \n\nGeez... your girlfriend has some emotional issues. You joined a race with a goal, she knew of that goal, she didn't support you, she didn't take this race seriously, so she deserves to bite the dust.", "You should be angry at her for trying to hold you back.", "Your gf sucks prepare for a life of bullshit or leave now.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is weird bro.", "NTA, but this is actually a really good fight to have. You warned and you warned, but she ignored you and expected you to blow off the entire event and goal of the event so you could do a cutesy couples thing with her.\n\nThat's very selfish. I had to go back and check the ages...I expected her to be in her early twenties. 31 is a little old to be acting like a brat.", "No the asshole whatsoever", "NTA - you told her your goals. She ignored them expecting you to make your hobby all about her.", "I ran a 5k with an ex and she was in much better shape than me. I told her to just go on ahead, the 5k is like 30 mins of time, and we\u2019d meet up after. It\u2019s not a big deal. \n\nOf course she was mad that I was slow, which is one reason she\u2019s an ex, but yikes, if your partner is training for something and wants a good time then you support them!", "NTA !", "NTA, wow, GF sounds selfish. You told her your goals and she made it all about her.", "NTA she ditched you for weeks leading up to the race", "NTA but she totally is. You trained for this exact thing. Why she thought a stupid \u201cskip gallop\u201d would keep up with an actual runner, is beside me. Let alone the selfish notion that you should forgo all of your training to \u201cwalk with her\u201d. She\u2019s super selfish.", "Years ago my wife got seriously into running for health. I do not particularly enjoy running but wanted to try a 5k here and there.\n\nShe made it very clear she was in it for the best times she could muster. Yeah, she totally finished way before I did.\n\nOnly once did we ever run a 5k together. She was doing a 1/2 marathon the next day, and decided the 5k would be a good warmup for it. I was out there, huffing & puffing, doing my best, and I look over and she's barely speed walking. I asked her to at least pretend like she was running ;)\n\nWe also did a 1/2 marathon relay together... she did the first leg, and then we both did the second leg together.\n\nBoth times it was totally planned ahead & agreed upon that she'd go at my pace.\n\nI few years later, the tables had turned a bit. I was in better shape than before, and she hadn't been running in a long time. I pushed the running stroller, and ended up significantly faster, and PR for me.\n\nOh, and NTA. You told her you were going for a PR. She's acting out because she's embarrassed herself.", "NTA, and you were the one who was ditched as you were the one who had to Uber home. Imagine if you were the one who took the car home without her, you'd be crucified. \n\nYou are dating someone with the emotional maturity of a middle schooler. Probably why she runs like one.", "Going to a race together does not mean running together. You run with people that pace you unless you\u2019re entering the race just to complete it with no eye to times. You expressed in advance that you wanted to meet a time so before you even left, she should have expected to just meet you at the finish line.\n\nNTA but next time be very clear you will be following a set pace and not waiting. Weird she\u2019s so unfamiliar with running not to already get this but alas\u2026", "NTA. Not sure what the heck she got skip gallop from and thought it would be ok for 5k but that was a fail. You took it seriously and gave her a heads up you were training to do so. She thought it was a game and FAFO. Not your fault.", "NTA.\n\nShe clearly sees that running is a big deal to you, so wants to be in on that part of your life and bond with you over it.  However, you're doing it with a goal.  If she's holding you back on that, she's better off cheering you on at the finish line.\n\nYou guys can jog other times.  A competition where one of you is at a higher level is not that time.", "She\u2019s a pain in the ass. NTA", "NTA.  Your GF didn't train and the \"skip-gallop\" bullshit is beyond words.  She needs to take a serious look at her self.  I would go head long into her attempt to sabotage your run.  Turn the tables; from her sttempts to stop you training, to her bizarre prancing that only had one objective.  Just repeat \"why did you want to stop me from running? what is your problem... do you not want me to do these things?  If you wanted to take part your would have trained and run like a normal person...\"", "NTA at all.\n\nI did a series of 5ks while my husband was out of the country for work for a few months. He was back for the last few and I invited him along. Even though I had been running daily, he was still faster than me and left me in his dust. We met at the finish line like normal people and enjoyed a beer together. I signed up for those 5ks with a bunch of friends and we all ranged in average times from sub 20 mins to more than 35.", "NTA  \nyou didn't ditch her, she ditched you. you both went to do an event, instead of finishing slower she quit and left, she wasn't abandoned at the side of the road with no way home or anything", "Nta. You\u2019re allowed to have hobbies for yourself, she doesn\u2019t have to be included in everything you do. It would have been nice to run the marathon together, but she couldn\u2019t keep up despite the warnings to train and now she\u2019s making it about herself. She expected you to put your desire to do well in the marathon aside for the sake of just doing it with her, and that\u2019s not fair. You can have other activities that you can do together, and you can have things for yourself. \nThis would be like if I forced my fianc\u00e9 to take me on one of his big snowboarding trips and then made him hang back with me instead of enjoy himself because I don\u2019t know how to snowboard. \n\nAlso, her skip-gallop sounds like the solution of a sitcom character.", "NTA. I really want to see this skip-gallop technique.", "NTA.  She was the AH for leaving you to take an Uber home.  \n\nYou are right, she brought it on herself. She didn't train and she didn't listen to your warnings.  \n\nIt's her own fault.", "NTA. It was a nice notion that she \u201cwanted\u201d to share your hobby, but by doing nothing of substance to actually try, she forfeited any legitimate right to be mad about your run", "NTA.  Though I do think it\u2019s clear (if you intend in staying in s remains with this person) you two need to find a way of communicating that works for you both.\n\nI ran a 15k with my friends. We all have very different running, so we\u2019re hung out before and cheered each other on at the finish line- the actual race was solo. Everyone had a blast. When I ran s 5k with my young daughter, I gave up attempting to run at my pace and simply started with her at s pace she was comfortable with. Maybe you can run races that are just for you and also set up a race for you and your girlfriend to run together. Your races you can focus on time and the races with your girlfriend can all be about the vibes lol", "\nNTA and the delusion of your gf is hysterical!", "NTA at all but for some perspective, I think your gf was trying to get into a hobby you love for you and she saw it as a bonding experience and took it personal when you left her. Did she know you were trying to his sub 27min?", "NTA - if you wanted to try and understand where she\u2019s coming from you could ask why it happened? It sounds like she may of been threatened by your personal development and wanted to sabotage it. I think you set some healthy boundaries but I would probably follow up as this could fester if not addressed", "NTA you told her from the start what you were wanting to get out of the race. It is not your fault that she didn't bother training and probably felt embarrassed once she was in the midst of all those people who DID train and she realsied how out of her depth she was. So, she threw a tantrum and it still acting like a child about it.\n\nAgain, NTA, but you need to have a conversation with your gf about how that kind of reaction and the silent treatment are totally unacceptable in a grown up relationship.", "NTA\n\nShe's being absolutely ludicrous here, across the board. She may be embarrassed but it was in  no way on you to sacrifice the event and goal you were excited about and worked for. This obviously meant absolutely nothing to her given her disinterest in preparing.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou set a goal on your own. She asked to join, which you agreed to. She then did NOT join, and expected you to blow of something you originally planned to do alone and trained for in order to walk with her. She\u2019s being unreasonable", "NTA My SO and I trained together for a 5k and they said they would wait for me to keep up at the actual race. I said don\u2019t be ridiculous, run your best time and I\u2019ll run mine. They finished before me as expected and there was no issue. It\u2019s ridiculous that she thinks you should throw the race for her. If you were taking a social walk together it would make sense to slow down to her pace, but competing in a 5k? Nah. Everyone should run their best time or don\u2019t bother jointing a race.", "Does she have to do everything with you? \n\nDoes she have her own hobbies that don't include you?\n\nThose are both very important for her to have because this feels very clingy and delusional like she is trying to latch onto you even if she can't keep up or properly train she still wants to be at your side the entire time, and even if due to her lack of preparation, it's your fault because you didn't include her, even though you damn well tried your best", "NTA. \n\nFrom what you said, it sounds like you were clear with her about what you wanted out of this. I don't think you were wrong, but the only thing I can think of that you could have done differently was to literally say \"OK, just to be clear, I am doing this to go as fast as I can. If you can't keep up, I am going to keep going. As long as you are ok with that, let's go.\"\n\nIt feels like you pretty much did everything but be super explicit like what I wrote above.", "Nah man, you tried to warn her! Lol it was sweet of her to want to show interest in your stuff but she knew going in that you had a goal! Plus she didn\u2019t really prepare like she should have\u2026and that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not for her! I certainly wouldn\u2019t be upset with you for doing what you said you were gonna do, I\u2019d be proud of you!", "NTA. I\u2019m doing an evil villain laugh at the thought of your girlfriend doing a skip-gallop during a 5k. I wish I could have been there to see it. I could only imagine what the other runners were thinking when they saw that ridiculousness!", "I have been running the local Parkrun for a few years and recently asked my wife if she wanted to join me. The first time we took it gently finishing in 35 minutes instead of my usual 27. I even let her pass me at the finish. Since then she has out run me every time and her PB is 24:13. I wish I never asked her. BTW we are both 51.", "Your girl is delulu.", "NTA\n\nThis read like some absurd sitcom. I can\u2019t believe she thinks she is in the right in this. \n\nIf she had actually committed to the month long training with you, I might think you would have been wrong to ditch her. But she didn\u2019t. And then she did a ridiculous move from childhood\u2026 seriously\u2026 is she all there up there??? \n\nThis was your interest. She was a tag along. She put zero effort into taking this seriously. \n\nYou should be mad at her not the other way around. I hope she reads some of these comments because she\u2019s off her damn mind", "NTA. You told her you were taking it seriously and trying to get a sub-27 time, yet she wanted you to stay and walk with her anyway. Basically, this woman co-opted a day that was supposed to be for you, made it about her, and when you wouldn't have it she cried and threw a fit. The smart thing to do here for her would have been to either not go, or support from the sidelines. The mature thing here if she did go was to understand and respect what you were trying to do, by letting you go ahead and meeting you at the finish line.\n\nYour gf sounds like she's really immature and doesn't respect your hobbies. Sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA. Apparently your gf is both dumb and an AH. I would be mad at her if I were you. She's the one that did the ditching.", ">I apologized, told her I loved her, and left her behind to finish the race.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenuinely hilarious.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's your turn to get mad at her. You didn't Ditch her, she actually ditched you. And on top of that she didn't keep her promise to train for it or make any effort.\n\nSo go get mad with her and don't allow her to set the narrative.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you had the balls to do you. \n\nYou trained for this. It is YOUR hobby and you had YOUR goal which she was aware of.\n\nShe can pout all day. She\u2019s in the wrong", "NTA and I would pay to see footage of the skip-gallop.", "Ain\u2019t no way she should expect you to walk when she knew you were planning this seriously", "Nta. Dump her and tell her to get side galloping out of your life!", "NTA,\n\nYour serious about it she is not. You had a goal /she didn't. \n\nShe's a dip shit on top of being an asshole.", "Keep running and don't look back.", "Kind of the AH. Sure she didnt train but thats your lady. You ditched her and you shouldn't have. You could have ran another 5K without her and explained that this is why. She just didn't realize that it was actually important to you. But yeah, kind of.", "NTA  \nApologize to her if she gives you a good answer on why was she trying to ruin the race for you?", "NTA. If you had invited her to run the 5k with you then I would say yes, but you never intended on running this with a partner, and she was the one who decided she wanted to then did absolutely no training to even attempt to keep up with you. If anything, she\u2019s TA for leaving you afterward and making you Uber home all because she was mad. She\u2019s lucky you had your phone on you so that you were able to get a ride.", "I\u2019m dying laughing imagining the skip gallop. Thanks for the LOL. NTA.", "I'm more caught on the fact that someone enjoys running.", "As a runner I can empathize as my husband is not one for running either.  NTA but consider yourself lucky to learn just how immature and needy your girlfriend is.  If I were you I'd run and find an adult who has healthy boundaries and expectations because this my friend is just a taste of what is in store if you continue with this relationship with a seeming child.", "NTA - she invited herself and then expected you to keep her pace, even though you told her that you were planning on running it as a runner, not as a \"this is fun thing to say I did.\"  She needs to be more realistic about her abilities and recognize that there is a time to do things together, and a time to do things independently. \n\nTHAT BEING SAID, and this doesn't change my vote at all, it's just a thought... I suspect that she was feeling cut out of your life because of the increasing importance of running, and this was her poorly thought out attempt to make time for you as a couple... Maybe take a little time (assuming she gets her head out of her tail and accepts that she is the core of this problem) for the two of you now that the 5k is behind you.", "NTA. She\u2019s being selfish. She should be proud of you.", "NTA - Shes the one who ditched you. You had to Uber home from an event, not her. Give he the silent treatment back", "Skip gallop away from this relationship", "NTA!!!", "NTA. The mental visual of a grown adult wanting to skip gallop a 5K made me LOL for real, but her request of you waiting around for her to do this is ridiculous \ud83d\ude02 You did the right thing.", "NTA", "NTA. My sister and I do annual 5ks together. I tend to walk mine, and she tends to walk/jog. She finishes before me, I don't get mad at her for leaving me behind. I actually see it as a challenge because now I have to speed up so she doesn't have to wait as long. \n\nShe brought this on herself. You told her what you were doing. She wanted to do it, she chose not to train. For her to expect you to give up your goals for her is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou told her you goal. EVEN IF SHE HAD TRAINED WITH YOU you would not have been in the wrong for leaving her because she couldn\u2019t keep up because YOU TOLD HER YOUR GOAL. She knew what you planned and still decided to join you in the 5K.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s beyond ironic that she\u2019s crying about you leaving her in the race when she LITERALLY stranded you and drove home without you.", "Nta and I really want to see the skip gallop", "NTA - my wife is a runner. I\u2019m not - or at least haven\u2019t been in 15 years or so. We signed up for a charity race together and I kept pace for the first couple km. After that, I needed to walk for a minute and she just kept going. I met her at the end. \n\nThere was never a moment where I thought she should stay back with me. She\u2019s a great runner and she should be able to enjoy the run. Forcing her to walk would have been selfish and dumb. \n\nThe only thing that could have helped this is to work on your communication and lay out your expectations before the run. Still NTA.", "Your gf sees how much you enjoy running, and is jealous of you for it. So her solution, probably subconsciously, is to stop you enjoying it. Screw that! NTA. Does she do this with anything else you enjoy and she doesn't?", "NTA. She didn\u2019t train.", "\u201cSkip-galloping\u201d? wtaf? Hahaha!", "NTA. I've been the person who wanted to run 5K with my SO. And I hated it but I was dragged out, and I trained. It was horrible. When we trained together, they never left my side. However, when the time came, I didn't expect them to jog alongside me. I couldn't expect them to spoil their personal timing with me.\n\nI was also the person who 'couldn't possibly do' a 10K or 11K or 21K. So when my SO signed up for those, yes, I went everytime. I also took a short novel or downloaded a book and waited for them at the finish line (and then we did breakfast together).\n\nThere are ways of doing things together without getting the other person down ESPECIALLY when they have their own set goals.", "NTA. The expectation that you would hold yourself back so you could run together is mild boggling. If you said you would and then didn't that's one thing. But she was the one that chose to run a 5k with no training at all.\n\nIf she wanted someone to walk it with her she should have reached out to a friend to go with her. But you said from the get go what your goal was. So why would you expect anything different?\n\nThe fact that she left you there is extremely immature. I had to double check your ages because I figured she was in her early 20s at best. In all reality she is the one that left you there and hopefully you pointed it out. She did the ditching!", "NTA.  The only thing I would suggest would be to talk about the potential for you running ahead of her before the race.  But it wouldn't be fair to ask you to walk the entire way when you have trained for months for the race.", "Noooo NTA! She\u2019s TA!", "NTA, and look out for other red flags.", "My parents met during a race in Athens. A few of the only Americans there. My dad started off running alongside my mom, but eventually she lost pace with him, and he finished the race before her. But, he decided that he really likes her, and went back to the course, and somehow found her, and kept pace with her until she finished! They got married a few years after that.", "NTA. If she wants to run events with you, she must train.\n\nShe should stick to joining you for very casual runs if she's not as serious.\n\nAnyone I've done an event with we've agreed beforehand if one of us has it in us, to go ahead.", "NTA. It\u2019s selfish of her to expect you to stay back and play with her bc she wasn\u2019t taking the run seriously", "NTA\n\nPpl in the comments going all \u201cbUt Did yOu tAlK tO hEr bEfOrEhAnD?? cOmMuNiCaTiOn~\u201d\n\nUhm, did you not read the same post as I did?\n\nYes\u2026yes he did. I really don\u2019t see how much clearer OP could\u2019ve been.", "NTA and it seems like she could really use some therapy. That's an extremely childish attitude for someone her age.", "NTA\n\nI am still trying to imagine this skip gallop.  Is anyone else puzzled by this  style of running?  I kind of want to see it.", "NTA those road races can cost an easy 30 bucks a pop, if not more. Doesn\u2019t make sense to do all that training and pay the fee to just walk it. You got into that hobby. Time, effort, literal sweat to get better. She did next to nothing to train and thought a weird strategy would work. She interjected herself. She should be the one to say to go without her. She should have realized she was holding you back on something she obviously doesn\u2019t care about. \n\nHer leaving you at the race is absolutely ridiculous. Totally disregard for your safety and well-being. Imagine if you did that? There\u2019s no way you\u2019d hear the end of it. \n\nanyone saying op is the problem is asking him to sacrifice his goals and even part of his identity. She didn\u2019t care about what he wanted or why from the race. She made it about her more than anything. \n\nShe needs to own up that she was wrong and owes you a huge apology. A healthy relationship is one where each partner can support the other\u2019s goals and ambitions and not feel the need to interject themselves into them like this. You need to set a healthy boundary between this and her. She will probably not be very supportive of the next few races, and that\u2019s on her. \n\nKeep up the running. Great job", "Nta.  What was she trying to accomplish with all this?", "She doesn\u2019t sound mature enough for a relationship", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand how she thought you would wait with her the entire time. It\u2019s a RACE.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t train or take the race seriously.  Get over it!", "She really couldn\u2019t wait 26 minutes for you to finish?  \n\nShe straight up decided to ditch you in less than a half hour, probably within five minutes even.  And now she\u2019s acting like you\u2019re the bad guy.  Um.  None of that is healthy.\n\nNTA", "> I tried to calm her down and explain that she kind of brought it on herself but she was not interested whatsoever.\n\nNTA, but you tried to explain to an angry person that it was their own fault and that didn't go over well?

Celebrate that she showed up.  Celebrate that she tried an imaginative new technique.\n\nResist allowing negative thoughts and emotions to enter this mental landscape around running and exercise.  It is a trap to allow in negativity and it will hurt your exercise regime.\n\nYour GF is acting like she has no power and no initiative in how she acts and reacts.  \n\nBe a good partner/coach and help her see that she has power in her exercise practise and her life.", "NTA. She expected you to wreck your 5k experience for her? Her relationship expectations would have me rethinking some things. This will happen again somehow.", "NTA and she left with the car ??? I would have break up.", "NTA - you trained towards a specific goal. You tried to include her, she didn't follow through. You had no reason to change your goal to accommodate her inability to plan.\n\n100% on her, not you.", "NTA- if you want to remain in this relationship, you need to tell your girlfriend to schedule a therapy appointment. If she doesn\u2019t then tell her you two need to plan an exit strategy. I say this because, as someone who has been in a 20 year relationship I can tell you with confidence that the things that bother you now will only become more frequent with the ongoing years. You either need to develop skills to handle certain behaviours in a healthy way or you will become disgruntled. Also, you cannot act surprised when this type of thing happens again in the future.", "My wife runs 3 times a week. Cardio is not my thing to say the least. Honestly, I wouldn't even Think about asking to tag along because I know I'd hold her back, and it would be selfish of me to expect her to run with me which is why I wouldn't ask because she's the type who would destroy her time or drop out entirely because of me. It's sweet that your gf wanted to come, but honestly I don't think she realized how it would affect your performance. This is one of those times where a long truthful talk can't be avoided. Just be patient with her, air your grievances, and actively listen and acknowledge hers. Best of luck.", "NTA she didn\u2019t respect that what you are doing is difficult and requires commitment. She also missed the opportunity to learn and instead made it about her. She sounds pretty insufferable.", "Nta, she didn\u2019t dedicate any time or effort to do the marathon. You had a goal you wanted to achieve which she knew. She put herself in the position to be left behind.

Like was she going to do it this way the whole time just to make you feel bad. Something tells me that this run is bringing other matters to the surface with it.", "NTA \n\nShe had the opportunity to train with you, but declined. Once she realized her foolishness 2 minutes into the race she should have apologized to you and encouraged you to go on ahead. Instead you told her you loved her and apologized before going on to see if all the effort your training helped you reach your goal time. And her taking the car and leaving you without a text or waiting for you to finish the race\u2026well, shame on her.", "NTA - no reasonable adult would expect to run a 5k without any training and stay with someone who's been training for a while and runs as much as you do. However, YTA because no reasonable runner would agree to this. You invited this misery upon yourself. You should have set reasonable expectations for your girlfriend and clearly explained them to her as the more experienced runner.", "NTA is her name Phoebe by chance lol but i would have handled it differently if i knew she was gonna be sup par i would have made her invite a friend to walk with so i could go for a competitive time.", "NTA. You had a great time and trained for this plus you beat your best time good on you OP. Gf did not train at all and seemed to have a weird way about it so she didn't have fun.

I'm a cyclist rather than a runner, for events there are two possible rules on this, stay together, or keep up or get left behind, you just make it clear beforehand.

You made her aware that you would leave her behind if she couldn't keep up. She knew that you had been training hard to make this goal.", "NTA. Oh my god her reaction is unhinged for a 31 year old woman who\u2019s a full-grown adult and not a baby. The fact that she took the car, essentially leaving you there stranded, is VERY selfish. You let your girlfriend know ahead of time what your goal was. She seems mad that you actually meant what you said instead of just throwing the 5K in the bin to hang out with her instead. It\u2019s totally understandable that you wanted to finish the 5K as you had intended it, which really is not about her in the slightest. I am sorry you weren\u2019t able to properly celebrate your accomplishment.", "NTA, she's trying some serious manipulation shit on you.  See it for what it is.  She has no leg to stand on argument wise.\n\nShe wants you to do what she wants you to do when she wants you to do it, which is not a logical or reasonable relationship arrangement.\n\nHold your ground on this one.

Don't apologize to make peace.", "You're good. \n\nWhen I sign up for longer races my wife say's she'll cheer me on from somewhere along the course.\n\nIf we've done a warrior dash or shorter race, then we decide if we're going together or our own pace. Neither of us get upset if the other chooses to separate.", "NTA...  You had a clear goal, informed her of the goal and went for it..  Congratulations.  She's being a child and if she wasn't capable of keeping up, that is her problem.", "You're not an asshole, as much as your partner is. Sounds like she can't run very well yet and bit off more than they could chew...", "NTA. Your girlfriend set up herself for failure and wanted you to join the ride.

She will try to hold you back.", "If anyone was TA here, it was GF who took the car home and left you to take an Uber home.", "NTA\nI can't believe she wanted you to walk/jog with you when she knew you had been training and had a specific time goal you were shooting for. \n\nMy wife and I have done over 300 5/10k, half and full marathons. We run at different paces, so in all that time, we've only completed 4 or 5 races together as those particular races were more about the scenery (ex: Crater Lake, OR) instead of time.\nI was always at the finish line cheering her on when she crossed and hand her a water. I would then walk with her during her cool down.\nNever once did she try to keep up with me, nor did she ever ask me to slow my pace so we could run together.", "NTA what the fuck did she expect????????", "NTA but be clearer prior to the race that if she went and didn\u2019t maintain your speed you would leave her behind", "Nta. You signed up for a 5k run, not a 5k walk.  Good job on hitting your goal OP. I read somewhere that around the 2 year mark is when you really start to see how a person really is.  Your gf throwing this fit might be a warning sign of things to come.", "NTA. This is 100% bizarre.", "NTA. She\u2019s selfish for imposing on your goal and not even trying.", "NTA. This sounds kind of petty of her. I can understand feeling upset by being left but I'm gathering she probably knew your commitment and such to a decent time. At least I hope you communicated that with her at some point. She should have realized that meant the likelihood of being left behind was likely .", "NTA Shes terrible. You got a good preview of your life together.", "NTA.  This was your race & she tagged along.  You told her your goal & there's no way you could accomplish that goal waiting for her.

You were clear about your intentions for this race from the beginning. You had a goal in mind and that was your primary reason for doing it. Your girlfriend wanted to turn it into \u201ccouple time\u201d, which you were okay with, but that didn\u2019t take the place of your primary goal, and again you were pretty clear about that. Your girlfriend could have trained for the race so that both of you could achieve your goals, yours to complete the race within the time you were aiming for and hers to spend that time with you, but instead she chose to try to hold you back from achieving your goal so that she could have hers without putting the extra effort in, and then got mad at you for not playing into that.", "Aside from everything else, she left you there after the race and took the car leaving you to get an Uber but you ditched her?!\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nMy husband and I both run but he is much faster and has done a few marathons while the most ice done is some very slow half marathons.

So why not discuss with her ahead of time what would happen if she needed to slow down but you wanted to keep going? Like you saw this conflict coming, why not head it off?", "NTA- she expected you to ditch your time goal and finish last.

I'm just in terrible shape and they were young so that was the other reason. The event didn't care, it was for the kids not anything else. I mean if someone wanted to run it and that was their business. I had paid an entrance fee and made a donation so I could pretty much do whatever I wanted. But if I was with somebody who wanted to run it I would not have had any problem with them leaving me in the dust.

That shit sounds hilarious.\n\nBtw. Congratz on beating your goal!", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, congrats on beating your goal! That's awesome. \n\nAs a slow runner, I get wanting the people you're running with to pace you. My running bestie averages like a 8:30-9:00 pace, where as I average between a 10:30-11:00 pace.

You were trying for your best time and she put no effort into any kind of training", "NTA. Sorry, but she sounds like the type to wear pajama pants to gym class and walk the mile.

These races are personal, with personal goals/times you set to meet, then beat in future races. Your race had nothing to do with her. Don't even get me started on her refusal to train and that ridiculous galloping thing.

It sounds like she never took it seriously and either didn't trust you or didn't believe you.", "NTA. She\u2019s crazy.", "NTA. You said right away what your intentions were for this race - you were going into it after training and wanted to beat a set time. I would understand her more if you had both signed up just for the hell of it and as a fun thing to do together, results be damned. But you made it very clear at the beginning that you wanted to achieve your goal (congrats, btw!) and that involved running the race competitively.", "Yes you are.", "NTA - she's embarrassed and projecting.  How someone deals with embarrassment can be quite telling.  If she doesn't apologize and take ownership of her own lack of preparation, she needs some personal development and maturing.  I wouldn't want to be with someone like that long term unless they were actively working on themselves.", "NTA. Is your girlfriend 8 years old??", "NTA.  She couldn't do it.  She may have thought it would be easy.  She knew you were trying for a particular time finish.  She's being extremely childish.", "I run races with my wife all the time.  She has the understanding that I need to run my race.  I will, however, run back and find her after I finish and run my cooldown with her.  It's a win-win-win because I get to run my race, I get in a cooldown and we get bonus pictures of us together in the race.  But anyways, I do think she's overreacting here.  Especially since she didn't train for it. NTA", "NTA.\n\nShe knew you were doing this for a goal, and decided she wanted to join, but then decided not to train.  \n\nAnd crying about being ditched?  It was a 5k.  Can she not finish this on her own?", "NTA. Sounds like she didn't understand what a sub 27min time entailed. She underestimated the distance of the race and the speed you'd be running at, which she would've been more aware of had she trained with you more often. She probably felt embarrassed she couldn't keep up and felt self conscious. None of which is YOUR responsibility. Races can be quite humbling. I do 5ks, 10ks, and half marathons multiple times a year with my husband and there's always a 10 year old or a 70 year old smoking me, which rids me of all my excuses. My husband always finishes before me. Instead of me whining, I train more and try to improve my time.

My wife ran a 10K a few years ago and I had zero interest.  I took her to the race and was there at the finish line cheering for her.  Your GF wanted to join you, didn't train for it, you did, you finished the race and beat your goal, she couldn't finish half a mile.  That's on her for not training and if she cannot be happy for you, then that's a sign my friend.  You deserve better.", "ESH - I'm leaning towards NTA, except this was just a 5k. You say you're running 25 miles a week so a 5k is nothing and I'm struggling to understand why you needed to take it so seriously. It wasn't a marathon, or even a 10k.  Your gf was obviously trying to share in your new hobby, and you basically abandoned her for not treating it like the Olympics. What I will say is there will be countless more opportunities to run a 5k, but I'd be surprised if you get another chance to share your hobby with your partner, so I guess it's just a question of which is more important to you.", "I dis a 20 miles with 8 friends once.

What usually would happen is I'd get the silent treatment for a day or two while she figured out her feelings, and then she'd come to me with an apology for acting the way that she did.\n\nThis behavior is *not* acceptable, but I'm just trying to give perspective that it can get better and I'd recommend OP communicate with her when things have calmed down and possibly suggest couples therapy so they can discuss with a professional.", "I've summed that up in my comment slightly more ubruptly \ud83e\udd23", "Right! My most recent 5k gave our ice cream and beer at the end of the race.", "I have done one 5k in my entire life and I hated it because it was advertised to me as a charity *WALK*/run but I was a kid and signed up with my school and the teachers *would not let me walk*. They kept scolding me for stopping and made me jog or run the entire time, and I'm not fit or a runner, I just wanted to do it for the cancer charity because my aunt had breast cancer. I was actually crying most of the way and begging them to just let my friend and I walk, and they wouldn't let us. \n\nHave never ever wanted to do another one of those things again, charity or not.", "My husband I did the same thing recently for a fundraiser 5K we ran. I\u2019ve been running and training and he hasn\u2019t, and we talked about it ahead of time to know going into it if we were going to try and run together our each run our own pace. And he happily told me to go my own pace because I was trying to get a good time (24:30! I was hype)", "Totally, we do the same. He is much faster than me, so we are clear at the outset if we\u2019re both running the race - will we run together (he paces me, which means running slower than what he\u2019s capable of) or we run at our own paces. The key is communication and also celebrating each other\u2019s accomplishments. I loans when he trains and runs his best - if he beat his goal like OP, I would be the first one celebrating his time!", "The \u201cskip-gallop\u201d thing takes this post to an entirely new level of insanity \ud83e\udd23", "While that is true, running has gotta be one of the single most \"solved\" athletic motions around lol", "Weird take. OP made his expectations perfectly clear for months. GF tried to usurp those expectations last-second because she very clearly did not commit the time and energy to attain them, intentionally it would seem.\n\nNow, if that was all, maaaaaybe you could convince me there were no aasholes. But no, she ditched him with no ride and no communication because he chose to follow through on his previously very clearly stated goal. And then screamed at him after!\n\nObvious NTA and GF is shitty as hell. If you think this is acceptable behavior, I regret to inform you that you are in an abusive relationship or are going to be.", "It does when one of them was warned the other is going for a sub 27 minute time. Then the other does not prepare, tries to utilize a running method from elementary school, crashes and burns, demands the other to stop and walk with them, takes their only car home and ditches the other, then starts cry shrieking about the matter. What a nightmare of a person this lady behaved as, and what total narcissistic actions.\n\nOh and jogging will likely now be an issue moving forward since she is hurt about the whole thing.", "Middle school. \ud83d\ude06 \nShe used this method in middle school and thought it works work \ud83d\ude06", "Did it really work in high school though?", "not even high school MIDDLE school lmfaoooo", "I still don't get it. What video did you watch?", "Me too,  I'm still not sure what that looks like", "I'm picturing a faster version of Prancercise.", "I\u2019m imagining her with her hands up miming like she\u2019s holding the reins", "I\u2019m sure she\u2019s familiar with the art of prancercise.", "I agree, I would think OP's GF has tried tactics like this before. Can you imagine the challenge it was picking an apt with her? I hope the sex is good cuz damn.", "Lol everyone can have their moments. It\u2019s definitely a red flag and I\u2019d be weary for a while after an incident like this. If she completely 180\u2019d and apologized for acting crazy I\u2019d give them a second chance. \n\nIn OP\u2019s story, it\u2019s just that she had so many opportunities to either train, back out, support OP, not freak out, etc\u2026 And then she ditched him and freaks out. It\u2019s less of a bad moment in this case and more of just bad behavior.", "Yeah. The one thing I hate about this subreddit is they will take 1 issue and typically frame someone's entire personality and existence on that one issue. Case and point the one you responded to.\n\nIn this frame OP painted it shows the gf having a bad moment. While possible I doubt she is like this 24/7. Everyone has their moments where they act stupid. For whatever reason OPs gf had it in her head he would wait. It's a lesson for both. For him to be much more clear, even though he was pretty clear about his intentions, and for her to lower her expectations when it's required.", "It\u2019s not miscommunication when he made it clear multiple times his goal was to perform. She invited herself, she refused to train for weeks on end, and then still wanted to come anyway and then she left a race that was only 25 mins long and left him there and then refused to answer her phone. There is def an AH in this scenario.", "And she wasn't smart enough to put two and two together. I mean, her running style, skip-gallop? She was totally clueless and OP knew it.\n\nNobody is forcing OP to date people who aren't very smart, but is he chooses to, he needs to take that into account.", "Absolutely. Why wouldn't I say exactly the same thing?\n\nThe person, who is not training and thinking they can skip-gallop as fast as someone else is running, isn't very smart, and there are only 2 things you can do when the other person isn't very smart. Either get better at communicating so that you can explain everything without them getting the feeling they are being patronized (which they ofc are), or dump them and find a smarter bf/gf. Nothing else will solve the issue in the long run. I expect OP to be so smart, that they already know their gf isn't very smart, so this isn't something OP is finding out now. So I can only assume OP chose this gf based on other qualities, and that this feature is not a dealbreaker for OP. So better communication it is.", "That's okay, neither did you", " But of course, if she wants to do a Color Run or some other crap in the future, know that's about the cute pictures and not about your finish time.", "Or holding you back because skip-galloping didn't work for him", "Your BF is a keeper!", "What did he make?

I\u2019ve seen one that was doughnut themed. One where they splash paint on you at various stations as you run by. A 5k with inflatable obstacles all along it - that was child friendly and maybe the most fun one ever. So many options!", "For real. Humans evolved to be distance runners and we\u2019ve been the best at it on earth for 200k years. Ancient humans would literally just follow prey till the animal collapsed from exhaustion then kill it with rocks at close range.

He should have realized they weren't on the same page as soon as she started talking about skip-galloping (which was clearly supposed to be funny) and comparing it to middle school gym class.", "It probably worked by making her teacher think she tried and was rightly exhausted after expending so much energy being ridiculous.", "Something like this probably. I have no idea the point of it but it seems to be a very niche and tiring thing lol. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/RnTlBjNsHFg", "I'm not watching anything that contradicts my mental image of OPs girlfriend running like Phoebe from friends", "Hahaha exactly what I saw in my head too. The level of delusion that it would work for 3+ miles also.", "oh I 100% agree she's being the AH.\n\nBut I can understand it, in her mind she's built it up as being a wonderful date day for them, and she feels rejected.  She's entirely wrong to feel that way, and needs to realise that she feels like that because she didn't make enough of an effort to understand what was actually going on and recognise how important it was to her BF.\n\nShe needs to sort it out though!", "Interesting, you are willing to say that a woman is incredibly stupid to the point of completely lacking common sense just so that you could shift the responsibility on a man.

That was my first 5k. \n\nWe also had a rollercoaster race where you ran 5k but then rode 5k of rollercoasters and that was a lot of fun!", "But what if those early humans skip-galloped after their prey? Perhaps she\u2019s rediscovered the best way to run. \n\nOr maybe she just doesn\u2019t get how running works.", "She should\u2019ve realised they\u2019re not on the same page when he told her his goals and she turned the whole thing into a joke.
