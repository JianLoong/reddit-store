No name, information, birthday, anything. I guess I wasn't a very cute kid, because I was never adopted. Then I went through a series of foster homes and the things that happened made me wish the US had actual orphanages, because at least workers are there for money, not whatever twisted fuckery they think is \"parenting.\"\n\nI grew up bitter and worked hard, desperate to prove myself on the off chance that they'd see and come back. When no one was there for high school graduation, I broke down. Then I let go of the resentment, but in order for that to happen, I also let go of ever wanting anything resembling parents.\n\nI went to college and then got into med school. Not because of a particular interest in medicine, but because no matter what happened, someone would always need a doctor. I fell in love with a classmate and we started dating. I never told her that I was an orphan, only telling her my parents were chronically absent (true) and someone else took care of me (also true).\n\nAfter two years of dating, she proposed the day after our graduation six months ago. I was so happy that I finally had physical evidence (and a rather expensive ring at that) showing I was worthy of being loved that I didn't remember parents are at weddings, so I'd need to tell her.\n\nWe matched at the same hospital where her family lived, so we moved in together there, and after the 12th unsolicited visit from her mother asking what our plans for the wedding was, I decided to tell my fiance in a probably crude way. I told her that my parents were chronically absent because I didn't know who they were and \"someone else\" was the foster homes. After asking a couple questions, she ran away to her parents to discuss my parentlessness, then they all came back for dinner.\n\nMy prospective MIL said that she and prospective FIL wanted me to think of them as my parents from now on and that she'd be my mother for the wedding. I thanked them but said I wasn't interested in having parents of any kind. But, she insisted, everyone should know a parent's love. I made a joke about a mouse in my research eating its baby. She pushed again and I said it'd be akin to stepsibling incest. Then PFIL slammed the table and yelled at me for not taking his wife or daughter seriously, and I snapped, telling them to get a grip and go find my parents if they wanted me to have them and God I hope they have better luck than I did. They shut up and left.\n\nLater, my fiance and I were going to the room they were holed up in to apologize and talk calmly, when we overheard them talking about the situation. They were really concerned...about what it would look like to Gramps if his granddaughter was marrying an orphan. See, that's the kind of thing I've come to expect from parents.\n\nBut my fiance is still upset and demanding to know what else I'm hiding from her. The answer is nothing, her parents and her gigantic family that won't fit in a damn farmhouse are obviously important to her but I never knew mine so this wasn't a huge secret, just something I didn't like talking about.\n\nAITA? or even if I am, is there anything else I could've done to get a better outcome?\n\nedit: I didn't want to talk about this because both my fiance and I don't like it but her family is very wealthy and I think from old money.

I was so happy that I finally had physical evidence (and a rather expensive ring at that) showing I was worthy of being loved\n\nThis is a pretty big red flag to me. It sounds like you truly haven't worked through your past abandonment issues and your comment about her money and now you had evidence that you were worthy of being loved. That's not how that works. Doesn't sound like you actually love yourself and are only in the idea of love.\n\nYou lied to your fianc\u00e9 all through dating? You really think that's a great way to start any marriage? Her family shouldn't have tried to swoop in, but I think in their own way they are trying to welcome you into the family and show that while you may not have bio parents, you are going to have a family who loves you.  You don't know what it actually means to be loved from parents or a family and even expect people to judge you for being an orphan. Yet you seem to be judgmental of her own family with your gigantic family comment. You are already setting yourself up for failure and if you keep this up, you will end up losing the two things you want: family and love.\n\nI think you need to get into therapy to work on your issues with being abandoned.", "You have to admit that you intentionally deceived her (aka lied) for a few years so if nothing else you are the A for that.\n\nYour future in laws were trying to do something nice for you but took it too far so they are As for that.\n\nWho the hell cares what grandpa thinks.\n\nThe one thing you are not an A for is wanting replacement parents. With what happened to you I don't think anyone could blame you.\n\nESH\n\nAlso, did your fianc\u00e9 give you an engagement ring too? Don't see that often.", "Therapy is your friend. I know that just sounds judgemental but for someone that says that being an orphan isn't a big deal, it seems like a huge fucking deal for you. I understand pushing shit down because what was your alternative? But you deceived your fiance, lies of omission are still lies. Her parents definitely overstepped; they were coming from a good place but should have backed off when they saw that the offer wasn't well received. YOU need to realize, IF and WHEN you marry this woman, those people WILL be your parents. They'll be your mother and father-in-law. They weren't offering anything that you didn't open yourself up for when you accepted this woman's proposal.", "First, it's reasonable for your fiancee to wonder what else you're hiding, they feel lied to because you didn't disclose a pretty important fact of your upbringing. But that doesn't make them or you TA\n\nYou two need to talk. You need them to understand that you're sensitive about it because of the stigma, and their parents words about their grandfather being upset about you being an orphan are evidence of this stigma. And you need to clear the air about the vague half-truths you allowed them to believe for your own reasons. You allowed your fiancee's innate assumptions deceive themselves, willingly. Not technically a lie, it also was not remotely the truth. \n\nThen, you and them, together need to approach the parents. They clearly share some stigma too, and while they would \"parent\" you, they seem to believe you need parents, despite (as it appears from your college career so far) you doing quite well without them. They need to address why this is important to them, and come to terms with what sounds at this point like an anti-orphan bias. They need to respect your desires to not have fake parents.", "Gentle gentlest of ESH. You should not have held something like this back from your fianc\u00e9e. And her mother, while I\u2019m sure somewhat good intentioned, should not have just immediately pushed to \u201cI\u2019ll be your mom.\u201d  Also gramps should worry about staying alive not about you being an orphan. What a ridiculous thing to be \u201cconcerned about.\u201d \n\nGunna be honest, you sound very angry at your parents. Which I would be too. Good on you for taking it as fuel to succeed in life, but as you move into this next chapter, you should consider trying to resolve this. Have you ever really spoken to anyone about your feelings on this? Have you ever told anyone else all of what youve written (and I\u2019m sure you have more to say)?  \n\nI know people always consider therapy the be all and end all, but at the very least it might be cathartic to talk to someone about how you really feel, and they may offer some insights that you\u2019ve never thought of before. Or let it out to your fianc\u00e9e. That\u2019s one of the cool things about having one, they want to listen to your thoughts and feelings. Good luck OP.", "I don't think you're ready to share your life with someone yet.\n\nIt's understandable you don't want a parental figure in your life, but that was an AH way of shutting down someone who could literally have no concept of what you've been through trying to tell you they want to support you and be your friend.\n\nYou need to work through your issues with some professional help.", "Keeping a secret only to end up telling them in a crude way wasn't the best way to approach this...but it sounds like you have so much resentment towards the lack of love from your birth parents that you are trying to sabotage any healthy relationships where people show you love.\n\nWhen they said they want you to think of them as parents, I think they were just trying to say \"let us show you the love you were missing\" and not that they actually wanted to become your parents. I think they would've meant it in a natural family or MIL/FIL type of way...although I can see how it saying \"think of us as your parents\" is kinda pushing a big boundary since they aren't your parents and wanting to be thought of like that would almost be more for them to feel good and less about you...and it sounds like that was kinda proven when your father in law slammed his arms down for not \"taking them seriously\" and later by saying they didn't like their daughter marrying an orphan. \n\nI can understand why your girlfriend wants to know what else you were hiding, as you were able to hide something big and all these overwhelming emotions fairly easily.\n\n> but I never knew mine so this wasn't a huge secret, just something I didn't like talking about.\n\nBut it sounds like it was more than you not wanting to talk about it, and instead something you purposefully kept from them and probably lied about since at some point the topic of conversation around parents/upbringing would've came up.\n\n>  is there anything else I could've done to get a better outcome?\n\nMaybe by saying you can accept them as parent in laws who are loving, but aren't comfortable thinking of them as your own parents. Idk...it's a difficult situation.\n\nESH (except your fianc\u00e9).", "ESH, except probably your fiance. Her parents were absolutely overbearing and pushed your boundaries hard before you snapped.

YTA \n\nYou intentionally deceived the person you wanted to spend the rest of your life with and then mocked her parents when they (albeit a little overbearingly) tried to show compassion.", "YTA cuz of your BS story.", "I say ESH except maybe your fiance. \n\nYour vague incomplete answers were the same as lying to someone you love and plan to share a life with.   I can see why she had trust issues now. \n\nHer parents can't expect to just instantly be considered your parents.   Over time you might develop a parent like relationship with them but that kind of thing doesn't just instantly happen because someone announces it at dinner one night.", "Fake", "YTA - and I hate saying that.\n\nI understand this topic is hard for you, that it's not something you like to share, and those feelings are completely valid.\n\nHowever, you're marrying this girl, and when your relationship is that deep, you two should have discussed your past in more detail, and probably before engagement.  The fact that even after engagement, it took numerous inquiries...well, I'm not surprised she thinks you may be hiding other things.\n\nThat said, her parents, being concerned about what it will look like if their daughter marries an orphan?  They are also AH.  How your fiance handles them will tell you plenty about if you should proceed with the wedding.", "YTA: this is information you should have told her long ago. Your aggression towards the situation makes me wonder if therapy is something you, and you and your SO should be having.", "ESH. You for lying and cracking mildly inappropriate jokes instead of firmly but politely stating that you\u2019re more interested in a traditional in-law relationship (I\u2019m from a medical family, and that dark humor stunts the hell out of adult conversation if you let it). Them obviously for being pushy and pearl clutching. Have you completed any therapy related to your abandonment trauma?", "YTA - you seem to defined yourself as an orphan as it is your personality instead of a fact. You lied about it (and particularly something as important to you) to the one who stated and showed wanting to tied their life with yours, and be a family with you.

This can be explained by your own insecurities and issues, however it was indeed rude the way you adamantly rejected their attempts to welcome you as family. You might not understand it from your upbringing, however you should try to understand it was their way to accept you as you are and show they were willing to offer what you lacked. \n\nYou could have kept it to thank but not looking to compensate.

It's the fact that you kept up the impression that there were people there who weren't. This is your truth, yes, and it sounds like it hurts you a lot still. But it's a huge thing to keep from the person you want to spend your life with.\n\nHow about couple counseling for you both to sort through this? \n\nIt's startling news, and not necessarily that they're upset that you are an orphan. Work with your partner. Use words and share what it's been like, share your thoughts on it, your boundaries.", "YTA, \n\nYou've had a life very few people could relate to. All your decisions are driven by that pain. Your fiance is right to feel hurt, you hid such a huge part of you that how can she help but feel deceived and wonder what else your hiding. The issue isn't that you never knew your family. The issue is that you lied to her about it. Yeah saying you were abandoned by your parents isn't first date conversation if you don't want it to be.  But around time you saw a future with her was probably about the time to share some of that information. \n\nYou want a better outcome? You need to be more open with your future wife. That doesn't necessarily mean breaking all barriers in 2 days, but it means having those uncomfortable conversations and telling her when it gets to real that you need a break.", "ESH- You lied to your partner about something important for way too long.

She dumped me immediately, saying she wasn't ready for a relationship (but was curiously with another boyfriend 2 weeks later). Ok, maybe we weren't close enough to warrant that level of weight which I acknowledge is a lot. The second time, I waited until I thought things were serious and I thought I could trust her, and I told her. She was suspicious of what else I was hiding, and every interaction after that was laced with pity. \"It's so impressive that you're able to do that, I could never.\" The point was that I thrived in spite of not having parents, not that I want a god damn handicap because I didn't have them. I got so sick of it (and yes, I did communicate this because the relationship was no longer felt like it was between equals) that I dumped her shortly after that.\n\nSo I just stopped providing details.
