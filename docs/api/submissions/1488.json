Prior to speaking to the prof, I would approach Jimothy again about the confounds and explain how detrimental they are to the results, and how harmful it could be to a future career in this field (if this is, in fact, his intended field of work) to have a flawed study out there.  I am not in the same field, but I am a law student, and law review articles can come back to haunt attorneys years later and undermine their credibility (and even the perception of their morality and ethics).  \n\nIf he still doesn\u2019t take you seriously, YWNBTA if you speak to the prof if, and only if, it is motivated by helping Jimothy. If you\u2019re doing it out of a sheer sense of control and scratching the itch your own pet peeve, you lose some moral high ground IMHO.  \n\nThat having been said, it might serve him well to just let him flounder and, consequently, to learn a lesson from his refusal to implement the changes.", "For someone feeling the need to stress that none if this is your business you really have a tendency to go on tangents about how your entire life demands you get I solved.\n\nYTA. Leave it between him and his professor. If the professor didn't spot anything wrong then it's fine, even if what you say is accurate it's unlikely anything would go wrong because of it.\n\nAlso for someone who promises to explain confounds you never explained them.", "YTA. Stay in your lane.", "YWBTH.", "YWNBTA\n\nThe potential detrimental snowball that could arise from this study being published and built upon ultimately effects far more people than just Jimothy. I think that especially given your intended career and goals, it is understandable for you to address the issue. \n\nThat said, I would go back to Jimothy and stress the issues that have been bothering you, and the outcomes that will follow. Stress the impact on his career, and also on future patients that could be treated based on biased data. You can be kind and gentle about it while still getting across the point that the study as it stands has a serious flaw. \n\nIf he disregards you again, that is when I would mention it to the professor so that they could try to address it before submission.", "YWNBTA because imo, this is about scientific integrity, and ultimately about research that could affect the lives of many people.\n\nYour friend specifically asked you to look for problems, yes? It sounds like you found a pretty damn big problem.\n\nAt some point this isn't about him anymore, it's about the people who will be negatively affected by inaccurate research being published on a topic that could literally be the difference between life and death.\n\nIf he's unwilling to address the problems you've found, *and* you can be 100% sure that this will negatively impact the mental health of people who this study would affect, then I think it becomes your duty to say something.\n\neta: I see that it wouldn't affect his grade but frankly, if it's a choice between saving a life or tanking a friend's grade, I wouldn't blink anyway.", "You did as Jimothy asked and piloted his survey, you gave him the feedback he asked for. What he didn't ask for is for you to step out of the lane he asked you to be in and go run to his professor and tattle. So yes, YWBTA. \n\nLet his professor do his job and go through Jimothy's work with Jimothy.", "NTA. But only if your intentions are based solely in the name of good science.", "Actually I can be certain it would not affect his grade. Marking is done at the end, and research is collaborative. Mistakes along the way that get addressed are part of the process.\n\nETA: I also know the professor well enough to know she shares this view", "it\u2019s basically something else that could be affecting your dependent variable that isn\u2019t your independent variable. \n\nsomething like if i were to say \u201cmore drownings have occurred in the summer! summer causes drownings!!\u201d. well no, the fact that nobody swims in the winter is a confound. there\u2019s inherently going to be more drownings in the summer because there\u2019s going to be more people swimming. \n\nso it negates your findings because what you\u2019ve found doesn\u2019t actually go to any causation between the dependent and the independent variable.", "I mean, maybe going to the professor is too far, but it\u2019s definitely not none of their business. He asked them to pilot the study and give feedback.", "I didn't explain confounds because of word limits on posts, and frankly I doubt most Redditors care. But since you asked I'll give you the short of it\n\nBasically, in any experimental psychological study, you manipulate a single variable  (IV) and test to see the if manipulating that variable will affect whatever you're measuring, called the dependent variable (DV). You can technically have just one of each, but most studies will have multiple.\n\nThe theory behind the method is that if two simulations are run from the same set of initial criteria, the simulations should end the same. If you change only one thing in one of the simulations, and the end result is different, it's safe to say that the manipulation *caused* the difference in the end result. This is actually the foundation of all science, not just psychology.\n\nThis is easy to do in many fields, but very difficult in psychology, since it's impossible to make any set of circumstances involving humans identical across two scenarios. There will always be variability, as a result, but this is okay as long as the variability is the same across IV groups.\n\nA confound exists when something that is not the IV is different across the two groups systematically. For instance, if I wanted to test response times after administering a drug,  I'd need an experimental group and a control. However, if every participant in the experimental group was also tired, since the study was conducted in the late evening, while the controls were tested in the morning, that would affect the DV (response time) systematically across the two groups, thus the difference in response times, if one was found, couldn't be proven to be due to the drug: maybe the experimental group was just tired, and the drug had no effect. In this way, confounds directly attack the credibility of research\n\nIn that example, if the authors didn't note the time of day that the research was conducted, the study could easily be published and no reader could identify the confound. This is the position I'm in, and why I care so much", "So Jimothy wants help until someone tells him he made a mistake? That\u2019s a terrible leader, friend, scientist, etc.", "It really is! Like, this is the field I'm looking to go into. I think a lot of \"stay in your lane\" people don't get that with my career goals, this is my lane. Huge numbers of psychological studies have turned out to be crap because people don't spend enough time agonizing over methodology or make claims with unstated assumptions. It's even got a name: The Replication Crisis\". \n\nThe purpose of someone with my career goals is to resolve these issues, preferably before they happen. In this case, I do like Jimothy's study, and it has potential to benefit the field. But as it is, it would do more harm than good, and frankly I don't trust the publication vetting process since just last year I conducted a study that failed to replicate, and the study was published in an esteemed journal only four years ago. Clearly things aren't working.", "Pretty much. I gave another example of a confound in another comment, just a bit more thorough and in the context of a psych study"]}
