Recently we have bought a house together to start a family. It has a beautiful garden and is overall quite spacious.\n\nMy Husband, lets call him Paul and his best friend Ethan have known each other since elementary school and are very close. Ethan hadnt had any relationships during the whole time that I have known him. Apparently this is quite rough on him, so my husband decided that he would host a party for him at our house and asked me to invite all my single girlfriends and they were to invite their single friends as well.\n\nTo be honest, I really did not want to have a party in our home especially with me being 7 months pregnant. But I relented and said fine because I thought it could be fun to meet my friends and get my mind of things. We chose a date for the party and invited our friends. An estimated amount of around 30 people (mostly women) would be attending. Even though I am pregnant and can not drink, I offered my husband that I could be making cocktails for the guests, as this is something that I think is fun and I like making mocktails for myself as well. He kinda looked at me weird and said. \"Well, who else would be making them?\"  Which threw me off a bit, as this was his event and not mine. I took the moment to ask him if he had called a caterer or how he would be feeding the guests to which he gave me a look and replied by saying. \"I thought you were going to cook.\" \nI was sure I wasnt hearing clearly so I asked him again and got the same answer as before. I told him that there was absolutely no way I was going to feed 30+ people and that he should either order food or make it himself. He told me that he was too busy with party planning and work and had no time and that I should just be making appetizers instead, as people would be mostly drinking anyways.  I told him that I would not be doing that, as my pregnancy has been hard on me and I didnt think I had it in me. He told me to just try and I said no and told him that he should call catering before it was too late.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks and he has not called  catering and told me that I had to make the appetizers as it was too late now anyway. It made me incredibly upset and I told him that I was going to be canceling the party because at this point it was stressing me out too much. \nHe called me selfish and told me to quit being such an asshole and to just do something nice for his friend who is struggeling. I do feel bad for lashing out on my husband and wonder if I exaggerated. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689615916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1528pnj/aita_for_wanting_to_cancel_the_party_that_my/", "score": 4644, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean, he even states that his job is the party planning. Usually party planning includes food, drink, and entertainment. If you are doing the drinks and expected to do the food, then what exactly is his part in this?\n\nCancel it or tell him to get the BBQ out and get grilling cause you're making cocktails and socialising with your friends.", "NTA\nHe assumed you would cook and make drinks because you\u2019re a woman not because he\u2019s \u2018too busy\u2019. Nip this in the bud now or you\u2019ll be doing everything for the baby. It takes next to no effort to order in a few pizzas, let him do it.", "NTA at all.\n\nThink about whether you want to continue to raise a child in this dreadful, misogynistic marriage. Get a hotel or stay with a friend during this weekend. You shouldn't be exposed to stress this weekend while 7 months pregnant. Text your girlfriends and tell them about the situation; I bet they won't come. He can buy some pizzas for his friends.", "Wow, what a prick your husband is. NTA.", "NTA - this whole party was his idea. You are 7 months pregnant and even cooking for a party of 10 people is a lot. You asked him to plan ahead and he didn't. You are not his caterer or his maid  but if the party happens I bet he'd expect you to be both.", "NTA. Your husband isn't throwing the party. He just came up with the idea for the party - a sort of a poor man's The Bachelor actually. \n\nYOU are throwing the party. Cancel the girls. Tell hubby to change the date when he has the catering and bartending and clean-up worked out and you'll re-invite your friends. But it'll have to be at least 6 months after the baby is born and NOT at your house.", "NTA but have Ethan come make the food.   Raises his potential value as a future partner to the single ladies. Gets your hubby out of his own way for not being considerate to you and gives you a chance to not have to worry about the food.. and don't consult hubby first before putting into action", "Do your girlfriends realize this is essentially a cattle call for the benefit of hubby\u2019s friend? Personally I would be insulted when I found out.", "NTA. Holy moly! Your gem of a husband volunteered you, a heavily pregnant woman, to cater a party that's basically for the benefit of his friend. This sounds like an awful reality show. If your current husband is busy with party planning, I'd assume that means invitations, decor (enough seats/tables), drinks and food; expecting you to take care of the bulk of this sounds like a 1950s life. With this sort of attitude to both you and all the women he's essentially throwing in a pond so his friend can go fishing, I'm guessing he will never even change a diaper.", "\" I do feel bad for lashing out on my husband and wonder if I exaggerated.\"\n\nDont feel bad. You didnt exaggerate.\n\nI love cooking, but if someone TOLD me i was cooking as an afterthought without asking, then they would get a mouthful. And there is no way I would do it.\n\nHowever, you are heavily pregnant, which in itself is a perfectly good reason not to even entertain the idea.\n\nThat he said \"Well, who else would be making them?\" about the cokctails strongly suggests he takes you for granted.\n\nYou have done him an enormous (and possibly unwise) favour allowing him to have the party at your house in the first place, given your pregnancy.\n\nHe needs to give his head a shake and you need to start thinking ahead. If he like this before the baby is even born, what is he going to be like afterwards?\n\nIn the instance that you dont cancel the party, I really dont think you should cook. Im not even sure about the cocktail thing tbh.\n\nHe is massively taking advantage and favouring his friend over his pregnant wife.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nINFO: Does your husband drive a pimpmobile?", "NTA.  Girl......I feel for you when you have this baby.", "Husband has succeeded in turning you into his friend\u2019s almost pimp. \n\nLet that sink in and save the women at this farce of a party the hardship of turning him down. \n\nCancel.

Tons of restaurants do things like that with just a few hours notice, and worst case scenario, he goes to the grocery store and buys some party platters and drops out some cheese, meat, veg, and dip.  \n\nThis shouldn't be more than an hour of work to arrange to get some apps to show up.", "NTA - If your husband wanted to do something nice for his friend then he should have done it. Instead he expected you to do it  without asking....and then tried to force you to do it after you said no by purposely not calling a  caterer for two  whole weeks.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\" and asked me to invite all my single girlfriends and they were to invite their single friends as well.\" .. Agreeing to THIS makes you an AH, too. --  **You were an AH to invite your single friends to let Ethan creep on them. So you supplied the girls to feed Ethan's urges, why not the food and the cocktails, too? Did you at least warn your friends what you had planned them for?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd reconsider the relationship. Why are you with that AH. HE is certainbly treating you and the other girls as objects good for work and sex - but **Paul certainly DOES NOT consider you a partner, and definitely not his equal. He gets angry when you balk at his orders.**", "NTA. No way in hell you should be getting saddled with all the work.", "WTF", "Nta\nYour husband is incredible inconsiderate.", "wow your  husband cares more about his bff than you and doesnt care about the fact your about to have his child.  i would pack up and go somewhere for a week to de stress and think about things", "NTA - If you are inviting the guests, planning and making the cocktails, and planning and making the food - what exactly falls under his job of \"party planning\" that is so time consuming?", "Cancel it without hesitation.  You're not getting the assistance that you should be and quite frankly the premise is just odd.  Your husband wants to have a singles mixer for his friend.... why are you and your dh responsible for fixing this dude's love life?", "NTA, its his friend let him do the work or cancel & hes a big AH for calling you selfish & an asshole, i\u2019d cancel after that.", "He sounds like an ah from another realm. Petty me thinks you should make gross or joke snacks. Like invisible cupcakes or smoked air or just a table with a can opener and lots of cans next to a microwave.", "NTA and I would conveniently be spending the night somewhere else for the party!", "NTA. Cancel it.", "NTA. But this is a perfect example of why a relationship needs good communication in order to thrive. Hubby wants to throw a big party. First question should've been: \"What about the food?\" Hubby would've then said: \"I thought YOU were gonna do the cooking.\" To which you're immediate answer would've been: \"Guess again, Pal.\" The two of you could've decided at that point which hill to die on. Now the party date is coming up and you two haven't even settled this. Cook if you want, order pizza or chinese food if you don't want to cook. But let this be a lesson in Communication Skills 101 for future reference.", "NTA. \n\nSo not only are you not an AH and should definitely not be cooking or doing anything further for this party, but you also need a sit down with your husband to clear some things up before this baby gets here. \n\n1. He shouldn't EVER expect you to be hosting things he wants to do. If he wants to have people over or do a day activity or anything like that, he should actively be planning it and including you on what he might need from you. You are about to have a child together, he can't be like \"we should do a beach day\" and then day of, just be sitting by the car with nothing packed. \n2. He is busy with party planning, but has no menu or cocktails...WTF is he even planning? And the reason I put this is because if he is SOOOO overwhelmed by \"planning\" for a party where he feels no responsibility for the two things people actually care about, he is going to be a tough partner once that baby comes. \n3. The way he spoke to you is inappropriate. You were clear that you didn't want this party because of your energy level, and he proceeded to ignore that, not by having the party, but by expecting you to do all the labor intensive work. When you said no, he called you names. He needs to fully own and apologize for that. \n4. Be clear this isn't happening again. You aren't going to be less tired once the baby gets here, so he needs to get his shit together and act like a partner and an adult. \n\nNo party for sad friend.", "You know he is the AH, he can do the apetizers for HIS friend.", "NTA. You are 7 months pregnant and his *isn't your party*. It's also not your problem that his best friend can't get a girlfriend. If he wants to throw a mixer for his friend, then *he* should throw a mixer. You were generous to even offer to make cocktails. Your husband is TA and needs to start treating you with respect or you should get out before the baby comes and you're stuck with him telling you he's *too busy* for late night feeding and nappy changes", "Eww for the party pimp idea.", "NTA. His friends + his planned event\u2026 he can do the work. He doesn\u2019t get to just order you around.  You\u2019ve told him no, and he\u2019s not listening. He can go to Costco or the local grocery store and pick up frozen appies to serve. \n\nThis also doesn\u2019t bode well though for how the division of labor will be handled after your little one arrives.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good luck!", "NGL. This is going to go one of two ways. 1) Your friends will assume the party is a final hurrah before you have a baby. They'll ignore your husband's friend, and he'll mope all night. Your husband will probably be upset that you didn't push them at his friend. 2) Your friends realize it's a weird harem party to get this guy a date/laid and they're uncomfortable. Your friends will probably drift away if they realize this.", "> My friends all know that this is a party for singles.\n\nDo they think it's  party for singles where the women all have multiple men to pick from, or do they know it's supposed to be basically a parade of women for a single guy to pick from and attempt to hit on... a guy who hasn't managed to date at all in years so probably has either serious anxiety, or L rizz.\n\nBecause inviting 10 single guys, 10 single girls is one thing, but inviting 30 single straight women and one straight guy is fucking weird and as I guy I absolutely wouldn't want to be that one guy either.", "Ahaha. No, no, no.\n\nPregnancy IS hard. We all know this. It's a gruelling process for the mother. Yes, it can screw with your emotions and make you act in ways you otherwise wouldn't, however:\n\nPlease don't start second guessing or doubting yourself. I'd be unhappy hosting a party that size with a bunch of people I don't know, and I'm not capable of being pregnant, since...well, I'm male xD\n\nThe way he just expected you to play front of house/catering/presumably cleaning after while heavily pregnant shows a huge lack of respect towards you, and the way you're talking about not trusting yourself sounds like being disregarded/put down/gaslit. I hope this isn't the case.\n\nLove yourself first and foremost and do not doubt your instincts - pregnant or not.\n\nNTA. Seriously.", ">When my husband first brought this party up the thought behind it did make me feel a bit icky but my emotions are all over the place atm so I dont really trust myself.\n\nTrust yourself.  My brain was screaming \"red alert\" before you even got to organising the party.  There's a reason your husband's friend has been single for so long and it's not because he's not looking.  Don't subject your friends to this guy.  And if you do, expect scope-creep.  First it's the party, then it's bullying a friend into going on a date with him, then it's trying to push them into a relationship and you getting blamed and punished when she says no.  Trust me - he'll still be single after the party, but now it will be your fault.", "Oh boy\u2026 is he putting the same effort to make friends being invited as calling the caterer?\n\nTime to bow out.  Telll your girlfriends the truth and go get a pedicure during the party or schedule a hair cut or an oil change.  But don\u2019t be there!\n\nHis lack of respect is mind boggling!  So, let him throw a party for his friend\u2026 his monkey, his circus!", "It's not your pregnancy. This is a really weird thing your husband is pulling.\n\nTrust your instincts here, and cancel the party. Also ask your husband why the F he's stressing you out at 7 months pregnant. You guys should be preparing for the birth of your kid, not trying to get his friend a date.  \n\n\nETA: NTA", "You're an asshole for setting your friends up to be this man's persnal.meay marketm hiw gross if you and your husband. You don't deserve friends for how little you think of them that's you'd do this to them.", "I'd be seriously pissed off if I was seven months pregnant when I found out my husband was a pimp.\n\nJust. . .ick.", "This whole concept sounds horrible... and a little dangerous.", ">My friends all know that this is a party for singles.\n\n>mostly he just told me that if so and so has time, they will come. \n\n....sounds to me like virtually none of the guys will show, and even if they do, the party will be *wildly skewed* towards a few guys and a ton of single women for them to gawk at and act like they're picking one, \"Bachelor\" style.\n\nDo these women know that the entire point of the party from the get-go was essentially \"Find Ethan A Girlfriend\"? Because that's very different from a \"singles party\" and if I found that out after the fact, that you let your husband and his friend see me as a prop to make Ethan feel better about himself, and you knew that from the beginning and didn't tell me? I'd be super angry, and it would be the end of the friendship. \n\nReal talk, the SECOND my husband started talking about inviting all my single friends (and their single friends) over so his buddy could get laid on the regular, I'd have shut that shit down *immediately* and unless I got an extremely profuse apology in the next minute or so, I'd have been packing a bag. \n\nThat reeks of Ethan feeling like he's *entitled* to a girlfriend, and your husband agreeing with him... which... is not how it works if you see women as people instead of objects to bump up the male ego.\n\nBecause the kind of person who thinks about women that way is not someone I want to spend my life with.\n\n...and you can see it in the way he's treated you through this whole thing. \n\nHe expected you to wait on everyone and make/serve drinks. (Even if you weren't pregnant, that's a huge thing to expect from someone without asking, and not ok.) He expected you to cook for 30+ people, even after you'd had a conversation about not expecting labor from you. And then he chose to weaponize his incompetence and refuse to order catering (or cook himself) so that he could try to force you to do it yourself because \"now there's no time\". \n\nThere would have been time if he'd decided not to be an asshole. \n\nAnd there's still time for him to go to the grocery store and pick up $200 worth of pre-made apps and snacks there. Which is still cheaper than the catering would be. But he won't, because he expects you to do what he says, and jump when he snaps his fingers. \n\nA lot of women find out the hard way that their long-time partners change when they get pregnant, because suddenly the woman is \"locked down\" now and she can't leave as easily. I'd look long and hard at all his behavior patterns, and decide NOW if this is someone you want raising and influencing your child. \n\nI think you're NTA for cancelling the party, but I wanna say a soft 'y t a' for letting it go on as long as it did.", "I'm really concerned about how your husband is treating you. It sounds like at a bare minimum, he's really taking you for granted and being remarkably unsympathetic about a difficult pregnancy. Being pregnant is actually dangerous, even in this modern age. You need to rest and keep your life as stress-free as possible in order to conserve your energy for the dual task of growing a new life inside of you, and surviving the process. I don't mean to alarm you, but that is genuinely what you're looking at here. Now, women also survive difficult pregnancies plenty often, especially with modern medicine, but the odds of things going horribly wrong are not zero. Your focus needs to be on yourself at this time.\n\nI also find it a bit concerning that he even thinks this party idea is appropriate. Has he considered whether or not these women are interested in going to this party just to meet one dude? Has he thought about their feelings? I'm worried because it seems like he might have a pattern of not considering women's feelings, including yours. I'm also concerned that you're at a place right now, mentally and emotionally, where you are ignoring your very correct instincts about this party. I've never been pregnant, so I don't know what it's like, but surely there's a difference between being skeptical of your mood swings and ignoring how you feel about what is, at its core, a pretty skeevy plan to \"get this guy a girlfriend.\" And btw, I don't think it's going to work. I think the women are all going to be very weirded out by this setup, alarm bells are going to start ringing in their heads (just like they're currently ringing in mine), and the vast majority are going to find excuses to leave early.\n\nI don't wish to alarm you, but please be aware that a lot of men will wait until their partner is pregnant to show their true colors. The fact that he's asking all this of you could just be ignorance, since a lot of men don't really understand that pregnancy is still *dangerous* in this day and age, but it could be something more sinister as well. Considering the company he keeps, I'm honestly a little worried. Keep an eye out for those red flags, okay?", "That was my thought. Ethan sounds like an incel. OPs hubby sounds like an incel that accidentally got married.", "If Ethan does neither, well, maybe we\u2019re starting to get a picture of why he\u2019s single\u2026", "People aren't Barbie and Ken dolls - what your husband is doing feels gross and invasive. If Ethan isn't ready to be dating, he's not ready. People don't need to be paired off - if he's being shy in dates, it's unlikely to be his time yet. But he may want to do so, so he can get used to dating again. And hey, it may still work out. \n\nSounds like your husband is arranging this party because he feels like Ethan should be paired off and he is about as empathetic as a rock and doesn't care about the guests as people. I suspect he just wants a Barbie to go with his Ken because he thinks that will make his friend happy. But life doesn't really work like that. If Ethan expressed interest in meeting more people and getting out there it would make sense to take him places where there will be eligible singles. But having a eligible bachelor party is just creepy and weird. A singles party without focus on one person *may* make sense, but this is just... ew.", "Yeah, the party sounds like a strange attempt at the Bachelorette. If Ethan hasn't been seeing anyone in all that time (and if doesn't sound like by choice), I'm kind of wondering if there's a reason for that...", "She's going to be the one cleaning the house before and after the party,  bartending,  cooking,  and most likely tending to guests. Her husband has done nothing but invite the 1 creepy dude that can't get laid, there's no other men invited.  This is gross and misogynistic.", "\"Are you really into hosting what is essentially an auction to find a date for Ethan? If he needs this to get a date he doesn't deserve one.\"\n\n\nThis is something I find pretty creepy. This guy can't get a date so a bunch of women are being tricked into playing a speedrun version of the batchelor,  but with a loser who can't talk to women.  I guarantee that OP's husband intends for his buddy to be the only guy at this party that he's manipulated his wife into throwing and doing all the work.", "He thought giving permission meant she signed up to do everything. Why wouldn't she? She is female!\n\nAll women automatically know how to whip up dinner for 30! It's a skill born into us and bartending is the LEAST she could do for him after only planning the menu, shopping, cooking, and cleaning. I mean, he's EXHAUSTED from having to tell her what to do to throw a party. It used a whole 10 brain cells and one statement that she's the caterer. Now, he deserves a break for all of his party-planning effort so why is she denying him this hookup party for him and his friend? She's so selfish and controlling! I'm sure it's because of her hormones! Who's wife wouldn't want to bartend sober so everyone else could get trashed and hookup?", "And she did the inviting.", "yogurt and onion dip .. and chips! Boom!", "This. He's doing nothing on purpose to make OP feel like she has no choice but to comply.\n\nBut OP, you have choices. Cancel the party and then honestly get into counseling ASAP because if you're expecting your first child together and he's pulling this bullshit already it sounds like you may be in for a rough time.", "Nope, I'm tired of people asking this. Why is it the wife's fault her husband is a shitty person? Blame him.", "God I fucking hate this.\n\n*People do not show all their red flags in the beginning of a relationship.*\n\nHow is it 2023 and we still don't fucking understand this?\n\nHer *husband* is being the obvious prick here and it's still somehow her fault for not properly reading her mystical crystal ball. Fuck off with this victim-blaming bullshit.", "He's planning ways to manipulate his pregnant wife into doing all the work while he gets the credit", "Based on how gross husband appears to be, wouldn't surprise me if friend was a bit of an incel... if that's the case, creeps are gonna creep no matter what party you put them in. Women should never entertain men who hate them.", "Great idea! Husband can make the cocktails himself, he can order pizzas and breadsticks. Add chips and salsa if he wants to be fancy. I think serving alcoholic drinks without much food is a terrible idea (but I got arrested for being drunk and disorderly the last time I drank on an empty stomach so maybe I'm biased lol). She can rest and not even attend the party if she wants to.\n\nI tend to side with the commenter who said the entire idea is a bit weird. Unless there is a decent amount of single men attending as well, it's like she's serving her single friends up on a platter without their knowledge.", "THIS. People can be great at hiding. My friend of 25 years hid the fact that she was a covert narcissist. It wasn't until I was staying with her and her family that I realized it. She was so good at hiding.", "Grocery stores and wholesale clubs (Costco, Sam\u2019s) sell prepared food and snack trays.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He'll be dry humping all the single ladies until he finds one that doesn't slug him!", "Yet her initial post says \u201c30 people (mostly women)\u201d, so it\u2019s a ratio seriously skewed to the mens\u2019 benefit, so still creepy.", "How expensive is the pizza you order?!", "And, the incubator.", "Since her initial post says \u201c30 people (mostly women)\u201d, the ratio is still really skewed, having a few more single men than Ethan doesn\u2019t dial down the ick factor all that much.", "It's so weird that he just expected her to cook. I've been cooking for myself and my partner pretty much every day for two years now and he still never *expects* me to cook. Add in that OP is pregnant and like wtf is her husband's problem?!?", "He is either an idiot or an AH if he consider her doing all the work for even a moment.", "Nice guy vibes", "This is perfect, and I hope OP sees your comment.", "Sadly, it sounds like he values his friend over his wife. \ud83d\ude41"]}
