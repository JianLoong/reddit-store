Recently we have bought a house together to start a family. It has a beautiful garden and is overall quite spacious.\n\nMy Husband, lets call him Paul and his best friend Ethan have known each other since elementary school and are very close. Ethan hadnt had any relationships during the whole time that I have known him. Apparently this is quite rough on him, so my husband decided that he would host a party for him at our house and asked me to invite all my single girlfriends and they were to invite their single friends as well.\n\nTo be honest, I really did not want to have a party in our home especially with me being 7 months pregnant. But I relented and said fine because I thought it could be fun to meet my friends and get my mind of things. We chose a date for the party and invited our friends. An estimated amount of around 30 people (mostly women) would be attending. Even though I am pregnant and can not drink, I offered my husband that I could be making cocktails for the guests, as this is something that I think is fun and I like making mocktails for myself as well. He kinda looked at me weird and said. \"Well, who else would be making them?\"  Which threw me off a bit, as this was his event and not mine. I took the moment to ask him if he had called a caterer or how he would be feeding the guests to which he gave me a look and replied by saying. \"I thought you were going to cook.\" \nI was sure I wasnt hearing clearly so I asked him again and got the same answer as before. I told him that there was absolutely no way I was going to feed 30+ people and that he should either order food or make it himself. He told me that he was too busy with party planning and work and had no time and that I should just be making appetizers instead, as people would be mostly drinking anyways.  I told him that I would not be doing that, as my pregnancy has been hard on me and I didnt think I had it in me. He told me to just try and I said no and told him that he should call catering before it was too late.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks and he has not called  catering and told me that I had to make the appetizers as it was too late now anyway. It made me incredibly upset and I told him that I was going to be canceling the party because at this point it was stressing me out too much. \nHe called me selfish and told me to quit being such an asshole and to just do something nice for his friend who is struggeling. I do feel bad for lashing out on my husband and wonder if I exaggerated. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689615916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1528pnj/aita_for_wanting_to_cancel_the_party_that_my/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because if you\u2019re just inviting your friends to be picked over like produce at a grocery store and they have no idea, I\u2019d be pretty mad at you if I were one of your single friends.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being an AH. I mean, he even states that his job is the party planning. Usually party planning includes food, drink, and entertainment. If you are doing the drinks and expected to do the food, then what exactly is his part in this?\n\nCancel it or tell him to get the BBQ out and get grilling cause you're making cocktails and socialising with your friends.", "NTA\nHe assumed you would cook and make drinks because you\u2019re a woman not because he\u2019s \u2018too busy\u2019. Nip this in the bud now or you\u2019ll be doing everything for the baby. It takes next to no effort to order in a few pizzas, let him do it.", "NTA at all.\n\nThink about whether you want to continue to raise a child in this dreadful, misogynistic marriage. Get a hotel or stay with a friend during this weekend. You shouldn't be exposed to stress this weekend while 7 months pregnant. Text your girlfriends and tell them about the situation; I bet they won't come. He can buy some pizzas for his friends.", "Wow, what a prick your husband is. NTA.", "NTA - this whole party was his idea. You are 7 months pregnant and even cooking for a party of 10 people is a lot. You asked him to plan ahead and he didn't. You are not his caterer or his maid  but if the party happens I bet he'd expect you to be both.", "NTA. Your husband isn't throwing the party. He just came up with the idea for the party - a sort of a poor man's The Bachelor actually. \n\nYOU are throwing the party. Cancel the girls. Tell hubby to change the date when he has the catering and bartending and clean-up worked out and you'll re-invite your friends. But it'll have to be at least 6 months after the baby is born and NOT at your house.", "NTA but have Ethan come make the food.   Raises his potential value as a future partner to the single ladies. Gets your hubby out of his own way for not being considerate to you and gives you a chance to not have to worry about the food.. and don't consult hubby first before putting into action", "Do your girlfriends realize this is essentially a cattle call for the benefit of hubby\u2019s friend? Personally I would be insulted when I found out.", "NTA. Holy moly! Your gem of a husband volunteered you, a heavily pregnant woman, to cater a party that's basically for the benefit of his friend. This sounds like an awful reality show. If your current husband is busy with party planning, I'd assume that means invitations, decor (enough seats/tables), drinks and food; expecting you to take care of the bulk of this sounds like a 1950s life. With this sort of attitude to both you and all the women he's essentially throwing in a pond so his friend can go fishing, I'm guessing he will never even change a diaper.", "\" I do feel bad for lashing out on my husband and wonder if I exaggerated.\"\n\nDont feel bad. You didnt exaggerate.\n\nI love cooking, but if someone TOLD me i was cooking as an afterthought without asking, then they would get a mouthful. And there is no way I would do it.\n\nHowever, you are heavily pregnant, which in itself is a perfectly good reason not to even entertain the idea.\n\nThat he said \"Well, who else would be making them?\" about the cokctails strongly suggests he takes you for granted.\n\nYou have done him an enormous (and possibly unwise) favour allowing him to have the party at your house in the first place, given your pregnancy.\n\nHe needs to give his head a shake and you need to start thinking ahead. If he like this before the baby is even born, what is he going to be like afterwards?\n\nIn the instance that you dont cancel the party, I really dont think you should cook. Im not even sure about the cocktail thing tbh.\n\nHe is massively taking advantage and favouring his friend over his pregnant wife.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nINFO: Does your husband drive a pimpmobile?", "NTA.  Girl......I feel for you when you have this baby.", "Husband has succeeded in turning you into his friend\u2019s almost pimp. \n\nLet that sink in and save the women at this farce of a party the hardship of turning him down. \n\nCancel. Nta", "NTA for wanting to cancel, but your friends are being pimped out to a grown man bc he has no game of his own?!? Also what party planning is taking up your \u201chusband\u2019s\u201d time? Quotes bc I\u2019m not sure he deserves that title.", "NTA. Your husband wanted to assemble a harem of single girlfriends to make his buddy feel better?", "NTA.  Tell him to strap on 20lbs on weight around his middle then attempt make food for 30+ people, and see how it would work for him.  Tell him to order a bunch of pizza, and wings then be done with it.", "NTA tell him you've put this party on the back burner and let him figure it out", "NTA\n\nIf you had to invite most of the female guests, and were expected to make the food and drinks, what \u201cparty planning\u201d was your husband too busy with to order food?", "NTA, but it is never too late for catering, especially if it is just supposed to be heavy apps.  Tons of restaurants do things like that with just a few hours notice, and worst case scenario, he goes to the grocery store and buys some party platters and drops out some cheese, meat, veg, and dip.  \n\nThis shouldn't be more than an hour of work to arrange to get some apps to show up.", "NTA - If your husband wanted to do something nice for his friend then he should have done it. Instead he expected you to do it  without asking....and then tried to force you to do it after you said no by purposely not calling a  caterer for two  whole weeks.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\" and asked me to invite all my single girlfriends and they were to invite their single friends as well.\" .. Agreeing to THIS makes you an AH, too. --  **You were an AH to invite your single friends to let Ethan creep on them. So you supplied the girls to feed Ethan's urges, why not the food and the cocktails, too? Did you at least warn your friends what you had planned them for?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd reconsider the relationship. Why are you with that AH. HE is certainbly treating you and the other girls as objects good for work and sex - but **Paul certainly DOES NOT consider you a partner, and definitely not his equal. He gets angry when you balk at his orders.**", "NTA. No way in hell you should be getting saddled with all the work.", "WTF", "Nta\nYour husband is incredible inconsiderate.", "wow your  husband cares more about his bff than you and doesnt care about the fact your about to have his child.  i would pack up and go somewhere for a week to de stress and think about things", "NTA - If you are inviting the guests, planning and making the cocktails, and planning and making the food - what exactly falls under his job of \"party planning\" that is so time consuming?", "Cancel it without hesitation.  You're not getting the assistance that you should be and quite frankly the premise is just odd.  Your husband wants to have a singles mixer for his friend.... why are you and your dh responsible for fixing this dude's love life?", "NTA, its his friend let him do the work or cancel & hes a big AH for calling you selfish & an asshole, i\u2019d cancel after that.", "He sounds like an ah from another realm. Petty me thinks you should make gross or joke snacks. Like invisible cupcakes or smoked air or just a table with a can opener and lots of cans next to a microwave.", "NTA and I would conveniently be spending the night somewhere else for the party!", "NTA. Cancel it.", "NTA. But this is a perfect example of why a relationship needs good communication in order to thrive. Hubby wants to throw a big party. First question should've been: \"What about the food?\" Hubby would've then said: \"I thought YOU were gonna do the cooking.\" To which you're immediate answer would've been: \"Guess again, Pal.\" The two of you could've decided at that point which hill to die on. Now the party date is coming up and you two haven't even settled this. Cook if you want, order pizza or chinese food if you don't want to cook. But let this be a lesson in Communication Skills 101 for future reference.", "NTA. \n\nSo not only are you not an AH and should definitely not be cooking or doing anything further for this party, but you also need a sit down with your husband to clear some things up before this baby gets here. \n\n1. He shouldn't EVER expect you to be hosting things he wants to do. If he wants to have people over or do a day activity or anything like that, he should actively be planning it and including you on what he might need from you. You are about to have a child together, he can't be like \"we should do a beach day\" and then day of, just be sitting by the car with nothing packed. \n2. He is busy with party planning, but has no menu or cocktails...WTF is he even planning? And the reason I put this is because if he is SOOOO overwhelmed by \"planning\" for a party where he feels no responsibility for the two things people actually care about, he is going to be a tough partner once that baby comes. \n3. The way he spoke to you is inappropriate. You were clear that you didn't want this party because of your energy level, and he proceeded to ignore that, not by having the party, but by expecting you to do all the labor intensive work. When you said no, he called you names. He needs to fully own and apologize for that. \n4. Be clear this isn't happening again. You aren't going to be less tired once the baby gets here, so he needs to get his shit together and act like a partner and an adult. \n\nNo party for sad friend.", "You know he is the AH, he can do the apetizers for HIS friend.", "NTA. You are 7 months pregnant and his *isn't your party*. It's also not your problem that his best friend can't get a girlfriend. If he wants to throw a mixer for his friend, then *he* should throw a mixer. You were generous to even offer to make cocktails. Your husband is TA and needs to start treating you with respect or you should get out before the baby comes and you're stuck with him telling you he's *too busy* for late night feeding and nappy changes", "Eww for the party pimp idea.", "NTA. His friends + his planned event\u2026 he can do the work. He doesn\u2019t get to just order you around.  You\u2019ve told him no, and he\u2019s not listening. He can go to Costco or the local grocery store and pick up frozen appies to serve. \n\nThis also doesn\u2019t bode well though for how the division of labor will be handled after your little one arrives.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
