I currently manage a pool over the summer when I am back home from college and I admit I take my job more seriously than most lifeguards in my area. I have had to save multiple kids over the years and performed some pretty intensive first aid to little kids at my pool, both as a guard and a manager. At the start of this pool season I met and worked with my coworker, who I will call Mike (15m). Upon meeting him I thought he was a little weird but it is hard to not be at that age. I did not know he was special needs at this point. Problems started immediately however because he is a horrible lifeguard. The first day he worked for me I had to tell him several times to scan the water in the guard stand and whistle to enforce simple rules like no running, no diving in the shallow end etc. Throughout his first two 5 hour shifts he was not attentive or responsible in the slightest. The real problems arose on his third shift. Schools in my area closed about a week prior to my posting this, and on the first Friday after school ended he was scheduled at my pool again. I talked to him before we opened about how today would be busy and he needed to be very attentive and watch the water. Sure enough by 2 hours past opening my pool reached maximum capacity (125 people), with about 90 of them being in the water. I came out of the guard office to check the pool chemicals and do some other stuff and I noticed he was staring at his own feet, literally braiding his leg hair. As a test I had a kid who comes to my pool everyday fake drown near him and Mike does not even bat an eye. He spends a total of 5 straight minutes staring at his feet, braiding his leg hairs. When his turn in the chair ended and another guard switched him I exploded. I yelled at him for probably 3-4 minutes about how some kid could have died and that he seemingly could not care less. I told him I was close to reporting him to my supervisor(who does the scheduling) and have him fired. He began crying at which point I left him in the office and went to go finish whatever I was doing before. His behavior for the rest of the day was good and he actually was doing a satisfactory job. One of my other coworkers (17f) told me I went too far and that he has autism. I said I did not care and this is a job, where everyone has the same expectations. About two days later his mom came to the pool and called me an asshole for not being more forgiving since it was only his third shift. I told her the same thing I told my other coworker. So AITA?

It's just a fact that certain people should not be allowed to work certain jobs based on health conditions. For example, if a person is paralyzed, should they be a firefighter? Being a lifeguard is a life or death situation. If a person can not focus, and they cause somebody's death, then it is automatically going to be said that they shouldn't have been allowed to work there. You shouldn't have yelled at him, though. You should have just told your supervisor your concerns and let them handle it. That's what they're there for.", "A slight y t a only because you left him in the chair when he wasn't paying attention. What if something had actually happened while you were \"testing\" him? I would have pulled him immediately. Life Guards are highly under valued - most people don't care what they are doing until they are needed. It doesn't matter that it was only his third shift. Someone could have drowned or slipped while running and cracked their head. You spoke with him on the first two shifts to be more attentive - he wasn't. So you repremanded him.

Lifeguard is an important job like you said and you can't have someone acting like that doing the job. He's young and he has autism which could definitely be why he's struggling to do the job and you can't really blame him for that. He should not have been hired to begin with though. Now, you should have gone to your supervisor or whoever gave him the job directly instead of blowing up at him. Or perhaps try to tell him somewhat nicer that he's going to have a hard time keeping the job if he can't concentrate on his tasks. You still got to keep in mind that he's a special needs kid and yelling at him probably makes him react quite a bit worse than most people. You could have done it differently, but no, that does not make you an ahole because this could be between life and death.", "NTA - lifeguarding is a difficult job and requires constant attentiveness.  someone could easy die if a lifeguard is not watching, and the liability issues here are very high.", "Whoever hired this young man showed callous disregard for the safety of the people in the swimming pool.  I am sure there are some jobs he could do well, but he cannot or will not fulfill the basic duties of a lifeguard on a consistent basis.\n\nThe person you should be yelling at is the boss.  He needs to assign this young man to different duties that he can fulfill competently .\n\nIf you don't report to your supervisor and get him transferred away from being a lifeguard, you're not being a responsible manager.\n\nNo judgement on A ishness, as you shouldn't have yelled at him, but OTOH, after you yelled at him he performed his duties as a lifeguard.", "NTA. They should have told you he was special needs before he even started. This is obviously a job that he is unable to do. You are responsible for the lives of the swimmers as a life guard. This cannot be taken lightly. He sounds like he needs a job where the work doesn't involve making sure people live to see another day.", "NTA. I would rather have a life guard crying about doing a horrible job than seeing children drown because said life guard has autism and is currently busy with staring off into the distance. \n\nFor other jobs? Sure, give them time and patience.\nFor jobs literally making sure nobody drowns? NOPE.", "You're not TA for disciplining him. His disability is not relevant to the fact that he is not doing his job. His mother was literally asking you to endanger childrens lives as an accommodation. You cannot do that. \n\nYTA for how you handled it. he should have been diciplined/fired. not yelled at. No-one should be yelled at in work.", "YTA because that's not at ALL how you handle that. Yes he was in the wrong and yes he needed to be reprimanded but no manager should be literally yelling at an employee, let alone in public", "YTA - Terrible leadership. And honestly, I have a LOT of questions about the safety at your pool. I guarded for 3 years and had one rescue. How the hell are you allowing a situation for multiple rescues and injuries?", "Ya, you're a terrible manager. Everything you did is literally completely wrong.\n\nYta", "I have to say YTA for how you handled it.  Yes, this person seems incompetent and should not be in this position, but even if he wasn\u2019t special needs surely there was a more appropriate way to deal with this.  You should have brought up your concerns with your supervisor or whoever hired him and given specific concerns and examples as to why this person should not be a lifeguard.  There may have been some other position the employee could have been placed in that didn\u2019t put public safety at risk.

He may need some job support/training, but that is for him and his family to work to set up.  Or a lifeguard may just be too much for him.  Either way, you can't allow people to potentially die or be injured due to a lifeguard not being able to properly do their job.", "NTA at all, fire him.

Any disability advocate would tell you that there are jobs that disabled people are simply not capable of performing. A blind person can't be a phlebotomist (the person who draws blood for medical tests). A deaf person probably can't be a security guard. Someone with substance use disorder likely would not do well as a bartender or dispensary employee. And this boy's incompetence as a lifeguard can't be brushed off just because he has a disability. His disability apparently makes him unable to perform the job, so he shouldn't be employed in this position.", "YTA \n\nYou were extremely unprofessional in how you handled it. You don't berate an employee for minutes in public view. You couldn't control your anger.\n\nHe needed to be reprimanded, and you need to discuss this issue with your supervisor. He's already shown a habit of not paying attention.", "YTA. This sounds like a first job. Maybe he's not meant to be a lifeguard, but that's on YOU for hiring him. Yelling at him won't help. You're not a drill sergeant; stop acting like one. If he's doing this bad of a job, calmly pull him aside and tell him what's wrong. Make all the requirements clear and recognize that maybe YOU made a wrong choice in hiring.", "YTA for yelling at him. If this is his third day on the job, of course he\u2019s going to make mistakes. His mom and your other co-worker were right; you could have impressed upon him how serious his inattention was without berating him to the point of tears. You\u2019re an adult \u2013 at this point you should be capable of speaking to a coworker that is performing poorly without flying off the handle. If you can\u2019t figure that out, your professional prospects are going to be very limited. If you think he\u2019s completely incapable of doing the job, you need to escalate this to your supervisor ASAP, not ask some kid to pretend to drown in front of him.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nHe's clearly not up to the job.\n\nScreaming at him for 4 minutes doesn't change that, you didn't fix anything.

Dark triad personality I'm guessing, not fit to be a life guard", "NTA.\n\nThe fuckheads that thought it a good idea to hire a special needs person as a lifeguard in order to fill some stupid \"minority\" check box is straight up dangerous.\n\nYou should never have been put in this position in the first place.\n\nIs there any way you can contact the owners and tell them what you witnessed?\n\nEdit:  Because that's a lawsuit that's just waiting to happen.", "> *report it NOW*\n\nThe young man is extremely unlikely to change.\n\nReport this immediately, OP.

Do I give him another chance? He does seem to understand now. I just do not want anyone getting injured at my pool.", "I apologize I did not realize that was an offensive way to phrase that. Is there a more apt title I could have used for future reference? Should I just refer to him as autistic?

This is literally a life or death job.", "I think you need to pick up the phone right now and immediate tell your supervisor what happened, including the fact that after you yelled at him, he did the job competently.  The problem here is that you can't afford a lapse, even a five minute lapse, or a life could be lost.  The fact that he sat there braiding his leg hair not paying attention tells me that there might be an issue with him fully accepting his role as (literally) standing between life and death.", "You don\u2019t get second chances in situations where your entire function is to save lives.", "Report him. Are you going to be able to watch him on every shift?", "Admittedly the office is not all that far removed from the public view.

He sounds like someone who just doesn't have enough experience.", "I worked as a lifeguard for several years when I was young. The training and testing to get certified are very rigorous, and I am a bit shocked that he was able to pass them, given his attention and focusing issues.\n\nThere are many jobs where making accommodations for neurodivergent employees is very workable. But jobs where lack of attention and focus could result in injury or death are not on that list. \n\nYou are NTA for reporting this to a supervisor; he simply cannot be permitted to continue in this role, because it would be putting lives at risk.", "I will call my supervisor before work tomorrow to talk to him about everything, my actions included. Thanks for the input!", "You YELLED at him for 4 minutes. Yelling at someone isn't having a discussion and is much louder. \n\nDid you bring up your concerns about this employee to the supervisor prior to this episode? Have they been made aware that he's been caught multiple times for not paying attention?", "At the end of the second shift he worked I actually did get into the stand and showed him what my expectations were for proper scanning and posture. He seemed to understand. Also before the third shift I was very clear with him on how to behave. My frustration was more-so with his apparent disregard for my instructions and the people in the water. I agree with you and everyone else commenting that I should not have yelled at him in the way I did.", "With most jobs I\u2019d agree with you, but this one can risk people\u2019s safety.", "I'm so glad you're doing this.  Please don't let anyone talk you out of it.  In this culture, there's a lot of emphasis on not squealing on people, not being a tattle-tale, not being a snitch, blahbittybah.  That's not what you're doing.  You're talking with a more experienced person about what steps to take in order for your pool to be a safe place to swim and play.  You're sharing vital information about a situation he should be aware of.  Not doing so could risk people's lives.  You have an extremely responsible job. I think that sharing your actions fully shows a lot of integrity in that job.  This is a mature plan.  Bravo!", "I actually did ask my supervisor after his second shift not to schedule him for his third on a day we would be busy because of these issues, so I could show him again on a calmer day. I am guessing he had no other option for the day and had to schedule him. I agree with you and everyone else commenting that I should not have yelled at him in the way I did", "Did he quit?", "No, in fact he has worked one shift since the incident where I had no complaints or issues with his behavior and the work he did."]}
