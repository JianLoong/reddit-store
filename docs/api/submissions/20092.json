I currently manage a pool over the summer when I am back home from college and I admit I take my job more seriously than most lifeguards in my area. I have had to save multiple kids over the years and performed some pretty intensive first aid to little kids at my pool, both as a guard and a manager. At the start of this pool season I met and worked with my coworker, who I will call Mike (15m). Upon meeting him I thought he was a little weird but it is hard to not be at that age. I did not know he was special needs at this point. Problems started immediately however because he is a horrible lifeguard. The first day he worked for me I had to tell him several times to scan the water in the guard stand and whistle to enforce simple rules like no running, no diving in the shallow end etc. Throughout his first two 5 hour shifts he was not attentive or responsible in the slightest. The real problems arose on his third shift. Schools in my area closed about a week prior to my posting this, and on the first Friday after school ended he was scheduled at my pool again. I talked to him before we opened about how today would be busy and he needed to be very attentive and watch the water. Sure enough by 2 hours past opening my pool reached maximum capacity (125 people), with about 90 of them being in the water. I came out of the guard office to check the pool chemicals and do some other stuff and I noticed he was staring at his own feet, literally braiding his leg hair. As a test I had a kid who comes to my pool everyday fake drown near him and Mike does not even bat an eye. He spends a total of 5 straight minutes staring at his feet, braiding his leg hairs. When his turn in the chair ended and another guard switched him I exploded. I yelled at him for probably 3-4 minutes about how some kid could have died and that he seemingly could not care less. I told him I was close to reporting him to my supervisor(who does the scheduling) and have him fired. He began crying at which point I left him in the office and went to go finish whatever I was doing before. His behavior for the rest of the day was good and he actually was doing a satisfactory job. One of my other coworkers (17f) told me I went too far and that he has autism. I said I did not care and this is a job, where everyone has the same expectations. About two days later his mom came to the pool and called me an asshole for not being more forgiving since it was only his third shift. I told her the same thing I told my other coworker. So AITA? What could/should I have done different?\n\nEDIT: Some people seem to think that having a kid fake drown as a test is not professional, however in my company it is a practice called vatting which we use to test our guards when they are on the clock. I vat each guard at my pool once every 10 days(3 or 4 shifts) and my assistant manager vats me at the same rate.", "created_utc": 1687209388, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dqyld/aita_for_making_my_special_needs_coworker_cry/", "score": 1066, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now, you should have gone to your supervisor or whoever gave him the job directly instead of blowing up at him. Or perhaps try to tell him somewhat nicer that he's going to have a hard time keeping the job if he can't concentrate on his tasks.

Not enough time for training, not enough guards to meet state standards, insufficient gear, etc. A special needs lifeguard isn't inherently bad, but if they can't meet the job requirements, they're out.

If you can't focus you shouldn't be there.", "I'm so sick of random allistic people like OP's coworker insinuating that it's somehow ableist, taboo, or morally reprehensible to treat functional autistic people like actual autonomous *people* instead of fragile toddlers.

And I say this as a neurodivergent (diagnosed ADHD as a teen but almost certainly just autistic) person myself. \n\nMike isn't a toddler, either mentally or physically. He is clearly independent and capable enough to be hired for a demanding job without a caretaker's supervision. That means he is also independent and capable enough to take responsibility for his own actions, including his mistakes. He isn't immune to fucking up or being an AH just because he's autistic. He also doesn't need to be treated with kiddie gloves just because he's autistic, and doing so without any actual guidance from a caretaker (i.e., them making a specific note of his need for accommodations like \"not being sternly scolded or yelled at\") is openly infantilizing and as such significantly *more* ableist than treating him like a normal human person. Autistic people, much like allistic people, cannot learn or improve themselves when people are too busy tip-toeing nervously around them like they're infant aliens as opposed to actually teaching them and treating them like a human being. Mike was actively endangering the lives of the people and children he was meant to be supervising by not paying attention to the pool. That's absolutely unacceptable in a lifeguard regardless of whether or not he is autistic. \n\nObviously I do not speak for all neurodivergent/autistic people, and some autistic people and scenarios involving autistic people *do* call for a gentler/more empathetic approach... but that kind of unprompted nonsense from OP's coworker really just grinds my gears.

And his mom was in the wrong as well. This isn't a customer service job where the worst thing that happens is that a customer storms out and leaves a bad review. Mike failing to do his job as a lifeguard attentively and proactively means that people and children might *die*. Doesn't matter if it's his first shift or his nintieth: the actual, real-world consequences here for inattentiveness aren't any more or less forgiving. Getting yelled at by one's superior is stressful as all hell, especially when you're young and new to the job, but it's still a hell of a lot less stressful than having to live with the fact that someone died on *your* watch, not even because you tried and failed to save them, but because you weren't paying attention and didn't even notice that they needed saving in the first place.", "There could be lives at stake, there shouldn't be mistakes if he made it this far.

His mom could go tell the police officers they were 'assholes' too and see how well that flew. \n\nCould you have been nicer? Yeah, maybe.

What if the worst had happened?

I don't want him to be sad but even more I don't want hurt or drowned kids.  It should not be taboo to tell someone they aren't suited for the job.  If you catch him drifting again, report him.

And frankly, a job as a lifeguard isn't something that someone with a disability that affects attention span and quick action can handle. I agree that yelling wasn't the best, probably better to have gone directly to a supervisor, but I understand your anger. I've personally used an AED on someone at the pool where I worked. The lifeguard who pulled her out was 17 and it was maybe his 3rd shift. But even on a packed August day, he saw her. Did he freeze up and need help with the AED? Yes, but he got her out of the damn pool in the first place, that's what matters.", "Honestly, I vote ESH, except maybe the 15 year old lifeguard in question. \n\nScreaming at him for several minutes on end seems a bit much to me. Is that the disciplinary procedure for that company? Or was that your choice to scream at a teenager?\n\nI agree that he wasn't doing his job properly. No arguments from me on that point. But, he's 15. He's still basically a child. Had he ever been a lifeguard before? Had anyone trained him? \n\nPersonally I think the fault lies more with those who employed him without seeing if he could adequately do the job.

Children can die.", "Not at all.", "YTA, yelling at employees is unprofessional and demotivating. You made a child with autism cry.
