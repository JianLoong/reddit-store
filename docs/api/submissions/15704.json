For that reason, no matter how epic it would be, I would personally never do that. \n\nThat having been said, it\u2019s your day, not theirs (or mine). You just have to decide what you want more - the company or the destination. There\u2019s nothing wrong with whatever you decide, but you will have to accept their not being able to attend if you choose the latter.\n\nI\u2019d suggest setting up a livestream for family that really want to be there, but can\u2019t afford it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou get to have your wedding wherever and whenever you want.

Wouldn't you lose your deposit ?", "INFO:  How much would the wedding have cost in the U.S., and what price range for the Jamaica wedding did you communicate to guests when you were planning to change?\n\nWhen you say the family members agreed, do you mean that HIS family members agreed to the cost (accurate within $100-200) that you projected?", "I\u2019m going with NAH. You can have the wedding where you want, but you need to understand that that means some people can\u2019t or won\u2019t make it. You may have to make a choice between having family there and having the location you want. You can perhaps have a small party or reception for them to celebrate at home? \n\nI personally would skip on a Jamaican wedding if anyone in my family was having one unless they paid for pretty much everything. I definitely wouldn\u2019t spend 2.5k+ on it. But, I also wouldn\u2019t judge family for choosing to have one there. It\u2019s their event and they can make it memorable how they choose. \n\nI think a lot of this comes down to whether one sees a wedding as more for the couple or more for those celebrating the couple, and that\u2019s not only culture dependent but often varies by individual.", "INFO: you say you cannot afford the wedding in the US but you expect your guests to travel and stay in a 5 star resort.

Is this your dream or a shared dream? Because having your family and friends there to support your wedding is a big deal for lots of people. Sounds like your family can afford it and you aren\u2019t fussed that the in-laws can\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t call that a great start to married life personally", "This is really a tricky one for me to answer but I\u2019m going to have to go with YTA. It\u2019s hard to not see that what you\u2019ve done is selfish, and I get the feeling deep down you knew this would be the result.\n\nI mean you\u2019re marrying someone i would presume you love and respect and I believe part of that is honouring the people who brought your husband into this world and raised him to be the man you fell In love with. \n\nYou\u2019re entering a marriage by royally ticking off and upsetting you\u2019re future in-laws from the get go. I hope they don\u2019t hold this against you for years to come else it\u2019ll make for an uncomfortable life for you and your husband. \n\nI don\u2019t see weddings the same but I also recognise that\u2019s not on you or your problem. Weddings to me are not just about the bride and groom, they\u2019re about making genuine promises to your partner in front of all the family and friends that love him/her. It\u2019s a heartfelt day for the parents to watch their children reach a milestone in their lives and I feel like it\u2019s about giving thanks to them to. Again that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re well within your rights to feel different and that it\u2019s your day not anyone else\u2019s.\n\nMaybe it would of been better to get married in the US on an affordable budget and honeymoon in Jamaica.\n\nCould you not have sacrificed a bit of the insanely high budget for your wedding so that you could have an affordable but still wonderful wedding in the US? I know the wedding like you said is cheaper in Jamaica but flights to the Carribean  are anything but and then a 5 star hotel on top of that, my father is British Jamaican and whenever we\u2019ve gone back there  or just him and my mother they like to stay at 5 star resorts and I have rarely been able to afford to go with them if they invite us because it\u2019s really expensive. \n\nDespite everything I do hope you and your future husband have a wonderful day and vacation. Jamaica is beautiful and the people are the most laid back you\u2019ll ever meet.", "NTA, but neither are they for reacting to the price. It like serious conversations about everyone\u2019s budgets should have happened before booking a five star resort. Common courtesy is to reach out to immediate family before booking a resort and flights to ensure everyone you want to be there can afford to be there.", "Let\u2019s be honest. You can easily have a wedding in the US far cheaper than at a 5-star resort in Jamaica. You want a wedding at a 5-star resort in Jamaica whether or not your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family can afford it or not. Now you tell me, is having a wedding at a 5-star resort in Jamaica worth your fianc\u00e9 not having his family there? \n\nIt\u2019s the wedding for you, not the marriage or family.", "NTA.

Your wedding do what you want if they can\u2019t make it that\u2019s fine", "I dont want to make a judgement but weddings are all about sharing an experience of a lifetime with your loved ones...and not about the location you are at but the people who are there with you to share this experience with you", "NAH. It\u2019s your wedding so you can do what you want but it\u2019s completely fair for them not to want to spend a lot of time and money on attending.

Sure. So, as one does when planning a vacation with people, you checked with everyone ahead of time to make sure that the way they wanted to spend their vacation budget (time and money) for this year was going to a 5 star resort in Jamaica on the dates you picked? You\u2019re absolutely positive no one had anything they\u2019d rather do with their time and money? This wasn\u2019t in any way because your friends did it or some influencer influenced you or because the two of you love Jamaica and assumed that your wedding should be the most important event in everyone\u2019s life this year?\n\nI did read your whole post, but i didn\u2019t actually have to read past the headline because I promise you that the correct answer to anyone who posts about their destination wedding is that they\u2019re the AH, unless they\u2019re paying to fly everyone in first class and paying for the hotel and food.\n\nIt\u2019s really amazing to me how many wedding couples prioritize the speshul, speshul location over making it as reasonable as possible for the family and friends they care about to be at the wedding. It says something about their values.", "YTA. You obviously had your own budgetary concerns, but didn\u2019t care about anyone else\u2019s.  And it was plain tone deaf to book a destination wedding in Jamaica (unless you live in Haiti or the Caymans) and at a 5-star resort, on top of that.  \n\nAin\u2019t nobody got money for that!!", "I will say NTA for having the wedding where you want to have it. My only thought is how will your fiance feel if his family is unable to attend? I know we have been told about destination weddings and we try to be supportive, but in the back of your mind you are trying to figure out how to afford it. I wonder if that is what happened with his family.", "NTA have your wedding wherever you want to but just don\u2019t hold it against those who are invited because it might be too expensive for them to attend", "YTA. Destinations weddings are for the rich. If you aren't paying for everyone's travel, your the AH.", "I'm definitely going to be downvoted for that, but YTA. You want to have a nice vacation, and that's all right... but expecting someone to pay 2500-5000 dollars per couple (that's the number OP gave in the comments) is insane. You cannot possibly NOT UNDERSTAND how his family is upset about that, in the majority of cases the closest family wants to be able  to attend the wedding.\n\nEdit: typo.", "NTA, but this is something that you both should\u2019ve known was going to happen. Your destination wedding is obviously expensive for your guests so not everyone will be able to go, is kind of absurd at this point of your planning to suddenly realize that not all can go.", "I wouldn't say YTA exactly.  I mean, if it is your dream, then it's your dream.  But you would be TA if you didn't understand that some people won't be able to make it to your wedding.  Maybe some important family.  If you cannot understand that, then you would be TA.  I know if someone invited me to a destination wedding, even immediate family, I would not be able to attend due to price.", "NTA because it's your wedding and you can do it how you choose. \n\nThat said, I have a great deal of difficulty with your position. You can do a service more cheaply at your destination than your traditional wedding, but it's likely not cheaper in total when you add airfare and hotels for all of your guests. It feels like there's a compromise somewhere that you've been ignoring, like perhaps a non-traditional wedding closer to home. \n\nIn the end, I expect you'll be having fewer guests and grudges will be held regardless of understanding.", "YTA - but not at all why you think I might be saying that.  As annoying as destination weddings are, what the hell are \"save the date\" mailings?  \n\nI know what they are, but I'm a curmudgeon and don't understand.  Is it an invitation or not?  It's such a darned scam!  Just send the damned invitation!  If the date is set, why are you spending money on that nonsense?  \n\n\"Buckle up!  You're getting an invitation!\"  Holy mackerel,  it's a scam.", "Idk who is TA here but I will say this, for the relatives other than you and your SO parents it will just be a fun week or maybe a memorable event for maybe a year or two nothing more than that, but it's one of the biggest milestones of your life and you don't want to remember as a time when you had to adjust for relatives, don't adjust things for anyone other than your SO or parents because you and they are the only people who will truly cherish your wedding. I would advise talking it thoroughly with your SO (although chances are you have already done it or are planning to do it).", "Nta, but did it have to be 5 star? Average people have a tough time paying for a trip to a 5-star resort. I know you said there is a cheaper resort close by, but the whole reason to go to a wedding is to celebrate it with the happy couple. If they are at a different resort, that's kind of hard to do.", "NTA\n\nBut wow attitude from your fiancee.  First agreeing to the destination wedding and then saying you should have considered a cheaper destination after being harassed by family.\n\nThis is the issue with a destination wedding - you only get the people in attendance who can afford it.  If \"must have\" family can't afford it, you might have to adjust your budget or you have to adjust your plans.  It might suck, but that's what you get.", "ESH? Their child/relative\u2019s wedding should be plenty \u201cworth it\u201d if they can afford it.  There\u2019s also the option of staying at a different, non-5-star resort and traveling between. If they can\u2019t, and OP and fianc\u00e9 can afford to fly the most \u201cimportant\u201d family members there, then great.  Regardless, you can\u2019t get upset when folks don\u2019t come to a destination wedding- their idea of \u201cexpensive\u201d and yours may differ.

You may have been insistent about this decision so he may have kept his mouth shut, but expensive decisions should be agreed upon openly. \n\nIn general, couples who have a destination wedding bust still expect everyone to put out $1000s and show up will always make YTA, IMO.\n\nBut in this case they're sounding pretty dismissive of any option other than a domestic wedding, but that's a non-starter since bills have been paid. NTA for this particular angle.\n\nSo NTA with his family's denials now, but YTA for an expensive destination and ESH for husband's poor communication before decisions were made.", "NTA. It's your day, do what you want with it.\n\nAs someone planning a destination wedding knowing full well most of our friends and some of our family won't be able to attend I don't feel bad about it.  It's the place we want to get married, it's our choice and our wedding. We are giving everyone plenty of noice (2+ years) to save and plan accordingly. If they can't make it, or choose not to, then they can stay home and watch the live stream instead. Our theory is that if they really want to be there in person they will find a way to make it happen.", "Maybe have a small ceremony for groom\u2019s family before you go. I\u2019m thinking something small and intimate such as at the groom\u2019s house or at his parents. My brother got married in my parent\u2019s backyard. it was really nice and affordable.", "NTA. You've offered them solutions. Sounds like they either want you to get married at \"home\", or they want you to fully fund a holiday for them. That's not fair to you.\n\nThis is the risk of a destination wedding, sometimes people can't come. It's an AH move on their part to wait until *after* you've booked everything to try and make you change your minds.\n\nYou really need to talk to your fianc\u00e9 and get on the same page. It's his wedding, too, and I'm sure he wants his family there. You need to have a frank and honest discussion about who will/won't attend, the fact that you booked an overseas wedding because it was too expensive at home, and the fact that you will be out *more* money if you have to cancel what you've booked. Maybe you can get married in Jamaica and have a smaller party when you get home. Maybe the Jamacian wedding doesn't work anymore. Maybe the family is just a bunch of whingers that need to get over it. But you need to get on top of this *together*.", "NTA, but understand many won't attend.  When you return, have a nice home reception for everyone, just so that no one feels left out of the celebration.  I would ask for 'no presents' at the at-home reception.", "NTA. You've explained that you are spending your money.  This is your wedding.  You appear to cool with the possibility that no family will be there and aren't demanding they join you without regard to their financial constraints.     \nIt sounds like the ones who are asking you to change your plans need to find a way to save face about the financial hardship that attending your wedding would place upon them.     \nAn option would be to host a reception upon your return or an anniversary party next year. Neither quite hit the mark in keeping with cultural traditions...just a thought.", "NTA it\u2019s your day do it your way!", "NTA, My hubby and I did this exact thing. Wedding planning was getting nowhere with family so we went fancy in Jamaica. We did Iberostar and it was freaking amazing!! Do a trash the dress shoot. I have some amazing shots at the beach and in the water. Have a blast \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, OP. If this was an issue, they needed to speak up before everything was planned. They are invited. You offered support. At this point, they can choose to RSVP yes or no.", "Lol!! That's so funny because that's the exact reason I would have a destination wedding haha! That or an elopement. Buuut...my family wouldn't expect anything less from the daughter who hates being the center of attention. Although my mom gave me a stern look and said, \"give me at least 2 months notice.\"", "Resort weddings are super cheap for the couple because they are passing the costs into the guests. Usually guests at resort weddings either have to stay at the resort or buy a day pass, which covers their food and drink. So the couple isn't really \"hosting\" then the same way they would at a normal venue.", "It's not", "But also know that this will cause upset. They want to be there for the wedding to support family and enjoy the moment but they either can\u2019t or they can but with difficulty. Destination weddings ask a lot of guests and it feels like a lose lose. \n\nAlso it is not a holiday for everyone, it is a wedding. If they want a Jamaican holiday they would book what they want, when they want it. \n\nTotally your wedding, your choices etc but be prepared to accept their upset.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "My husband and I got married in a picturesque town about 5h drive from where we and all our family and friends live.\n\nClose enough that anyone who mattered could make it work, far enough away that the ppl who we were obliged to invite could make excuses."]}
