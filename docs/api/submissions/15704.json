For that reason, no matter how epic it would be, I would personally never do that. \n\nThat having been said, it\u2019s your day, not theirs (or mine). You just have to decide what you want more - the company or the destination. There\u2019s nothing wrong with whatever you decide, but you will have to accept their not being able to attend if you choose the latter.\n\nI\u2019d suggest setting up a livestream for family that really want to be there, but can\u2019t afford it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou get to have your wedding wherever and whenever you want.

Wouldn't you lose your deposit ?", "INFO:  How much would the wedding have cost in the U.S., and what price range for the Jamaica wedding did you communicate to guests when you were planning to change?\n\nWhen you say the family members agreed, do you mean that HIS family members agreed to the cost (accurate within $100-200) that you projected?", "I\u2019m going with NAH. You can have the wedding where you want, but you need to understand that that means some people can\u2019t or won\u2019t make it. You may have to make a choice between having family there and having the location you want. You can perhaps have a small party or reception for them to celebrate at home? \n\nI personally would skip on a Jamaican wedding if anyone in my family was having one unless they paid for pretty much everything. I definitely wouldn\u2019t spend 2.5k+ on it. But, I also wouldn\u2019t judge family for choosing to have one there. It\u2019s their event and they can make it memorable how they choose. \n\nI think a lot of this comes down to whether one sees a wedding as more for the couple or more for those celebrating the couple, and that\u2019s not only culture dependent but often varies by individual.", "INFO: you say you cannot afford the wedding in the US but you expect your guests to travel and stay in a 5 star resort.

Is this your dream or a shared dream? Because having your family and friends there to support your wedding is a big deal for lots of people. Sounds like your family can afford it and you aren\u2019t fussed that the in-laws can\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t call that a great start to married life personally", "This is really a tricky one for me to answer but I\u2019m going to have to go with YTA. It\u2019s hard to not see that what you\u2019ve done is selfish, and I get the feeling deep down you knew this would be the result.\n\nI mean you\u2019re marrying someone i would presume you love and respect and I believe part of that is honouring the people who brought your husband into this world and raised him to be the man you fell In love with. \n\nYou\u2019re entering a marriage by royally ticking off and upsetting you\u2019re future in-laws from the get go. I hope they don\u2019t hold this against you for years to come else it\u2019ll make for an uncomfortable life for you and your husband. \n\nI don\u2019t see weddings the same but I also recognise that\u2019s not on you or your problem. Weddings to me are not just about the bride and groom, they\u2019re about making genuine promises to your partner in front of all the family and friends that love him/her. It\u2019s a heartfelt day for the parents to watch their children reach a milestone in their lives and I feel like it\u2019s about giving thanks to them to. Again that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re well within your rights to feel different and that it\u2019s your day not anyone else\u2019s.\n\nMaybe it would of been better to get married in the US on an affordable budget and honeymoon in Jamaica.\n\nCould you not have sacrificed a bit of the insanely high budget for your wedding so that you could have an affordable but still wonderful wedding in the US? I know the wedding like you said is cheaper in Jamaica but flights to the Carribean  are anything but and then a 5 star hotel on top of that, my father is British Jamaican and whenever we\u2019ve gone back there  or just him and my mother they like to stay at 5 star resorts and I have rarely been able to afford to go with them if they invite us because it\u2019s really expensive. \n\nDespite everything I do hope you and your future husband have a wonderful day and vacation. Jamaica is beautiful and the people are the most laid back you\u2019ll ever meet.", "NTA, but neither are they for reacting to the price. It like serious conversations about everyone\u2019s budgets should have happened before booking a five star resort. Common courtesy is to reach out to immediate family before booking a resort and flights to ensure everyone you want to be there can afford to be there.", "Let\u2019s be honest. You can easily have a wedding in the US far cheaper than at a 5-star resort in Jamaica. You want a wedding at a 5-star resort in Jamaica whether or not your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family can afford it or not.

Your wedding do what you want if they can\u2019t make it that\u2019s fine", "I dont want to make a judgement but weddings are all about sharing an experience of a lifetime with your loved ones...and not about the location you are at but the people who are there with you to share this experience with you", "NAH. It\u2019s your wedding so you can do what you want but it\u2019s completely fair for them not to want to spend a lot of time and money on attending.

Sure. So, as one does when planning a vacation with people, you checked with everyone ahead of time to make sure that the way they wanted to spend their vacation budget (time and money) for this year was going to a 5 star resort in Jamaica on the dates you picked? You\u2019re absolutely positive no one had anything they\u2019d rather do with their time and money? This wasn\u2019t in any way because your friends did it or some influencer influenced you or because the two of you love Jamaica and assumed that your wedding should be the most important event in everyone\u2019s life this year?\n\nI did read your whole post, but i didn\u2019t actually have to read past the headline because I promise you that the correct answer to anyone who posts about their destination wedding is that they\u2019re the AH, unless they\u2019re paying to fly everyone in first class and paying for the hotel and food.\n\nIt\u2019s really amazing to me how many wedding couples prioritize the speshul, speshul location over making it as reasonable as possible for the family and friends they care about to be at the wedding. It says something about their values.", "YTA. You obviously had your own budgetary concerns, but didn\u2019t care about anyone else\u2019s.  And it was plain tone deaf to book a destination wedding in Jamaica (unless you live in Haiti or the Caymans) and at a 5-star resort, on top of that.  \n\nAin\u2019t nobody got money for that!!", "I will say NTA for having the wedding where you want to have it. My only thought is how will your fiance feel if his family is unable to attend? I know we have been told about destination weddings and we try to be supportive, but in the back of your mind you are trying to figure out how to afford it. I wonder if that is what happened with his family.", "NTA have your wedding wherever you want to but just don\u2019t hold it against those who are invited because it might be too expensive for them to attend", "YTA. Destinations weddings are for the rich. If you aren't paying for everyone's travel, your the AH.", "I'm definitely going to be downvoted for that, but YTA. You want to have a nice vacation, and that's all right... but expecting someone to pay 2500-5000 dollars per couple (that's the number OP gave in the comments) is insane. You cannot possibly NOT UNDERSTAND how his family is upset about that, in the majority of cases the closest family wants to be able  to attend the wedding.\n\nEdit: typo.", "NTA, but this is something that you both should\u2019ve known was going to happen. Your destination wedding is obviously expensive for your guests so not everyone will be able to go, is kind of absurd at this point of your planning to suddenly realize that not all can go.", "I wouldn't say YTA exactly.  I mean, if it is your dream, then it's your dream.  But you would be TA if you didn't understand that some people won't be able to make it to your wedding.  Maybe some important family.  If you cannot understand that, then you would be TA.  I know if someone invited me to a destination wedding, even immediate family, I would not be able to attend due to price.", "NTA because it's your wedding and you can do it how you choose. \n\nThat said, I have a great deal of difficulty with your position. You can do a service more cheaply at your destination than your traditional wedding, but it's likely not cheaper in total when you add airfare and hotels for all of your guests. It feels like there's a compromise somewhere that you've been ignoring, like perhaps a non-traditional wedding closer to home. \n\nIn the end, I expect you'll be having fewer guests and grudges will be held regardless of understanding.", "YTA - but not at all why you think I might be saying that.  As annoying as destination weddings are, what the hell are \"save the date\" mailings?  \n\nI know what they are, but I'm a curmudgeon and don't understand.  Is it an invitation or not?  It's such a darned scam!  Just send the damned invitation!  If the date is set, why are you spending money on that nonsense?  \n\n\"Buckle up!  You're getting an invitation!\"  Holy mackerel,  it's a scam.", "Idk who is TA here but I will say this, for the relatives other than you and your SO parents it will just be a fun week or maybe a memorable event for maybe a year or two nothing more than that, but it's one of the biggest milestones of your life and you don't want to remember as a time when you had to adjust for relatives, don't adjust things for anyone other than your SO or parents because you and they are the only people who will truly cherish your wedding. I would advise talking it thoroughly with your SO (although chances are you have already done it or are planning to do it).", "Nta, but did it have to be 5 star? Average people have a tough time paying for a trip to a 5-star resort. I know you said there is a cheaper resort close by, but the whole reason to go to a wedding is to celebrate it with the happy couple. If they are at a different resort, that's kind of hard to do.", "NTA\n\nBut wow attitude from your fiancee.  First agreeing to the destination wedding and then saying you should have considered a cheaper destination after being harassed by family.\n\nThis is the issue with a destination wedding - you only get the people in attendance who can afford it.  If \"must have\" family can't afford it, you might have to adjust your budget or you have to adjust your plans.  It might suck, but that's what you get.", "ESH? Their child/relative\u2019s wedding should be plenty \u201cworth it\u201d if they can afford it.  There\u2019s also the option of staying at a different, non-5-star resort and traveling between. If they can\u2019t, and OP and fianc\u00e9 can afford to fly the most \u201cimportant\u201d family members there, then great.  Regardless, you can\u2019t get upset when folks don\u2019t come to a destination wedding- their idea of \u201cexpensive\u201d and yours may differ.

I can think of much better vacations I can have for $2500.", "The main thing I learned from the one destination wedding I attended was that I really don't care for tropical vacations where you sit in the beach all day.", "Does your fianc\u00e9 understand? If his whole side has problems coming he might not be happy.", "You're not wrong, but I would suggest that people who don't give a crap about whether anyone else enjoys it, are shitty people that I wouldn't want to be friends with in the first place.", "Don't worry it is only the in laws that have a problem with it.\n\nTherefore they must be the assholes.\n\n/s", "Could not agree more.  For 95% of her friends and family, she's not doing them any favors.  I don't have anything against Jamaica, but if I'm going to shell out thousands on a vacation with travel/food/hotel, I can think of 50 places I'd go first.", "Yeah this is what I realized after attending a destination wedding myself. It\u2019s not a vacation because you have to plan everything you do around wedding activities. It saved the couple several thousand to do it there instead of at home, but it cost everyone else several thousand to attend. I don\u2019t want to do that to people.", "This sounds so perfect. No drama and everyone had a lovely time.", "It was really lovely and so well planned out.  Both bride and groom are such thoughtful kind  people!", " A wedding is about the union of 2 friend groups and families, it is actually not  about sucking off the bride and groom. What an odd, self absorbed world view you have.", "It really isn't. You are so fucking entitled it's insane. Not surprising for Reddit though.", "No one is the AH for having a destination wedding. \n\nNo one is obliged to attend a destination wedding. \n\nNTA", "Don\u2019t change for them, it\u2019s your wedding. If they have a issue with cost they can politely decline attending and send a gift. Destination weddings keep the punters away. Anyone who\u2019s just looking for a free meal and open bar is filtered out.", "YTA\n\nDestination weddings suck.\n\nWhat makes you an AH?\n\n>...it would be too expensive to have a traditional style wedding in the states, so we decided to have a wedding at a resort in Jamaica.\n\nI am calling BS, a traditional wedding in the states doesn't have to be expensive. It not going to be expensive for you because your guest are offsetting the cost. 5 Star Resort in Jamaica cheaper than a traditional style wedding? You sound delusional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>... we wanted it to be a fun vacation for all...\n\nThis also makes you an AH. This isn't a vacation, if it was EVERYONE's input would matter and EVERYONE's would get a say in the vacation spot. Since you and your fianc\u00e9e are making the sole decisions it is not a vacation. It is a WEDDING not a vacation.\n\nWeddings are supposed to be gathering of family and friends to celebrate two people coming together to create a new family. Reality is weddings aren't 100%  about YOU but this is the modern day world me me me attitude.\n\nAlso, I don't want to give up my vacation time to go to a \"vacation\" spot that I didn't choose.", "Soft YTA, because it is your wedding, but\u2026\n\n\u201cHaving a wedding here is expensive for us, so instead, we\u2019re going to make it expensive for everyone else.\u201d\n\nAnd I get that it\u2019s your wedding and you\u2019re cool if people don\u2019t come, but understand that your friends and family feel pressured to come even when they can\u2019t afford it. And no one wants to admit they cannot afford something.\n\nI\u2019ve been to destination weddings and they were fun, but as much as the people around you love you, in private, there will be frustrations due to the expense. Even if affording it isn\u2019t an issue. \n\nEspecially if you expect gifts and a shower and a bachelor/bachelorette party. Even as a guest, the costs of a normal wedding add up. \n\nGiven that the driving factor for the destination wedding was the financial burden on you, you don\u2019t seem to be concerned with putting that financial burden on the people closest to you.", "As long as you don\u2019t expect anyone to come. People don\u2019t want to plan their expensive vacations around your wedding. NAH.", "2,5K-5K just for the resort (so you can get discounts for the actual wedding), but if you add travel costs and other costs...  YTA. Everybody will resent you for this, especially your inlaws. And they are right!", "Destination weddings can be a minefield. I don't know many people who could afford to fork out the kind of money required for someone else's event, I know I couldn't. If you were insisting that everyone you invited sucks up the expense, and having a tantrum if they couldn't do it, you'd definitely be an asshole but that doesn't seem to be the case. You seem to be understanding and accepting of the fact people may not be able to do it, and more than willing to help out with options. So then we come to people who apparently can't afford it and don't want your options, but instead of saying they can't come, are throwing their own tantrum and saying you need to change the venue so that they can attend. Fuck that, your wedding, your destination - if you're ok with people not being able to make it and it's what you want, do it. NTA.", "NTA, but please realize that a \u201cfun vacation for *everyone* to enjoy\u201d and \u201cfive star resort\u201d are not always compatible.", "YTA\n\nNot everyone wants to spend their vacation and money 1) in Jamaica 2) at an all-inclusive\n\nIt's inconsiderate that you didn't really consider WHO would be impacted - sounds like it's his side. \n\nNot a good look to start off not really caring if your partner's family can even be there.", "op=NTA\n\njust call it an elopement and honeymoon and if people don't want to attend your elopement.  Fine.\n\nETA Consider a \"reception\" party in home area--maybe a fun potluck type dinner or picnic.", "> It would be too expensive to have a traditional style wedding in the states, so we decided to have a wedding at a resort in Jamaica\n\n> The reason we are doing a destination wedding, we wanted it to be a fun vacation for all\n\nThese two statements seem to contradict each other, but whatever. It\u2019s your wedding, do what you want, but don\u2019t be surprised when people are hurt that you don\u2019t care they\u2019ve been excluded from your celebration because you went out of your way to make it extremely expensive for people to come.\n\nYou also need to reeeeally make sure your fiance is 100% on board and agrees that a fancy destination wedding is more important to him than his family being there. \n\nNAH as long as groom is still happy with the plans.", "NTA if they don\u2019t want to travel then they don\u2019t have to be in the wedding.", "YTA: unless you explicitly know that you can come and go between two completely different resorts freely, do not recommend that. At almost every all-inclusive I\u2019ve see you are strictly forbidden from going from the lower tier hotel into the higher tier. There\u2019s a reason why you wear wristbands", "NTA understand they probably declined because they don't want to go to Jamaica. If you booked it because it is the wedding you want and don't care who comes it is fine. If you booked it counting on everyone coming you should reconsider. You can't force people to spend more ney and their vacation going to a foreign country you picked on a date you picked.", "I wouldn't even watch your live stream.", "Having a destination wedding is saying to prospective guests \"My desire to have you at my wedding correlates directly with your disposable income.\" \n\nI mean, you're entitled but because of that \"I completely understand\" won't be the salve you think it will.\n\nBut one thing I gotta ask: how did the two of you get to a point of *booking* without checking if this will be affordable for your SO's family? That's super inconsiderate.", ">we wanted it to be a fun vacation for all \n\nThat was right in the end of the post. Maybe added after you commented but they clearly wanted it to be a vacation and a wedding.", "Guess I'll take you off the invite list then.", "Yep. LOL", "We did the same sort of thing (not Greece, but a destination) for a number of reasons. Then wore our wedding outfits again for a luncheon a few months later (and her parents hired a photographer so people could get pics with us in the dress and suit) and told everyone in advance that there would be that reception. Our immediate family and a few friends came to the destination, rest of family and others came to the US reception. No need to make anyone feel bad for not coming, whether not able to or just preferring to use their vacation time and money for a vacation of their own choosing!"]}
