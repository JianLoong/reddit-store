They\u2019ve also been together since college like me and my fianc\u00e9. So we\u2019ve been inseparable since going on double dates and trips together and have had an amazing time post college.\n\n My fianc\u00e9 proposed to me last year and it\u2019s all been very exciting wedding planning has been stressful and exciting and Holly is my bridesmaid and John is my fianc\u00e9\u2019s best man. Our wedding is February next year and in the midst of planning last night John came over to our house and said that he wanted to propose to Holly! Me and my fianc\u00e9 were over for the moon for him and I was excited for another wedding! So I asked him when he planned to propose and that we\u2019d be down to help with the proposal and everything. He smiled and then said that he was thankful and said that he\u2019d love to propose to Holly at our wedding. Before I said anything he showed me a video of a bride giving her bridesmaid her bouquet instead of tossing it and then the man proposing he then said I\u2019d love to do something like this. I was sort of speechless as was my fianc\u00e9. \n\nSo he then asked us would that be okay. I took a deep breath and said no John it wouldn\u2019t be okay. As much as I love you and Holly and more than happy for you guys are getting  engaged I don\u2019t want that done at my wedding but I\u2019d be more than happy to help you plan a separate event and I think Holly wouldn\u2019t be too thrilled to get proposed at someone\u2019s wedding. Holly had told me before that she found people who get engaged at people\u2019s weddings tacky. \n\nI told him that but he wouldn\u2019t budge. He got angry and said we were being selfish but not allowing him this one small favour and if the roles were reversed he\u2019d say okay in a heart beat. I reiterated to him that Holly wouldn\u2019t want this and she\u2019d want her own event. He kept saying you\u2019re lying you just don\u2019t want us to be engaged you just want all the attention to yourselves. This is where I might feel like I\u2019m the asshole. I blew up at him and called him tacky and cheap! I said us and our families aren\u2019t not shelling out thousands for you to propose at our wedding. It\u2019s embarrassing you can propose to Holly even a day after or day the before or even the day of but just not at my wedding or venue. Holly will cringe and find it embarrassing. He said he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d been friends with such selfish and rude people for all these years. My fianc\u00e9 reiterated everything I\u2019d said and then My fianc\u00e9 told him to leave and he left. \n\nNow it\u2019s awkward Holly has no idea what happened and we all had a trip booked for next month and now I don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m very upset with John and he hasn\u2019t apologised. I don\u2019t know what to tell Holly I don\u2019t want to lie to her but I don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise of her possible proposal.

NTA and i would reevaluate this friendship. this guy has possibly cost himself a friendship all because he cant take no for an answer, seems like he has some issues", "NTA. \n\nJohn's reaction is very weird, to blow up the friendship over this issue. If Holly talks to you, I would say you and your fiance had an argument with John, and if she wants to know more she should talk to John first. That way you won't spoil the proposal. Of course John will paint you in the worst light, but it's likely this friendship is over anyway.

Jake asked the DJ if he could play a \"special\" song just for then 1000 years by Christina Perri.  DJ said sure but he had two requests to do first.  DJ texted MOH who got the kids ready.
