In general, he is a pretty annoying, difficult guy but I am good at ignoring things and not letting them get to me. My wife is the youngest of 4 siblings, and everyone has always seen her like the baby of the family. NBD, pretty normal in a lot of families. However, now that we are all so close I have been able to watch their dynamic. Her dad treats her like a child. A few days ago I came home with snacks and he said \u201cgreat, snacks for the baby for recess\u201d. Yesterday we went to a park and there was playground and he told her \u201c awesome, a playground for the baby to go play\u201d. He constantly baby talks to her and every time he says a comment like that I remind him that she\u2019s 30 and married.\n\nThe issue is that my wife is fully embracing this behavior, and over the past 4 months she has gradually started acting more like a child. Today he made another comment while we were all in the car, and I sighed and opened the window. My wife noticed and said \u201cdad I\u2019m not a child\u201d his response was \u201c oh is my baby a young woman already\u201d.

I decided that I couldn\u2019t hold on to it any longer and I told her that I found her dynamic with her dad disturbing and unattractive.

Over the past 8 years I have told her that I hate that her older sister treats her like a child and doesn\u2019t give her the respect she deserves. My wife is an executive in a pretty big company, but her older sister treats her like she\u2019s still 5 and will not accept that my wife knows a lot more about some topics that she does.

It\u2019s just the first time I have been around it for a prolonged period of time.\n\nMy wife was obviously in shock that I said what I said and said that their relationship didn\u2019t come from a bad place, it was just the way they were with each other.

I told her that I miss my adult wife, which made her cry because she says she doesn\u2019t see it that way. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know if I crossed a line by criticizing their relationship or if it was ok for me to tell her how I truly feel about it.", "created_utc": 1673834014, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10d1t87/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_her_dynamic_with/", "score": 2880, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not even just pet names, which some people might not be used to but one could make a reasonable argument for being perfectly normal in an affectionate adult context.\n\nTalking about \"a playground for the baby\"? \"Snacks for recess\"? There are women your wife's age who (granted, not ideally) are grandmothers, and he's play-acting surprised at the idea that she's a \"young lady\"? (Hint: no, she's not . . . she's a FULLY GROWN WOMAN by any standard.) This is not a \"she's a baby of the family\" situation . . . her father is LITERALLY infantilizing her in a really concrete and psychologically concerning way. \n\nThis is so unhealthy. They are using a language of full-on infantilising fantasy and imaginary play to contextualise their father-daughter relationship, all the time, in everyday scenarios, around other people. This is not an occasional joke, it's literally how they relate to each other? As father and . . . baby girl? And not \"Babygirl\" like a nickname but actually BABY GIRL where he talks about her using the playground at the park? And she's a THIRTY YEAR OLD MARRIED EXECUTIVE?\n\nNope. Immediately no. And while normally I might have questioned your language in the sense of \"it's not her job to always be attractive to you\", I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU USED THOSE WORDS . . . because you were trying to use a very ADULT language to fully convey to her, \"We are in a grownup relationship, and what you are doing is destroying the tacit agreements that adults have in such relationships, as equals, as partners.\" You told her it was \"unattractive\" because it literally was destroying your ABILITY to be attracted to her as an adult that you love. Which is fair. And her crying? Was NOT fair. It was manipulative and . . . well, childlike. I would be concerned that you're right and she is falling into a really unhealthy pattern. You are NTA but I would be worried if I were you that this is a deeply unhealthy dynamic, and I would get him out of the house. They aren't good for each other.", "NTA. Sounds kinda creepy and gross to me. You did the right thing IMO. It is definitely not healthy for a father to treat his daughter like that when she\u2019s in her 30s and married.", "NTA - I\u2019m probably going to be in the minority and downvoted by the \u201che\u2019s her father\u201d crowd, but I\u2019m just getting out of a 17-year marriage where my wife always choose her family, especially her mom, who treated her poorly over me and our kids. When her mom wouldn\u2019t listen to her, I\u2019d get similar responses and when I\u2019d try to talk to her, I\u2019d get defensive conversations about how sensitive her mom was and how \u201cit was different for them/her relationship\u201d \u2026\n\nSo, NTA and try to break the cycle as soon as possible \u2026 if your wife is willing, get her into counseling, the infantilism that she feels is real and can be crippling. It\u2019s just as bad as being made to parent your parent.", "NTA but to be honest this coming for her Father more than her as she\u2019s already been conditioned at a young age. The solution would be to remove the FIL out the house or speak to him directly", "NTA\n\n>\u201c awesome, a playground for the baby to go play\u201d.  \n>  \n>\u201cgreat, snacks for the baby for recess\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201c oh is my baby a young woman already\u201d\n\nThese things are still weird to say even if they're jokes. I'm not a therapist or psychologist so I'm not sure if this is okay. Is it a culture difference? Are there others who are put off with it? Or is it only OP?", "Wow. This is so creepy. \n\nNTA\n\nIs it time to consider therapy for your wife? I'm not sure, I am not a therapist but infantilizing your wife in this way seems.... almost like ongoing grooming.", "NTA. His way of relating to her is creepy and disturbing.", "NTA.", "NTA. He\u2019s infantilizing her to undermine her, and it is disturbing. Especially if she\u2019s falling into habits that are childish as a result. He needs to move out. And she needs therapy.", "NTA for telling her how you feel. You should have open and honest conversations in the marriage. \nIf her behavior is slowly starting to conform to her family\u2019s expectations of the \u201cbaby\u201d, and she\u2019s exhibiting regressive behavior and speech, I\u2019d be uncomfortable too. \nBut, maybe find a way to talk first, and then, if no change is evoked go a bit more direct. \nTBH I\u2019d find it unattractive to have my adult SO acting childlike to a parent.", "NTA this sounds like ddlg stuff but it's her actual father and hopefully there's nothing sexual about it. I suppose it's something about her dad not being able to actually cope with the fact children grow up, but, well he will have to learn that he can still love her when she's an adult.", "Oh hell no, that ain\u2019t right. NTA, but could you elaborate on ways she \u201cplays into\u201d the child thing? Honestly a bit scared to ask\u2026", "NTA.  Lemme see if I have this straight.  For whatever reason, you FIL is living with you.  I assume something has gone very wrong with his life for this to happen.  Yet, he treats your wife like a baby.\n\nIt seems to me that in this case, he is the baby.  You might point that out to him.", "NTA \n\nShe is fine with her Dad saying \u201cyay a playground for the baby to go play\u201d. Ummm what? \n\nIt\u2019s weird she hasn\u2019t pulled them all up on it years ago. Unless she really enjoys being \u201cthe baby\u201d", "Judge rules - strange and unsettling behaviour. Nta.", "NTA - yeah this is slightly weird and as the spouse you should be able to raise issues. Don't think i would have gone in as strong with those words tho", "NTA if you have to live with it you\u2019re allowed to have an opinion", "NTA that would definitely put you off. \n\nGet your FIL out of your house. Your wife is getting used to it again and is acting in kind. It's like putting adults in a classroom, in no time they revert back to acting like kids. Get rid of the FIL", "I think you're using the word \"babies\" when you mean to use the word \"infantilizes\"", "NAH. FIL needs to move out asap.", "I think I'm gonna have to go NAH on this one. Is their relationship a bit icky? Hell yes. Is it okay for you to be weirded out by it? Most definitely. I don't know where you go from here tbh except to continue open and non judgemental communication with your wife and hope that she stops acting like a three year old.", "NTA. Your feelings are reasonable.", "**YTA** \\- But **only** for how you approached the situation. I believe at the core, *you are correct*.\n\nHere's how this could have gone down differently.\n\n\\- You could have addressed it with the FIL in a way that's deeper than \"she's too old for that.\" You most likely would have gained a deeper insight into their relationship, which would have helped you approach the topic with your wife in a more sensitive (and most importantly) informed way.\n\n\\- Ask questions rather than make assumptions. That is the most effective way to learn about a behavior so that it can be addressed and potentially changed.\n\n\\- The bond between your wife and her father is a special and positive one (albeit age inappropriate) and that should also be acknowledged and respected when you talk about the subject with your wife. She has lived more life with that man than you both have together, and thus there is a lot of history to learn - you can be a better partner to your wife by working with her on this issue, rather than attacking her with no plan of progress.\n\nYou owe your wife an apology, and a promise to talk about this in a more empathetic way.", "INFO: Genuine question, how has this dynamic affected your daily lives? Is your wife acting the same way with you now? Is she no longer doing things that she normally does because she\u2019s a \u201cbaby\u201d?", "I have to say ESH just because you handled the situations poorly. At the root of it all, you are correct imo and the whole thing is creepy and weird and you are right to bring it up. \n\nBut the fact that you admit you used specific vocabulary to get her attention is manipulative and treating her like the very baby you don't want to be married to.", "NTA. That would probably drive me crazy as well. It really doesn't sound like you were being mean about it either, just being honest about your feelings. It's probably best that FIL not live with you guys, as it's already impacting your marriage.", "INFO. It\u2019s fair that you think the way her family treats her is weird but I\u2019m leaning toward YTH here for one reason: your wife\u2019s relationship with her family doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem for any of them.\n\nYour wife has a very successful career and fully embraces her father\u2019s behavior/attitude toward her. From your story it\u2019s unclear if she is okay with the way her older sister treats her or if it\u2019s you who doesn\u2019t like it because you think she doesn\u2019t get \u201cthe respect she deserves.\u201d\n\nIf your wife DOES have a problem here, then maybe NAH.", "Yta. You strategically used those words to grab her attention when you could have said it in other ways. You know you're the asshole because you're trying to justify yourself for saying those exact words. \n\nI agree her dynamic with her dad is weird but you should dial the attitude back and find other ways to express yourself. Her dad came before you so good luck there.", "YTA - not for being bothered, and not for bringing it up BUT for being so harsh. \n\n Honestly I thought this post was going to head towards your wife being pissed off about Dads infantilizing attitude. \n\nIt sounds like You have been watching, thinking about, and getting weirded out by this for a while - but if you haven't had any conversations - as in sit down & talk conversations - this hit her out of the blue. The fact she's so upset and was in tears shows how this has affected her.  Yes it's important that she listen to you but that sounded pretty humiliating.  \n\nUnderstand that for your wife that really IS 'the way things are' of course changing that is a great option but people do tend to fall into patterns in families and often they don't see it.  \n\nAlso consider that she is an executive she might find this relationship somewhat relaxing ie she's not The Boss around her Dad, she can turn her high stress decision making brain off for a bit.  \n\nBut yes that does seem uncomfortable, of course everybody is some one's 'Child' but it's uncomfortable to be reminded 24/7 that the person your married to & sleeping with is somebodies 'Baby'.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No. Does it warrant your response in that way? No. \n\nI see where you and many other commenters are coming from, however I think this is more of a case of the youngest child and a father who can't see that his kid is grown up. Unfortunately, my dad is the same way and he does use similar langauge at times. I don't think it's creepy or infantilizing. It's more so a way for him to keep that relationship going the way it always has been. Maybe even force of habit. To me it's comforting and a sign that i will always be my parents kids no matter how old I get. That might've rankled me when I was younger, but now I cherish it. \n\nWhat's uncomfy for you is normal for your wife and coming at it the way you did could've felt like an attack at her and her relationship. The way you spoke could've to her, sounded like a perversion of her relationship with her father, almost as if you're trying to make her choose.\n\n I truly feel for her because when she says that she doesn't know any other way to be, she means it. Her relationship with her dad has most probably been that way her entire life. Out of all of this what you and other commenters are missing is what your wife feels about her relationship with her father and how he treats her. Is her father interjecting himself in your life? Causing a nuisance for you beyond this baby treatment? Without that info i would say YTA.", "I agree. You're NTA here, OP. I'm super close with my dad and he uses pet nicknames for my little sister and I that we have had since we were really little. If he knows we are traveling to come see him (my husband, 3 year old and I live about 6 hours away), he literally stays up until we arrive because he's always worried about us on the road. Stuff that he has done since I was little, like waiting up for me, or grabbing an empty glass off the table and putting it in the kitchen for me to wash... these things I think are normal for someone who grew up close with their dad like I did. \n\nBut they took this whole thing to a ridiculous level. Calling her \"baby,\" and talking about snacks for recess, a playground for the baby... that is BIZARRE! I expected to think YTA based solely on the title... and you're not. Not by a long shot. You need to get FIL out of your home before this whole bizarre hot mess destroys your marriage.", "I would argue against her crying reaction being purely manipulative. Yes, the father/daughter stuff is weird and gross, but it IS how she's been raised and it's the only way she's interacted with her father, whom she clearly loves.

Even though their partners were adults, the women just weren't attracted anymore because by refusing to care for themselves and tend to adult duties without fuss, the men came off as childish and immature.\n\nSo if your wife's dad is treating her like a young child, a baby even, and she's receptive to that, of course it's unattractive. Her body may be grown, but if her actions are increasingly childish in response to her family's treatment, part of you might compare her to an actual child. And unless you're a pedo (or into age roleplay), of course you don't find children (or childish adults) attractive.

It took a long time and a lot of pushback and some periods of occasional contact with my siblings to reach the point where I am treated as an equals who simply excels in different areas.\n\nThat said, you saw what happened when your wife pushed back on her dad calling her a baby. He acted like he acknowledged it but still refused to accept what she was saying, the \u2018oh is my baby a young woman\u2019 comment. \n\nHer family kind of sounds like assholes who decided who she was when she was 5 and has no desire to change their opinions or behavior.  Even when she grew up into a complex and intelligent adult. It is also a way to control her, by keeping her in the same spot with them she was in as a child. \n\nWhen they treat her like she\u2019s dumb and her thoughts don\u2019t matter she may fall back into the insecurities and powerlessness she felt as a child. They appreciate this because it makes it easier to push her into doing things that they don\u2019t want to do, like, I don\u2019t know, take full responsibility for housing their father. \n\nIt may also be how older sister deals with her insecurities about her younger sister\u2019s successes. By keeping her in her place she maintains control and superiority.\n\nWhen you talk to your wife about this tell her you understand that family dynamics are hard to shake, especially when everyone wants you to play the same part you played as a child. Explain to her that their behavior is like the emotional equivalent of asking her to wear a brown pantsuit and a green wig and reprise her role as tree #2 in her first grade play. \n\nBeing able to treat her like a baby is a win for them. It means they get to pat her on the head and tell her to be quiet because the adults are talking. The result of this is that they get to make the decisions and she feels like she just needs to do what she is told.\n\nYour wife may have reached a point where she just gave up and feels that by playing her part she takes back a small amount of power because it is her choice to do so.  Or on some level maybe she is afraid to push back because they might take their toys and go home. \n\nEven though that might be a win here, if your wife has spent her whole life trying desperately to win her family\u2019s approval she might be terrified that they will actually walk away and leave her alone.\n\nWhen you have this discussion really emphasize that she is an amazing adult and one you fell in love with. Explain that this behavior is unfair to her and the reason you feel so strongly about it is because you see it for what it is, a subtle or not so subtle put down of her brains and abilities.\n\nHonestly therapy wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea, to help her work through everything.  If that isn\u2019t possible right now for whatever reason, just being able to discuss this with you may help her sort it out. \n\nIt might make her feel validated to have someone acknowledge why this dynamic likely exists and that it is okay for her to push back on it because she is an adult an no amount of baby talk and snarky comments will change that. \n\nRather than make the discussion about you against her family, which may put her on the defensive, stick to discussing what is wrong with the behavior and the words.

It's definitely a relationship-killer to be so infantilized, and also be playing along with it.", "Similar situation here - my dad would NEVER. This is like\u2026a play.", "Same! The father is being creepy, and the husband was fine to point that out. I don't think the wife did anything wrong. She felt hurt and possibly embarrassed and her reaction was to cry. I have BPD and I break down crying about the stupidest things.", "Well said \ud83e\udd23", "#thatsmyfetish", "SAME!!!! I joke that my default response is crying! \n\nGet sad: \ud83d\ude2d\nGet happy: \ud83d\ude2d\nSee a cute puppy:\ud83d\ude2d", "I still disagree. \u201cI told her that I miss my adult wife, which made her cry because she says she doesn\u2019t see it that way\u201d\n\nHowever justified it is, I\u2019d argue that a bunch of people would cry if their SO told them that they aren\u2019t being an adult (aka calling your partner childish).\n\nThat\u2019s not manipulative, that\u2019s just a reaction. I think the word manipulation is not fitting here at all. I think it\u2019s important to recognize that the wife is the one who\u2019s been bullied into this her whole life. \n\nJust because she\u2019s 30 doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t cry when she get overwhelmed. Especially if she\u2019s been treated this way her whole life by her entire family. Having OP share all this information, no wonder she got slightly defensive by saying she didn\u2019t see it that way, and no wonder she cried. \n\nCrying isn\u2019t \u201cregressing to childlike emotions\u201d and just because she\u2019s a big executive doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t cry either?? Not to mention business discussions vs personal discussions with loved ones are COMPLETELY different.\n\nI\u2019m honestly confused how you\u2019ve gotten so many likes on your responses. I feel that your comments are very extreme and unnecessarily harsh towards OP\u2019s wife in a way that is completely unjustified. \n\nNAH.", "<<*in her personal life, to regress to childlike response*s>>\n\nThere is a phrase somewhere.  *Your parents(/family) know all your buttons to push, because they installed them.*\n\nThe problem here is that she has literally been programmed since infancy to behave a certain way with her family. \n\n I agree she needs to deal with it, but much of it happens on a sub-conscious (/pavlovian) level.  So she needs to have it pointed out to her just for her to see it.", "But that\u2019s what you did say? Your comment was written to be completely and fully interpreted as OP\u2019s wife is being manipulative and a baby for crying because she\u2019s too old and too successful to not tighten her bootstraps. \n\nWhat does she even need to take responsibility for right now? She got all of this kinda thrown on her, it\u2019s a huge thing to process. Maybe later, days, weeks, she could say something like, \u201clooking back now, I can really see your point and I now see that I deserve better than how I\u2019ve been treated\u201d.", "I was clearly taking the piss", "**I WISH YOURS WAS TOP COMMENT! YOU ABSOLUTELY NAILED IT!!!!!** \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4c", "Seriously. I would fight fire with fire. If he has a problem with it agree to stop if he does or he can't get the heck out of your house.", "Ok like. I'm not trying to be one of those Internet weirdos reading into stuff but. Is anyone else getting more sinister vibes from this than what's stated? Like an intentionally abusive/infantilism fetish to keep his daughter under his thumb type of thing. \n\nI'm fully aware that this is a stretch, and that since it's something I personally went through I'm likely just projecting. But that's how things are feeling to me", "Holy shit OP. This might almost be a \u201csetting up secret cameras\u201d situation to see what the hell is going on when you aren\u2019t there.", "The ones saying they don't need therapy are the ones that need it the most.", ">Those of us in therapy are in therapy to deal with the people that should be!\n\nQuoting you for how true it is!!", "I agree. Therapy has helped me so much.", "This! I've also noticed what I processed as a child, I sometimes have needed space to reprocess in different stages of adulthood. It's amazing to have a non biased ear that I know I'm not burdening. Highly recommended for all"]}
