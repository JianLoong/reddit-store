In general, he is a pretty annoying, difficult guy but I am good at ignoring things and not letting them get to me. My wife is the youngest of 4 siblings, and everyone has always seen her like the baby of the family. NBD, pretty normal in a lot of families. However, now that we are all so close I have been able to watch their dynamic. Her dad treats her like a child. A few days ago I came home with snacks and he said \u201cgreat, snacks for the baby for recess\u201d. Yesterday we went to a park and there was playground and he told her \u201c awesome, a playground for the baby to go play\u201d. He constantly baby talks to her and every time he says a comment like that I remind him that she\u2019s 30 and married.\n\nThe issue is that my wife is fully embracing this behavior, and over the past 4 months she has gradually started acting more like a child. Today he made another comment while we were all in the car, and I sighed and opened the window. My wife noticed and said \u201cdad I\u2019m not a child\u201d his response was \u201c oh is my baby a young woman already\u201d. That was too much for me. \n\nWhen we got home I was visibly upset and my wife asked me. I decided that I couldn\u2019t hold on to it any longer and I told her that I found her dynamic with her dad disturbing and unattractive. The reason why I used these two exact words is because I knew I had to make a strong point for her to actually listen. Over the past 8 years I have told her that I hate that her older sister treats her like a child and doesn\u2019t give her the respect she deserves. My wife is an executive in a pretty big company, but her older sister treats her like she\u2019s still 5 and will not accept that my wife knows a lot more about some topics that she does. So this is not new. It\u2019s just the first time I have been around it for a prolonged period of time.\n\nMy wife was obviously in shock that I said what I said and said that their relationship didn\u2019t come from a bad place, it was just the way they were with each other. I told her to please see my point and how I see it from the outside. She\u2019s really upset and hurt and says she doesn\u2019t know any other way to be with her dad. I told her that I miss my adult wife, which made her cry because she says she doesn\u2019t see it that way. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know if I crossed a line by criticizing their relationship or if it was ok for me to tell her how I truly feel about it.", "created_utc": 1673834014, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10d1t87/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_her_dynamic_with/", "score": 287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not even just pet names, which some people might not be used to but one could make a reasonable argument for being perfectly normal in an affectionate adult context.\n\nTalking about \"a playground for the baby\"? \"Snacks for recess\"? There are women your wife's age who (granted, not ideally) are grandmothers, and he's play-acting surprised at the idea that she's a \"young lady\"? (Hint: no, she's not . . . she's a FULLY GROWN WOMAN by any standard.) This is not a \"she's a baby of the family\" situation . . . her father is LITERALLY infantilizing her in a really concrete and psychologically concerning way. \n\nThis is so unhealthy. They are using a language of full-on infantilising fantasy and imaginary play to contextualise their father-daughter relationship, all the time, in everyday scenarios, around other people. This is not an occasional joke, it's literally how they relate to each other? As father and . . . baby girl? And not \"Babygirl\" like a nickname but actually BABY GIRL where he talks about her using the playground at the park? And she's a THIRTY YEAR OLD MARRIED EXECUTIVE?\n\nNope. Immediately no. And while normally I might have questioned your language in the sense of \"it's not her job to always be attractive to you\", I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU USED THOSE WORDS . . . because you were trying to use a very ADULT language to fully convey to her, \"We are in a grownup relationship, and what you are doing is destroying the tacit agreements that adults have in such relationships, as equals, as partners.\" You told her it was \"unattractive\" because it literally was destroying your ABILITY to be attracted to her as an adult that you love. Which is fair. And her crying? Was NOT fair. It was manipulative and . . . well, childlike. I would be concerned that you're right and she is falling into a really unhealthy pattern. You are NTA but I would be worried if I were you that this is a deeply unhealthy dynamic, and I would get him out of the house. They aren't good for each other.", "NTA. Sounds kinda creepy and gross to me. You did the right thing IMO. It is definitely not healthy for a father to treat his daughter like that when she\u2019s in her 30s and married.", "NTA - I\u2019m probably going to be in the minority and downvoted by the \u201che\u2019s her father\u201d crowd, but I\u2019m just getting out of a 17-year marriage where my wife always choose her family, especially her mom, who treated her poorly over me and our kids. When her mom wouldn\u2019t listen to her, I\u2019d get similar responses and when I\u2019d try to talk to her, I\u2019d get defensive conversations about how sensitive her mom was and how \u201cit was different for them/her relationship\u201d \u2026\n\nSo, NTA and try to break the cycle as soon as possible \u2026 if your wife is willing, get her into counseling, the infantilism that she feels is real and can be crippling. It\u2019s just as bad as being made to parent your parent.", "NTA but to be honest this coming for her Father more than her as she\u2019s already been conditioned at a young age. The solution would be to remove the FIL out the house or speak to him directly", "NTA\n\n>\u201c awesome, a playground for the baby to go play\u201d.  \n>  \n>\u201cgreat, snacks for the baby for recess\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201c oh is my baby a young woman already\u201d\n\nThese things are still weird to say even if they're jokes. I'm not a therapist or psychologist so I'm not sure if this is okay. Is it a culture difference? Are there others who are put off with it? Or is it only OP?", "Wow. This is so creepy. \n\nNTA\n\nIs it time to consider therapy for your wife? I'm not sure, I am not a therapist but infantilizing your wife in this way seems.... almost like ongoing grooming.", "NTA. His way of relating to her is creepy and disturbing.", "NTA.", "NTA. He\u2019s infantilizing her to undermine her, and it is disturbing. Especially if she\u2019s falling into habits that are childish as a result. He needs to move out. And she needs therapy.", "NTA for telling her how you feel. You should have open and honest conversations in the marriage. \nIf her behavior is slowly starting to conform to her family\u2019s expectations of the \u201cbaby\u201d, and she\u2019s exhibiting regressive behavior and speech, I\u2019d be uncomfortable too. \nBut, maybe find a way to talk first, and then, if no change is evoked go a bit more direct. \nTBH I\u2019d find it unattractive to have my adult SO acting childlike to a parent.", "NTA this sounds like ddlg stuff but it's her actual father and hopefully there's nothing sexual about it. I suppose it's something about her dad not being able to actually cope with the fact children grow up, but, well he will have to learn that he can still love her when she's an adult.", "Oh hell no, that ain\u2019t right. NTA, but could you elaborate on ways she \u201cplays into\u201d the child thing? Honestly a bit scared to ask\u2026", "NTA.  Lemme see if I have this straight.  For whatever reason, you FIL is living with you.  I assume something has gone very wrong with his life for this to happen.  Yet, he treats your wife like a baby.\n\nIt seems to me that in this case, he is the baby.  You might point that out to him.", "NTA \n\nShe is fine with her Dad saying \u201cyay a playground for the baby to go play\u201d. Ummm what? \n\nIt\u2019s weird she hasn\u2019t pulled them all up on it years ago. Unless she really enjoys being \u201cthe baby\u201d", "Judge rules - strange and unsettling behaviour. Nta.", "NTA - yeah this is slightly weird and as the spouse you should be able to raise issues. Don't think i would have gone in as strong with those words tho", "NTA if you have to live with it you\u2019re allowed to have an opinion", "NTA that would definitely put you off. \n\nGet your FIL out of your house. Your wife is getting used to it again and is acting in kind. It's like putting adults in a classroom, in no time they revert back to acting like kids. Get rid of the FIL", "I think you're using the word \"babies\" when you mean to use the word \"infantilizes\"", "NAH. FIL needs to move out asap.", "I think I'm gonna have to go NAH on this one. Is their relationship a bit icky? Hell yes. Is it okay for you to be weirded out by it? Most definitely. I don't know where you go from here tbh except to continue open and non judgemental communication with your wife and hope that she stops acting like a three year old.", "NTA. Your feelings are reasonable.", "**YTA** \\- But **only** for how you approached the situation. I believe at the core, *you are correct*.\n\nHere's how this could have gone down differently.\n\n\\- You could have addressed it with the FIL in a way that's deeper than \"she's too old for that.\" You most likely would have gained a deeper insight into their relationship, which would have helped you approach the topic with your wife in a more sensitive (and most importantly) informed way.\n\n\\- Ask questions rather than make assumptions. That is the most effective way to learn about a behavior so that it can be addressed and potentially changed.\n\n\\- The bond between your wife and her father is a special and positive one (albeit age inappropriate) and that should also be acknowledged and respected when you talk about the subject with your wife. She has lived more life with that man than you both have together, and thus there is a lot of history to learn - you can be a better partner to your wife by working with her on this issue, rather than attacking her with no plan of progress.\n\nYou owe your wife an apology, and a promise to talk about this in a more empathetic way.", "INFO: Genuine question, how has this dynamic affected your daily lives? Is your wife acting the same way with you now? Is she no longer doing things that she normally does because she\u2019s a \u201cbaby\u201d?", "I have to say ESH just because you handled the situations poorly. At the root of it all, you are correct imo and the whole thing is creepy and weird and you are right to bring it up. \n\nBut the fact that you admit you used specific vocabulary to get her attention is manipulative and treating her like the very baby you don't want to be married to.", "NTA. That would probably drive me crazy as well. It really doesn't sound like you were being mean about it either, just being honest about your feelings. It's probably best that FIL not live with you guys, as it's already impacting your marriage.", "INFO. It\u2019s fair that you think the way her family treats her is weird but I\u2019m leaning toward YTH here for one reason: your wife\u2019s relationship with her family doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem for any of them.\n\nYour wife has a very successful career and fully embraces her father\u2019s behavior/attitude toward her. From your story it\u2019s unclear if she is okay with the way her older sister treats her or if it\u2019s you who doesn\u2019t like it because you think she doesn\u2019t get \u201cthe respect she deserves.\u201d\n\nIf your wife DOES have a problem here, then maybe NAH.", "Yta. You strategically used those words to grab her attention when you could have said it in other ways. You know you're the asshole because you're trying to justify yourself for saying those exact words. \n\nI agree her dynamic with her dad is weird but you should dial the attitude back and find other ways to express yourself. Her dad came before you so good luck there.", "YTA - not for being bothered, and not for bringing it up BUT for being so harsh. \n\n Honestly I thought this post was going to head towards your wife being pissed off about Dads infantilizing attitude. \n\nIt sounds like You have been watching, thinking about, and getting weirded out by this for a while - but if you haven't had any conversations - as in sit down & talk conversations - this hit her out of the blue. The fact she's so upset and was in tears shows how this has affected her.  Yes it's important that she listen to you but that sounded pretty humiliating.  \n\nUnderstand that for your wife that really IS 'the way things are' of course changing that is a great option but people do tend to fall into patterns in families and often they don't see it.  \n\nAlso consider that she is an executive she might find this relationship somewhat relaxing ie she's not The Boss around her Dad, she can turn her high stress decision making brain off for a bit.  \n\nBut yes that does seem uncomfortable, of course everybody is some one's 'Child' but it's uncomfortable to be reminded 24/7 that the person your married to & sleeping with is somebodies 'Baby'.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m the youngest of the family and this dynamic isn\u2019t that unusual. Your FIL takes it to the extreme with his baby talk and your SIL takes it too far with her dismissive attitude towards your wife, but overall it\u2019s hard for some families to accept that the youngest is all grown up. It\u2019s hard to break the habits of a lifetime especially when the person most affected by that habit (your wife) isn\u2019t fighting it too hard.

Although it's never fun seeing your your wife cry. That baby talk would be a major turn-off to me as well.\n\nNext would be FIL and tell him to cut the baby talk out when you're around.

My mother has a similar thing with me (less creepy because I\u2019m a woman, but still a lot of baby talk and wishing she could hold me in her arms, etc) and I always regressed around her in a way I didn\u2019t like but felt powerless to do anything about. After a lot of therapy to deal with the underlying insecurity about my mom loving and accepting me as I am, I realized I had to trust that she will love me no matter what, and that I can\u2019t change my mom, but I can change my own behavior. Over time she\u2019s seen that we can have a close relationship as two adults and it has really improved our relationship in every way.

I suppose it could be a cultural difference, but it sounds like a bizarre family dynamic regardless. \n\nNTA, OP. Your wife needs some therapy, though.", "As someone into ddlg, can confirm.  I would be so weirded out to have this dynamic with my Dad.", "The older sibling Do NOT want him. We\u2019ve asked. We\u2019re working to resolve this ASAP", "So in your post you said your wife has been gradually acting more and more like a child with her dad... but there aren't actually any examples of that? \n\nI mean Dad is definitely deeply weird, but so far it's hard to say if your wife is at all ta here (other than perhaps not shutting the behavior down when you wish she would).", "Things like pouting when thing don\u2019t go her way, asking her dad for permission, asking her dad for help with everything (she\u2019s usually a self sufficient person) throwing tantrums is the most irritating to me, baby talking back to him. I asked her on a date a few nights ago and she invited her dad (I really just wanted to be alone with her).", "Yikes.", "Yikes indeed. Therapy is definitely needed here", "NTA. But this makes me really curious if she has been victimized by her dad and hasn\u2019t realized it or has suppressed it. She really needs to get away from her dad and into therapy for this because it\u2019s not normal. It almost feels like a fetish for him and because she\u2019s been conditioned to it she doesn\u2019t understand that she\u2019s being victimized by him over and over. Get him out of your house like yesterday.", "NTA that isn't just treating your wife like the baby of the family. That's gone into roleplay kink. And absolutely not something that one should do with a parent or an unwilling spouse.", "This is like age play but between a parent and a child and I just\u2026 ick.\n\nNTA", "Nta and that is super fucking creepy", "NTA thats weird... like they could make a show about it weird... like wtf weird. Props to you for holding it together that long.", "Kinda weird but Nta", "NTA at all. Is this guy suffering from some kind of age related mental health condition or something? Is he serious about this way of talking about/to his daughter? This seems absolutely bizarre!! I\u2019d be right creeped out with it going on too.", "NTA also just reading this made me extremely uncomfortable. I can't imagine experiencing this IRL, I am sorry OP.", "NTA \nBut also\u2026. Ewwww.\nDoes she atleast see whats wrong here? Is she willing to makes changes? \nDoes this kind of thing need therapy? I don\u2019t no. But it\u2019s creepy", "NTA \n\nHOLY FUCK SHIT. Kick him out, ban him from the house, get your wife in therapy right now. Her father is an abuser", "You mention she is an exec in a large company. Hypothetically- would she feel comfortable if her colleagues and employees were to witness how her father refers to her, and how she behaves in his presence? Would that seem acceptable to her? I'm guessing she'd be embarrassed, and if she wouldn't act like that around her colleagues why would she want to around her husband.", "Is it the most healthy? No. Does it warrant your response in that way? No. \n\nI see where you and many other commenters are coming from, however I think this is more of a case of the youngest child and a father who can't see that his kid is grown up. Unfortunately, my dad is the same way and he does use similar langauge at times. I don't think it's creepy or infantilizing. It's more so a way for him to keep that relationship going the way it always has been. Maybe even force of habit. To me it's comforting and a sign that i will always be my parents kids no matter how old I get. That might've rankled me when I was younger, but now I cherish it. \n\nWhat's uncomfy for you is normal for your wife and coming at it the way you did could've felt like an attack at her and her relationship. The way you spoke could've to her, sounded like a perversion of her relationship with her father, almost as if you're trying to make her choose.\n\n I truly feel for her because when she says that she doesn't know any other way to be, she means it. Her relationship with her dad has most probably been that way her entire life. Out of all of this what you and other commenters are missing is what your wife feels about her relationship with her father and how he treats her. Is her father interjecting himself in your life? Causing a nuisance for you beyond this baby treatment? Without that info i would say YTA.", "I agree. You're NTA here, OP. I'm super close with my dad and he uses pet nicknames for my little sister and I that we have had since we were really little. If he knows we are traveling to come see him (my husband, 3 year old and I live about 6 hours away), he literally stays up until we arrive because he's always worried about us on the road. Stuff that he has done since I was little, like waiting up for me, or grabbing an empty glass off the table and putting it in the kitchen for me to wash... these things I think are normal for someone who grew up close with their dad like I did. \n\nBut they took this whole thing to a ridiculous level. Calling her \"baby,\" and talking about snacks for recess, a playground for the baby... that is BIZARRE! I expected to think YTA based solely on the title... and you're not. Not by a long shot. You need to get FIL out of your home before this whole bizarre hot mess destroys your marriage.", "I would argue against her crying reaction being purely manipulative. Yes, the father/daughter stuff is weird and gross, but it IS how she's been raised and it's the only way she's interacted with her father, whom she clearly loves. If someone came after how I interacted with a father figure I love unexpectedly, I would personally be shocked to tears, especially if they doubled down. It doesn't necessarily mean she's being manipulative.", "[removed]", "Where my mind went when I read the post, then your comment.. yea. Should never go there for  father/daughter relationship.", "I think I threw up in my mouth", "Great question I wondered this too", "OP mentioned she's throwing tantrums, asking dad for permission, even trying to bring him on their date!", "Agreed.  He needs to divorce her if she chooses to not get help.", "Yeah.  Like his wife is acting like a literal child.", "If this was my life, I would do just as you say.  Divorce.  I don\u2019t want a child\nAs a spouse.", "He is turned off by watching his wife engage in some weird age-play kink with her father. That\u2019s more than a \u201cnuisance\u201d and more than enough for him to put his foot down.", "For real. My 8 year old can be a bit immature and I'm already taking the \"you'll always be MY baby, but you're not A baby, you're a big girl\" route cause im not trying to raise a useless adult.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Both for letting her have enough of a childhood that this is happening at eight and fit actually taking steps for her to grow into a strong woman!", "Ugh, thankyou! Infantalising a child can do serious damage. Props to you! A bloody responsible parent!", "And I think we know why.  They need to step up. This behaviour has to stop. It\u2019s beyond creepy. NTA", "\"Sane\" only in absolute medical terms. I know dads can coddle their daughters exaggeratedly a lot (I probably would be so to my daughter (s) lol) but this is actually insane. He literally treats her like a little child, an infant, while she's a 30 year old working adult doing a highly evaluated job! That goes beyond doting and straight to creepy grooming.", "....Good lord that's real f'd up. Those are some real bad psychological effects... definitely NOT healthy, AT ALL."]}
