The wedding went smoothly, apart from one guests dress preference, who we\u2019ll call Anna. Anna\u2019s mother sadly passed away in January this year. Her mother was the light of her life and ever since she passed, Anna has been understandably uptight and distant. I have helped Anna throughout her entire grieving time. We had been planning this wedding since December, and decided we wanted an ocean themed wedding. My family and I grew up on the seaside and have always been close to the ocean. I made it extremely clear to all of my bridesmaids that they were to wear blue, a coral pinky colour or pastel green. Everyone agreed and seemed to love my choices.\n\nAnna\u2019s mother always loved the colour dark, vibrant purple. Ever since then Anna would buy everything purple if there was a purple choice. Anna and me went for lunch a few weeks after the passing to catch up and support her. At the lunch, Anna asked me if she could please wear a purple dress to my wedding. I\u2019m not crazy about themes usually, but since this wedding was themed to support my familys tradition and considering my maid of honour was already going to be wearing a GORGEOUS pastel blue dress with purple and gold accent\u2019s, me and my husband who I decided to call and discuss the idea with him politely told her that we understand what she\u2019s going through, but we really want bridesmaids on theme. To this she looked hurt, and left lunch earlier than expected. \n\nI hardly heard from Anna until around 4 weeks after our lunch, despite my attempts at texting, phoning and even knocking on her door, but she\u2019d continue to shut me off. That was until she texted me \u201cWhat do you think of these dresses?\u201d And displayed many different purple dresses in photos. I kindly reminded Anna that she wouldn\u2019t be wearing a purple dress to my wedding. Anna was enraged. I tried to tell her that I understand her feelings but my wedding is my own special day. To this she blocked me.\n\nAnna unblocked me 2 days later, apologising for the way she acted. Well, when the wedding rolled around Anna showed up in a purple dress. I asked her why she had gone against my wishes and that she either had to change or leave. To this she told me to stop creating a scene and that I was being dramatic and disrespectful. Anna broke out in a screaming match and called me and my family \u201cInsensitive, selfish bastards.\u201d She was escorted out the door screaming.\nOnce the wedding had ended I recieves messages from Anna\u2019s family, friends and even Anna. They were all saying how Anna was going through a lot and that I was being an asshole.

At the same time though, it *is* your wedding.\n\nI always felt like forcing people to wear (or not wear) specific colors is a little silly. For example, I\u2019ve been married for 7 years, but only now in August are we having a wedding and my mom asked if not wearing white is a thing in the US and I told her it was, but I honestly don\u2019t really care. That\u2019s just my take though and I get that everyone is different which is why I said NTA. Again, it\u2019s *your* wedding. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a big deal. It\u2019s just a color.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t wrong of you or much of a jerk move because everyone is going to want their wedding to go their way. Especially considering the cost! I think there was room for some compromise though. Maybe she could have worn a purple similar to the one your MoH wore, you guys could have chosen a dress with a hint of purple, something like that. Some people just really lose it when a parent dies. My grandfather became an alcoholic when his mom died, so I guess that\u2019s why I feel bad for her. She\u2019s going kinda crazy though with the purple, so while usually I\u2019d say that she needs to chill, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s capable of it at the moment. Just going by the absolute meltdown she had at your wedding though (seriously not cool), I don\u2019t know if I would expect her to act\u2026normal.

I understand what you are saying which is why you are NTA, I guess I was just confused by the idea that you said change or leave, instead of telling her that if she wants to wear purple to honor her mother, she can do so as a guest. That compromise doesn't show up in your original post.", "NTA.\n\nGrief is a horrible thing - but her behaviour is not rational or healthy. I hope she gets some help dealing with it and I'm also very sorry your wedding had this stress on it. I don't think you were being unreasonable at all. Lots of people attend weddings with dresscodes and what have you after losing a loved one. You gotta keep on keeping on.", "Exactly, grief can bring people to their knees and they aren't themselves anymore. Sometimes they never are again. \n\nWhen I lost my husband, I couldn't see anything but my grief, except the anger I felt over the loss too. Having gone through that, I can accept that some selfishness and drama may be par for the course for awhile, maybe a long while. Now, the but..... BUT just because you can't contain yourself, doesn't mean other people have to deal with you. That's one of the things that makes extreme grief so isolating. Besides missing your dearest person, you are in such a state, that even mental health professionals have to clock out and tag someone else in.\n\nShe should have dropped out, or at the very, very least left when asked. I was told I was being an AH the day before the funeral, and while I still have a whole bunch of opinions about how I think it was absurd to have expected better of me, I walked away and called for a ride. You can't make other people understand your grief. And it's ok if you still need to wallow in your feelings, but it's just as ok for people not to be able to wallow with you. Like I said, grief is lonely.", "People grieve.. I didn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m saying special privileges. If OP said no at her wedding, op said no at her wedding. Be a guest and wear purple! You\u2019re a bridesmaid, you\u2019re one of the only people who have to listen to the BRIDE about what to wear that\u2019s isn\u2019t \u201cformal and not white please\u201d. This is ridiculous.", "You can be sympathetic to a person grieving but her grief does not take precedent over everyone else\u2019s feelings. If she couldn\u2019t wear a different color than purple she should have either stepped down and been a guest or not come. She was being extremely selfish and yes she was being immature.you can be grieving and still act inappropriately. Grief does not entitle you to act however you want.", "I am speaking as someone who lost both parents by 30. Her grief is real and not to be minimized by her actions were inappropriate and wrong. Honestly either herself or OP should have brought up stepping down as a bridesmaid because she was not mentally ready for that yet.", "I think what the poster meant to say is that grieving doesn't make you special and entitled to this kind of behavior. She's acting like she is the only person in the world to ever go through this, so she feels entitled to anything and everything she chooses. I don't think they meant to say that grieving itself is immature.\n\nI have lost my father to cancer in February and I am very much still hurting, but I would never in a million years feel entitled to my every whim because of it, and I would never make someone else's wedding about me and what I want. If anything that would sully my deceased father's memory, and now more than ever I want him to be proud of me.", "That\u2019s not true, you either misread or misunderstood their comment. I think you deliberately misunderstood but whatever. They meant that this woman is acting immature and using grief as an excuse.", ">People that act like her are immature and need to mature and come to terms with the fact that everything and everyone passes away.\n\nThat is what they said.  Not that grief is immature because everyone dies, but that grief doesn't give you carte blanch to act like an AH.  Stop projecting your own issues onto a ridiculous situation.", "Because we\u2019re surrounded by teenagers.", "I tell my son this all the time: You can\u2019t control your feelings but you *can* control how you act. She is absolutely allowed to be grieving but that doesn\u2019t mean she can behave however she likes. Her grief isn\u2019t immature, her actions are.", "If \"grief\" makes you into an inconsiderate bully you were already an inconsiderate bully. Grief just broke the mask.", ">But grief is not immature.\n\nOf course grief itself is not immature. But if her method of grieving involves refusing to wear the appropriate color to a wedding and then causing a scene,  than it is absolutely immature.\n\nHer saying I can't celebrate with you because of grief, mature.\n\nHer stepping down as a bridesmaid, mature.\n\nHer pitching a hissy fit over dress color, not mature.", "Grief isn\u2019t immature, and acting out of norm is pretty understandable when someone feels that their world is crashing down. It\u2019s also true that her *behavior* was immature. (I disagree with the commenter that called her immature.) We can have empathy and be understanding while still acknowledging that what she did was out of line", "No one is saying grieving.is immature\n We are saying the behavior she is exhibiting is immature, grief or not.", "Yes. There were definitely options the friend could have done instead of deliberate full deep purple.", "Aren\u2019t sexually themed posts against the rules?", "She said it like it was common knowledge. I had my first vomit inducing migraine because of it, wondering if this is what my friends are saying about me behind my back.", "Then she should have stepped down as a bridesmaid.", "And wearing a purple dress as a bridesmaid in her friend's wedding isn't going to change the fact that her mother is dead. If your grief is so overpowering that you literally can't think of anyone else, stay home and refuse all social engagements until you're feeling better.", "Literally right above my comment saying never tell someone grief is immature a poster says \u201cpeople like her need to mature and come to terms with the fact that everyone and everything passed away\u201d.", "I think we have heard from \"Anna\" lol", "I\u2019m in my 40s. This person is misreading the comment they so strongly object to. They\u2019re either willfully obtuse or projecting.", "Nah, grieving something like *the death of your mother* absolutely has the ability to make you into a crazy person. There's no need to be shitty by putting \"grief\" in quotes. It is a horrific and complex thing and can definitely fuck you up bad.", "Mhm, royal purple tends to stick out like a sore thumb agenst white and pastels. She would also be upstaging the bride", "Do you have any other friends that you could ask if they had heard the same rumor? That way you could at least figure if people are talking about you or if it\u2019s just her. I\u2019m so sorry I you have to go thru this. \u2764\ufe0f", "That means grieving maturely, not just grieving at all.", "This is somehow clothing related victim blaming", "Yes. By telling Anna \"you absolutely cannot wear purple to the wedding\" and Anna agreeing, OP should definitely have seen her friend going off the mental break down deep end and assumed she was definitely not going to listen. Probably should have preemptively banned her close friend from the wedding due to a suspicion she might be losing it.", "I did ask one and she said she said she\u2019s never thought it or ever heard it discussed. Thank god because cheating is the worst, especially in this context. Shitty Shelly out there doing her shit stirring.", "There\u2019s really no victim here. Really, it\u2019s a dress. If this happened to me I would give my friend a big hug, tell her I was glad to see her, and that I hoped she would understand not being in bridal party photos.", "Every bride I\u2019ve ever known,  myself included, has seen every wedding party member\u2019s attire prior to the wedding day. It\u2019s part of wedding planning. OP chose to trust the person who had only shown her choices she said no to. Why did she do that??? It\u2019s a valid question. \n\nBut none of this makes the person I\u2019m responding to saying grieving is not okay because everyone dies. I can only assume that the only death the person has experienced is a goldfish. Somehow this has turned into a forum in which its declared that grief is never okay. And the bunch of literal and emotional 14 year olds that make up this sub agree.", "That\u2019s good for you. The wedding isn\u2019t and will never be about her. It\u2019s about the people getting married.", "They are literally blaming the bride for something someone else did", "Are you saying grief over the loss of a pet isn't real /s"]}
