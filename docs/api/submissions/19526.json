The wedding went smoothly, apart from one guests dress preference, who we\u2019ll call Anna. Anna\u2019s mother sadly passed away in January this year. Her mother was the light of her life and ever since she passed, Anna has been understandably uptight and distant. I have helped Anna throughout her entire grieving time. We had been planning this wedding since December, and decided we wanted an ocean themed wedding. My family and I grew up on the seaside and have always been close to the ocean. I made it extremely clear to all of my bridesmaids that they were to wear blue, a coral pinky colour or pastel green. Everyone agreed and seemed to love my choices.\n\nAnna\u2019s mother always loved the colour dark, vibrant purple. Ever since then Anna would buy everything purple if there was a purple choice. Anna and me went for lunch a few weeks after the passing to catch up and support her. At the lunch, Anna asked me if she could please wear a purple dress to my wedding. I\u2019m not crazy about themes usually, but since this wedding was themed to support my familys tradition and considering my maid of honour was already going to be wearing a GORGEOUS pastel blue dress with purple and gold accent\u2019s, me and my husband who I decided to call and discuss the idea with him politely told her that we understand what she\u2019s going through, but we really want bridesmaids on theme. To this she looked hurt, and left lunch earlier than expected. \n\nI hardly heard from Anna until around 4 weeks after our lunch, despite my attempts at texting, phoning and even knocking on her door, but she\u2019d continue to shut me off. That was until she texted me \u201cWhat do you think of these dresses?\u201d And displayed many different purple dresses in photos. I kindly reminded Anna that she wouldn\u2019t be wearing a purple dress to my wedding. Anna was enraged. I tried to tell her that I understand her feelings but my wedding is my own special day. To this she blocked me.\n\nAnna unblocked me 2 days later, apologising for the way she acted. Well, when the wedding rolled around Anna showed up in a purple dress. I asked her why she had gone against my wishes and that she either had to change or leave. To this she told me to stop creating a scene and that I was being dramatic and disrespectful. Anna broke out in a screaming match and called me and my family \u201cInsensitive, selfish bastards.\u201d She was escorted out the door screaming.\nOnce the wedding had ended I recieves messages from Anna\u2019s family, friends and even Anna. They were all saying how Anna was going through a lot and that I was being an asshole.

At the same time though, it *is* your wedding.\n\nI always felt like forcing people to wear (or not wear) specific colors is a little silly. For example, I\u2019ve been married for 7 years, but only now in August are we having a wedding and my mom asked if not wearing white is a thing in the US and I told her it was, but I honestly don\u2019t really care. That\u2019s just my take though and I get that everyone is different which is why I said NTA. Again, it\u2019s *your* wedding. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a big deal. It\u2019s just a color.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t wrong of you or much of a jerk move because everyone is going to want their wedding to go their way. Especially considering the cost! I think there was room for some compromise though. Maybe she could have worn a purple similar to the one your MoH wore, you guys could have chosen a dress with a hint of purple, something like that. Some people just really lose it when a parent dies. My grandfather became an alcoholic when his mom died, so I guess that\u2019s why I feel bad for her. She\u2019s going kinda crazy though with the purple, so while usually I\u2019d say that she needs to chill, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s capable of it at the moment. Just going by the absolute meltdown she had at your wedding though (seriously not cool), I don\u2019t know if I would expect her to act\u2026normal.

Again, my condolences.", "I don't know how to do quotes, but they reposted this comment:\n\"Everyone has the potential to be immature when our mother passes away.\"", "There must be tentacles!  And plushie eels. This made me search and I'm happy to say that there are several Squishmallow eels!", "Or, idk, for one day not wear purple because it won't kill her or take her love from her mother. That this was her hill to die on shows how early in the grieving process she is, though.", "I think that is just it. Many people have the misconception that their level of grief equates to how much the deceased was loved. Crying, breaking down, wearing purple in public for five months doesn't mean she loved her mother any more than if she didn't do those things. Anna needs to give herself permission to live, while still acknowledging she misses her Mom.", "My wedding is going to be on a chartered whale watching boat and I think I\u2019m going to steal this idea ommmggg I\u2019m dying", "Her assigned blue dress had purple and gold accents.  It already was a compromise.  Anna was grieving but also suffering from Main Character Syndrome.  Her DISPLAY of grief was much more important than the wedding.  She could use some therapy and some self-reflection.", "OP doesn\u2019t have to compromise on shit with anyone who isn\u2019t the person she is marrying. Tf is this entitled mindset.", "The fuck is wrong with all the commenters?\n\nHuuuuge YTA. This may come as a shocker to entitled Americans but you do *not* get to dictate to your guests what to wear. You have circumvented a kind gesture of your bridesmaid to her recently deceased mother for your \"theme\".\n\nI hope in the future you learn to appreciate what is important in life. And learn to minimize what is unimportant.", "Yep.  Yta.\n\nYou claim this is a friend, close enough to make her a bridesmaid. And yet, you couldn't find a purple that could let her remember her mother.\n\nNext time, after your divorce when you go to get remarried, only have bridemaids who know you really don't value them as friends, so when a similar thing happens they can expect this from you", "Agreed. I'm really worried about her. But just because she's suffering doesn't mean she gets to make up her own rules for other people's weddings. \n\nHer family isn't helping by supporting this. She needs professional help. I hope she gets it.", "That may have been your mistake. In her shoes, I'd probably have worn purple too. But I'm also aware that my unwillingness to let other people dictate what I wear is not compatible with being a bridesmaid in a wedding of someone who cares about the current societal conventions around weddings and the power given to the couple to be wed. So I'm not bridesmaid material for people like you, and neither was she.", "Then why did you not offer this to her when she come in purple dress? It would have at least been an attempt to keep good relationship, but instead you chose to not seem rude and become rude.", "Indeed.  Needing to wear nothing but her mom\u2019s favorite color and having this kind of reaction to being told no suggests that her grief is completely overwhelming her, and causing significant disruption to her ability to function.  That\u2019s normal for a while, but by 5 months in, you generally expect the bereaved to be able to start regaining the ability to function normally in society at least some of the time or excuse themself when they cannot.", "Ooof, imagine if she tried to turn it into that and blindsided op with it...", "Agreed. She will never be \"over\" the loss but she does need to be able to move forward through the grief. She can't. She's paralyzed. She thinks this wearing purple thing is somehow keeping her mother from being gone. When she was called out on that, she was being called out on her fantasy and confronted with reality. It's a very serious problem. She's not behaving rationally because she isn't rational. \n\nOP, I'm so sorry that you're having to witness this. I'm sure it's very hard for you.", "I had to wear a teal dress as a flower girl in the mid 90s.", "Oof. Nothing gives you \"a free pass.\" However, most adults understand, from personal experience, that people around you are not always on their best. Sometimes, we mess up and do incredibly stupid stuff. Being in pain can eff you up. There's also a difference between someone who is consistently abusive or selfish and someone who is behaving out of character after a loss.\n\nYour friends will go through events like that, and so will you. If you manage to persevere and say \"hey, we cannot have that, but know that I am here and hope we can reconcile in the future because I really care about you\" you have a possibility to preserve the friendship and maybe help the other person start healing.", "Well, to be fair, it has been 5 months. Deaths like that are difficult to get past. I still think the op isn't unreasonable, and afaik there's no mention of the jewelry as an optional alternative. Like to an extent, I think some empathy to the (probably ex) friend for what she's going through, even though she really should see a therapist to help her process her grief.", "I'm not saying the friend isn't an asshole in this situation, but she's 5 months out of having her mother just gone, it's ok for her to still be grieving. She's honoring her mother as part of her own, personal grieving, she's just taking it too far.\n\nA small purple necklace, bracelet, earrings or whatever should have, theoretically, been sufficient, it's the friend here who doesn't seem to have been willing to even try to suggest these things.\n\nEdit: the *op* suggested these and the friend didn't think it was sufficient, which is a total jerk move, even for the bereaved.", "Playing \u201cPoor unfortunate souls\u201d as the bride walks down the aisle", "Oh you're way correct here. \n\nBut people also grieve very differently, the purple might be that she feels closer to her lost mom there. She certainly needs grief counseling to get on with her life, but the judgement of the purple I don't think is as warranted as a lot of people are saying, even if she's taking it too far.", "The blue dress with purple accents was for the maid of honor, not for this specific friend. \nStill, NTA.", "I mean, it sounds like that was just the dress well before her mother died, so not a compromise, just like what it should have been.\n\nI'm not saying the friend isn't an asshole here, I'm saying the friend could have tried to comprise here, which it doesn't sound like she did.", "No, the MOH's dress was blue with purple and gold. Anna was a bridesmaid.", "Exactly. While I didn\u2019t have a theme for my wedding, I still wanted my photos to look nice. That\u2019s why most brides have their bridesmaids wear cohesive similar colors/dresses, if not the exact same dress. For the aesthetics. \n\nIf anything bridesmaid could have changed after the wedding/start of the reception. That would have been a more reasonable request. \n\nIt\u2019s something I actually suggested to a bride friend of mine who\u2019s sister didn\u2019t want to wear a dress, but rather pants. After the initial welcoming of the bridal party/bride & groom, quietly slips away to put on a dressy pant suit. Or in this case, a purple dress.", "That is an interesting take that seems somewhat directed as the couple in question but hey honestly you seem like you know yourself well enough to say no to something like this so good for you.\n\nUnfortunately the woman in question did not and had a really challenging time communicating that fact.", "Yes, that's what I am saying too. I don't think the OP is TA, really. But I can't help thinking that handling the problem in a way that didn't lead to screams and tears lay as much in the OP's power as the bridesmaid's. \n\nThis is more about philosophy around \"what do we do if we're right about something with no ethical substance in the world\". The OP was in the right. But she had no ethical imperative to act, as the color of a dress doesn't cause any actual harm (as long as it's not a wedding dress, or another intentional choice that upstages the bride). If you squint you can find plenty of purples in the ocean too. Even if you don't squint, the OP had a choice - to leave it be during the wedding and shun / go LC with the friend later; or to force the issue there and then. My choice would have been different, and what I advocate to young people is different, which reflects a difference in values.", "Bingo!", "Bridesmaids all carry a plushie eel instead of a bouquet. On Halloween of course. Start planning now cuz we're all coming", "While you aren't wrong, if it's part of her healing process, something small like jewelry isn't too much imo. But the direction the friend went is too much so idk.", "NTA. Anna is unwell mentally. You did nothing wrong. Given her aggressive outburst that this wasn't really about her dead mother but more about her getting her own way.", "\u201cPurplest purple that ever purpled\u201d\u2026.I laughed way too hard at this..", "You have no idea how much autocorrect fought me on that phrase!", "Even a purple pashmina to throw over the dress after the ceremony and photos, to really purple it up. \n\nAnna is going full Queen Victoria here, only in purple instead of black. Victoria did not set aside her black mourning dress even for her own children\u2019s weddings. But then again she was Queen, not a bridesmaid.", "I was thinking the same thing. A dark purple necklace would look just fine with a pastel blue dress.", "If it was just about wearing something purple, she could have worn purple underneath, or purple jewellery - honouring her mum without being visible.\n\nThe way she did it was wilfully antagonistic.", "Start wearing purple, wearing purple,  Start wearing purple for me now... \n\nGogo Bordello \n\nI wonder if this is the bridesmaid's new favourite tune?"]}
