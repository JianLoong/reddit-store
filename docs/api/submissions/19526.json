The wedding went smoothly, apart from one guests dress preference, who we\u2019ll call Anna. Anna\u2019s mother sadly passed away in January this year. Her mother was the light of her life and ever since she passed, Anna has been understandably uptight and distant. I have helped Anna throughout her entire grieving time. We had been planning this wedding since December, and decided we wanted an ocean themed wedding. My family and I grew up on the seaside and have always been close to the ocean. I made it extremely clear to all of my bridesmaids that they were to wear blue, a coral pinky colour or pastel green. Everyone agreed and seemed to love my choices.\n\nAnna\u2019s mother always loved the colour dark, vibrant purple. Ever since then Anna would buy everything purple if there was a purple choice. Anna and me went for lunch a few weeks after the passing to catch up and support her. At the lunch, Anna asked me if she could please wear a purple dress to my wedding. I\u2019m not crazy about themes usually, but since this wedding was themed to support my familys tradition and considering my maid of honour was already going to be wearing a GORGEOUS pastel blue dress with purple and gold accent\u2019s, me and my husband who I decided to call and discuss the idea with him politely told her that we understand what she\u2019s going through, but we really want bridesmaids on theme. To this she looked hurt, and left lunch earlier than expected. \n\nI hardly heard from Anna until around 4 weeks after our lunch, despite my attempts at texting, phoning and even knocking on her door, but she\u2019d continue to shut me off. That was until she texted me \u201cWhat do you think of these dresses?\u201d And displayed many different purple dresses in photos. I kindly reminded Anna that she wouldn\u2019t be wearing a purple dress to my wedding. Anna was enraged. I tried to tell her that I understand her feelings but my wedding is my own special day. To this she blocked me.\n\nAnna unblocked me 2 days later, apologising for the way she acted. Well, when the wedding rolled around Anna showed up in a purple dress. I asked her why she had gone against my wishes and that she either had to change or leave. To this she told me to stop creating a scene and that I was being dramatic and disrespectful. Anna broke out in a screaming match and called me and my family \u201cInsensitive, selfish bastards.\u201d She was escorted out the door screaming.\nOnce the wedding had ended I recieves messages from Anna\u2019s family, friends and even Anna. They were all saying how Anna was going through a lot and that I was being an asshole.

At the same time though, it *is* your wedding.\n\nI always felt like forcing people to wear (or not wear) specific colors is a little silly. For example, I\u2019ve been married for 7 years, but only now in August are we having a wedding and my mom asked if not wearing white is a thing in the US and I told her it was, but I honestly don\u2019t really care. That\u2019s just my take though and I get that everyone is different which is why I said NTA. Again, it\u2019s *your* wedding. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a big deal. It\u2019s just a color.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t wrong of you or much of a jerk move because everyone is going to want their wedding to go their way. Especially considering the cost! I think there was room for some compromise though. Maybe she could have worn a purple similar to the one your MoH wore, you guys could have chosen a dress with a hint of purple, something like that. Some people just really lose it when a parent dies. My grandfather became an alcoholic when his mom died, so I guess that\u2019s why I feel bad for her. She\u2019s going kinda crazy though with the purple, so while usually I\u2019d say that she needs to chill, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s capable of it at the moment. Just going by the absolute meltdown she had at your wedding though (seriously not cool), I don\u2019t know if I would expect her to act\u2026normal. She should have stayed home.\n\nSorry that happened on your wedding day though. That really sucks, especially since she seems like a close friend.", "YTA, you do know coral comes in lots of colours?

OP did tell Anna that she could wear purple accessories.", "Yeah unfortunately the world keeps on spinning even when you feel like it should have stopped. Grief is a powerful emotion for sure but it definitely sounds as though she needs some professional help to cope because that's not sounding good...\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA, she used her grief as a weapon to get you what you wanted. Then everyone noticed her purple dress.", "Your pov is entirely valid. It's not just the colour - it's ignoring you and making a scene. \n\nBut if she wasn't like that before the loss of her mum, maybe don't cut her out now or go nuclear. It's understandable if you need some distance (or even decide that you're too hurt), but the girl will eventually get around. Depending on what you want, there can be a future for you two so keep that in mind.", "Why because you can\u2019t stand being called out on being a shit person? You did her a favor because no one want to be friends with a garbage person that sleeps with her friends husband.", "I agree. It\u2019s very common here in the UK for the bride to choose the bridesmaids dresses. Many brides will allow the bridesmaids to have an input on the colour/style and it\u2019s not unusual for the bridesmaids to choose their own jewellery and/or shoes as long as they match the theme or colour code.", "Yeah, I get that. And it\u2019s true that she could have. She\u2019s not in her right mind though. I don\u2019t mean that as an excuse for her, but rather as I literally don\u2019t think she thought of that as an option because she probably wasn\u2019t thinking about the wedding logistics at all. It\u2019s also hard for me to put myself in your shoes because I don\u2019t understand the whole color coordinated thing or the importance of it because I feel like it doesn\u2019t take away from the wedding itself, but if it\u2019s important to you then it should be important to your wedding party.", "*You may have help Anna, but you did not walk in her shoes. The lost was not yours to bear it was her. It has changed her. There is a difference.*", "No but demanding special privileges at someone\u2019s wedding because someone died is immature", "The friends behavior *is* immature. It's unfortunate that she lost her mother yes. But loss is a part of life and you can't make it other people's issue and act like an inflammatory brat.", "I completely understand the loss is an unbearable situation for Anna, but as I\u2019ve said multiple times I have supported her through everything and we are trying to get her the needed help. I wish she could have respected me and my husbands wishes a bit more but there was many options for Anna, she could have wore a purple bag, hairclip. Just not a purple dress. Or she could have stepped down as a bridesmaid and became a guest in order to wear purple.", "You are not a nice or empathetic person obviously. Just because everyone dies doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t grieve. And it is a normal response to the loss of someone very close. It\u2019s also not common anymore to lose a parent in your early 30s. And just moving on like it never happened in five months is not normal. As I said, she should have been more cooperative about the bridesmaid dress but extrapolating that to she shouldn\u2019t be grieving because everyone dies is cold and cruel. \n\nThis whole thing is also on OP. How did she never ask to see the dress prior to the wedding?", "It\u2019s been around five months. She should have cooperated with the bride\u2019s wishes for the wedding. But grief is not immature. And at five months this wouldn\u2019t even qualify as prolonged grief.", "FWIW I agree with you. My sister passed unexpectedly. We weren't close but the whole thing was super traumatic because of how it happened and how it affected the family after. I would NEVER try and make someone else's day about my dead family member. Wouldn't even cross my mind. Your friend needs a grief counselor, and I don't blame you for how you handled it. \n\nNTA", "*The color purple holds a significant meaning in her heart. It is what is left of her mother who no longer walks among us. She will never see her or speak to her again like you who still have your mother to go to.*", "Anna showed her multiple dresses. OP said no every time.", "OP made it very clear purple was out. And please point out where anyone said she shouldn't be grieving?", "Nobody said \"grieving is immature\".", "If your grief is such that you throw a screaming fit at being unable to wear a color- you need professional help and therapy, not to be coddled and indulged.", "I totally get it holds a place in her heart but there are many other places Anna is able to wear purple. There are soo many dresscoded weddings in todays society and the fact the colour holds a special place in her heart isnt justification for her apologising and making it seem like she wasnt going to wear purple, just to continue to do so against I and my familys wishes.", "But this isn\u2019t mother\u2019s second funeral. This is very definition of irrelevant. If Anna is not in a place to behave appropriately during her grief, she shouldn\u2019t go to others\u2019 events until she can behave appropriately.", "Well, that\u2019s insane. My grandfather was my favourite person and I wore a lot of his old clothes around after he died, but I never insisted that the rest of the universe hang it\u2019s head with me \u2014 this was my burden, and wearing his favourite shirt made *me* feel better, but life does get to go on. Imagine how lonely I would be now if I told all my friends no one is allowed to ever be happy about anything again, we wear blue, drink Budweiser, watch westerns and we can only exclusively talk of baseball \u2014 or I will throw a *screaming fit at your wedding.* How shameful, I wonder if her purple-loving mother would want all this commotion started over her.", "Yet she never saw an appropriate dress and somehow didn\u2019t see this coming??? I would have seen an appropriate dress by the wedding date or asked her not to be in the wedding party. OP didn\u2019t do that then was surprised she showed up in the wrong color.", "Thisss. The friend just shouldn\u2019t have gone. She clearly wasn\u2019t in the right headspace to be there knowing that she was gonna start shit by wearing that dress. I feel bad for her, I really do, but you don\u2019t show up to an incredibly expensive and most important day of someone\u2019s life doing something they asked you not to do. Or in her case, wearing something they asked you not to wear. Either she didn\u2019t think about it because she\u2019s going insane or she didn\u2019t care. Or both. Personally, I don\u2019t understand the color coordinating thing, but it doesn\u2019t really matter because it\u2019s not my wedding. Even if the friend thought it was silly or doesn\u2019t understand OP\u2019s reasons, it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t respect it."]}
