The way our building works is that to get into a room, you need to unlock two doors. One door into our hallway, and then one door into our actual room. My roommate in general sucks, he treats our room like a mini frat house. Part of this is having an open room that any of his frat brothers can come into whenever. So he never locks the door to our room and props open the door to our hallway. I have never been okay with this. He leaves the door unlocked and open to anyone when neither of us are there, overnight, and just whenever. I have come home after a long weekend with both of our doors either propped open or left unlocked and he did not come back to the room for another full day.\n\nI have on multiple occasions walked into our room and just random fucking dudes have been in my room and idk if they're friends of his or just random people that have stumbled into our room. We're not in the greatest place. There have been multiple muggings on campus and with recent events like what happened in Idaho, I am not comfortable with keeping our room unlocked like this.\n\nAs since I moved back on campus following winter break I have been locking our door every time I notice it's unlocked. Because he leaves it unlocked, he tends to never take his key with him whenever he leaves. Last night, I was going out with some friends and planned on getting very drunk so I was going to be spending the night elsewhere so I didn't have to drive home. He was gone with I left and it was around 11pm. I saw his keys on our table and I locked both doors. When I got back at around 8am, he and two of his friends were asleep in the hallway. Apparently, they woke up our hallmates and got them to unlock the door and tried to wake me up. To get me to unlock the door, but I wasn't there.\n\nHe was pissed off at me for locking the door while he was gone. I told him that I'm not going to apologize for locking our door when no one was there. I know intentionally doing this was kinda fucked, but why would I leave our door unlocked without anyone in the room for God knows how long?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673545013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a5h31/aita_for_intentionally_locking_my_roommate_out/", "score": 607, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fire safety and personal security are valid concerns. It is probably difficult to get approved for insurance on personal items if your room mate keeps propping the door open.", "NTA, despite the knowledge that he'd be locked out. You can't be expected to leave everything you own open to easy theft by any damn person who might come wondering by.\n\nHell, you might even be murdered by some crazy. \n\nGet the administration involved if he keeps it up.", "NTA but please address this with your RA before something terrible happens.

Especially in a dorm.  He needs to start being held accountable for leaving the one thing that he needs to get in and out of the room/hallway.

A couple of girls woke up to a drunk man they didn't know standing in their room.

My college took safety very seriously and they had the handyman there within an hour in the  middle of the night to change the code.", "NTA. Your roommate is an asshole. Talk to the resident advisor and demand a room change. Snitch on his underage drinking.", "NTA.  As several others have suggested, go to your RA or to someone with some authority in your university housing department.  What OP's doing is unacceptable.  OP has a right to some basic privacy, security and simple peace of mind.", "NTA. Get him kicked out of dorms for violating the security rules.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA because it sounds like you\u2019ve never communicated your concerns or set any boundaries until you chose to knowingly leave him locked out of the room. Why don\u2019t you just have a conversation with him? \n\nYou said you don\u2019t live in the greatest area so why would you lock him out of a safe space that is partially his instead of confronting the situation like an adult?\n \nI understand that it is frustrating, obviously, and your possessions are at risk but there are appropriate ways to deal with it. I would add to your post if you have spoken with him or your RA prior to this event.\n\nEDIT: for clarity", "ESH", "NTA for wanting him to lock the door but your solution to the problem is a bit Ashish. There must be a more mature solution", "That's what I was going to suggest. Leaving the hallway door unlocked puts everybody there at risk. And there may be rules for the dorm about no overnight visitors. Plus, if someone in authority speaks to him, he's more apt to listen.", "Great minds think alike. As I\u2019m reading I\u2019m like \u2018I bet the RA is going bonkers trying to figure out who keeps propping the door open.\u2019 I believe, and I could be wrong, that voiding a basic security measure like keeping the hallway door open instead of closed & locked is grounds for eviction.", "\u2026in the moment he left and locked the door..was he supposed to bail on his plans cause his moron roommate left his keys? Not his problem he secured to the room like a normal person does..the roommate and his friend could\u2019ve figured out a place to stay but just chose the hall. if he has so many frat friends why not stay with them..he decided to be lazy just like him not locking the door", ">Leaving the hallway door unlocked puts everybody there at risk.\n\nTHIS! I was in Vegas at a work convention and a co-worker was going to swing by my room so we could go down together. I left my door slightly propped open using that little swing latch thing. I thought nothing of it. \n\nAbout five minutes later a big burly man barged into my room, freaking me out! Lucky for me, he was security and had noticed the door.

The update OP provided was bonkers.

And the reason she was using OP\u2019s office was to avoid anyone recognizing her actual office during meetings.

What I don\u2019t get is that why haven\u2019t you involved the RA? Makes this not seem real at all. He also could have engaged the RA and had the room unlocked.

Anyway, one night someone came in and stole several of their laptops left in the living room area while they were sleeping. Building had always seemed safe and security was fairly decent with a day front-desk person and keycard access required for front door, elevator, and all the wings of the building. They never found out whether some rando got access or another student did it. Anyway, this shite definitely happens in dorms, even in ones that seem pretty safe.
