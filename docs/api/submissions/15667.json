I got pregnant accidentally when we started the course, i wouldve been able to finish it but after my partners mother forced us to live with her, she harassed my aunt, told her i was pregnant then kicked us out and left us homeless. so we really had no choice but to come and live back here. \n\ngod im crying so bad right now.", "Edit: changed to YTA. Original comment in brackets.\n\n\nI just saw a comment where OP said they do intend to use the kitchen. That makes you the asshole. It's a shared space, and by the sound of it, it is an established routine that each person cleans for one week. Just because you didn't use it these last few weeks, doesn't give you a free pass, because what's going to happen if you make a huge mess next week and say, \"oh but it's not my turn to clean...\" ? \n\nIt's like asking Netflix to refund your subscription because you didn't happen to watch anything this month.\n\n(E S H because you should have agreed on chore sharing before you moved in. \n\nIf this is a place with multiple roommates and an established \"take turns cleaning the whole place each week\" routine prior to your arrival, they should have told you about it before you committed to moving in, and you should have asked.\n\nIf you've just established a new house share situation together, you should have all talked about it.\n\nIf you already knew about this routine and then decided that it's not fair to expect you to clean the kitchen because you happened not to use it yet, then you are definitely TA.)", "YTA\n\nI guarantee you use the kitchen. Maybe not as mcuh as the others, but you use it.\n\nIt's common space.\n\nYour roommates are tired, too.\n\nAnd they're tired of you shirking household cleaning.", "He said he eats in his room, puts the empty containers in the trash in his room, and takes out the trash from his room. If he really never sets foot in the kitchen, which it sounds like, then he shouldn't have to clean it beyond maybe a quick floor sweep and counter wipe down on the day when it's his turn. Everyone should be cleaning up after themselves so there shouldn't be a mess for OP to clean.", "I'm the same way....I clean up after Myself.... I work 18- 20 hrs a day... I clean the bathroom as it's a shared space and I do that every Saturday\n... but I don't clean up after others...I will clean around the left over pots and pans and clean what I used... It's not petty it's standing up for yourself and the shared space you are Not obligated to clean after others but you are responsible for your own cleanliness.. I have 3 roommates and we all abide by these rules and it works out...", "People don\u2019t monitor what you use or don\u2019t use. The only roommates that I know use the kitchen are the ones making dinner every night. Someone could eat out every meal and I\u2019d be none the wiser.  I would notice if someone was skimping on their duties for a chore chart though as whatever needs to be clean, wouldn\u2019t be clean. \n\nHave a house meeting and explain how you don\u2019t use the kitchen and so don\u2019t think that should be part of your chores. In exchange, you can just clean the stuff you do use with more frequency. Ie, you\u2019d do the bathroom again when it\u2019d normally be your turn to clean the kitchen. Ask them if there\u2019s something you\u2019re not thinking of about it that they know of in regards to your use of the kitchen.", "I'm having a hard time believing it too. They never reheat their food? They never have to use any of the utensils? They never use the kitchen trash? Never ever?", "YTA, you live there, you clean. Clearly, everyone else is tired. Be a nice person and help out even if you don't have to. Don't be selfish. Shows you are only caring about yourself.", "Cleaning the kitchen and cleaning up other people\u2019s mess are two separate things. \n\n\nInfo: what do you mean by cleaning the kitchen? are you expected to wipe surfaces, mop floors, do dishes, etc?  Most of those tasks are general tasks that whoever uses the kitchen should do after they\u2019re done cooking. \n\n\nThere\u2019s some stuff that would make sense shared on a roster. Like cleaning the bins, wiping the kickboards, mopping the floor, cleaning the blinds, range hood and oven etc. \n\n\nIf it was me I\u2019d be happy to do the main ones but no way would I agree to wipe up someone else\u2019s slimy coffee or wash their dishes. \n\n\nAt the moment I\u2019d say NAH without more info. Sounds a bit like each of you have a different interpretation of cleaning the kitchen. NTA if your housemates expect you to do their dishes. YTA if you\u2019re leaving a mess for someone else.", "Do you use silverware? Do you walk on the floor? Put your stuff/food on the counters? Throw your trash in the kitchen garbage can? Get water from the sink? Yeah, you need to contribute. It's a communal kitchen that everyone uses in some capacity and you don't get to be the only one who isn't responsible for cleaning it. That's being a shitty roommate.", "sometimes cold chinese food is better left cold then warm but that's just on food i don't know about anyting else", "It's not exactly outside the realm of possibility. I work weird hours some weeks and don't use the kitchen at all during those weeks - I get takeout, take it directly to my room, eat it like a raccoon in the night, toss the boxes/wrapping paper into my trashcan that I take out myself. The only thing I go to the kitchen for is to get water from the fridge.", "I like to turn into a dirty night goblin that'll eat shredded cheese straight from the packaging, so I could only understand eating some foods cold. \n\nI'm just having a hard time believing someone living in a apartment/house and never ever using the kitchen for any need whatsoever. I'm not saying it's not possible, I'm just having a hard time believing it.", "I just can\u2019t imagine that you never have a bowl of cereal instead of takeout. Even ppl who constantly eat take out have snacks or ice cream around they use a bowl or spoon for.", "some food is just better cold and frigerated but the rest i would need to heat up so i get you\n\nyeah i agree with you on that, like never using anything in the kitchen? he could be but cleans it up after words so it counts as not \"using\"? but again we only have his side in all this plus the general advice of just be an adult and talk about it seems to be the best thing to do", "Ok but does OP keep a stash of disposable utensils in their room and walk the remnants to the trash outside directly every single meal? Instead of using the kitchen trash bin?", "Different strokes for different folks, I guess."]}
