If you throw it in the common house bin, then you have to take out trash at some point too.\n\nDo you use house cutlery? If so, then you should be immediately cleaning it at the minimum \n\n>I told him I would when I get the time and opportunity but he seems very annoyed.\n\nYou need to clarify to him (and to us for fair judgement) on how much kitchen you use and what would be fair responsibility for you. The basic understanding is equal division through rotation. If you are comfortable with that then you need to actively suggest other arrangements.", "NTA Tell your roommates to clean their own damn mess.", "NTA if you don\u2019t use it you shouldn\u2019t be obligated to clean it", "There's technically no division.

Not a spoon, not a pan. All the takeout boxes are taken out by me after I finish eating (in my room). Never used the oven, never used the microwave either. The 4 trash bags, not even a molecule in them belongs to me unfortunately.", "Nope. If they really do not use the kitchen then they really do not need to clean the kitchen", "This is bad advice because it's entirely based on assumptions.

It doesn't take that long if people just do it when it is their turn. If the other roommates also do it this way, it'll stay clean. Which is the goal. \n\nI'd argue that talking to them about it might help. Although I would be in favour of not making exceptions. Mostly because finger pointing and nitpicking means it is likely to not get done at all. Which is why this person's roommate is annoyed at them. \n\nBlaming people for the general mess is essentially impossible. A specific mess sure. The general mess is pretty much the fault of everyone that lives there. You live there? Then it is your responsibility when it is your turn to clean. Doesn't matter if it's 1% or 51% your fault.\n\nInstead of focusing on who is responsible based upon the general mess that is there.
