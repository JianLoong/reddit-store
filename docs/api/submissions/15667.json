By having access to the shared space, you share the responsibly of taking care of it.

They somewhat have to make you responsible for taking care of it because of the fact that you have access to it.\n\nThey can't effectively deny you access to exempt you from having to take care of it. Except by eviction. \n\nThen there is the whole perception of things compared to the reality of things. Along with who is going to do the bookkeeping required to make it not a trust based chore where everyone does exactly their fair share. Which is to much effort for the reward. \n\nFor the 10-20 minutes it takes to do the dishes. It is easier and simpler for everyone to just do it when it is their turn to do it.\n\nBeing right that everyone else combined makes more mess than you do as the individual is true no matter which individual says it. Which means the individualistic perspective makes sure it never gets done. Since everyone can say it's more the others fault than theirs alone. So \"they\" should do it instead. \n\nThe individualistic perspective makes it stay filthy. It is the group's space. It is a mess the group makes. To ensure that the mess is taken care of, it is entirely fair to assign people the responsibility of cleaning it. Their independent contribution to that mess is irrelevant.", "ESH\n\nIt is pretty basic for roommates to have a discussion the first day someone moves in - if not before that when discussing moving in - regarding how normal household chores are handled.\n\nIt is extremely typical for roommates to share cleaning chores of common areas - when I lived with roommates, we would rotate so that every week it was someone else's chore to clean a different common space. Of course we also weren't pigs so people did clean up after themselves in terms of dishes and wiping down counters but every week the kitchen would get mopped and other weekly cleaning like really cleaning stove top and sink.\n\nThe reason why you are treading on asshole territory is that you are stating you NEVER use the kitchen. That might be true but roommates hate policing someone else and so you are now in a position where if you even set foot in the kitchen to make a cup of tea or grab something out of the refrigerator you are going to be perceived as using the kitchen.", "Decide as a house what the chores/responsibilities are. It's not sustainable for everyone to just determine for themselves if they've made enough of a mess to have to participate in keeping it clean. If you literally never use the kitchen in any way then negotiate a chore system where you aren't responsible for helping clean the kitchen. If you sometimes use the kitchen then understand you're going to be responsible for helping keep things clean.", "NTA. But you need to have a roommate meeting and tell them if they push it, it will end up a battle to see who can mess up the kitchen the most when its the other persons week. It happened to me in a similar situation. At he peak of the fight I made spaghetti, got it everywhere and used every dish in the kitchen. \n\nIt was then that they remembered that before the fight that I was almost never there (at girlfriends 75% of the time), and once every two weeks or so I heated premade keto meals in the oven, washed my utensils and gave a wipe to the counter when I was done (unlike them, the slobs). I had my own personal small sheet pan I used to put the keto meal (think tv dinner). And that I rarely used the common space as I was usually at my GFs and the few times I was, I didnt hang in the common area.  They called truce and things went back to the way it was without all the whining. No one has the right to make you clean up after them without reciprocation.", "Lol I hated these types of roommates.
