I understand that would be difficult for him if that was to happen and most of the time I respect it and empathise with him. \n\nHowever, we had a function at work today and I had to bring a bunch of items that were difficult to get in and out of my car. I got there early and noticed the spot was vacant so I parked there so it would be easier to get the items back into my car later on in the day when the car park had filled up. \n\nHe was so angry. He left a note on my car, another on my desk and complained about me to multiple other staff. All of whom gave me dirty looks and treated me poorly during the day. He tried to bully me into moving my car for him. He even went to our boss, but the boss thankfully told him that I am not obligated to move. \n\nHe had a massive adult tantrum and refused to park in any other vacant spot and ended up parking a street away and having another colleague pick him up from his car and bring him to work and then back to his car in the afternoon. It was quite dramatic, especially considering it was only the next street, it wasn\u2019t far at all to walk. I could see his car from the entrance.

He isn\u2019t THAT big.\n\nThe way I was treated by him and his work friends was so bad that I am actually starting to wonder if I really am the a-hole.

Needing to park a street over allows him to get that much needed exercise to reduce his girth enough to fit his car into any space.

Now, some people when they raise issues/grievances at work find that they suffer for it. It's because the world is not a fair place.\n\nPersonally, I'd take this to HR. I'd register a grievance, and require a full apology from him, as well as him going to everybody who he had badmouthed me to and explaining how he was in the wrong to do so. I would be clear that I'd be happy to let the matter drop if they were prepared to be reasonable about it, but that his behavior was absolutely unacceptable and would not be tolerated if it continued.\n\nBut then, I'm a middle aged white guy. I expect things to be fairer than they actually are. Your experience may vary from mine.", "It sounds like you work at the kindergarten club.

No one owns that spot, and it should be first come, first serve.\n\nI\u2019d document the harassment and report to your HR.

He's creating a hostile work environment by complaining to everyone after the boss didn't make him move, especially by treating you differently and getting his friends to do so as well.", "I was thinking about talking to HR. My concern is making things worse for myself :/", "Yep, it was for a work function. You\u2019re right, I should go to HR. My fear is that it\u2019ll make the hate towards me worse", "You\u2019re right", "Same!", "Maybe I should. However, he would make my life a living hell. He seems to get away with so much.", "Mhm I'm petty enough that I'd be going to hr but parking there before I walk into their office, and every other day ever.\n Fk this guy what a brat.", "Haha true, thank you for your input", "They\u2019ve already accommodated him with a large chair and a desk that rises a little higher. He is also excluded from any physical aspect of the job. He never has to help set up events and gets to skip all of the staff meetings because the function room chairs are uncomfortable for him. He\u2019s very used to getting his way.", "No one has to put up with that type of treatment in work, he shouldn't be allowed to (pardon the pun) throw his weight around about something he has no entitlement to", "No, he needs to be reported asap. He's acting like an immature child and that is not to be tolerated in the workplace. You said you have no designated parking so he has absolutely no leg to stand on here. If he gets this upset over a parking spot just think of how over the top his reaction will be to something legitimately serious.", "At this point that's not worth worrying about. The guy is really immature and even if you apologized he doesn't sound like the type to let it go.", "Go to HR.

I\u2019m petty I\u2019d keep parking there at least once or twice a week. When he said something I\u2019d point out that the first time was because you had to unload a lot of items but that his tantrum took away any pity or respect you had so you park there when you feel like it now", "Are you feeling threatened by your co-workers?   If it's any kind of a middle or large size company, they wouldn't want the heat that comes with you like... the word getting out.    Your boss certainly doesn't want to explain their failure to take action, to their boss.   But workplace safety is a very big deal to corporate.  Do you feel safe?   You might be able to get rich the old fashioned way.", "Wow NTA- it isn't his designated parking spot that he was assigned or he pays for. He isnt actually disabled. He is just a whiny entitled grown man that made a parking spot everyone's problem. Ugh.", "NTA,\n\nAre there cameras in the parking lot? I\u2019d be worried he will key your car. Just a thought.", "I'm petty....I would park there daily.", "NTA, but naive of you to think he wouldn't get upset at you after you knew he basically claimed the spot as his.", "NTA. Either you have assigned parking or not. If you don't then his valid reason for wanting the spot does not mean other people cannot have valid reasons too.\n\nIt is one thing to ask people to leave it for him if possible but it is out of line to be rude if someone else needs it.", "One of my colleagues parks his truck crooked, right in the center of the lot leaving 1.5 spaces on either side. It's not as if there isn't room to turn in and park straight on, even for a giant pickup like his. You could fit 6 of them in the lot if they all parked proper. He's just totally inconsiderate, and it's not just the parking.", "Nta. Report to HR and if he continues his playground bullying, continue to report.", "NTA - Plain and simple, not his spot.  aNyone can park there.  He was being TAH for making a drama out of it.", "NTA. I would start getting earlier and taking it daily. Im petty.", "NTA. I'm carrying about 100 lbs extra compared to when I was young & skinny. I've had to do some squeezing on occasion to get into my car. I've had to actually climb across once or twice. Unless he weighs *considerably* more than I do, he can get in and out of his car in a normal space. \n\nIf he has real problems walking very far, he should talk to a doctor about getting a handicapped tag. Since he doesn't have one, I'm guessing he either doesn't qualify or has never asked. I'm also suspicious that it is the potential embarrassment of struggling to get in his car, not how far he might have to walk that he is mad about.", "Not that it should matter, but you parked in that spot for work reasons - you had a function.\n\nGo to HR.", "It's only going to get worse if you say nothing and cave in to his demands. Go to HR, it's their job to take care of his entitlement, not yours. He doesn't own the spot or company but he sure is acting like it. Turning coworkers against you turns it into a hostile work environment. \n\nNTA", "Oh my goodness, where is this place? I'm a teacher, an obese teacher, and guess who's there tying 1sr-grader's shoes, wiping the floor when they spill something, running, dodging balls, rope-jumping, egg-hiding, etc? \n\nYour workmate sounds very spoiled."]}
