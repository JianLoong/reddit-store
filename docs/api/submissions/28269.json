I understand that would be difficult for him if that was to happen and most of the time I respect it and empathise with him. \n\nHowever, we had a function at work today and I had to bring a bunch of items that were difficult to get in and out of my car. I got there early and noticed the spot was vacant so I parked there so it would be easier to get the items back into my car later on in the day when the car park had filled up. \n\nHe was so angry. He left a note on my car, another on my desk and complained about me to multiple other staff. All of whom gave me dirty looks and treated me poorly during the day. He tried to bully me into moving my car for him. He even went to our boss, but the boss thankfully told him that I am not obligated to move. \n\nHe had a massive adult tantrum and refused to park in any other vacant spot and ended up parking a street away and having another colleague pick him up from his car and bring him to work and then back to his car in the afternoon. It was quite dramatic, especially considering it was only the next street, it wasn\u2019t far at all to walk. I could see his car from the entrance.

He isn\u2019t THAT big.\n\nThe way I was treated by him and his work friends was so bad that I am actually starting to wonder if I really am the a-hole.

Needing to park a street over allows him to get that much needed exercise to reduce his girth enough to fit his car into any space.

Now, some people when they raise issues/grievances at work find that they suffer for it. It's because the world is not a fair place.\n\nPersonally, I'd take this to HR. I'd register a grievance, and require a full apology from him, as well as him going to everybody who he had badmouthed me to and explaining how he was in the wrong to do so. I would be clear that I'd be happy to let the matter drop if they were prepared to be reasonable about it, but that his behavior was absolutely unacceptable and would not be tolerated if it continued.\n\nBut then, I'm a middle aged white guy.
