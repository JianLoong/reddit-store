Your mom is 100% at fault for being okay with your step-dad calling you not family.  \n\nHe could have said- hey we were doing a trip for the youngins this time around. We have something planned for you this summer, and hey youd probably be fine.

Your mom is okay with out not being her daughter now...   \n\nHopefully yall can work it out. It is not about the vacation as much as the idea your mom now has about your place in her life.   \n\nGood luck with all of this.

They deserved to be yelled at, and I'm glad your Dad is there for you. \n\nTo address them calling you entitled (because I know it helps to see other people logic that stuff out for me) it wasn't. It might, arguably, have been slightly presumptive of you, but given they were talking about it around you and it seems like it's a relatively lowkey trip (as in, no one is leaving the country) it's reasonable to assume that they wanted you to come or would be fine with you attending, especially if you usually spend weekends with your mom. Even if you did make an incorrect assumption, that is NOT the same as being entitled, and a simple apology and explanation from them would have been enough to clear it up. You aren't reconsidering their place in your life because they're going on a vacation without you, you're doing so because your stepfather acted like a complete jackass and told you he didn't consider you family to your face. THAT is why they got yelled at. And there's nothing entitled about being hurt by that, especially if your mom didn't correct him. That's just being a reasonable human being.\n\nGoing low or no contact is a big decision, but it's one you should consider. Even if you decide not to, it may be worth emotionally distancing yourself from them since it's been made clear acting like/assuming you're considered part of 'their family' may get you hurt.

She used to housesit for her father while he went on his \"family vacations\". It hurt her deeply back then to be never invited or included (but feed the cats and bring in the mail for them!)

Because \"mom\" is a title for family. \n\nI would ask your mom for a family therapy session over this. She needs to know and have a therapist help her understand how very very deeply she's hurt you and how bad this emotional wound is.

I am a better place now that I ever have been, thanks to therapy etc. But I definitely think you should move towards mainly spending your energy on your dad.

So they are no longer family just people you are related to and your therapist and dad can help you navigate going low/no contact. Hopefully your mom wakes up but if not Im glad you have your dad he sounds the best.", "You're old enough to not visit your mom anymore if your dad is good with you being at his full time.", "NTA and the fact that your mom didn't protest is really messed up. You're not a brat for wanting to go on a *family vacation* and I hope your mom knows that you think she doesn't think of you as family.", "NTA and I hope you are able to stay with your dad full time. Your stepdad is awful but your mother is worse. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.", "Let me preface here by saying that I am not a lawyer, just a dad.  One that is pretty sore by proxy, as it were.\n\nFirst thing: I am really sorry to hear you\u2019re going through that.  NO child should ever hear that from their parents, bio or otherwise.  By the same token, you\u2019re *definitely* NTA.  Both stepdad and mom are the AH here.  And good for your dad to step in.  The rest of this is dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s.  And some final comments.\n\nHappy to hear you\u2019re in therapy, please continue and broach the subject with the therapist.  Including all comments, what was said, who was there (especially if anything was in front of your half-siblings), etc.  Be open, and honest.  If possible, write it down, in detail.  Writing things out can be cathartic; that\u2019s the very foundation of keeping diaries.  Plus it helps memory when needed.\n\nNext bit, more the practicalities.  Would you be able to stay at your Dad\u2019s full-time?  Not from a legal perspective - more to that shortly - but just from the physical perspective of you being there 100% of the time.  My guess, probably, since you already live there most of the time.  But you\u2019ll need to check, even if just to confirm.\n\nBit after that - now the legal side - can your dad get 100% custody?  Because if there ever was an alienation of affection statement, indicating clear *lack* of affection, you just got it, 1000%.  From your step-dad, and by her support, from your mom.  Even more so, with their reaction and statements to *you* after your dad went to bat for you.  This unfortunately may need to be dragged in front of a judge, especially if there are any support payments involved from your dad to your mom (or vice versa).  As much as it hurts - the couple clearly wants to be with their kids only, and see you as a burden & worse.  Sick, I know, and again, I am really sorry you\u2019re dealing with it.  It shouldn\u2019t be that way, but they expressed their true feelings clearly.  At age 16, in most cases, judges will want to hear from you what you want.  You\u2019re close to adulthood now - 2 years isn\u2019t really that long a time - and you deserve to have your wishes respected in that.  You\u2019ll need to be clear on what those are, though, the clearer and more precise, the better.\n\nIf the above can be done - custody transfer 100% to your dad, etc. - then I personally would go NC with them.  LC at best - like maybe once a year type LC.  Like graduation is 100% dad; no invitations to them.  And so on.\n\nThey\u2019ve chosen to exit from your life by their attitude.  *You* can grant them that wish, and set things up in a way that pointedly tells them not to let the doorknob hit them on the way out.  Imho, they deserve that, at least.\n\nOutside of you, the ones I feel bad for are your half-siblings.  They still get to endure their parents for a decade or more, and on top of that, lose contact with an older sister.  Plus have to listen to whatever fantasies they will tell them about you and your dad.  Hopefully, that can be fixed some day.\n\nIn all of this, none of this is your fault.  None of it.  Please keep that in mind.\n\nAnd, if you don\u2019t mind, a hug from an internet stranger who\u2019d buy your Dad a beer for how he stood up for his daughter.  Good man, there.", "Screw them. I also lived with my father over my mother. Crap like this strained our relationship and she missed out on being in my life because of it. She has regrets, I do not.", "NTA.  Oh sweetie my heart breaks for you.  You have done nothing wrong.  Your Mom has massively failed you.  Please do what\u2019s best for you to protect yourself,  your Mother is not.  If that means you take a break from them for awhile to heal yourself, then do it.  I\u2019m so sorry your Mom and Stepfather have been so cruel to you.

Your dad acted appropriately.", "NTA. Your mom and step-dad are terrible, and one day your mother will realize the impact this has had on you and beg for an apology. You now know where you stand. It's a painful realization. I'm so so sorry.", "NTA!\n\nPlease, please look into having your Dad get full custody.  A judge would be outraged at this, and I believe you should be old enough to have a say now (it's your Dad's custody attorney who would know that).\n\nThis is really unforgiveable.  If you marry someone with a child, that means it's a package deal.  You don't make your spouse give them up because you only want your own children around.  He's actually a monster.  Your Mom's no better, because she's so desperate to keep him that she's throwing you to the wolves.\n\nThey should not have become a couple.  He should have broken up with her the minute he found out she had you, because he clearly wants her all to himself.  It doesn't work that way when you get involved with someone who has a pre-existing child.", "NTA at all, dude. As if your mom icing you out to align with step dad's shittiness isn't bad enough, being mad at you that your father called them out is peak AH for not recognizing their part in this situation caused entirely by their exclusion and callousness. \n\nYou're better off distancing yourself from them now, shitty people tend to get shittier with time.", "NTA - Can you stay with your Dad full time? I think you should take a break from them. Let them have their family. You and your dad seem to have a good thing going. Id just stop going over there all together.", "If you become successful and have lots of money, suddenly, your family and need to give them money, because it's Family!", "NTA.

Like hello dude you joined MY family. New kids or not all of my children are my family. Go very low contact if any at all.

As a mother I cannot see why anyone would just ope I have a new family guess the oldest child can be kicked to the curb. That's fkd up.
