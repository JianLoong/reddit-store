Frankly, you\u2019re old enough to choose who you live with. Choose the people in life who choose you. Ask your dad if you can see a therapist to work through these issues. I\u2019d go low or no contact with your mom for now until you are ready and/or able to be around them. That may not be for a long time. And that\u2019s ok. Hopefully therapy and your dad will help you to find a way to heal.", "This is so terrible and hurtful and I am very sorry.\n\nSo now that you know your step dad feels this week, you are likely old enough to do something with that info.\n\nIf it were me, as a petty 16 year old, would say that you don't want to go back there.  And make sure mom and step dad know it's because you aren't family.   Is this nice? No.  But it is what I would have done.\n\nWould your dad be ok with you spending less them there? Do you want to spend less time there?\n\nPeople can be really cruel.  And I am so sorry you are just now learning this.", "NTA \n\nTAs are your stepdad and mom. Unfortunately, even if they relented in having you go with them on vacation, they would have still alienated you. They suck for hanging a carrot in front of you like that. Good thing you have your dad who\u2019s in your corner.", "NTA. Shame on your mom and stepdad. The way you\u2019re feeling about this situation is totally natural; of course you\u2019re hurt. Good for your dad for saying something to them.", "NTA 1000%   \n\nYour MOM allowed your step-dad to say \"you are not our family\" in front of you. This is a huge deal. Like a - I will go to counseling for a dozen years but when I am 60 years old, I will still be hurt by it- big deal.  \n\nI am older and have kids around your age. I remember shit my parents said to me at 16 that still hurts. It may have been in jest or a misunderstanding. But it felt like honesty.  \n\nGood on your dad for standing up for you. If you mom and \"step-dad\" call you an entitled brat- ask them how it would feel if the roles were reversed? Try not to attack back- just ask them - well how would you feel?  \n\nSounds like your pops is a good dude- might be time to decide to spend more time with him.  \n\nI am sorry your mom is the AH in this situation. Yeah, your step-dad sounds like an AH too - but it is 100% your mom in this situation who needs to step-up and provide the right home for you.  \n\nIf I was re-married and my new spouse said my kid was not part of the family- the marriage would be over. My kids above all else.  \n\nYeah- your mom (and dad) are trying to navigate this new world and your mom is trying to keep her marriage positive. But she stepped over a line that is really hard to come back from.  \n\nWhat happens when you go to college? do you no longer have a home with you \"family\"? what if you get married one day or even have kids? Is your mom a grandma now but you weren't family then?  \n\nHer choices have the potential to have very long lasting issues. I would (if you are brave enough- as it aint easy) get your mom alone somewhere and let her know what she is saying to you, how it could have long term consequences, and what you need from her. If she calls you an entitled teenager brat- then go move in with your dad.  \n\nYou are old enough that custody rules and all that start to be up to you - not up to your parents.  \n\nSorry this is happening. There are a BUNCH of adults here that will tell you how much your mom has F'ed up here. Like legit- 1000% horrible- bad- can't believe it. I would go yell at your mom if I could.", "NTA - your stepdad needs a good kick in the rear!!! And your mom is even worse than him if she didn't invite you and stand up for you when he said that. If I were you, I would totally cut off my mom. I absolutely would quit speaking to her because this is totally unacceptable for a mother to do. And I speak from understanding as my parents were divorced as well and my mom was a piece of work in her own way. I didn't speak to her for a few years at one point.", "NTA. Your mother agrees with him. I'm so sorry. So very sorry.", "NTA  \nYour mother is being horrible. You're her child, no matter what man she's with.

NTA. You answered a question - what happened next is not something you could control.", "NTA, that\u2019s extremely hurtful to hear", "NTA. \n\nYour mom and stepdad need to take a long walk off a short pier at this point. What kind of parent allows ANYONE to tell their child they aren\u2019t part of the family?!?!?\nI truly hope you don\u2019t go back to see them. Let your mom feel the pain of not having you around. And if she doesn\u2019t feel pain or reach out, you\u2019ll know where you stand with her.", "NTA.  I am sorry that your mom and stepdad are utterly complete AH's.  I am a step-father and would never treat my step-daughter this way.  My stepdaughter is my daughter and there is no other way to look at it.  I am sorry that your stepdad is a monster and doesn't also believe this.  You are old enough to choose to stay with your dad.  Talk with your dad so he can do the proper paperwork and process.  If your mom says anything about it then you can always say \"But Mom (or Stepdad), I am not family\".    \n\n\nIt would have been fine if your mom and stepdad talked with you and explained that they want to take the little kids.   But the way they did it was evil, cruel, and inhumane.", "NTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut next time they ask for anything help, or anything that can be seen as some family activity, just remind the that \"*I'm not family, remember.*\".   \nAsk your dad to live with him all the time, and make sure to hurt your mom and stepdad where it hurts, wallet and pride. \n\nAnd next time you visit mom, get your stuff out, all of it. Mugs, paintings and so on, all of it.", "NTA\n\nWhat an awful thing to say, and while your stepdad is obviously an AH, your mother is also a massive AH for not sticking up for you. Your father was completely correct in being pissed off. There's a million ways they could've figured out how to exclude you from the trip without saying you aren't family. Your mother and stepdad are massive masssive AHs.", "NTA.\n\n> they should be allowed to go on vacation with just them and their kids\n\nThis says it ALL.\n\nThey don't consider you to be one of them.\n\nYour obviously not the asshole, but you do have to decide what to do next. It is very possible for you to go NC or LC as you are 16 and if you ask them to, judges will likely side with your father and grant him full custody of you. <<< I'm pretty sure that's how it works, that once your 15 you get a say, but I'm no lawyer so your going to have to take a look into that.", "NTA. That was incredibly insensitive of them.", "NTA. Your mom and step-dad ain't sh*t for that crap. Don't deal with them if they want to exclude you like that, but got the nerve to discuss it in front of you like you can't hear. Smh I'm sorry girl.", "NTA", "NTA. I'm so sorry they are butt heads.", "NTA that is horrible. That was a cruel thing to say. \n\nHalf-siblings are still siblings and you have been told that you aren't their sister. Your mother is the worst here for not sticking up for you and your stepdad is really just your mum's husband now.", "NTA and that is HORRIBLE. And big props to your Dad for reading them the riot act. I would not set foot in your mother's house again in this lifetime. So sorry.", "NTA your mom is awful here because you are her biological child and in every way her family in the highest way possible. This is cruel, regardless of if you would even want to go or not.\n\nI would make a point not to return to them. Stay only with your dad.

Your dad could tell you were upset and asked why. You gave an honest answer. Your mother and stepfather told you that you weren't their family.

Each relationship is unique and understanding that if you're not forced to be around them than don't be. \n\nBut I encourage you to be honest, even if it makes you upset, to your mother on why you're living with dad full time IF she asks.

I'm hurt I'm not a part of *your* family.\"", "Your mum is definitely the biggest asshole for allowing him to say that", "Yeah - in these situations, it is easy to shift blame off the person who is actually at fault. Your mom is 100% at fault for being okay with your step-dad calling you not family.  \n\nHe could have said- hey we were doing a trip for the youngins this time around. We have something planned for you this summer, and hey youd probably be fine. BUT instead he said \"you are not family\" and your mom did not intervene and even got mad at you.  \n\nMad at your for being upset by being called \"not family\". Your mom is okay with you being called not her daughter.   \n\nThat is some dark stuff - nobody your age (or any age) should hear that kind of thing.   \n\nYour step-dad may believe it 100% - but who cares - he is just mom's new hubby. Your mom is okay with out not being her daughter now...   \n\nHopefully yall can work it out. It is not about the vacation as much as the idea your mom now has about your place in her life.   \n\nGood luck with all of this. It is hard to have to grow up a little early but it sounds like that is whats happening to you. Try to breathe through the angry moments and react with questions versus anger to your mom and step-dad.  \n\nAnd hopefully your counselor is a good one. If you don't like your therapist- you are allowed to switch! it can take 2-3 to find one you really like (just in case no one ever told you that).  \n\nSounds like you got a good dad. All parents suck sometimes- we try out best (even the good one) and still screw it up. This is not just a simple - hey that's not nice. This is a - fork in the road moment for your relationship with your mom.", "I am sorry this happened to you.  The commenters have good advice.  It was not your fault.  Your mother and step-father violated a basic social norm.  DO NOT TALK ABOUT A PARTY OR TRIP IN FRONT OF SOMEONE NOT INVITED.  This is very bad form.  They set you up.", "If you do have to talk to her, stop calling her mom. If you're not family, she clearly doesn't deserve the title. Neither do the children you used to hang out with while at her house. Not your siblings, i know most people hang on hard to protecting the innocent children, but explain to them that their mommy and daddy said you can't be part of the family anymore/dont love you. Let them deal with the fallout."]}
