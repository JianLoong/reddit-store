Your mom is 100% at fault for being okay with your step-dad calling you not family.  \n\nHe could have said- hey we were doing a trip for the youngins this time around. We have something planned for you this summer, and hey youd probably be fine.

Your mom is okay with you being called not her daughter.   \n\nThat is some dark stuff - nobody your age (or any age) should hear that kind of thing.   \n\nYour step-dad may believe it 100% - but who cares - he is just mom's new hubby. Your mom is okay with out not being her daughter now...   \n\nHopefully yall can work it out. It is not about the vacation as much as the idea your mom now has about your place in her life.   \n\nGood luck with all of this. It is hard to have to grow up a little early but it sounds like that is whats happening to you. Try to breathe through the angry moments and react with questions versus anger to your mom and step-dad.  \n\nAnd hopefully your counselor is a good one.

They deserved to be yelled at, and I'm glad your Dad is there for you. \n\nTo address them calling you entitled (because I know it helps to see other people logic that stuff out for me) it wasn't. It might, arguably, have been slightly presumptive of you, but given they were talking about it around you and it seems like it's a relatively lowkey trip (as in, no one is leaving the country) it's reasonable to assume that they wanted you to come or would be fine with you attending, especially if you usually spend weekends with your mom. Even if you did make an incorrect assumption, that is NOT the same as being entitled, and a simple apology and explanation from them would have been enough to clear it up. You aren't reconsidering their place in your life because they're going on a vacation without you, you're doing so because your stepfather acted like a complete jackass and told you he didn't consider you family to your face. THAT is why they got yelled at. And there's nothing entitled about being hurt by that, especially if your mom didn't correct him. That's just being a reasonable human being.\n\nGoing low or no contact is a big decision, but it's one you should consider. Even if you decide not to, it may be worth emotionally distancing yourself from them since it's been made clear acting like/assuming you're considered part of 'their family' may get you hurt.

She used to housesit for her father while he went on his \"family vacations\". It hurt her deeply back then to be never invited or included (but feed the cats and bring in the mail for them!) Her mom never stood up for her and she just quietly took the hurt- so I'm glad you have your dad in your corner to stand behind you and affirm how messed up it is to be told so clearly that you're not within her bounds of \"family.\"\n\n\nI'm petty AF, so if it were me, I'd stop calling my mom Mom and refer to her as Mrs Lastname. Because \"mom\" is a title for family. \n\nI would ask your mom for a family therapy session over this.

One that is pretty sore by proxy, as it were.\n\nFirst thing: I am really sorry to hear you\u2019re going through that.  NO child should ever hear that from their parents, bio or otherwise.  By the same token, you\u2019re *definitely* NTA.  Both stepdad and mom are the AH here.  And good for your dad to step in.  The rest of this is dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s.  And some final comments.\n\nHappy to hear you\u2019re in therapy, please continue and broach the subject with the therapist.  Including all comments, what was said, who was there (especially if anything was in front of your half-siblings), etc.  Be open, and honest.  If possible, write it down, in detail.  Writing things out can be cathartic; that\u2019s the very foundation of keeping diaries.  Plus it helps memory when needed.\n\nNext bit, more the practicalities.  Would you be able to stay at your Dad\u2019s full-time?  Not from a legal perspective - more to that shortly - but just from the physical perspective of you being there 100% of the time.  My guess, probably, since you already live there most of the time.  But you\u2019ll need to check, even if just to confirm.\n\nBit after that - now the legal side - can your dad get 100% custody?  Because if there ever was an alienation of affection statement, indicating clear *lack* of affection, you just got it, 1000%.  From your step-dad, and by her support, from your mom.  Even more so, with their reaction and statements to *you* after your dad went to bat for you.  This unfortunately may need to be dragged in front of a judge, especially if there are any support payments involved from your dad to your mom (or vice versa).  As much as it hurts - the couple clearly wants to be with their kids only, and see you as a burden & worse.  Sick, I know, and again, I am really sorry you\u2019re dealing with it.  It shouldn\u2019t be that way, but they expressed their true feelings clearly.  At age 16, in most cases, judges will want to hear from you what you want.  You\u2019re close to adulthood now - 2 years isn\u2019t really that long a time - and you deserve to have your wishes respected in that.  You\u2019ll need to be clear on what those are, though, the clearer and more precise, the better.\n\nIf the above can be done - custody transfer 100% to your dad, etc. - then I personally would go NC with them.  LC at best - like maybe once a year type LC.  Like graduation is 100% dad; no invitations to them.  And so on.\n\nThey\u2019ve chosen to exit from your life by their attitude.  *You* can grant them that wish, and set things up in a way that pointedly tells them not to let the doorknob hit them on the way out.  Imho, they deserve that, at least.\n\nOutside of you, the ones I feel bad for are your half-siblings.  They still get to endure their parents for a decade or more, and on top of that, lose contact with an older sister.  Plus have to listen to whatever fantasies they will tell them about you and your dad.  Hopefully, that can be fixed some day.\n\nIn all of this, none of this is your fault.  None of it.  Please keep that in mind.\n\nAnd, if you don\u2019t mind, a hug from an internet stranger who\u2019d buy your Dad a beer for how he stood up for his daughter.  Good man, there.", "Screw them.

She had to do all the cooking and cleaning and watch her little brothers ALL the time.  Nobody else remembers this.

You did the right thing talking to your dad. If one parent won\u2019t listen, then of course you\u2019re gonna go to the other parent that\u2019s what parents are for. Just because your parents got divorced and created new families doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t family. In fact they should be doing everything in their power to make you feel like family, because you are. They are so far into the wrong and you are wise to know the difference, and to know that you deserve better. I would let your dad be your advocate, and if they don\u2019t wise up, take care of yourself and focus on your needs. Maybe find a counselor who can help you  find your voice and be a support- maybe they can also help by talking to your mom about her responsibility to support you and help from making it just between your dad and her (which will likely be a bunch of conflict making it worse).

That is messed up and sincerely sorry they are treating you that way.

Since they don't think of you as family you may want to reconsider spending any time there in the future, for your own well being.  I'm so sorry they think it's okay to treat you this way.  Children should be cherished.  Unfortunately some parents when they remarry put their new spouses over their children from a previous marriage/relationship.

Shopping, cooking, cleaning, everything. Finally, he did actually realise he hadn't even done a fraction of it before that week, and all was well in the world, until the next teen-tantrum. \n\nIt's surprising what kids internalise. You might've made her do the dishes once a week on a rota basis, and she didn't 'see' the other nights where siblings and parents do those dishes.
