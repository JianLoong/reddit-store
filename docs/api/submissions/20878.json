For starters, air is 78% nitrogen, so if \"nitrogen\" were toxic to fish they'd be dead. \n\nThe process of setting up a brand new fish tank includes what's called \"cycling\"; do that wrong and you can end up with dead fish. It's a basic application of the nitrogen cycle. Fish urine is high in ammonia, and if you just throw them in a tank ammonia builds up, which can be toxic. Over a few weeks, bacteria which convert ammonia to nitrites build up in the tank, so the concentration of ammonia falls and nitrites build up. Unfortunately high nitrite concentrations are also harmful for fish, so you need to wait until the populations of bacteria that convert nitrites to nitrates build up. Once that's done, you've got a system in place that converts harmful ammonia to harmless nitrates relatively quickly.\n\nMelamine itself isn't toxic (melamine plastics are considered safe) but if you ingest it, it can end up being deposited in your kidneys, causing kidney failure. I have no idea if this is true for fish; unlike mammalians kidneys (which work to conserve water and get rid of nitrogenous waste) the main function in freshwater fish is to get rid of excess water.

The nitrogen cycle is one of the first thing fish keepers learn.  A new aquarium will initially experience a build up of ammonia (NH3).  Ammonia is ridiculously toxic to fish.  Experience keepers won't add fish to a tank at this stage as it is incredibly streasful for the animal and will likely lead to death without constant water changes.  The tank then develops bacteria that break ammonia down into Nitrites (NO2).  Nitrites are also very toxic to fish.  The tank is still not ready for animals.  The tank then develops bacteria that break the nitrites down to nitrates (NO3).  Nitrates are much less toxic to fish unless they are present in high concentrations.  Fish keepers test tank water regularly to make sure the water stays at 0ppm ammonia, 0ppm nitrites, and ideally keeping Nitrates  below 20ppm for a salt water tank. (Planted freshwater tanks can handle higher concentrations of nitrates as the plants use it.) The bacteria used in the cycle is sensitive.  If the bacteria is killed off the cycle crashes and levels become toxic very quickly.
