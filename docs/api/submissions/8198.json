But in all likelihood, the practicality of getting a schedule change for a student whose IEP specifies the need for a consistent schedule is going to be really hard. So as awful as it is for you, you are probably going to have to decide whether you want to deal with this student in your class, or change classes. \n\nOne other option: your school/district should have a position called something like \"nondiscrimination coordinator\" or \"complaint coordinator\" or something like that you can look up on the website (or call the office and ask for the contact info).

Like others have said, schools react more to parents than students. \n\n2) I saw that your guidance counselor is on maternity leave. Go to the guidance office and ask who is replacing so and so. Their should be a substitute guidance counselor. If not, go to any guidance counselor. A teacher might also be able to direct you. \n\n3) Is your art teacher aware? \n\n4) A couple of years ago I worked with students on the spectrum. Some (not all) have issues with boundaries and social cues. So, this person might not understand that you\u2019re trying to ignore them. Alternatively, you might need to be more direct so they understand. For example, when I worked with students, if they said an inappropriate comment, I would have to address it. \n\nPeople on the spectrum might also have special interests where they like to fixate on a certain topic. This is not limited to people and crushes. If he\u2019s your crush he might not understand relationship/social cues and it might come across as stalking. \n\n5) Yes, people on the spectrum have difficulties with adjusting schedules. What might be a slight inconvenience is detrimental to those on the spectrum. Changing his schedule involved IEP (individual education plan)  law, discrimination, special education requirements, that the school is trying to accomplish. \n\n6) However, in your case Title IX still applies and is another law that the school is required to abide by. Title IX is a law that protects students from gender discrimination, harassment, and having a safe environment to learn in. \n\nThus, it would be unfair for you to change your schedule, but I can see why the school is being uptight. \n\nThis is not an AITA situation, but something that requires intervention from your school.", "Fuck that.

That being said, this is directly from the US Dept. of Ed. \n\n \u201cTo what extent is it permissible under IDEA for school districts to consider the impact of a regular classroom placement on those students in the classroom who do not have a disability?\n\nANSWER: IDEA regulations provide that in selecting the LRE, consideration is given to any potential harmful effect on the student or on the quality of services that the student needs.\n\nIf a student with a disability has behavioral problems that are so disruptive in a regular classroom that the education of other students is significantly impaired, the needs of the disabled student cannot be met in that environment.\n\nHowever, before making such a determination, school districts must ensure that consideration has been given to the full range of supplementary aids and services that could be provided to the student in the regular educational environment to accommodate the unique needs of the disabled student. If the placement team determines that even with the provision of supplementary aids and services, that student's IEP could not be implemented satisfactorily in the regular educational environment, that placement would not be the LRE placement for that student at the particular time, because her or his unique educational needs could not be met in that setting.\n\nWhile IDEA regulations permit consideration of the effect of the placement of a disabled student in a regular classroom on other students in that classroom, selected findings from Federally funded research projects indicate that: \n\n(1) achievement test performance among students who were classmates of students with significant disabilities were equivalent or better than a comparison group (Salisbury, 1993); \n\n(2) students developed more positive attitudes towards peers with disabilities (CRI, 1992); and \n\n(3) self concept, social skills, and problem solving skills improved for all students in inclusive settings (Peck, Donaldson, & Pezzoli, 1990, Salisbury & Palombaro, 1993). 1\u201d\n\nSo based on this the school needs to either provide more support (maybe the guidance and services of a behavior specialist) or reconsider the student\u2019s LRE (least restrictive environment). \n\nI would also file a Title IX claim IN WRITING to both your dean and your district\u2019s Title IX coordinator. \n\nHappy to go into more detail but you can honestly just show your dean this and they should get it. :-)", "NTA that is assault", "NTA the school is. Happens all the time and it\u2019s always the person that get harassed getting punished, we need to just accept that they are disabled and put up with it and it\u2019s so unfair.", "NTA, but I echo the comments saying that this other student likely has an IEP in place, and so changing his schedule isn\u2019t as easy (for the school) as it would be to change yours, which is likely why the Dean is hoping you\u2019ll just acquiesce to being moved.  But as you\u2019ve rightly pointed out, you aren\u2019t the problem here, so why should you have to be the one to move?\n\nSo, for you, it comes down to this: how far are you willing to go to fight this? At what point is \u201cthe juice not worth the squeeze\u201d (as we say in my industry) for you? It may be that you don\u2019t have a point - that you\u2019re happy to fight this as long as you need to. If that\u2019s the case, great! Go for it!

And I would go over the dean\u2019s head though and talk to the school board if needed. They can assemble the IEP team and possibly get this kid a new aide while their at it.", "I am both autistic and a former school employee:\n\nIf at all possible, Op's parents need to be involved in this; schools are always 10000% more receptive when angry parents are the ones doing the complaining. Sucks, but it's true.\n\nWhether or not Op's parents get involved, Op needs to make sure shit's communicated to the school *in writing*, either via email with read receipts turned on or through a tracked letter sent that requires someone sign for it so no one can lie and say they weren't properly informed.\n\nThis written complaint needs to be as detailed as possible regarding specifics of the classmate's conduct, frequency, who has witnessed the behavior, what if anything any adults employed by the school have done to stop the behavior, how the behavior is affecting her ability to participate in class, how it affects her outside of class.\n\nIt would also be helpful to have Op's friends also write signed and dated letters (might even want to get them notarized tbh; where I live it was about $20 last time I used a notary but mine was just \"this is indeed Sharky's signature on official document\" so ymmv) regarding the classmate's conduct, also including specifics as to what inappropriate behaviors, touching, and comments are occurring, with a priority of what they as individuals have *personally witnessed*, not just stuff you've told them about. If there's a few nice classmates who aren't really friends but have also witnessed his behaviors and are willing to help, ask them to also write letters on your behalf.\n\nThe communication does need to be specific that sexual harassment is occurring, the frequency (with times and dates whenever you can) and how adults' responses have been lacking in terms of getting that asshole to back the fuck off and leave them alone. When possible, direct quotes of the dean's responses are helpful.\n\nHere's the thing; autistic folks aren't stupid. Like, we might not instinctively get that thing we just said was inappropriate, but if someone sits us down and lays shit out in detail \"you said xyz; xyz is inappropriate to say because Reason 1, Reason 2, Reason 3, which then results in people feeling uncomfortable and sexually harassed *regardless of whether you meant it that way or not* so knock it the fuck off\" we are not just capable of understanding that but are fully capable of feeling shitty that we made you feel that way and changing our behavior. If anything, more detail about how and why something is inappropriate is better than \"stop, that's inappropriate\" because if no one is telling you *how and why* we're gonna have difficulty changing our script on How to Properly Human.\n\nOp also needs to get loud every single time inappropriate behaviors occur. \"DO NOT TOUCH MY BODY! Why are you touching my body?! I have told you over and over NOT TO TOUCH MY BODY, why are you CONTINUING TO TOUCH ME?!\" \"What you just said is GROSS and CREEPY and INAPPROPRIATE, DO NOT TALK TO ME AGAIN! We ARE NOT friends DON'T talk to me again!\" And so forth. And I do mean get loud *every single time* it happens. You *want* everyone in the room to hear you express what perfectly normal boundaries are being transgressed upon every single time it happens, and that you are telling classmate outright to stop it.\n\nPersonally, I'd send these very detailed letters to the dean, the school board, and if possible (might wanna check with a lawyer first) the guy's parents.

His parents not only threatened to sue but asked us to tell them if 15F was out for the day so they could bring their son in, which morally we wouldn't do and legally we couldn't.
