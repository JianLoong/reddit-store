I said I was sorry but working for her just wasn\u2019t for me.

I said I was a sorry and we haven\u2019t spoken since until yesterday.\n\nMy opportunity did not pan out and I\u2019m about to be evicted and homeless.

And even gifted the previous sum that was supposed to be a loan.\n\nAccording to this, you've been unemployed for, what, almost 3 years.

I\u2019m sure they no longer consider you family anymore with that sort of behavior. You definitely need to grow up. Scam after scam? How old are you to not know how to think???

Even if you couldn\u2019t pay it back all it once, you should\u2019ve been out there looking for work so you could at least make nominal payments to them until you were fully back on your feet. Frankly, it\u2019s really appalling to me that you describe the money as a \u201cloan\u201d (something that\u2019s required to be paid back) but you see no problem with treating it like a gift (something that\u2019s not required to be paid back). The fact that your sister and BIL chose to forgive the loan was a decision made out of extreme kindness, not because you were entitled to a cent of their money. And to be clear, you didn\u2019t ask for a second \u201cloan\u201d because, let\u2019s be real, you knew you\u2019d never pay that back either. Your sister and BIL knew that, too. They knew that giving you money would be like burning it in a trash pit. \n\nAfter reading what your \u201cother option\u201d was, I really want to believe you\u2019re a troll. If you\u2019re not a troll, then you are immature, you do need to grow up, and you should be ashamed of your behavior. In fact, have you ever heard the phrase \u201cbeggars can\u2019t be choosers\u201d? I suggest that you repeat that phrase to yourself over and over again until it sinks in.  Working for your sister\u2019s not for you? Interesting. Is ending up unemployed and on the streets more your style? Because that\u2019s where you\u2019re at because of your own terrible decisions and poor work ethic.

I lost my job, I got busted for \u201ccheating\u201d the Covid unemployment, my girlfriend left me, I got Covid doing temp work from a guy who refused to wear a mask and came so close to dying. after that I could not work. \n\nMy younger sisters husband works for a company that was incredibly successful over the last couple years  and she was able loan me a significant sum of money to keep me afloat after had unjustly pay back our state unemployment system. Unfortunately I could\nNot afford to pay her back. She said that for the sake of family she was going to let the debt go.\n\nIn December I was still unemployed so she offered me a job working for her photography studio. I had something else lined up at the time so I said no thank you. She said the job wasn\u2019t even the a \u201cjob\u201d and it was time for me to grow up. I said I was sorry but working for her just wasn\u2019t for me. She said she needed the help and thought it was really shitty of me to accept her money, not pay it back and then refuse a well paying job. I said I was a sorry and we haven\u2019t spoken since until yesterday.\n\nMy opportunity did not pan out and I\u2019m about to be evicted and homeless. I went to my sisters house to ask her for another loan and she absolutely lost her shit with me. Her husband essentially threw me out with no discussion.\n\nMy mom called me and I talked with her for a while and she asked where I got the nerve. I explained that we are family and it can\u2019t hurt to ask. She said and I quote: \u201cever since you were in high school we loved you but thought you were an asshole, now we just\nThink you are an asshole.\u201d\n\nYes I\u2019m not perfect but I live in a horrible system and do what I have to survive.
