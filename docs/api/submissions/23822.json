I agreed and went off cleaning the guest bed room for him. My husband brother is 27 years old he didn\u2019t want to attend college like his older sister and brother instead he worked at a small IT company nearby. The guest bedroom was upstairs near my kids rooms and ours was downstairs.  I wake up in the night and just hear machine and gun noises coming from upstairs. I thought my son was playing his game upstairs so I sleepily walked up there to only see him asleep instead it was my BIL. I asked him if he could turn down the volume so we could sleep he quietly agreed and apologized for the noise. Nothing happened and I went to bed. \n\n\n\n\nThe next day he introduces a woman to us. He\u2019s says this is his girlfriend and that they have been dating for 2 months now they also brought over some drinks which I didn\u2019t  like in front of the kids so I asked if we could drink a little later tonight. He agreed but his girlfriend was already drinking out of a plastic cup I told my kids to head upstairs and just started cooking dinner. \n\n\nHours go by and my husband comes home from work and we start setting the dinner table. After dinner my BIL asks if his girlfriend spends the night because it\u2019s too late to get an Uber at this time. I ask my BIL if she had any friends that could pick her up but he says they were out of town. I simply agree at this point and hope nothing bad happens.\n\n\n\nI wake up to my son telling me that his uncle\u2019s girlfriend is yelling and he can\u2019t sleep i immediately rush up stairs only to hear them loudly intimate with one another. I knocked on the door and whispered please not so loudly they continued for another 10 minutes and went quiet after. The next morning I tell my BIL to pack his stuff and leave he called an Uber and left my husband comes from work and starts yelling on how his brother made one mistake and I kicked him out. I said I wasn\u2019t ready to deal with that for an entire month. AITA\n\nEdit: he\u2019s back in my house\u2026. I\u2019ve asked my husband to set rules with him but he\u2019s saying that\u2019s embarrassing for him since he\u2019s a grown man\u2026 this is frustrating because he\u2019s literally drinking again my kids are thankfully asleep but he\u2019s already drunk.

Kids don\u2019t need to hear that.", "This is exactly what I told him, but he said that my BIL was his guest not mine.", "The 4 days was a huge warning sign to me as well - like, if he does these completely inappropriate things within 4 days, what's happening in 30? He's 27, an adult who should absolutely know better. I hope the husband smartens up quickly, because he's majorly disrespecting his wife at this stage.", "The husband is being an AH to OP.

Like, playing video games late at night without headphones in is bad enough, and something that I also think doesn't need to be said, but their sex woke up a child who thought the gf was yelling - what 27yo doesn't know not to do that? Also, he invited the gf around for dinner without checking with OP and her husband first, and then expected she could stay the night without really asking - all of these feel like they're not necessarily ground rules so much as \"adults know how to behave when they're guests in somebody's house\".", "The house belongs to BOTH of you.

This will be the last question.", "He just brought her over for the night without asking and then made something up to get you to agree.", "You can ask whatever, his tough time was him dropping out of college that my husband and his parents were paying for. He\u2019s doing odd jobs but decided on being a fitness coach", "NTA then, he dropped out of college and has a job, I think he gonna be fine. He's also healthy too so that's a plus. I'm sure he can rent an apartment and get some insurance and then he fine.", "NTA. And your husband says his brother made one mistake? AU contraire, OP! Let us count the mistakes!\n\n1. Playing video games loudly on night one.\n2. Bringing a girlfriend around unexpectedly\n3. Bringing alcohol around your kids \n4. Having his girlfriend drink in front of your kids\n5. Sneakily timing the visit with the drinking and surprise! She can\u2019t get home that night. (Weird all her friends are out of town, too\u2026)\n6. Asking to have his girlfriend stay one night.\n7. Getting loud with the girlfriend in the room next to your kids - so loud your child complained about the noise.\n8. After you asking them to tone it down, they don\u2019t!

He didn't really as, or inform that is something he desired.  He waited until it was too late to force the issue.\n\nThat is rude.  That would be enough to kick him out of the house, IMO.\n\nThen the last of respect for your children and you.  No one wants to hear other people having sex. \n\nBIL is a guest in the house.  He isn't paying rent.  He is taking liberties with your kindness.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhat is wrong with your husband?\n\nDoes he not value your family, esp the kids?\nHuge, monstrously ginormous, horrible example for the kids.", "Your BIL doesn't respect you.

You\u2019re a super woman to kick him out quickly!  Good for you!!!", "NTA.  Your husband is the AH as well as his brother.  Kick out BIL and let husband understand that there will be no compromise on this.  Back this up with whatever you have to do to make him understand that you will not back down.  If your husband continues to disregard your wishes on this matter, take note.  Plan the future accordingly.  Protect yourself.", "YTA\n\nGranted, he could be a bit less noisy, but he hasn't really done anything terribly out of line. You did kind of overreact by throwing him out of the house so quickly.

You are never getting him out of that house ever.", "Well, you and I know that, but clearly the BIL did not.", "Yeah, I'd just hate to think that this needs to be stated at the start of an arrangement. \"You're moving in for a month, I expect you to clean up after yourself, not play loud videogames at night while the kids are sleeping, and not have your girlfriend around for loud sex in the room next to my children\" should feel like overkill lol.", "Ah, that radio/YouTube ad!", "Know what I absolutely wouldn\u2019t do if someone was gracious enough to host me in their home for a month?\n\nHave guests over. Or bang them. \n\nHow incredibly rude and presumptuous of him. Also, why can\u2019t he stay with his girlfriend?\n\nHere\u2019s my list of assholes (spoiler alert, you\u2019re not on the list):\n\n- BIL, obviously, for taking advantage of your hospitality and disrespecting you, your kids, and your home. \n\n- the girlfriend, for not having the decency to not come over and drink and bang in your house. \n\n- your husband, for enabling his lazy idiot brother financially, for being a crappy partner (why didn\u2019t he prep the guest room for HIS GUEST?),  for not having your back, and for undermining your authority. \n\nYou and the kids are the ones NTA in this story.", "You should just take the kids and leave.

Your husband is being a bad father and a bad husband. His brother has no respect for any of you and since he's going to be sleeping with strange women in your house, you need to be really careful with your kids and your valuables. You shouldn't have to put up with this in your own home.", "NTA. Him and your husband can leave.", "What is wrong with you?", "NTA  Two yes/one no rule. You BOTH have to agree or it doesn't happen.

He's an oversized child, and now he knows he can get away with anything, and that his brother (your spineless husband) will let him get away with it.  Expect loud gaming sessions at night, lots of drinking, and that he'll be \"loudly intimate\" with his girlfriend anytime he feels like it.\n\nYour husband has pretty much failed as a husband and father here.

This man is not respecting you or your home. Why did you let him back in.", "NTA. You realise that he has no intention of leaving in a month right?  I don't think having a drink should be a big deal, but getting drunk and loudly shagging a stranger in your house is totally unacceptable.  I would get rid of him at all costs.", "NTA take your kids to a hotel on your husbands dime!", "The only mistake you've made is letting him back in the house.  \nWhy can he live with his girlfriend?  \n\n\nAlso you know '*live with us for a month*' is a massive lie yes?

That's the house you raise your children in, they should not be hearing some random girl having sex with their uncle. Or be exposed to him being drunk. Your husband is prioritizing his brother over you and your very young kidd and that's just wrong.

No cooking for him, no laundry - not your guest means not your responsibility.", "Why can\u2019t he move in with his parents?", "NTA. Your husband is really letting you down here.
