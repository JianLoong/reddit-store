I agreed and went off cleaning the guest bed room for him. My husband brother is 27 years old he didn\u2019t want to attend college like his older sister and brother instead he worked at a small IT company nearby. The guest bedroom was upstairs near my kids rooms and ours was downstairs.  I wake up in the night and just hear machine and gun noises coming from upstairs. I thought my son was playing his game upstairs so I sleepily walked up there to only see him asleep instead it was my BIL. I asked him if he could turn down the volume so we could sleep he quietly agreed and apologized for the noise. Nothing happened and I went to bed. \n\n\n\n\nThe next day he introduces a woman to us. He\u2019s says this is his girlfriend and that they have been dating for 2 months now they also brought over some drinks which I didn\u2019t  like in front of the kids so I asked if we could drink a little later tonight. He agreed but his girlfriend was already drinking out of a plastic cup I told my kids to head upstairs and just started cooking dinner. \n\n\nHours go by and my husband comes home from work and we start setting the dinner table. After dinner my BIL asks if his girlfriend spends the night because it\u2019s too late to get an Uber at this time.

He could have gone to girlfriends place if they wanted to spend the night. He seems inconsiderate- he should have checked with you guys first before inviting people over or drinking in front of your kids. Thats basic courtesy when you are a house guest.", "NTA. You asked him nicely multiple times to be quieter and he didn\u2019t listen.

If he cant even do the minimal amount a respectful guest would do he should not be there.", "NTA, to do that right next to young kids is DISGUSTING.  Period. If he can't control himself for a night with his girl when next door to children, I would have kicked him out with his pants around his ankles that night. Uber prices be damned.", "NTA,\n\nIt wasn't one mistake. For a bro who is almost 30, he sure doesn't have many social cues.\n\nNoise, drinking and loud sex - he doesn't have a clue he's a guest in a home and YOU are the only having to deal with parenting him. A few days of that was more than enough and more than you should have had to. I'm sorry you husband sucks, too.\n\nIf dude has a GF he can go stay with her.", "INFO, was he begging you for him to stay or did he and his girlfriend just go for the uber right after you told them to leave?", "NTA\n\nBut now you know why it's important to establish ground rules at the start of such arrangements.", "NTA.", "NTA.

Kids don\u2019t need to hear that.", "This is exactly what I told him, but he said that my BIL was his guest not mine.", "The 4 days was a huge warning sign to me as well - like, if he does these completely inappropriate things within 4 days, what's happening in 30? He's 27, an adult who should absolutely know better. I hope the husband smartens up quickly, because he's majorly disrespecting his wife at this stage.", "The husband is being an AH to OP.

Like, playing video games late at night without headphones in is bad enough, and something that I also think doesn't need to be said, but their sex woke up a child who thought the gf was yelling - what 27yo doesn't know not to do that? Also, he invited the gf around for dinner without checking with OP and her husband first, and then expected she could stay the night without really asking - all of these feel like they're not necessarily ground rules so much as \"adults know how to behave when they're guests in somebody's house\".", "The house belongs to BOTH of you.

This will be the last question.", "He just brought her over for the night without asking and then made something up to get you to agree.", "You can ask whatever, his tough time was him dropping out of college that my husband and his parents were paying for. He\u2019s doing odd jobs but decided on being a fitness coach", "NTA then, he dropped out of college and has a job, I think he gonna be fine. He's also healthy too so that's a plus. I'm sure he can rent an apartment and get some insurance and then he fine."]}
