{"id": 7308, "submission_id": "10bnywp", "title": "AITA for wanting to be pay for babysitting my own daughter?", "selftext": "My (39M) wife (34F) and I live in at a suburban house with our daughter (10F, Emily). Our neighbour next door (48M, Walter) is a single father with two daughters (14F and 12F). We have been living here for a little more than two years.\n\nMy wife really likes watching scary movies but I have never enjoy them. I get too scared and end up having a bad time so I prefer to avoid them. Her friends sometimes go with her to the more popular ones but she also likes older, indies and foreign horror movies. She has always had a hard time finding people that have this niche interest and that is why it was such a big deal when we met Walter and found out he also shares this tendency. They very quickly started to make plans to watch movies together. I was invited to be a part of this but refused.\n\nI prefer to just stay at home babysitting Emily and Walter's daughter while they are in their cinephile reunions. Sometimes they go to movie theaters but other times they just stay at Walter's place watching stuf at his home cinema. They usually have to go to another town in order to catch a specific function of some weird movie so it is normal for them to come back very late.\n\nThey eventually started doing stuff outside of watching movies, like going out for dinner. Walter invited all of us, including the kids, to go with him to a restaurant that a friend of him owned but I said no because it was too expensive. I don't like that kind of places because I feel they are a waste of money and didn't think the kids would enjoy it either. I insisted on staying with the kids and let the two of them go be themselves. This has became a regular thing and it is in a way a good deal for me because Walter pays for my wife's dinner and she can't no longer complain about me not taking her to fancy restaurants.\n\nAs both their movie and dinner nights had became so common, I have grown a little tired of the burden of constantly babysitting the girls. I talk to my wife and Walter about it and he explained that he usually does not like leaving his duaghters with babysitters. He says he is really comfortable knowing that they are being watched by an experienced father like me instead of some teenage girl. He nevertheless agreed that it was too much of a load for me and offered to start paying me a standard babysitter fee each time he goes out with my wife.\n\nI thought that was a fair approach to the issue but my wife was fully against it. She says I should not be paid for babysitting my own daughter nor the daughters of a close friend of our family like Walter. We have been arguing about this but she insists on this notion and it not open to change. She even gets mad every time I talk to her about this. Walter promised me that he will convince her but he does not seem to have been able to do so either.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1673701451, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bnywp/aita_for_wanting_to_be_pay_for_babysitting_my_own/", "score": 4864, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Actually, that's called parenting.\n\nOn a side note, why not just ask your wife for as many days off of parenting duty as she gets when she's out with Walter? For instance, if they go to dinner and movies once a month, why not just ask your wife to get one evening off per month where she has to watch your child?\n\nThat would probably make you feel better about her having all the fun time without you getting any time off.", "Hahahahhaa!\n\nYou want to get PAID for being with your kid??\n\nWill your wife also be paid for doing the dishes, laundry, and dealing with your bullshit??\n\nYTA.", "YTA for so many reasons. I\u2019m having a really tough time believing that anyone is this clueless. Your wife is dating, you think parenting is babysitting. You don\u2019t actually have to watch his kids. I see where the money would be attractive to you, the surgery to remove your head from your anus must be very expensive.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t babysit your own kid.  The neighbor\u2019s child is a different story.  But I think your marriage is in trouble.  You\u2019ve essentially isolated yourself from activities with your wife.  You seem completely fine with another man wining and dining your spouse.  This is not going to end well.", "EDIT based on a re-read and reinterpretation of the question: NTA for asking/agreeing to payment from Walter for watching his kids (even though if it were me, I might not accept money from him considering he\u2019s a good friend of the family). It doesn\u2019t appear that you actually asked for money to watch your own kid. \n\nFor all the things you didn\u2019t explicitly ask about though, I\u2019m getting all sorts of AH vibes. First of all, if it\u2019s your kid, you are not babysitting, you\u2019re parenting. Any time a parent says that they are babysitting their own child, I question how involved that parent is in the upbringing and care of that child. I\u2019m betting your wife is Emily\u2019s primary caretaker. \n\nSecondly, at 10, 12, and 14, these kids really don\u2019t require much actual \u201cwatching.\u201c They are old enough to get their own meals and take care of themselves and entertain themselves. All you really need to do is make sure you\u2019re there in case of an emergency. The 14-year-old is old enough to watch the other two, if we\u2019re being honest. She\u2019s the age of a freshman in high school at this point. Walter needs to allow her to be more autonomous. \n\nThird, if scary movies aren\u2019t your thing, you watching Walters kids or just making sure they have a trusted adult to rely on in an emergency while he and your wife get their scary movie fix is a perfect thing to trade for Walter watching your daughter while you take your wife out every so often. While you have different interests, getting married doesn\u2019t mean you stop dating (unless you eventually want someone else to swoop in and start dating your wife). It sounds like Walter is dating your wife more than you are, even if their relationship is purely platonic. You indicated you don\u2019t enjoy taking her to fancy restaurants, but if she enjoys it, why are you so against the idea? \n\nLast, there is room for compromise here. If Walter has a movie room, why don\u2019t you and your wife and Walter and all of the kids get together once a week and watch a movie everyone enjoys?  It sounds like you don\u2019t want to be involved any more than you have to with either the fun stuff or the harder parts of being a parent. Step up and be an equal partner.", "You do know they're fucking, right? Lolol.", "From what I'm reading, you only want WALTER to pay you for watching HIS kids, but your wife doesn't want you to accept that money?

And, in this case, I can understand why you would be warn down by doing it all the time and you have every right to bring it up and express your burnout. \n\nSince they are going out for fun, and quite often, it's understandable that you might feel burnt out a little. And it's perfectly reasonable for them to offer you some compensation for taking on the extra responsibility instead of just assuming and expecting you to take it on. And you wouldn't be an ahole for accepting it. It's not like it's a one-time thing or a favor here and there...It's starting to become like a \"job\" kind of thing.

Our neighbour next door (48M, Walter) is a single father with two daughters (14F and 12F). We have been living here for a little more than two years.\n\nMy wife really likes watching scary movies but I have never enjoy them. I get too scared and end up having a bad time so I prefer to avoid them. Her friends sometimes go with her to the more popular ones but she also likes older, indies and foreign horror movies. She has always had a hard time finding people that have this niche interest and that is why it was such a big deal when we met Walter and found out he also shares this tendency. They very quickly started to make plans to watch movies together. I was invited to be a part of this but refused.\n\nI prefer to just stay at home babysitting Emily and Walter's daughter while they are in their cinephile reunions. Sometimes they go to movie theaters but other times they just stay at Walter's place watching stuf at his home cinema. They usually have to go to another town in order to catch a specific function of some weird movie so it is normal for them to come back very late.\n\nThey eventually started doing stuff outside of watching movies, like going out for dinner. Walter invited all of us, including the kids, to go with him to a restaurant that a friend of him owned but I said no because it was too expensive. I don't like that kind of places because I feel they are a waste of money and didn't think the kids would enjoy it either. I insisted on staying with the kids and let the two of them go be themselves. This has became a regular thing and it is in a way a good deal for me because Walter pays for my wife's dinner and she can't no longer complain about me not taking her to fancy restaurants.\n\nAs both their movie and dinner nights had became so common, I have grown a little tired of the burden of constantly babysitting the girls. I talk to my wife and Walter about it and he explained that he usually does not like leaving his duaghters with babysitters. He says he is really comfortable knowing that they are being watched by an experienced father like me instead of some teenage girl. He nevertheless agreed that it was too much of a load for me and offered to start paying me a standard babysitter fee each time he goes out with my wife.\n\nI thought that was a fair approach to the issue but my wife was fully against it. She says I should not be paid for babysitting my own daughter nor the daughters of a close friend of our family like Walter. We have been arguing about this but she insists on this notion and it not open to change. She even gets mad every time I talk to her about this. Walter promised me that he will convince her but he does not seem to have been able to do so either.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So, yeah, pay OP an allowance like the child he is.", "At what point is he typing this out and not connecting the dots. He\u2019s literally facilitating an affair.", "This dude is getting absolutely dunked on and it's f'ing hilarious. Walter out there slicking dick with the wife while this guy pouts about not getting paid to watch his kids LOL. AT LEAST PAY ME TO WATCH YOUT KIDS WHILE YOU RAIL MY WIFE!", "So he is babysitting the kids of the guy that is banging his wife?", "kind of? man's straight up like \"thank god someone can date my wife so i don't have to!\"", "In principle yes, but it sure sounds like this is the primary relationship and leisure activity in her life.", "It\u2019s the staying late for me. They\u2019re neighbors, can\u2019t they plan the viewings at Walter\u2019s house earlier in the day? Also it sounds like Walter\u2019s kids are at OPs house while they\u2019re up late watching a movie. At Walter\u2019s house - if that\u2019s the case major red flags that there is indeed something more than a  platonic friendship going on.", "I mean, I probably wouldn't blame her. They don't have to be involved in everything, but they should be involved in *some things*.", "He doesn't *care*. He does genuinely seem to be too oblivious to understand, but that obliviousness comes from a place of complete apathy. He doesn't even care enough to think through the obvious consequences of neglecting his wife while encouraging her to spend all of her time with someone who openly values her more than he does. If poly relationships were more socially acceptable and common, he'd probably be perfectly unperturbed if Walter and his wife wanted one. Might not even need that if, either.", "I forgot about child support and alimony. This guys in for a shock.

If I knew how awards worked or had any I would give them to you. Worded perfectly!", "I am 100% against cheating and I find it so hard to justify cheating being wrong in this case. They seem to be married on paper only.", "That's one of the weirdest things to me about this. OP is controlling what Walter's kids do too. He literally says he doesn't think they'd enjoy going out to dinner etc. Who is he to decide for someone else's kids?", "Actually, he's parenting his daughter and her friend. Part of parenting is that your kid will socialize, and that you have to supervise that activity. Babysitting only happens when none of the kids are your own.", "Parents host other people's kids all the time. \nIt's not babysitting... it's facilitating your own child's social life.", "Eh, they check out, taking it all for granted, until the hammer drops and she leaves. That's when they freak the fuck out.", "For it to cross his mind, he'd have to care. He legitimately seems to be unbothered by every aspect of this situation except for the fact that he feels caring for his own child and his wife's boyfriend's child should be a paid activity.", "Why would he want that? He hates doing all those things. He also can\u2019t be bothered to find things both he and his wife enjoy doing. He\u2019d rather coast along giving zero fucks and spending his time on God knows what.", "If Walter\u2019s kids don\u2019t need child care, then Walter is free to leave them at home.

That's basically your dad paying for you to get a new friend", ">They keep inviting OP, so it\u2019s a stretch on what they are doing.\n\nMaybe at first.  But OP keeps declining AC activities with his wife \n\n\"Now she can't complain i don't take her out to dinner\"\n\nA dinner date isn't about food, it's about enjoying each other's company", "There's an episode of the Simpsons where Homer does this exact thing. After suffering a herniated disc and pushing Marge to hang with Smithers. The humor to that episode for me was that after Marge spends time with Smithers, she goes home to only shag Homer. I was initially wondering if Op's bedroom is still just as lively, but he sounds more & more done with everything. Then I let my bf see this and he said \"Does Op know *HE'S* the single neighbor in this situation?\" So random internet folks can see the issue. And unless Op was looking for an easy way out of his marriage, or something. He definitely needs to get off his ass & start spending time with his wife himself.", "I see going to my daughter's graduation as a waste of time and gas money, luckily Walter drove them and attended.", "Sounds like a keeper.\n\nI'm waiting for an update to show up on the front page.", "Genuinely he sounds like my now ex husband: completely apathetic toward me and my interests. We played the same multi-player games and my friends through that game wanted him to join in. He said no. He loves board games so much, but when I wanted to introduce him to my really good friend and have a game night with her, he didn't want to. I asked him why and he said, \"I have enough friends.\" Says the man who previously said I was his only friend. He also didn't want to ever go hiking with me even when I wanted to go for my birthday.\n\nIt was almost like he put a ring on it and stopped trying.", "Gives big \"my wife's boyfriend\" energy", "I get that they both like the same type of movies, but I'm starting to wonder what OP has in common with his wife.  It doesn't sound like they have time for any date nights.\n\nMaybe Walter could watch the kids, and OP could try going out sometime.  I do mean WITH his wife...", "I kept reading this as his wife is having an affair. And if she's not, she'll be leaving him soon for Walter. Omg OP...you don't even go put to dinner with your wife!!! You're seriously the AH and soon to be ex.", "Because people think romance is the next step of friendship, instead of them being two whole and separate things. You can have a friendship where romance blooms, but the friendship doesn't change. It's just gets built upon. \n\nHomeboy is married to his wife but he's not friends with her.", "If he were just gullible, he'd join them on their dinners. They'd have movie visits together (just not to the horror movies). There'd be nights where Walter was the one watching the kids while he and his wife went out to do things.\n\nThis definitely isn't gullible. He's just too disinterested in his partner's needs to care whether they're satisfied or not, or even whether someone else is the one doing the satisfying. Pun intended.", "I feel like OP won\u2019t even care. It doesn\u2019t sound like he wants the slightest thing to do with his wife. Just throw some pocket money his way and he\u2019ll be good.", "I agree. He could easily go out every time his wife and Walter do - and maybe Walter pays the 14-year-old a little for babysitting. Fourteen is prime babysitting age and it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a baby involved. Frankly at those ages I was into horror movies too and would have preferred to join them to see them. OP sounds like he\u2019s checked out and is using the kids as an excuse to sit home and not do anything with his wife. And probably not much with the kids either - they very well may all be sitting around watching movies too!", "I've never seen somebody so emotionally lethargic", "I don\u2019t think that makes it excusable but I can totally get where the wife is coming from IF that is going on, because the husband seems to be uninterested in everything the wife asks for. I get the scary movies because it does trigger some people, but dinner there\u2019s no excuse imo. Get a real babysitter.", "He'll start a spreadsheet to track his paid OT once they start getting hotel rooms together for the weekend.", "For the Cadillacs and gas money spent", "OP seems fine being a roommate. They are pretty much in a dead marriage at this point, to the point where OP is PERFECTLY FINE with another guy taking his wife out to dinner.\n\nHonestly, I still don't think they're cheating because I could reasonably justify this as OP's wife having a really close friend. My entire problem is that your husband should be your BEST friend, but the guy is totally dropping the ball and borderline ignoring his wife.", "Exactly. Unless your kid is really immature or you live in a bad neighborhood, I don\u2019t see how a 14 year can\u2019t be home alone for 3-4 hours.", "I find this pushover behaviour very common, especially in men who just like to \u201cwatch\u201d.", "Plot twist. OP is gay but too shy to say and hoping that Walter replaces him in his duties. Lol", "I mean, it's fine if he can't deal with scary movies so she goes with a friend. It's the refusing to even go to dinner with her that gets me ...", "This is the thing. I have very different taste in music to my husband but I have bought him tickets for a band he likes because it's so long since he went to a gig (plus it was his birthday). He wants me to go with him and I'll go and we'll have a great night. It's not my kind of music. But I'll try something new and I'll be happy that he's happy. Isn't that part of what marriage is about?", "AND he initially was invited to most of these activities at the beginning and basically chose to offer himself up as a babysitter. Now he\u2019s grown tired of the \u201cburden\u201d", "Yeah this is definitely not going to work out well for OP. Eventually his wife will realize that there are men who like their wives, men who like her. That it's normal to want and to expect that your partner would enjoy spending time with you and that you would both do activities together that each of you like. I'm guessing his attitude towards making his wife happy transfers to other areas of their lives too.

It reminded me of what some of my friends call their \"gymnastics husband\" which is a guy who shares their love of going to gymnastics meets, unlike their husband.  Not a threat to the marriage, just a friend really.

Yeah i agree it's going to backfire xD", "OP sounds like the world\u2019s biggest stick in the mud\u2026 and very clueless.

Like why is he even married to her if he wants NOTHING to do with her?", "It sounds like OP doesn't like his wife enough to participate in their marriage.

You don\u2019t pay or pay retail price in these situations usually. \n\nI think OP is really screwing things up when there was no need, and now is just digging a hole towards divorce with every further action. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t assume an affair, but I\u2019d think husband is playing a game he invented and is going to lose. \n\nYTA", "Honestly, kids that age don't even necessarily need a sitter or parent at home.", "You make a good point", "He didn't ask for money, but said he would accept it when the neighbor offered.", "Cooking dinner maybe.

But if I had a partner who was passionate about it, I'd go out of my way to find at least a few things we could watch that I know they'd enjoy. To be so willing to completely boycott a major hobby of their makes me wonder why they got married and why they're still together. \n\nThe dinner thing is ridiculous, but mostly because OP only seems to want to say no to plans.
