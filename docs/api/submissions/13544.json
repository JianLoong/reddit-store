But beyond that...you weren't even home!  Having strangers in your home when neither you nor your husband are there is a huge violation.  This needs to be stopped immediately or you're going to end up \"hosting\" everything that anyone else doesn't want to whether you're there or not.  How would you like to come home from vacation to find out your place had been used as a hotel while you were away because your niece/sibling/inlaw just wanted to get away from the family for awhile...and you weren't using the house so why not?\n\nYour home is not communal property.

First off, the fact that she did not ask but \u201cinformed\u201d you is a major lack of respect. Strike two was deceiving you about the whole class coming.

There are two red flags in what happened.  1.  Your MIL \"told\"you to open your home up to your niece to work on a project.  It's your home.

MIL either lied about the number or niece took advantage.\n\nYou are wise to put your foot down now.  How old were the nieces and classmates?
