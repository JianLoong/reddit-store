But if someone entered free of charge and not for performing a service you're AFAIK only responsible for things happening because of serious neglect of standard safety measures.

They may not always win but you\u2019ll have to spend money and time dealing with court.", "This is another unfortunate side effect of our lack of affordable healthcare, and the greed of insurance companies. And sometimes the greed of the individuals involved.\n\nIf little Timmy breaks his arm at your house, the hospital/his insurance provider might ask where this occurred. When Timmy's parents' insurance provider finds out that it happened at YOUR house, they might refuse to pay for treatment. Timmy's parents can't afford the exorbitant hospital bill, so they (or their insurance company) will sue YOU for the money, because the injury happened in your home, under your watch. So hopefully you have quality coverage under your homeowner's insurance, but you're still fucked over. Because even if there's no negligence found, your insurance company will probably offer a settlement payment, and your premiums will go up regardless, just because someone made a claim against your insurance.\n\nPlus, people can sue for anything. Doesn't mean they'll win, but if Timmy gets hurt at your house, his parents can sue you. Then you're caught up in legal fees and court appearances, or you're utilizing your homeowner's insurance to handle this-- and yet, again, your premiums go up and your insurance will probably settle because it's cheaper than fighting it in court.\n\nThis isn't something that happens all the time, but it's happened enough times that people are wary of it.", "In the US, for a lot of injuries your health insurance sends you a letter and you have to respond where and how the injury happened.

If the injury happened on someone else\u2019s property, your health insurance will pay the bills, but they\u2019ll sue the homeowner\u2019s insurance to get their money back. \n\n\nIf you don\u2019t provide that information your medical bills won\u2019t be covered, and most of us can\u2019t afford to pay OOP after it has been run through insurance (once a hospital has run the bill through insurance, they bill you the rate they bill the insurance company, NOT the rate they negotiated with the insurance company, and NOT the rate you can negotiate if you know you\u2019re self paying OOP before you get treatment). \n\n\nI\u2019m very fortunate that every time I\u2019ve had an injury that resulted in one of those letters, it was in my own home.\n\nNTA", "ESH.

If you're injured on someone else's property, if there's evidence they were negligent or otherwise caused the injury, that's what their liability coverage is for. But liability covers injuries & damage to *other parties*, so if you're the one injured on your property, it won't apply.", "Oh my, your system is so broken! \n\nIs this the reason why people sue each other so much?", "Thanks! I\u2019ve always wondered if they could. I mostly stopped getting the letters after my response was repeatedly (and honestly) I dislocated my knee, which made me fall, which made me need (insert testing/treatment for resulting injuries). I wear my KAFOs outside my home, and they keep me from dislocating my patella, which is why the injuries all occurred in my home. You can\u2019t wear KAFOs 24/7."]}
