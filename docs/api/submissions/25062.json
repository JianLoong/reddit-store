And most times when they do it, they will always laugh and say \"Oh look at X (me), he's so embarrassed, we're teaching him etc.\". It's pretty annoying tbh rather than 'embarrassing'.\n\nLast week, during one of these conversations I politely asked them if they could stop and maybe not discuss this when I'm around or make it a point to address me during these conversations. One of them got annoyed and said I was being immature and it's something I need to expect working in a female-dominated environment.  They even said I was proving their point and that I don't need to be uncomfortable around what's a normal bodily function. I went home to my wife and told her about this and she said I was an AH to tell them about this.

Absolutely fucking not. This is harassment and it's a shame that these women are setting us back 50 years because they want to tease you.\n\nIf you have an HR department I think it's worth reporting.
