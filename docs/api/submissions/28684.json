Jess has Parker (11M) from a previous relationship and Kyle has Bodie (15M) from his first marriage. Bodie's mom died when he was 5 or 6. Ever since Jess and Kyle got married, Bodie has been pretty clear about not seeing Jess and Parker as his mom/bonus mom or brother. Parker adores Bodie, though. \n\nEarly in the relationship and again in the marriage my other sister Chantelle and I brought up to Jess that she should really listen to Bodie. Jess got this idea into her head that the boys were bonding and Bodie adored Parker as much as Parker adored him. Bodie always said he was an only child and Parker would never be just his brother/his real brother. Jess didn't listen to us and she lived in this fantasy world.\n\nLast year Parker was diagnosed with cancer. Broke all our hearts because he was so scared and treatment has been awful for him but he is coming out on the other side.\n\nBodie's feelings and relationship did not change when Parker got cancer. He's still distant and not very emotionally attached to Parker. My sister kinda noticed then but said that she still believed Bodie would be there for Parker if he needed him.\n\nA few weeks ago Bodie won tickets to an amusement park Parker loves. He hasn't been able to go for a while because he was sick and Jess and Kyle are financially struggling due to Parker's cancer and things they had to pay for in that time. So money is tight. Bodie said he invited his best friend to go with him. Kyle suggested that he should take Parker and he said no. He said he wanted to go with his friend not with Parker. Parker had already been told about the tickets and he really wanted to go with Bodie. He adores Bodie and thinks he is the coolest and best person in the world. He was crushed when he heard.\n\nJess and Kyle sat down and talked to Bodie about how much it would mean to Parker and how it would be a kind thing to give him something fun to do and the two could enjoy it together. Bodie said no and he mentioned that he left the tickets with his friend and his friends parents so Jess and Kyle couldn't use them how they wanted.\n\nJess is pissed. She's angry that Bodie is being this way and has been blindsided by how little Bodie cares about Parker's happiness and the fact he wouldn't jump at the chance for them to have a fun day together when they could have lost parker. Chantelle and her already fought over it and Chantelle told Jess she had no business hating the kid and he didn't choose this. When she came to me and asked why Chantelle was so pissed at her and why neither of us seemed to be shocked, I said it's because we believed him when he said Parker wasn't his brother and I said she should have really listened and believed him too.\n\nJess cried and yelled at me and told me Bodie was a kid and still is one and kids can say things they don't mean all the time. She said we expected way too much of her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697019123, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175ajin/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_should_have/", "score": 822, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is sad that one boy adores the other and the older one doesn't feel the same, but just because the parents blend a family, and want that family to \\*be\\* a family, doesn't mean that it will happen that way.  Cancer or no cancer.\n\nJess brought this on herself, by never listening to her stepson, and choosing a fantasy instead.  I understand that she wants her son to have a brother but... that isn't Bodie's responsibility.  He has been adament since day one that that wasn't what he was going to do, and yeah, sure, kids *can* change their minds, just like anyone can... but they can also NOT change their minds.\n\nPersonally, I think it was very smart of Bodie to *not* keep the tickets at home, because you can guarantee that Jess would have stolen them to force Bodie to do what she wanted him to do.\n\nHe is a person.  Not her son's comfort toy.  And, don't get me wrong, I do feel awful for Parker, because I can see it from his side as well, he wants a big brother who loves him... but at the end of the day, Bodie and Parker *each* have a choice about what relationship they have.  Bodie has chosen none.  As is his right.  Is it sad for Parker?  Yes, and probably made all the worse by him mom telling him over and over again that Bodie feels or is something that Bodie is clearly not.  But again.  Not Bodie's responsibility.", "NTA and damn. The fact that Bodie left the tickets at a safe place, which is not his home, speaks volumes. The audacity of parents often shocks me when it comes to forced 'blended family' relations. Especially if its not about young kids but a FIFTEEN year old. Bodie can almost vote, drink, drive, marry and join the millitary but his stepmom thinks he is a dumb child who says things he does not mean? Your sisters attitude  leaves me dumbfounded, they told parker to guilt trip bodie.", "They expect a 15 year old to go alone with a cancer patient in an amusement park? That doesn't sound like a good idea. It's sad for Parker but it would also be unfair for Bodie. The parents would be TA if they take this negatively against Bodie.", "NTA, the tickets belong to Bodie so he decides who goes with him. Also, forcing him to take Parker will only cause Bodie to resent him more. Plus if Parker is still ill, he will be tired easily and may need Bodie to slow down for him or potentially even go home early. Your sister needs to let Bodie be a kid. Don't expect him to act like an adult, because he's not.", "A 15 year old taking an 11 year old he doesn't care about (and has/had cancer) to an amusement park on their own is a recipe for disaster. Your sister isn't being realistic about anything. The fact that the kid knew to leave the tickets with his friend so they couldn't steal them is telling. Your sister needs to face reality. NTA. Bodie has probably already basically lost his dad and financial security to your sister and nephew. This isn't going to be fixed.", "NTA. \n\nNo 15 year old wants to go to the amusement park with an 11 year old over his friend- sibling or not. \n\nI feel bad for both Bodie and Parker. \n\nBodie lost his mom and then suddenly his dad is remarried- and no one in this family seems to respect his feelings. He was probably brushed aside for the entire past year while Parker was dealing with cancer.  \n\nParker has had to deal with a devastating diagnosis at a young age. He desperately wants a relationship with his older step brother, and the brother wants nothing to do with that. And the parents refuse to face reality and probably continue to encourage these unreciprocated feelings. \n\nThe real assholes are the parents here. I think it\u2019s incredibly telling that Bodie is keeping the tickets with his friend. Bodie is going to leave at 18 and never look back.", "When someone tells you who they are\u2026\nNTA.

And none of the parents want to hear Bodie when he talks about his feelings and needs, and he is a child like Parker.  \nOf course, your sister, as a mother, cares very much about Parker and wants the best for him, but this should not be at the expense of Bodie", "NTA, but man, I feel bad for Parker. He should have never been told about the tickets. \n\nI do wonder if perhaps bodie would be agreeable to going with him another time under different circumstances, though. Perhaps everyone could pool their money and gift the kids and their parents (or another guardian) a visit together for Christmas, if the park is open then? Or perhaps the parents could afford for one of them to take only him? I'm sure he would prefer going together, but going alone would probably still be fun enough.", "Feel like people are losing sight of the question.\nNTA for telling your sister that she should listen to the kids instead of making up her fantasy world", "NTA. Jess fantasy of loving blended family is shattered. While I feel sorry for Parker, Bodie has right to decide who he likes and cares for. Maybe if he wouldn't be pushed to like Parker, he might warm up eventually. Maybe not. But pushing him to this is only creating more resentment.", "NTA, patchwork families are tough but it says a lot about their family dynamic if the tickets were hidden in a safe place.

Your sis is dillusional.", "NTA. \n\nPoor Bodie, I am horrified that this child\u2019s expression of how he feel is just being ignored. Jess has created a toxic situation here.

The fairy tale delusion shes been living in is shattered. Good on you for actually listening to the kid in the first place.", "NTA your sister has set Parker up for disappointment. Look up glass child, the child who is overlooked because of another sibling\u2019s illness or disability. Bodies indifference will change to resentment if this continues. What Parker is going through is awful. But that doesn\u2019t mean Bodie has to stop living his life.", "ESH- you know who I feel bad for here? Bodie. Is he allowed any autonomy? I just imagine how hard his life has been with everything being about Parker\u2019s cancer.

Kids say stuff they DO mean all the time, and 16 is definitely old enough to mean what he says about being an only child.

It\u2019s sad for Parker, but your sister is wrong in trying to force a relationship on them that isn\u2019t there.

Even if they were actually siblings, there's a 4 year age difference, which is a wide gap at their ages, so it's reasonable that the older kid would prefer to be with friends.", "NTA. \n\n>told me Bodie was a kid and still is one and kids can say things they don't mean all the time. She said we expected way too much of her.\n\nWhile kids do say things they don't mean, Bodie's actions spoke volumes. You guys tried to tell her, the bare minimum was hearing.

Bodie has been completely up front from the beginning. Your sister has been in complete denial.", "NTA\n\nPoor Bodie, being ignored and gaslit (that his feelings are wrong and he should, and does, feel that deep attachment to his stepmom and stepbro) for almost a decade! It sounds as if Bodie's attachment- and grief- for his deceased mom hasn't been validated and supported. Forcing the second marriage as a complete and adequate replacement for his dead mom is so cruelly invalidating of Bodie's loss and grief.\n\nIt seems as if Bodie's true feelings have been ignored and invalidated throughout this marriage. OPs sister and Bodie's dad created an imaginary Bodie who is as bonded to stepmom and stepbrother as the adults are. Real Bodie is routinely rejected. Imaginary Bodie \"naturally\" loves his \"little brother\" and wants to share everything with him. Dad and stepmom have fed this unrealistic expectation to the younger brother, too. That's why they told hom about Bodie's tickets and their expectation that little bro (unsupervised by an adult) would \"naturally\" be the one Bodie \"chose\" to invite.\n\nIf Bodie had been allowed to be himself, continue processing his grief and loss, and the dynamics of his new relationships with stepmom and stepbrother with full acceptance and support, he might have developed healthy attachments with the \"blended\" part of his family. Instead, there has been a relentless campaign to erase and replace real Bodie with the fantasy version.", "NTA you are right and I feel bad for both kids. I am sure it must be hard to be guilt tripped into having feelings towards someone you just genuinely don't have. I am sure the situation for Bodie wasn't easy either with the parents surely being focused on Parker's sickness and money being tight, that means no fun things for either of the boys.

In these stories it\u2019s almost always the stepmom who\u2019s pushing for a closer relationship with an indifferent stepchild, and the OP is always the stepmom\u2019s sibling who has always known that the dynamic is not what the stepmom wants. Is this the MIL troll again? Are you testing out a new storyline?", "NTA - I feel really sorry for Parker\n\nPoor kid just wants his brothers love\n\nI don\u2019t blame Bodie at all, but my heart breaks for Parker", "ESH except Parker.\n\nThe parents suck for trying to force a relationship between their two stepbrothers.\n\nThe parents also suck for telling Parker about the tickets to the park in an effort to guilt trip Bodie into taking Parker.\n\nKyle also sucks for not teaching Bodie empathy for someone going through cancer treatment.  You don't need to have the closest relationship with someone who has cancer to have empathy for them, and it's clear that Bodie doesn't have any for Parker, regardless of how he might feel about him otherwise.\n\nAnd yeah, it totally sucks to be a teenage kid and for your parents' attention to be fully on the 'sick kid' and not on you, but guess what? My cousin was that very same 'sick kid' when she was growing up, her older brother was the same age as Bodie when she first got sick and he had more empathy in his little finger, and he would still have had more empathy in his little finger for her even if she wasn't his real sister and even if she was a complete stranger because that's just the kind of person he was raised as.\n\nBodie sucks for not having a single shred of empathy for a child going through cancer treatment. Again, it sucks to not be getting any attention when there's another member of the family that's sick, but he is old enough to know how serious cancer is, and he's old enough to be respectful to a child cancer patient and at least try and be helpful, and nothing has indicated that he's offered any kind of help. Nobody is saying that he has to suddenly start considering Parker as his brother or friend, but to care absolutely nothing and to refuse to help him at all even in this kind of scary situation when he's old enough to know better suggests that Bodie has no empathy, even for people who are obviously experiencing a lot of pain and suffering. And THAT is a much bigger problem than the park tickets.", "I don't think anyone is the ah here, it would've been the kind thing to do taking parker with him but hes allowed to have choices, but he has to live with his choices, they'll be a time when bodie wants to be included and parker will reject him as bodie has set the bar on what their relationship is, speak to family and friends or set up a gofundme and try raise some cash to give Parker a great day out that he deserves and let him decide who goes with him, if it excluded bodie then let it be", "It's a tough one. Is the kid allowed to have his own feelings, that he voiced over and over? Yes.\n\nIs your sister allowed to be angry and disappointed in how everything is?

Neither of those things are true anymore, he has a stepbrother, who is a sibling by marriage. \n\nImagine how that must feel for Parker? Jess isn\u2019t right for telling things that aren\u2019t true, but Bodie needs to be welcoming at least in the house. \n\nYou can\u2019t force blending of families, but it needs to be civil.

There's a large amount of distance between \"treat your stepbrother like he's family\" and \"take your stepbrother, who's a cancer patient, to an amusement park.\"\n\nThat said, it shouldn't be on Bodie to play babysitter for the day- assuming that \\*one\\* ticket won't break the bank, dad should come so that Bodie can do his own thing some of the time.  But overall, I think Bodie can and should do something nice for this kid while at the same time acknowledging that he \\*shouldn't\\* have to be a brother/son.  I suspect the \\*reason\\* Bodie is being an ass here is that he's not been treated with enough respect by stepmom & dad and is thus flexing his muscles now that he has power.

In a few years he will be in college or on his own. He *should* have friends and do things with friends. It is how growing up works. The fact that 15m kept the tickets at friends parents house says a lot. He doesn't trust stepmom and dad.\n\nAlso, 15M can't be *forced* to be best friends with 11M.

Nothing wrong with that thought process and it\u2019s accurate. \nI do feel for Parker. He would have been a young kid promised a big brother and it never came true, and his mothers persistence that it will wouldn\u2019t have helped matters.

Speaks of previous occasions where he's been forced to share, or his wishes trampled. OP is NTA and I'm glad Bodie has step-aunts who are advocating for his feelings.", "Agreed...\n\nI feel like a lot of parents of blended families really just want to know that they haven't made a mistake and \"destroyed\" their kids by divorce or widow/widowerhood, and in the US at least, the two parent nuclear family is so idealized that they are blinded by the reality of it all.  Do some blended families come together immediately?  Sure, I am sure they do.  But most don't, no matter how close in age the children are.\n\nThings like this take time, and the more the parents/parental figures push... well, the children can push back.  As happened here with Bodie.\n\nOne of the best things that happened to *me* when my parents split and my mom remarried soon after was that I went off with my dad to another state (loooooong soap opera story, this was not kidnapping, my parents both asked me which parent I wanted to stay with and I had about 5seconds to decide because my mom straight up decided to stay behind *the morning that we were moving from Colorado to Maryland* and they needed to know which car to move my bags to).  It was just me and my dad.  My mom, on the other hand, had my brother, and she remarried pretty quick, and while my step-siblings were both 10-15 years older than me, and thus adults, my stepdad's family was around all the time and my brother struggled with those adults trying to make 8 year old him (who had only just started feeling comfortable *with us* as a foreign adoptee) fit into *their* family, as if he had never been a part of ours.  Lots of other issues too, but my stepdad's brother and sister-in-law in particular are.... a lot.  And they are still around all. the. time.\n\nHad my mom and my stepdad not been so pushy about fitting him into a new reality, I think it would have gone a lot better.  It wasn't until my dad and I moved back a few years later that my brother had an actual safe space to go to.  It didn't do much, but it was something.  But it felt like we were the only people seeing how much my brother was being pushed to be something/someone/somewhere that he wasn't comfortable with, but he was just so young at the start that he couldn't really do much pushing back at the beginning.  Maybe if things had been allowed to happen more organically, it would have been different.  There is a lot underlying this, but the key point is... parents/adults who try to fit their children into the molds that they themselves have fashioned are going to be disappointed more often than they are satisfied.  And the children are the ones who are going to be the most affected by it all, either by shattered hopes (Parker) or by rejection of their own personhood (Bodie).", "Agreed.  The tickets being held outside Jess's reach really spoke volumes to me.", "Yeah it wouldn't surprise me if Jess sprung the boys with the occasional brother bonding things throughout the years. Should've just let the boys be for the most part but keep Parker in check so he gives Bodie his space and taught him appropriate boundaries and who knows maybe the boys could've been friends and eventually maybe even brothers. \n\nIt ain't gonna happen now probably since how much he's digging his heels in about not taking Parker and how he's nothing to him is pretty indicative of how years later even now he still views them as dad's wife and dad's wife's son.", "Yes, I would leave things at my friend\u2019s house all the time that I feared would get stolen or rifled through by my stepparent. Bodie absolutely doesn\u2019t trust their step mother.. \n\nSituation is a shame because I totally feel for Parker.

No, she had an expectation for what Bodie would be.  Not even *who* Bodie would be, but what piece of the puzzle.  What comfort toy for her son, even before the cancer.

Jesus christ.", "Reddit moment", "OMG, I read that story and caught Pikachu face myself haha. \n\nBut given their ages, I really feel for both Parker and Bodie in this situation.\n\nChronically sick kids often miss out on social development during their illness - which i get, parents are too tenderhearted to tell their child who might die to get over themselves in a socially appropriate way.\n\nBodie is meanwhile out here without a mom, and depending on how his mom died, Parker's illnesses might just be straight up triggering for him."]}
