It's a big accomplishment!", "NTA It's your graduation and your mom hasn't articulated any good reasons why you should attend.  If you have some elementary school teachers that you cherish and want to make them feel good, reach out to them individually and say thank you.  It will probably mean a lot more to them than seeing you do a random walk.", "NTA.", "NTA- it\u2019s your decision.

You made your feelings clear. They had 12 years to take pictures. Congratulations on graduating.", "Nta.  This is an opportunity for you.

I\u2019ve moved to the US from Australia and every where I look is bumper stickers, or yard signs, saying \u201c proud Parent of an (school name) student\u201d or Class of 23 at (school name). In Australia no one gives a shit where your kid goes, and one you leave school you don\u2019t think about it again unless you wind up sending your sprogs there", "NTA - Honestly, I think this is a stupid tradition. My son is currently in 2nd grade, and his school does the same thing when graduating seniors leave our HS. So far, 2/3 of his elementary school teachers have been just \"ok\" and 1 of them was a God-awful teacher. Unless one of them in the next 3 years really becomes a remarkable teacher and role model, I don't see any reason for my son to go back there when he's a graduating senior. Additionally, I don't think any of his teachers will be teaching by the time he graduates. They're all older and likely to retire out by then. \n\nIf you have a teacher that made an impact on your educational career, reach out personally and thank them. It's likely that they teacher wasn't one from your elementary days... \n\nYou're NTA. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR GRADUATION!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No trauma, illness or anything, so idk why.", "yeah, I'll be honest, I'm considering writing letters to the teachers i had who still teach there? i may not remember them but they did still help get me to where I am, so it wouldn't hurt any to at least thank them \ud83e\udd37", "Will they though? No one knows how sad or otherwise his former teachers will be and OP shouldn\u2019t base his decision on that.

I have one memory of being four, but I\u2019m not positive I didn\u2019t make it up from pictures. And 3 memories of elementary school- one of which I was being bullied about Santa, the other I was punched on the bus, and the third I embarrassed myself in math class by saying \u201ctwoth\u201d instead of \u201csecond\u201d.

It's your choice, not hers. NTA", "I did exactly this with my high school teachers. I didn't see a point in going to a 5 year reunion, but I wanted to let the teachers who had supported me know that I did well and now had a degree in the field that they had encouraged me to pursue. So I wrote a note to those two teachers letting them know how they helped me and that I appreciated their support.\n\nFrankly, I think the letter was more meaningful. I was a lot more detailed about how they helped me than I would've been in person because I would have felt awkward saying that type of speech in person. A group photo and \"hey, hi, thanks for being a great teacher!\" is a nice moment, but a letter is something they can hold onto and look at when they've had a shitty day at work.", "It's also a little bit about the little kids that get to watch you. They think it's cool to see the big kids they're gonna be someday. It does t really need to be about your own memories if you think about it like that.", "I have the same issue - if someone mentions something I can kind of access a memory about it, but I can't really draw up memories on my own of a very large portion of my life. I think some peoplea memories may just work that way, but I've also been told that depression interrupts memory making, so I think it's probably a combination.", "Maybe your mom doesn\u2019t understand what \u201coptional\u201d means \n\nNTA \n\nAnd congrats on graduation!", "Lol NTA; You don\u2019t have to take photos and walk through if you don\u2019t want to, but maybe be honest with your mom that you really really don\u2019t want to do it. If you truly don\u2019t care, then why push back so hard? The *point* would be to make your *mom* happy. \n\nAlso it is highly unusual to not have any memories of elementary and I guarantee that many if not all of your teachers will indeed recognize you and remember you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s disrespectful not to go, but I think you are being a bit immature about the whole thing. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to go - that\u2019s fine! But don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t care either way when your mom is pretty clearly invested.", "I mean, your not remembering trauma isn't the same as not having been traumatized, is it? \n\nThis is so weird to me. I can recall so many specific conversations, injuries, situations, etc., from all points of childhood. If you said, \"Third grade, school life, GO!\" I could talk for an hour. I just assumed almost everyone was the same. But now I find out there are lots of you! Brains are weird for sure.", ">but I've also been told that depression interrupts memory making,\n\nSo does anxiety!", "I mean, NTA for not wanting to do yet another photo op, but here's a personal anecdote that I ask you to consider. \n\n I switched schools between 4th and 5th grade, and my 4th grade teacher was one of my absolute favorites. She was also \"mysteriously\" let go a bit before the semester ended, and I never really got to say goodbye. My grad walk was for the school I attended for 5th grade, and really only went because my younger brother wanted to see me. Guess who was a new teacher at the school? And she did remember me  :)\n\nI'm not saying you'll have some grand moment of serendipity that'll make it worth it, but if it's not costing you anything you can at least say you had the experience."]}
