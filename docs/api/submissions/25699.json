If your wife isn't good enough to go to her wedding, then Sarah isn't good enough to come to the party. She has no right to complain.", "ESH - you pushed your wife into a confrontation she clearly didn't want. Sarah complaining to your friends over this is wildly hypocritical, if she thinks you both should \"understand\" not being invited to celebrate a milestone in her life with zero explanation then she should have the same understanding for herself in this situation.", "Yta. Not inviting someone and hoping they'll get your grudgy message in that action is childish. \nDid you ask at the time of the wedding why Jane wasn't invited?", "However shy she is.. your partner really needs to ask why she wasn't invited. Clarity is painful, but fog is like a snag that just keeps dragging at your mind", "Tell her you'd only be able to understand why your wife wasn't invited, if she actually explains why she wasn't invited.

Doesn't sound like a friendship to me.\nNTA", "Exactly, what are they supposed to \"understand\"", "I asked Jane to check it out but she didn't want to and she asked me not to either.

It isn\u2019t clear at all.\n\nLike why weren\u2019t either of them at the wedding?  Sarah can\u2019t get pissy about not going to parties of folks she herself didn\u2019t include on an invite list (NTA).", "No, I didn't go because she wasn't invited. Its odd because at no point prior did we ever feel nor did she show any indication that she had a problem with Jane.", "Yes. There was no response from her regarding this because all the other friends were invited.

And you can give your friends the same answer she gave: \u00ab\u00a0I think she understand\u00a0\u00bb.\nIf she was not willing to explain why your wife was not invited AND talked wedding preparation, then Sarah is not worth the effort. Maybe your wife doesn\u2019t like conflict, I understand perfectly, but she cannot let herself be manipulated this way.\nYou are right to protect her.\nAnd it\u2019s your event so your choice.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Sarah was very upset and complained to all our friends because she assumed we would understand (whatever that means) and let it go\" .. **Tell her you assumed she would understand and let it go.**", "Hold up. You met Sarah through your wife, Jane. So she and Sarah were friends first. But you were invited and your wife was specifically excluded? \n\nNTA, and good on you for standing up for your wife. What would be really petty is if you invite her husband, but not her. Let her taste the petty. \n\nBut seriously, Sarah is no friend to the two of you. Drop her.", "NTA.\n\nShe literally told your wife all her plans not just for the wedding itself, but the events leading up to it too... then nothing?\n\nIt isn't based on a single incident, it's multiple. Every conversation they had was an opportunity for Sarah to tell your wife that you both wasn't invited. There's nothing to be understood because from what you have written, there has been no explanation for your exclusion to understand. \n\nSarah is now learning that friendship is a two way street. If you exclude close friends from one of the biggest milestones in your life, you can't and shouldn't be expected to let it go and pretend the hurt didn't happen cos the shoe is now on the other foot.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds as if your wife has difficulty with confrontations. In normal healthy relationships, people can express their feelings and ASK about things. What kind of \"good froendship\" doesn't have that level of communication, acceptance and support? If my \"friend\" was constantly talking about their wedding plans and invited all our friends except me, I'd ask if my invitation was lost in transit. That would lead to a conversation where my friend would tell me they did not invite me and why, or refuse to respond to those questions from me. Either way, I would understand that this \"friend\" sees me as a lesser more distant acquaintance than I had believed. That WOULD change the relationship and my boundaries with that former friend.\n\nIt is normal and healthy to have boundaries- where you choose to devote your time, energy and resources- in all relationships. Close and trusted friends get more time, info and resources because those relationships are fulfilling and supportive foe you. More distant acquaintances get civil and friendly interaction when circumstances bring you together, but they aren't privy to details of your daily life nor an active presence in your day to day.\n\nSarah hurt your wife. She excluded her from an important event. She is not a close, caring or \"good\" friend. No one has \"the right\" to be invited to a social occasion, especially hosted by someone they have injured. Not inviting Sarah isn't \"punishing\" her for excluding your wife. It's a reflection of your more accurate understanding of the nature of Sarah's \"friendship.\"", "INFO\nWere you invited to the wedding?", "NTA\u2026 i mean, if Sarah had been like \u201cwe\u2019re only doing something with close family\u201d for whatever reason I would get it but sounds like she never provided a reason and the wedding wasn\u2019t small. \n\nSo she intentionally excluded your wife. Why wouldn\u2019t you return the favour?", "Imagine discussing your plans with your close friend and excluding them. Fuck her. My missus over anyone ever. Nta.", "TOTAL NTA after getting further info  \n\n\nOriginal post below, OP did give further info though.  \n\n\nVoting YTA the now but you could change my mind.\n\nYTA your doing it delibrately to hurt her, your doing it for revenge. We don't know why she did not include your wife at her wedding or what her reasons were, if you wanted to end the friendship there and then was the time to do it, instead you chose to pretend to forgive her and move on just so you could be petty at a later date, is this the new standard for your friendship. She hurt your wife by not inviting her to her wedding so now you hurt her by not inviting her to an even, so she can hurt you by not inviting you to the next event in her life and just continue like that, pretending to be friends when in reality your just trying to get revenge on each other for hurting one another.\n\nEither end the friendship outrite and move on or have a conversation about how hurt you and your wife were and then forgive and move on for the sake of the friendship its one of the other.", "You are either a good enough friend to want to share your highs and lows, share your happy occasions and and reserve them a spot at your table/home to share a meal and drinks. Or you are not.\n\nThe reason why you weren't invited wasn't disclosed so the assumption that you will understand is not given.\nYou took the lack of invitation at face value.\n\nAnd at face value you deducted that you are not regarded as friends who celebrates together.\nSo you followed her lead and did not extend her and invite.\nShe should understand.\n\nHer friendship with your wife is a more casual one on one friendship not a public gatherings social kind that you invest in financially hosting her.\n\nNta", "INFO: did you ever ask why you were invited to the wedding and not your wife even though you know Sarah because of her?", "NTA. Sarah didn\u2019t give you a plus one to her wedding.

I really should have invited them.", "Easy one. Nta. Stand up for your wife when she can't.", "The other thing that I may think of is some very strict religious thing. Like there are some religions where an outsider can\u2019t enter the temple/church - but then she probably could have been invited to the reception unless that\u2019s also in a religious building? Is her associating with people outside of her religion frowned upon as well? \n\nThat being said - I don\u2019t think that would be ok either. That would be some cult crap.\n\nAnd OP is NTA.", "It's worse than that \u2013 OP *was* invited to the wedding, his was, specifically, was not", "My wife can communicate and confront but in situations like this its fair to believe people like Sarah want to get a reaction out of her which she can never allow. So she chooses not to engage and slowly go low contact.", "Yes. I didn't go because she wasn't invited.", "Hurt who? You're making a lot of assumptions here. I didn't forgive her, as far as I'm concerned we're not friends anymore. She used to text my wife pretending all was good while Jane rarely responded. Yes I agree Jane should have communicated but she didn't want to and asked me not to so I respected her wishes. This is the only time where I outright went against what she wanted because I couldn't let it go.", "Just an addition from the update: OP was invited. Just not his wife. Odd.\n\nNTA anyway.", "Were you invited to the wedding?\n\nRegardless, NTA. Sarah speaking to your wife at length about her wedding and then not even inviting her is terrible", "Still confused.  Is your wife beautiful and Sarah is worried that she is not by comparison to your wife?  So your wife wasn\u2019t invited because she was too pretty?", "This needs to be added as an edit to your post. You are NTA. That\u2019s some weird stuff on its own.", "There you go. This woman isn't your friend. Why should you feel bad about not inviting someone who isn't your friend to your event?", "*\"Hurt who? You're making a lot of assumptions here. I didn't forgive her, as far as I'm concerned we're not friends anymore.\"*\n\nThank you for clarifying I did say you could change my mind and I am editing my post, NTA if she is not your friend then don't invite her, simple as that and have that conversation with your wife, its fine to say she does not want the confrontation or that but thats her choice and you can respect it, she should equaly respect your choice not to invite someone who is not a friend to a landmark event in your life.\n\nSucks to be you a bit rite now, your caught between respecting your wifes feelings about not wanting the confrtontation and standing up for your own feelings and against the clear disrespect that was done to your wife. I would say your doing a good job.", "I find her the most beautiful woman in the world but generally people do call her pretty. I don't think its that though because Sarah never indicated there was any problem. Its possible that Jane comes across as 'perfect' because she doesn't generally share her problems with anyone so people think her life is great but thats just my opinion.", "So, you don't know for sure why Jane was excluded and she doesn't feel comfortable finding out? I'm sticking with my judgment. \n\nHowever, if you want to maintain a friendship with Sarah, then I think a conversation needs to be had about what happened and why."]}
