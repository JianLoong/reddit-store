We've always had a great friendship and have been there for her when she was constantly bullied in college. My wife, Jane, has a close bond with Sarah over the years. We've spent countless evenings hanging out, celebrating birthdays, and even going on vacations together. \n\nHere's where the issue comes in. A while ago, Sarah got married. I was happy for her, of course, and I naturally assumed that my wife, Jane, would receive an invitation to the wedding. However, the invitation never arrived although she discussed her wedding preps with Jane for quite a long while along with the games and events she wanted to have in the build up to her wedding where all her friends would be included. Jane was really hurt by this, as she had always considered Sarah to be a close friend, and this omission seemed pretty odd. \n\nFast forward to now. I'm hosting a party to celebrate a milestone, and I'm putting together the guest list. When it came to inviting Sarah, I decided to exclude her from the list. Sarah claimed that she and Jane were close friends, yet Jane wasn't important enough to be invited to her wedding. I wanted to convey that her actions hurt Jane's feelings, and I wanted to stand up for my wife. Jane was initially hurt by this whole situation and wasn't sure if we should even remain friends with Sarah. However, she also felt a bit uneasy about me intentionally excluding Sarah from the party but I can be very petty when it comes to my wife. \n\nSarah was very upset and complained to all our friends because she assumed we would understand (whatever that means) and let it go which was really not a good enough excuse. Some of our mutual friends are divided on whether I'm in the right or the wrong. Some think it's a bit extreme to not invite her based on a single incident, while others agree that there's a principle at stake here \u2013 that if someone claims to be close, their actions should align with their words. Jane is not happy with me on this but she's not the type of person to confront anyone until absolutely necessary which annoys me because that means people tend to walk all over her.\n\nSo, AITA for not inviting Sarah to my party because she didn't invite my wife to her wedding despite claiming my wife is a close friend?

This is both very odd and very rude. Unless this was some five person pandemic wedding, but you say all her other friends were invited. If there was any legitimate reason, it was on Sarah to sit down and explain it to your wife. Excluding her in this way is generally a friendship ender. You are under no obligation to consider her a good friend, and include her in your guest list.", "NTA , you two weren\u2019t important enough to make the wedding list, then she clearly didn\u2019t want your presence on that day , she showed you how she felt. It was her wedding and she can invite the people she wants the same way you can invite the people you want to your party it\u2019s simple.", "No real reason given why she purposefully excluded your wife, her \u201cfriend\u201d. This should be friendship ending\u2026 or downgrade to acquaintance. And why should you work to maintain a one sided friendship, and include her in events when she doesn\u2019t feel similarly? She can invite whoever she wants to her wedding, and similarly you can invite who you want to your parties. NTA", "NTA - I mean what you did was definitely petty, but intentionally not inviting someone to your wedding is way more of a slap in the face than not inviting them to a simple event. Seems to me like maybe Sarah has been faking being friendly to your wife? Either way y\u2019all need to talk this out like adults.", ">Sarah was very upset and complained to all our friends because she assumed we would understand (whatever that means) and let it go which was really not a good enough excuse.\n\nInfo: Did Sarah give a reason why Jane wasn't invited?

If your wife isn't good enough to go to her wedding, then Sarah isn't good enough to come to the party. She has no right to complain.", "ESH - you pushed your wife into a confrontation she clearly didn't want. Sarah complaining to your friends over this is wildly hypocritical, if she thinks you both should \"understand\" not being invited to celebrate a milestone in her life with zero explanation then she should have the same understanding for herself in this situation.", "Yta. Not inviting someone and hoping they'll get your grudgy message in that action is childish. \nDid you ask at the time of the wedding why Jane wasn't invited?", "However shy she is.. your partner really needs to ask why she wasn't invited. Clarity is painful, but fog is like a snag that just keeps dragging at your mind", "Tell her you'd only be able to understand why your wife wasn't invited, if she actually explains why she wasn't invited. Their supposedly close friends, yet she wasn't invited and won't tell you why. Doesn't sound like a friendship to me.\nNTA", "Exactly, what are they supposed to \"understand\"", "I asked Jane to check it out but she didn't want to and she asked me not to either. One of the reasons why that is because she had a rough childhood where she has been consistently shamed on physical features she has no control over by people both close to her and afar. So she's kept walls around her and doesn't really show anyone that they have rattled her.", "I get English isn\u2019t OPs native tongue but that was my question as well \u2026\n\ndid OP go to the wedding??  It isn\u2019t clear at all.\n\nLike why weren\u2019t either of them at the wedding?  Sarah can\u2019t get pissy about not going to parties of folks she herself didn\u2019t include on an invite list (NTA).", "No, I didn't go because she wasn't invited. Its odd because at no point prior did we ever feel nor did she show any indication that she had a problem with Jane.", "Yes. There was no response from her regarding this because all the other friends were invited. I also explained to her exactly why I didn't invite but she is trying to make me look bad to our friends.", "Dude you won me with your statement \u201cI can get petty when it comes to my wife\u201d \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc4c that is how it should be sir \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. And you can give your friends the same answer she gave: \u00ab\u00a0I think she understand\u00a0\u00bb.\nIf she was not willing to explain why your wife was not invited AND talked wedding preparation, then Sarah is not worth the effort. Maybe your wife doesn\u2019t like conflict, I understand perfectly, but she cannot let herself be manipulated this way.\nYou are right to protect her.\nAnd it\u2019s your event so your choice."]}
