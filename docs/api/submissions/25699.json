She has no right to complain.", "ESH - you pushed your wife into a confrontation she clearly didn't want. Sarah complaining to your friends over this is wildly hypocritical, if she thinks you both should \"understand\" not being invited to celebrate a milestone in her life with zero explanation then she should have the same understanding for herself in this situation.", "Yta. Not inviting someone and hoping they'll get your grudgy message in that action is childish. \nDid you ask at the time of the wedding why Jane wasn't invited?", "However shy she is.. your partner really needs to ask why she wasn't invited.

It isn\u2019t clear at all.\n\nLike why weren\u2019t either of them at the wedding?

Its odd because at no point prior did we ever feel nor did she show any indication that she had a problem with Jane.", "Yes.

Drop her.", "NTA.\n\nShe literally told your wife all her plans not just for the wedding itself, but the events leading up to it too... then nothing?\n\nIt isn't based on a single incident, it's multiple. Every conversation they had was an opportunity for Sarah to tell your wife that you both wasn't invited. There's nothing to be understood because from what you have written, there has been no explanation for your exclusion to understand. \n\nSarah is now learning that friendship is a two way street. If you exclude close friends from one of the biggest milestones in your life, you can't and shouldn't be expected to let it go and pretend the hurt didn't happen cos the shoe is now on the other foot.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds as if your wife has difficulty with confrontations. In normal healthy relationships, people can express their feelings and ASK about things. What kind of \"good froendship\" doesn't have that level of communication, acceptance and support? If my \"friend\" was constantly talking about their wedding plans and invited all our friends except me, I'd ask if my invitation was lost in transit. That would lead to a conversation where my friend would tell me they did not invite me and why, or refuse to respond to those questions from me. Either way, I would understand that this \"friend\" sees me as a lesser more distant acquaintance than I had believed. That WOULD change the relationship and my boundaries with that former friend.\n\nIt is normal and healthy to have boundaries- where you choose to devote your time, energy and resources- in all relationships. Close and trusted friends get more time, info and resources because those relationships are fulfilling and supportive foe you. More distant acquaintances get civil and friendly interaction when circumstances bring you together, but they aren't privy to details of your daily life nor an active presence in your day to day.\n\nSarah hurt your wife. She excluded her from an important event. She is not a close, caring or \"good\" friend. No one has \"the right\" to be invited to a social occasion, especially hosted by someone they have injured. Not inviting Sarah isn't \"punishing\" her for excluding your wife. It's a reflection of your more accurate understanding of the nature of Sarah's \"friendship.\"", "INFO\nWere you invited to the wedding?", "NTA\u2026 i mean, if Sarah had been like \u201cwe\u2019re only doing something with close family\u201d for whatever reason I would get it but sounds like she never provided a reason and the wedding wasn\u2019t small. \n\nSo she intentionally excluded your wife.

We don't know why she did not include your wife at her wedding or what her reasons were, if you wanted to end the friendship there and then was the time to do it, instead you chose to pretend to forgive her and move on just so you could be petty at a later date, is this the new standard for your friendship. She hurt your wife by not inviting her to her wedding so now you hurt her by not inviting her to an even, so she can hurt you by not inviting you to the next event in her life and just continue like that, pretending to be friends when in reality your just trying to get revenge on each other for hurting one another.\n\nEither end the friendship outrite and move on or have a conversation about how hurt you and your wife were and then forgive and move on for the sake of the friendship its one of the other.", "You are either a good enough friend to want to share your highs and lows, share your happy occasions and and reserve them a spot at your table/home to share a meal and drinks.

I would say your doing a good job.", "I find her the most beautiful woman in the world but generally people do call her pretty. I don't think its that though because Sarah never indicated there was any problem. Its possible that Jane comes across as 'perfect' because she doesn't generally share her problems with anyone so people think her life is great but thats just my opinion.", "So, you don't know for sure why Jane was excluded and she doesn't feel comfortable finding out? I'm sticking with my judgment. \n\nHowever, if you want to maintain a friendship with Sarah, then I think a conversation needs to be had about what happened and why.", "NTA. Your friends need to get a clue. This 'single incident' they're talking about is her wedding, a presumably once in a lifetime event that she didn't feel the need to have Jane be a part of. Many a relationships have been broken over not inviting certain people to such an important event. On the other hand, any other event, even a milestone event, is really trivial in comparison to a Wedding, and she shouldn't be bothered about not being invited.", "There\u2019s got to be something drastic that happened for you to get an invite but not your wife, especially since she knew your wife first. \n\nWether it\u2019s something your wife said or did that Jane didn\u2019t agree with. Wether you will ever find out who knows\u2026", "INFO:  Are you 100% positive the invitation for Jane wasn\u2019t lost in the mail?\n\nI find it really odd that Sarah would talk to Jane about the wedding and invite you, but not invite Jane.

So Sarah is acting like the reason is already known and thus doesn't need to be explained.\n\nThe funny thing to me is the \"just let it go\" that Sarah threw in with it. That has an implicit acknowledgement that Jane has reason to be upset. But that Sarah wants it to be forgotten without having to do any work to repair the relationship.\n\nWhatever Sarah's reason for not inviting Jane was, her response to not getting invited herself suggests that she knows that it was probably pretty petty. She may even realize that choosing to still invite OP was also petty.", "Right? I\u2019m still so confused why they didn\u2019t ask why he was invited but not his wife?

This sub tells me how popular it is to have weddings without getting a +1. I think in my 30+ years of life i was once invited to wedding without it. I was 10 then.

Your a good husband and petty was warranted in this situation", "Wether it\u2019s something your wife said or did that Jane didn\u2019t agree with. Wether you will ever find out who knows\u2026", "Is it childish? Or is it matching the amount of effort being put into the friendship?\n\nTrue, OP and/or wife could have inquired why the wife wasn\u2019t invited, but the wife should not have been put in a situation like that to begin with.  If OP\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t going to make the guest list, the bride should not have brought up wedding planning with her to begin with.  That is incredibly rude and explicitly excluded OP\u2019s wife. \n\nIt\u2019s unreasonable when people expect invitations and effort in relationships that they don\u2019t reciprocate.  A friend of mine stopped inviting me to events/birthdays that other mutual friends were invited to.  I didn\u2019t question it and respected their decision (maybe they felt like we grew apart or didn\u2019t give as well anymore), but then they were upset when they didn\u2019t make my wedding guest list.  What do people expect???", "Right?! This is so strange to me. The husband gets invited but the best friend is deliberately left out? This would be the end of a friendship in my book.", "Were you invited and told that she was explicitly not invited?\n\nOr did you receive an invitation with the expectation of bringing her as your plus one?\n\nAsking because, sometimes, in my country it's customary to address the invitation to the man. In some of my mom's friends' weddings, the invitation read \"Mr [Dad's name] and family\".", "It's also rude to exclude half a married couple. OP should've skipped the wedding", "I mean, OP's wife wouldn't be a +1 if she's supposedly equally close with Sarah. She'd be a guest as well.", "if you\u2019re single, no +1. if you there\u2019s room at the end, give out select +1s. but sarah not inviting jane is fucked up and i wouldn\u2019t have reach out after either \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb so nta for excluding her.", "It\u2019s very normal to invite people who are not in a serious relationship without a +1. But yeah, if you know or have reason to believe someone is in a serious relationship you give them a +1. Same if the need a caretaker or any number of other potential things that need accommodation. You certainly don\u2019t invite one spouse and not the other.", "As i see it, if you invite a guest to your event - you want them to have fun and this means - they should decide if they want to have fun on their own or with partner of their choosing.\n\nI have been to weddings alone, with friends and with partner - even if i went stag, it was my choice, not something put on me by a host - but never until i reached this sub have i heard of not giving a +1 to someone as a standard practice. \n\nAnd if the guest is in committed relationship, they get invite without +1. They get an invite with two named guests.\n\nThis just seems very unwelcoming to me. I would consider myself a bad host if i couldnt accommodate my guests in such small manner.\n\nBut i thought of something. This kind of seems to me like this is just people being cheap and greedy. When you have a couple at your wedding, you get one gift. You get two if you invite two singles. So you get two gifts for the price of one at expense of someone\u2019s comfort.", "As i said. Not normal to me, been to weddings when i was single with friends as +1. If you invite someone in serious relationship, their partner isn\u2019t an unnamed +1 - they are clearly named on an invitation.", "That makes no sense. That means if you want 40 specific people at a wedding you need to plan for 80? That\u2019s nuts.", "Definitely NTA in this situation. Sarah decided to snub your wife and then expected people to understand. No Sarah needs to know her actions have consequences. And I sincerely hope that you and your wife cut Sarah out of your life.", "NTA\n\nHow can Sarah justify inviting you to her wedding but not your wife. Absolutely exclude her from your party.", "INFO: How big was the wedding?", "Nta you were invited and she wasn\u2019t?! What a dick", "NTA it\u2019s your event and you can invite whomever you want.\n\nAlso, YOU were invited to her wedding but your wife, who introduced you to Sarah, wasn\u2019t!?!?! That makes no sense at all - sounds like a case of missing reasons. Sadly I think it\u2019s time to downgrade Sarah from close friend to more casual acquaintance.", "NTA!!! Love your energy\u2026. If I am dating someone, heck I want him to be your level petty; because trust me, I would be if the roles were reversed\u2026. Kuddos on being an awesome hubby!", "NTA.\n\n\"*Oh, Sarah, we assumed you would understand. We have learned from you. Now why don't you learn from us? We accepted your decision and your right to invite or not invite guests as you please. Please accept our decision and our right to do the same.*\"", "NTA tell anyone who complains on Sarah's behalf that you don't understand why Sarah is upset, as she should understand why she isn't invited. Just like Sarah expected you and Jane to be \"understanding\". Friendship absolutely is reciprocal, otherwise it's just one party using the other. Like a parasite. \n\nP.S those individuals who believe you are petty are usually the ones who would go nuclear in your own shoes. Their level of self awareness is likely laughable \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah - OP is clearly NTA but I would be very interested in what exactly the reason is for snubbing the wife. I'm not sure there's an explanation that will make me go \"oh yeah, that makes sense\", but still.", "That\u2019s exactly what I thought!", "OP was invited but his wife excluded. And all of their friends invited. Obviously not a small family only wedding.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "OP, I didn\u2019t see gender listed in your post. Are you and your wife the same or opposite sex? Can you think of anything that may seem like a possible reason she would have for excluding your wife? It\u2019s so odd to me that she invited you and not your wife when you two met through your wife.\n\nI really hope it\u2019s not homophobia or racism, but whatever the reason, it was rude for her to exclude your wife who has been her friend for years. Good on you for not attending and for standing up for your wife.", "Exactly. Accordingly to what he said, actually, every reason could only make the situation worse and enforce the NTA", "I like your wife\u2019s moxie. The slow death is awesome. Although,  I\u2019m sure you want to go scorched earth and remind this \u201cfriend\u201d of how your wife stood by her side while she was being bullied in college and the other things your wife did for her. Obviously she\u2019s on that bullshit and when you\u2019re grown and have a thriving and successful and happy life of your own, ain\u2019t nobody got time for that. Congrats on your milestone and I wish you and your wife the very best.", "I\u2019m the same way as your wife, it just feels like wasted energy sometimes to me. If I don\u2019t see a productive conversation that will lead to change as the likely outcome, or if I\u2019m not interested in trying to fix it anymore, I just fade out and live my own life.\n\nSounds like your wife is trying to not focus on things that hurt and choosing to keep her energy for those who really matter.", "I would reach out directly and say \"I don't know how I'm expected to understand something that has never been explained to me. Can you please tell me why I was invited to your wedding but my wife \u2014 who introduced me to you \u2014 wasn't?\"\n\nIf there's no justifiable reason, then you haven't minsunderstood anything. Your wife was snubbed.\n\nNTA", "OP met her through his wife as well, so it makes even less sense to invite OP and not his wife!!!", "Ok, but how much time will you spend with those 40 people ? Lets say reception takes 8 hours; 8 hours divided by 40 is 12 minutes. You have 12 minutes to talk to each guest, given that you will not have first dance or father-daughter dance and eat dinner or do any wedding stuff. You have every minute accounted for that day and you have only 12 minutes for each guest. \n\nBut what are those guests supposed to do for the rest 7 hours and 48 minutes. Do you want them to leave early? Sit there the whole time and look at the wall?\n\nOr do you want to them to have fun?"]}
