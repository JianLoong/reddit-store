(she said she was 26/27). i was kind of in denial for a bit and didn't want to believe it until a few days later. we were in a car together and i saw her phone unlocked on a separate homescreen page that had tinder on it. i dont think she saw me look at her phone but when she saw that her phone was unlocked she quickly snatched it and turned it off. \nin 2020 or early 2021, she was going through a rough patch with her husband and they separated for a while, and were about to get divorced. i'm not sure if thats when she got it, but in her religion she is not supposed to be with any man for a few months after separating from her husband.
