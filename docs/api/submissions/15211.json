PPD sucks. And I have severe BD. But I will never expect someone cover up for my feelings. Christine needs therapy.", "NTA. Look, I\u2019m a mom who has given birth twice- once to a singleton, and once to twins. It didn\u2019t matter what your girlfriend wore, Christine was going to get upset with someone. It wasn\u2019t your girlfriend, it was the environment. Christine wasn\u2019t ready. \n\nAs long as your girlfriend didn\u2019t go out of her way and have the intention of upsetting Christine, there\u2019s no AH in this story.

Christine needs to see a therapist before she goes to parties if she feels that shitty about herself.", "NTA at all. I am going to say this as kindly, yet as honestly, as I can. Christine knew she was invited to a pool party. Pool parties are known for people wearing outfits which show their bodies. If she is still struggling with body dysmorphia, then she needs to avoid triggers until she is better, and that includes environments with people dressed in a certain way. She was invited to the party- it wasn't mandatory, she had the choice to sit this one out. It's not your girlfriend's job to hide her own body to spare someone else's feelings. Your friend needs more therapy.", "100% NTA. I have experienced PPD and I totally understand how it can manifest in any number of negative ways. You and your gf are not responsible for fixing or responding to these manifestations though and it sounds like you are understanding and compassionate to what Christine is going through.", "NTA.\n\nDid she ask every woman there to cover up?", "Why are you in this? You were the phone, you took the message and delivered it. \n\nNTA for anyone.", "NTA Christine knows she has a body issue that's her problem she should have stayed home", "NTA, nope.

You said that there were multiple other women wearing something similar, but your girlfriend is the only one that is the \"problem?\"", "NTA\n\nChristine has some issues she needs to address with a therapist.

I hope she seeks some treatment, because PPD is serious and she needs help.", "NTA at all. Your girlfriend doesn't need to adjust her own body in any way because of someone else's insecurities.

In the future, advocate for your wife right away and turn that comment down as inappropriate.", "NTA and it seems Christine uses her PPD to be an asshole and tries to bend the world to her will. She can go kick rocks.", "I sympathize for Christine, I really do. But we have to manage our own conditions, even if they're triggered by other people and situations that occur in public. Our control stops outside of our bodies.\n\nIn this case, you relayed Jane's request, and Alex considered it. Given the context of her surroundings, Alex decided she would not cover up. That was the end of the matter. Christine chose to leave early which is her right and is appropriate to do if she needed to leave a stressful situation.\n\nJane has no right to consider either you or Alex T A in this situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Everywhere you turn there can be someone who is \u201cperfect\u201d", "NTA that's ridiculous! Christine thinks she's the main character. I'm a heavier woman and I wouldn't dream of asking anyone to cover up because they looked too good. Wow.", "NTA it is not Alex's job to take care of Christine's feelings. I'm sorry she is going through it right now, but therapy would probably help.", "NTA. PPD is hard, but that doesn't give your friend the right to control what others wear.", "Nta", "I wish school was back in session", "NTA.

Christine needs to grow up a little bit", "INFO: Why do you think there\u2019s a difference between bikinis and swimsuits, tho? Bikinis are swimsuits.\n\nAlso I think it\u2019s a little odd that she left 2 hours later and it\u2019s because of the jealousy. She stayed for 2 hours. That\u2019s a *really* long time. This sounds like shenanigans to me.", "NAH. You were at a POOL party. Your gf is beautiful. In no way is she at \"fault\", nor is Christine. All Christine has to do is turn on a tv, pull up a screen of ANY kind, or open a mag and she'll be bombarded by \"perfection\". She can't expect people to change their looks or dress for her. Having said that, I truly hope she is getting the help she needs.", "NTA. \n\nChristine is responsible for managing her own emotions. While we can sympathize does not mean that others have or need to compensate or minimize themselves for her.", "The only thing I would add is that if I were in the same situation, I would not have spoke to my gf at all.

Would\u2019ve been N A H if they handing shamed you and Alex.\n\nSometimes, asking someone to do something unreasonable and makes the asker the asshole. Other times, the request is eminently reasonable and refusing makes one the asshole. This is in the middle.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been nice for Alex to cover up if she\u2019d wanted to after learning of Christine\u2019s anguish, but it\u2019s also quite reasonable for her want to remain in her swim suit at a pool party and act on that preference.  Deciding not to subjugate one\u2019s own existence to the needs of other adults does not make one an asshole.\n\nThe assholes here are Christine\u2019s friends. First, did Christine even want this request made. It\u2019s possible to be upset by something but not ask others to intercede. Second, it doesn\u2019t sound like they made any efforts to help beyond demanding Alex cover up. Could\u2019ve tried gathering inside, taken a short break from the party with Christine and then reassess, talk to you/Alex/host about timing of swimming vs other activities (e.g. we\u2019re going to serve dinner in 2 hours, should we all meet up again then when people aren\u2019t swimming etc.), or take one of the two hours Christine stayed to tactfully talk to host about a small group leaving earlier than expected and then making plans to go somewhere else with Christine that wouldn\u2019t be as triggering.", "In my opinion NTA. I can only imagine how hard it is to have PPD (I'm a guy, so I can't relate on a personal level), but what you describe about Christine sounds more like jealousy than body dysmorphia. I mean you mentioned that there were other women there in bikinis, so why didn't she single any of them out? Why only talk about your gf? Does that mean that any time she sees an attractive woman in public, she runs off crying? I doubt it. It comes across as plain jealousy of Alex as opposed any kind of mental health trigger. \n\nYou and your girlfriend aren't responsible for her feelings. Alex wasn't belittling or body shaming Christine. Christine on the other hand is acting like a jealous and insecure teenager. I'm sorry you and your gf had to deal with that, but the two of you didn't do anything wrong", "I guess NAH HERE. Except possibly you for saying your gf \u201cstole the show.\u201d Barf. It\u2019s a pool party amongst friends not a beauty pageant.", "NTA alexsaid no, you can\u2019t force your gf to do something and that\u2019s kinda shitty to make alex responsible for Christine\u2019s ppd.

Otherwise Y-T-A to her and her only.", "Is PPD on the rise? When me and my friends were having babies no one got it. NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. While your girlfriend could have covered up, honestly, it\u2019s as if she was being shamed for her body because of someone else\u2019s issues. And she isn\u2019t responsible for them.

Both body and mind are haywire after giving birth, if your lucky! But that\u2019s her problem, your girlfriend was dressed appropriately and should never be shamed for her body.

It's like when young girls who are more \"developed\" are reprimanded for wearing the same clothes as other girls - it makes you feel like your own body is a problem, even if that body fits conventional beauty standards. Bikinis clearly aren't the problem for Christine if other people are wearing them; Alex's body apparently is. \n\nIt's already not ok for Christine to ask someone to change their clothes for her comfort; it's doubly wrong to make Alex feel like her body is the problem.", "And even then at religious places it's pretty iffy because a lottttt of religious rules are towards covering women and forcing them to wear dresses/skirts as a reminder that the church believes they are the lesser/subservient sex. \n\n  \nI'm happy to cover my legs while visiting a church in Europe UNLESS they are also allowing men in the church with shorts on revealing their bare legs while chastising the women.", "Yeah Christine\u2019s a dumb btch it sounds like .", "I love that line \"my mental health issues aren't my fault, but they're my responsibility\" amazing, I hope it's ok to use it? Agree NTA", "We don\u2019t actually know if Christine made that request. That may have just been the fix-it friend\u2019s solution. Also OP is NTA.", "I like your last line. Nice.", "Yes, my life changed the day I realized that avoiding triggers is a symptom, not a treatment.", "Yeah I think bc having cptsd and recovering from it is very difficult, it makes us want to make the world one big safe space. Too, finally being able to express ourselves and verbalize our needs is huge. However, like you said, it doesn\u2019t entitle us to request or demand the world accommodate us.", "Yeah. You can\u2019t really control triggers. They can come from anywhere. You have to learn how to control your reactions.", "I love that quote! It\u2019s a good one.", "I don\u2019t know. I feel like this is a situation where she could easily anticipate that it might cause distress and she should have a plan in place. Like \u201chey, friends, this might be hard for me and I might leave early if I\u2019m not feeling comfortable\u201d I put a tiny, very gentle YTA on Christine because if she had truly thought this through or planned, she would have given herself more grace if she needed to leave early. And she would have thought through the potential triggering scenarios like women in bathing suits and made a plan while she was still thinking clearly. If you\u2019re not at this point in your recovery where you can make a plan to accommodate your mental health issue, you shouldn\u2019t attend", "Lol \ud83e\udd23\n\nThere are so many acronyms! lol \ud83d\ude02", "I mean. We don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. Some women bounce back pretty amazingly. But let\u2019s be honest, that requires fantastic genetics.", "Yeah. If the model wore a cover-up, she'd still be thin and beautiful. It wouldn't have helped.", "She shouldn\u2019t be around ppl then. If you\u2019re so crazy you single ppl out for your own issues.", "Maybe stick to the facts and don\u2019t project your own feelings here. There is absolutely nothing in OP\u2019s post from which you could reasonably infer that Christine \u201cfelt silly\u201dabout her behaviour.", "Ah, in that case I\u2019ll stick with my judgment and assume Jane was a being little too overprotective of Christine\u2019s feelings. I\u2019d suggest checking in with Christine as a friend, not in relation to the pool party incident, and see how she\u2019s doing.", "Maybe Jane is the one who actually had a problem with your gf and using Christine as a scapegoat. Cos if Christine was upset she wouldn\u2019t have stayed for 2 more hours, and if she was crying people would have noticed and said something. You should talk to Christine.", "I think the friend who was relaying this information to the boyfriend was probably way too much into everyone\u2019s business and made a mountain out of a molehill.", "I mean shes not *necessarily* wrong but this is also hilarious", "I wish you would! Bodies aging and changing after birth is natural, and it makes me so sad that it's seen as something to fear when you're young and something to hide when you're older. I think more representation would lead to more confidence and a healthier body image, especially in women. \n\nIf your body type was normalized and accepted, maybe Christine wouldn't have body dysmorphia. Maybe most people wouldn't. \n\nSo subject us! Subject the world!", "I am 57 and I hate that older women are shamed for their bodies. It's not gross for our bodies to age. You aren't subjecting anyone to your body because there is nothing disgusting about getting older. Big hugs to you.", "Also agree. Part of therapy is owning that particularly when you have the insight to do so.", "I wish it was my quote. It's from Marcus Parks from Last Podcast on the Left. I've got a sticker of it on my water bottle", "Hail yourself, friend.", "Hail yourself.", "I've had CPTSD since I was a child.  If something bothers me I simply move on.  There are no cotton candy wrappers that are going to make everything better.  I was a victim of SA at the age of 3, and yes I remember it.", "Christine didn't say anything to OP or Alex, so I'm not sure she's the asshole either.", "My mom was one of them. I also call her a genetic freak. She bounced right back with zero issues", "I got a tummy tuck... it's great.", "Yeah. Unless She had a CS, her body is permanently altered.", "Sending Jane over to call them ahs seem a little malicious.", "Christine might have made an off handed comment about feeling bad about her body and Jane exaggerated it. I have known people like Jane and usually they are shit stirrers just trying to cause drama.", "Exactly. If she actually has PP body dysmorphia, stay away from pool parties.", "The person you are replying to said in their last sentence that they may not have felt silly. You may have miased that part, so I thought I'd clarify!", "If aging and birth-changed bodies, or just a variety of bodies, were more normalized when I was growing up, my self-esteem about my body wouldn\u2019t have been annihilated when I was 9. That was when I started wearing baggy clothes and holding shirts out in front of me so they wouldn\u2019t cling to my stomach, especially if I was outside and it was windy. I\u2019m 38 and to this day I haven\u2019t owned or worn a pair of shorts. I wear pants to cover my legs always - even if it\u2019s 110\u00b0 outside. I went through multiple long periods of time over the years where I wouldn\u2019t leave the house because I thought I wasn\u2019t skinny enough. \n\nBeauty standards for women absolutely fucked me up and I don\u2019t know any women who weren\u2019t negatively impacted by them at some point.", "Megustalations", "Megustalations!", "No. *Pregnancy* changes a body long term and a CS is major abdominal surgery", "The scar will be hidden under a regular much less a high waist bikini. It\u2019s not like they are skinny dipping! \n\nAlso plenty of people have surgery and have scars. A scar doesn\u2019t \u201cruin your body\u201d unless you choose to fixate on it.", "She might not have. Jane might just have noticed Christine being upset and thought she was helping.", "Would also explain her hanging around another two hours. Trying to get others to join her cause", "Try again. The person I was responding to said \u201c\u2026 it\u2019s likely than [sic] Christine felt pretty silly\u2026\u201d. The \u201cor maybe not\u201d doesn\u2019t nullify the prior statement.", "Hail Gein.", "Hail ME!"]}
