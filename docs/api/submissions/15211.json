Look, I\u2019m a mom who has given birth twice- once to a singleton, and once to twins. It didn\u2019t matter what your girlfriend wore, Christine was going to get upset with someone. It wasn\u2019t your girlfriend, it was the environment. Christine wasn\u2019t ready. \n\nAs long as your girlfriend didn\u2019t go out of her way and have the intention of upsetting Christine, there\u2019s no AH in this story.

Christine needs to see a therapist before she goes to parties if she feels that shitty about herself.", "NTA at all. I am going to say this as kindly, yet as honestly, as I can. Christine knew she was invited to a pool party. Pool parties are known for people wearing outfits which show their bodies. If she is still struggling with body dysmorphia, then she needs to avoid triggers until she is better, and that includes environments with people dressed in a certain way. She was invited to the party- it wasn't mandatory, she had the choice to sit this one out. It's not your girlfriend's job to hide her own body to spare someone else's feelings. Your friend needs more therapy.", "100% NTA. I have experienced PPD and I totally understand how it can manifest in any number of negative ways. You and your gf are not responsible for fixing or responding to these manifestations though and it sounds like you are understanding and compassionate to what Christine is going through.", "NTA.\n\nDid she ask every woman there to cover up?", "Why are you in this? You were the phone, you took the message and delivered it. \n\nNTA for anyone.", "NTA Christine knows she has a body issue that's her problem she should have stayed home", "NTA, nope.

You said that there were multiple other women wearing something similar, but your girlfriend is the only one that is the \"problem?\"", "NTA\n\nChristine has some issues she needs to address with a therapist.

I hope she seeks some treatment, because PPD is serious and she needs help.", "NTA at all. Your girlfriend doesn't need to adjust her own body in any way because of someone else's insecurities. Christine is responsible for managing her own triggers. She doesn't get to make it someone else's problem.", "NTA. If Christine has body dysmorphia, she needs therapy, but what you have described sounds more like jealously than legit body dysmorphia.", "Absolutely NTA. In the future, advocate for your wife right away and turn that comment down as inappropriate.", "NTA and it seems Christine uses her PPD to be an asshole and tries to bend the world to her will. She can go kick rocks.", "I sympathize for Christine, I really do. But we have to manage our own conditions, even if they're triggered by other people and situations that occur in public. Our control stops outside of our bodies.\n\nIn this case, you relayed Jane's request, and Alex considered it. Given the context of her surroundings, Alex decided she would not cover up. That was the end of the matter. Christine chose to leave early which is her right and is appropriate to do if she needed to leave a stressful situation.\n\nJane has no right to consider either you or Alex T A in this situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Everywhere you turn there can be someone who is \u201cperfect\u201d", "NTA that's ridiculous! Christine thinks she's the main character. I'm a heavier woman and I wouldn't dream of asking anyone to cover up because they looked too good. Wow.", "NTA it is not Alex's job to take care of Christine's feelings. I'm sorry she is going through it right now, but therapy would probably help.", "NTA. PPD is hard, but that doesn't give your friend the right to control what others wear.", "Nta", "I wish school was back in session", "NTA.

Christine needs to grow up a little bit", "INFO: Why do you think there\u2019s a difference between bikinis and swimsuits, tho? Bikinis are swimsuits.\n\nAlso I think it\u2019s a little odd that she left 2 hours later and it\u2019s because of the jealousy. She stayed for 2 hours. That\u2019s a *really* long time. This sounds like shenanigans to me.", "NAH. You were at a POOL party. Your gf is beautiful. In no way is she at \"fault\", nor is Christine. All Christine has to do is turn on a tv, pull up a screen of ANY kind, or open a mag and she'll be bombarded by \"perfection\". She can't expect people to change their looks or dress for her. Having said that, I truly hope she is getting the help she needs.", "NTA. \n\nChristine is responsible for managing her own emotions. While we can sympathize does not mean that others have or need to compensate or minimize themselves for her.", "The only thing I would add is that if I were in the same situation, I would not have spoke to my gf at all.

Would\u2019ve been N A H if they handing shamed you and Alex.\n\nSometimes, asking someone to do something unreasonable and makes the asker the asshole. Other times, the request is eminently reasonable and refusing makes one the asshole. This is in the middle.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been nice for Alex to cover up if she\u2019d wanted to after learning of Christine\u2019s anguish, but it\u2019s also quite reasonable for her want to remain in her swim suit at a pool party and act on that preference.  Deciding not to subjugate one\u2019s own existence to the needs of other adults does not make one an asshole.\n\nThe assholes here are Christine\u2019s friends. First, did Christine even want this request made. It\u2019s possible to be upset by something but not ask others to intercede. Second, it doesn\u2019t sound like they made any efforts to help beyond demanding Alex cover up. Could\u2019ve tried gathering inside, taken a short break from the party with Christine and then reassess, talk to you/Alex/host about timing of swimming vs other activities (e.g. we\u2019re going to serve dinner in 2 hours, should we all meet up again then when people aren\u2019t swimming etc.), or take one of the two hours Christine stayed to tactfully talk to host about a small group leaving earlier than expected and then making plans to go somewhere else with Christine that wouldn\u2019t be as triggering.", "In my opinion NTA. I can only imagine how hard it is to have PPD (I'm a guy, so I can't relate on a personal level), but what you describe about Christine sounds more like jealousy than body dysmorphia. I mean you mentioned that there were other women there in bikinis, so why didn't she single any of them out? Why only talk about your gf? Does that mean that any time she sees an attractive woman in public, she runs off crying? I doubt it. It comes across as plain jealousy of Alex as opposed any kind of mental health trigger. \n\nYou and your girlfriend aren't responsible for her feelings. Alex wasn't belittling or body shaming Christine. Christine on the other hand is acting like a jealous and insecure teenager. I'm sorry you and your gf had to deal with that, but the two of you didn't do anything wrong", "I guess NAH HERE. Except possibly you for saying your gf \u201cstole the show.\u201d Barf. It\u2019s a pool party amongst friends not a beauty pageant.", "NTA alexsaid no, you can\u2019t force your gf to do something and that\u2019s kinda shitty to make alex responsible for Christine\u2019s ppd. Christine should be the one figure out what she can and cannot do", "INFO Did Christine say anything to you, or seem upset, or was it just Jane's interpretation of how things were?", "So long as you handled this gently with Alex, you\u2019re NTA.  Otherwise Y-T-A to her and her only.", "Is PPD on the rise? When me and my friends were having babies no one got it. NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. While your girlfriend could have covered up, honestly, it\u2019s as if she was being shamed for her body because of someone else\u2019s issues. And she isn\u2019t responsible for them.

Both body and mind are haywire after giving birth, if your lucky! But that\u2019s her problem, your girlfriend was dressed appropriately and should never be shamed for her body.
