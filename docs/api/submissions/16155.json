He has died halfway across the country, but my real father is alive, and my mother has always known where he was. \n\nI immediately get back into therapy, but it's been a true battle.

It probably feels incredibly like him so you are going to have to find some peace and common ground. \n\nYWNBTA to discuss with him, but Y W B T A if you don't accept the outcome he chooses.", "NTA as long as you let your son know that there is trauma associated with the name. But you should talk to your therapist regarding how much to reveal as your son is already carrying a big emotional load with his transition.", "hmmmm this is a tough one but I'm going to say NAH, but I wouldn't frame the conversation in a way of saying you want him to change his name, but rather than you respect his choice in his name but that you wanted to make him aware of the trauma you have associated with it and let him come to that decision on his own if he decides to change it, and if he doesn't well as you said it is a rather common name so unless you want to have your trauma re-triggered everytime you meet anyone named \"john\" you may just want to work on adjusting to it and disassociating the trauma from the name since it is so generic.", "NTA, but do talk to him first about what the name means to him.  He may not be open to the name change.  You don't know unless you have an open and honest conversation with him.", "NAH. He doesnt know. If its that common a name,he probably just likes it. Its understandable to have trauma associated with that name. You need to talk to him,however you should accept what he decides as its his name. YWBTA if you just tell him to change it with no explanation.", "I feel like you should make a distinction here. YWNBTA if you told your son the whole story and how his chosen name makes you feel. And yes, that first introduction would probably have been a difficult moment to tell him, since it's a sensitive and momentous situation for him. But you shouldn't wait for long either since choosing a new name isn't done lightly.\n\nYou should however be aware that YWBTA if you tried to *force* him to change his name. Yes, this name is a sensitive one for you, but as I said: It's probably a sensitive topic for him as well and you should be aware of it when you talk to him.\n\nWhat I think you don't have is the option to not talk to him at all... this is obviously a traumatic issue for you and there's simply no way you can keep this a secret from your son forever. It could influence your relationship. You might wanna prepare to work through this issue though if he has really grown so attached to the name that he doesn't wanna change it anymore.", "NTA \n\nThe execution is what might swing this either way. Tell your kid EVERYTHING. Dont just say you knew a bad guy by that name. Be honest. The bad guy is your son's.... Uncle?  I don't think he'd want to be linked to that name if he knew details.\n\nYou're not invalidating your trans child. You just have deeply personal issues with the particular name chosen, for very valid reasons.", "You're NAH. As someone who changed their name without 100% support from my mom you need to have an open conversation with him. Explain why it bothers you, maybe give other options, and let him explain why he picked it and what it means to him.", "NTA\nYou should talk with your son and explain as much as you are comfortable with. But you should let him decide, since it is his choice. As long as you don't force him to do anything, you're nta", "NTA\n\nSit down and explain the situation as honestly as possible.  He may be open to it, he may not.  Is there a chance he picked that name because he wanted a 'family name' without knowing about the abuse?  If so, he may be thankful you explained it so he can pick a different name.", "NAH. You were hurt, and grief is hard. It can be difficult to associate a name that causes you dread with someone you love. \n\nBut I would gently argue, that it isn\u2019t your business what name your son feels fits him. It may be difficult at first, and you may feel sadness for awhile while you adjust to hearing and saying the name over and over, but I think you will get used to it fairly quickly. \n\nThanks for supporting your son, even though this is causing you pain. I know your heartbreak isn\u2019t about your son being trans, but a lot of parents feel grief when their trans kids change names.", "I think you need to explain to your son what happened before you ask him to change it.\n\nOtherwise, if you approach/ask without an explanation, it may come off as being unsupportive. \n\nHowever, if he still wants to use the name after the explanation then you'll need to be supportive even if you're uncomfortable.\n\n\nNAH.", "NAH. He doesn't know, so I suppose he picked the name because he likes it. YWBTA if you ask him to change it without explaining why tho.\n\nHe's 15, old enough to understand things. So tell him you're not comfortable with that name and explain why. You did it for strangers on Reddit, so I'm sure you can do it for your son. Then let him decide if he want to change his name or not, and accept his decision. But you shouldn't keep it for yourself. It will only eat you alive and hurt your relationship with your son.", "I'm sorry. NAH obviously. You can indeed sit down with him and tell you that story and  why the name bothers you and then let him decide if he wants to keep it.", "NTA. I get it is the name he chose but if every time you think of your kid or hear that name you are gonna associate it with bad memories. Talk to your kid and let him know. If he wants the name still so be it", "YWNBTA. Tell him before he gets attached to the new name.", "NTA, for just letting him know how you feel. It us important because if this name has a negative attachment and at any point you break down over the trauma of the name he may associate it not with your own trauma but with you being upset over the transition. \n\nI would sit him down and let him know you support him 100% but this is the situation with his chosen name and he is welcome to keep it but you want him to know any negative emotions you experience about the name are nothing to do with him but with your step father who has that name. \n\nAs a mom we are are expected to shove our feelings down for our family, but I know the young generation today doesn\u2019t feel that way. I bet your son will be happy for you to tell him instead of bottling it up and growing resentment. Just watch how you approach the conversation!", "NTA - but definitely talk to him.  Explain to him that you are still thrilled he is transitioning into what they need to be, but explain why that name is so traumatic.", "NTA  But I don't think you should ask anyway.  Not every John is your \"father.\"\n\n\u201cWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose/by any other name would smell as sweet.\u201d  \n\n\nWhen Juliet says this to Romeo, she means that a name is just an thing that people use to identify people and things, a name by itself has no actual worth or meaning. The meanings or feelings that we associate with a name evolve out of our feelings of the person it belongs to, not the other way around.  Just like the feelings you assign to the name now because of the bad father, they will evolve again with the new owner. Once he takes that name, your son will become his own version of \"John,\" and you won't see the face of the father everytime you hear or say it, you will see your son.", "NtAH - but you will want to talk to him.  He may or may not change it.  It may have special meaning to him since he picked it.  I know the name may be painful, but it may be important to him.  The only way you are gonna know is if you sit down and talk to him.", "on the one hand, 100% nah. your feelings can be easily understood. on the other hand, it's just a name, which, moreover, is still your son's choice, not yours. you better be prepared for the fact that he has the right to refuse to change it", "NAH. I think you need to be transparent about the situation, but leave it to your son to choose whether or not to change his name. He deserves to know the full history of it, but it he may have had very specific reasons for choosing it- and whatever choice is made should be his alone.", "I'm not sure to be honest. But you can explain everything and say how that name makes you feel. And  ask if it is a possibility for him to change it. Make it super super clear that it's his decision and if he decides that he can do that for you. And it might be nice if you helped him pick one. I really have no idea if what I said is a good idea or not so please don't bash me. I guess I will find out soon enough lol. Anyway I hope it goes well for you both", "YWBTA\n\nChoosing a name can be a very intense and personal decision for a trans child, and by the time they're willing to share it publicly, a long time of thought has usually been put into that. Our name is such a fundamental part of ourselves, and it should be something we alone determine.\n\nYour trauma and past are valid, so you are NTA for thinking about this, but your son's personal identity should not be secondary to these struggles.", "NAH - yet\n\nYour feelings are totally valid and understandable.

Especially if you are going to have any sort of visible reaction to hearing the name spoken frequently. Just keep in mind that he may have been thinking about and mentally trying out names in his head for awhile, so it may be difficult for him to think of something else. He may not want to think of something else. But I think it is important for both of you for you to have this conversation with him. \n\nIn general I think it is important for parents to be honest with their kids about their struggles with their mental health and how they are managing it because it models a good example of acceptance and getting help when you need it. I think it is particularly important in this case because if your son sees you struggling, he may assume it is because of him.", "YWNBTA, but this could be a good opportunity for you to bring new associations to that name.\n\nA lot of trans people have trauma around their deadnames, and one way to help overcome that trauma is to re-associate it. A good example would br naming your pokemon your deadname, so instead of thinking of yourself you think of your little pixel guy.\n\nSo this could be an opportunity for you to hear John, and not think of the man who hurt you, but the man your son will become.\n\nObviously you're free to talk to him about it! But just in case you wanted more options, especially depending on how attached he is to the name (it isn't uncommon to try more than one name).\n\nGood luck to you and your new son!", "Trans person who has changed their name here. First of all, thank you for being a good and affirming parent. Many parents act like total AHs about their trans kids in general, let alone a complex situation like this. So...you are NTA for thinking of this/posting about it, but there are a couple outcomes:\n\n1. YW**N**BTA if you figured out an age-appropriate way of explaining the name situation to your son. DO NOT make him responsible for your emotions and history around the name by crying or getting mad or carrying on about the name. Simply tell him about the situation in a factual way, then leave it to him to ponder. Do not offer \"alternative names.\" Remind him that you understand how this name is meaningful to him and you're not going to force him to decide on a new name or to change it altogether, that it's his decision if he wants to. You will be supportive of him doing what's right for him. At 15, it would be reasonable to expect that he'd take your feelings into account, but *not* that he would make an adult-level, other-oriented decision around something this imporant.\n2. YW**N**BTA if, after telling your son about the issue, he decided not to change it and that felt hard. This then becomes an issue for you to work through with your therapists/peers, with special consideration to watch your behaviour around your son, i.e. not avoiding using his name or being weird about it. This is hard but it's not your son's fault that \"John\" was awful to you. There is an opportunity, over time, to reframe your association with that name.\n3. Y**W**BTA if you ended up treating your son differently/avoiding his name but didn't tell him about the name history. He would probably end up really confused and assuming it was about him being trans. Not good.\n4. Y**W**BTA if, after having shared an appropriate explanation with your son re: the name, and he still chose not to change it, you acted like a AH toward him, secretly (or overtly) blamed him for not changing it, or otherwise made him hold your feelings and traumatic history about John. Trans or not, it's not a child's responsibility to hold their parent's feelings.   \nThis name could be very important to him or it might not be. I changed my name twice when I was a young trans person. Some of my trans friends are VERY tied to their chosen names. It's a crap shoot. I wish you and your son luck. You sound like you're an excellent parent.", "I would totally accept the outcome but I do feel like atleast trying would be worth it. Luckily he kept his middle name which I love but I'm not sure how he feels going by that as well since we've never used it much before.", "It's also possible the son chose the name *for OP*, because he thought it would cushion the blow of him coming out and essentially rejecting the name his mom had chosen for him. After all, it doesn't sound like he had a  relationship with his maternal grandfather even before this, so it's unlikely he's doing it to honor a beloved mentor. Maybe he just likes the name but there's a good chance he chose it to honor his mom, not to hurt her.", "I will talk to my therapist and his. Since he came out he's begun seeing a therapist who is also trans and knows how to navigate these things. Thank you", "He's never met him so that isn't why. I did add on another comment that he chose that name because someone accidentally called him by a name that is close to his dead name and thought it was funny. Like if his name was June someone called him John Travolta and thought it was the best story so he thought it'd be perfect.", "This was my initial thought. I know how much time and I'm sure stress could go into choosing a new name which is why I am very torn. I do know that he chose the name because someone accidentally called him by \"John\" which (before he came out) would be close to his real name and he thought it was funny and a cool story \ud83d\ude04. Not to undermine his choice, just something I thought I'd add", "I would walk through this conversation with your therapist before you approach your son.", "I also think this is important to do because otherwise he might think your reaction is to him and not the name itself. Definitely important to talk this over even just as a \u201cI support you but want you to know that my reaction is in no way to do with you, but instead had to do with past trauma of my own\u201d", "How public has he made the name? You say he recently came out to you, is he out in most places in life? Like, if he just told you, his therapist, and maybe his closest friend, that's one thing. If he's made social media posts and told all his teachers to start calling him by his new name, etc, that's another. \n\n\nI still think NAH for all the reasons everyone has said, but it does make a difference. He would be asked about the change. It makes it something you should do sooner, rather than later.", "OOOHHH gotcha.  He still may be open to a change if you explain the reasons.  I think as long as you don't come off as demanding you'll be fine.", "I really don't envy the spot you're in, but I'm just very glad you're approaching it with care and thoughtfulness. Just be supportive and loving, whatever you decide. That's what counts.", "NTA.\nSit him down and do your \u201ccoming out to him\u201d.\n\nExplain him that you love him more than anything.\nBut explain him about your past as an abused child. Who did this to you and what he was called. Just tell him it triggers you although it isn\u2019t his fault (your son).\n\nHe\u2019d rather offer to get a different name or perhaps, help you bring a positive connotation to this name?\n\nAnyway. I hope you\u2019ll be alright with the help of your therapist. But if you opened up to your husband and son, they\u2019ll probably support you and help you walk out of the nightmare from the past.", "I think if you tell him a general reason that it would be hard for you, he would probably want to choose a different name. I'm pretty sure no kid with loving parents will want to put their mom through that. Just make it clear that this is only about your association with that name, nothing else. NTA", "NAH, but only as long as you communicate honestly with him, and are ready that he may not want to change.", "NTA\n\nIt is a very delicate conversation, for sure. Just be honest about your history with the name. I personally feel that he should at least know about the situation,  because if the name is a trigger for you, he will eventually pick up on that and might interpret it as you not being supportive of him. Just be really clear that you're not judging him in any way...it's simply that the name is associated with a dark piece of your history and it hurts to hear/use that name (and, I presume, hurts even more to associate it with someone who you love very much).\n\nFinal thought: my son is trans, and he also transitioned through names, so to speak (not sure exactly how common this is, but it does happen). He chose a first and middle name, changed the middle, and ended up finally choosing a completely different first name and went with a shortened version of the other first name for his middle name (if any of that made sense, lol). And you can share this with your son, if it's relevant...but please don't use it to put pressure on him. Ultimately, it is his decision. But you sound very supportive, so I think he will hear you and want to be sensitive to you, as well.\n\nMuch love to both of you! Transitioning is a difficult process, but it is also an incredibly beautiful process. From my perspective, it was like watching a flower begin to blossom when he was young...then wilt during the years before coming out...and then exploding into full bloom, more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.", "NTA under two conditions:\n\n1. You fully disclose every last detail about your problem with the name John. No leaving anything out \"to protect him.\" Tell him EVERYTHING.\n2. You accept his final decision after he has all the information, and never bring it up to him again.", "Would it be possible for you to discuss it with his therapist too? Maybe it would even be possible for his therapist to mediate, when you to have the conversation with your son. I just think his therapist is likely to be in the best position to advise you on how to present what you have to say. \n\nAs someone else mentioned, I think your son will probably pick up on your discomfort, and you don't want him to misconstrue it and think that you have a problem with him being trans.\n\nUPDATED TO ADD: Sorry, don't know how I missed that you said you would be talking to his therapist too. Maybe I'm even more tired than I realized...", "she said \u201cand his\u201d", "Good heavens. You're right, she absolutely did.", "If you ask your son to change his name, you will have to explain why.\n\nTell him.\n\nNAH", "Not without warning, though, or making sure he's in the right headspace to hear about your trauma. He may be already quite tired emotionally from I assume coming out to many people or being anxious about people's reactions.", "What a great mom you are.  Before acting you went to therapy immediately.", "Could you share with him what you would you have named him if you knew he was a boy at birth?", "I can\u2019t really give a judgment.\n\nBut what I will say is that maybe your son will ultimately feel like John does not fit him. I know a few people who have changed their name because ultimately as a progress than develop throughout the transition, they realize the initial name they chose, didn\u2019t feel right.\n\nI would suggest letting this play out and settle its course. \n\nI would also like to respectfully remind you when you named your child when they were born, that child did not have a say in what they were named. I think now that your child is choosing to name themselves, you should also respect the name they have chosen, just like they respected The name you gave them. \n\nI think if you\u2019re not going around demanding every other John in the world changes his name because of your trauma, why do you feel like you can treat your child any differently. I think you really should challenge yourself on why you feel \u201centitled\u201d or I have the \u201cright\u201d to ask this of your child. You don\u2019t ask this of anyone else in the world, so why your child specifically?", "YWBTA", "YTA. What would you do if you met a stranger with that name? Ask that you call them something different?", "Please check with your therapist and have a chat with your son! I think he's likely to listen to your perspective and a second name change isn't out of the realm of possibility. My trans cousin went through a couple names as a young teenager before settling on one."]}
