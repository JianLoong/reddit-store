I've had girls randomly grab my muscles, grab my crotch, kiss me, slap my ass, put my hands on their bodies, all sorts of fucked up stuff. \n\nIt genuinely has caused me distress well after the fact- your fiance was being sexually harassed and you are not the asshole for telling her to fuck off in no uncertain terms. \n\nYou did the right thing, I remember once I had to fight some ladies brother for pushing her off of me when she was aggressively trying to kiss my neck, ended up having to go to court over the fight.  \n\nDrunk girls are fucked up man.", "NTA\n\nYou're never wrong for stepping in on, and stopping, sexual harassment.

Not to mention, if the roles were reversed and it was a male doing something similar to a female, then it would be sexual harassment.

She was just trying to be nice\n\nShe isn't actually being nice if the offer isn't sincere.\n\n>you slut shamed her\n\nA fair critique but lets be specific here.\n\nSlut shaming is normally shaming a person for behaving in a way that is perceived as overly sexual, such as wearing revealing clothes. It is shaming someone for violating norms of sexual decency.\n\nWhat the OP was critiquing was not the girl being sexual in general, rather it was the girl sexually harassing the OP's fiance.\n\n>your fianc\u00e9 can handle himself\n\nYeah, but that doesn't mean he won't appreciate some support. When you help a loved one it isn't necessarily because they can't help themself. Sometimes you just want to make their life a bit easier.\n\nI think it is good that the OP had her fiance's back.", "Nah man, ive apologized for my friends before, it's a normal thing to do. You kind of are responsible for your friends when you're getting intoxicated, that's like drug etiquette 101. You watch out for and keep the peace with your inebriated fellows.\n\nSecond, who gives a fuck about someone cussing someone out when the person you're cussing out is sexually assaulting someone.\n\nThird, defending a victim especially when the genders of the situation create a weird power imbalance is like a good thing to do.\n\nIf someone is being grabby with a girl would you say pushing the guy off is an asshole move?\n\nShe didn't start swinging or anything, but creating distance is both called for and acceptable.", "I didn't do or say anything to her relative, only the drunk girl. For the record, it was the sober relative who bought me a drink- not the drunk one.", ">if the roles were reversed\n\nNo need to reverse the roles. It *is* sexual harassment. Everyone in this thread seems to agree on that.", "This right here. She knew exactly what she was doing.", "I wish", "One does not have to be sincere in order to be nice.  People say nice things all the time that are insincere. When ending a date, someone might say  it was \u201cnice meeting them,\u201d when it was anything but. Similar niceties are uttered when someone prepares a dish that isn\u2019t enjoyable or has a hairstyle that doesn\u2019t look very good.  But in this case, it was a gesture to try to be apologetic and defuse the situation. \n\nIn any case, OP didn\u2019t need to accept a drink, because it wasn\u2019t the cousin who did anything to her or her boyfriend.\n\nIt\u2019s still slut shaming and inappropriate.  It\u2019s using a slur for unacceptable behavior to describe acceptable behavior. It\u2019s like calling someone a homophobic slur because they stole your parking spot. \n\nSexual harassment is highly inappropriate; but that has nothing to do with a person who is being wrongly shamed for being \u201coverly sexual.\u201c\n\nAsk for your final point: it\u2019s great to support one\u2019s partner in uncomfortable situations; but the OP was inappropriate because she used violence. As such, she should\u2019ve just let the boyfriend handle it.", "Nah man, I never said there was anything wrong with apologizing; it\u2019s just a gesture. I said the cousin wasn\u2019t responsible for the drunk girl.  If your drunk friend does something stupid and gets arrested, are you volunteering to go to jail too?\n\nAsk for your last point: I think it\u2019s appropriate to step in and defend someone who can defend themselves, which wasn\u2019t the case with the boyfriend.  Like I said, he can take care of himself.", "That\u2019s my point. She had no reason to buy you a drink; she\u2019s not responsible for her drunk relative.", ">People say nice things all the time that are insincere\n\nMakes me think of *Into the Woods*.\n\nPersonally if nice=lying then I would prefer if everyone stopped worrying about being nice. I want to be around people who are kind and honest, not people who lie just to be \"nice\".\n\nAt the end of the day I am not a mind reader, and neither is the OP. Neither are you for that manner. None of us can know what the person was thinking.\n\nFor me I think the best way to respect other people's autonomy is to assume they are being honest about themself. Their stated preference is my best bet for understanding their actual preference.", "> because she used violence.\n\nIf lightly pushing someone off is violence, then the girl prying the guy's arms, pushing herself onto him, and grabbing his face is also violence and most likely assault, yes?", ">If your drunk friend does something stupid and gets arrested, are you volunteering to go to jail too?\n\nThat makes zero sense. If you want to use that analogy, it should be offering to bail them out.  If your drunk friend does something stupid and gets arrested, and you offer to bail the friend out, the police won't say \"no, I won't accept that because you're not responsible for what your friend did\". The person who offers chose to offer (out of obligation or not), and the receiving end is not obligated to say no to the offer.", "She offered it as an apology on her drunk relatives behalf - but that's literally not the point and irrelevant.", "\nYour personal preferences for the kind of people you want to be around., are not relevant to this conversation. \n\nBy the way, a person can be both kind and untruthful. You\u2019re conflating the two concepts, as you previously did with \u201cnice\u201d and \u201csincere.\u201d\n\nWhile I don\u2019t know for certain what the cousin was thinking, it\u2019s a reasonable supposition that she offered the drink out of obligation, due to her cousin\u2019s egregious behavior.   \n\nI\u2019m not from a culturally backward-countr yand I\u2019m aware that people often make gestures in order to maintain a pleasant atmosphere rather than out of a sincere desire to carry them out.\n\nIf anything, the OP should have offered the drink to her boyfriend, since he was the injured party.   \n\nBut declining a drink from a complete stranger on the behalf of another adult, who did something to yet a third person, in no way, undermines the respect for anyone\u2019s autonomy.", "I\u2019ll take the brevity this reply as a concession to all of the other points I made.", "It makes perfect sense. You said that you have apologized for your friends before, and then immediately followed that up with the claim that you\u2019re responsible for your friends when they are drunk.  \n\nAs such, you should suffer the consequences of their behavior, since you allowed it. That is the logical progression of your argument. \n\nThe concept of bailing a friend out of jail is completely separate from that. That is something that any friend would potentially do for another, regardless of their involvement, or lack there of, with the behavior that landing the friend in jail.", "But you should not have accepted it, because because she didn\u2019t do anything. If the drunk girl herself had offered to buy the drink; then that would be very different.", "This is the stupidest complaint. You can't act like OP was taking advantage of someone when that person made the offer. That's ridiculous.", "Nope. People offer stuff out of obligation all of the time. Doesn\u2019t mean one needs to always accept. She was probably embarrassed and humiliated by her friends, irresponsible behavior and THAT\u2019S why she offered the drink. \n\nLooks like you\u2019re letting your emotions get the better of you  :)", "> People offer stuff out of obligation all of the time.\n\nYes, that's true.\n\n>Doesn\u2019t mean one needs to always accept.\n\nThat's also true. Key word: does mean one **needs** to accept. OP didn't have to accept, but why shouldn't she? The relative is not responsible for the girl's behavior, but as long as the relative offered, OP can accept the offer. OP isn't an AH because she accepted something that she was offered by someone.", "I already explained it."]}
