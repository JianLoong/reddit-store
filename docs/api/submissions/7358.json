You sound petty and spiteful.", "NTA. \n\nMost of the comments here so far have clearly never dealt with co-parenting, child support, custody, courts etc. \n\nNone of the questions people are asking matter. \n\nWhen you\u2019re a parent, you\u2019re required to provide for your child. The COURT determines the child support amount and it\u2019s almost always determined 100% by a calculator. There are very specific guidelines about how CS is calculated. It\u2019s not up to OP or the ex to decide. They couldn\u2019t \u201cjust agree\u201d even if they wanted to. They\u2019d have to (at bare minimum) submit a request to the court to reduce CS and sign a form together both agreeing that they\u2019re willingly deviating from the calculator. Even then some judges would deny it. \n\nAnd most jurisdictions will hold a parent to their \u201cearning potential\u201d not necessarily what they\u2019re currently earning. If a parent chooses to take a lower paying job, they\u2019re almost always required to continue calculating CS based on what they\u2019re CAPABLE of earning, unless there was a really good reason they made that choice. That\u2019s not the case here. She chose to leave for no real reason. My ex husband did the same thing once and the court gave him 2 months of SLIGHTLY reduced CS but then still had to continue paying based on what he was earning before he quit. The judge said 2 months was enough time for him to get himself back to his earning potential. My ex made the job change due to moving and also going back to school full time to earn a degree, and still the court basically said \u201ctoo bad so sad. You made kids and have proven you\u2019re easily capable of earning X, your ex shouldn\u2019t have to pick up your slack\u201d \n\nAnyway - NTA. If she wants to modify CS, she can file a motion. She doesn\u2019t even need a lawyer. It\u2019s super simple to do a CS modification and costs almost nothing (just a filing fee and maybe 30 min of lost wages if you have to go to a hearing). It\u2019s not your responsibility to do this for her. She chose to change jobs, she got herself into the situation she\u2019s in now financially, so she can do the work to modify if she thinks it\u2019s appropriate.

None of this seems like it was intentional. \n\nAre people supposed to stay stuck in careers they don\u2019t like forever because of ex\u2019s like OP!?", "Yeah, I don\u2019t know where I stand here. At best it is E S H imo. \n\nI don\u2019t think it is crazy that he would be upset that his ex, who his son relies on, decided to quit a stable and well paying job, then make herself effectively unemployable. I think there is a solid argument that *that* already kills the \u201clet\u2019s keep things amicable\u201d vibe. At least. I can tell you it would be messy if my wife or I just decided to quit our jobs on a lark and jeopardize our children\u2019s standard of living. I think it is fair to treat parents like they have a responsibility to their kids, and she has decided to diminish that. I think it\u2019s a stretch to call that \u201ckeeping it amicable,\u201d and put all the onus on him for wanting to fight her on it.\n\nWe agree that ultimately it is up to the courts, but at least from what I\u2019ve read, she seems atrociously irresponsible. I can\u2019t imagine making decisions like that with kids still at home.", "You sound like someone who has never had a mortgage nor a budget. Reduced child support means he could lose the house, or have to choose between feeding his child and paying the mortgage, etc. I could go on, but I can\u2019t accept this isn\u2019t obvious to you. He is working and providing for his family as he always has; she decided to quit her job and put the son\u2019s standard of living at risk. It isn\u2019t that complicated. Saying it is HIS mortgage in all caps doesn\u2019t change any of that - so I\u2019m not really sure what you are getting at. Yes, it is HIS mortgage that is paid with HIS income from CS for HIS son\u2019s needs. So what\u2019s your point?", "You realize this comment has no bearing on what I said, right? He can both mention how the cs supports his son\u2019s QOL and want to punish his ex for threatening that QOL. I was specifically responding to the claim \u201che hasn\u2019t mentioned how it will affect his son\u2019s standard of living *at all*\u201d \u2014 but he did in the original post.", "I would like to see a source on that claim. Do you have one?\n\nBecause if your claim were true, it would mean that every person ever who has left a high-paying for legitimate reasons (stress, harassment, etc) would be severely indebted to their co-parent. \n\nWhat seems far more likely is that some parents make it obvious that they're quitting their job for the sole purpose of having to pay less money. Or it becomes clear that they're making money off the books that can't be counted toward their income.", "\"It's very well known\"? Stop getting your factoids off the internet.\n\nFamily courts only refuse to take reduced income into account when they think a person is hiding assets or deliberately working well below their earning potential to stick it to the ex. Otherwise most state guidelines are clear that child support is based on the incomes of the parents and their respective responsibilities for the kid.\n\nHere, they apparently have 50-50 custody, but she was paying 2/3rds the care, and OP was getting enough excess that he was using it to pay his mortgage. A father in this situation, especially one hadn't previously been in arrears, wouldn't be expected to shell out $1000 a month while unemployed, either.", "Oh, he can try.  It\u2019s just going to be a 100% failure.\n\nFor the initial divorce, I agree, you often need a lawyer.  But child support adjustment is a simple, routine process that takes very little work.", "Word of advice: in AITA when you make ignorant statements alongside nastily sarcastic comments about other people, especially who are making calm, rational (and, in this case, correct) remarks, you look like an AH.\n\nCourts will waive court costs for indigent filers and having no income usually qualifies.\n\nMaybe you should rethink your plans to stick it to your ex, because this punitive attitude will make the court side against you.", "That\u2019s just not true. Maybe if they side w u but that\u2019s highly unlikely", "But she is paying child support. As much as she can afford. Where do you and OP expect her to get the extra money from? How would the courts force her to pay more than she can afford?", "She wants to punish her child for her bad career choice", "That has zero to do with a mortgage being a valid use of CS.", "The court will be looking at whether the decisions were made in bad faith, not whether they were good decisions or not", "You obviously don't know how this works.", "Thats not how it works from a legal standpoint. The courts will work under the assumption that she can get a similarly paying job until she gets a job.", "Do you say the same for fathers with 50/50 custody?", "Moral is one thing, legal is another. He's not obliged to accommodate her stupid mistakes.", "Bullshit. Whoever makes more ends up paying - mom or dad. It\u2019s not a moral issue it\u2019s a legal issue and about providing the best care for your child(ren.)", "So, parents can just choose to quit their jobs and stop paying rent and utilities and buying shoes and school supplies and all that stuff? Everybody is allowed to make that decision, even if it's both parents at the same time?", "Exactly this\u2026immediately no when OP said her job was \u201creally easy\u201d okay so if it\u2019s really easy why didn\u2019t YOU get the position.", "She wouldn't get a reduction in NYS under these circumstances. Dunno if it's different where op is.", "My point is that punishing his ex for making less than she was isn't going to affect his childs life unless he allows it too. He can't be very good at budgeting if his ex's life changes will drastically affect his own. If he is having to rely on his apparently unreliable wife to pay a mortgage, then he shouldn't have a mortgage.", "See, I think there's a 90% chance the court sides with him and doesn't issue a support reduction. She knew about her obligations BEFORE she quit two jobs. That's a her problem. \n\nI'm 99+% confident that a court would not award fee- shifting.  The facts support his position, but hers is nowhere near outlandish enough to be considered frivolous. Frivolous would be like, she bought a pet elephant and its food bills mean she can't afford to pay.", "Where do they expect fathers to get it from. The courts don't care. If the order is for her to pay $1000, and she doesn't, the arrears pile up no matter what. Pay it now, or pay it later with extra fees and the potential jail time. It is what it is.", "But she\u2019s not. Get help", "I'm replying to someone who mentioned various kid expenses as if OP is paying for those alone.", "In my experience, the courts side with the parent who has lost income, regardless of their idiotic behavior.", "If she got a lower paying job due to wanting a change and not being able to afford current child support payments that is paying for his mortgage. The court will side with her as it isn\u2019t in malice and he is actively trying to punish her over it because he doesn\u2019t like her choices", "Lmao where are you getting these stats from? It's not illegal to quit a job.", "That seems anecdotal.", "It's not illegal, but it is expensive if you're dealing with family court.", "Why? Cause you don't like how that sounds?", "I don't really care how it sounds? If you have a link to a study that supports your point that \"the courts don't care\" I'd be happy to read it.", "There is this nifty thing called GOOGLE. There is also a thing called a CELLPHONE. Between the 2 of those things you have access to the sum of all human knowledge. It's not my job or place to educate you. If you're interested enough, you can find out."]}
