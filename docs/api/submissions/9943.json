Real sorry man. My English ain't very good. So I might have missed that. And hey 3 months is enough for a wedding ya know. But eh sorry", "His boyfriend. Op is male", "I think their point is OP is an AH for not responding by breaking up with the bf. Intending to continue exposing your 1 year old to this person is harmful", "If someone tells you \"I'm afraid of dogs\", are you then going to send them pictures of dogs? \n\nNobody should ever send people pictures they don't want. No matter how much they themselves like what is in the picture. \n\nSure don't date someone with a child if you don't like children. Unless you talk to your partner who has a child and tell them about your boundaries, and you find a way to make the relationship work. But you will have to be way more op front than the boyfriend have been here. \nNot every relationship have to lead to moving in, getting married and having children.  \n\nA relationship even with someone who has a child can be casual and just dating and not getting involved in everyday life of your partner. \n\nThe boyfriend is 20 yo, and probably did not  plan this to be ting, where he would have to be involved with the child as he has made it clear that he do not like children.", "Unless it\u2019s a typo, OP is also a male. If that\u2019s true, sounds like jealousy.", "Yes, it makes sense. Still it seems life has been on fast track.", "Thats cool", "Without her introducing him to her child.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t think most 20yo\u2019s are thinking about \u201cforever\u201d after dating someone a short period of time.", "That isn't at all what they were saying, they said OP is the AH for sending him pics\n\nI do agree that it's harmful, but I don't think it makes OP the ah yet, if he continues to date him then I'd be more willing to say he's an ah", "I don't think he's genuinely afraid of the kid. He's just saying he doesn't like the kid, hence why he insults the kid instead of saying \"I'm actually scared of your child\".\n\nIt is fully on him for getting into a relationship with someone who openly has a child who is 1. It's impossible for the relationship to work out, especially when the child is 1 and he is okay with verbally abusing him.\n\nI still do not understand how OP is the AH in this situation", "I completely missed that, thank you for correcting!", "1. Idk how many women feel comfortable enough to let their baby meet a man on or after a first date. Or even for awhile but i guarantee she told him about the child. \n2. What are you on bro. The entire point of a relationship is because you want this person if your life. If you\u2019re hopping into relationships just for fun and then leaving when its not it wasnt even a relationship. Just f buddies or friends w benefits whatever", "Because OP is pushing his child on someone who is clearly not interested in a relationship with the child. \n\nOP has not started if he is the full time parent, or if a mother or other farther is involved. We don't know if the boyfriend could have reason to believe, that he did not need to be involved with the child. And OP clearly wants his boyfriend to be involved. They need to talk about that. And as I stated OP should really consider if he i willing to have a relationship with a boyfriend who don't want to be involved with the child.", ">Because OP is pushing his child on someone who is clearly not interested in a relationship with the child. \n\nWhich is inevitable. OP has a 1 year old child, the relationship will not work out at all if his boyfriend doesn't like kids to the extent of verbally abusing them. It's very much on the boyfriend to explicitly state \"I do not want to talk about your child or see your child, even in photo format\".\n\nAnd still, bf should've broken up as soon as he found out OP has a child. It will not work out.\n\nSince bf won't, and decides to verbally abuse a child instead, OP needs to.\n\nI still don't see how OP is the AH. I could only agree if OP sees all these verdicts, and decides to continue dating him.", ">Which is inevitable. OP has a 1 year old child, the relationship will not work out at all if his boyfriend doesn't like kids\n\nWell I disagree. A relationship with someone who has a child does not have to involve the child. Especially if the child is living somewhere else some of the time. \n\nThis relationship does however aplenty due to OPs actions have to involve the child. And OP should be upfront about that and not just send pictures when his boyfriend dont want that. \nThey should talk about the issue, and OPs boyfriend should make his boundaries clear and not act mean about the child. \n\nAnd yes they should definitely break up if OP needs a boyfriend who wants to be involved with his child."]}
