But once I move out, I have no intentions whatsoever on practicing a religion. A few days ago, A and I started talking about marriage. I understand some of you will think that I am too young but I don\u2019t want anything temporary. I don\u2019t want to be with somebody for a couple years and then move on because we have different views as to what we want. I asked A to give me a timeline of when he plans to start settling down to see if this is something that I also want. The more we got into the conversation the more questions were being asked. This is where he asked when was I planning to convert to a Muslim. I was extremely confused at first, because because i\u2019ve never really stated I wanted to convert I was just open to the religion. I wanted to know more about A\u2019s religion and culture. But he told me he just assumed because of how much I love the Islamic holidays and events I go to with him. This is true, but I only go for the food and because I know it makes him happy when he sees me getting along with his family and friends.  When I told him how I felt about not wanting to convert he got upset with me which I understand but at the same time it\u2019s my life and I choose what I get to do. He told me that he wouldn\u2019t really be considered a true Muslim man or whatever that means because his wife isn\u2019t Muslim. A said that he wanted to get married in a mosque and in order for that to happen I would need to be Muslim. A also said that it would be hard to raise kids in an inter-faith relationship which I don\u2019t think is true. I do think it\u2019s possible because my cousin is Jewish and her husband is Catholic. And they manage just fine with the two kids they have.  He called me an asshole for making him assume I would convert but again, I never really stated that I would. I do understand where he\u2019s coming from and his point of you but I think he should also understand mine and my reasons as to why I\u2019m not open with the idea of becoming a Muslim. I did get my cousins opinion and she does agree with him because she says that I knew what I was getting myself into when I started dating him three years ago.

For someone like U, who seems to be open and to care about freedom of the mind, he seems not to be a good partner. \n\nHe probably gets a lot of pressure from his family, who eventually do care for certain rules more than him being  happy? He could also be a very unconfident young man, who is hiding behind rules, thinking more about things like status than personal happiness? If his family is making pressure, U can be sure, they will make pressure on  U to become pregnant after the wedding. \n\nAs far as I know, it's not important  for U to change Your religion to marry a muslim. Your kids have to become muslim, if U go by the rules - and the man is the one who desides everything. Some muslim wedding don't need a bride in the mosque anyway  - but your father should be available. The divorce is complicated.

It\u2019s normal and healthy for people to grow and change so so much in their young 20s. Those changes might make you a very different person who wants different things than you do right now. As someone who is now 24f dating the same man for 5 years and wanted to get married at 20 - DON\u2019T.

You get married to this dude, it's gonna be temporary.", "NTA and I disagree with your cousin. You didn't \"know what you were getting into\" because that's not what normal people assume when they start dating. You don't just ASSUME that your SO is going to convert religions for you. It's also wrong for him to decide this. Religion is something you need to feel and commit to, you should do it because you believe in it. Not just because he says so.", "NAH but you picked the two most difficult religions for marriage, especially because you as the woman carry the Jewish line and the man carries the Muslim line. And while you down play it, it sounds like it is actually an issue for him. Unfortunately it's just not going to work.", "Crotch conversions are the worst.", "NTA. As a muslim myself, I'm telling you that he's in the wrong. Forcing someone to convert to Islam is prohibited, and inter-faith marriages are allowed without the partner having to convert. \nYou need to reconsider this relationship OP, because if he's like this now, how do you think he'll be after you get married? Also, in Islam, the children of an inter-faith marriage have to be raised according to the father's religion, which is Islam since inter-faith marriages are only allowed between a muslim man and a woman of another religion. Muslim women can't marry outside of Islam. So, knowing this, would you be okay with your kids being raised as muslims? Would your family be accepting of it, or will it create endless tension? This sounds like too much hassle for it to be a lifelong commitment. Please reconsider.", "I think NAH, but this is clearly something you two need to discuss more seriously about. You're still just in early talks of marriage, so you have plenty of time to fully talk about this, but you both need to know that marriage and converting are not light choices, so be thorough. I also understand not wanting to do things half way, but trust me, things can majorly change within the next few years. You're not done changing and growing because you're over 18.", "NAH don\u2019t convert if you don\u2019t want to. Why doesn\u2019t he consider converting to Judaism? Why must you be the one to lose a part of yourself? Love takes a lot of sacrifices but it doesn\u2019t have to come from 1 side only.", "NTA but he is. As far as I know, Muslims aren\u2019t even allowed to date. They are allowed to have \u201ccourtships\u201d which are basically family-supervised dates, then are expected to marry. What a double standard. He expects you to follow his religion when he isn\u2019t even doing it properly? And Muslim men are allowed to marry Jewish women, so his argument of not being considered a real Muslim man because you\u2019re Jewish is actually completely fake.", "Why would you convert ?? To be oppressed? \nMove on now, stay in your own world. We only have one go at life. It is hard enough anyway without additional obstacles.\nGood luck.", "NTA but he is for assuming you would convert. He didn't even ask you. To me that doesn't sound like he sees you as his equal. I see no future.", "NTA.\n\n1. For the record, a Muslim man can marry a non-Muslim woman. I believe there\u2019s a strong assertion that the kids will be Muslim though.\n\n2.

This is a key moment when you find out that your plans for the future are different.

He first asked her to convert just as a formality in order to please his parents and she agreed. She told us all it would just be informal and nothing would change. Within a year she\u2019s scarfed up, he wakes her to pray five times a day even if she had a sleepless night with her newborn, controls and picks out everything they own including household furniture and her clothes that are suddenly non-feminine and baggy. Seriously, it\u2019s a ploy.", "It's called reverting. You're already Muslim, we all are, we just don't know it. \n\nHonestly not the arsehole though. Forced faith is meaningless and if its that important to him he should find someone willing and stop waging love jihad on the chosen ones.", "Muslims have absolutely no tolerance or respect for other religions, and it would be sacrilege to trade in the faith of the chosen for such a proposition as \"I wouldn't be respected if I marry you for who you are.\" If this is there stance, that you remain an infidel until being pressured into converting to a religion that defends honor killings as a matter of course, then you will always be on the unsafe side of the power dynamic he's aiming to build. It is time to walk away, and YWBTA if you capitulate with his demands. The very thought makes my stomach churn; it is he who is unworthy of you, dear one. Be safe, and please remember how sacred it is to be a Jewish woman in this world, especially less than a century after the Shoah, for it is through the matrilineal line that the faith continues.

Even if you go through the process, you won't really be converting if you don't believe in it, so it would be starting the whole marriage with a lie.\n\nBesides, mixed religious households can and do work, even if you were planning on remaining Jewish.

It's best to have boundaries and ideals put out in the beginning, respectfully of both parties, otherwise situations like this arise.\n\nI hope you guys can work through it if you want to, or that you guys find your respective partners and have a healthy relationship later on down the line.", "NTA but move on.

Move on.", "No. You're NTA.\n\nYou've discovered that you and your bf are incompatible. He never asked how you felt and you never asked how he felt. Now you both know. His views aren't likely to change.\n\nDo you wish to be under a religious thumb for the next 60-70 years? Unable to make your own decisions and run your own life? Are you willing to sacrifice your self, your thoughts, your dreams, your freedom? \n\nThe particular religion doesn't matter, the rules for the major ones all dictate a woman's place as below a man. Unequal. \n\nI think you know what you have to do to prevent this future.", "NTA. This is a non negotiable item. It\u2019s time to end this relationship. Good luck, and I\u2019m sorry for the pain that you will experience.", "NAH, just not compatible and this will end your relationship. At least you two are having this conversation now and not after an engagement. Asking my religion and views was brought up by my now husband before he even asked me on a date. I found out later that religion was a dealbreaker for him and he wouldn\u2019t date a woman who wasn\u2019t Christian.", "Nope, you definitely shouldn't have to change who you are to be with someone. Take a step back and check with him, because it's really important to clear up what your (and his) values and background and whatever other important talks need to happen before you marry someone :)", "Honestly, it depends on what country you are in.

Isk why he's making a big deal about this", "NTA, and it was absolutely ridiculous for him to assume that you would be interested in becoming a Muslim. That needed to be a question that he asked and clarified with you early on.\n\nI do think him getting upset is a little ridiculous all things considering, but at the end of the day, you two are incompatible.

Because that is also an option, unless of course, he's T A H", "NTA but you both are kind of AH's for letting the relationship go this long with both of you assuming something super important about the other.\n\nThere is no future here. This is an insurmountable hurdle akin to one person wanting kids and the other not. It should have come up way earlier but I suppose since you're both still very young, religious conversion wasn't exactly on your minds when you were 17.", "NAH. It's a compatibility issue. He wouldn't be considered not a Muslim for marrying a Jew but his practicing or lack thereof might be a reason(he's ok with dating for three years and still debating marriage, not really something pressing Muslim would say is ok) but regardless, if your conversion is super important to him then I don't think you two should stay together.\n\nEither it'll be a point of issues between you later on if you don't convert or if you do convert he'll more than likely cherry pick which island elements he really requires you to follow based on his culture and not on his belief which will grow resentment between you guys. Never convert for SOMEONE ELSE. Only do it if it's your decision for YOU.", "I married a Muslim man.  In a mosque.  I am not Muslim and had no desire to convert.  This was not a problem for anybody.  The only issue was that the officiant at the mosque did say that the children would be considered Muslim and that it would be my husband's job to instruct them in Islam (which he never ended up doing and the kids are largely agnostic/atheist).  Hubby was never super observant and has recently told me that he sees himself as an atheist.\n\nThe only thing was, I remember my FIL saying that we had to tell the people at the mosque that I was Christian (I am not) because my first name is a fairly common Jewish name, and if I'd been Jewish, I would have needed some kind of dispensation or permission from the rabbi.  If I'm remembering that right.  I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI would say that you not being Muslim is not the dealbreaker that your boyfriend is making it out to be--BUT I would also tell you to have all this stuff figured out AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE, because if he honestly thinks he's not a real man if he doesn't marry a Muslim girl, that's concerning.  The fact that he just assumed you'd convert, that's concerning.  The fact that he believes it would be hard to raise kids is just ridiculous, and the fact that he seems to be using that as a way to convince you to convert, that's concerning.\n\nI also seem to remember FIL telling me that Muslims weren't huge on trying to convert others to Islam... but then again, that was over 20 years ago.  Things may have changed.  Also, there could be a cultural difference between Egypt and wherever your bf's family hails from.\n\nBut DEFINITELY get this all figured out before your relationship goes any further.  Don't just assume it will all work out.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA and move on. I myself am not a fan of organized religion, and if you have no intention of practicing one or raising children in a strict religious home give that relationship a hard pass.", "I\u2019ll tell it to u right now. DONT CONVERT!!! This is a horrible religion we\u2019re talking about. Sex slavery and slavery are allowed in Islam, women can be hit by their husbands according to Islam, women are half the intelligence of men in Islam, women who refuse to have intercourse just because they aren\u2019t in the mood get cursed all night by the angels until the husband is content with her, and much more horrible stuff. It also tries to creep into every aspect of daily life (how to eat, what to eat, what hand should be used for wiping, how to have coitus, etc). If u wanna know more, DM me or go to r/exmuslim", "Not the asshole and end the relationship now. My brother in law was in this predicament after a three year relationship. It ended when he was still undecided whether to convert or not.

Don't be a loser who does that.\n\nSo you are right to be forward with this, and don't br afraid of it ending the relationship, because if it does end it needed to end.", "NTA and I want to tell you as a Muslim do not convert just for marriage if you have to convert to Islam do it because you\u2019re a believer in this faith", "Nta.  I love that you are having this conversation because it\u2019s going to save you both from spending time in a relationship when it ultimately will go nowhere.    Even if you don\u2019t convert, he may insist his children be raised Muslim so make sure you are ok with that before making a lifetime commitment.", "NTA but also, get out now! He will not change his views. It's going to be a lifetime of arguing and unhappiness. I think you're just very naive at this age.", "NTA. Would be NAH except your BF is being the AH in this situation by getting so angry about something (a very big something) that was never discussed and he just assumed you'd do. You're gonna really have to think about this relationship tho, there's a handful of True dealbreakers in a relationship and religion is a big one. Ditto with kids and political opinions, and if you get this religion thing sorted you gotta start talking about that stuff now too.", "NAH. \n\nAs for him saying you're the AH for him assuming, there's that cute little phrase about assumptions. \n\nYou guys likely just aren't compatible, so this is a great stepping off point.", "Nta. My father is Muslim and my mother is Christian.  In my family we say we are both and modern Muslim. Where we live there are no mosqus so we practice the principles of Islam not the praying 5 times a day. You can make it work. Not converting is ok it can work.

Do not marry him", "NTA\n\nBut he is if he expects you to convert and gets angry that you don\u2019t want to.\nYou can\u2019t force people to believe.", "NAH - but you're both of a faith that has pretty specific rules and boundaries about dating outside the faith. You're not compatible. Sorry", "Nope. NTA. Fortunately for you both, you\u2019re young. You have time to see whether something like this will have an influence on your relationship going forward or not. \n\nFrom experience, I told my Muslim ex that I would not convert. He was fine with it. To the point that he never introduced me to his family, ever. And to the point that he cheated on me the entire time we dated with a Muslim girl whom he married 7 months after we broke up. Well, \u201cbroke up\u201d. Idk if I can even consider the two years I spent with him a relationship because he excluded me out of every part of what is considered a relationship. You must wonder why I even stuck around for 2 years of my life. It\u2019s simple. I was young. I met him when I was 19 and he was 21-22. I thought it was perfect. Things gradually started to shift for me. He never told me the truth, I couldn\u2019t see through his lies. I was naive and hopelessly invested into something that wasn\u2019t real. He was very toxic. Accused me of cheating many times when it was him the entire time. He went as far as keeping my name as his now wife\u2019s name in his phone just to keep me from his family. \n\nI don\u2019t want to leave this here to discourage you over your relationship. But being where I am now, in the best relationship I\u2019ve ever been in and knowing what love is supposed to be like, I never would have let myself go through that. I did consider converting, but I am glad that I eventually woke up to smell the flowers one day.", "NTA. Your boyfriend made some big assumptions and we know what happens to people who do that. He never asked you and enjoying his holidays doesn\u2019t mean a thing. I\u2019ve been to Jewish holiday gatherings and had a great time. Never felt a need to convert. \nYour cousin is wrong too. You were 16 when you starting dating this boy. 19 is a great time to have a DTR talk as you\u2019re both becoming adults. No one has any right to be mad.", "NAH- however, three years of being together and not discussing the big topics in that time like religion, money, children, and family dynamics that can be instant deal breakers and relationship killers means you are not ready.", "No judgment posted but fyi according to Islamic law a man can marry a woman from any of the Abrahamic religions (Islam, Judaism and Christianity).

It\u2019s not super different than Judaism except the different way of praying and holidays, the lifestyle I would say it\u2019s similar, but you shouldn\u2019t convert to a religion for someone. (As someone who was super religious like 8-9 years ago ,i would recommend you to read about the religion or Quran -with explanations- if you want to try to make the relationship work, don\u2019t get into it blindsided.)\n    I wish you both good luck, maybe one side can compromise without building resentment.", "You don\u2019t want something temporary but you\u2019ve been together for 3 years and this is just now coming up?", "That relationship is not going anywhere", "NTA. You were foolish for even dating him. This was never ever gonna work out unless he left the religion. Dump him. You are completely incompatible.

He is head of the Sudanese community here and they are all happy for him too. They had to marry to live together so did a tradition marriage a few months back then we had a combined muslim/catholic reception earlier this month. Seeing the joining of cultures like that was beautiful and they a deliriously happy together. \nTBH, sounds like your boyfriend really only wants a Muslim woman and will never propose unless you convert.

It is good that the conversation is already happening so he is aware.", "NTA\n\nBreakup. You're fundamentally incompatible.\n\nAnd if you get married, he will force you to convert, or bad things will happen.

I'm surprised his family even welcomes you, tbh.", "The two of you are not compatible. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s the truth. Please save yourself the drama and heartache of marrying the wrong person and at such a young age. I don\u2019t like flings either, but marrying the wrong person is way worse. Y\u2019all need to break up ASAP.", "NTA, you both really need to consider this incompatibility over religion before you get married. You have a right to not want to choose to practice a religion, and he shouldn\u2019t pressure you to convert, because that would be selfish of him. He also has the right to only want a Muslim wife who is fully devoted to the faith and will raise his children up in Islam. Maybe one or both of your viewpoints will change in the future and religion won\u2019t be something that\u2019s such a big deal, and you two can compromise, but neither of you should force yourselves to compromise on something that is really that important to you. Someone\u2019s religious belief is a huge part of their life, community, thought process, etc. If you force yourself to go along with it now to make him happy, you will find yourself stripped of your identity and unhappy in the future.

Converting for anyone is a big decision and he should never have assumed you would. That\u2019s on him. \n\nAnd given his attitude about this and him blaming you vs. taking accountability, I think this is a red flag to any future with him. Something this important to verify should have been on him, yet he\u2019s blaming you. How often does he do that? If this is how he seems to operate then you should rethink this relationship.", "NTA. Maybe if he wants to assume his wife is going to be a Muslim he should date a Muslim.", "NTA-\n\nHe clearly thought something without asking you directly. You clearly don't want to do that thing. And reacted out of hurt.... \n\nFor what it's worth (as a Jewish person married to a Muslim person), Islamic cultures and faiths have a huge amount in common with Jewish cultures and faiths. Like pretty close. There isn't a lot in opposition at all... \n\nAnd depending on the particular region of your generational origins you and he might have a great deal in common culturally. From experience the interfaith difficulty I experienced in my marriage was largely related to zero things about our faith and cultures.... other people had more opinions than either of us do. And neither of us converted to anything.\n\nFrankly, if what he's looking for is that you convert than that is a fundamental incompatibility.... which you only learn through dating.

You want to have a long-term relationship so you\u2019re marrying the first guy you get involved with, even though you have a major incompatibility.

There is certainly a way to make it work and it\u2019s kind of uncool to tell you there isn\u2019t. But you will also have to be OK with being a second class citizen in a mosque, the same friend is still happily married but will not go to the mosque because she refuses to sit in a separate area from the men and be treated as lesser than.

Judaism and Christianity share much more by the way of ethics and theologies than does either with Islam.", "That\u2019s the part I stopped reading \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab Doesn\u2019t make any sense. There are certain things that should prevent you from staying with someone\u2026 this is one of them", "Also if you definitely know what you will do when there are kids. If both parents are committed to their faiths and are practicing, there can be some issues.  But you need to know before there are kids\u2026.kids do change everything.  I\u2019ve known some who were lackadaisical in their religion until kids came into the equation.  Then suddenly religion was critical.", "But it is an important conversation to have. 3 year relationship is long enough to start thinking into the future whether that includes marriage or not. I didn't grow up in a small town, but 4 couples from my grad year ended up marrying their high sweet hearts. If you've been dating someone for 3 years, serious conversations should come up regardless of age.", "Exactly.  This is the point of these conversations.  Find out if you have compatible ideas or areas of compromise.  If not, time to move on.  You should also talk about children, careers, finances, where you want to live, etc.", "Technically, Muslim men can only marry Christian or Jewish women, only if the intention is that they may consider converting later.\n\nThere are also other restrictions as well, for example the children have to be raised Muslim", ">before you can legally drink is so dumb.\n\nLaughs in european", "And there it is. He can be a true Jewish man just as easily by converting! Why's that not an option?", "lol", "You sound like you have issues.\n\nAre you ok mentally", "King?\n\n\nMore like a sheep lmao", "Yes they do, it was the first thing I told his mom when I met her.

I\u2019m a Christian, so I believe you have to accept Jesus into your heart to actually be a Christian, not just follow the rules and celebrate the holidays, but I think that really goes for any religion. A true conversion is changing your belief system and world view, not just following traditions.", "He sounds controlling too. A glimpse into the future.", "Especially since it's not true! Muslim men are allowed to marry women of the book - which means Christian and Jewish women. So this really shouldn't be a big deal to him.", "A woman, too.\n\nI don't want to marry the Pope or the Quran. I want to marry a person with a mind of her own.", "its not inherently scary sounding. religiously, Muslims guys are able to marry non-Muslim women. Like he said though, its going to be hard to raise kids in an interfaith relationship, where one person is really religious and the other person doesn't follow the same religion. He might have assumed that she was willing to convert since she doesn't care to stay Jewish and goes to religious events with him. I do think that he is obviously in the wrong for just assuming though. Religiously he also shouldn't be dating anyone though so thats a bit hypocritical", "All three religions are related so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.", "That's... not really true. Islam follows after Judaism and Christianity, and Muslims believe both Moses and Jesus were prophets of Islam. There's massive overlap. In my experience, Muslims and Jews are closer than either with Christians, both socially and in terms of practice. (Food restrictions, etc),", "That's not true though. Christians like to think that but Judaism aligns much more closely to Islam. Both (Judaism and Islam) are truly monotheistic. Per Jewish beliefs and Muslim beliefs (I'm Jewish) Christians are practicing polytheism and are idol worshippers with their belief in Jesus as divine (Christians may not believe they are but that is what many Jews see Christians as). Jews are not allowed to pray in a church, we are however allowed to pray in a mosque. Jews and Muslims are both required to pray multiple times per day. Our services are similar. We have similar food restrictions. Also, Judeo-Christian values is a made up concept by Christians to make them seem closer to Judaism (because when so called \"Judeo-Christian\" values are brought up 99.9% of the time the person is talking only about Christian values that have no linkage to Judaism).", "thats not true at all, all three are very similar. Religious Jewish people are probably more similar to religious Muslims than Christians", "I think this varies greatly. Depending on who is in the pulpit.", "eh i didn\u2019t get into my first relationship until i was 26 & i still learned a lot about what i want veeery sloooowly. then held on way too long before breaking it off.  \nthinking about marriage at all at 19 is hard for me to imagine, so i side-eye read the whole thing.", "Yup. Interfaith relationships with kids ARE hard, so OP is wrong to think that's nbd.

I\u2019m ex-evangelical, not quite agnostic but definitely not religious. When we agreed to be an official couple we were very clear with each other- I will never try to make him not-Catholic and he will never try to make me Catholic. However, at the outset of the relationship he said that his wedding would be in a Catholic Church and his kids would be baptized Catholic, so if I wasn\u2019t okay with that we should quit before we start. \n\nAlways always talk about this stuff from the get-go, otherwise it\u2019s gonna cause a lot of issues down the road.", "From what I know the only restriction is they indeed agree to raise the children as Muslims but they needn't to convert themselves. Moreover as they are currently dating (if this story is not fake), I assume he doesn't follow his religion in a very strict way. OP should discuss with him about all his views about religion and what being Muslim implies according to him, not just regarding their potential futur mariage.\nLast, if the topics of his wife religion is important for him, I find it very telling he didn't bring the issue from the begining.", "Yeah you got me there.

Without Judaism, they don't exist.", "Culturally and politically they're incredibly different.\n\nThere seem to be far more Muslims out there who wish death upon Israelis compared to Christians in my experience.\n\nIt would be far more awkward in many places to have a Muslim marrying a Jew compared to a Christian marrying a Jew.", "This!!!! I totally agree", "Christianity has many theological variants. Some are monotheistic and some pray to saints.", "How are you defining \"religious\" there are plenty of faithful, practicing Reformed Jews just as there are Orthodox. And then you have all of the variations within Islam and the extent of its orthodoxy based on where people grew up and which sect they follow. And then you have Christianity which ranges from Eastern Orthodox Catholics, Coptic Christians, and Roman Catholics to all variations of Protestants from conservative Evangelicals to liberal megachurches and everything in between. Protestant Christianity, I agree, is probably off in its own corner, but there's a fair amount of ritual similarity amongst (especially Orthodox) Catholic Christianity in practices, e.g. circumcision and bathing/hand washing, between Judaism and Islam.", "And can you provide the evidence that what you say is a fact \n\nOr is it just a messed up opinion you claim to be a fact", "Amongst other things, yes.", "2 months ago they'd been dating almost 2 years. Now they have been dating 3 years? Maybe she's not good at math or picking boyfriends.", "And politics.  Some places have to publicly demonstrate their family\u2019s piousness and it wouldn\u2019t be socially acceptable to do that\u2026", "No Abraham\u2019s sons are the basis for Islam and Judaism. Both are fascinating. Christianity is an offshoot of Judaism. Christianity is a blanket term that covers many many belief systems that are extremely diverse.", "You just conflated religion with geo-politics. Judaism and Israel are not the same thing.", "You're just Islamophobic, my dear friend.", "True, some don't see Jesus as divine in any form, like unitarian Christians I believe. What Jews have issue with is the Christians who see Jesus as son of God and someone to pray to. Since Jesus doesn't meet the criteria for the messiah (at least per Jewish beliefs) he was not anything more than a normal human like you or me. Thus praying to him would be polytheism (to us) since in the Jewish view he is a false God.\n\n I also totally understand that Christians don't view it that way and they believe they're right. Like cool for them, I'm not against Christians doing their own thing, we (Jews) are just not a fan of when they try to get others to believe their beliefs (proselytizing). Like you do your thing, I'll do mine. :) \n\nOn a side note, interestingly there's been many people who have claimed to be the messiah. And at least per Jewish beliefs, none (including Jesus) have met the criteria for the real messiah. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_messiah\\_claimants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_messiah_claimants)", "Except one of these things has a much more significant impact than the other.\n\nKnowing that Jesus is mentioned more than Muhammad in the Qur'an isn't actually esre knowledge. Knowing that Christians and Jews are reffered to as 'people of the book' also isn't that rare.\n\nFor many people out there including many Muslims the only thing they thing they care about when it comes to Israel is Jewish persecution of Palestinians and the wars with Arab nations. They're not typically thinking about the large Israeli Arab population there. \n\nIt isn't as important that many Jews and Muslims don't eat pork.\n\nThat being said you are correct that I essentially changed the subject.\n\nYour initial point was completely correct.", "People's religious beliefs have no impact upon my life. If anyone has a religion it's their business and not mine.\n\nBut I feel no need to defend myself against your statement.", "I will clarify as to why - not for you, but for people reading.\n\nIf I said, clearly all Jewish people want to kill Muslims because of the actions of some extremists in Israel, that would be pretty obviously anti-Semitic. You've done the same thing. Firstly, assuming a political disagreement means that there must be a resort to violence, and secondly, generalizing the actions of a few extremists to the majority. If anyone knows how terrible that experience is, it's Muslims. In the U.S., for example, I've found Muslims and Jews have a close alliance, because we're both minority religions that have to address the difficulty of that. \n\nI hope you treat the Muslims in your life, and who you interact with, with dignity and respect, and you spend some time reconsidering your prejudices.", "So if I said that there are millions of Jews in the world who wish death upon Muslims I would no longer be considered Islamophobic? \n\nIf so you really need to brush up on what that word actually means. I think you also need to better understand what it means to be anti-semitic as well. \n\nIt sounds like you're a pretty respectful person though and I appreciate that.\n\nThanks for actually responding.", "No, you would still be. It's the assumption that a belief held by some members of a group is reflective of all members of that group, especially when the belief is negative. \n\nThe statement that Muslims wish death upon Israelis is a continuation of Islamophobic sentiments of Muslims as violent, terrorists, et cetera. People can want liberation for Palestine and not wish harm on anyone; I personally would love a political one-state solution, but I don't want anyone to be hurt or displaced.   \n\n\nOn the political side, I know plenty of anti-Zionist Jews, who would be offended at the conflation of Judaism and Israel. They're really not the same thing, and again, culturally, there's a lot of overlap between Muslims and Jews, from food to superstitions (hamsas), even hair covering in different communities, as well as being oppressed groups in many countries. People aren't geopolitics.", "There is no Muslim-majority nation that has not systematically persecuted all minorities within its borders in the last century.  It's fine when they're the minority in a nation, but whenever they are rulers,  it's not a great place for anyone else.  See Lebanon for an example of how that went...or all the Coptics in Egypt, or the former Jews of Iran, Iraq etc.  Those who emigrate to Western or other nations act respectfully because they are outnumbered.", "Where did I make the assumption that all Muslims hate Jews?\n\nThis is a statement so obviously untrue that I genuinely didn't think I had to clarify it. But I suppose this is Reddit and I should've been more aware. I profusely apologise to anyone who took it that way.\n\nI actually agree with you BTW. I don't think a two-state solution could ever work because there would always be a massive power imbalance which would only escalate tensions. You would need everyone living in Palestine or Israel to recognise that working together is infinitely more beneficial. Both in terms of security as well as the economy.\n\nI hope that in my life time I eventually witness a Middle East where no one feels limited on where they can live due to their spiritual beliefs.\n\nBut I do take issue with one of your points. I do not believe that pointing out that many Muslims hate Jews and that many Jews hate Muslims is anti-semitic or Islamophobic. By your own logic you would have to label millions of Muslim Arabs as being anti-semitic and millions of Israeli Jews as being Islamophobic.\n\nIf you watch a news report where Israeli flags are being burnt in nations with large Muslim populations it isn't Islamophobic to point out that the Muslims involved probably hate Jews or Israelis. I very much doubt the people doing the flag burning are distinguishing between Israeli Jews, Arabs and the many other communities who reside in Israel.\n\nSimilarly, I don't believe that pointing out that many terrorists have Islamic beliefs is Islamophobic and I shouldn't have to use examples of terrorism or other horrific crimes being committed by non-Muslims to somehow absolve myself of such accusations.\n\nNo one is born as an anti-semite or an Islamophobe. It's something that many people out there unfortunately learn from their environment and upbringing."]}
