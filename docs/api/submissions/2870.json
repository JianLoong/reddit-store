As a side note I  grew up on Marine bases and know the Marines teach once a Marine always a Marine and like all military branches they value loyalty sounds like your family forgot that. Also my friends and myself as well were strongly discouraged from joining the military unless you go officer route like become a pilot and get out at the earliest possible and go commercial or get the military to pay for med or law school. It want don't join its was don't join without purpose so you don't go meat grinder wasting your time or life.", "NTA. In any way shape or form. \n\nMy mom's family is a military and medical family, for generations. My grandfather was a navy engineer, my uncles were in the army(2of them) and the navy(1 of them), my male cousins went into every single branch from the Airforce to the Coast Guard. Hell, we have family that was in the calvary way back when. My dad(stepdad) was a Marine. My brother and stepbrother are both Marines. \n\nThe vast majority of women in my family have some degree of medical school under our belts, from CNAs to registered nurses, to dentistry, to pediatrics.\n\nSo let me tell you something. You ARE a Marine OP. No one can take that fact away from you just because you did not reenlist. You did your duty, served your country, protected your brothers in your unit. \n\nYou are still serving your country, and protecting your community. I don't care if you are a janitor or a claims rep at your local hospital, OP, the fact of the matter is, hospitals are hot zones of all kinds of infections. Hospitals are the front lines in the home front. Not just for Covid, for everything. You are still putting yourself at risk going to work so that you can help other people. If there is anything that honors the Marines motto of \"To serve and protect\" more than that, please, tell me? \n\nAnd you are also not an asshole if the only reason you joined the service was so that you could access student loans and home loans afterwards. Our system is set up to purposefully funnel poor people into our military with the promise that it will improve your life afterwards. It is a pyramid scheme in a very real sense. Realizing that and working within that system doesn't make you any less of a real Marine either. It just means you have common sense. \n\nYour life is yours to live. You do not have to live your life to please anyone else other than you and your wife. (Because let's be real, wife does have a say, since you merged yours with hers. That's just being respectful lol.) If your parents, siblings, and extended family are draining your mental health, take a break from them. There is such a thing as loving someone from a distance. Boundaries are important. You don't have to have kids to be successful. Maybe you guys are having infertility issues, maybe you're just happy to not have kids, both are valid. \n\nSkip Thanksgiving this year. Skip Christmas too if you need too. Send a nice card, and gift yourself a quiet vacation in a B&B with the wife for a couple of days of no phone, no internet, no work, just a nice break from the entire world. Peace and quiet really are the best gift you can give someone.", "NTA.  I honestly gave up on family holidays a long time ago. My mom still tries to get everyone together in some Norman Rockwell ideal of Thanksgiving. But everyone has their own separate lives and really don't like being around each other anymore.", "NTA. Your family sounds terrible. If it were me, I would have gone LC long ago. They don't get to judge and berate you for choosing a different life path, not to mention one that helps care for people since you work in a hospital. You deserve to spend your holiday with your wife and enjoy it.", "NTA, it's okay to stay at home since your family sound toxic. You are not a failure in wanting a different career path. Not everyone enjoy being in the military. And at your age, don't be in a hurry to have kids either. Kids are expensive to take care of. There is a time and a place for that at a later time.", "NTA at all. Your family is bullying you.

In reality, the military is full of nutcases who couldn't do anything else / didn't want to put in any effort elsewhere / just wanted to feel special and powerful-- these are all the types who tend to make it a career.

My brother met his wife during his stint in the Navy. He was then deployed a week before his daughter was born and jumped through every hoop possible to delay deployment but they didn't care. He didn't get to meet his daughter until she was 7 months old. After that, he decided it wasn't for him. He would rather be there for every milestone moment of his kid's life. They now have three daughters and he gets to come home every night to spend time with his family and doesn't regret his decision to leave for a second. Don't get me wrong, he enjoyed some aspects of the Navy but ultimately had to choose between being there for his family or a career in the military. He chose his family.  \n\nYour family should be supporting your path, and if they can't how long can you put up with the constant harassment?
