Military life isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s hard. And it\u2019s hard on families. Tell mom you aren\u2019t the immature one. The rest of them are for being such giant AHs. Enjoy Thanksgiving with your lovely wife.", "NTA. It's not \"kidding\" it's bullying. They're bullying you for choosing civilian life over the military. FTR, working in a hospital is NOT an easy job.", "NTA.  A joke is not a get out of jail free card for someone to be as insulting as they want to be.  You have chosen your own path and they should be respectful and supportive of that.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t kidding and you aren\u2019t being too sensitive, your family doesn\u2019t respect you or the choices you\u2019ve made and they make a point of letting you know this with their bullying. You have every right to not want to spend the holiday with people who think nothing of insulting and demeaning you. You and your wife have a happy Thanksgiving.", "NTA. It would be \"kidding\" if it didn't hurt you. It does, so it is definitely not \"just kidding\". Also, \"kidding\" would be just one time. Stay home with your wife and have the best Thanksgiving ever! :)", "NTA. Cutting toxic family events to reduce your stress level so you and your wife can enjoy the holidays is the furthest thing from immature.", "Tell them you'll be helping to save lives instead of killing brown children in the rich people's oil wars \ud83e\udd14", "NTA. If you do end up going, bring the crayola tub of crayons and set it out with the deserts \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc", "NTA. Your family is obnoxious. Enjoy your holiday!", "NTA. It\u2019s super weird that your family is picking this hill to die on. You joined the marines and now you\u2019re out, because you wanted to do something else. They might be so stuck on it because that\u2019s all they feel like they\u2019ve ever accomplished, but either way, that\u2019s not you or your wife\u2019s problem.", "NTA.  If they\u2019re \u201cjust kidding,\u201d they can realize it\u2019s not funny to anyone but them and knock it off at least while you\u2019re around.  You don\u2019t have to be \u201csensitive\u201d to not want to spend your holidays being hassled over your life choices instead of having people be excited for what you *are* doing.  If your family isn\u2019t willing to make that adjustment, then *they* can quit being \u201csensitive\u201d and deal with your absence.", "NTA.  Spend the holiday with the family that loves and supports you.  Anyone who thinks a hospital job (of any kind) isn't stressful is delusional.", "NTA. I'm considering skipping Thanksgiving because of constant insults to my job choice, too. It's tiring.", "NTA! Do it, stay home! And please feel no guilt about it. Every time your are allowing them to say those things to you. Enough is enough. This doesn\u2019t mean you love them any less. They should be proud of you not disable the accomplishment and choices you\u2019ve made.", "Oh yes, working in hospital saving (or at least helping saving) lives. Such a failure.\nIf I were you I'd just stay home and have a quiet and happy holiday time.", "NTA! Have a wonderful, relaxing day. They'll find someone else to give the traditional sh\\*t to. Families like this always do.", "NTA ... Stick to your guns. Don't go to a family gathering where you're picked on by the bullies in your family.  \nWhat you might want to do is print this entire string out and mail it to the event.", "NTA\n\nLooks like it's time to go LC with your family permanently, not only for the holidays, if for them a \"joke\" is more important than your mental well-being.", "NTA. You don't sound like a failure at all. Come on over, we will serve you some food, and don't care about the Marines.", "NTA. You served, fulfilled your commitment, and then left with your head held high. There is nothing wrong with that. You chose not to make the Marines be everything you are. \n\nTell your mom it's funny once or twice, but not yearly. Maybe they can look at the empty chairs and reflect on their leadership (mom and dad) and actions (the rest).", "NTA. You\u2019re a grown adult capable of making their own decisions. Have a nice thanksgiving with the people who will appreciate you being there and fuck the haters.", "NTA. If they're just kidding - then what exactly makes this joke funny? I wonder if your mom can explain it.\n\nYou should be proud of all you've done, both by serving your country in the Marines, and now by working in a hospital (which honestly can also be considered serving your country, especially given the pandemic). Celebrate with your wife, and have a peaceful holiday.", "NTA. Enjoy your holiday and maybe zoom call your mom after dinner and exchange pleasantries if you want to", "NTA, how is that a fair comparison? You're different people with different goals. Having a kid isn't a milestone you should be \"running after\", it's a commitment you should consider when you and your partner think the time is right", "NTA. Your taking care of your family, your happy, and probably make more than them. Keep living your best life.\n\nYour family is TA. As a side note I  grew up on Marine bases and know the Marines teach once a Marine always a Marine and like all military branches they value loyalty sounds like your family forgot that. Also my friends and myself as well were strongly discouraged from joining the military unless you go officer route like become a pilot and get out at the earliest possible and go commercial or get the military to pay for med or law school. It want don't join its was don't join without purpose so you don't go meat grinder wasting your time or life.", "NTA. In any way shape or form. \n\nMy mom's family is a military and medical family, for generations. My grandfather was a navy engineer, my uncles were in the army(2of them) and the navy(1 of them), my male cousins went into every single branch from the Airforce to the Coast Guard. Hell, we have family that was in the calvary way back when. My dad(stepdad) was a Marine. My brother and stepbrother are both Marines. \n\nThe vast majority of women in my family have some degree of medical school under our belts, from CNAs to registered nurses, to dentistry, to pediatrics.\n\nSo let me tell you something. You ARE a Marine OP. No one can take that fact away from you just because you did not reenlist. You did your duty, served your country, protected your brothers in your unit. \n\nYou are still serving your country, and protecting your community. I don't care if you are a janitor or a claims rep at your local hospital, OP, the fact of the matter is, hospitals are hot zones of all kinds of infections. Hospitals are the front lines in the home front. Not just for Covid, for everything. You are still putting yourself at risk going to work so that you can help other people. If there is anything that honors the Marines motto of \"To serve and protect\" more than that, please, tell me? \n\nAnd you are also not an asshole if the only reason you joined the service was so that you could access student loans and home loans afterwards. Our system is set up to purposefully funnel poor people into our military with the promise that it will improve your life afterwards. It is a pyramid scheme in a very real sense. Realizing that and working within that system doesn't make you any less of a real Marine either. It just means you have common sense. \n\nYour life is yours to live. You do not have to live your life to please anyone else other than you and your wife. (Because let's be real, wife does have a say, since you merged yours with hers. That's just being respectful lol.) If your parents, siblings, and extended family are draining your mental health, take a break from them. There is such a thing as loving someone from a distance. Boundaries are important. You don't have to have kids to be successful. Maybe you guys are having infertility issues, maybe you're just happy to not have kids, both are valid. \n\nSkip Thanksgiving this year. Skip Christmas too if you need too. Send a nice card, and gift yourself a quiet vacation in a B&B with the wife for a couple of days of no phone, no internet, no work, just a nice break from the entire world. Peace and quiet really are the best gift you can give someone.", "NTA.  I honestly gave up on family holidays a long time ago. My mom still tries to get everyone together in some Norman Rockwell ideal of Thanksgiving. But everyone has their own separate lives and really don't like being around each other anymore.", "NTA. Your family sounds terrible. If it were me, I would have gone LC long ago. They don't get to judge and berate you for choosing a different life path, not to mention one that helps care for people since you work in a hospital. You deserve to spend your holiday with your wife and enjoy it.", "NTA, it's okay to stay at home since your family sound toxic. You are not a failure in wanting a different career path. Not everyone enjoy being in the military. And at your age, don't be in a hurry to have kids either. Kids are expensive to take care of. There is a time and a place for that at a later time.", "NTA at all. Your family is bullying you. Stay home with your wife and enjoy the day as you see fit. \n\nI\u2019m not getting the November-Marine-cake connection?", "NTA", "NTA. Have your own Thanksgiving and be thankful for whoever attends.  \n\nAlso when they give you shit about working in a hospital, tell them to try patching one of the gunshot wounds they\u2019re trained to inflict and see who\u2019s got the harder job.", "NTA.\n\nSpend the holiday in a way you can enjoy it. You aren't obligated to put up with the hazing because they can't accept your life choices.", "Absolutely NTA. So you mom says it\u2019s a \u201cjoke\u2019\u2019? Totally passive aggressive behaviour on their behalf. Be strong and do your own thing", ">\tSince it\u2019s November every thanksgiving has to have a marine birthday cake and leads to comments about me not acknowledging that\u2019s marine birthday on Facebook?\n\nA boot thanksgiving. \n\nIf you have to parade your \u201cheroism\u201d for everyone to see, it isn\u2019t heroism. It\u2019s being a prick. \n\nYou are completely justified in telling them to stop with the comments, and I too would be skipping this thanksgiving. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nTell your cousins the oil companies appreciate their service.", "NTA, first thank you for your service.  Second saty home you told your mom. All she did was make an excuse for the others. It might take some time for them to see how this effects you.

If so, could you just do a day, or just the meal, and then make an excuse?  Maybe the hospital needs you during these difficult times, something like that?\n\nOr could you find it in yourself to rise above it and not allow them to get under your skin?  Difficult, I know.  Families know better than anyone which buttons to press.\n\nI don't think you can win this one really, unless not giving a shit what they say counts as winning.
