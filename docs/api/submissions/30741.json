So I got him all sorted and told him his total ($78). He pulls out his wallet and flips through some bills and pulls out a 100. When he pulls it out, he stretches it out lengthwise, and when he goes to hand it to me, the bill rolls up into a tube shape. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know exactly what this is as I have gotten many of these before and I have always accepted them, but this time I was not having it because as I looked at the bill, I noticed TONS of white leftover cocaine still stuck to the bill, with what I can only guess is snot and blood stained onto the bill alongside the cocaine. \n\nSo I just look at the guy and said \"really man?\", to which he says \"What?\".\n\nI say, \"You know what dude, I'm not taking that bill, that is really gross\"\n\nHe says, \"I'm sorry bro but its all I got, I only have $15 in 5's left in my wallet\"\n\nSo I told him he can pay with debit or credit or find some new bills to give me that are reasonably clean. He starts getting loud and frustrated and tells me that he only has 'x' amount left in his bank account (which wouldn't cover it).\n\nSo I told him that it's not my problem and I'm not accepting that bill for not only the sake of cleanliness, but also because it could have fentanyl on it and it's entirely possible for someone to overdose on fentanyl by touching it and getting it into my mouth/nose by accident. \n\nHe starts getting really angry and yelling at me, telling that legally I have to accept the money because its legal tender and I can't refuse legal tender. I told again, I don't care what laws you think exist, I have the right to refuse service and I will if he can't provide any sort of other payment. \n\nHe continues yelling me that its the only way he can buy weed and he won't be able to get weed if I don't take the bill. I asked him to leave and let me serve the other customer if he has no other way to pay for it. He calls me names and continues to yell and swear as he leaves the store.\n\nThe other customer in store immediately starts ripping into me the second the first guy left, telling me that I could have just taken it and washed my hands after. I ignored what he said and just went straight to business, just asking him normally what I can help him with. He mumbles something under his breath and just walks out. \n\nLater that day, someone (who I presume was the first guy) left a 1 star review on our Google listing, claiming we don't take cash and kicked him out of the store for trying to use cash, obviously not telling that his bill had cocaine, snot and blood on it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I didn't do anything wrong, I kept my cool the whole time and never raised my voice or anything but since the second guy seemed to be upset about it as well, I'm questioning whether or not it's unreasonable to decline a bill like that?
