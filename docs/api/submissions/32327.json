Even if she's okay with being near strawberries, another tier of the same cake would be worrisome to me. But as long as she's not completely excluded from dessert, either the other tiers or another dessert, it's fine. \n\n\nShe's right that you should have a section for allergies on the RSVP though. Make sure there is at least one option for everyone, and that things with a certain ingredient are clear. \n\n\nI have a friend who is allergic to lots of fruit, we gave him a heads up about our cake before the wedding. But we were at another wedding, and the cupcakes had strawberries in them that weren't obvious. My husband happened to eat one and tell him \"Hey, I just had a cupcake and it had a strawberry in it, heads up\". But had this guy grabbed a cupcake first, it could have been bad. \n\n\nMy husband is a vegetarian and we were at a wedding. A waiter was passing out egg rolls and he asked if there was meat in it and they had no clue. Knowing allergies, you can say to the waiters, \"Make sure you can answer that X has Y in it.\"", "NTA\n\nMy MIL (and 3 other guests) share the same, reasonably significant food allergy and didn\u2019t expect our wedding cake to be suitable for them. \n\nHubs and I wanted them to be able to enjoy with us so I arranged for there to be a separate cake which they could eat, which was decorated to match the main cake. They were over the moon and so appreciative but none of them expected it or would have kicked off if it wasn\u2019t available. \n\nYou already have 2 tiers of cake that she can eat so to my mind there isn\u2019t an issue, except that she\u2019s not getting her own way 100%", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s making it seem like the most important aspect of this day is her ability to eat, or not eat, cake. \n\nShe\u2019s made a weird powerplay over cake.

What if your fianc\u00e9 wanted something that she hated...would she demand he change his desires too?\n\nI think by having 2 entire tiers of your cake separate, you've given her options.

Strawberries in birthday cake - you love it but at 27 despite wanting this you've never had it. While it's understandable, given your mother, that you didn't pre 18, you admit you haven't since because of how she'd behave if you had strawberry birthday cake with other people. Seriously, do you realise how ridiculous that sounds?\n\n2. Your wedding - it's really your mother's wedding (I wouldn't be surprised if she turns up in white!). She picked the venue. She picked the decorations. For your only wedding. So what if you're her only daughter - it's your wedding! Could you and your fiancee not have saved up the 2k contribution and made those decisions yourselves? What else has she chosen?\n\n3. The wedding cake - you're more worried about the fact that she's upset over the strawberry cake than your fiancee hating the flavour of the largest tier - flavour chosen only because of her. You've admitted she actually eats strawberries when she craves them despite her allergy. You didn't mention that in the main section and it would have highlighted how ridiculous she's being. If she chooses to eat strawberries she could actually eat a slice of strawberry cake if she wanted to. But you've continued to pander to her nonsense and sense of entitlement over the years. And apparently teaching your fiancee to as well. No idea why they'd agree to their wedding cake including a flavour they hate.\n\n\nSo when are you going to stop giving in to your mother on everything. I think you need to sit down and look at how many decisions you've made as an adult where you chose what you wanted vs what your mother wanted. \nAsk yourself what's going to happen at the next important phase of your life - kids. Are you going to let her steamroller you there too with decisions?", "NTA your mom is being very dramatic about eating some cake. She doesn't need to eat every part of the cake, that's absurd.

We had a whole dessert table so there really was something for everyone.", "We copied a friend who had regular sized cakes on each table.

I had something with strawberries in it not too long ago and needed an EPI pen. I 100% agree with your mom, and everyone else. I also agree that invites should ask if there are allergies.

The pancreas does not produce enough insulin \u2014 a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells. And cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar", "By lack of self control I assume you mean poor diet and lack of exercise - which do contribute to diabetes, sure.  But genetics and issues like PCOS and insulin resistance are a major cause of it as well, as I unfortunately discovered for myself, despite increasing exercise and following a low carb diet.", "For some patients with T2D, yes, but you\u2019re getting close to being wrong by saying \u201cgenerally speaking\u201d.", "Not all all allergies are this severe lol. I'm allergic to two different things and I get a mild rash from them. That's it. Never had a reaction from cross contamination at all. I know plenty of people with similar allergies. I have a friend who picks out one ingredient, and eats the rest without any problems.", "Or, they could be an adult and just not eat the cake?", "You do know she can skip the cake, right? And that she\u2019s also diabetic and SHOULD skip the cake, or at least not actively plan to eat four slices of it at one event.", "Good point.  I forgot about the tendency of allergies to spring surprises.\n\n(Assuming you are being sarcastic)", "Or OP's mom isn't actually allergic and just thinks she is because an allergy test showed her back got a little red when they scratched the fuck out of it then rubbed it with a fucking strawberry.", "Ok, but the mother isn't going to have an allergic reaction, she just won't get to eat part of the cake.", "Uh, that sounds very specific.", "We did something like a layer of wax paper, layer of plastic wrap, layer of tinfoil, maybe a plastic bag too(?), so there was a ton of wrapping. It was nice because we\u2019d done a COVID micro-wedding and then a year later got to eat the piece of cake in our hotel room after holding the big wedding celebration we had postponed.", "To be fair, most people with Type 1 are pretty good at controlling their sugar intake since not doing so usually has much more severe consequences.", "And type 2 is by FAR the most common in the US.\n\nThis is like saying you can get AIDS from a blood transfusion. Yeah, it's happened, but it's a tiny percentage of the total HIV/AIDS cases.\n\nType 1 makes up about 5% of all cases. It's basically not worth talking about in this context.", "If you're paying for the cake, you usually want a slice of the cake.", "No that\u2019s a legitimate thing that happens. I have an anaphylactic allergy to peaches and nectarines, it wasn\u2019t always anaphylactic and guess what happened the last time I accidentally ate something with peach?", "You can develop allergies as an adult. I went to sushi with my best friend and had to go to the ER with hives, throat getting tight, stomach issues. I ate sushi all the time but that day I had edamame, miso soup, dipped sushi in soy sauce. Even had a bite of teriyaki chicken. I\u2019m at the allergist doing shots and now it\u2019s not I\u2019m going to die it\u2019s I need a toilet for hours. Every allergy is different. I\u2019m allergic to cats and have one but with foods it\u2019s different. She might have liquid shits if she eats strawberries and at a wedding that\u2019s not fun. \n\nedit I still think NTA, mom is an adult she doesn\u2019t have to eat cake since the chocolate layer was made for her.", "Just you wait", "And not everyone gets type 2 because they sat and ate cake on a daily basis.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with type 2, I was immediately told by my doctors that it wasn't my fault. I eat well. I exercise. But both my parents and two of my grandparents had diabetes, [so I was predisposed](https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/genetics-diabetes). But what actually triggered it was the lack of sleep I got for several years due to my work schedule, as well as stress.", "You know reddit extends beyond US borders, right? The ratio between types 1 and 2 vary between country. In the UK, it's about 10% type 1. \n\nBut that's because type 1 is genetic and cannot be aquired, while type 2 can.\n\nYour comment is like saying \"well the vast majority of people with brown hair are born with brown hair, so hair dye doesn't exist\".
