Even if she's okay with being near strawberries, another tier of the same cake would be worrisome to me. But as long as she's not completely excluded from dessert, either the other tiers or another dessert, it's fine. \n\n\nShe's right that you should have a section for allergies on the RSVP though. Make sure there is at least one option for everyone, and that things with a certain ingredient are clear. \n\n\nI have a friend who is allergic to lots of fruit, we gave him a heads up about our cake before the wedding. But we were at another wedding, and the cupcakes had strawberries in them that weren't obvious. My husband happened to eat one and tell him \"Hey, I just had a cupcake and it had a strawberry in it, heads up\". But had this guy grabbed a cupcake first, it could have been bad. \n\n\nMy husband is a vegetarian and we were at a wedding. A waiter was passing out egg rolls and he asked if there was meat in it and they had no clue. Knowing allergies, you can say to the waiters, \"Make sure you can answer that X has Y in it.\"", "NTA\n\nMy MIL (and 3 other guests) share the same, reasonably significant food allergy and didn\u2019t expect our wedding cake to be suitable for them. \n\nHubs and I wanted them to be able to enjoy with us so I arranged for there to be a separate cake which they could eat, which was decorated to match the main cake. They were over the moon and so appreciative but none of them expected it or would have kicked off if it wasn\u2019t available. \n\nYou already have 2 tiers of cake that she can eat so to my mind there isn\u2019t an issue, except that she\u2019s not getting her own way 100%", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s making it seem like the most important aspect of this day is her ability to eat, or not eat, cake. \n\nShe\u2019s made a weird powerplay over cake.

What if your fianc\u00e9 wanted something that she hated...would she demand he change his desires too?\n\nI think by having 2 entire tiers of your cake separate, you've given her options.

Not sure why you didn't include the tidbit of info above in the main post.\n\nYou're **NTA,** but a different solution might be having a special \"bride's cake\" with lemon/strawberry that is separate from the main confection. Might be a little more acceptable to her.", "NTA -- There are other layers/cakes available.  If you made them \\*all\\* strawberry, that would be inconsiderate.   Mother of the groom here, my son's bride really loves stuffed peppers.  I have a strong sensitivity to stuffed peppers.

In regards to the actual strawberries in wedding cake NTA but in general your lack of a backbone with your mother Y T A.\n\nI've read through your comments and here's what's concerning of what I've seen:\n\n1. Strawberries in birthday cake - you love it but at 27 despite wanting this you've never had it. While it's understandable, given your mother, that you didn't pre 18, you admit you haven't since because of how she'd behave if you had strawberry birthday cake with other people. Seriously, do you realise how ridiculous that sounds?\n\n2. Your wedding - it's really your mother's wedding (I wouldn't be surprised if she turns up in white!). She picked the venue. She picked the decorations. For your only wedding. So what if you're her only daughter - it's your wedding! Could you and your fiancee not have saved up the 2k contribution and made those decisions yourselves? What else has she chosen?\n\n3. The wedding cake - you're more worried about the fact that she's upset over the strawberry cake than your fiancee hating the flavour of the largest tier - flavour chosen only because of her. You've admitted she actually eats strawberries when she craves them despite her allergy. You didn't mention that in the main section and it would have highlighted how ridiculous she's being. If she chooses to eat strawberries she could actually eat a slice of strawberry cake if she wanted to. But you've continued to pander to her nonsense and sense of entitlement over the years. And apparently teaching your fiancee to as well. No idea why they'd agree to their wedding cake including a flavour they hate.\n\n\nSo when are you going to stop giving in to your mother on everything. I think you need to sit down and look at how many decisions you've made as an adult where you chose what you wanted vs what your mother wanted. \nAsk yourself what's going to happen at the next important phase of your life - kids. Are you going to let her steamroller you there too with decisions?", "NTA your mom is being very dramatic about eating some cake. She doesn't need to eat every part of the cake, that's absurd.

We had a whole dessert table so there really was something for everyone.", "We copied a friend who had regular sized cakes on each table.

I had something with strawberries in it not too long ago and needed an EPI pen. I 100% agree with your mom, and everyone else. I also agree that invites should ask if there are allergies.
