Of course every kid who has lost a parent is grieving. Your sister is completely wrong here.", "NTA, next time tell she has no right to grieve her mom and watch her lose her shit\u2026\n\nInfo: what do your parents think about all this?", "NTA. Everybody experiences grief differently. You're right, she shouldn't gatekeep and minimize your grief. Talk to your parents about it.", "NTA.  As hard as this is to process, since it is such a personal attack, is that this really isn't about you.  This is all about what's going on inside her, and she is very clearly struggling.  You have become a focal point for her anger, because she doesn't have anywhere to direct it and you are an easy target.\n\nIt's not fair.  None of it.  Not to you, not to her.  If I can suggest, try to give her grace. Not because her behavior should be tolerated, but because it will make you feel better about yourself.  When she yells at you, remember she isn't really yelling at you.  She's yelling at the world who took her parent away, and you are just the stand in.  I am really sorry you are dealing with this.  Your mom and step-dad need to step up, they really shouldn't be allowing this.  Truly sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "NTA. Everyone deals with grief in different ways and all of those ways are valid. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate yours. It isn\u2019t about her.", "NTA. Pain & grief are not competitive events. \n\nIt's actually odd that she thinks her burden is somehow heavier when both of you sadly lost parents. \n\nIt doesn't sound normal, honestly, and I wonder if she could benefit from some kind of grief counseling? But that's not for you to arrange. Her problems should not be YOUR problems. All you can do is be certain that your own grief is entirely valid no matter what she -- or anyone -- says.", "Nta. She has no right to tell you your grief doesn't matter compared to hers. You both hurt, you both lost a parent and your grief is no less valid than hers.", "NTA, no one has the right to tell you about your own feelings, and on one's grief is more important than anyone else's. Your stepsister may need to talk to someone.", "NTA. Grief isn\u2019t a competition. She\u2019s out of line and you called her on it.", "NTA. Girl sounds very self centered.

Someone trying to stifle your grief process to accommodate their own is terrible behavior.", "NTA\n\nPeople feel grief to different extents. No one person feels the same.", "NTA your Mom sure sucks if she's letting you step sister do this", "NTA I see in comments that your step sister has been in counseling. Have you? There's a really unhealthy dynamic going on, and I strongly suspect that an outside expert perspective would be helpful for you. I might be reading too much into things, but I wonder if her insistence on you not grieving has interfered in your emotional progress and could be making you hold on tighter to your memories and grief. Even if that's not the case, I think your own therapist could help you see where this dynamic isn't normal or healthy.", "NTA. She has more issues than this obviously, but no one has a right to tell you what to feel.", "My stepsister definitely doesn't see it that way. A lot of my friends always wondered how she could feel the way she does. But that's how it has always been. We're not close at all and maybe that's why. She might just dislike me or something idk.", "My mom's husband put her back in therapy when all this started out of concern. My mom doesn't like it either. But she does leave it mostly to her husband since there are times my stepsister will get mad at her if she feels like she's overstepping her mark.", "She's had all that, loads of it. When this whole thing started her dad put her back in therapy because he and my mom were not happy with her saying that stuff to me. But it never changed.", "Or she just needs therapy.", "As she should, this really is a situation for your step dad to deal with. \nHowever this isn\u2019t healthy either, I\u2019d say the next time she says something like that, parrot her words back. \nIf your parents are mad about it, ask them why they aren\u2019t doing anything to stop *her* from it\u2026. \nThat\u2019s my advice", "That's very sad. \n\nBut again, it's HER problem, and she shouldn't be making it yours.", "She's had a lot of therapy for many years. No therapist has been able to help her stop doing this and it's been years. Maybe she's just not willing to participate right now but it's not for the lack of effort on her dad's part."]}
