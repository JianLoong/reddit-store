Not even a little bit. Also, this is not your problem to solve. Your stepdad needs to address it. It sound like his is, and might you just have to bear with it until your stepsister works through whatever is happening. I\u2019m replying to this specifically comment because you said you still have your dad\u2019s family and your stepsister does not have her mom\u2019s family. That\u2019s actually a big thing. It should not diminish your grief or give her the right to gate keep, but that\u2019s probably a big reason she thinks her grief is \u201cbigger\u201d than hers.

It still does NOT excuse her behaviour - but it helps me understand it. Being able to connect with your dad\u2019s family and celebrate things like his birthday is a way of connecting with your father/his memory. If she doesn\u2019t have access to her mom\u2019s family and similar experiences of celebration and remembrance, then she likely feels very disconnected from her mother and is jealous that you still get to experience such connection with your father. \n\nAll that to say, she\u2019s likely lashing out at you due to a combination of sadness, loss, and envy. Again, it doesn\u2019t make it okay. And you are 100% allowed to grieve your father and experience the sadness and loss as well. But try to remember that her lashing out has nothing to do with your grief - it\u2019s just a reflection of her own pain (which she needs to learn to handle in a different way so I hope she goes back to therapy).

If it's the first one, no it's actaully more common that you'd think and if it's the second one - labelling someone's behavior as narccisistic is not calling them an evil person. Narscisstic people can be very abrasive and hard to deal with and usually eventually wear out the ones they interact with because they realy can't help it without proper intervention. Educating and allowing the ones that interact with them on a daily basiss and giving them resources to spot and cope with that behavior ends up improving all of their lives. So I mean we can all pile in on just calling someone an ahole but how does that help anyone.

I do think that minimizing another person\u2019s grief in favor of your own is a bit narcissistic but that doesn\u2019t rise to the level of the full blown personality disorder based on this tiny bit of information.
