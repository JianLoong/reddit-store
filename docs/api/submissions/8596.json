Of course every kid who has lost a parent is grieving. Your sister is completely wrong here.", "NTA! \n\nNext time tell she has no right to grieve her mom and watch her lose her shit\u2026 if she can\u2019t take it why dish it out?\n\nInfo: what do your parents think about all this?", "NTA. Everybody experiences grief differently. You're right, she shouldn't gatekeep and minimize your grief. Talk to your parents about it.", "NTA.  As hard as this is to process, since it is such a personal attack, is that this really isn't about you.  This is all about what's going on inside her, and she is very clearly struggling.  You have become a focal point for her anger, because she doesn't have anywhere to direct it and you are an easy target.\n\nIt's not fair.  None of it.  Not to you, not to her.  If I can suggest, try to give her grace. Not because her behavior should be tolerated, but because it will make you feel better about yourself.  When she yells at you, remember she isn't really yelling at you.  She's yelling at the world who took her parent away, and you are just the stand in.  I am really sorry you are dealing with this.  Your mom and step-dad need to step up, they really shouldn't be allowing this.  Truly sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "NTA. Everyone deals with grief in different ways and all of those ways are valid. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate yours. It isn\u2019t about her.", "NTA. Pain & grief are not competitive events. \n\nIt's actually odd that she thinks her burden is somehow heavier when both of you sadly lost parents. \n\nIt doesn't sound normal, honestly, and I wonder if she could benefit from some kind of grief counseling? But that's not for you to arrange. Her problems should not be YOUR problems. All you can do is be certain that your own grief is entirely valid no matter what she -- or anyone -- says.", "Nta. She has no right to tell you your grief doesn't matter compared to hers. You both hurt, you both lost a parent and your grief is no less valid than hers.", "NTA, no one has the right to tell you about your own feelings, and on one's grief is more important than anyone else's. Your stepsister may need to talk to someone.", "NTA. Grief isn\u2019t a competition. She\u2019s out of line and you called her on it.", "NTA. Girl sounds very self centered.

Someone trying to stifle your grief process to accommodate their own is terrible behavior.", "NTA\n\nPeople feel grief to different extents. No one person feels the same.", "NTA your Mom sure sucks if she's letting you step sister do this", "NTA I see in comments that your step sister has been in counseling. Have you? There's a really unhealthy dynamic going on, and I strongly suspect that an outside expert perspective would be helpful for you. I might be reading too much into things, but I wonder if her insistence on you not grieving has interfered in your emotional progress and could be making you hold on tighter to your memories and grief. Even if that's not the case, I think your own therapist could help you see where this dynamic isn't normal or healthy.", "NTA. She has more issues than this obviously, but no one has a right to tell you what to feel.", "My stepsister definitely doesn't see it that way. A lot of my friends always wondered how she could feel the way she does. But that's how it has always been. We're not close at all and maybe that's why. She might just dislike me or something idk.", "My mom's husband put her back in therapy when all this started out of concern. My mom doesn't like it either. But she does leave it mostly to her husband since there are times my stepsister will get mad at her if she feels like she's overstepping her mark.", "She's had all that, loads of it. When this whole thing started her dad put her back in therapy because he and my mom were not happy with her saying that stuff to me. But it never changed.", "Or she just needs therapy.", "As she should, this really is a situation for your step dad to deal with. \nHowever this isn\u2019t healthy either, I\u2019d say the next time she says something like that, parrot her words back. \nIf your parents are mad about it, ask them why they aren\u2019t doing anything to stop *her* from it\u2026. \nThat\u2019s my advice", "That's very sad. \n\nBut again, it's HER problem, and she shouldn't be making it yours.", "She's had a lot of therapy for many years. No therapist has been able to help her stop doing this and it's been years. Maybe she's just not willing to participate right now but it's not for the lack of effort on her dad's part.", "NTA. You're totally right that she's gatekeeping grief and that's unacceptable. She's immature and I'm glad your stepdad has put her back in therapy (as you say in your comments).", "NTA is she trying to say you bringing up how you miss your dad is reminding her about the loss of her mom, or is she saying that her dad is a better SD to you than your mom is a SM to her? Or that mothers are more important so her grief is bigger? I don\u2019t understand. Maybe she is just bossy?", "op=NTA\n\nBut talk to your Mom, have her and stepfather talk to your stepsister.    \nStepsister doesn't have the right to regulate your emotions/grief.  The parents need to see why she feels the need to minimize your grief/turn your loss into a competition.  \n\nAt this point, I'd say some therapy would be helpful for her.", "NTA. Personally I would call her out every time then put my headphones in or something to avoid the argument lmao. If she doesn\u2019t like your response to her gatekeeping grief, she should stop gatekeeping grief. It\u2019s sad she\u2019s so worried about making grief a competition, you guys could\u2019ve really bonded over your experiences. \n\nI wonder if she feels disconnected from her mothers memory / doesn\u2019t feel the active grief as much & is projecting onto you because she\u2019s lowkey jealous? As in, she sees you grieving / honoring your dad & wishes she was as sad as she perceives you to be. Hard to put into words but grief is super weird. It can feel like a brand new sadness when you begin accepting the death of a loved one. It\u2019s easy to convince yourself you\u2019re a bad person for moving forward with life, then freak out & try to overcompensate. Even if that\u2019s the case, she\u2019s still in the wrong 100%. If it\u2019s not, she should be evaluated for a personality disorder. For real", "NTA. When she pulls this bs, just repeat back to her \u201cyou grief is not better nor worse than my grief. Grief is not a competition.\u201d and just keep repeating that same sentence over when she does it again. And again. And again.  Until you start sounding like a broken record. Do not try to argue with her or engage with her. Just keep saying it and say nothing else. She\u2019s going to be upset but that isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA. No one ever has the right to tell you their grief is somehow more important or deserving than yours. You were right, she is gatekeeping grief. I have sympathy for her as she lost a parent at a young age and I can't imagine the pain of that; but you've literally gone through the same experience. It is toxic of her to try and suppress your grief. She needs help.", "I think she's saying losing a mom is worse than losing a dad.", "I\u2019d also be tempted to ask what you could do to help. I\u2019m wondering if for example OP having dads birthday with dads family triggered her, does mum get acknowledgment? Is her birthday celebrated? Are there pictures? While therapy is helpful, if she\u2019s feeling like it\u2019s being used to make her forget then it\u2019s just going to make her worse", "I have seen a therapist. But I also bring up my dad's death less than she brings up her mom's. So I don't think it could be that.", "She's had a lot of therapy but does not get any better with this. I think that's what makes it so frustrating for me in all of this.", "[removed]", "Maybe try to talk to her about this one on one privately, it could help you guys get closer. Maybe she feels like everyone makes a big deal about your dad and his death and not enough about her mom. Are there pictures out of your dad but not her mom? If your mom makes a casual comment about your dad, like your dad really liked baseball and her and her dad are in the room ask if her mom liked baseball too. If she doesn\u2019t know her dad should say something about it then.", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/Embarrassed_Lion4433 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o72wh/aita_for_telling_my_stepsister_she_doesnt_have/j6dbxt8/\n\nBot Reported."]}
