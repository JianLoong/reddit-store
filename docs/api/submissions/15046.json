You're supposedly dating, so I would hope like hell that asking her a question like that meant you actually gave a damn about the answer. As for the details?

People who ask about other people's days without actually wanting to know always come across as uncaring and disingenuous to me.  \n\nFor the record, if you're uncomfortable with hearing details about injuries it's perfectly reasonable to communicate that boundary.  But you took it way further than you needed to.  A simple \"please don't go into detail about the actual injury, gruesome visuals make me uncomfortable\" would have sufficed.  \n\nAlso at least in my experience, people don't randomly block the people they're dating after one argument if they're in a healthy relationship.  Sounds like this may be your ex gf now.", "YTA - she's your girlfriend, not an acquaintance or random stranger.  When you ask how her day was, she shared what happened like any partner would.  If you aren't a 'gory details' person, use your big boy words and let her know.  Hanging up on her, then leaving a VM telling her to be tactful and that you don't actually care about her injury... yeah, it's not an 'impulse block', it's a you're outta there/you're done/she's not wasting any more time on an AH who doesn't care about her block.", "YTA. You were her boyfriend ffs. You of all people *should* care how her day went. How hard would it have been to communicate and ask her to avoid the gory details instead of hanging up on her?

Also, don\u2019t ask questions if you aren\u2019t truly interested in getting an answer.", "She's not the problem you are, show some empathy man, if she described it in details that means she was trying to convince you, and herself that everything's okay, as for the question you asked only expect a casual answer from acquaintance's, and friends.\n\nThose in relationship answer honestly to that question because in the end of day, only thing in the mind of a person is to talk about their day including good, and bad to those they like.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nThe one person who you should be able to be truly honest with when they ask \"how your day went\" is your partner. If you don't actually care, don't ask.", "YTA - is this for real? Like, you went in panic mode for that, instead of politely ask your gf to not give you details as you \"can't handle it\"? You were very rude to your gf.\n\nAnd on another note, I genuinely want to know how their day went when I ask family or friend about their day, or how they feel. If I don't want to hear an answer I don't ask the question.  You could still be polite with another greeting.", "YTA.\n\nYour (now ex) partner told you something bad that happened to them, likely hoping for sympathy and support. You hung up because it was gross and you didn't want to hear about the gross thing.\n\nThere's an honest answer for you.", "YTA... You didn't think to ask her not to go into detail because you couldn't stomach things like that?  You just hung up on her, and then YOU get upset with HER when you communicate next?  SMH... I would have blocked you, too.  \nAs a side note, my SO actually cares how my day went, and I did his. We listened and cared.  Yeah I ask for/expect generalizations from strangers about their day.  Definitely don't expect my SO to not care.", "YTA.  You ask the lady how her day went but don't actually want to know?  You just admit that upfront and still wonder if you are the asshole?  C'mon...    ....then you hung up on her?  If just hearing about the injury was painful for you....     ....imagine how it felt to suffer said injury?  Maybe she just wanted someone to listen and care about what she went through for a few minutes and you hung up on her?\n\nHonestly.. if she was my friend.. I'd tell her to break it off...", "YTA. Way to make your gf's serious injury all about yourself. \n\nIf you get woozy when hearing someone describing an injury, it is ON YOU to stop them and set an appropriate boundary. The problem here is you. Not your gf in the slightest. I know eight year old kids that have better communication skills than you.\n\nYour gf deserves better than this. Let's hope she keeps that block going.", "YTA.  Yes, some people, like *strangers*, might not always want an honest answer to that question.  But I think it's safe to assume that someone's *partner* actually should care about how their girlfriend's day went.  You're an ass.", "YTA. I hope she broke up with you for good.", "Yta it sounds like you're not really that invested in your girlfriend if you want meaningless platitudes instead of her genuine day", "Dude, you asked follow-up questions after she said she stepped on a nail. YOU ASKED. She answered. Then you blamed her for telling you more than you wanted to know. You were insensitive and rude to her. YTA.", "YTA. When you ask a partner how their day went, you get the details. When you ask a friend/acquaintance/stranger, you get broad strokes.\n\nBy hanging up on her and telling her you just want a generic response, you're really saying, \"I don't really want to hear about your day. I just want you to think I do.\" It shows that you're unsupportive and don't really care.", "YTA. Though \"how are you\" is a superficial question between casual acquaintances or even people who are friendly, it invites deeper discussion between close friends  and lovers.

She's your girlfriend and she just had a major injury! No shit she's giving you details, she's under the mistaken impression that you might be concerned about her and want to know what happened. Sure you might be a bit of a wuss and need to say \"I'm getting a little squeamish. I love you but can we skip the details\" but you just hung up on her! If you think listening to it is bad, try being the one who went through it. \n\nThink about what she's going through. She just had a horrible injury and you bailed. What do you think it says about your ability to help if something bad happens like she breaks her leg while you're out hiking or something. Are you going to just bail on her if that happens as well?

Clearly her talking about that was something that made you incredibly uncomfortable, and you're right, asking about someone's day and if they're ok is not an invitation to detailed injury or medical descriptions.

Have a little empathy, she clearly had a traumatic experience and likely hadn't had someone to talk to about it. Even if it was too much for you, you can do better than just point blank hanging up when someone is describing something bad that happened. And seriously?

I learned some people can talk about amputated limbs and GSWs and gruesome motorcycle accidents over lunch, a lot cannot.", "I married into a family of nurses and lab techs. Polite  is relative lol", "Oh yes, when I was having dinner with people that didn't mind gross talk it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that we'd be talking about a cow exam (I'm sure you know what kind) while eating lmao.", "Nurse here. We can talk poop and puke all through lunch without gagging \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, where is the tact in hanging up on someone you are supposed to care about when they are looking to you for support.", "I laughed so hard at this I woke me dog!", "If you can vomit and somehow look stoic while doing it you should become president", "That's not the kind of details he was asking about.. he asked about doctor visits and tetanus shots, i e. the details of proper precautions in order to actually be ok.\n\nEither way, even though he handled this completely wrong, it's s bit much to call his aversion a \"him\" problem in the context of a romantic relationship. Romantic partners should be *less* harsh with each other than an average stranger would be, not more. He should ask for consideration in a better way, but shouldn't need to just suck it up. That's not how good relationships between people who love each other work.", "BIL and SIL are medicos, I\u2019m a biomedical engineer. Gross body stuff doesn\u2019t phase us over the dinner table.

Not even a wince. I don't know if she should be president though lol", "It\u2019s a him problem until he uses his big boy words to address the issue with his girlfriend and communicate his boundaries. \u201cSorry, babe. That is TMI.\u201d", "Aww come on, p***ies know how to handle blood", "Precisely!  It didn't need to be harsh, or even as long-winded as I am.   \n\n\nWhat u/akula_chan says here is perfect actually.  Maybe a tad more depending on their relationship...but he didn't bother doing any of that.  He didn't even try...just \"click\" then later on doubled down on how it was her fault and how \"people don't really want to know how you are.\""]}
