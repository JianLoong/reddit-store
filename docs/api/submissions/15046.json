You're supposedly dating, so I would hope like hell that asking her a question like that meant you actually gave a damn about the answer. As for the details?

Not her.", "YTA\n\nYou asked how her day was, she replied and rather than communicating to her like an adult that a gruesome story made you uncomfortable, you just hung up on her.

People who ask about other people's days without actually wanting to know always come across as uncaring and disingenuous to me.  \n\nFor the record, if you're uncomfortable with hearing details about injuries it's perfectly reasonable to communicate that boundary.  But you took it way further than you needed to.  A simple \"please don't go into detail about the actual injury, gruesome visuals make me uncomfortable\" would have sufficed.  \n\nAlso at least in my experience, people don't randomly block the people they're dating after one argument if they're in a healthy relationship.  Sounds like this may be your ex gf now.", "YTA - she's your girlfriend, not an acquaintance or random stranger.  When you ask how her day was, she shared what happened like any partner would.  If you aren't a 'gory details' person, use your big boy words and let her know.  Hanging up on her, then leaving a VM telling her to be tactful and that you don't actually care about her injury... yeah, it's not an 'impulse block', it's a you're outta there/you're done/she's not wasting any more time on an AH who doesn't care about her block.", "YTA. You were her boyfriend ffs. You of all people *should* care how her day went. How hard would it have to communicate and ask her to avoid the gory details instead of hanging up on her?

You could have said that you're particularly uncomfortable with the gory details and ask her to limit them, but recognize that's your own preference.", "Yta. You asked a question and got an honest answer, that\u2019s nothing to be upset over.

If you ask me how I'm doing, I'll tell you. If you don't care, don't ask", "YTA\n\nNothing wrong with not wanting the gory details but you could have told her that kindly. Also, don\u2019t ask questions if you aren\u2019t truly interested in getting an answer.", "She's not the problem you are, show some empathy man, if she described it in details that means she was trying to convince you, and herself that everything's okay, as for the question you asked only expect a casual answer from acquaintance's, and friends.\n\nThose in relationship answer honestly to that question because in the end of day, only thing in the mind of a person is to talk about their day including good, and bad to those they like.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nThe one person who you should be able to be truly honest with when they ask \"how your day went\" is your partner. If you don't actually care, don't ask.", "YTA - is this for real? Like, you went in panic mode for that, instead of politely ask your gf to not give you details as you \"can't handle it\"? You were very rude to your gf.\n\nAnd on another note, I genuinely want to know how their day went when I ask family or friend about their day, or how they feel. If I don't want to hear an answer I don't ask the question.  You could still be polite with another greeting.", "YTA.\n\nYour (now ex) partner told you something bad that happened to them, likely hoping for sympathy and support. You hung up because it was gross and you didn't want to hear about the gross thing.\n\nThere's an honest answer for you.", "YTA... You didn't think to ask her not to go into detail because you couldn't stomach things like that?  You just hung up on her, and then YOU get upset with HER when you communicate next?  SMH... I would have blocked you, too.  \nAs a side note, my SO actually cares how my day went, and I did his. We listened and cared.  Yeah I ask for/expect generalizations from strangers about their day.  Definitely don't expect my SO to not care.", "YTA.  You ask the lady how her day went but don't actually want to know?  You just admit that upfront and still wonder if you are the asshole?  C'mon...    ....then you hung up on her?  If just hearing about the injury was painful for you....     ....imagine how it felt to suffer said injury?  Maybe she just wanted someone to listen and care about what she went through for a few minutes and you hung up on her?\n\nHonestly.. if she was my friend.. I'd tell her to break it off...", "YTA. Way to make your gf's serious injury all about yourself. \n\nIf you get woozy when hearing someone describing an injury, it is ON YOU to stop them and set an appropriate boundary. The problem here is you. Not your gf in the slightest. I know eight year old kids that have better communication skills than you.\n\nYour gf deserves better than this. Let's hope she keeps that block going.", "YTA.  Yes, some people, like *strangers*, might not always want an honest answer to that question.  But I think it's safe to assume that someone's *partner* actually should care about how their girlfriend's day went.  You're an ass.", "YTA. I hope she broke up with you for good.", "Yta it sounds like you're not really that invested in your girlfriend if you want meaningless platitudes instead of her genuine day", "Dude, you asked follow-up questions after she said she stepped on a nail. YOU ASKED. She answered. Then you blamed her for telling you more than you wanted to know. You were insensitive and rude to her. YTA.", "YTA. When you ask a partner how their day went, you get the details. When you ask a friend/acquaintance/stranger, you get broad strokes.\n\nBy hanging up on her and telling her you just want a generic response, you're really saying, \"I don't really want to hear about your day. I just want you to think I do.\" It shows that you're unsupportive and don't really care.", "YTA. Though \"how are you\" is a superficial question between casual acquaintances or even people who are friendly, it invites deeper discussion between close friends  and lovers.  In other words, she took you at your work: that you were genuinely interested in her day. Don't ask if you don't want an honest answer.", "YTA. How do you not know YTA??? She's your girlfriend and she just had a major injury! No shit she's giving you details, she's under the mistaken impression that you might be concerned about her and want to know what happened. Sure you might be a bit of a wuss and need to say \"I'm getting a little squeamish. I love you but can we skip the details\" but you just hung up on her! If you think listening to it is bad, try being the one who went through it. \n\nThink about what she's going through. She just had a horrible injury and you bailed. What do you think it says about your ability to help if something bad happens like she breaks her leg while you're out hiking or something. Are you going to just bail on her if that happens as well?

Your girlfriend was talking about a physical trauma, and you hung up as soon as you could.

Do you really need to ask? There is no self awareness these days.", "YTA.  And you just reminded me of a conversation I had years ago with a guy I was dating.

I had blood pouring down my hand.  It wasn\u2019t the only reason I broke up with him but it definitely contributed that he couldn\u2019t even stop to ask if I was okay.

Or did you hang up, leave her hanging in likely a vulnerable and emotional state, and then just text her later like nothing happened?\n\nMy gut says everyone is a bit of an AH here. Clearly her talking about that was something that made you incredibly uncomfortable, and you're right, asking about someone's day and if they're ok is not an invitation to detailed injury or medical descriptions. And generally speaking, \"impulse blocking\" is a huge red flag in terms of communication and conflict resolution, so that's a yikes. \n\nThat said, you were far from perfect here either. Have a little empathy, she clearly had a traumatic experience and likely hadn't had someone to talk to about it. Even if it was too much for you, you can do better than just point blank hanging up when someone is describing something bad that happened. And seriously?

You saying \"she'll come around\" is giving her the okay to continue to be childish.  Screw that.  You both need to grow up.", "ESH. If she\u2019s your girlfriend then she should have been able to see how freaked out you were, but if you weren\u2019t ready to hear how her day went, then you shouldn\u2019t have asked.", "I am sensitive in this exact way. So I sympathize. When people want into something I won\u2019t be able to tolerate. I stop them. She snuck it up on you and your panicked. Just apologize. NAH", "NTA.
