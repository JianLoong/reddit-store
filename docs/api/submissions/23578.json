She absolutely seems...problematic, but one way to deal with people like this is to just stop dealing with them. And I don't mean no contact, I just mean that you stop thinking about them, you stop letting them bother you, and you stop worrying about them. \n\nGo to the wedding, sit wherever you want. Sit in the last row so you can be first out, when you walk in if you see someone you want to catch up with, sit with them! Go to the reception and eat all that free food! Take your shoes off and hit the dance floor! If it is lame, leave early, if it is a good time, stay till the party is over. You can have fun catching up with family and friends, all on your sister's dime. \n\nI see in the comments your parents are getting up in age, so spend time with them at the wedding, get lots of photos, bring them a slice of cake. This is your sister's wedding, but it is also a time to catch up and enjoy with other people, and by you having fun you aren't validating your sister's treatment of you, you are just having fun. \n\nThen take that energy to when you see her in other places. Don't start drama, don't let her get to you, do what you want, leave when you want, and see if you can come to a place where her petty comments don't bother you, and you can exist in the same space, for the sake of YOUR peace.\n\nThe saying \"living well is the best revenge\" is something I fully embrace. Just live your life and stop letting your sister ruin your energy.", "She wants to hurt you and you're letting her. You have different choices here\n\n1. don't go\n2. go and ask your parents to save place next to them \n3. go and sit somewhere in the middle\n4. sit at the back and then have her accuse you of doing it on purpose for attention.\n\nWhatever you choose, you two are not good for each other.", "INFO: Do you actually want to reconcile with your sister, or are you looking for revenge?", "Look it depends on what your optimal outcome is?  accordingly, you can behave... Your sister either really grew colder towards you after the remark, or she is being incredibly petty or she took you seriously when you expressed and showed that traditional wedding procedures are not your cup of tea. I can't really tell from this one story from your POV. I can tell you if you're petty you will continue this vicious cycle for sure , if not then you might stop it. I am not telling you which you should choose since it's entirely up to your expectations for the future which I don't know either :) I don't think this even registers on a AH scale", "If this is the whole story then... Yeah. I agree with what you said. She wanted to make your hen do about what she wanted and you said no and she pushed. Why?

It's possible you've never apologized for it to her satisfaction, or that it's not something that can be apologized away. You certainly seem at peace with it, breezily dismissing it as not your finest hour. OTOH, your sister sounds pretty insecure and annoyingly uptight, certainly calling you \"selfish\" for having the hen do you wanted rather than the kind she wanted, *for your wedding!*, doesn't speak highly of her and is less sympathetic than her hurt about a boyfriend comparing her to you unfavorably. Which you also breezily dismiss as something that's not on you, but if it made her resent you and be jealous of you, than it is a you problem. Yeah, she's petty to shunt you off to the back and make sure you fully feel, every step of the way, how unimportant you are, but it would seem her resentment of you is not just weirdly coming out of nowhere. I get why your husband doesn't like her, she doesn't sound likeable, but you don't seem too self-aware either. ESH.", "ESH. Your sister did forget that when you were getting married, the choices re: parties and so on were yours, as it was your wedding. She needed to be told to back off, and you could have done that. But what you said? Yeah, that was just mean AF, especially when you knew she had an ex say things like he wishes she was more like you. That latter part (what the ex said) wasn\u2019t your fault, but it would just make your remark to her even more cutting. I\u2019m not surprised she didn\u2019t text you a congratulations.\n\nAs for her wedding, yes, she\u2019s being petty, but I\u2019m hard-pressed to drum up a ton of sympathy, given that you were petty and mean first.

Don't give her that advantage. Enjoy the family you get to see, and don't fall into her set ups.\n\nBrides are super busy on their weddings, so interactions with her will be minimal. Just do enough so that she can't spin weird tales.\n\nFor example, talk to people before going into church just enough time so that some people have headed in and taken the aisle seats; and then slip a \"see you later, I'm heading in to get the best seats possible! It wasn't possible to reserve more and I know my sister will be so happy if I manage to get good ones for hubby and me!!\" Then pick some middle seats. You look like a good sister and have a good alibi. Worst case, people will comment to your sister \"what a pity it is that BRIDE couldn't reserve more seats, OP seemed so excited\"\n\n\\*Edited to make my last line clearer", "If you still want to go after all of this - which honestly, you are sounding like a doormat - then go to the wedding.  \n\nIf my sister treated me this way, I would do this:\n\nWhen you walk into the venue, very publicly (almost late) walk all the way to the front with your Hubby.  Look confused at the full seats. Catch the MIL's eye if you can, and stage whisper \"I can't believe he's still **willing** to marry her.\"  THEN walk all the way to the back.  Don't elaborate in any way.  If they ask, say, \"Oh, he didn't mention it? Sorry, I have to go\"  \n\nAt the reception, DANCE.  Have the time of your life.  If you see the photographer, try to be in as MANY shots as you can.  \n\nBut, I'm petty like that.  Luckily, my sister and I have a good relationship - also, she can out petty me in her sleep.

It's obvious she hasn't let go of past grudges and is just inviting you because she doesn't want to look bad. - NTA", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t suggest being petty and sitting at the back. Just because she\u2019s a small person doesn\u2019t mean you need to stoop to her level. \n\nFrom your side of the story it does sound like she is being petty but it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s so outright that it would be worth making a scene over it where you could be viewed as the bad guy. She wanted to be selfish about how you celebrated *your* wedding and it was a big enough deal for her to fall off with you over it and now it seems like she\u2019s punishing you for it. Sadly tho, it\u2019s her wedding now so you can\u2019t be selfish about how she wants to plan and celebrate it even if she is doing it to spite you. \nIt is also possible she hasn\u2019t included you just because she feels that you\u2019re not interested in a traditional ceremony/hens party etc. from the prior falling out you had. Either way it sounds like she has a history of belittling and attacking you, so maybe she\u2019s done you a favor by not including you. Don\u2019t make yourself look like the jealous/selfish bully here by sitting at the back or doing any of the mean things other people have commented. Don\u2019t give her a reason to make a big stink where she could twist this on you. \n\nGo to the wedding, get a seat in the third or fourth row, maybe the fifth if you\u2019re still feeling miffed, put on your happy face and let everyone know you\u2019re so excited to be there for your sisters big day. Congratulate her at the reception, and then going forward maybe it\u2019s time to slowly cut ties with her. If her treatment of you is a reoccurring issue (which I\u2019m assuming it is from the context you included and from what your husband thinks of her) then the real issue isn\u2019t just the wedding, it\u2019s her behavior towards you. If that\u2019s true then it\u2019s probably time to distance yourself. Just because you\u2019re sisters doesn\u2019t mean you have to be in each others lives. Honestly if it was me, I would\u2019ve been close to done with her over the selfish way she acted over your wedding, but to each their own.

I think you both sucked at that fight before your wedding. When you say you made up, can we assume you apologised for your words back then?\nRegardless of that fight - you made up and had a good relationship over the last few years. Her behaviour is petty at best, centre stage passive-agressive, and bordering on plain old mean.\n\nWhile I don't think that siblings need to be in the bridal party, her not inviting you to the hen do, and that ridiculous snide about \"try not to sit completely in the back though\" is planned and meant to hurt you. (Seriously, 4 seats to reserve is too much??)\nYou appear to have been very supportive of her plans and wanted to help. She chose violence.\n\nAnyhow. I'd say NTA if you just sit in the back. That's low level pettiness fighting a-holey behaviour.\n\nBut leaving after it and playing into her narrative will make you the bad guy. It seems she's just waiting for you to snap. Just completely ignore that and join the game.\n\nI'd sit backwards, tell her \"ah we were running a little late, not many seats were left.

Why would she want a person who isn't into weddings be a bridesmaid...and do wedding things?\n\nThe reservation of tables...that I can't figure out.\n\nSo yes, OP can sit where they want. But I don't see sis going out of her way to be petty....unless some new info comes out regarding the reserved table thing.", "No one was and that was really clearly communicated really early on. It was just me and my (now) husband and everyone was fine about it, no one was unaware that that was how it was going to be", "Exactly, apologies are not automatic repair and reverse guarantees that put everything back how it was. The sister can accept that OP is sorry for what she said, but that doesn\u2019t cure the hurt of what was a deliberately very cutting remark.", "I'll take that, I'm learning from this thread that I'm definitely not as self aware as I thought I was! I did spend a long time in long conversations with my sister once I'd apologised, I didn't just say sorry and move on, but it's true that she may just feel nothing would be enough. And maybe I shouldn't expect her to and just accept that that's how it is now.", "Fair take on the situation tbh, I'm aware we've both not been super nice to one another over the years but I just thought we'd gotten over the drama... Although here I am on Reddit describing drama so shows how self aware I am about our relationship..!", "OP\u2019s sister isn\u2019t being petty.  OP hates traditional weddings and would be the worst person to be a bridesmaid.", "I hadn't even thought of that possibility!! She definitely knows how to push my buttons and has set me up before (throwing family parties on dates she knows I can't go) so wouldn't be totally out of character. The high road sounds like a possible good bet to avoid the trap!", "Chef\u2019s kiss \ud83d\ude18", "I don't feel like I'll be a doormat if I go (classic doormat response?!?) but joking aside I just think I'll heed some advice from here and just enjoy myself. Dancing included!", "Thank you for this \ud83d\ude4f and yeah I feel like if my parents didn't get SO happy when we're all together I would have been backing away a long time ago. But yep I'll go, I'll smile, I'll genuinely enjoy seeing family and friends, and the pettiness can roll down the hill far away", "That's definitely his preference! My sister and my husband used to be friends before I met him so he's definitely done a 180", "Kill her with kindness is a good shout!", "I think I'll just try and attend as a \"normal\" attendee and leave it at that, my parents would be too upset if I didn't go I think", "Fair take!", "Thank you, I'm going to try and just enjoy the day and stay out of this drama headspace. As someone pointed out, the petty stuff only works if I let it get to me (and presumably vice versa if I'd retaliated in a petty way too!)", "I suppose that's fair, in my head I was thinking I'd be helping and participating because that's what we'd spoken about but if she's changed her mind then I guess I should accept that and just attend", "Appreciate this advice, will try to just relax about the whole thing!", "Refocusing my energy onto having a dance and a chat with friends and family, at this point, I think!", "I checked with the groom's brother and sisters and they have reserved seats at the front BUT I appreciate your take. I'm obviously thinking about it from my perspective and thinking it's deliberate but maybe you're right and my sister's just not even thought about it", "I'm thinking more now to just sit where I can and try and just refocus on the whole thing!", "I did have a wedding! And I do believe in them, I'm a huge supporter of love and celebrating love. To clarify about the hen do, I said I would have one but wanted it to be something I'd like, not afternoon tea, that was the issue, I didn't say I hated them and weddings! She knows that my wedding day was the best day of my life. But if I'm coming across a downer and an AH then that's your take and that's fair enough!", "Hen do is the UK term for bachelorette party", "Think I'll go and yeah sit where I sit, take it just as a day out with friends and family, and then maybe avoid situations where we could potentially be bad for one another", "I'll go for my parents and so she's got everyone there but going to refocus and just see it as a chance to have a good day out", "At this point I'd like to hear more of her side too because we talked over loads of things at length and in depth over the years to get back to a healthy point, which is why I feel a bit like where tf did this come from!", "No one came to our wedding, we eloped! Well communicated well in advance so everyone was fine about it. I see your point but I'm thinking now I'll just go and treat it like any other wedding and have fun!", "Also think about how enjoyable it would be to be petty and gaslight her if you didn\u2019t show up\u2026 \u201ci was totally there, you must have just not seen me all the way in the back\u201d.", "I agree! Just make her one of the people you don't care about.", "I think you'll find that people who aren't in the immediate family won't sit in the front row. I can't imagine that there won't be a spot for you and hubby next to your parents. \n\nAlso, NTA. Your sis seems like an absolute drama queen.", "If you feel like you're not wanted, I'd suggest not to go. If she doesn't want you at the front, then if your parents save you a seat and she sees you up at the front, from what you've said she'd have a pop at you for weaseling your way to the front. If she doesn't want you to be seen as immediate family there, then don't let yourself be seen that way. Either sit at the back and leave when you're ready, or don't go and if anyone asks why, simply say your sister didn't want you there and she made that very clear with her behaviour towards you.", "INFO:   What do you mean you *thought* you had reconciled?  Did the two of you sit down, talk it out and apologize to each other or did you just assume that because 5 years had gone by that you could just rug sweep the bad blood between you two?", "there's even possibility she wouldn't really care about you sitting in the back but your parent would instead, in that light it might be really better not to do it on purpose at least.", "EDIT: WRONG THREAD WHOOPS", "Very true, not everything can be healed but we really have been getting on well up til now, like staying over at one another's houses, having meals together etc", "I have a very up and down relationship with my older brother (only sibling), so I do get it. He and I are not on the same page a lot, but it is what it is - I totally understand feeling slighted, I probably would too. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s not a hill I would die on, and it would just keep the drama going.", "Eh, disagree. All the stuff about not having her as a bridesmaid or at the hen party, I agree that\u2019s not petty. The seating at the wedding, when she could easily be seated at the front with immediate family *is* petty.", "I'd definitely do this but don't just not show up tell your sister you're uncomfortable going because your husband doesn't want to go and congratulate her. Then I'd prolly block family for a bit till after cause people will probably be mad", "Let them be upset.  They should have smacked sense into your sister years ago.  You're just enabling them to coddle her.\n\nI would have agreed with your idea if you didn't bring up that line from your husband.  He's familiar with all the dynamics and the people, and he's saying don't go.", "She didn't attend your wedding, were your parents really upset about that?  If they weren't then you have a green light to not attend.  Sis is trying to slight you, I would not allow her to.  Do whatever you want to but I would be considering my hubby's feelings more than anyone else's .  Send best wishes and go on a date with your husband on her wedding day.", "And it sounds like you two have MASSIVELY different styles and you got nasty last time you two disagreed.  Why would she invite that stress in?", "You keep saying you don\u2019t want drama but you keep creating it for yourself. Mind your own business, it doesn\u2019t matter if all of the Teletubbies are in the front row and you aren\u2019t. You asked your sister, she said no you aren\u2019t in the front row. Stop pulling your parents and his siblings into this. Stop asking anyone. You have the final answer already now leave it be!", "If they have reserved seats I'd reach out to her to see why the difference in treatment between the bride's siblings and the groom's siblings.\n\nDepending on the answer make your decision. In the end, if you do decide to leave, you're the one choosing to leave your sister's wedding.\n\nMy gma used to say that you should never leave your bed after a fight with your partner because afterwards it's you who has to come back. This is the same. If you leave you're the one who'll have to show your face again in the next family gathering.", "Yes. That's what I said.", "I feel you, I had the same situation with my own sister years ago. We hashed out a lot and I thought we were better, but there was a lot she held on to that she never said. We\u2019re now just getting to a place where there is an acceptance and understanding of situations that happened in the past. It had surprised that things were brought up that I thought were resolved, but they weren\u2019t for her. I\u2019m not sure when the wedding is, so I don\u2019t know if there is a chance to hash this out before the wedding or not. Just as a side, I\u2019m petty when I\u2019m hurt, so I get it. If you do sit in the back, whatever narrative might be in her mind about you, will just be solidified if you do.", "You\u2019re right you did include that in your post, sorry.\nYou\u2019re very kind and light hearted. Don\u2019t let anyone take that away from you. I regret everything I wrote u_u.\n\nHugs and good vibes to you \u2665\ufe0f", "Good point, her colleague wouldn't race to the front I'd imagine? Very good point, probably worrying over nothing!", "We had multiple sit-downs and long conversations over the last few years, I didn't just say sorry and expect that to be that. I genuinely thought we'd reached a good place, I visit her, she stays here when she needs to visit the city, it seemed healed to me.", "Good shout, my parents would be upset and that's just not worth it AT ALL", "It could just be as simple as we're VERY different people I guess? Like opposites in so many ways. I think a conversation would 100% ignite an argument so would leave it til way after any important event. Thanks for the advice", "Yes but none of those activities involve the wedding you told her she\u2019d never have.", "Well, we do acknowledge she is a difficult person.", "Good advice, thank you!", "Tbh they still live together and my mum still cooks her food and everything so yeah coddled is right! And husband was friends with my sister before I met him so it really is her behaviour towards me that's made him dislike her... You've made fair points but I still am going to go, just not going to engage or think about the undercurrent drama", "No one attended my wedding other than me and the now husband! We made it clear way in advance that the day was for us and we'd be fully eloping and everyone was happy with our choice for ourselves. I think thanks to this comments section I'll just not buy a ticket to the drama and just go and have fun as a regular guest without getting involved in chair politics!", "Tbh fair enough - if I check out of it then it ceases to be drama doesn't it? Point taken", "I thought it was a question", "Thank you, I appreciate it \ud83d\ude4f", "Exactly. \n\nI've just been thinking about this more... I actually can't believe that your sis hasn't considered that your parents will want you sitting next to them for this important family occasion! Very weird behaviour on her part.", "Thank you for answering my questions.  Well, it seems that your sister may still be harboring some anger and resentment.", "Sorry about that. I thought this was a completely different thread cause I'm kinda tired. Sorry. Your sister seems rude. You're NTA. you can attend if you feel comfortable but personally I think not going is also an option. Sorry again", "EDIT: WRONG THREAD WHOOPS", "You are giving so much emotional energy to something you have no control over. Asking everyone where they are sitting and collecting evidence isn\u2019t going to change your sister\u2019s mind, especially when she gave you a clear answer. Obviously you don\u2019t like that answer but you have it and building a case to move isn\u2019t going to change her mind and will probably just annoy her and make you look gossipy. You can\u2019t control people\u2019s actions, only your reactions.", "No. I said \"hen do\" means \"bachelorette party\". \n\nBecause some people reading the original post might not know that.", "No worries! I'm genuinely looking for honest takes so if some people think I'm TA (or ESH) then I was prepared for that!"]}
