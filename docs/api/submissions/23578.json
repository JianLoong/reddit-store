She absolutely seems...problematic, but one way to deal with people like this is to just stop dealing with them. And I don't mean no contact, I just mean that you stop thinking about them, you stop letting them bother you, and you stop worrying about them. \n\nGo to the wedding, sit wherever you want. Sit in the last row so you can be first out, when you walk in if you see someone you want to catch up with, sit with them! Go to the reception and eat all that free food! Take your shoes off and hit the dance floor! If it is lame, leave early, if it is a good time, stay till the party is over. You can have fun catching up with family and friends, all on your sister's dime. \n\nI see in the comments your parents are getting up in age, so spend time with them at the wedding, get lots of photos, bring them a slice of cake. This is your sister's wedding, but it is also a time to catch up and enjoy with other people, and by you having fun you aren't validating your sister's treatment of you, you are just having fun. \n\nThen take that energy to when you see her in other places. Don't start drama, don't let her get to you, do what you want, leave when you want, and see if you can come to a place where her petty comments don't bother you, and you can exist in the same space, for the sake of YOUR peace.\n\nThe saying \"living well is the best revenge\" is something I fully embrace. Just live your life and stop letting your sister ruin your energy.", "She wants to hurt you and you're letting her. You have different choices here\n\n1. don't go\n2. go and ask your parents to save place next to them \n3. go and sit somewhere in the middle\n4. sit at the back and then have her accuse you of doing it on purpose for attention.\n\nWhatever you choose, you two are not good for each other.", "INFO: Do you actually want to reconcile with your sister, or are you looking for revenge?", "Look it depends on what your optimal outcome is?  accordingly, you can behave... Your sister either really grew colder towards you after the remark, or she is being incredibly petty or she took you seriously when you expressed and showed that traditional wedding procedures are not your cup of tea. I can't really tell from this one story from your POV. I can tell you if you're petty you will continue this vicious cycle for sure , if not then you might stop it. I am not telling you which you should choose since it's entirely up to your expectations for the future which I don't know either :) I don't think this even registers on a AH scale", "If this is the whole story then... Yeah. I agree with what you said. She wanted to make your hen do about what she wanted and you said no and she pushed. Why?

It's possible you've never apologized for it to her satisfaction, or that it's not something that can be apologized away. You certainly seem at peace with it, breezily dismissing it as not your finest hour. OTOH, your sister sounds pretty insecure and annoyingly uptight, certainly calling you \"selfish\" for having the hen do you wanted rather than the kind she wanted, *for your wedding!*, doesn't speak highly of her and is less sympathetic than her hurt about a boyfriend comparing her to you unfavorably. Which you also breezily dismiss as something that's not on you, but if it made her resent you and be jealous of you, than it is a you problem. Yeah, she's petty to shunt you off to the back and make sure you fully feel, every step of the way, how unimportant you are, but it would seem her resentment of you is not just weirdly coming out of nowhere. I get why your husband doesn't like her, she doesn't sound likeable, but you don't seem too self-aware either. ESH.", "ESH. Your sister did forget that when you were getting married, the choices re: parties and so on were yours, as it was your wedding. She needed to be told to back off, and you could have done that. But what you said? Yeah, that was just mean AF, especially when you knew she had an ex say things like he wishes she was more like you. That latter part (what the ex said) wasn\u2019t your fault, but it would just make your remark to her even more cutting. I\u2019m not surprised she didn\u2019t text you a congratulations.\n\nAs for her wedding, yes, she\u2019s being petty, but I\u2019m hard-pressed to drum up a ton of sympathy, given that you were petty and mean first.

Don't give her that advantage. Enjoy the family you get to see, and don't fall into her set ups.\n\nBrides are super busy on their weddings, so interactions with her will be minimal. Just do enough so that she can't spin weird tales.\n\nFor example, talk to people before going into church just enough time so that some people have headed in and taken the aisle seats; and then slip a \"see you later, I'm heading in to get the best seats possible! It wasn't possible to reserve more and I know my sister will be so happy if I manage to get good ones for hubby and me!!\" Then pick some middle seats. You look like a good sister and have a good alibi. Worst case, people will comment to your sister \"what a pity it is that BRIDE couldn't reserve more seats, OP seemed so excited\"\n\n\\*Edited to make my last line clearer", "If you still want to go after all of this - which honestly, you are sounding like a doormat - then go to the wedding.  \n\nIf my sister treated me this way, I would do this:\n\nWhen you walk into the venue, very publicly (almost late) walk all the way to the front with your Hubby.  Look confused at the full seats. Catch the MIL's eye if you can, and stage whisper \"I can't believe he's still **willing** to marry her.\"  THEN walk all the way to the back.  Don't elaborate in any way.  If they ask, say, \"Oh, he didn't mention it? Sorry, I have to go\"  \n\nAt the reception, DANCE.  Have the time of your life.  If you see the photographer, try to be in as MANY shots as you can.  \n\nBut, I'm petty like that.  Luckily, my sister and I have a good relationship - also, she can out petty me in her sleep.

It's obvious she hasn't let go of past grudges and is just inviting you because she doesn't want to look bad. - NTA", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t suggest being petty and sitting at the back. Just because she\u2019s a small person doesn\u2019t mean you need to stoop to her level. \n\nFrom your side of the story it does sound like she is being petty but it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s so outright that it would be worth making a scene over it where you could be viewed as the bad guy. She wanted to be selfish about how you celebrated *your* wedding and it was a big enough deal for her to fall off with you over it and now it seems like she\u2019s punishing you for it. Sadly tho, it\u2019s her wedding now so you can\u2019t be selfish about how she wants to plan and celebrate it even if she is doing it to spite you. \nIt is also possible she hasn\u2019t included you just because she feels that you\u2019re not interested in a traditional ceremony/hens party etc. from the prior falling out you had. Either way it sounds like she has a history of belittling and attacking you, so maybe she\u2019s done you a favor by not including you. Don\u2019t make yourself look like the jealous/selfish bully here by sitting at the back or doing any of the mean things other people have commented. Don\u2019t give her a reason to make a big stink where she could twist this on you. \n\nGo to the wedding, get a seat in the third or fourth row, maybe the fifth if you\u2019re still feeling miffed, put on your happy face and let everyone know you\u2019re so excited to be there for your sisters big day. Congratulate her at the reception, and then going forward maybe it\u2019s time to slowly cut ties with her. If her treatment of you is a reoccurring issue (which I\u2019m assuming it is from the context you included and from what your husband thinks of her) then the real issue isn\u2019t just the wedding, it\u2019s her behavior towards you. If that\u2019s true then it\u2019s probably time to distance yourself. Just because you\u2019re sisters doesn\u2019t mean you have to be in each others lives. Honestly if it was me, I would\u2019ve been close to done with her over the selfish way she acted over your wedding, but to each their own.

I think you both sucked at that fight before your wedding. When you say you made up, can we assume you apologised for your words back then?\nRegardless of that fight - you made up and had a good relationship over the last few years. Her behaviour is petty at best, centre stage passive-agressive, and bordering on plain old mean.\n\nWhile I don't think that siblings need to be in the bridal party, her not inviting you to the hen do, and that ridiculous snide about \"try not to sit completely in the back though\" is planned and meant to hurt you. (Seriously, 4 seats to reserve is too much??)\nYou appear to have been very supportive of her plans and wanted to help. She chose violence.\n\nAnyhow. I'd say NTA if you just sit in the back. That's low level pettiness fighting a-holey behaviour.\n\nBut leaving after it and playing into her narrative will make you the bad guy. It seems she's just waiting for you to snap. Just completely ignore that and join the game.\n\nI'd sit backwards, tell her \"ah we were running a little late, not many seats were left.
