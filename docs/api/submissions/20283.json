Too many managers out there are just terrible at overseeing people; they're put in their roles because there's nowhere else for them to go in their area of expertise. Well managed companies have at least two tracks for senior employees - one for those who don't have much more room to grow but aren't interested in - or aren't qualified to - manage employees and one for those who *are* qualified and interested in managing employees. Smaller companies usually don't have the luxury of creating separate silos like this, unfortunately, and this is where the most egregious behaviors take place.", "Most companies are in a \u201cright to work\u201d state, meaning they can fire you for any reason or for no reason. It also means that you can leave at any time for any reason or for no reason.", "Damn. I work a side gig at a local church two days a week and the minister gives me a $50 Amazon gift card every Christmas. In my circumstance it's unexpected and very appreciated. In yours? Yeah, management can get fucked.", "Not exactly, friend. Removing the frame because it looks unprofessional isn't the same as forbidding the employee from discussing their pay. From the information provided, OP wasn't told not to disclose or discuss his/her pay, only to remove the frame. Companies are absolutely permitted to decide what types of items can be displayed on desks. That said, if other employees were allowed to display photographs or other documents (i.e., diplomas) in frames on their desks, OP could make a complaint to their state's EEOC. Whether it would go anywhere is highly unlikely unless the employer was already on their labor department's radar.\n\nETA: Btw, in the US, all employees are covered by the NLRA. Federal law almost always supercedes state law. (I say \"almost\" because I'm reminded of situations like states legalizing marijuana. Technically, it's still illegal at the federal level but states that have legalized it are actively refusing to enforce federal law in that case. So, I'm not comfortable making an absolute statement like \"always\" but, generally speaking, it's true.)", "That's really the only way. LOL!", "This is a company that's thinking seriously about retention and being proactive in making sure turnover remains as low as possible. This is so basic that it's just ridiculous so many companies dig in their heels and refuse to treat employees with the bare minimum of respect. I think it's safe to say that most of us reading and commenting here would rather have nothing than a $50 gift card or a plastic baggie filled with cheap crap that aligns with stupid puns (\"you rock\"). It's as if they're rewarding elementary school kids because even middle schoolers would prefer money. LOL!", "Man, I wish I could refute this but I'd be laughed off Reddit. It makes me sick, frankly.", "ISWYDT, smooth.", "TIL I learned both of those facts.", "I agree. They gave him the bonus. Why shouldn't he display what they gave him?  Are they embarrassed by it?  Because that's what their reaction says to me.", "It's going to fuck up their accounting! /s", "Or glued to the (probably more expensive) frame if you\u2019re feeling crafty!", "Or glue them to the frame as decoration.", "How many slices of motivational pizza does that cover?", "It does its called wrongful firing they can't fire you over a simple picture of a framed bill with 0 context they also can't fire him for discussing wages as I previously stated that's protected under the NLRA or National Labor Relations Act of 1935", "Then put away the frame, get a happy meal box, slice off a portion to reflect the difference between $5.34 and whatever the price of an happy meal is and voil\u00e0, you have beautiful desk art, a real conversation starter!", "I'm inclined to agree with you that most will find it tacky, but I'm probably in the very very small fraction of a percent that wouldn't care. I'd be too busy doing my own thing working to probably even take notice.", "There's a system that clearly designed to make sure you fail. Such as KPI OP's boss were using.

Just reading that made my toes curl. I can only imagine how that HR rep felt, hearing it in real time. Yikes!", "The comment comes from an old story with my Dad. He was pretty sure he was going to have to replace my Mom's laptop 10 years ago, and I told him to give me one last go at it. I fixed it and he said, \"I feel like I should renumerate you.\"\n\nI said, \"You mean remunerate. Renumerating me would be carving a different number into my forehead.\"\n\nAnd I said that because he, some ten years before that, had gotten a long vertical cut on his forehead. It wasn't severe but it was very bright red and impossible to miss. He said, \"When people at work ask me what happened, I'm going to say, 'You mean they didn't tell you? The job is giving us all numbers. I'm number one.'\"", "I love this idea but I think OP would be shooting himself in the foot. If he's looking to leave, it's better not to have them angry at him and relieved he's gone. To really stick it to them, he should maintain the level of professionalism and output that just garnered him that stellar performance review, find another job, and then be painfully honest when providing his resignation. Let them feel the burn of having chased away a great employee and see if they can replace him for the same salary (odds are they can't) plus the cost of training and getting someone up to speed (it's generally understood that most office positions have a 6-month learning curve; C-suite execs won't need that long for their overall job but they'll still need time to learn and understand the company culture and it doesn't happen in a couple of weeks, that's for sure). \n\nThat said, I'd never fault OP if he told them to go fuck themselves; he just needs to be ready to walk out the door. Either way, he leaves them in the lurch. If he does the middle ground option of slowing output and not caring about the job, they'll just be anxious to get rid of him.", "I see what you did thar!", "I've seen what you done there, smooth.", "And everytime the boss comes in to complain, just sit there and polish them.", "Two words: fairy lights.
