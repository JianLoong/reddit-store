Exceptions for those who are unable to function in society at all - but tactless comments made by someone who with 30 seconds of conversation you can tell does not grasp the concept of rudeness doesn't feel the same, so barely classes as rude.\n\nThe truth is likely to be that she is rude because nobody has ever corrected this behavior. Parents probably did not correct it in childhood because parenting someone with autism can be hard and requires a more attentive and reasoned approach.\n\nShe now has an object lesson in both what happens when she is rude, and what someone being rude feels like to the injured party.

I can say that I have read enough stories where people who are just being assholes and speaking without a filter defend themselves by saying they're autistic, but I have to say... as the mom of two children diagnosed on the spectrum... autism does not equal asshole.\n\nNow, it's possible that someone with autism is raised by someone who never bothered to teach them social norms or anything like that and just told the people around them \"they're autistic\" like it was some kind of shield against society.  And that's BS.\n\nAutistic people capable of conversing are capable of learning societal norms and are capable of learning rules and are capable of understanding that it's not kind to hurt people's feelings or talk about certain things.

I can say the wrong thing because I dont register that it is hurtfull, but that is because I dont see it as hurtfull and therefor wouldnt have reacted if someone told me the same thing (given that it was accurate). This have caused me challenges, both because I might not realize that I'm committing a social faux pa, but also because when people try to hurt me by saying similare things back, I'm mostly confused if it isnt accurate or true, or I dont even realize that it is an attempt at hurting my feelings because yeah thats accurate. \n\nIf SIL is hurt by being called the same thing she calls others, she is aware that it is hurtfull. The social implication of it doesnt go over her head, she knows it hurts peoples feelings. She is then still making the choise to say it.

My brother got married a few years ago to Shelly. She is the type of person that will say something rude and then when someone points it out, tell everyone it is true so what\u2019s the harm. \n\nMy mother despised her and actually opts out of most events just to avoid her. I moved back home about a year ago and at the time I thought people were just being rude to her or overblowing the things she says. I was wrong.\n\nMy first proper introduction to her she told me my outfit looked bad on me and it wasn\u2019t hiding my stomach. I give a present to a birthday party and she tells me I am cheap. ( I got a bubble gun for a 5 year old, he loved it) This goes on and on.\n\nI talked to my brother and he told me she is autistic and she can\u2019t help it. I then talked to her and I told her I won\u2019t put up with her being rude.\n\nNow it\u2019s my sons third birthday and I invite the family ( I wouldn\u2019t have invited her but I don\u2019t want to cause waves). She made a comment about my house decor, I told her it was rude and to knock it off. \n\nI lost it when I gave my son a piece of cake she made the comment that I shouldn\u2019t give him any since he looks fat. I told her to apologize and she told me it was the truth.\n\nI told her that she is overweight, that if she took care of herself more she wouldn\u2019t be fat, that this was the truth and she it rotten on the inside and her looks are just as bad.\n\nShe ending up crying and leaving. My brother is pissed and I was called some fun names. Everyone is torn if I should apologize or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is vitally important to differentiate the two. Eviscerated is a bit of an overstatement, it was barely an escalation on what SIL had said, and it was a single incident, not repeated bad behavior.\n\nThis response came after many attacks upon OP. If you believe that turn the other cheek is a viable strategy yo live by I will respect your opinion, but I don't share it.", "nope i did. i think you\u2019re wrong and it\u2019s okay to agree to disagree. people have talked about this before with her and no one wants to be around her. it was wrong but effective way to get her to back off. i\u2019m not condoning this behavior but maybe she will see that it\u2019s not right to call anyone that now that she\u2019s been called fat. i\u2019m sure if it was another situation something else would be said. people have told her to knock it off and she won\u2019t. now whose fault is that? she brought this upon herself.\n\nedit: \nHi fun fact for you! \nWasn\u2019t me and i simply don\u2019t care. i have things to do and i don\u2019t need to sit on my phone and argue with someone who essentially condones fat shaming a 3 yr old. you are looking at everything other than what i was talking about. have a day you deserve tho! \nleave me out of your thoughts tho\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "It also just feels good sometimes to hurt people who hurt you and luckily in this case for OP it's entirely justified. Who the fuck fat shames a 3yr old on his birthday?!?", "They asked if they were an AH, I think they both were and I explained why. This is not an advice sub, it's a judgement sub. I don't care what they should do, I just know that what both parties did was shitty.", "Do you honestly think insult-for-insult is going to be an effective strategy against an autistic bully?", "\u201cYou\u2019re fat and ugly\u201d is not shaming her behavior, it\u2019s just being an asshole. And it\u2019s going to accomplish nothing except showing her that you can be an asshole too.", "I doubt it. Would be interesting to get an update from OP in a years time or so.", "Yeah if she had said \"your outfit is showing your stomach\" and stopped at that, ok factual and so something an autistic person would point out without assigning negative or positive value to this observation.\n\nBut SIL goes onto to say \"outfit looks BAD\" \"your kid is FAT\". Those are both negative statements and don't fall into the whole I'm-autistic-and-this-is-just-me-being-blunt-and-lacking-awarness-of-social-cues-and-nuance. Nothing nuanced about calling a child FAT.\n\nI do think that SIL deserves some grace when it comes to her autism. Especially as typically women with autism tend to hide it better than men. So she could be struggling with a more severe case she is able to mask. But its not Op's responsibility to cater to SIL when her words are directly impacting and damaging Op's children.", "He really didn't. It was brutal. Granted, Opie did brutal things too, but he was a good guy. I kept hoping someone was coming to save him.", "I got this.", "I cry every time I watch it. He deserved so much better.", "That was one of the hardest scenes to watch.", "I met the actor last year and he is a total sweetheart too. Called me sweetheart and talked to my kids for a few minutes.", "SOA ?", "Thanks for the spoilers >:(", "Yea I was never good at listening to others. I hope it becomes the new term. Opie > op", "I don't think we ever will be. Jax's death didn't even bother me like Opie's.", "OP held her tongue until she attacked her son. All gloves are off at that point.", "It clearly had a short term effect in a way none of the more polite efforts had. She may learn from it this time. Autistic does not mean dumb or lacking control. This woman is using her autism as an excuse to be rude, knowing full well she's doing it because she's been told she's doing it. I'm all for giving neurodivergent people leeway to be who they are but that doesn't mean they can live completely outside of societal boundaries once their behavior start impacting others in a negative way.", "She hasn't bothered to learn boundaries which autistic people are able to do.  Maybe getting her face rubbed in her own shit will help her achieve what so many others can do.", "wanna bet ?  you got no idea how much it can help to be petty against such spoiled people ....lol", "Nah that's the hypocrisy part I mentioned.", "hey , sometimes you need to step down to their level to make them realise their behaviour is bad ......\n\nOP has told her multiple times to stop and she cant be an adult to stop with comments", "that was part of it for me, too. i wanted him to be redeemed SO BAD.", "Sons of Anarchy.", "Of course. I don't think I've ever had a fictional death hit me so hard.", "Sword Online Art.", "He kind of was with his death. He was basically suicidal anyway, but he went out like a boss, for his brothers. I would marry a real life Opie. But I don't have a moral compass either so...", "Gracias!", "Andy Griffith", "She's not handing out truths here; she's throwing out her negative opinions. Blaming this shit on autism is an AH move in itself.....!!", "De nada"]}
