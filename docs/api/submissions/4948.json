Me and my brother have a great\nrelationship. Tho he's always been allowed to go out to\nparties, visit friends, go with family to do stuff, and have\nhis gf over for weeks when I wasnt.\n\nWhen I turned 18 someone else threw me a birthday\nparty cause my parents couldn't afford it which is fine, I\nget that. A few months later my brother turned 17. They\nasked him what he wants and he said he doesn't know\ncause 17 isn't that special and it's between sweet 16\nand turning 18. I then thought about my 1 8th and came\nto a realization, my parents never got me anything for\nmy birthday told my brother and he then realized as well. He hammered on my mom for not getting me anything and she said she'll talk to my dad about it. I went to show my parents what l'm getting for my brother and then they showed me what they're getting for him. His gift was worth $2400. I felt my heart burst.\n\nMy dad got drunk and came to talk to me about how\nupset he was when my mom brought up the no birthday\ngift. He went on about how none of us understood\nhow bad it was for him to struggle and how he didnt\nknow how to support us (even tho I offered to pay for\nstuff he never took it). He then said that he didn't ge\nme anything cause he couldn't and he got my brother\nsomething because he could afford it. My love language\nis gift giving and honestly him making me a birthday\ncard or just picking flowers out of my own garden\nvould've meant the world to me. My brother gave me\na gift months later cause he could and I was over the\nmoon cause of it. Idc if it's on the same day or if it`s a\nyear late. ldc if it's worth $10000 or $1. I just wanted\nsomething, but I left it.\n\nNow it's Christmas and I thought they would get me a\ngift worth $100. To me it was a lot of money and when\nI was looking for something I accidentally found it. I've\nbeen wanting it for a year+ and I felt heard for the first\ntime ever. 2 days later they open the thing in front of\nme. My parents gave a speech about how it's not right\ngiving me something like this when they also would like\nto use it and decided on getting it for the house instead\nThey knew I wanted it. They took one look at me and\npasically said, we know you want this but after the yea\nof you begging for it we kinda want it too so now it's\nours lol love you\n\nMy heart shattered. I talked to my cousin about this.\nShe said I was acting spoiled/entitled and that I should\nbe more understanding of my parents' situation. I felt\nso guilty for talking about it. I never wanted to sound\nspoiled I just wanted to feel loved ig. I just wanted to\nfeel like what I want was also considered for the first\ntime in my entire life\n\nSO AITA for being upset and crushed about this?

That's some high level psychological b.s. they're pulling on you, and it ain't right. \n\nYou need to emancipate yourself as soon as you can.

Your parents are gas lighting you. You should DNA test to see if your father is actually your father. Just weird. I find it to be very crappy that they go out of their way for your brother but are pulling this nonsense on you. I would never do something like this to either of my kids. I plan ahead and set aside or buy when I do have if money is going to be tight.

What gets me is the age thing.  You are an adult now.  If they haven't given you gifts yet, when were they thinking of starting?  When you graduate college?  When you get married?

As you are 18, its time to pick yourself up, move on with your life and hopefully there will be a lady who will come into your life who will fill up for all those voids that's left by your parents. Also 'never forget' what you went through as I am sure in a few decades the tables will turn and your parents will be asking you for things.
