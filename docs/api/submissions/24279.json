There's no \"trust\" to be rebuilt here. What she did violated *LAWS*!  Just because you \"don't believe\" she did, doesn't mean you're positive she didn't! Does the program had a tracker? Can you go in and see what was actually accessed? The Medical program my husband's company uses logs *every* single page accessed for security reasons.

If it was auto logged out then how was she able to get to that point without having access to your pin/passcode?", "If she had his phone password and he relies on having a password on the phone only she could get in, just like people venmo themselves money from someone else's account", "All sexually active people should be tested for STD's. It's not evidence of cheating, it should be part of a yearly physical.\n\nYour girlfriend had no right to look into his medical file by accessing your log in info. Going forward keep that to yourself and guard it with your life. I don't know if I could move forward with someone who jeopardized my career like that. She must know that it violates the oath that you take. I would be rethinking the entire relationship.", "Mostly NTA. You made a boo-boo not securing a device with PHI. I\u2019m a nurse, and my access to our hospital system on my phone is double password protected. My husband can have my phone all he wants, but he can\u2019t get into the hospital stuff. If he could, he wouldn\u2019t get the phone. And I really don\u2019t think he would do that. A. He\u2019s ethical. B. He knows my job is needed to pay our bills, and he\u2019s not dumb enough to downgrade our lifestyle.  Your fianc\u00e9e is untrustworthy and not very bright. If it were me, I probably wouldn\u2019t marry her anytime soon. She\u2019s the biggest AH, while you relearned the lesson most of us learned back in school before we were licensed and set loose with PHI.", "Where's the original post?", "Good, I re-read everything.\n\nGlad that she wasn't able to access anything. Still, you got lucky. Take this as a learning experience and move forward.\n\nIf the relationship can be salvaged in your perspective, ensure she gets an education on what would have happened had she been successful. Invite her into HR if all parties are willing, if any good can come out of it, it's through growth and education for future use. Plus HR might get you brownie points for this act, as it shows you're going double-down in seriousness for data security.\n\nSome people legitimately do not understand the scope of importance for medical confidentiality, and ultimately I do have sympathy in that regard, to a point. She's reached it and how she acts going forward will be a good gauge on the matter.", "Anyone have the text of the original post?", "OMG. Absolutely NTA. Not only did she violate your trust, but she out your whole career in jeopardy. Even with a \u2018no secrets\u2019 pact, that only applies to personal stuff, not HIPA privacy-protected data."]}
