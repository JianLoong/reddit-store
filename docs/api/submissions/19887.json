YTA. I think counseling is needed more than a locked door, in my opinion. You\u2019re being neglected in your relationship and retaliated by purposefully exchanging a door that lets you walk in on your wife during her office time when she might need the privacy. Why does she feel the need to stay away from you? Ask yourself that.  ~~But she\u2019s ignoring the fact that there\u2019s a serious issue if she would rather spend her time behind a locked door than with her husband.~~\n\nETA: after reading your responses to several of the comments, YTA.", "ESH\n\nThere is a much bigger problem going on if your wife is hiding from you and not wanting to speak with you.

Also she's telling you to spend time with her friends? That's odd.", "YTA.

There\u2019s a reason and that\u2019s what needs to be addressed. I despise people barging into my office when I\u2019m working. It\u2019s disruptive and disrespectful. If she\u2019s not answering, then let her be. If you\u2019re incompatible, then address that.", "YTA\n\nAs someone who needs privacy for work, is an avid reader and is not particularly sociable, it can be so exhausting to be involved with someone like you. It feels like we have to be ON all the time.\n\nMy SO and I love each other and can spend most of the day in the same house, doing whatever we need or want to do, and still only spend an hour or so with each other. And we're fine with this, because we are both, at heart, loners and pretty self-sufficient when it comes to keeping ourselves entertained. We don't consider it a rejection if the other is reading in another room, or playing a game, or just contemplating the universe. \n\nThe pandemic lockdowns were hell for those who always socialized.

Dance, monkey, dance.\n\nKate works by herself and likes to immerse herself in books. When she would sit in your lap to read did you allow her to get lost in the book? Or did you pester her by constantly touching her or talking to her?\n\nKate can entertain herself. You? Maybe not so much. You're the social butterfly. She has a few select friends. You're friends with *everyone*, including all her friends and even her boss. You have invaded every corner of her existence and have now taken away her sanctuary.

Read a few of your comments. Sounds like she works a lot since she\u2019s picking up the load for all her shitty coworkers and boss, that dump the work on her. Example, people decided to go to happy hour and your wife couldn\u2019t go since a lot of work got dumped on her. Or her boss would retire early if everyone was like your wife. Yet you\u2019re friends with all of them. I would lock my door too, since you\u2019re chummy with the enemy. I would feel like I have no allies, if all I do is work, take care of most bills, and my husband is just friends with all my coworkers, so that I\u2019m trapped at a terrible job.", "YTA. You're avoiding a conversation you need to have with her. Instead exerting control over her by taking the lock out of the door. It seems passive aggressive.", "YTA. The correct way to address this is to communicate openly with your wife about how her behavior makes you feel and try to figure out what's a better arrangement for you both. Your wife is clearly more comfortable in her own space without interacting with you. That's a serious problem. If there's an insurmountable breakdown in the relationship, it probably means it's time to initiate separation and divorce proceedings.\n\nThis move seems passive aggressive instead and I don't see how it addresses the core problem.\n\nOut of curiosity, how does a door \"wear out\"?", "It's definitely weird for your wife to lock herself away in the house! I really can't call you the AH since her distance seems odd as you described it.  I can only suggest since you're obviously unhappy with the situation (I would be too) that y'all try some counseling to figure out what you each want from this relationship, and where you all think boundaries of whatever sort should be.  NTA.", "Bro. Therapy. Communication. Don't just keep repeating the same excuses. You seem like you are being deliberately obtuse and won't accept any answer you don't like.", "I think the fact that your wife feels the need to isolate herself completely at every opportunity is worrying- is she depressed? I think you need to sit down with her and have an honest conversation- something's not right.", "YTA\n\nWriting on the wall being that your marriage is taking a detour for the worse, what are you planning to accomplish with this move? More than that, what did you even imagine would have happened? Your wife ignores you, but your reaction is akin to a child who repeatedly screams \u2018mom\u2019 louder each time. \n\nIf this is the way both of you resolve your issues, with your wife cutting herself off and you forcefully breaking yourself in; I would strongly suggest a marriage counselling or a divorce lawyer.\n\nEDIT/S: Grammar.", "Op it kind of sounds like you were suffocating her a little she may be feeling trapped and her way of dealing is being able to lock you out. Honestly you're TA for doing what you did. But also you're isolating her wether you realize it or not and yats toxic dude she doesn't have anyone you don't know that she can talk or vent to about y'alls marriage without maybe \"making you look bad\" and women are ingrained from day one to coddle dudes and their feelings so ergo she wouldn't feel like she could voice any I'll feelings with anyone....are you picking up what I'm putting down.\nAlso, I'm with everyone else on here, COMMUNICATE! And I mean more then just hey honey, I don't like that you lock your office door etc etc...more cuz saying vague things doesn't tell anyone anything you're an adult, use your words!", "ESH. You two need to sit down and talk this out. Get both of your feelings out into the open and work through them.", "Info: do you have friends of your own? I\u2019m not saying this to be rude but how often where you guys spending together before?", "If your wife is isoliting herself, forcing yourself on her is maybe not the best path to take. \n\nYou are not an AH, but a little clueless when it comes to problem solving. You need to have a serious discussion with your wife, with or w/o professional help.", "YTA. Your wife is intentionally trying to have privacy and you knowing took that away from her, as if it isn't a right she has. \n\nDon't be controlling. Even if you don't like what she's doing, that doesn't change her right to do it and doesn't give you the right to force her. If anything, you are making things worse.", "YTA for doing this instead of addressing the actual problem. Removing the door lock will just make her feel like you don\u2019t trust her or can\u2019t respect her need for space.\n\nI empathise. It sounds like something major is happening and you don\u2019t know what else to do. Is she open to counselling? Individual and couples? If this is a change in behaviour, you need to be more worried about your wife than about trying to force her to spend time with you.", "Going to go INFO here, as this feels like a symptom of a bigger problem. Why does she feel the need to spend large portions of her day avoiding you? Has she grown to dislike you, but not to the point of divorce, and you haven't noticed? Punishment for some perceived sleight? Scared of you for some reason? I don't really expect you to answer, as you wouldn't know the answers to these questions, or be trusted to be honest for the last one.\n\nSolely going on available information, E S H. Locking herself away without even a way for emergency contact should be either a last resort, or for specific situations. But taking away her ability to do so is too controlling in my opinion. Not making it my judgment as the reason could tilt the scales either way. Discuss it with her, and if that fails, seek professional help.", "yta. maybe she locks her self in cause that is the only way sue gets to be alone with out you barging in like the kool-aid man. you've already barged in her work life. like don't you have a job or friends or even hobbies that you can spend time doing instead of bugging your wife like a lost puppy. her work is her work stop meddling and pushing yourself into her work life. hanging out with her boss and coworkers without her is just weird. have you ever thought that all here happy hours the coworkers work getspushedonto your wife", "INFO: How long has this been going on? What happened around that time? How does a door get worn out? Before this, did you repeatedly interrupt her while she was busy?", "Your problems have nothing to do with a lock on the door - surely you can see that?", "Changing the door was a childish passive-aggressive move. So YTA for that. \n\nBut it clearly sounds like something much bigger is going on here. You need to have a real in-depth and honest conversation with your wife, tell her how you feel about she\u2019s avoiding you. Might be painful, but you need this talk instead of getting passive-aggressive about it. If you can\u2018t manage that in-depth talk yourself consider couples counseling.", "YTA.\n\n\"Kate\u2019s door is always locked when she\u2019s reading or working.

Come on, you knew she wasn't going to like that and you did it anyway.  Maybe instead of trying to prevent her from being able to escape you try to find out why she wants to escape you and if there's some way to fix that?", "NTA she can still use a door stopper and you have the right to disagree to her locking herself up all the time. Though, you need to act more mature here, sit down with her and have a talk to communicate to her how much of isolating each other is acceptable to you. Make sure you tell her what are your minimum levels of shared time and activities, make sure to propose ideas to her, invite her to things, ask her to spend time with you. If you will be actively asking and proposing and she will reject over a longer period of time, then you know you have a bigger relationship problem.", "This is tough, OP.\n\nI think you should replace with a door that does have a locking knob. Sometimes wives need that time alone to focus and be productive on their own. \n\nThat just might be her only place to really decompress and relax. Please don\u2019t take that from her because you may end up regretting it. I totally understand your perspective, but this situation isn\u2019t about you unfortunately. It\u2019s about respecting your wife\u2019s need for privacy and being able to be alone for a while.\n\nIf you finish doing something for her, just shoot her a message and let her know.

If it\u2019s true that you barely see your wife for an hour a day and every time you try to address it she dismissed your concerns and tells you to go hang with anyone else. That would be absolutely fine every now and then but if this is every single day outside of work as well then she is neglecting the marriage. She does not want to spend time with you.

SOMETHING HAPPENED. Whether she\u2019s lost love for you, cheated, hurt by something you did, depressed or whatever else, something has happened to change the relationship. Stop forcing yourself into her space, take her for couples therapy or your marriage is over. A lot of these comments aren\u2019t getting the fact that your wife is neglecting the marriage. You don\u2019t get married then lock yourself away from your partner and refuse to communicate why.

Your wife probably only feels like a friendship broker for you. You are friends with HER boss, colleagues and friends. Do you know how weird that sounds?

Go to counselling.", "YTA. From experience as someone that has been in your wife's position I can say:\n\n1. You need to back off. People need time and space to recharge, *even* from their spouses. Is she an introvert? Then that's doubly the case. Most people need alone time away from anyone. \n\n2. Please let your wife have her own friends and find some of your own disconnected from her life. It probably feels to her like *every* social interaction she has, has to include you, meaning she has no space to be a person away from you.\n\n3. Your wife will recover, but she needs time and if she knows what's good for her she'll never let it get this bad again, but you both *need* to figure out where the boundaries are and *keep to them*. Right now the only thing she needs is time **away**, but in the future propose relationship counselling to figure out what the right balance is for both of you.\n\n4. Accept that this may lead to divorce. People have different needs, and this situation may not be healthy for either of you. You should honestly both get therapy individually to figure that out.\n\nMy \"\"stalker\"\" (as I've taken to calling him after going NC) threatened to kill himself over me taking space away from him, and in the years since I've dealt with depression, anxiety and PTSD from that whole situation.

You discussed the replacement with her, and honestly it was a sensible decision for safety reasons. Relying on a door lock that might break down is unwise in the case of an emergency, so you chose a door with a non-locking knob. Your wife\u2019s annoyance in this case is understandable, but not wholly warranted.", "This might just be me, but I think it's pretty odd to lock a door just to work or read. I can just about understand it for a bathroom but even then when it's just a married couple together, it doesn't make much sense. \n\nWe don't lock any doors - if one of us wants some space, we'd just say so. \"Hey, I'm gonna read this book\" or \"I want to do some writing and need to focus\". \n\nWe use headphones in our office / behind the computers to be considerate to one another. Ditto when using a tablet or mobile phone. \n\nThe only situation where it generally even comes up is if one of us is watching TV. But even then there are solutions by just communicating your needs/want/feelings. \n\nIt feels like more is going on here. I don't know your wife at all, so I don't want to unfairly judge her. You also said she leaves her phone behind - so she creates a situation where she cannot be contacted at all. \n\nInstinctively, you'd first think she's doing something which she doesn't want you to know about - but this feels a little different. You need to talk to her and find out where this desire is coming from. It makes no sense for just reading a book. She's completely locking herself away both physically and mentally, with no way at all to contact her. That's not normal, regardless of where it takes place and that's even ignoring that it's disrespectful and concerning for loved ones.  It also doesn't help create a healthy relationship..\n\nThis is likely coming from somewhere else and she might genuinely need support and help to deal with it. \n\nOverall, NTA. People who have judged otherwise have misunderstood or failed to read what you wrote about the door - it wasn't replaced out spite or pettyness, but because it needed to be replaced. I'm assuming she wanted it replacing, but would have preferred another lock. \n\nThat room doesn't need a lock, it's not a bathroom and you're not keeping any state secrets there. Privacy is handled via respect and communication.", "NTA but it does t sound like a marriage it sounds like you are roommates. Was she always like this  or is it recent.

You're currently leaning towards the second with a side of her \"owing you\" attention.\n\nYou mentioned that she used to spend a lot of time with you.\n\nUnfortunately, the way it works is that if someone spends just a bit too much energy on a social interaction, let's say per day, that means the next day you have a bit less energy to spend. If you keep that up it builds up like debt into an insurmountable feeling of \"too much\"\n\nRight now she first needs to get rid of the debt, before she can start spending more.\n\nOf course, this is not fun to you at all. Your feelings are also valid in all this, but there is some mismatch in needs going on that you need to figure out. **You might never go back to your previous normal if you stay with her**. \n\nWhen she's rested she will want to keep some more boundaries than before. \n\nSo think about what you need and whether knowing that your wife needs less time with you could be a dealbreaker. It's a good start to tone down the friendships with her colleagues, but please understand *why* you're doing that. None of this is going to be an easy fix, it's definitely going to take time, and your wife will need to be conscious of the \"why\" as well. That's where the therapy comes in, because (again, from experience) the avoidance usually comes before the realization about *what* is wrong.\n\nThe problem here is: **you can't force this**. Your wife's health and both of your happiness will need to come before the relationship. \n\nSpeak to your wife about her mental health, say that you understand that she needs time apart. Try not to mention your own needs and wants for that first conversation, keep those for therapy or a future conversation. You need to make it clear that you're willing to work with her to help her. Put a lock on her door to show her that you mean it. If it makes you feel better you can compromise with a thinner door that you could kick through in an emergency, but the lock is non-negotiable.\n\nWhen you do mention your needs and wants at some point in the future, do it with the knowledge that you might need to compromise.

I got so bored and annoyed my husband so much because every second he wasn't working I wanted to hang out. So he told me he was feeling smothered being my whole social outlet and I got a job.
