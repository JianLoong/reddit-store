I think counseling is needed more than a locked door, in my opinion. You\u2019re being neglected in your relationship and retaliated by purposefully exchanging a door that lets you walk in on your wife during her office time when she might need the privacy. But she\u2019s ignoring the fact that there\u2019s a serious issue if she would rather spend her time behind a locked door than with her husband.", "ESH\n\nThere is a much bigger problem going on if your wife is hiding from you and not wanting to speak with you. When did this behavior start? You're sure you don't have any idea why she's acting this way? Sounds like you need couples  counseling to work on communicating better. Also she's telling you to spend time with her friends? That's odd.", "YTA.

And try to talk to her about getting a non lock knob?", "ESH\n\nIt\u2019s not about the door. \n\nThis is a failure to communicate. Why does she want to be locked away? There\u2019s a reason and that\u2019s what needs to be addressed. I despise people barging into my office when I\u2019m working. It\u2019s disruptive and disrespectful. If she\u2019s not answering, then let her be. If you\u2019re incompatible, then address that.", "YTA\n\nAs someone who needs privacy for work, is an avid reader and is not particularly sociable, it can be so exhausting to be involved with someone like you. It feels like we have to be ON all the time.\n\nMy SO and I love each other and can spend most of the day in the same house, doing whatever we need or want to do, and still only spend an hour or so with each other. And we're fine with this, because we are both, at heart, loners and pretty self-sufficient when it comes to keeping ourselves entertained. We don't consider it a rejection if the other is reading in another room, or playing a game, or just contemplating the universe. \n\nThe pandemic lockdowns were hell for those who always socialized. They were excruciating for the introverts who lived with extroverts. Imagine suddenly becoming the sole entertainment for someone who couldn't go to parties, join friends for dinner, travel.

Or did you pester her by constantly touching her or talking to her?\n\nKate can entertain herself. You? Maybe not so much. You're the social butterfly. She has a few select friends. You're friends with *everyone*, including all her friends and even her boss. You have invaded every corner of her existence and have now taken away her sanctuary. Give her back her damned lock.", "YTA. You clearly tried to force her to have your way. Maybe try talking with her WHY she need all of this time alone suddenly.", "YTA for changing her door knob. Read a few of your comments. Sounds like she works a lot since she\u2019s picking up the load for all her shitty coworkers and boss, that dump the work on her. Example, people decided to go to happy hour and your wife couldn\u2019t go since a lot of work got dumped on her. Or her boss would retire early if everyone was like your wife. Yet you\u2019re friends with all of them. I would lock my door too, since you\u2019re chummy with the enemy. I would feel like I have no allies, if all I do is work, take care of most bills, and my husband is just friends with all my coworkers, so that I\u2019m trapped at a terrible job.", "YTA. You're avoiding a conversation you need to have with her. Instead exerting control over her by taking the lock out of the door. It seems passive aggressive.", "YTA. The correct way to address this is to communicate openly with your wife about how her behavior makes you feel and try to figure out what's a better arrangement for you both. Your wife is clearly more comfortable in her own space without interacting with you. That's a serious problem. If there's an insurmountable breakdown in the relationship, it probably means it's time to initiate separation and divorce proceedings.\n\nThis move seems passive aggressive instead and I don't see how it addresses the core problem.\n\nOut of curiosity, how does a door \"wear out\"?", "It's definitely weird for your wife to lock herself away in the house! I really can't call you the AH since her distance seems odd as you described it.  I can only suggest since you're obviously unhappy with the situation (I would be too) that y'all try some counseling to figure out what you each want from this relationship, and where you all think boundaries of whatever sort should be.  NTA.", "Bro. Therapy. Communication. Don't just keep repeating the same excuses. You seem like you are being deliberately obtuse and won't accept any answer you don't like.", "I think the fact that your wife feels the need to isolate herself completely at every opportunity is worrying- is she depressed? I think you need to sit down with her and have an honest conversation- something's not right.", "YTA\n\nWriting on the wall being that your marriage is taking a detour for the worse, what are you planning to accomplish with this move? More than that, what did you even imagine would have happened? Your wife ignores you, but your reaction is akin to a child who repeatedly screams \u2018mom\u2019 louder each time. \n\nIf this is the way both of you resolve your issues, with your wife cutting herself off and you forcefully breaking yourself in; I would strongly suggest a marriage counselling or a divorce lawyer.\n\nEDIT/S: Grammar.", "Op it kind of sounds like you were suffocating her a little she may be feeling trapped and her way of dealing is being able to lock you out. Honestly you're TA for doing what you did. But also you're isolating her wether you realize it or not and yats toxic dude she doesn't have anyone you don't know that she can talk or vent to about y'alls marriage without maybe \"making you look bad\" and women are ingrained from day one to coddle dudes and their feelings so ergo she wouldn't feel like she could voice any I'll feelings with anyone....are you picking up what I'm putting down.\nAlso, I'm with everyone else on here, COMMUNICATE! And I mean more then just hey honey, I don't like that you lock your office door etc etc...more cuz saying vague things doesn't tell anyone anything you're an adult, use your words!", "ESH. You two need to sit down and talk this out. Get both of your feelings out into the open and work through them.", "Info: do you have friends of your own? I\u2019m not saying this to be rude but how often where you guys spending together before?", "If your wife is isoliting herself, forcing yourself on her is maybe not the best path to take. \n\nYou are not an AH, but a little clueless when it comes to problem solving. You need to have a serious discussion with your wife, with or w/o professional help.", "YTA. Your wife is intentionally trying to have privacy and you knowing took that away from her, as if it isn't a right she has. \n\nDon't be controlling. Even if you don't like what she's doing, that doesn't change her right to do it and doesn't give you the right to force her. If anything, you are making things worse.", "YTA for doing this instead of addressing the actual problem. Removing the door lock will just make her feel like you don\u2019t trust her or can\u2019t respect her need for space.\n\nI empathise. It sounds like something major is happening and you don\u2019t know what else to do. Is she open to counselling? Individual and couples? If this is a change in behaviour, you need to be more worried about your wife than about trying to force her to spend time with you.", "Going to go INFO here, as this feels like a symptom of a bigger problem. Why does she feel the need to spend large portions of her day avoiding you? Has she grown to dislike you, but not to the point of divorce, and you haven't noticed? Punishment for some perceived sleight? Scared of you for some reason? I don't really expect you to answer, as you wouldn't know the answers to these questions, or be trusted to be honest for the last one.\n\nSolely going on available information, E S H. Locking herself away without even a way for emergency contact should be either a last resort, or for specific situations. But taking away her ability to do so is too controlling in my opinion. Not making it my judgment as the reason could tilt the scales either way. Discuss it with her, and if that fails, seek professional help.", "yta. maybe she locks her self in cause that is the only way sue gets to be alone with out you barging in like the kool-aid man. you've already barged in her work life. like don't you have a job or friends or even hobbies that you can spend time doing instead of bugging your wife like a lost puppy. her work is her work stop meddling and pushing yourself into her work life. hanging out with her boss and coworkers without her is just weird. have you ever thought that all here happy hours the coworkers work getspushedonto your wife", "INFO: How long has this been going on? What happened around that time? How does a door get worn out? Before this, did you repeatedly interrupt her while she was busy?", "Your problems have nothing to do with a lock on the door - surely you can see that?", "Changing the door was a childish passive-aggressive move. So YTA for that. \n\nBut it clearly sounds like something much bigger is going on here. You need to have a real in-depth and honest conversation with your wife, tell her how you feel about she\u2019s avoiding you. Might be painful, but you need this talk instead of getting passive-aggressive about it. If you can\u2018t manage that in-depth talk yourself consider couples counseling.", "YTA.\n\n\"Kate\u2019s door is always locked when she\u2019s reading or working.

Come on, you knew she wasn't going to like that and you did it anyway.  Maybe instead of trying to prevent her from being able to escape you try to find out why she wants to escape you and if there's some way to fix that?", "NTA she can still use a door stopper and you have the right to disagree to her locking herself up all the time. Though, you need to act more mature here, sit down with her and have a talk to communicate to her how much of isolating each other is acceptable to you. Make sure you tell her what are your minimum levels of shared time and activities, make sure to propose ideas to her, invite her to things, ask her to spend time with you. If you will be actively asking and proposing and she will reject over a longer period of time, then you know you have a bigger relationship problem.", "This is tough, OP.\n\nI think you should replace with a door that does have a locking knob. Sometimes wives need that time alone to focus and be productive on their own. \n\nThat just might be her only place to really decompress and relax. Please don\u2019t take that from her because you may end up regretting it. I totally understand your perspective, but this situation isn\u2019t about you unfortunately. It\u2019s about respecting your wife\u2019s need for privacy and being able to be alone for a while.\n\nIf you finish doing something for her, just shoot her a message and let her know.

If it\u2019s true that you barely see your wife for an hour a day and every time you try to address it she dismissed your concerns and tells you to go hang with anyone else. That would be absolutely fine every now and then but if this is every single day outside of work as well then she is neglecting the marriage. She does not want to spend time with you. That is a fact right now. She doesn\u2019t want to spend any free time with you and she is supposed to be married to you. \n\nSwapping the door like that has put fuel on the fire, you deliberately went behind her back to get your own way.

SOMETHING HAPPENED. Whether she\u2019s lost love for you, cheated, hurt by something you did, depressed or whatever else, something has happened to change the relationship. Stop forcing yourself into her space, take her for couples therapy or your marriage is over. A lot of these comments aren\u2019t getting the fact that your wife is neglecting the marriage. You don\u2019t get married then lock yourself away from your partner and refuse to communicate why. I can\u2019t help but think if it was man who spent all of his time locked in his office, wouldn\u2019t respond to knocks and makes themselves completely unreachable for hours every single day and barely spends time with his wife, this comment section would be different.", "Counselling.\n\nOP needs therapy and marriage therapy.\n\nThis isn't about the door.", "YTA. Your wife probably only feels like a friendship broker for you. You are friends with HER boss, colleagues and friends. Do you know how weird that sounds?  You cook dinner for youe wife's colleagues, you talk to her boss about your wife (which her boss is not allowed to do), you go out drinking with your wife's colleagues, etc.", "YTA your marriage needs work, removing a lock won\u2019t fix your marriage. Go to counselling.", "YTA. From experience as someone that has been in your wife's position I can say:\n\n1. You need to back off. People need time and space to recharge, *even* from their spouses. Is she an introvert? Then that's doubly the case. Most people need alone time away from anyone. \n\n2. Please let your wife have her own friends and find some of your own disconnected from her life. It probably feels to her like *every* social interaction she has, has to include you, meaning she has no space to be a person away from you.\n\n3. Your wife will recover, but she needs time and if she knows what's good for her she'll never let it get this bad again, but you both *need* to figure out where the boundaries are and *keep to them*. Right now the only thing she needs is time **away**, but in the future propose relationship counselling to figure out what the right balance is for both of you.\n\n4. Accept that this may lead to divorce. People have different needs, and this situation may not be healthy for either of you. You should honestly both get therapy individually to figure that out.\n\nMy \"\"stalker\"\" (as I've taken to calling him after going NC) threatened to kill himself over me taking space away from him, and in the years since I've dealt with depression, anxiety and PTSD from that whole situation.

You discussed the replacement with her, and honestly it was a sensible decision for safety reasons. Relying on a door lock that might break down is unwise in the case of an emergency, so you chose a door with a non-locking knob. Your wife\u2019s annoyance in this case is understandable, but not wholly warranted.", "This might just be me, but I think it's pretty odd to lock a door just to work or read. I can just about understand it for a bathroom but even then when it's just a married couple together, it doesn't make much sense. \n\nWe don't lock any doors - if one of us wants some space, we'd just say so. \"Hey, I'm gonna read this book\" or \"I want to do some writing and need to focus\". \n\nWe use headphones in our office / behind the computers to be considerate to one another. Ditto when using a tablet or mobile phone. \n\nThe only situation where it generally even comes up is if one of us is watching TV. But even then there are solutions by just communicating your needs/want/feelings. \n\nIt feels like more is going on here. I don't know your wife at all, so I don't want to unfairly judge her. You also said she leaves her phone behind - so she creates a situation where she cannot be contacted at all. \n\nInstinctively, you'd first think she's doing something which she doesn't want you to know about - but this feels a little different. You need to talk to her and find out where this desire is coming from. It makes no sense for just reading a book. She's completely locking herself away both physically and mentally, with no way at all to contact her. That's not normal, regardless of where it takes place and that's even ignoring that it's disrespectful and concerning for loved ones.  It also doesn't help create a healthy relationship..\n\nThis is likely coming from somewhere else and she might genuinely need support and help to deal with it. \n\nOverall, NTA. People who have judged otherwise have misunderstood or failed to read what you wrote about the door - it wasn't replaced out spite or pettyness, but because it needed to be replaced. I'm assuming she wanted it replacing, but would have preferred another lock. \n\nThat room doesn't need a lock, it's not a bathroom and you're not keeping any state secrets there. Privacy is handled via respect and communication.", "NTA but it does t sound like a marriage it sounds like you are roommates. Was she always like this  or is it recent.

For example, do you pay the lion's share of the household bills?  That would explain why -she- hasn't filed for divorce yet.\n\nShe does not love you.  She can say anything she wants.  She has checked out of this marriage a long time ago.  \n\nYou need to grow a spine and get this person out of your life, immediately and permanently.", "The understanding is that she locks herself up at any hours, work or not. That is unreasonable.", "Is it wrong to want to see your wife? I think a spouse takes precedence over any job.", "Then be creative and slip a note under the door for her.\n\nI also encourage asking her more about this need she has to be behind a locked door with noise canceling headphones, to get a better understanding of why. And then respect her reason(s) for doing so, and don\u2019t cross that boundary.", "She says she has work and needs to read to keep her writing and reading skills sharp.

I am friends with her work friends and they work a lot less. For example, a couple fridays ago they had a happy hour (not planned by the company or anything) and they invited me. My wife suddenly had a bunch of work dumped on her she said and now she couldn\u2019t hang out with me.", "Her parents were cold and demanding to her but I wouldn\u2019t say abusive.

At least I know that I can reach her in an emergency instead of knocking on the door for 20 minutes.", "I don\u2019t know. I make friends easily. Her friends are my friends.

She actually helped me get my finances in order when we first started dating. \n\nWe\u2019re pretty even on the chores, too. I don\u2019t know what she would be using me for. \n\nI think I would know if she hated me.", "You have no basis on this hatred assumption. Some people isolate without realizing how much. It\u2019s possible she needs help", "whoa what alot of jumping to conclusions.", "Have you considered giving her space for a while? Let her have some time and space alone and circle back to it in a couple months. The more you beg, the more it will push her away.", "I WFH, my husband respects my workspace, you clearly do not - I\u2019m feeling smothered by just reading your comments, I don\u2019t know how your wife can stand it. You are encroaching on things you shouldn\u2019t be, like becoming besties with her boss, friends with her co-workers, this belief you must come before her job even though that job is what pays most of your bills.

Ask her what days and times are good for her to spend time with you. Try to separate out time for you to spend together and plan it ahead. If she can't or won't agree to spend sometime with you.

I still feel like a big factor of the situation is missing.", "Maybe she want's friends on her own that you do not take away from her?", "But that\u2019s just the work part.

The door is now changed, good. Now go and address the real problems you're having.", "It solves *your* issue, but creates new issues for her.

I\u2019d find it super weird if my wife was going out for drinks with my boss. Not saying that\u2019s the case for her but for me I\u2019d want more separation between my work and my private life.", "Yeah, I'm beginning to see where your wife is coming from.", ">I think I would know if she hated me.\n\nFair enough.  But what you two have is not a marriage.  Sadly, it's not even a halfway decent dating arrangement.  99.99% of guys would ghost their girlfriend permanently for such shenanigans.  So what does that say about a WIFE who acts like that?\n\nShe says she loves you.  Her actions are saying, \"You annoy the fuck out of me\".  And you say you think you would know if she hated you.  Without even a HINT of irony...\n\n(Calmly and very sincerely):\n\nYou deserve so much better, man", "I know sometimes people want to be alone sometimes.  But you need to take all this in context.   She locks the door, gets upset when she can't lock the door.  So who does she want to get away from?  Further, accuses hubby of invading her space.   Not because he's in her face, BUT BECAUSE SHE CAN'T LOCK THE DOOR TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM HER.  \n\nThat's the way you treat a poisonous snake.  Or a crocodile.  Or a gila monster.  If you view your hubby with such vile, why the fuck did you marry him?", "How do you interpret such obvious disdain for everybody else in the house, considering only one other person was mentioned?", "Counseling is definitely looking like the route to take here, because there\u2019s more than what\u2019s being said between you and her going on. \n\nReading from the other responses you\u2019ve made, she\u2019s checked out somewhere, and you need to have a conversation about that. I wouldn\u2019t exactly call you an AH, but the way you went about what you did was wrong. \n\nThat comment you made about her being your boss\u2019s favorite employee struck me as odd for some reason. But definitely set up couples counseling to find out what\u2019s creating the distance, address it, and make the necessary changes to bring back the closeness. All the best to you, OP", ">I became friends with her boss and he says that he would retire in 5 years if every employee was like my wife.\n\ndamn.   She has no sphere in life that you haven't invaded.", "I don\u2019t know. She just reads alone.", "She doesn\u2019t even have her phone or computer in the room with her. So unless she\u2019s got a burner, writing love letters or is having an affair with a book character, that doesn\u2019t really fit lol", "I doubt that. My wife is not that kind of person. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how she would. She works from home. She leaves her phone and computer out of the room when she\u2019s working or reading. She\u2019s given the passcodes to me for both long ago.\n\nI\u2019m friends with her boss and her coworkers. None of them know her that well but they all praise her for delivering top quality work. It\u2019s not hard when you\u2019re a workaholic like my wife.  \n\nI know she\u2019s actually reading the books she is. \n\nShe\u2019s just ignoring me in favor of doing work and reading her books.", "I wish I could upvote this a hundred times and simultaneously press OP\u2019s face into it until he gets it like when a dog shits in the house", "What\u2019s wrong with hanging out with a friend, even if they\u2019re your spouse\u2019s boss? Her boss has become nicer to the whole team after we started hanging out. It seems like he was a stressed out older guy with no friends.", "A wife means I\u2019ve made a commitment. She can\u2019t get rid of me like an old shirt.", "I don\u2019t know why she would check out from me. All she does is work and read and not be with me.", "I\u2019m a huge reader but if I\u2019m with someone I make sure to read next to them. Talk to her about it.

Even healthy couples go)", "In this context he is not your friend first, he is your wife\u2019s boss. That is an important distinction. I don\u2019t know man I\u2019m not your wife, I\u2019m just saying if it were me in her shoes I would not like it.", "Um. Do we really have to explain this to you?", "Do you think it might be worth learning to be more independent and finding your own hobbies and interests?\n\nIt sounds like you require your wife to be your emotional support person and in all honesty, I think you\u2019re draining your wife of all her emotional support. Your wife can\u2019t pour from an empty jug. You need to let your wife breath and you need to learn to be a complete person without your wife. The more you suffocate your wife emotionally, the more you will push her away. \n\nPlease go to therapy and speak about your emotional unwell being. If you genuinely love your wife and want her to love you back, go to therapy before you push your wife beyond the point of no return.", "Sorry but your commitment does not mean she cannot see it differently. That's just expecting people to be like yourself.", "Ummmmmm....\n\nIt reads like she already did though.", "Only she would know the real answer to that. Hence the suggestion for counseling, both individually and as a couple.", "Uh you said she pays most of the bills so of course she has to work??! Sounds like she's pretty much supporting the household... What do YOU do? \n\nMaybe if you contributed more, stopped invading every facet of her life and found your own friends she would have some breathing space...", "Some people need to concentrate. You disturb her. Back off, give her more space. Maybe, like a tortoise, she will slowly come out of her shell when you stop knocking on it", "She used to read on my lap :(", "If she doesn\u2019t want me to hang out with her boss she could just tell me that.", ">You need to let your wife breath and you need to learn to be a complete person without your wife. \n\n....that is especially important when the wife checks out of the marriage completely\n\n(honestly, what a redundant statement.  Wifey ghosts you, so you need to stop doing what she won't allow you to do...)", "I\u2019ve given her all the space I could give and she just takes more.", "\ud83e\udec2\ud83e\udec2\ud83e\udec2 I feel for you, brother. That\u2019s why I\u2019m suggesting this. There might be more to her isolation. Therapy can help her realize this and how it\u2019s affecting you", "Did you ask if she was okay with it? Or did you just assume she was okay because she didn\u2019t tell you not to? You\u2019re overstepping greatly and are unwilling to see it. You need couples counselling because boundaries need to be established and respected.", "She shouldn't have to!", "Just like how she can ask to be alone and you take away her door so you can barge in on her?\n\nYou obviously don't respect her boundaries, and I have a feeling she's asked and asked and you just ignore her.", "a) she shouldn't need to. It's common sense.\n\nb) feels like her literally blocking you out of her life is a pretty good indicator of where she stands."]}
