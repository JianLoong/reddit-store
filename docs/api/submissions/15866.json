We invited friends and family in the area, and generally had a blast, except for one thing. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s brother Fred was there with his seven year old daughter Sadie.

She also has a tendency to run off as soon as someone takes their eyes off of her. \n\nAbout a half hour after they arrived, Fred came up to me and asked if I could watch Sadie for a few minutes while he went to the bathroom. I agreed. Well, \u201ca few minutes\u201d turned into fifteen minutes, and I started to get worried (and a little bored), so I took Sadie and went looking for Fred. \n\nI found him chatting in a group of people. I acted relieved to have found him (not entirely untrue, I was glad he hadn\u2019t gotten lost), got Sadie to hold his hand, then made myself scarce. I ended up avoiding him for most of the rest of the party (mostly working the grill and hanging out with my sister), until Sadie had a huge meltdown (I think it was because Fred stopped paying attention to her for a few seconds, then tried to stop her in the middle of her running off) and they had to leave the party early. \n\nNow in the aftermath, my boyfriend\u2019s mom messaged me over Facebook and so told me that I should\u2019ve watched Sadie so that Fred could have a break for a few hours.

Society doesn't want to step up anymore. We're individualists now. We don't put others first or help. It's really about self interest. I get that it's not your job but everyone could of chipped in. That dad has to go back to that. He didn't get a moment to himself. It's not fair to put that on you. Others could of helped or distracted the kid for a while. Like a game of hot potato. But no one else seemed to have stepped up.  You're justified but what kind of society do you wanna live in?
