My fianc\u00e9 and I have been staying with my sister temporarily while our addition is being built. It's a fairly large addition so it's taking some time but shouldn't be any longer than a few more weeks. We have been crashing on my sister's large sectional in the living room. We pay for the food in the house (that's all my sister wanted from us). Hotels or Airbnb's aren't an option (due to the season- you're looking at $200+ a night). \n\nWell, we just found out 2 weeks ago that my wife is pregnant. She's 18 weeks (she had no symptoms and was still menstruating). It's a lot to process, considering we were told she couldn't have kids. My wife isn't taking it too well (fear mostly), especially because we are sleeping on the couch and there's zero privacy. I mean, these guys wake up at 6am and bring their dogs downstairs and they jump all over us and then we essentially get kicked out of the living room so my wife isn't sleeping very well, if at all. \n\nWell, yesterday my wife had an absolute meltdown because she is \"fucking tired\" of the dogs. All of them. One of the dogs even so much as goes near her and she is pissed because the dogs here have no boundaries and she's tired of being touched/followed. So I was like \"well why don't you take off for the day and go get a hotel for the night so you can sleep\". She does what I suggest. About an hour later I get a call from my sister saying \"I never fucking agreed to watch your dog so you need to come get her\". I guess I just assumed my wife would have taken the dog with her until I got out of work and then we would switch off or something and I would take the dog when I was out of work. So I call and say \"hey my sister wants you to go get the dog and I will just grab her after I'm out of work\". She immediately got pissed. \"So much for me getting a fucking break from the animals, huh? Pretty useless suggestion if you expected me to take your dog with me. I'm going to my mom's for the foreseeable future.\" She hangs up and won't answer my calls. AITA?\n\nETA: to clear up confusion, my sister has 3 dogs and then my wife and I have 1 dog.

This makes no sense. Are these dogs yours or your sisters? The second paragraph says they\u2019re your sisters dogs and they attack your wife.

If she wanted to have privacy and to not deal with your sister\u2019s animals she probably shouldn\u2019t have agreed to this arrangement. But, she is pregnant and pregnancy hormones suck. And your sister had a really strong reaction for it just being a few hrs and you\u2019d been living there all this time. I bet it\u2019s wearing on her too.\n\nAnd you need to step up. You should not have assumed. This dog is your responsibility too and it shouldn\u2019t be unlearning all of it\u2019s good habits. And you need to be a more gracious guest and husband. It was one day and you TOLD her she could get away.", "YTA. That you had to clear up that its your dog we are talking about really exemplifies that you are not taking enough ownership of this situation.\n\nYou are the primary nexus of all these actions. You have to take a more commanding role.", "YTA for creating this situation. Yes managing remodeling projects are hard. It's easy and normal to be stressed about that. You underwent this project without a plan for somewhere for you two adults and your dog to safely stay where all of your needs are met. And now you're seeing the cost of that decision. \n\nYou could take out all the details about pregnancy and dogs and you'd still be sleeping on the couch at another person's house - that gets old for everyone. The conflict would be the same. I'd show some understanding to your sister who opened her house. I'd give yourself some grace for being in a stressful situation. Show everyone and yourself some empathy for where they're coming from and work it out from there. If your sister does not want to watch your dog without you there, then listen to that. If you didn't discuss it before you agreed to stay there, consider the consequences of not communicating and figure it out now.\n\nI've had to leave my house unexpectedly when a company was doing some work at my house and didn't communicate how the work would impact our home life over a couple weeks.

So she rightly assumed that you would run it by your sister that the dog would be in the house alone, or make alternate arrangements. You offered her a break she desperately needed but didn\u2019t actually think through the logistics of making it happen.

I can see why she though it did since that was what she was complaining about so:\n\n1) You are an AH for thinking that when she said she was tired of the dogs there was an exception that was a dog.\n\n2) She is an AH because she should not be leaving the house without checking that leaving her dog there would be OK.\n\n3) Given that you are living at your sister's house for free, they can do what they want but I would get really tired of being woken up at 6AM by four dogs jumping around in the living room that I am trying to sleep in, especially since I just found out I was pregnant.  I can't go to AH here because of the arrangement but they are being thoughtless.", "YTA - the dogs - collectively - were the problem so why would you think that having taken you up on your suggestion to finally get away and get some rest she would take one of the precise problems with her. That\u2019s a half-arsed help and pretty useless. You were supposed to have solved this for her for a single day and instead by not thinking it through and clarifying with your sister you have actually made it worse.", "I mean esh.\n\nIf I were her I would also have assumed you meant you\u2019d handle the dog. The whole point was 0 dogs.\n\nYou both are the AH because you didn\u2019t make arrangements for your dog", "YTA because you are not being appropriate guests. You cannot demand these kinds of things when you are not even paying your way in someone else's home. You are not living in her home due to a crisis. You needed a place to stay for purely elective reasons. If you failed to include housing costs in the bid to build an addition, that stupidity is on you. So, too, are the consequences for that poor choice. If you chose to build an addition to your home but couldn't afford it, that merely makes you the asshole twice. Being a shitty guest, not budgeting appropriately AND expecting free kennel care from your uncompensated host makes you the asshole a third time. \n\nYou need to get your shit together, friend.", "YTA. I\u2019m not understanding why you thought your wife would take the dog if the whole point of going to the hotel was to get a break from the dogs and have some privacy from everyone.", "NTA it\u2019s her dog why would she assume that a 3rd party (your sister) would babysit HER dog without her asking?\n\nYoure at work. Why couldn\u2019t she simply ask sister if she could watch her dog? \n\nLike if this was children and she left her child for free babysitting at her in-laws place without saying anything\u2026like that would be an asshole move. Don\u2019t understand how she can leave something she is responsible for. Either take care of it or figure out dog sitting.", "YTA it\u2019s clear that you should have just taken the dog instead of calling your wife. \n\nBut, am I the only one who finds it strange that OPs sister wasn\u2019t cool with the dog being there without OP/wife? Like, presumably it\u2019s been there the entire time they have, and is going to be for a few more weeks right? Why can\u2019t the dog be with the other 3 dogs for a few hours one day? It\u2019s just strange, I guess she just didn\u2019t want an extra dog but idk I don\u2019t see what the few hours OP is at work make a difference over the weeks they\u2019re staying there.", "One dog is OPs. No where is it stated the dogs attacked. Jesus Mary and Joseph! One dog is theirs, so it's their responsibility", "Yes why couldn't OP tell his boss I'm bringing the dog to work! So simple", "My first too. The wife isn't capable of handling kids. This is an emergency situation. It might be soon enough to fix this. Either an abortion or a lot of therapy. But the wife is not currently safe or ready to have kids.", "This is an interesting question to consider. I have been pregnant 3x, I have ADHD, I have an autistic child. Neurodivergence is lifelong, which has given me time to work on having coping skills in place for my symptoms that would impact others. Pregnancy is temporary, disorienting, and the way your brain can shift into altered realities can be startling and fast, can change hourly, and importantly - you don\u2019t have a lifetime to learn to accommodate the ways it alters your perception and mental health. \n\nAlthough I would never use pregnancy as an excuse to be rude, I also won\u2019t lump it in the same category as neurodivergence, and I give pregnant people some extra grace in dealing with sudden massive emotional changes. For the same reason if it were possible to have \u201csudden onset ADHD\u201d I would give someone some berth to figure out how to deal with it, whereas I\u2019ve had time to work out accommodations and skills. \n\nPregnancy feels more akin to the way you might give someone some extra space when taking a new medication that alters their personality - not a reason to be a jerk, but getting irritable, forgetful, confused, or brain-foggy on some meds is also not entirely their fault. \n\nThe key line in this situation, to me, is OP\u2019s statement: \u201cwell why don't you take off for the day and go get a hotel for the night so you can sleep\". Even though yes, the wife could have double checked with both OP and the sister about what was happening with the dog - OP could also have recognized that he had a sleep-deprived touched out pregnant wife here, and he could have also simply said \u201cHey let me check in with my sister if you can leave our dog there and take off to a hotel - give me a minute to call her, okay?\u201d \n\nHe had the right instinct to give his wife a break, but passed on doing any leg work of figuring out the details of actually making the break happen. \n\nHe and his wife share responsibility for the dog, but having been in the shoes of having my body suddenly violently reject noise and sound in startling ways, compounded with sleep deprivation and brain fog - I am inclined to say he could have put in the call to his sister before making this suggestion. Pregnant wife doesn\u2019t get a pass for taking off, but OP had a simple option too, and isn\u2019t the one dealing with unexpected physical changes. \n\nLike I said, being pregnant isn\u2019t a reason to be rude, but it is often a solid reason for a non-pregnant spouse to do a smidge more leg work in support.", "Autism is also not an excuse to be an asshole either. I say this as a person diagnosed with autism.  The wife is not ready to be a mother. She just abandoned a creature without second thought", "Dont worry too much. Its seems he is the dog-wife troll.", "Well they are assuming op can take care of the dog from work", "Oh, no doubt about that. Pregnancy definitely warrants some extra respect and consideration. But a lot of the symptoms you spoke of also occur in someone with Bipolar Disorder. \n\nI guess my post was a roundabout way of saying that hormones are no excuse, just as we\u2019re taught neurodivergence is no excuse.\n\nI came from another thread where a person in OP\u2019s story was bipolar, and people were quick to judge him as a raging AH. And yet, coming here, many are saying that Pregnancy Hormones allow for more leeway when judging the wife.\n\nWe can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Beautifully put - the system shock of unexpected pregnancy (particularly when you believed  you can\u2019t have kids i should think) plus the continual fear that any bleeding -which she has been doing regularly - could be a miscarriage and lack of privacy and sleep - and potentially being jumped on by large/boisterous animals with no respect for your abdomen or its precious precarious cargo -  oh boy - it must be like total whiplash for the poor woman.", "No, it isn\u2019t. I was just pointing out the dichotomy of opinions on Reddit.", "Well OP was at work. You know the place that pays the bills. It's their dog their responsibility. Wait until the child gets on her last nerve. Home to mama? Some times you have to deal with your own pet", "It\u2019s not like they haven\u2019t been stepping out for work, groceries, etc unless the WHOLE time they\u2019ve been there one of them has been watching the dog the whole time. If I was staying with my family they would watch my dog no questions asked for errands, and I would do the same for theirs, and extra for babysitting of date nights or outings, to thank them for letting us stay. \n\nBut this family doesn\u2019t seem to be very good at communicating so.", "Look, if my wife was stressed and wanted to take a one-day break from childcare or whatever else, I as the husband would make the necessary arrangements to make sure she got the break. The way OP tells it, it just sounds like a half-assed effort to give her the needed break.", "If the wife is calling him saying \u201cYour dog\u201d then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a shared responsibility between them. It\u2019s his dog", "Of course it does, have you not read reddits responses", "My dog can absolutely last my entire work day, so assuming they last fed and walked them in the morning, when they get home from work would be acceptable.", "You live in lalaland", "ESH except your sister. You\u2019re staying with her for free and didn\u2019t make arrangements for your dog? Also I hate to tell you and your wife this, but pregnancy is a stone groove compared with having a newborn. Y\u2019all need better communications and coping skills before kiddo arrives.", "Yta. Are you dumb? She complained specifically about the dogs. Also just a heads up women with fertility issue often have problematic pregnancies/miscarriages.", "YTA or just really dumb", "ESH  \n\n\nOP, pregnancy is no joke, hormones makes you do crazy shit. So your wife acted poorly because of the situation but also because of her condition that she is trying to process cause she thought she couldn't have child !   \nNow about your sister, i'd say she didn't liked how your sister reacted, and is probably acting that roughly out of pettyness. Come on, she got 3 dogs already, having one more for the day is not more effort !   \nIf i were you, I'd try to figure out an other place to go, even for a week, with your wife (and dog). Maybe her mother would have you ? Try to find a solution to give to your wife that she can relax. And after this is cleared, have nice diner with your wife and sister to clear the air and everyone can brush it out.   \n\n\nGood luck to you, i hope the situation get better !", "YTA. If you have the money to build an addition, you should have budgeted for accommodations as to not burden anyone, because that is what two people and an extra dog crashing on the couch is - a burden.", "YTA. You and your wife are bums", "If your wife doesn't like being touched or followed, I have some BAD news about parenthood...", "Uhm probably because it\u2019s her dog and her responsibility. Why would she expect the sister to watch the dog?", "I highly, highly doubt that he even thought about where their dog was. Probably just assumed it was fine to leave at the house, if anything, and when he was called out by his sister he figured he could put the blame on the wife.", "Agreed that pregnancy does not make you incapable of being a decent human. I gotta note though, if my husband called me on the phone having an emotional \u201cmeltdown,\u201d to the point where I felt moving to a hotel was the best path for him, I would also take the step of having a conversation with my sibling and asking them for the favor of watching our dog until I could get home. If sibling said no, I would go home or ask my husband if he could hang in there for a few more hours. \n\nA part of my marriage I am grateful for is when one of us is in a hard place, the other person gives them a break, and that includes doing a little leg work to ensure that it\u2019s actually a break. It makes life so much easier to have a partner who sees the whole picture of what is needed. \n\nSo yes, a pregnant woman with a history of infertility, recent bleeding, and staying in a home with jumpy large animals and inadequate sleep can definitely still function, and I agree the right thing to do would have been to communicate. Not here to argue at all. I just think OP could have taken on that role, too. Sometimes needing a break also means needing a break from logistics, so I hope OP takes that onboard. When baby arrives, that situation is going to arise over and over in different forms.", "She probably made the more logical assumption that OP had already spoken to his sister about it.\n\nShe also refers to it as \u201cyour dog\u201d it\u2019s not her dog. It\u2019s his dog that he cares for", "I think that\u2019s too strong of a take, personally, based on available info. Leaving a dog in the house where it\u2019s living, when another adult is around, isn\u2019t comparable to abandonment. It\u2019s a lack of courtesy to the other adult, yes, but we also didn\u2019t hear the conversation - she could have assumed OP would handle talking to his sister when he offered her a break, just as OP assumed she would handle it. There aren\u2019t nearly enough details to judge her fitness as a mother. \n\nI think we can be a lot more understanding of people, even when we think they could have changed how they acted. Infertility,  recent bleeding during pregnancy, and large jumpy animals not respecting physical space, is a lot to take in at best and a mess of trauma triggers at worst. (I genuinely didn\u2019t understand how scary that swirl of things could be until I was in it.) We weren\u2019t there. \n\nI\u2019d encourage us all to not jump to extremes in condemnation here, especially just from a few paragraphs.", "Thanks for articulating your empathy for her so well. You touched on a really important piece here too. \n\nI have some trauma around the topic of bleeding during pregnancy, so I currently have to limit how much I engage with that topic, but I fully agree that having large animals invading your space when you have a recent history of bleeding, especially with a history of infertility, could be extremely distressing. On a deep deep level that may be extremely hard to explain to anyone who hadn\u2019t gone through it.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to project my own experience where we don\u2019t have details, though. I just could easily see myself making a hasty exit too, and needing grace for mistakes around it. That\u2019s all I am trying to say.", "Thanks for your thoughts. I think I hear what you\u2019re saying; I would say that the existence of varying, non-equivalent medical situations means we don\u2019t need to draw a single line, like \u201cany deviation from the \u2018norm\u2019 is/is not an excuse.\u201d This forum exists at least partly because so much depends on individual situations, yeah? Is that what I\u2019m hearing you say - like \u201clet\u2019s not make any blanket statements such as \u2018neurodivergence is no excuse\u2019\u201d? Or do you think we do need those categories?\n\nI didn\u2019t read every comment above, the ones I saw that mentioned hormones were pointing out that OP could have shouldered more since he wasn\u2019t dealing with the physical burden of pregnancy. (Maybe someone was giving a blanket pass, and that\u2019s what you were noting - not sure.)\n\nI didn\u2019t see the thread with the individual with bipolar disorder, so I can\u2019t speak to specifics. In a broad sense, people with mental health issues deserve compassion. They also sometimes have options for treatment, therapy, and engaging coping skills.  If someone repeatedly refused treatment and didn\u2019t avail themselves of options they had, they might bear different responsibility for their actions, even those they couldn\u2019t control in the moment. Someone experiencing their first manic episode though, it\u2019s a bit different. They haven\u2019t had the same chance to adjust or access resources. \n\nIf we need to make a moral comparison, I would say pregnancy is less like global conditions like bipolar disorder / neurodivergence, and a bit more like someone who just started taking a medication with strong and unpredictable side effects. You still have moral responsibilities. You also have, by comparison, very little time to exercise your agency to whatever degree you can to accommodate that altered physical and mental experience. I think time frame of having chances to exercise whatever control you have is relevant to responsibility. \n\nI don\u2019t give anyone a blanket pass and you\u2019re right to note that blanket rules don\u2019t work. In this case, I don\u2019t think her actions were equivalent to OP\u2019s and I\u2019m comfortable weighing pregnancy as one factor here when considering who should have stepped up about a dog. Two people can be wrong, but not in the same way. \n\nIn fairness, someone supporting a pregnant spouse might need time to fully take on their new role too. If OP had been used to his wife doing certain kinds of logistical and emotional labor while he was at work, it can take some time for him to realize what that work even was and, now that it\u2019s gone, what he needs to do. Everyone deserves some understanding, even when we believe they could change. \u270c\ufe0f", "I probably would have assumed if my husband told me to go to a hotel to relax that he\u2019d already asked his sister to dog sit and she had agreed \n\nPersonally I\u2019d check first", "I agree with much of what you say. My statement was more to the effect of \u2018what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander\u2019, and making a larger observation about people\u2019s attitudes overall.\n\nYou are correct in saying that people with mental illness have access to treatment and therapy, and that IF it\u2019s available in their area, and IF they can afford it and access it, it can be treated in the chronic sense.\n\nI would also point out that l, in this day and age, pregnancy is usually VOLUNTARY, and is accompanied by an much more extensive body of research and empirical medical science, with the added benefit of the collected wisdom of every mother on Earth to give perspective.", "You ever notice how people use money they might receive to buy goods like food?", "\u201cThese guys wake up at 6am and bring their dogs downstairs\u201d\nClearly OP\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t live alone, so I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re working out \u201cmore than half the people eating the food\u201d."]}
