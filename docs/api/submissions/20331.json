We pay for the food in the house (that's all my sister wanted from us). Hotels or Airbnb's aren't an option (due to the season- you're looking at $200+ a night). \n\nWell, we just found out 2 weeks ago that my wife is pregnant. She's 18 weeks (she had no symptoms and was still menstruating). It's a lot to process, considering we were told she couldn't have kids. My wife isn't taking it too well (fear mostly), especially because we are sleeping on the couch and there's zero privacy. I mean, these guys wake up at 6am and bring their dogs downstairs and they jump all over us and then we essentially get kicked out of the living room so my wife isn't sleeping very well, if at all. \n\nWell, yesterday my wife had an absolute meltdown because she is \"fucking tired\" of the dogs. All of them. One of the dogs even so much as goes near her and she is pissed because the dogs here have no boundaries and she's tired of being touched/followed. So I was like \"well why don't you take off for the day and go get a hotel for the night so you can sleep\". She does what I suggest. About an hour later I get a call from my sister saying \"I never fucking agreed to watch your dog so you need to come get her\". I guess I just assumed my wife would have taken the dog with her until I got out of work and then we would switch off or something and I would take the dog when I was out of work. So I call and say \"hey my sister wants you to go get the dog and I will just grab her after I'm out of work\". She immediately got pissed. \"So much for me getting a fucking break from the animals, huh? Pretty useless suggestion if you expected me to take your dog with me. I'm going to my mom's for the foreseeable future.\" She hangs up and won't answer my calls. AITA?\n\nETA: to clear up confusion, my sister has 3 dogs and then my wife and I have 1 dog.

This makes no sense. Are these dogs yours or your sisters? The second paragraph says they\u2019re your sisters dogs and they attack your wife. But then your sister wouldn\u2019t be calling you to say take care of your dogs.", "ESH. You and your wife are staying somewhere totally for free. If she wanted to have privacy and to not deal with your sister\u2019s animals she probably shouldn\u2019t have agreed to this arrangement. But, she is pregnant and pregnancy hormones suck. And your sister had a really strong reaction for it just being a few hrs and you\u2019d been living there all this time. I bet it\u2019s wearing on her too.\n\nAnd you need to step up. You should not have assumed. This dog is your responsibility too and it shouldn\u2019t be unlearning all of it\u2019s good habits. And you need to be a more gracious guest and husband. It was one day and you TOLD her she could get away.", "YTA. That you had to clear up that its your dog we are talking about really exemplifies that you are not taking enough ownership of this situation.\n\nYou are the primary nexus of all these actions. You have to take a more commanding role.", "YTA for creating this situation. Yes managing remodeling projects are hard. It's easy and normal to be stressed about that. You underwent this project without a plan for somewhere for you two adults and your dog to safely stay where all of your needs are met. And now you're seeing the cost of that decision. \n\nYou could take out all the details about pregnancy and dogs and you'd still be sleeping on the couch at another person's house - that gets old for everyone. The conflict would be the same. I'd show some understanding to your sister who opened her house. I'd give yourself some grace for being in a stressful situation. Show everyone and yourself some empathy for where they're coming from and work it out from there. If your sister does not want to watch your dog without you there, then listen to that. If you didn't discuss it before you agreed to stay there, consider the consequences of not communicating and figure it out now.\n\nI've had to leave my house unexpectedly when a company was doing some work at my house and didn't communicate how the work would impact our home life over a couple weeks. Packing my family and dogs and finding places in short notice was not fun but we are adults who live with the impacts of our decisions and figure it out.

Why would she take the very thing that is stopping her from getting rest with her? You dropped the ball on this one. You should\u2019ve planned to keep the dog with you so she can have the moment for herself.

That statement, to me, means \u2018let me take care of things so you can get a break from the dogs\u2019. So she rightly assumed that you would run it by your sister that the dog would be in the house alone, or make alternate arrangements. You offered her a break she desperately needed but didn\u2019t actually think through the logistics of making it happen. Like, how would \u2018taking off for the day\u2019 help a damn thing if she had to take the dog with her?\n\nGoing to her Mom\u2019s for the foreseeable future seems like a good solution.

Your wife\u2019s quote in your post clearly states it\u2019s your dog and not your wife\u2019s dog. You should have taken your dog to work or kenneled it if you truly wanted your wife to rest.

Once the other dogs, the couch, the sleep became an issue then you guys have overstayed your welcome.\n2. You are staying in someone elses house, THEIR RULES.  You have been there before I am sure so you know how her dogs act.  Knowing this you decided to stay here anyway, I read the financial hardships of staying elsewhere.\n3.

Especially if you brought a really annoying dog with you and your wife took off for the day and dumped the really annoying dog on her (and I say this as someone with super needy rescue pets, lol.) \n\nSo your wife is with her mom. Can she stay there for a few days and catch up on sleep? Can you stay with your sister? Can you do doggie daycare with the dog for a few weeks while you are working and the remodel is being finished and crate the dog at night so it doesn't jump on you? Why are your sister's three dogs jumping on you all night? Can they not be crated? This just sounds like dog chaos...", "ESH:  You shouldn't have assumed but what I think a lot of people are missing is that the op wife or fianc\u00e9e whatever she is shouldn't have assumed either.  She should have asked your sister to watch yall dog. Not just leave and say nothing to her.", "YTA - You dog needs peace and rest.", "ESH you and your wife. You sister is doing you both a huge favor letting you stay on her couch for free. Your wife isn\u2019t the asshole for needing a break, but she is one for abandoning your dog with your sister without talking to her.
