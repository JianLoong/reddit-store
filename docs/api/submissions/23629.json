I have one older sister, Lyric, who's 20. My dad is still single but my mom married Tom when I was 5. Tom has a daughter Lucy and she's 16. Lucy and I never got along when we were younger and that did not change as we grew older either. I didn't start out disliking her that much but over time I grew to almost hate her. Not quite. But I would never choose to be around her either and I do not like having her in my life, nor would I help her out \"as family\". Lyric was fine with Lucy at first but over time she grew tired of Lucy and they were no longer okay. Lucy ended up spending more time with her mom when she was 12 because she didn't like that her dad married my mom or that I was there. I always spent equal amounts of time with my mom and my dad, but for the last two years it has been my decisions per the courts.\n\nLucy's mom died a couple of months ago and Tom stayed in his ex's house with her for a few days while the funeral was being arranged and stuff. Lucy didn't want to leave. Mom told me that Lucy would of course be living with them full time now. She wanted me and my sister to be there for Lucy. But things never changed between Lucy and me and when Tom was still at his ex's house, I went for my dad's custody time and I chose to stay. I have visited my mom outside the house but I told her Lucy and I would not do well living together and that I didn't want to be there. \n\nMom thought I was being dramatic but when a month passed and I didn't go, she asked to speak to me. So she came to dad's house and said she wanted to know when I was coming home. I told her I'd visit sometimes. But I was going to take up the right to decide where I stay and stay with dad. She asked me why and I told her I did not want to live with Lucy. She told me Lucy needed her family. I told my mom that her and Tom were there and so were my younger half siblings. But I am not Lucy's family and I would not be there for her.\n\nAnother month has passed and now my mom and Tom are pissed at me. They are also pissed that Lyric has never reached out to be there for Lucy either but she's an adult so they take that frustration out on me. Mom said she raised me to be a better man and brother to my sister. I told him the only sister I have is Lyric, that I also have three younger brothers. But that's about it. Mom said I should spend overnights there and be with my family and when I said no, she told me I was behaving like an ass.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690890446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fa8kt/aita_for_staying_with_my_dad_after_my_stepsister/", "score": 95, "replies": ["NTA\n\nYou have tried to have a relationship with Lucy since you were 5.  If the two of you haven\u2019t formed a friendship in the last 11 years, I\u2019m not sure why your mum & Tom think that this will happen now.  Some people just don\u2019t get along.

Your examples of how Lucy would snoop, spread rumors, and telling you and your sis that your grandma died is not acceptable. You\u2019re smart to stay away. \n\nI\u2019m assuming your mom knows what Lucy has done? The sad matter is past behavior is indicative of future behavior, and you\u2019re protecting yourself. Tell your mom:\n\n\u201cLook, I get that you want me at your house. But you need to understand that being around Lucy is not healthy for me. You know how she snoops and then tells *my* private business to others. How is that okay in your eyes? You know she told me and Lyric that grandma died and she did not do so kindly. Again - how is that okay in your eyes? I am not willing to live with someone who does these things. I will visit, and you and I can meet for dinner outside of the house, but I will not live under the same roof with Lucy.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m also guessing that with your living with your dad that child support has now flipped - she pays him.", "NTA, your life your choice.

If you ask her if she preferred you stay with your dad, I don\u2019t think she will say, \u201cno, I want you here with me\u201d. You\u2019ve done what you needed to do, in an adult way.

Lucy isn't ready to move out of her mother's house. Forcing her to move to a house where she's surrounded by people who don't care about her mother is a special punishment on its own, let alone a house where an overly helpy busybody stepmother is trying to force two extra people she actively doesn't get along with to live with her so she can play happy supportive families.\n\nShe's 16. She's not an infant. Most countries in the world would grant her her own legal standing with enough paperwork. Neither of you wants any part of this ridiculousness and good on you for sticking to your guns. NTA.", "NTA if you and Lucy don\u2019t get along then it\u2019s best for you to be with your dad.

That has to be very difficult and unfortunately when people grieve they try and take it out on others. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re protecting yourself because I could foresee you being her punching bag. \n\nYour mom needs to understand that you being at the house could possibly make it worse for Lucy and that you feel uncomfortable being around her. Tell your mom you love her and Tom and your half siblings and you would love to see her more outside of the house but that it is in the best interest for you mentally and emotionally not to be put in that situation and I bet Lucy would feel the same way. \n\nSometimes people do not get along and that is normal but with blended families, sometimes you can pretend to play perfect family no matter how much your mom and Tom beg you to. Good luck, OP.", "My parents don't have the best relationship so even though my dad would advocate for me, it would only make things worse, not better. My mom would not like hearing it. She's already pissed he's not making me spend every other week with her.", "NTA, don't budge from this. Let your Mom be there for Lucy if it's so important to her.", "Yes, mom and Tom know how she is. Tom would discipline her for the stuff she did and then we'd be pushed back together again. Mom would tell me that blending families is a learning curve and love and patience is needed. But I never loved Lucy so that was never something for me to practice with her.\n\nNo child support was ever paid since my parents always had us equally and I'm not sure things have changed.", "I have not spoken to her since her mom died so I have not been a jerk to her. I'm doing my best to stay away.", "She thinks she's entitled to know everything. Even stuff that is nothing to do with her. She'll snoop to find it out. Then she doesn't mind telling other people about it. I had some really shitty experiences with her with that. There's also the fact she thinks she can control others to get what she wants. My mom and Tom used to force us to play together so we were forced together a lot. It made those behaviors even worse. As we got older she knew it bothered me so she'd poke at that stuff. The big thing was when my grandma was sick. She listened in to my mom and Tom talk about grandma being sick. Lyric and I didn't know and so Lucy decided to tell us that our grandma had died and she'd been sick and didn't want us to know. Grandma was not actually dead.\n\nI think a lot of stuff she did was to try and break her dad up from my mom. But it often dragged us into stuff too. It led to so much fighting between us.\n\nShe's also someone who thinks she can say what other people do.", "No, I have not spoken to her since her mom died.", "Ah gotcha.  So arrange to meet your mum (and only your mum) at a neutral location like a coffee shop.\n\nTell her how you feel. That you\u2019ve tried for 11 years, but these are the reasons why you don\u2019t get along with Lucy.  (Don\u2019t say attacking statements against Lucy, which could lead to your mum being defensive.  No one can dispute how you say you\u2019re feeling, so it\u2019s a less confrontational route.  It could be things that you have no common interests, you have differences of opinion etc.  write a list down to help you during the discussion.\n\nAcknowledge Lucy\u2019s loss and what your mum said about Lucy needing her family around her.  And reiterate that she has her, Tom and the 1/2 siblings.  Reiterate that as you and Lucy have never been close, you don\u2019t think that having you there will make any difference. Also, whilst you can empathise with Lucy\u2019s loss, you feel that it\u2019s not appropriate that you are expected to play happy family due to the circumstances.  Ask your mum to respect your choice and leave it there.\n\nHang in there OP.", ">Mom would tell me that blending families is a learning curve and love and patience is needed.\n\nI'm sorry but what? She and your dad divorced - that isn't your fault so why is she forcing you to get along with everyone? But that logic, couldn't she used her 'love and patience' to stay with your dad instead of divorcing? \n\nYou're NTA, Lucy's BS is for herself, your mom and Lucy's dad to deal with, even dealing with Lucy's mom's death. As long as you're not actively malicious and just be neutrally indifferent, there's nothing they can do. You don't owe anyone a relationship, especially not a step sibling. I would suggest trying to find ways to become independent asap so you're not depending on parents that expect some sort of emotional payment for being their son.", "Blending families is a learning curve, sure I can get on board with that analogy. But it\u2019s ultimately the parents responsibility to help everyone get around the corner.\n\nSounds like your mom tried nothing and is all out of ideas.", "Right, I really meant \u201cjust don\u2019t be a jerk\u201d which it sounds like you\u2019re managing pretty successfully. Crap situation for all of you though.", "Well...maybe work as a team.", "OP can also say it might make things worse for Lucy. She has to settle into a new house and living with a stepmother while mourning her mother. Interacting every day with someone she does not get along with - why is irrelevant - is not a good thing for her at this time. I mean does Lucy really want stepsiblings she doesn't get along with to be there for her? I doubt it. It is not lying or spin to say that it is better for Lucy if OP stays with his Dad.", "Have you read OP's comments?\n\nShe lied to OP and told him that his Gran was dead when she wasn't.\n\nOP's mum has clearly tried to force a relationship between them, but only estranged them further.\n\nStep sis has made it clear she likes making OP unhappy. Just because she's lost her mum that doesn't mean OP has to let her treat him badly.", "No, I'm not doing extra research.\n\nThe team work was Lucy (that might not have been the name) telling the parents she doesn't want him around either and maybe they'll chill out.\n\nMaybe not I don't know these people for real. Just an idea, there's no bad ideas in brain storming."]}
