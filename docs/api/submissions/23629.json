I have one older sister, Lyric, who's 20. My dad is still single but my mom married Tom when I was 5. Tom has a daughter Lucy and she's 16. Lucy and I never got along when we were younger and that did not change as we grew older either. I didn't start out disliking her that much but over time I grew to almost hate her. Not quite. But I would never choose to be around her either and I do not like having her in my life, nor would I help her out \"as family\". Lyric was fine with Lucy at first but over time she grew tired of Lucy and they were no longer okay. Lucy ended up spending more time with her mom when she was 12 because she didn't like that her dad married my mom or that I was there. I always spent equal amounts of time with my mom and my dad, but for the last two years it has been my decisions per the courts.\n\nLucy's mom died a couple of months ago and Tom stayed in his ex's house with her for a few days while the funeral was being arranged and stuff. Lucy didn't want to leave. Mom told me that Lucy would of course be living with them full time now. She wanted me and my sister to be there for Lucy. But things never changed between Lucy and me and when Tom was still at his ex's house, I went for my dad's custody time and I chose to stay. I have visited my mom outside the house but I told her Lucy and I would not do well living together and that I didn't want to be there. \n\nMom thought I was being dramatic but when a month passed and I didn't go, she asked to speak to me. So she came to dad's house and said she wanted to know when I was coming home. I told her I'd visit sometimes. But I was going to take up the right to decide where I stay and stay with dad. She asked me why and I told her I did not want to live with Lucy. She told me Lucy needed her family. I told my mom that her and Tom were there and so were my younger half siblings. But I am not Lucy's family and I would not be there for her.\n\nAnother month has passed and now my mom and Tom are pissed at me. They are also pissed that Lyric has never reached out to be there for Lucy either but she's an adult so they take that frustration out on me. Mom said she raised me to be a better man and brother to my sister. I told him the only sister I have is Lyric, that I also have three younger brothers. But that's about it. Mom said I should spend overnights there and be with my family and when I said no, she told me I was behaving like an ass.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690890446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fa8kt/aita_for_staying_with_my_dad_after_my_stepsister/", "score": 1875, "replies": ["NTA\n\nYou have tried to have a relationship with Lucy since you were 5.

My mom and Tom used to force us to play together so we were forced together a lot. It made those behaviors even worse. As we got older she knew it bothered me so she'd poke at that stuff. The big thing was when my grandma was sick. She listened in to my mom and Tom talk about grandma being sick.

As long as you're not actively malicious and just be neutrally indifferent, there's nothing they can do. You don't owe anyone a relationship, especially not a step sibling.

She wanted her dad to stay with her in her mom's house ffs.

What is their problem???", "Out of curiosity do you even think Lucy wants you to \u201creach out\u201d? From the way you describe it, it sounds like she never wanted a relationship with you either. \n\nIf your mom keeps harassing you about this, maybe try reframing the situation through this lens. Start by saying you feel bad for Lucy and understand how tragic this is for her. Then ask your mom to stop assuming what Lucy wants. You can walk your mom through Lucy\u2019s toxic behavior and explain that if Lucy truly valued a relationship with you she would\u2019ve corrected her behavior a long time ago. \n\nRemind your mom that this is a volatile time for Lucy and she just lost a huge part of her security and support system. Be sure to emphasize that Lucy does not see you as a part of that support system. In fact, Lucy uses you act out. \n\nThe truth is that another forced attempt at step-sibling bonding is the last thing Lucy (and you) need right now. It will end the same way as before, but the damage will be worse this time. \n\nRemind that you not being in the same house of Lucy, it\u2019s probably creating a more peaceful environment for her to process her grief. \n\nLast resort- try a guilt trip and remind mom that she\u2019s your mom too: Just as Lucy needs to be supported, you need to be protected from Lucy. Remind your mom that she\u2019s your mom too. Your mom is asking you to go into a living situation with someone doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries. The only thing that has changed is that this person is going through a rough time and doesn\u2019t have the capacity for empathy (probably never had it to be honest). You are trying to protect yourself by avoiding someone who doesn\u2019t show you respect. Your mom has not addressed that issue. She keeps ignoring Lucy\u2019s pattern of behavior and is not making it clear how she will help you protect your boundaries when Lucy wants to act out.\n\nYou could say \u201c mom if I have a roommate in college who treated me the way, Lucy treated me you would tell me to move because you love me\u201d. \n\n\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAt the end of the day, there a lot of ways you can play this, but I do think your mom might receive your argument better if you reframed it as a benefit. Her big counter argument is that you were cold in Calais to Lucy, losing her mother. Reframing your position that staying away from Lucy (and your mom\u2019s house) is an act of kindness challenges, her core argument. This reframing shows empathy consideration to Lucy, as well as the family that lives at your mom\u2019s house.\n\nLastly, I just want to say this, I really don\u2019t think Lucy wants you there and I do think that should be addressed by someone."]}
