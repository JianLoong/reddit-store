I have one older sister, Lyric, who's 20. My dad is still single but my mom married Tom when I was 5. Tom has a daughter Lucy and she's 16. Lucy and I never got along when we were younger and that did not change as we grew older either. I didn't start out disliking her that much but over time I grew to almost hate her. Not quite. But I would never choose to be around her either and I do not like having her in my life, nor would I help her out \"as family\". Lyric was fine with Lucy at first but over time she grew tired of Lucy and they were no longer okay. Lucy ended up spending more time with her mom when she was 12 because she didn't like that her dad married my mom or that I was there. I always spent equal amounts of time with my mom and my dad, but for the last two years it has been my decisions per the courts.\n\nLucy's mom died a couple of months ago and Tom stayed in his ex's house with her for a few days while the funeral was being arranged and stuff. Lucy didn't want to leave. Mom told me that Lucy would of course be living with them full time now. She wanted me and my sister to be there for Lucy. But things never changed between Lucy and me and when Tom was still at his ex's house, I went for my dad's custody time and I chose to stay. I have visited my mom outside the house but I told her Lucy and I would not do well living together and that I didn't want to be there. \n\nMom thought I was being dramatic but when a month passed and I didn't go, she asked to speak to me. So she came to dad's house and said she wanted to know when I was coming home. I told her I'd visit sometimes. But I was going to take up the right to decide where I stay and stay with dad. She asked me why and I told her I did not want to live with Lucy. She told me Lucy needed her family. I told my mom that her and Tom were there and so were my younger half siblings. But I am not Lucy's family and I would not be there for her.\n\nAnother month has passed and now my mom and Tom are pissed at me. They are also pissed that Lyric has never reached out to be there for Lucy either but she's an adult so they take that frustration out on me. Mom said she raised me to be a better man and brother to my sister. I told him the only sister I have is Lyric, that I also have three younger brothers. But that's about it. Mom said I should spend overnights there and be with my family and when I said no, she told me I was behaving like an ass.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690890446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fa8kt/aita_for_staying_with_my_dad_after_my_stepsister/", "score": 345, "replies": ["NTA\n\nYou have tried to have a relationship with Lucy since you were 5.

My mom and Tom used to force us to play together so we were forced together a lot. It made those behaviors even worse. As we got older she knew it bothered me so she'd poke at that stuff. The big thing was when my grandma was sick. She listened in to my mom and Tom talk about grandma being sick.
