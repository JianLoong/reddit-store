She knew that I'm sure but still decided to not do her own makeup (we bonded over makeup on the daily and she was talented) with the expectation I'd still do it for her. I apologized profusely but I told her if she wants to still have day light and guests in attendance, we've gotta just do something quick and get a move on. I even offered to do her makeup as we planned after she gets back from her honeymoon and I'll pay a photographer to do bridal portraits to makeup for it.
