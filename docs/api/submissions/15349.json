NTA\n\nYou didn't get a chance to get the dress altered as time went on as she kept it at her house. \n\n\nHow big were you before vs the wedding?\n\nQuite a lot of Brides diet to lose weight for their wedding (photos especially).\n\nWas she struggling to lose weight herself? Maybe she felt upstaged as you are slim now and she was okay with you being a bridesmaid / MOH next to her when you were on the larger side...\n\nKinda like when crazy brides won't pick a good friend, who just happens to be stunning, to be their bridesmaid even though they are the obvious choice. The type who enfore no / minimal makeup on their bridesmaids, or give them frumpy unnatractive dresses to keep the spotlight on them on the 'big day'.", "NTA and tell her to back off! We don\u2019t police peoples bodies!", "NTA if you're paying for the adjustments to your dress I don't get what the big deal is. \n\nDressmakers must be used to people losing weight for a wedding and so be able to accommodate your healthy switch with timed adjustments.", "10 Bridesmaids? OMG!  I thought it was \u201cSeven Bridesmaids for Seven Brothers\u201d? The wedding party seems excessive and the bride seems like a bit$h.", "NTA but how is this person still your friend?", "Your health is more important than ANY wedding. That friendship is over. Move on. Get better friends. A wedding day doesn't give brides the 'ok' to be a jerk to everyone around them. Get rid of her.", "NTA.  \n\nWere you bigger than the bride before you lost weight?   I wonder if she was jealous.", "Nta", "NTA what? She'd rather you have a heart attack or stroke as you walk down the aisle? That would really take attention from her", "NTA. What a petty B. You put your health first and she\u2019s mad. The entitlement of brides makes me wonder if narcissism is rising more in this country. I think individualism is making people lose their minds, be selfish and petty to the extreme these days. 10 bridesmaids? Was it family or just extra? For me it\u2019s rare to have such a large party nowadays. \n\nMy mom had that many bridesmaids because she has 6 younger sisters. My cousins and I have some trauma (I mean some awful stuff) but none of them would tell any of us to sacrifice our health. That\u2019s a line in my family you do not cross.", "Info: Did you not have possession of your dress? You didn\u2019t try it on 2 weeks/a month before and got it tweaked then?\n\nYou\u2019re not the AH for looking after your health and Amy sucks for admonishing you for taking steps to do so, but the day of the wedding was really not the time to find out the dress wouldn\u2019t fit again. \n\nI don\u2019t think Amy is upset about your weight loss. I think she\u2019s upset you didn\u2019t take steps to proactively deal with the consequence of that (dress not fitting) yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not about the dress. It\u2019s that you were seen as a rival due to your weight loss.", "INFO: does the bride weigh noticeably more than you?", "Amy is a brat! I hate how ppl will spend tens/hundreds of thousands to have a nice wedding but zoom in on a relatively unimportant part of the DAY THEY ARE MARRYING SOMEONE. Sorry for the caps but i need people to get the picture of why all of these stories are ridiculous. Not you OP I feel terrible you were treated so poorly by a close friend.", "I think you need to also lose the exact weight of bridezilla. Congrats on your lifestyle changes and the healthy changes", "NTA. A friend would care more about you being healthy than a fucking dress. She doesn't sound like someone I'd want in my life, frankly.", "NTA.  Feel sorry for the poor bastard that married your friend tho.  Bridezilla behavior is a major red flag in my book.", "In what world does a friend get mad at you for becoming a healthier version of yourself and looking better? This does not sound like a true friend to me at sounds like someone who is jealous, because there was no inconvenience, caused by the dress alteration to her when you paid for it out of pocket, and the second alteration was easily fixed without any added stress to her either. So it honestly sounds like maybe looked better than her in her wedding dress? Lol. I would get better friends who actually care about you and want only the best for you because this baby girl is not it.", "You had me at \u201c10 bridesmaids\u201d. NTA. You got stomped by a bridezilla.", "NTA\n\nHow the fuck would you be an AH? She has no say over your body. Congrats on the weight loss and better health though!!!!!", "NTA but this was probably not about the dress. Sounds like the bride probably had either gained a few pounds or was subconscious about her weight and did not want to stand next to a very skinny MOH and look even bigger.", "NTA did you look better than is the question?", "\u201cAll 10 bridesmaids\u201d tells me all I want to know about this situation. NTA.", "OP commented that the bride insisted on keeping the dresses with her where she lives in Illinois. OP lives in Florida so had no way of being able to try it on closer to the date.", "Yeah, the \"she was stressed\" shit doesn't cut it.\n\nEveryone would be like \"he's controlling, why are you friends?\" if this was a dude, which I hate to say because it's a cliche.", "Yessss that bugs me even more than there/their/ they're and to/too", "So complicated because when you loose weight your dress becomes lose.", "My advise it too not loose you're mind over small misteaks.", "Yeah, with most styles of dress, having it a little loose isn't going to look bad in pictures (and can be fixed with pins as they did). I have a hard time believing that the bride was worried about OP looking *bad* because she lost weight.", "My first thought as well. She doesn't sound like a good friend having superficial priorities such as this. People forget that a wedding is one day, and treating people terribly throughout the planning effects those relationships long term.", "My thought exactly", "Very true! This was many years ago, but I remember when my dad was ordered by his doctor to make some lifestyle changes for his health. He ignored most of it, but eased up on the snacks, did some light exercise, minor stuff. None of us noticed a difference in his appearance. We all found out he had lost weight because he put on a suit he hadn't worn in months and his pants nearly fell off. His response was \"goddammit, the dry cleaners gave me the wrong suit!\" Mom managed to do some emergency alterations, so the day was saved, and we all had a good laugh.", "sounds like bridezilla is a lousy friend", "It\u2019s so common that I\u2019ve become a bit desensitized to it lol right now I cannot believe how no one on Reddit apparently knows how to spell \u201cpaid\u201d!", "She wanted OP to bare with her.", "Ugh yessssss. Or fianc\u00e9/fianc\u00e9e.\n\nPsychologist seem to be really hard for a lot of people too.\n\nBooks are your friends people! Pick one up from time to time!"]}
