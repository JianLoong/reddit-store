He gets gifts from \"santa\" at his grandparents but we don't put any under our tree, we don't put out milk and cookies (we have 4 cats), and we don't go ring sleigh bells on the roof, like my parents did.\n\n\nSo today, my mom asked me again if we were going to do Santa this year, which we're not. Now Christmas is her favorite holiday and Santa is a huge part of that, so when I told her we weren't she said we're robbing his childhood of magic.\n\n\nI was HEARTBROKEN, as a kid, to learn that Santa isn't real. I don't want to set my son up for that kind of disappointment. We also don't live in the greatest area and I don't want him to be even a LITTLE bit okay with home invasion.\n\nAita?

But, if you are genuinely just trying to avoid the heartache, you can have Santa and just be less good at hiding the secret. \n\nAlso, make sure he knows that he is NOT to tell other kids, or your kid is gonna get ostracized because other parents are going to be pissed if he says anything.", "NAH only because you get to choose how you raise your kids.\n\nMy family grew up fairly low income. I won't say poverty, because we survived. My parents saved all year to give us kids that magical experience, to the point I believed in Santa until I was 12 because logically, it made no sense my parents could be Santa financially. When I realised Santa was my parents, I was so grateful. They sacrificed a lot to give me and my siblings some magic.\n\nMy favourite part of the year is keeping that magic belief alive. My oldest found out last year it was me, and he was nothing short of grateful. He was so excited to be in on the 'secret' and to keep it going for his little brother. I have worked hard to be able to give my children the magical Santa experience that I had growing up. It took a lot of sacrifices.\n\nIt sucks you saw it as betrayal, but those are your feelings and you are entitled to them. I wish it had gone differently for you.\n\nBut please, pleeeeeaase don't be one of those parents who allows their kids to ruin it for other children their age.\n\nDo Christmas as you see fit! Of course! It's your right, and if you don't want Santa, then don't do it. \n\nBut I do have to ask again, please teach your little one the myth and why we keep it a secret. Because some parents do want the magic, and it's really hard to keep it alive these days.", "NTA but also I loved Santa as a kid, absolutely love Christmas and I literally have no memory of finding out Santa doesn't exist,  I think you'd be surprised how well kids can take things if they're taught how to control and understand their emotions and the things around them. I definitely can understand your mom's pov", "NAH- for me personally, having \u201cSanta\u201d is what made Christmas my favorite. Not so much the presents but the magic and the flying reindeer and the idea that there was this far away place up north full of magic and fun and toys. I can definitely see how your mom would be worried that Christmas can\u2019t be the same for a child without it. And I don\u2019t think she was trying to be mean about it, just telling you what she felt. \n\nStill you are allowed to parent however you want. And if you decide no Santa, that\u2019s 100% your prerogative.", "NTA, just tell him to not ruin it for other kids. It's not a great way for other kids to find out", "NAH but there are plenty of ways to do the Santa reveal that don't make your kids think you lied to them. It's just there are too many lazy parents who don't put much thought into their actions.", "NTA\n\nI get it that you were heartbroken as a kid, but you can't deny that you didn't have a lot of enjoyment around that concept. You also have to remember that your child is not you. It is very possible that they will have no issue with the transition from fantasy to truth as they get older. 3 is also a tough age because if your child is in school/daycare, there will be a lot of other kids talking about Santa or even the possibility visits or pictures with Santa set up, and it's hard for that age to truly understand the idea of \"not real\" or \"this is a secret you can't tell other kids\". Regardless, You are the parent and you know your child the best. \n\nMy wife and I decided to do Santa with our now 3yo, but we also make it clear that Santa only brings smaller gifts, so for one she recognizes that her parents provide the good stuff, and two so that when she is in school there aren't other less fortunate kids upset that they were good and Santa didn't bring them as much or anything.", "NAH as long as your mother keeps it at that one comment she made and respects your and your partner's decision. She's allowed to be disappointed and disagree with your choice, but she is required to respect it. \n\nYou are of course allowed to raise your child how you see fit (within reason, of course), and personally I see nothing wrong with not doing Santa.", "NTA. Santa isn't for everyone and you choose how to raise your child. As long as you and your wife are on the same page that's the main thing. \n\nYour point about home invasion is a good one. Not to mention trying to explain to a kid why there's a cute song always played on the radio about good old home invading Santa kissing Mother while he's there. \n\nSanta memories that have stayed with me are not good ones.\n\nTrust issues since I insisted (strongly) year on year that Santa's handwriting looked just like Mum's, to be told it was nothing like it when I just knew.\n\nAlso what you get from 'Santa' is just a contest some kids keep winning.\n\nNot to mention the pressure from older siblings to lie and say you still believe in Santa when you don't, cause 'if you believe we still get presents'.", "NTA. The holidays can still be a fun, magical time without the inclusion of a fantasy character. There are so many ways to find delight in the season, so maybe you should talk to your mom about making a new tradition that will make the holidays special for her, you, and your son. \n\nI\u2019ll add too that I think doing Santa can potentially include some heartbreak for parents too. My boyfriend is currently agonizing over when we should tell his 7-year old that Santa isn\u2019t real, if his belief continues on after this year. He still believes and will likely be devastated when he finds out- and frankly, my boyfriend doesn\u2019t want to be the person to break his heart.", "NTA. Tell him the story of Santa Clause though. Let him be inspired to be generous to others and make their lives better. You don\u2019t have to do the whole magic man who flies around the world to still pass on the idea of his story.", "NTA\nHow is lying better than not?", "NTA I did the same thing for the same reasons.", "Im just here to say the title had me thinking this was going to be a completely different issue. NAH", "NTA\n\nThere is plenty of magic and wonder in this world without needing to lie.\n\nAnyone saying \"you are denying your son a magical childhood\" just depresses me that all the wonder in their life is fake.\n\nTheres no need for fairies when butterflies exist ya know?", "NTA. We don't do Santa in the traditional way. \n\nIt's always been a part of Christmas but we've always been honest that it's just pretend and it's a fun thing people do. \n\nThe magic isn't lost. Our boys still love to participate even though they know it isn't real.", ">We also don't live in the greatest area and I don't want him to be even a LITTLE bit okay with home invasion.\n\nI laughed so hard that I nearly woke my kid. This is such a dumb reason.", "NAH. However, I do think it\u2019s sad you won\u2019t let your son have that magic while he\u2019s young enough to. We live in such an ugly and brutal world and that\u2019s one of the purest joys a kid gets during their childhood and has a very limited window. My best friend growing up always knew Santa wasn\u2019t real, I know they all plan to raise their kids with Santa as a result.", "NTA. My oldest never believed in Santa and it did him no harm at all. It's clearly very special to your mum but I think you've created a nice space where it can be a game they play or a story they tell each other.", "My kids are Jewish. (I am the only member of my nuclear family who is not.) My husband likes the idea of Santa because he feels its fun for children. But, he'd agree with anyone who just didn't want to deal with the constructs of \"Christmas.\" People should do what they want, after all. Its their family. I used to work with a lady whose single parent mom told her, \"I'm Santa Claus. I work hard so you can have the things you like. Not Santa and definitely not Dad.\"\n\nAt any rate, I think when we introduce our kids to our ideology - that's fine. Its not anyone else's business to meddle in. Its not their family, after all.  Its not like my Jewish offspring go to temple and show their friends what Santa brought them. Their belief systems did not change to include St. Nicholas. They know to not intrude on other people's traditions and ideologies because kids are smart - not st\\*pid.  Your kid will not lose anything based on you not blowing up Christmas to be a big deal.\n\nNTA. Not a big deal. Its yours to decide.", "Nta. \n\nYour kid, your rules. I have a few friends that grew in a santa-less home and they're fine. No disappointment or stolen childhood.", "NTA. Your house, your traditions. It might be better for him in the long run but you'll probly want to have a plan for when he starts school with kids that*do* believe in Santa.", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to different celebrations and traditions. Your mom is likely remembering their own fun creating magic for you without taking into account how that impacted you emotionally. If it was a formative enough disappointment to cause you to not want to participate with your own child, that\u2019s perfectly okay. Many cultures don\u2019t participate in Santa and still have equally magical Christmastimes.", "NAH. I grew up being taught that Santa wasn't real, and it never ruined things for me. It put more of an emphasis on family. I will! However make a major suggestion if you are going to go down this road. The only issue I experienced was  my parents didn't make it clear to me not to tell other children - so me being the 'helpful' child I was. Triex my best to help my friends who were being lied to! This did lead to some teasing, losing some friends, and a lot of arguments at Christmas time with my friends. Because I was trying to keep them from looking stupid, and didn't understand I was ruining the magic for them. I do think your child will be fine not believing in Santa - but make sure! That they know not to ruin it for others.", "NTA I didn't want my son to be disappointed when he found out Santa isn't real. Instead I told him that Santa can be anyone. Santa is the spirit of Christmas and we can each have that spirit in us. That's why we see different Santas at different places. He can be Santa. I can be Santa. It's fun without lying or disappointing my son.", "It's funny because the memories that stick out the most to me about Santa as a kid were also not great, like you, but like the opposite reason. I was so relieved when I found out Santa wasnt real when I was a kid! I had like anxiety all night Christmas Eve that someone was coming into our house and during the holidays was anxious that Santa saw everything I was doing...I was so happy I could let go of all that stress lol", "NTA  I never believed Santa was real as a child and we have never told my daughter he is real. When she was younger she liked to pretend and we all enjoyed the game, but she always knew where her presents came from really. \n\nI have never liked the idea of lying to my child or creating the impression that getting a lesser present than a friend does is a judgement on her behaviour or worth rather than simple difference in income. \n\nYou will need to have the conversation about other people believing and that they need to respect that, but you are not ruining your kids childhood in any way.", "NAH. My sister didn't do santa with my niece, she is fine. She still enjoys the holidays. Made things a bit more complicated for big family gathering because my 2 other nieces do believe in santa, but my sister just made sure my niece knew not to tell other kids santa wasn't real. My sister spent time talking about how some families believe in santa. \n\nMy sister still read books about santa or Christmas in general and my niece still enjoyed those things. I think my sister also explored what other cultures do around Christmas and santa with my niece.", "NTA. my son is six and we have never done santa. we don\u2019t really do christmas (we do yule) but my whole fam does xmas so it sort of all bleeds together. my kid is aware other kids believe and not to ruin it for them. i think he got sort of bummed as he got older that santa wasn\u2019t real so we said if he wants to pretend santa is real that\u2019s totally fine. my kid still loves the holiday despite not having the whole santa complex lol.", "NTA. We did it like you are doing and it didn\u2019t ruin Christmas magic at all. One year our kid asked us to play pretend the whole month of December so we did. We got super into Santa and read stories from around the world. We made a BIG game of pretend and he LOVED IT. I also hated it when I was lied to as a kid. I knew right away my parents were full of shit because Santa isn\u2019t logical. But they keep insisting their lies were the truth. It really messed me up. I begged for honesty. I was five. Kids aren\u2019t dumb. Well, most are not. \nWe still play pretend and have a blast. My oldest confirms he is happy we didn\u2019t lie to him. He HATES surprises to boot, so for years he had to know what the presents were. That\u2019s better now. Lol\nKids love playing with their parents. If you really get into pretending about Christmas you will have a genuine, wholesome, family activity for weeks. I have no regrets. Their father has no regrets and he originally was afraid we were going to rob them of joy. Lol Our boys have no regrets. Playing the game was better than thinking a stranger visited their house. It gave them MORE joy because it was an intentional, loving, family game of pretend. I\u2019m tearing up thinking about the memories. They are older now. Time flies. So make your memories. Play pretend. It was a great choice for our family. It created deeper, honest connections with each other. Shit. Fucking onions.", "NTA.", "NTA but please teach your child not to ruin it for other kids", "NTA. I let my kid pick and choose. Easter bunny and Santa? Hell no! That was home invasion. Tooth fairy for some reason? That was okay. He only got a quarter. 50 cents if it was a tough tooth to lose. But over all, he had plenty of magic as a child. Broad imagination, lots of pretend play. He didn\u2019t need the once a year stuff and never seemed to be bothered by it one way or the other. He\u2019s a teenager now and doesn\u2019t feel like he missed out.", "Can I just offer one piece of advice? It's something my dad told me after my oldest kid was born and it really struck a chord.\n\nYou have, at best, 10 years of your kid's life where you are the very centre of their world, where magic and fantasy and fairies are real, where Santa and Rudolph are real. You have 10 years where your kid is *a kid* and then after that they are gone. You will never get those precious moments back with them, because those after those 10 years, your kid is on a journey away from you and into their own life. You will never have the kind of closeness, the kind of implicit trust, the kind of silly, spontaneous joy that a kid brings after those years have passed. Cherish them because they'll be gone so much faster than you can imagine.", "NAH. My parents did do Santa, but I was a very science minded child and kind of assumed he wasn\u2019t actually real from as far back as I remember. \nI think your idea of framing it as a game of pretend is great, but I\u2019d say maybe go for the fun parts of Santa without trying to convince him that a real old man is gonna come in the house. Kids do get the difference between fiction and reality, but are usually down to play the game anyway. The fun part for me was seeing what my parents set up for me every year, the bites out of the cookies or the snow (flour) boot prints on the floor, etc.", "NTA\n\nI hate the whole santa thing and lying to kids. I just really don't think adults should be lying to kids about this.\n\nIt's grand if you have decent parents who have the funds to support Santa.\nBut it must be terrible for abused kids who are tortured with being 'bad kids' because santa never comes or families who can't afford the next big or 'in'", "NTA. I\u2019ve decided not to do Santa for my son. He\u2019s autistic and I\u2019ve heard of so many autistic kids being devastated when finding out Santa is not real. I\u2019d rather be honest with my son. In all things. There is lots of magic at Christmas without Santa.", "NAH. There's different ways of doing things. Could you maybe modify [this](https://www.upworthy.com/theres-a-brilliant-heartfelt-way-to-tell-your-kids-the-truth-about-santa-take-notes-rp) concept and have your kids participate in *being* a Santa, rather than lying to them about the existence of a jolly old elf? Then they can have some of that magic through sneaking and being kind to others.", "Nta. You get to raise your kid as you think best. Participation in Santa is not mandatory", "NTA, everyone celebrates Christmas differently", "NTA, our kid after all but be careful, My friend grew up in a fam that did as you are doing and he hated his parents for it, never forgave them, went low contact after high school and now that he has his own family, he excludes his parents from all Christmas activities and doesnt even let them visit from just after thanksgiving through new years.", "NTA. \n\nWe didn\u2019t do any of those things with our kids either. \n\nIf you want people to trust you don\u2019t lie to them for *years*. \n\n[Moses v Santa rap battle](https://youtu.be/0kRAKXFrYQ4)", "NTA I was raised that Santa was fake and it was our responsibility not to tell our friends we knew the truth. The way my parents did it made it so fun for me. I knew something none of my friends knew, and played along with them until they all found out. \nI was so grateful that my parents trusted me enough to let me in on the adult secret, and respect them way more for telling the truth.", "NTA. Christmas \u201cmagic\u201d is still possible without Santa. I ruined Santa for myself as a small kid cause I eavesdropped on my mom telling my older brother (what can I say, I was nosy) and it never really disappointed me cause I still knew the gifts would be coming. It did help that Santa never brought the big presents - those came from family and we were open about knowing that. \u201cSanta\u201d only did stockings, and that tradition continued after we learned the truth.", "NAH\nThere's no argument here.\n\nYour mom can like the tradition of Santa. She can feel that forgoing it will be a regret for your child.\n\nYou as a parent can choose not to partake in the tradition.\n\nPlease though, talk to your son about how different families celebrate differently and that it isn't ok to tell others their beliefs aren't real.  Remember how you felt when you learned?  Don't let some other kid go through that early because your kid tells everyone at preschool, daycare, etc. The \"TRUTH\"", "NAH it\u2019s your choice as a parent and I understand your reasoning however its slightly sheltering. I mean as a child will you never let him believe in anything that isn\u2019t real? And while it was heartbreaking finding out Santa wasn\u2019t real I have WAY more happy memories as a child of when to me he was. Those are the ones I think about when I think of my childhood Christmas: enjoying making the milk and cookies, writing out my list, my dad would even leave fake Santa boot imprints I\u2019m our living room. Holding onto the fact that you found out Santa wasn\u2019t real seems like one of those things you really need to let go tbh.", "NTA.\n\nSanta can be fun and magical. But Santa is not necessary to have a fun and magical childhood.\n\nA loved one gave me a talking to over the phone about how I was denying my children magic in their lives by not believing in Santa. I spent the rant watching my child tell a ray of light they thought was Tinkerbell secrets to bring back to Peter Pan.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother's favorite holiday should have no bearing on how you raise your child. You may want to be VERY CLEAR to her on this. \n\nAs an example, what would her reaction be if you insisted she decorate for September 19th, including costume and the accent. What? She doesn't know its **Talk like a Pirate day**? How can she be so disrespectful to your **Pastafarian** beliefs? Does this mean she won't wear her best colander when you bless your sauce? B-)\n\nWhat is important to her is just that, important to HER. She does not get to dictate either how you raise your child nor what must happen in your home.", "NTA - people try to say oh it makes Christmas more magical. Like have you people met a kid or remember being one? Kids don't need help in making their world magical haha. It's keeping it magical after they get older is what's hard. To me, people don't want to admit it, but they use Santa as a discipline device because they don't want to use other methods to discipline their kid. And I mean like actually talking and explaining to them why they can't do certain things. And the whole lying to a kid then breaking their hearts doesn't sit right with me either and contradicts the whole Santa makes things magical. If anything teach the kid about the actual St Nick, which I think is a better lesson learned anyway.", "NAH. I'm totally with you on this. I felt completely betrayed by my parents when I learned about Santa, and never fully trusted anything they ever said again. I mean, it's so many lies you have to tell your kids. How is that magical? I think it's reasonable to want to raise your kids in the real world with completely honesty and trust. To me, being able to fully trust what your parents say is magical all on its own. \n\nI don't super blame your mom for being upset because it's always hard to hear that your kids didn't like the way they were raised and you're changing the tradition, but she needs to respect your parenting decisions.", "I think I always knew Santa was my parents. Why do we perpetrate these lies to children? Easter Bunny, Santa, the Tooth Fairy and various deities just teaches kids that the adults they trust will lie to them.", "NTA.  I still get irritated when I think back to my family lying to me.  My daughter, now 15, had no Santa, and there were no ill effects.", "NTA \nMy siblings and I never believed in Santa. The magic was never stolen. We enjoyed movies and everything.  You are not ruining anything.", "NTA.\n\nPersonally, don't like lying to kids either.", "NTA. That's your choice as his parents. Full stop. \n\nIt's understandable that your parents are disappointed, but you still get to make the call.", "NTA we did the same thing with the understanding that our kiddos didn't tell other kids that Santa wasn't real...we explained that was the parents job.", "NTA. but I can see you've told him not to tell other children that Santa isn't real. I think you need to be prepared for that to not hold up, and for other parents to be very angry with you when your kid is a normal kid and lets the cat out of the bag.\n\nThis happened to me and my parents. I told my kindergarten class Santa wasn't real. Myself and my parents were ostracized and disliked for years because of this (K-5 parents sure do find the stupidest reasons to hate each other).", "Nta my parents never did Santa. Much less that creepy ass Elf on a Shelf nonsense.   You know what I, as a kid,  liked about Christmas?  The presents!", "Soft YTA - It's not about lying to your child.  When my son asked if Santa was real I said \"Well let's look it up.\" We did \"research\" and looked it up on the computer. Santa's character was very much inspired by real people from around the world, so yes, he's \"real\" in the sense that he has brought joy to kids around the world and brought them gifts.  I let my son come to his own conclusion.  He was very receptive to the explanation and I explained to him that it's important to keep the magic of Christmas for others.\n\nMy husband very much preaches that Santa comes to our house. We still celebrate the magic, and my son is 15 and still gets his stocking stuffed. He has little sisters and is looking forward to keeping the magic of Christmas alive for them. It's not about whether or not Santa exists. It's more than that. I certainly don't give Santa credit for big gifts. The family usually gets family activities, such as board games to play together.\n\nDon't punish your parents or your son by being a Grinch.\n\nIf you want to let them do Santa gifts, keep it simple.  Try something he wants, something he needs, something warm and something to read.", "NTA. Same. I still like to have presents magically appear on Christmas Day, but everyone knows they're from me. I had a...difficult time when I found out Santa wasn't real. I think being honest from the jump is more beneficial than having it all come crashing down in the future.", "NTA", "NTA \n\n\u201cAs I got older I realized that the \u2018Christmas magic\u2019 I experienced as a kid really came from the love of my parents!\u201d", "NTA\u2026you do you.

Perhaps you are projecting your issues and could benefit from pausing just a little to reflect on the situation.\nSanta never brings the most expensive or largest. It\u2019s a smaller gift and the kids know he comes as long as you believe. This is weaves into our family traditions intended to draw our family closer. Personally we encourage all of the \u201cmagical\u201d visits from tooth fairy to Easter bunny. Childhood is short and the world can be harsh.  A bit of magic can certainly extend childhood just a bit.\n\nSo you do you, build your own traditions.", "NTA. It\u2019s your decision only. We never did Santa with our kids. We did tell them that if their friends believed in Santa it was not their place to tell them otherwise. I believed in Santa very briefly as a child because an older sibling told me. Christmas was not spoiled for me. Some of my best memories are still coming downstairs on Christmas morning and seeing the tree lit up with presents underneath. Nothing was spoiled. To me, it seems a little strange the lengths some parents go to to continue the charade so that 6th graders still believe. Your kid will love Christmas with or without Santa.", "Nta. I will never tell her that he's real. My parents didn't even celebrate Xmas with us but they did allow our grandparents to. Let them lie to your kid. But I would see the looks on my classmates faces when one kid is bragging that Santa bought them an Xbox and the other kid is bummed because Santa only got them socks. It's brutal. It also perpetuates the idea that people who receive more deserve it because they're inherently better people and *gestures vaguely at the public dumpster fire that is American politics*\n\nDon't lie. Tell them that you work hard for their gifts and every gift is a representation of how loved they are.", "ESH.  You can do what you want.  You are projecting your reaction on your child and that\u2019s how you teach them bad things.  Most kids don\u2019t care if Santa exists and do it in fun.  Same with the home invasion.  Projecting again.  Stop it.  This is how kids get fearful of things that are completely unrelated.  Santa cannot invade your home because he doesn\u2019t exist.

He still loves the magic of Christmas and is really glad that we made Christmas such an enjoyable experience, with all the rituals like going to panto and putting out the milk and cookies and the carrot for the reindeer.

He gets gifts from \"santa\" at his grandparents but we don't put any under our tree, we don't put out milk and cookies (we have 4 cats), and we don't go ring sleigh bells on the roof, like my parents did.\n\n\nSo today, my mom asked me again if we were going to do Santa this year, which we're not. Now Christmas is her favorite holiday and Santa is a huge part of that, so when I told her we weren't she said we're robbing his childhood of magic.\n\n\nI was HEARTBROKEN, as a kid, to learn that Santa isn't real. I don't want to set my son up for that kind of disappointment. We also don't live in the greatest area and I don't want him to be even a LITTLE bit okay with home invasion.\n\nAita? Are we robbing our kid of Christmas magic? Or are we giving him the option while making sure he knows the truth.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All kids are different of course, and the way you find out probably makes a difference too.  I didn't have one life-shattering realization, it was just something that made sense with time as I got older.  And then my mom would ask me and my older siblings to help set stuff up for our younger sibling and it was so much fun being part of the magic!

The kids still get one gift on Christmas Eve (pjs and a book) that mysteriously appears under the tree while they go to church.

He keeps a list of who is naughty and nice, giving presents accordingly. Meaning rich kids with happy families are apparently more good than poor kids who's parents can't afford expensive gifts from Santa, and neglected/abused kids think they must have been bad that year.", "Not everything is good about Santa. If I have kids I wouldn't be doing it. It's not bringing magic to Christmas to intentionally do things a child will be confused over. \n\nHonestly Christmas got so much better as a kid when we were done with the pretending.

Until you're a grown up lol.", "I love that", "I think it could be a cool way to let your mom do the santa stuff with him. Even if he knows it's make believe he can still enjoy it, most kids enjoy make believe and intentionally play make believe games. There are also other things you can do to make Christmas magical, I don't think magic has to mean make believe. In our family it's about other dun traditions we all do together.

It was just a story that turned out was not real. As a kid you believe a lot of stories and later find out they are made up and that's not a big deal. (and who knows, Santa might be out there after all and maybe he just retired a long time ago and the parents took over his job. That's what I came up with because I still liked the idea of Santa.)\n\nMy friend on the other hand had a real meltdown when she found out.

I totally get not wanting him to feel betrayed I was devasted when I found out the truth, but it was more upset it wasn't real than betrayed, because the whole world was in on it.

I don't know if it was true, but the kid was brought out for a treat and told \"the truth\" about Santa.  Everyone \"big\" was Santa, they had to pick someone and do a kindness, get a small gift but keep it a secret to keep the magic alive.  \n\nWhatever you pick, your kid will be fine, I would maybe be prepared for when he's older if they ask why Santa goes to grannys not here?  \n\nGood Luck :)", "My parents never really did Santa.

Empathize, say **\"that must have been pretty surprising to hear that the presents don't come from a big guy in a a red suit.\"** But now that they're a big kid they are old enough to become Santa.\n\nGet your kid involved in giving to others, they can pick out stuff for toy drives, pick out gifts for family members, etc. If they're quiet and trustworthy enough, you could wake them up after their younger sibling goes to bed and have them help put a few presents under the tree and then enjoy one of the cookies left out for Santa.", "NTA. In a very similar situation. My son\u2019s father is from a country that doesn\u2019t do Santa so I had to explain that some people believe and some don\u2019t.

I loved doing Santa with my son when he was little but I don't think it would have been horrible to not do it either. There is still the joy of the season. I DO want to say here that you need to explain to him that he does not get to argue with other kids about whether Santa is real though.

I vividly remember running around our home, peering through all the windows trying to find out where they were coming from. Who were they?

My parents did Santa for me and my brother.  We did Santa for our kids.  I honestly can\u2019t remember when I found out Santa wasn\u2019t real\u2026I think I always just kind of knew.  Probably because my Mom didn\u2019t really make a big issue of his \u201creality,\u201d it was almost just a thing we all played along with for as long as I can remember.  I remember being very young when I would sneak into my parent\u2019s closet to look for the hidden gifts.  I don\u2019t remember my kids being devastated either because we never really made it a secret that Santa was really just us.  Our version of Santa made little Christmas Hunts for the kids, which gave them clues in each gift.  One year it was a \u201cFear Factor\u201d styled hunt where they had to do crazy things (jump in the pool) to get their next clue.  Fun times!\n\nI guess my point is that you can have Santa without making it some quasi-religious figure that they believe in.  I\u2019ve always thought that Santa actually is \u201creal,\u201d as in, it\u2019s more of a spirit of love, magic and holiday fun.  That\u2019s kind of what we have told our kids and what my parents told me.  I have such wonderful memories of my Christmases as a kid and I know my kids do too. \n\nNot to say that a Santa-less Christmas can\u2019t also be just as loving, fun and magical.  It\u2019s just not something I can relate to.", "NTA.  Jews, Hindus, Muslims, etc all dont have \"christmas magic\" and all those kids grow up fine.", "NTA, we never lied to our child.

As you are the parent. However, if you wanted to have Santa in some form, I suggest do what my parents did.\n\nThey told me that Santa is multiple people. My parents were Santa for myself and my brother. With the other kids telling me that Santa wasn't real, they just didn't become Santa. *I* became Santa for several years for my brother. I am Santa for all the people who still believe Santa is one person. \n\nIf you find out Santa isn't real and you don't *want* to become Santa that's quite alright. \n\nYour son is three though.

It didn't make Christmas any less fun.", "Santa Claus might not be a person, but there\u2019s something important to the human spirit about believing in things that might not be true. TBH, I came in thinking that there was nothing wrong with it, it was probably about religion or something, but the more I think about the more I find it sad that a little kid got robbed of that chance to believe in something that\u2019s more about the spirit than the person. Your child will not be permanently harmed in any measurable way, but things that are not measurable can still be meaningful. Even if it is just a little bit less faith in the abundant mysteries life has to offer us, it is a failure to foster the attitudes that help us find fulfillment in an otherwise cold and meaningless world. \n\nYou mention one of your own greatest childhood heartbreaks being the realization that Santa Clays is not real. The only things that can cut to our hearts that badly are things that bring us great value. The worst irony here being that finding out Santa Claus isn\u2019t real shouldn\u2019t be a traumatic moment, it should be a time where we are able to acknowledge that things that aren\u2019t real can still bring us joy and there is no harm in believing in joyful things. It\u2019s one of the realizations that I really think is a great teaching moment if handled well. As a parent, do you really want to deny your son the same joy that Santa Claus gave you for the sake of protecting him the heartbreak? Or do you want to give him an opportunity to learn about how to handle the courage and disappointments that come with real faith? We will all handle many disappointments in life and if the first one is that Santa Claus isn\u2019t real, your son is very lucky and you are very lucky that this is the one that left a mark on you. So many others have it so much worse, and have to learn on real tragedy.\n\nI\u2019m not going to make a judgement, because I don\u2019t think Y T A. I think you are making the best call you can as a parent who never learned to understand loss of faith. This post makes me think of the Yes, Virginia There is a Santa Claus editorial. I hope you will read it and embrace a bit more spirit.\n\nDEAR EDITOR: I am 8 years old.\nSome of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus.\nPapa says, \u2018If you see it in THE SUN it\u2019s so.\u2019\nPlease tell me the truth; is there a Santa Claus?\n\nVIRGINIA O\u2019HANLON.\n115 WEST NINETY-FIFTH STREET.\n\nVIRGINIA, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men\u2019s or children\u2019s, are little. In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.\n\nYes, VIRGINIA, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus. It would be as dreary as if there were no VIRGINIAS. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.\n\nNot believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that\u2019s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.\n\nYou may tear apart the baby\u2019s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, VIRGINIA, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.\n\nNo Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.", "So I'll say NTA   \nBUT!!  \nImagen your kid going to school and the teacher asks the class what presents they hope they get from Santa this year.  \nAnd they ask your kiddo and he says \"None Santa isn't real...\" I mean that really can't be good for the other kids.

Santa gives without asking for anything in return, and we told her how Santa proves how good it can feel to be giving to others.\n\nWhen my youngest is old enough, we\u2019ll explain the same to her. We\u2019ll let them switch off moving the elf at night, so they each get a chance to look. We\u2019ll let them wrap a few gifts for each other and \u201cplay Santa\u201d for each other.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t to lie to your kids. It\u2019s to give them something small to believe in. It\u2019s to give them some fun activities with it. Most importantly, we used (and will use) it as a way to show our kids how giving is just as important as receiving.

That's what my mom did,  and we got presents from \"Santa\" until we had kids.", "You tell them that Santa is a pretend that people like to play at Christmas time, and as you get older you get to pretend to be Santa for people younger than you then you involve them in elements of the pretending, like putting out cookies or picking out gifts. Pretending isn't lying, and the first rule of pretending that kids learn is that you have to act like it is real for it to be fun. If you have ever watched Bluey think of the Shadowlands episode.", "You tell them that Santa is a pretend that people like to play at Christmas time, and as you get older you get to pretend to be Santa for people younger than you then you involve them in elements of the pretending, like putting out cookies or picking out gifts.", "Bring in Insanity Claus. We always know which \"Santa\" presents come from my dad because he signs as Insanity Claus.", ">Stuff like that is called gaslighting any other time, but when kids are poking holes in the Santa story it's seemingly okay?\n\nI mean, both things can be true. The magic of the holiday is fun, but it should be stopped when the kid is questioning. It's honestly a great way to build their reasoning skills by asking them Socratic questions. \n\n\"Why do you think Santa's handwriting looks like mom's?\"", "Honestly it just depends on the kid. There is a possibility he will feel like you, so if that's a huge concern, you shouldn't do it. But many people find out Santa isn't real and don't have any issues with it. I found out when I was 7, and while I was disappointed, I didn't hold it against my parents at all, and as an adult, I am SO glad they gave me 7 years of magic to believe in.", "My parents didn't do the whole naughty nice thing, Christmas meant presents from Santa and that was it. It wasn't a bribe to make me be \"good\". I appreciate that a lot now looking back", "Wow you don\u2019t have to be rude. This was some genuine, good advice in a post you asked for advice in.", "I mean I know non-Christian families exist... I am from one and my Boyfriend and I are definitely not Christian.  \nAnd yes that's why I said something about Christmas being about giving not receiving. That's how I view Christmas. And yes please teach Kids not to bully but it will and does happen that is the only reason I bring that up.  \nAnd yeah it is healthy to teach a difference in holiday celibrations\\~", "Good question.  I usually let their parents know ahead of time what we are doing.  If parents disagree with anything,  they have options to help us learn about what they celebrate, to skip school, or to have child out running errands when it's discussed.  My issue is with a poor student sitting there upset because \"my mom said Santa is not real.\"", "My mom was huge on the Santa gaslighting. I spent every Christmas searching the sky with her pointing \u201cCan you see him? I see him! Look!\u201d and stupid shit like that. \n\nEntirely different than playing a game of make-believe. You know, a game? Where it\u2019s consensual pretending and not straight up gaslighting.", "I told my kids that elf on the shelf is for really bad kids", "I said it in a freaking email to my whole team yesterday \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Okay, I get that. That sounds like a reaally nice idea.", "I'm saying there was nothing magical the entire time. \n\nI hated queuing up to sit on a stranger's knee and the idea of a stranger coming into my room.\n\nI didn't care about the gifts this stranger bought, and wanted to skip to the ones given by people special to me.\n\nIts each to their own, but I really don't think children are missing out if their parents choose not to have Santa sneak into their house.", "I feel wonder and love for all the things you listed.... but none of it compares to the *magic* I felt believing in Santa as a kid. When you're an adult, you know how those things work scientifically. It's not magic.\n\nMaybe I'm just being a stickler about the word \"magic,\" but I've never found anything in adulthood that's magical because I've outgrown any belief in magic, even if I find beauty in the natural world.", "My mom was very lazy about Santa (the notes on \"his\" gifts were very obviously in her handwriting), so we were never super invested in him being real, and honestly trying to disprove his existence was half the fun. Fond memories of sticking a hair over the fireplace door with my brother on Christmas Eve, so we could tell if it'd been opened the next morning.\n\nThey did try to convince my brother once when he was in preschool, by reading him the Polar Express and then getting him a \"broken\" jingle bell, but he's a natural skeptic and they're very bad actors so it fell flat.", "I'm not being rude. I actually mean that. I think it's great advice and if I saw it on a parenting book, I'd buy it. I guess the missing context here is that I've never bought a parenting book.", "That sounds like a good approach. Much better that others", "I told my kid that coffee cake tasted like coffee so she wouldn't steal mine.  Greatest regret of my life was the day I felt guilty about it and told her the truth. Little monster ate nearly my whole snack.", "I'm borrowing this one if I ever decide to have kids, thanks!", "What a great explanation as to why your house has no elf!  My youngest always wanted to know why we didn't have one.  They came out around the time I had my middle child and I felt like we had enough Christmas stuff going on and didn't want to add more to my to-do list.  Our Santa explanation was similar to yours... Santa is the spirit of giving.  When you're a kid you get the joy and excitement of receiving gifts from Santa, and as you grow up you get the joy and excitement of being Santa and giving to those you love.", "Business emails would be a lot more fun\n\n\"Hey bro, we fucked up your order. Sorry bout that. Gonna send you some free shit to make up for it. Peace.\"", "I am also starting a tradition this year of letters from Santa modeled on the JRR Tolkien letters from Santa.", "My parents are both from the southeastern US and I have a hard time even remembering that some people do *wrapped* gifts from Santa. Nothing in our family from Santa was ever wrapped. That was how you could tell! \n\nI always thought everyone did it that way. I'm literally reading this thread where other people are talking about presents labeled in their parents' handwriting, and I'm still not totally convinced people really do that. It's not that I think they're lying, it just does not compute.", "Christmas trees were not originally Christian, neither was gift giving or having a traditional meal in December.", "Santa is not just a Christian thing. Yes Christmas was traditionally \u201cChristian\u201d - well, a lot of it stolen from other religions etc - but most people in the Uk celebrate Christmas with Santa and are *not* Christian at all. None of my family are religious but Santa was the guy.", "Of course!  Praying many blessings on everyone", "It was \"hey you guys have all done diggity dope hitting those goals!\"", "Interesting. My parents and I are both from the same part of the country, and our gifts from Santa were always wrapped. My parents used brown paper and twine. My mom did the names on all the family gifts and my dad did Santa. He would also get up on the roof and stomp around to simulate Santa arriving.\n\nWe were a somewhat theatrical family. Lol", "Yep, hence why I wrote\n\n>\t(which makes sense! a lot of these traditions aren\u2019t explicitly religious in origin at all)\n\nThey\u2019re cobbled together from a lot of different cultural traditions across Europe, both pre- and post-Christian.
