{"id": 27188, "submission_id": "16mjepv", "title": "AITA for not taking my neighbor 's daughter to school?", "selftext": "I'll explain: I am a single Mom of two and work until 10 pm and I have a car. My neighbor is a stay at home mom of three, married, but has no car. During the summer, we were discussing the upcoming school year, we agreed that I could drive the kids to school in the mornings and she can pick them up in the afternoon. My neighbor doesn't have a car, so picking the kids up is walking with them to our house. All is set, right? Nope. My two kids go to elementary school. My neighbor has one in kindergarten, one in elementary and one in middle school. I get my kids ready so I can drop them off at 7:30pm. We knock at the neighbor and only one child comes out, then my neighbor tells me that her youngest is ahving a difficult time waking up and if I can drop her one child and my two at the elementary and then I come back for her and her youngest and drive them back to the same school. This happens at least 2 or 3 times a week. Then I go home for about 20 minutes and I hear a knock on my door that its time to take the neighbor's oldest child to middle school and they start at 9am. \nI finally make it home for a much needed nap before work, but noooo! My neighbor wakes me around 11am to give her a ride to pick up the kindergarten child because they get out ealier. Again this happens 2 or 3 times during the week.\nToday, I had a meeting for one of my children and it wasn't going to be finished until after 9:30am. I told her in advance so she could make other arrangements. \nSo I'm in my zoom meeting, and l'm receiving all this messages from said neighbor about how this wasn't the deal we had. And that she had to take an uber to drop her child at school and that she picks up my kids from school and she doesn't complain.  And that even though she doesn't have a job, she has things to do and gets tired too.\n\nI haven't replied to her. Because I don't want to say something rude and I dont want to start an argument, I mean we are neighbor's, so we are going to see each other for the foreseeable future.\n\nLet me explain a little more about how inconsiderate this neighbor is: every single day without fail she will stop by my house to ask to borrow: tomatoes, onion, rice, baking powder, cupcake mold, a bit of oil, a bit of dishwasher soap, avocados, etc. She texted Friday at 11pm asking if I had tortilla chips because she was cooking something, at 11pm!!! \nSo AITA for not taking the daighter to school because of my meeting? AITA if I cancel our deal? I'm seriously done with this and I already have a solution for my children.", "created_utc": 1695104794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mjepv/aita_for_not_taking_my_neighbor_s_daughter_to/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA!", "NTA Don't do this to yourself, your neighbor is a user, she takes complete advantage of you. It's one thing that you drop off a kid that goes to the same school as yours but expecting you to take her other kids to different schools at different times is super rude. I wouldn't even try to be nice to her, you do not want to be friends with a person like this. Her kids, her responsibility.", "NTA. Cancel the deal. Tell her as a working mom you can't do separate drives. You just don't have the time. If the kid is not ready, she missed her ride - and the mother should figure out something else. And since she doesn't feel that way, the deal is off. Her needs are not a match with your job.\n\nAs for the food: I would not combine the two things, since you will continue being neighboars. But you can already start by saying no, you don't have eggs - or no, you only have enough rice to last you until your next grocery run. And then at some point, tell her you can't be her emergency pantry, because you plan very precisely for your family. Twice a year, at normal times - sure. But more than that? Ask other neighbours. Or plan better. If you feel like cooking something you don't have the ingredients for, you either don't cook it, or cook it after going to the supermarket for it.", "NTA - this was never an equal exchange. She\u2019s is taking advantage of your kindness and generosity. Given the hassle of driving back and forth- plus the constant \u201cborrowing\u201d of food- this person is costing you more time and money than it would to hire someone to walk your kids home. This would be much for family - most people would have said no after the first week of these shenanigans.", "Nta , since she is your neighbor thank her for her help in the afternoons but that your plans have changed & get out of that deal before she stresses you out more !", "NTA! The deal was to bring your neighbour's daughter to school with your children. If her kid can't make it, just bring your own kids to school. She needs to make sure her kid is ready to go. You're not a service to bring her kid whenever she's ready. It's her own problem. So your neighbour is telling the truth that this isn't the deal, she's just using you. Get out of this deal asap!!", "NTA, just cancel your deal. It's only the end of September and uou already seem too beaten up by dealing with her", "NTA. If you want this to continue? \n\n\"Sorry Neighbour, but the way we are doing things isn't working. I need to be able to sleep, and I don't have the time or money to do multiple school runs. I need all your children to be up and ready for 7:30am. I will only do one run. It only takes you one run to pick up my children, so it should only take one run to drop yours off. I can't be available for any trips after 7:30am. If your kids can't get up and be ready in time, they're going to miss out and you'll have to get them to school yourself. I agreed to a school run, not a shuttle service.\"\n\nBut, really, you have a bigger problem. You've set up a relationship where, because you've helped (and presumably haven't fought back too hard) your neighbour thinks it's okay to bother you *all the time*. You need to have the hard conversation. The one where she can't be knocking on your door and messaging you for help all the time. The one where you aren't a store to get ingredients from. The one where if you have an \"emergency\" everyday you aren't having an emergency, you're failing to plan.", "NTA, stop this nonsense now otherwise you will never get a minute's peace. She chose to have  children, it's her responsibility to sort her life out.", "This deal isn't working for you, it's only a good deal for your neighbour. Your doing 2-3 extra trips and going to different schools to save yourself 1 pick up trip. Shes getting more of a benefit and she's not even grateful for it. Instead she is being entitled and not respecting your time by asking you to come back if her kids aren't ready. That's crazy talk. Cancel the deal and move on to solution B for your kids.", "Y T A for tolerating her /s\n\njokes aside, you're NTA. next time, ask her to pay for every taxi ride or every ingredient she borrows. she will automatically stop using you as her chauffeur", "Who cares if you're neighbors? She's being lazy and inconsiderate. I'd tell her to find someone else. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\n>her youngest is ahving a difficult time waking up and if I can drop her one child and my two at the elementary and then I come back for her and her youngest and drive them back to the same school\n\nNot a chance. It got even worse after that. No.", "NTA.  I'd text her \"hi (neighbor).  I find our arrangement for school drop offs and pickups isn't working for my family so I'm opting out.\". Then block her.  She has a lot of nerve expecting you to take all her kids to school.  The only one you should have ever entertained taking was the one in elementary.  I've never heard of someone taking two kids who aren't theirs to two different schools without either having their own kids in that school or being paid for their time.  She's definitely taking advantage.", "Why are you doing this?   Why are you being their mummy and hers by the sound of it.   Stop it now.   NTA at the moment but stop.", "I got a stroke from anger issues brought by this post.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nBut you would be TA for yourself and for your children if you continue to let this woman take advantage of you. How much money for gas and food is she costing you? Next thing she will hit you up for money because she is short on rent or whatever. As a single mom you need to protect your own family.", "Cancel, make other arrangements for picking up your kids", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
