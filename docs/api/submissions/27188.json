My neighbor is a stay at home mom of three, married, but has no car. During the summer, we were discussing the upcoming school year, we agreed that I could drive the kids to school in the mornings and she can pick them up in the afternoon. My neighbor doesn't have a car, so picking the kids up is walking with them to our house. All is set, right? Nope. My two kids go to elementary school. My neighbor has one in kindergarten, one in elementary and one in middle school. I get my kids ready so I can drop them off at 7:30pm. We knock at the neighbor and only one child comes out, then my neighbor tells me that her youngest is ahving a difficult time waking up and if I can drop her one child and my two at the elementary and then I come back for her and her youngest and drive them back to the same school. This happens at least 2 or 3 times a week. Then I go home for about 20 minutes and I hear a knock on my door that its time to take the neighbor's oldest child to middle school and they start at 9am. \nI finally make it home for a much needed nap before work, but noooo! My neighbor wakes me around 11am to give her a ride to pick up the kindergarten child because they get out ealier. Again this happens 2 or 3 times during the week.\nToday, I had a meeting for one of my children and it wasn't going to be finished until after 9:30am. I told her in advance so she could make other arrangements. \nSo I'm in my zoom meeting, and l'm receiving all this messages from said neighbor about how this wasn't the deal we had. And that she had to take an uber to drop her child at school and that she picks up my kids from school and she doesn't complain.  And that even though she doesn't have a job, she has things to do and gets tired too.\n\nI haven't replied to her. Because I don't want to say something rude and I dont want to start an argument, I mean we are neighbor's, so we are going to see each other for the foreseeable future.\n\nLet me explain a little more about how inconsiderate this neighbor is: every single day without fail she will stop by my house to ask to borrow: tomatoes, onion, rice, baking powder, cupcake mold, a bit of oil, a bit of dishwasher soap, avocados, etc. She texted Friday at 11pm asking if I had tortilla chips because she was cooking something, at 11pm!!! \nSo AITA for not taking the daighter to school because of my meeting? AITA if I cancel our deal? I'm seriously done with this and I already have a solution for my children.", "created_utc": 1695104794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mjepv/aita_for_not_taking_my_neighbor_s_daughter_to/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell her as a working mom you can't do separate drives. You just don't have the time. If the kid is not ready, she missed her ride - and the mother should figure out something else. And since she doesn't feel that way, the deal is off. Her needs are not a match with your job.\n\nAs for the food: I would not combine the two things, since you will continue being neighboars. But you can already start by saying no, you don't have eggs - or no, you only have enough rice to last you until your next grocery run. And then at some point, tell her you can't be her emergency pantry, because you plan very precisely for your family. Twice a year, at normal times - sure. But more than that? Ask other neighbours.

She\u2019s is taking advantage of your kindness and generosity. Given the hassle of driving back and forth- plus the constant \u201cborrowing\u201d of food- this person is costing you more time and money than it would to hire someone to walk your kids home.

The deal was to bring your neighbour's daughter to school with your children. If her kid can't make it, just bring your own kids to school. She needs to make sure her kid is ready to go.

I can't be available for any trips after 7:30am. If your kids can't get up and be ready in time, they're going to miss out and you'll have to get them to school yourself. I agreed to a school run, not a shuttle service.\"\n\nBut, really, you have a bigger problem. You've set up a relationship where, because you've helped (and presumably haven't fought back too hard) your neighbour thinks it's okay to bother you *all the time*.
