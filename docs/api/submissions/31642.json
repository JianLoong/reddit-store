They're kids, you have no idea what they got up to", "Still not a good excuse....", "Lmao so your bed can't fit a cat and two grade schoolers? This logic doesn't track", "Why does it need to be pointed out that a cat isn\u2019t rooted into the bed like a tree / a giant monster that will eat people whole if disturbed from slumber / sewed into the bedsheets such that a team of tailors would need to have been dispatched to free it from the bed before the children could take its place?\n\n**It is a cat.**\n\n(Edited for a typo.)", "why didn't you move the cat to a different room? like I'm obviously against disturbing their cuteness, but you seem excessive at how much you're unwilling to gently move the cat to a different room", "Even more YTA. You're acting like moving the cat was the end of the world you just have no respect for your children", "Why didn\u2019t you let your brothers kids sleep in your bed?", "do they sleep while doing a handstand????", "Yes, because that's the part of their bodies that comes into maximum contact with the bed. >!/s!<", "So here's the situation:\n\n1. Your cat doesn't like kids in his bed\n2. Your son doesn't like kids in his bed.\n\nYou have a choice to violate the wishes of the cat, or your son. You choose to violate the wishes of your son.\n\nPlease explain.", "so his wished are respected but your son aren't.", "Does your son?", "Does your cat pay rent? Does he go to school?\n\nOh wait, he\u2019s an animal that you can move to another room?\n\nSounds like you\u2019re making excuses defending your apathetic behavior.", "Move the cat pretty simple", "You could have put the cat in your sons room and put the kids in your bed...", "All you're proving is that every other plan you came up with was even worse than the one you implemented, not that there weren't any better solutions.", "This sounds like a dreadful cat, and I\u2019m a cat person! Seriously consider rehoming it because it\u2019s ruling the roost and you clearly value it more than your son. The cat can sleep elsewhere.", "Grow up and move the cat", "Yes, they are clean, but if you told me you would be fine with that, I would have a hard time believing that to be true.", "Life's not always fair.\ud83e\udd14", "I didn't immediately wash my sheets when my boys slept in .u bed", "That is the best feeling, isn't it. \ud83d\ude04", "Our cat hates kids", "For the millionth time - our cat was already in my bed", "Our cat refuses go sleep anywhere but our bed", "Then I wouldn't care but our cat would", "That thinking is how parents end up alone in nursing homes", "It's funny how that always goes against kids and not adults in these situations isn't it? This isn't anything else than a selfish power move. \n\nNow I happen to think because there's going to be many years in the future where life truly isn't fair, people will get sick, people will die, money will be lost through no fault of his own, food will go off before it's expiry date, bad weather will cause problems, that maybe when someone is living at home, especially under the age of 20, parents should be trying to make life as fair as possible to give someone the best start. Pulling the \"Life isn't fair\" on a man made situation is just an arsehole move.", "That was YOUR choice YOU made about YOUR space \n\nYou did not grant your son that same courtesy", "Difference is that you were asked before the boys slept in ur bed.\n\nYour son wasn't asked.\n\nIf I were to go to my bedroom, and find two guys sleeping in my bed without asking me, would it be unreasonable for me to be pissed?", "Those were YOUR children. These are his cousins, not his kids.\n\nYTA and disrespectful to your 17 year old and his space.", "And that was your choice, as was letting them in the bed. You weighed those options and decided it was more important to let your kids sleep in the bed. Your son didn't get a choice. You did all this without his permission, using your own desires as a benchmark instead of his. The definition of selfishness", "So your cat gets more respect about their space than your son?", "So? Move the cat into the 17 year olds room and have the kids sleep in your bed. Problem solved.", "Still missing the very obvious point about asking your son for permission first.... are you always this obtuse?", "Then why not remove it from the bed?", "Ok well, it seems silly that I have to explain this to you but allowing your own child whose hygiene you are responsible for to sleep in your own bed is quite different from having your bed used without your consent by two kids whose hygiene you do not supervise.", "And cats can't move?", "For the millionth time why are you so disrespectful to your children move the cat. You're excuse is so pathetic I've never seen the worst one in my life You're literally acting like the cat was unmovable like an unmovable stone grow up", "Lol that is the weakest reasoning I have ever in my life heard. You push the cat aside and find a new place for it or better yet, the fucking cat is fully capable of finding another place to sleep. You disrespected your son and his personal space in favor of a fucking cat that has the capability to find a new place to feel at home while your 17yo only has that limited space to call his own and you let someone invade it and when he tried to compromise with you by demanding you wash his sheets you double down on being a dick and start powertripping.\n\nAll this because you wouldn't move a cat. YTA big time", "OK troll, have a great night.", "So your cat has more respect from you than your give your son that\u2019s fucked up", "Clearly you prioritize your cat over your son", "lol and so does your son?", "Still, it does not excuse that you did not ask your son for permission. That is the part you don't seem to understand. That you should have asked him first.", "Why don't you go live in a shelter since the cat is so important", "Ikr, what the fuck? I have 4 cats and 2 dogs, I love them all dearly and they all sleep on the bed/couches etc and are spoiled but just move the fucking cat? What a stupid excuse. OP didn't want two kids that aren't his own in his bed so dumped them in his son's and is now wondering why his son is pissed", "*Ding ding ding!*", "The cat didn't have to stay on the bed.", "Or the bathroom. Jeez it'll be fine.", "It's  a bed, not a toothbrush", "Our cat would had torn those kids apart", "I have cats too, and if they\u2019re in the way.. Move them! They\u2019ll be fine and curl up wherever you plop them", "Well, not everyone has the same casual feeling about their beds as you.", "ITS NOT YOUR GODDAMN BED IT'S YOUR SON'S.  \nYOU ARE SUPPOSED TO ASK PERMISSION WHEN YOU LEND OTHER PEOPLE'S BED'S.  \nITS CALLED \"MANNERS\"", "But it wasn't your bed either. Why can't you understand that you crossed a boundary. Your son is 17 and should have some level of privacy and rights to his own space.", "Cats. Can. Be. Moved.", "Then move it? \n\nI love how you somehow think your son will still want to hang out with you when he moves out. You've made it clear you don't respect him, so why would he continue to spend time with you? You're jeopardizing your relationship because you couldn't find a suitable solution to a very simple situation.", "Is he glued down to the bed? Are you purposefully obtuse?\n\nWhy can the cat have his preference but not your own literal human child? Bro. Get your priorities straightened up."]}
