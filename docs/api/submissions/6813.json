What is wrong is believing people should be going 7 days a week without taking time for themselves or else they are unwell", "Your mum sounds amazing! Wish mine would do the same, she's one of those that believes the only truly acceptable time to sleep is between 10pm and 7am. Anything else is wrong, possibly even immoral, and is bound to be unhealthy, according to her \ud83d\ude44", "I'm a boomer smack in the middle of the curve and I feel guilty about lying in bed and browsing Reddit on my off days.\n\n  \n\n\nI still do it though :)", "I work from home mostly and I wear pjs until like noon (which is when I\u2019m ready to be out of pjs). It\u2019s fantastic. I can wear whatever I want to and I love it.", "For all you know they work a physically demanding job, work out every weekday, or are otherwise very active. 2 days off isn't going to hurt them. Also, for all we know, they could have some sort of chronic illness or pain.", "you have NO idea how much people like that frustrate me! LIKE HELLO 2nd and 3rd shift exists! if people didn't work at night and sleep during the day, things would crash! I've seen so many posts about people with family harassing them to wake up only a few hours into sleep. my DSPD is most likely an evolutionary adaptation to make sure that someone is awake at all times to earn the group, too. my mom REALLY hasn't been the best but I'm glad she's on my side with stuff like this. with nightshifts you just have to make sure you get proper rest, vitamin D, and UV days. it's perfectly healthy but some people just WILL NOT absorb that information. like who cares what time you do stuff, as long as it's done!!", "Sch\u00f6nen Kuchentag aus Australien!", "No.  Well, in the neonazi circles they are.  This person is either trying to normalize this kind of thing or trying to be provocative.", "The one in my town pays minimum wage but that\u2019s not saying much since minimum wage is at or below poverty line.", "NTA: that said, I'd wonder if my daughter was sick or depressed or had some other issue that kept her in bed. But I would say that instead of criticizing.", "NAH you\u2019re absolutely more than entitled to do whatever you like asking as you\u2019re not hurting anyone and if that means staying in bed all weekend then so be it. \nMy only thought is that while this is cool now, would you like this to be your pattern in life indefinitely. Perhaps this is what your dad was getting at, though it may have come across in a way where it seems a criticism. I guess parents can and will try and guide their children. \nThey still can\u2019t tell you what to do, but they might have felt they were trying to help. \nEnjoy your weekends\u2026 and if you\u2019ve got any good recommendations on Netflix let us know!", "People seem to be judging this based on your right to lie in bed or your dad wanting to give you advice.\n\nBut the issue, and the reason I believe you posted this, is with how you ended the call.  Yeah, that was sort of an AH thing to do.  You could have just explained everything and left it at that.\n\nYTA", "i see this as a selfish, bourgeois way to live that wastes your skilled time, a resource that could be given back to the community, the society or the family that helped lift you up.\n\nfrom this perspective, it is everybody's business - in your community and family - that you are in good mental health and lay in bed all weekend.  it is everybody's job to police and judge your behavior, to interpret it as slothful and decadent, deviant in that it harms society simply by withholding a resource your community has invested in, yourself.\n\nYTA", "I don't know if YTA necessarily, but you know whether your father is or not. Sounds like he is trying to encourage you men just have a harsh way about it.", "YTA, not for lifestyle, but for your words, you choose, to answer.", "Wait until your old and alone with a baron womb", "I really don't understand the logic that some people attribute sickness and depression to wanting to relax on their days off.", "Okay, and if you were really worried would you make some passive aggressive comments and then call your daughter ridiculous and lazy? Because if I were worried about someone I loved I\u2019d ask them how they were and if everything was okay instead of passing judgement on them.", "I've explained this situation to him hundreds of times over the years, and warned him that if he continues to make digs, the conversation will be over.

That said, maybe he's worried (shit, I'm worried) that spending every weekend all day in bed on your phone and watching Netflix isn't the most healthy thing. If you're happy and healthy, then I would reassure him of that.", "Relaxing and not getting out of bed is different. You can relax outside with a good book, relax on the sofa, cooking a yummy meal, relaxing at the park or relaxing kicking a ball around, learn or play on the computer. Laying in bed all day and struggling to get the motivation to do other things is a sign of depression. It is usually unhealthy to lay for long periods without standing and when people are sick they usually use bed rest to recover because they don't feel well enough to sit or stand up and do things. There is a lot of logic there.", "At work? Or after work with non work people. Because colleagues can feel like you are close, but they aren't actually your friends.", "Nah, not narrow at all. You burn 2000 cal, that\u2019s normal daily activity without exercise. And the weekend is 2/7th of your life, you can\u2019t mail that much time in and be as healthy as you could be.

It doesn't mean they aren't healthy.", "They already do that anyway so might as well call 'em boomers", "Wow, I can see why your dad got pissy lol. It's not what you're saying, it's how you're saying it.", "Colleagues aren't friends, unfortunately. Many people have to learn that the hard way.", "I remember visiting a camp with that inscription. The guide said that SS officers would \u2018joke\u2019 that the only way out is through the chimney.\n\nI really don\u2019t like that phrase.", "I am well aware of this. I've asked you nicely not to patronise me and you've continued to do so. Welcome to my block list", "Yes you\u2019re correct. Still not good to lay in bed for 2 days straight despite all that.", "I\u2019m not a student, but someone who\u2019s had different morning schedules this past year, I have to say that starting work at 10 is just the right time. You\u2019re mentally and physically ready.", "I am American and definitely learned all about the holocaust, and I didn\u2019t know this phrase."]}
