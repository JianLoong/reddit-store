I don\u2019t get dressed, I just hang out with the house monsters, maybe clean, cook a big meal in the morning and eat it all day and just bum around doing whatever I feel like.\n\nThese are what my dream weekends are made of!", "Work will set you free. But it's always the bosses that are saying that.", "Hyperbole", "Well good thing you're not her father then. SMH", "I'm a boomer, and Sundays are always pajama days. I can nap if I want to. My bills are paid", "I\u2019m 53. If I don\u2019t have something to do that takes me out of the house, I don\u2019t get out of my pajamas. Period.", "My late father is a boomer and would get annoyed if I lazed around in my Jammies. So would my paternal grandmother and most of my dad's family. They find it unacceptable to be lazy for any reason, even if you have nothing to do. One of the reasons I don't like dealing with that side of the family much, aside from them being neurotic.", "Teenagers\u2019 brains are essentially permanently jet lagged by hormonal changes as they grow.\n\nIt\u2019s unsurprising your 12yo daughter struggles to sleep early and get up early.", "My dad would not let us sleep past 9 as kids. Over break we were at their house and my 12 year old slept til noon. My siblings were taking bets on how long she would sleep and how many times my dad would mention her being asleep. 15 times after 10 (that we heard. Mom says it he said something to her more). Youngest brother won $75.  He took her out for ice cream to celebrate.", "It's not as straightforward or this. Some people are strongly on one end or the other, some are more in-between. Many extroverts can easy get all of their social needs met Monday-Friday. I know a number of extroverts who schedule in weekends at home with no plans once a month because they do actually need that downtime but left to their own devices won't get it (like many introverts do benefit from social activity, but might not seek it out unless they push themselves). I wish everything weren't seen in such a binary way!", "Am introvert, can confirm! It\u2019s not about the bed, it\u2019s about not getting bothered by other people.", "Your standards are NOT everyone else\u2019s standards.  Some parents demand their kids make straight As and some just want their kids to do their best.", "You're the one who said it was swearing, lol", "Your assumptions are not my problem. You think I'm going to lie about how I spend my free time because it's what *you* would 'prefer'? Lol, the audacity.", "I am sure, thanks.", "All of these comments are so validating! I do this whenever I have the chance on weekends too, but there\u2019s still that little nagging inner dialogue telling me that I should feel guilty for doing it. It\u2019s like 95% relaxation, 5% guilt.", "The fact they don\u2019t follow their own advice is more than enough to discount it.", "I love this! May as well have some fun out of it lol.", "I wish I could like this more than once. That's absolutely fantastic!", "It\u2019s a spectrum, sure, and fully ambivert (in the middle) people exist who aren\u2019t drained/recharged by social interactions much either way, never said otherwise, but most people who are extroverts wouldn\u2019t want to spend every weekend in bed alone like OP wants! Unless they had a really strenuous job etc and then they\u2019re probably not as happy as they could be in general. \n\nIdk if I agree with the \u201cpush yourself\u201d thing. As an introvert, if I have to push myself it\u2019s not recharging my battery! I can socialize in small groups with close friends without pushing myself, and introverts don\u2019t generally get drained being around all/any people (just being around a lot of people and/or strangers) as introverted isn\u2019t about pure aloneness and lots of companionship suits introverts. I think extroverts often say it\u2019s good for introverts to push themselves because they think of introversion as social anxiety or shyness, but you can be anxious or shy and an extrovert too etc. Just wouldn\u2019t be that happy about it! All introvert/extrovert really means is if you\u2019re drained or recharged by social interactions, particularly outside a comfy inner circle. I do find sometimes people think they\u2019re extroverts but they\u2019re always dying for alone time and just think you have to be shy or awkward or antisocial to be an introvert, but they may actually not be as extroverted as they think, they more mean they\u2019re confident or socially successful.", "Your title and post strongly imply you work all week and lay in bed all weekend. It doesn\u2019t mention having and active social life at all.", "Generally speaking when someone uses shitty and/or aggressive language looking for \"intent\" is the last thing I want to do. If dear old dad meant well he wouldn't have been berating her for doing her own thing on her own weekend in her own home that doesn't impact him in any way.", "Good point! Socialist sukinsyn coming out here, but just because relaxation doesn't produce something for an employer doesn't mean it's not productive. Work is hard and no one can pour from an empty cup. Normalize valuing relaxation as a vital part of a balanced life.", "That's why there's an option to ask for information, rather than make assumptions.", "Sorry, it was someone else speaking in first person that I attributed to you. Definitely NTA. No one has the right to tell a grown adult what to do.", "It was mentioned in one of the comments.", "Gotcha. Sorry. I thought you were saying it was an insecurity, not them projecting insecurity on you. Definitely NTA then. You are an adult and free to do what you want with your time."]}
