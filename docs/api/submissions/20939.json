A lot of kids try dog food at some point, and as you say, the ingredients aren't harmful to humans.

If your nephew is 4 or less or close to age 4, YATA. If your nephew is 10 or thereabouts or older YNTA. Kids at a certain age understand that they have a choice to do stupid or questionable things and IMO should be allowed to do those things within reason because it is their choice as long as it is relatively harmless. By age 10 they question arbitrary adult rules and rightly so. A small child is still learning what is standard acceptable behavior which is valuable to know and needs more feedback and more careful tending. If the kid is in the spectrum or intellectually disabled they also need much more careful tending and more careful explanations of why we don't do certain things for a longer span of time.\n\nWould you eat the dog treats?

The fact is that, even though dog food manufacturers aren't (in practice) held to the same standards as human food manufacturers, it was quite unlikely that the dog treat would harm the child.\n\nThe problem is that this isn't his kid, and dog treats are not intended for human consumption. If the parents didn't give him any instructions about diet, that means that any human foods should be ok, but the default assumption is that something that's not meant for human consumption isn't going to be fed to your kid.\n\nTo turn it around a little, what if the parents had been vegetarian, but had not informed OP of that and then they had gotten upset when OP fed them a hot dog? In that case, they would be the AH, because the default assumption is that foods meant for human consumption are ok.\n\nI don't think OP had any bad intentions, but giving someone else's kid something that a pretty substantial part of the population will find disgusting is a poor decision.", "Nta", "As a mother I wouldn\u2019t be happy about it but NTA kids want to try stuff.
