Pet food is completely different and that is why it can not be on the same shelves as human food. Not the same at all", "Yeah, it's not like he sat him down and said, here's your lunch.", "I am in the US and every bag of food and treats I have (5 brands) say \"Not safe for human consumption\". So there goes your hypothesis.", "Once again there\u2019s common sense that needs to be applied \n\nEven if a child asks to eat the dog food you refuse them wtf", "Even in modern day times, chicken feet is considered a delicacy in certain places eg my country and is often served in dim sum places.\n\nAs for eyeballs, I can't confirm but I heard that in my part of the world, guests of honors are served eyeballs from a whole fish... Though I've never experienced it.\n\nAnd as for organs, it is used for food often enough that there is a name for it - offal.\n\nIf people have an issue with chicken meal because it could have bones and whatnot mixed into it, then I don't think they want to know what goes into their hotdogs, burgers, nuggets etc.", "I sure hope so, and it's not feeding live chickens into a grinder!", "so are the ones that went into your chicken nuggets, but they don't want to talk about that...", "Maybe vitamin C? Dogs and most other mammals can synthesize their own vitamin C in the liver. Humans (and guinea pigs) are unusual in that we have to get vitamin C from our food.", "Probably Taurine. That\u2019s why cats can\u2019t survive long term on only dog food or on a vegetarian diet, they lack taurine.", "This was my thought. He let him try one and explained that he couldn\u2019t have more because they\u2019re for dogs. He didn\u2019t give him the box and let him go ham like they\u2019re cookies.\n\nSide note I have an uncle who tried both beggin strips and snausages because he wanted to see if they actually tasted like bacon and sausage. They don\u2019t.", "Yes you\u2019re right, it was vitamin C. Thanks!", "Both of my brothers used to eat cat food like it was frigging Cheez-Its.

As soon as she learned to toddle around she\u2019d get handfuls of the dry kibble kind, my parents had to put it up on a shelf out of her reach. She also enjoyed fish food(the flakes) a few years later, she had to be supervised feeding them when my parents realized why the food was running out so fast.", "BiL is the asshole. You used poor judgment for sure but the reaction from the parents was assholeworthy. They should have laughed it off. I\u2019m going to assume your BiL is bitter and ungrateful in life.", "Against the norm here.. but NTA. They would have got one anyway if they really wanted it. You didn\u2019t stock the kid up on dog treats, and I bet if they have a dog at home, that they have eaten more dog food than the parents think. At least if the kid has an eating issue, they now have guidelines. \nThis made me laugh, so thank you for that.\n\nEdit: As a parent to a 4yo, I wouldn\u2019t go off about it. I would sooooo appreciate your honesty. I have in-laws that fluff about lollies.", "NTA. Unconventional, yes. Harmful? No. You checked the ingredients of the treat and well, let him try it. I like the way you think.\n\nI can relate, in a way. I lived in a town where we had to bring our trash to the local dump every week. One week my 5 yo son was with me and we saw a (non-motorized) scooter leaned up against the facility.  So, I brought it home. My son rode it around and proudly told everyone \"Mom found it at the dump!\" \n\nOkay, a bit embarrassing, but we lived through it. Heck the scooter was in perfect condition!", "Trying dog treats was pretty normal kid behavior for my generation (boomer), but we were unsupervised and just did it ourselves. Didn\u2019t ask permission. And they didn\u2019t taste as good as they looked, haha. NTA. You checked ingredients, let him try. You weren\u2019t \u201cfeeding him dog food,\u201d for god\u2019s sake. That\u2019s an over reaction. \n\nI\u2019m just surprised the kid liked it. What kinds of food are they feeding him if he thinks dog treats are tasty, is what I want to know. (JK. I haven\u2019t tried a dog treat since I was like 5, so maybe they have improved. Not going to verify, however.)", "DOG FOOD??\n\nYTA", "YTA. Don't feed children dog food while babysitting. You are the adult. You don't just give children something they ask for, even if technically it might not kill him. Children  are stupid and ask for stupid stuff. Learn to use say no.", "YTA. Massive one at that. You literally fed another human, dog food.", "YTA and if I were them you would never be alone with my child again. You could have easily said they are not for people and given him a snack or something else to take his mind off of it. You are disgusting and I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw you.", "As a parent, yes, you are.", "Nice to see a sensible answer... kinda sad I had to scroll a bit to get to one. Most of the posts I've read so far are arguing about whether dog treats are fit for human consumption, lol.", "I ate half a bowl of cat kibble when I was like 5. I vividly remember making sure that my mother wouldn't see me do it, and thinking it wasn't half bad for cat food.", "You need to make a judgement.", "My mom feeds their dogs a homemade diet. She makes rice, and adds veggies and meat. Usually turkey or chicken, because one of the dogs is allergic to beef and pork.\n\nWhen my daughter was little, rice was her favorite thing in the world! One day, she asked if she could have \u201cPuppy Rice,\u201d and my mom let her have some! She loved it and ate it all the time! We were always so afraid we\u2019d get a call from someone, asking if we actually let my Mom feed her dog food! Lol", "Yeah. When I was younger I ate rocks.", "Lucky. Here in Canada it's technically also true by law, but there isn't actually anyone regulating it. \n\nI remember way back there was a big recall because some major companies were using euthanized animals in their dog dood/treats and the leftover chemicals were killing dogs. It was labeled as \"meat meal\" without specifying the animal.\n\nEDIT: I tried to find an article but it's probably been buried pretty good. [Here](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38888399) is one similar occasion in the USA though.", "When I was 7 or 8, I was very upset that they labeled them things like \"Chicken and Bacon\" when they clearly tasted nothing like them.\n\nBeing the scientist I was, I tried multiple kinds. They're all lying.", "Food and drink tasters usually don't swallow because of the quantity they are tasting.   : )   Nothing to do with nutritional value, taste, etc.", "I was talking to the manager of a pet store about dog food. She had recently been to a conference. At the Halo dog food booth they were giving tasters of the wet dog food. She said it was warmed up in a crockpot and it was good.", "Have been in vet med ~13yr and this is the first I\u2019m hearing of this. I HIGHLY doubt we are regulating this in the US- the foods often have recalls because they\u2019re not even fit for canine consumption.", "Lmao I feel like it was one of those \"it tastes like it smells and it smells like clay\" because even my mom have him the side eye about clay. \n\nThe funniest part to me about all this is that my brother was the PICKIEST eaters alive but he was fully willing to try the dog treat \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "Oof. This thread was hilarious until this part. Insert picture of me crying in American.", "The kid wasn\u2019t fed dog treats they wanted to eat one and were given one, and there\u2019s a huge difference between the two. \n\nIf the kid was fed a dog treat it would be dehumanizing, but giving one to him after they asked for it ( and making sure it\u2019s safe) is just respecting the kid\u2019s agency.", "No you didn't say it specifically, but you said it to imply that the different process made it not fit.\n\nWhat is it with people on here lately thinking replying with a weak semantic argument despite it being clear in the context?\n\nIt's almost like people can't handle disagreement and don't know how to respond intelligently and instead go route one petty.", "It seems like curiosity got the kiddo at the end haha", "It wasn\u2019t clear in the context, you made an assumption.  You\u2019re now telling me why I said something or was saying something to imply something else.  That wasn\u2019t my point, that it\u2019s actually unfit but that I wouldn\u2019t assume it WAS fit or acceptable to feed to someone else\u2019s child, certainly without asking.", "Well it was a clear implication the way you wrote it. If that wasn't what you meant to say that's your problem not mine.", "Friend and I tried cat food one day at my house. Guess how I found out I'm allergic to shellfish?", "My uncle tried snausages once too!! He also said they\u2019re gross lol", "My kids both tried my dad's dog's treats. They were kept in the kitchen in a low drawer because they had trained their dog how to \"show us where the treats are.\" It was a really cute and cool trick, but it was also at kid level. My kids are now grown and have each admitted to sneaking a dog treat to try.  Lol. Neither of them were impressed.", "Mine has always stolen my coffee haha. Of course I like it kinda sweet so.", "I did not get the joke but now that I do, its hilarious. Thank you for holding my hand and walking me through it. I appreciate you!!!!", "It\u2019s not my problem, it\u2019s your incorrect interpretation and that\u2019s fine.  Fit or not, you got the point that it\u2019s a stretch to feed someone else\u2019s child pet food, of any kind.", "Those fish food flakes actually tasted amazing, I dont think my parents ever tried to stop me from eating those.", "People in here are acting like the dog food ia actually a bomb. From the bomb factory. And the kid will blow up before sunset if he eats it.", "If they are in the US, I can guarantee it.", "I came here to say this. Its a soft YTA because ultimately no harm, no foul. But OP really should have said something like \" It's not up to me to give you one of these. Ask your parents when they get home.\" I know overall it was harmless, but if someone did this with my kid I'd be left wondering \"Well, what else would they let them try?\"", "My grandma and other non English immigrants have eaten cat food in the US without issues. Since they didn\u2019t know English they would take the can that showed the fish thinking it was tuna, without realizing it was cat food. Even after learning it was cat food my grandma told my mom that some people would choose to continue eating it because they liked it.", "The data they\u2019re talking about is from 23 years ago.", "My thought exactly. He needs to be quarantined for eating one dog treat! He's radioactive!", "I am of a strong opinion that children should explore all their senses for good development. If a child is curious what petroleum jelly tastes like, there's no reason you shouldn't give them some.  \n\nSo in this case, maybe a whole treat is too much (depending on size). But OP wasn't an asshole for letting a kid try."]}
