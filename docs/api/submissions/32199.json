If someone is that adamant about not being around my dogs, then my house is not the place for us to have a visit. I was debating which way to go on this, bc your sister should not have agreed to lock them up and then pull a bait and switch, but I don't have her side of the story, and ultimately, it's on the person who doesn't like dogs to not go to someone's house if they have dogs.", "NTA she lied to you.

It's perfectly normal to ask your sister to move her dogs to a separate room, even if they weren't obnoxious, you have young children and I assume both dogs are well over 40 pounds if they're retrievers, which makes them large animals.

Goldens are always much bigger and stronger than I expected, and although I love their happy attitudes, they can be really needy, in your face dogs.", "It'd be different, if you like came over uninvited and started making demands, but this was something that was agreed to on the phone. She broke her promise.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She lied to you. \n\nAlso, as a dog lover putting them away wasn't a massive request. Dogs have a tendency to get too excited around 'new' people and kids. For my peace of mind and anxiety most of the dogs I've lived with get crated or gated off. The one exception was Esme, an angel of a Shar Pei that we called catdog because she didn't care at all about anything lol.", "NTA.  She should have been upfront with you about her unwillingness to sequester the dogs.  I suppose she thought you\u2019d cave after the long drive.  She has a right to set the rules in her house, sure, but you equally have a right to accept them and enter her residence, or reject them and find something else to do.", "NTA.

They love receiving love, to the point that they get obnoxious. They don\u2019t settle, they run around all crazy and they make all sorts of noise. That\u2019s why they get given their favourite rib bones as a treat and sent to the shop for a couple hours while we have guests. They have beds, water, toys and of course their bones to keep them happy. And then that way no one accidentally gets hurt or annoyed and I\u2019m able to enjoy the company without having to be on edge the entire time! I love my dogs, but separating them from visitors for a little bit isn\u2019t going to hurt them. Your sister could\u2019ve accommodated that without acting like they\u2019re hurting the dogs.", "If dogs jump on a small child it can injure them and cause them to fear dogs forever. NTA.

Long visits? That\u2019s less reasonable. A couple hours is perfectly acceptable.\n\nShe agreed to this ask, but then refused after you drove 2 hours there with 2 small children. She lied to you and thought you\u2019d just give in.", "NTA, you set a clear boundary and it seems like she thought the 2hr drive would \"trap\" you there so she could ignore it freely.\n\nI guess you won't be visiting at her place anymore, now she knows.", "NTA.

I adore my dog. LOVE LOVE LOVE HER. She is not good with children. So when my nephews visit from out-of-state? She gets boarded. When I have her at my mom\u2019s house and the nephews come over? She hangs out in a bedroom with access to food and water and occasional bathroom breaks. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t harm my dog in the slightest and it keeps something bad from happening with the kids. Her instinct is to run when she\u2019s anxious but she could still inadvertently hurt them trying to get away, so we don\u2019t chance it. \n\nThis is a reasonable boundary for you to set. She can also choose not to comply with that boundary, but she gets to deal with the consequences.", "NTA, the first thing I ask anyone coming to our house is if they are OK with big dogs, if not, our great dane can sleep upstairs or hang out in the backyard. She lied about it, and sure, it's her dogs, her house, but you could have met at a park, etc.", "NTA, your sister said she would do one thing and did the opposite. Although I agree that a home is also the dogs/pets, she agreed to put them away in another area of the house before y'all came by. The fact that she didn't keep her end of the bargain is pretty uncool, especially with small children involved. She could've suggested something else, like meeting up at a park or even dropping her dogs off at a doggy daycare/groomer for a few hours so her house would be free of them for y'all to visit. There were so many options, it's a shame she decided to be dishonest and disrespect a boundary that you not only made clear but had a discussion with her about beforehand.", "NTA I think they should get 3 crates - one for each of the dogs, and one for your sister. She's the one whose behavior is out of control.", "NTA", "Idk I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable at ALL to invite someone with tiny kids to your house and expect them to be okay with quite large dogs around the kids. Even the most well intentioned golden retriever dog is bigger than a one year old. I have two labradors they are lovely with children they are gentle sweet and patient with children however today my sister in law is being my three nieces to my house the middle one is four and my dogs are twice the size of her easy, the smallest one is 9 months old. There\u2019s zero chance I\u2019d let my dogs have free range of the house with such little people in it, even the best intentions from a dog can be clumsy or scary for a tiny kid. Also my two have zero inclination of their actual size or weight and literally no spacial awareness so they will reverse and step on a kid or turn round and whip someone with their tails.\n\nSorry I\u2019m all for having dogs meet kids in a controlled environment but everyone has to be on board and big enough to deal with the animal especially when they\u2019re this stupid, and ops children are simply too little. If the sister didn\u2019t want to shut her dogs away she shouldn\u2019t invite tiny children to her home and promise to do the thing she won\u2019t do. She\u2019s unreasonable.", "I agree, NTA. For me it boils down to sister lying and putting the kids in an environment/situation that OP had made clear was unacceptable.\n\nOP, you were not controlling. You made a request, sister agreed to it, sister went back on her word, and you left an environment that did not meet a very specific standard that your sister had agreed to. At this point, sister's lying is what bothers me the most. She tricked you into putting yourself and your family in a situation she knew made you uncomfortable and feel unsafe.", "Yeah, as you can tell, fellow dog owner here. I have put my dogs in a room or crated them as a situation dictates. Sister was a crazy AH.\n\nOP made a request, she agreed, and then she didn't follow up and was outraged when called out for her bad decisions by OP's decision (rightly so in my opinion) to leave.\n\nAlso, when my younger brother was a tot, my grandparents had a 50ish # misbehaving dog that jumped on my younger brother who was sleepy after the long ride, pushed him into a corner and split his head open. So he spent the first hours of the visit in ER getting his head shaved and stitches put in.\n\nGoldens aren't small dogs and they can push around toddlers without trying. OP made a smart choice.", "Exactly. It's not about liking/not liking dogs, it's about lying. If she said she wasn't ok with putting them in a separate room OP could've made an informed decision about whether or not to go round. Sounds like sis thought that if she manipulated the situation OP would realise how amazing her dogs are and change his mind.", "Normally I don't support people who expect pet owners to lock up their pets in their own homes. However, from the sound of it this pet owner has not trained her animals and they are obnoxious and upsetting to guests. If you're going to let your animals run wild then don't lie to people when you say that you will make sure they are not a nuisance. When your animals are a nuisance I don't always think it's pandering for guests to request not to be jumped on, slobbered on, tangled up and tripped when they come for a visit. It sounds like that is what the real problem is here, a lousy, incompetent pet owner who doesn't care what trouble her animals get into.", "I mean OP asked a question and if the sister felt it was such a rude thing, why did she agree to it? He was free to ask and she was free to refuse. Him enquiring about it doesn\u2019t necessarily make him an AH. She refusing also wouldn\u2019t have but her lying and springing this on OP at the last min definitely does", "There is nothing rude about asking someone to put their dogs in another room.", "I agree I only ever see the benefit to securing a pet to a room if it\u2019s for their safety and not for the guests.   As in small kids pulling on dogs ears and tail.  If anything the kids should have been the ones to be worried about. \n\nInstead of agreeing to go to the house they could have met up at a restaurant or a park.  The meetup could have been at OP\u2019s house.  There were ways to avoid being around dogs. \n\nWhile I agree that the Sister lied to OP and that was not ok.  She is right though it\u2019s the dogs home not her niblings.", "Not OP, but my dad bred and raised goldens (he also trained them for bird hunting) when I was kid so I have lots of experience with the breed. They\u2019re my favorite because ours were always submissive and incredibly gentle with kids. Zero aggression.\n\nThat said, they were bred carefully and trained young. They love to jump and wag their tails wildly and I got more than one welt on my leg from being lashed by a (strong) tail accidentally. If young and untrained? Yes, you can assume they will accidentally hurt small children like OP\u2019s, not because of aggression, but strength and energy. My dad *never* allowed them around little ones until trained. \n\nA golden that lacks manners will also try and snatch your guests\u2019 things (retrieving) like scarfs, shoes, etc. They will drool/lick on your pant leg/shoes. Their nails will scratch you. They will run between your legs and trip you up. They\u2019re like a big, awkward teenager who wants to wrestle like he\u2019s five years old, but he\u2019s got strength now and not much coordination or control. Good intentions, but very rude and quite possibly painful. \n\nWhen trained (and healthy, I\u2019ve heard of goldens with health issues nipping someone) they are delightful. Unbelievably gentle with even the smallest child. That said, no dog is truly a \u201cnanny dog,\u201d never leave them alone, etc. But our last one, Molly came close, in fact she wouldn\u2019t even harm a squirrel or a rabbit. Zero prey drive. I hate hearing about untrained goldens, what a waste of a potentially ideal family companion.", "They have toddlers and she has dogs that don't listen That's not nothing. \n\nShe agreed to put them away while the family was visiting.\n\nShe lied to them. If she had no intention of putting the dogs up then she should have said that when they asked.\n\nJust because it's her house doesn't mean her guests have to tolerate her dog's misbehavior.", "The sister could\u2019ve easily communicated this to OP which she chose not to and essentially deceived him. She single handedly could have avoided this mess if she  had said a simple NO when she was \u201casked\u201d about it. \n\nOP is NTA and his sister is TA for me", "There is nothing rude about asking someone to put their dogs in another room.", "Not visiting was OP's plan until their sister openly lied to them to trick them into making a two hour drive.", "A Marine that can turn anyone into an enemy over just about anything. Classic. You're going to be just fine.", "OP is NTA. He asked his sister to remove the dogs and she lied and told him she would, and based on that info made a long trip with two toddlers. What does your own dog have to do with any of this?", "I think the point they were trying to make is that it would have been okay for sister to say that she cannot lock the dogs up and cannot host OP in her house without the dogs. Then they can meet at OP's or somewhere else. \n\nI don't think they disagree that lying and manipulating was unreasonable.", "I think it depends on the dog. Oz, may he rest in peace, was a bull mastiff/Rottweiler mix. He was well over 150 pounds. He also allowed all the kids to crawl all over him. My daughter routinely dressed him up as a princess. While huge, he was very chill. He made my daughter cry twice. Once because she stepped on his pe***. And to be fair he just growled at her. The other time was because she was sitting on him and he stood up and walked with her on his back.\n\nAnd before anyone gets on me, DD was TINY. As in didn't hit 20 pounds until almost 2. She fell off the weight chart.", "I have 2 rambunctious dogs who i ADORE, if someone requests they be put up while they visit, I do it- dogs are den creatures and are comfortable snoozing in their crate if you made sure to train them.\n\nI think the sister is a not great dog owner, didn\u2019t train them, and now they\u2019re a nuisance to guests. Furthermore, two untrained dogs with two toddlers? Toddlers don\u2019t understand boundaries and are prone to crossing them with animals, which can result in injuries, especially if the dogs are untrained, unsocialized. \n\nIf she wants to spend time with family, she can set up a trip to hang out with them in the area so the dogs can stay free roaming, or put them away. There are so many solutions, lying isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nNTA. I would curb this from happening again by just not meeting her in her house anymore. She\u2019s already shown she\u2019s not above lying to try and force you to comply (im sure she thought you would suck it up so you didn\u2019t drive for nothing) there is nothing stopping her from doing it again, or finding some other way to weasel you into it.", "I agree with the first half of your statement. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask that untrained dogs be kept away from a 1 and 3 year old. If the dogs won\u2019t leave the adults alone, I wouldn\u2019t want my babies around them either. Recipe for disaster.", "Then, the sister shouldn't have lied and visited op or offered another solution like meeting at a cafe or park without the dogs. If she wanted to see her nephews, after they drove 2 hours to see her, sister would have made the effort. Instead, she tried playing a power game to see if she would get her way.", "And op probably will never go back.", "It is completely reasonable to ask that two rambunctious large dogs be separated from toddlers whose face is at mouth height and in seconds things can easily go wrong. If she wants to see her nieces and nephews and wants them to come to her then she can put the dogs away. We don\u2019t even know if the dogs are actually safe with toddlers.", "My aunt had no children (by choice) so they treated their dogs better than anyone. We just chose not to go to their home because they refused to lock them up (they were mean). And they didn\u2019t visit us often because we refused to allow their mean dogs around ours. It worked because there were other places we could meet up ;they lived a couple hour drive from us so that\u2019s why they wanted tot bring their dogs).", "If you invite people to your place you have to take them into consideration. Not everyone loves dogs. I have a large dog and I automatically put him in my bedroom if someone needs to come down. Sister thought she would drop the bomb on the dogs staying and didn\u2019t think he would drive all the way back home.", "You can\u2019t be serious. It\u2019s okay to ask. It\u2019s okay to say no. I do not lock my dogs up for holidays because it\u2019s their home and they do not jump or beg, but I do lock them up when a contractor comes into the home for everyone\u2019s safety. \n\nIf someone asked me to lock them up for a fear related issue, I\u2019d keep them behind a gate. Allergies I couldn\u2019t accommodate and would offer to meet at a restaurant.", "I have a staffy and a spoodle and as much as I trust and love them they are also large dogs and I will always supervise them with my nephew 3yr. Because neither they or the toddler know better. And I am more than happy to put the dogs outside or in a room as long as my guests don\u2019t mind listening to my girl cry and whine cause she wants to be where the people are \ud83d\ude05", "Then the sister should have said the same, not lied. If she wasn\u2019t okay with putting them up she could have just said so.", "Your situation has nothing to do with this story at all.", "Why do you have so many main character posts about *your dog* and *your story* in someone else's thread? Like... this is not about you, if you need to talk about your dog, you can make your own post somewhere?", "Why do you feel the need to insert your story into the OP's story? You must nor have many friends and close relationships with that attitude.", "What a useless comment showing how absurd you cater to your dog.", "Did you know that this isn\u2019t about you?", "Do you always try this hard to make things about you?", "I think the sister was dead wrong. But, its in my first post on the subject. She lied. She should never have tried to manipulate him. The asking someone to put a dog in another room things was a complete aside.\n\n(But you wouldn't ask a person to put their child in another room when you visit. That's the reason its considered (by the etiquette mavens,) to be an unfriendly/impolite ask. Personally, I thinks its fine of people to ask each other if their relationship is close enough to support it. I just gave *one* example of when its a rude ask. Situations vary, of course.) \n\nHowever, OP's sister should never have tried to manipulate him into visiting by promising to put her rowdy dogs away. She was wrong. I'd link to my original post - but its unnecessary.", "My dog wasn't rambunctious though. And like I said my friend just thinks dogs shouldn't actually reside indoors. She thinks that's nasty. That's her business to manage and not keep a dog.", ">A request is not a mistake.\n\nExactly. She could have very well told OP she wouldn\u2019t put them in another room and they could have come up with another plan for a visit.\n\nNTA.", "This made me imagine your girl pup singing that song from The Little Mermaid. I snort-laughed. \ud83d\ude06", "I actually just explained my reasoning. Please feel free to not read me.", "How did your situation enter the discussion? The OP said that he'd only come if the dogs were removed. The sister agreed. Everything after that point shows the  sister to be the AH for lying about the remedy. She could have said no and the visit would not have happened. No one  is saying that the sister had  to remove her dogs, they're  saying that she  should abide by the agreement.", "This isn't about you.", "For your situation that makes sense! But we aren\u2019t talking about your situation, OP\u2019s sister HAS RAMBUNCTIOUS DOGS. I understand you probably have feelings based off of how your friend is treating your dog, but if your dogs aren\u2019t well trained or socialized they can hurt people, even unintentionally. If you want your dog to be free to roam the house its your right as an owner.", "So you say \u201cno\u201d to her request and either meet somewhere else or not at all. She doesn\u2019t like dogs. I\u2019m not actually a big fan of hers\u2026. But she can ask. She\u2019s only wrong in asking if she tells you that you\u2019re disgusting and nasty for having a dog.", "Yeah OP didn't do anything wrong and OP's sister wouldn't have actually been wrong if she didn't lie. There's nothing wrong with requesting the dogs be put up. Sister is also allowed to say no. All OP did is set a boundary that they wouldn't come if the dogs weren't locked up and then they enforced that boundary.", "Like seriously what was stopping her from joining them at the park and shops", "I reckon she would is she could \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Please feel free not to read me and let my words hurt your feelings, cuddles.", "OK. Great chat. Long life to you."]}
