If someone is that adamant about not being around my dogs, then my house is not the place for us to have a visit. I was debating which way to go on this, bc your sister should not have agreed to lock them up and then pull a bait and switch, but I don't have her side of the story, and ultimately, it's on the person who doesn't like dogs to not go to someone's house if they have dogs.", "NTA she lied to you.

It's perfectly normal to ask your sister to move her dogs to a separate room, even if they weren't obnoxious, you have young children and I assume both dogs are well over 40 pounds if they're retrievers, which makes them large animals.

Goldens are always much bigger and stronger than I expected, and although I love their happy attitudes, they can be really needy, in your face dogs.", "It'd be different, if you like came over uninvited and started making demands, but this was something that was agreed to on the phone. She broke her promise.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She lied to you. \n\nAlso, as a dog lover putting them away wasn't a massive request. Dogs have a tendency to get too excited around 'new' people and kids. For my peace of mind and anxiety most of the dogs I've lived with get crated or gated off. The one exception was Esme, an angel of a Shar Pei that we called catdog because she didn't care at all about anything lol.", "NTA.  She should have been upfront with you about her unwillingness to sequester the dogs.  I suppose she thought you\u2019d cave after the long drive.  She has a right to set the rules in her house, sure, but you equally have a right to accept them and enter her residence, or reject them and find something else to do.", "NTA.

They love receiving love, to the point that they get obnoxious. They don\u2019t settle, they run around all crazy and they make all sorts of noise. That\u2019s why they get given their favourite rib bones as a treat and sent to the shop for a couple hours while we have guests. They have beds, water, toys and of course their bones to keep them happy. And then that way no one accidentally gets hurt or annoyed and I\u2019m able to enjoy the company without having to be on edge the entire time! I love my dogs, but separating them from visitors for a little bit isn\u2019t going to hurt them. Your sister could\u2019ve accommodated that without acting like they\u2019re hurting the dogs.", "If dogs jump on a small child it can injure them and cause them to fear dogs forever. NTA.

Long visits? That\u2019s less reasonable. A couple hours is perfectly acceptable.\n\nShe agreed to this ask, but then refused after you drove 2 hours there with 2 small children. She lied to you and thought you\u2019d just give in.", "NTA, you set a clear boundary and it seems like she thought the 2hr drive would \"trap\" you there so she could ignore it freely.\n\nI guess you won't be visiting at her place anymore, now she knows.", "NTA.

I adore my dog. LOVE LOVE LOVE HER. She is not good with children. So when my nephews visit from out-of-state? She gets boarded. When I have her at my mom\u2019s house and the nephews come over? She hangs out in a bedroom with access to food and water and occasional bathroom breaks. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t harm my dog in the slightest and it keeps something bad from happening with the kids. Her instinct is to run when she\u2019s anxious but she could still inadvertently hurt them trying to get away, so we don\u2019t chance it. \n\nThis is a reasonable boundary for you to set. She can also choose not to comply with that boundary, but she gets to deal with the consequences.", "NTA, the first thing I ask anyone coming to our house is if they are OK with big dogs, if not, our great dane can sleep upstairs or hang out in the backyard. She lied about it, and sure, it's her dogs, her house, but you could have met at a park, etc.", "NTA, your sister said she would do one thing and did the opposite. Although I agree that a home is also the dogs/pets, she agreed to put them away in another area of the house before y'all came by. The fact that she didn't keep her end of the bargain is pretty uncool, especially with small children involved. She could've suggested something else, like meeting up at a park or even dropping her dogs off at a doggy daycare/groomer for a few hours so her house would be free of them for y'all to visit. There were so many options, it's a shame she decided to be dishonest and disrespect a boundary that you not only made clear but had a discussion with her about beforehand.", "NTA I think they should get 3 crates - one for each of the dogs, and one for your sister. She's the one whose behavior is out of control.", "NTA", "Idk I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable at ALL to invite someone with tiny kids to your house and expect them to be okay with quite large dogs around the kids. Even the most well intentioned golden retriever dog is bigger than a one year old. I have two labradors they are lovely with children they are gentle sweet and patient with children however today my sister in law is being my three nieces to my house the middle one is four and my dogs are twice the size of her easy, the smallest one is 9 months old. There\u2019s zero chance I\u2019d let my dogs have free range of the house with such little people in it, even the best intentions from a dog can be clumsy or scary for a tiny kid. Also my two have zero inclination of their actual size or weight and literally no spacial awareness so they will reverse and step on a kid or turn round and whip someone with their tails.\n\nSorry I\u2019m all for having dogs meet kids in a controlled environment but everyone has to be on board and big enough to deal with the animal especially when they\u2019re this stupid, and ops children are simply too little. If the sister didn\u2019t want to shut her dogs away she shouldn\u2019t invite tiny children to her home and promise to do the thing she won\u2019t do. She\u2019s unreasonable.", "I agree, NTA. For me it boils down to sister lying and putting the kids in an environment/situation that OP had made clear was unacceptable.\n\nOP, you were not controlling. You made a request, sister agreed to it, sister went back on her word, and you left an environment that did not meet a very specific standard that your sister had agreed to. At this point, sister's lying is what bothers me the most. She tricked you into putting yourself and your family in a situation she knew made you uncomfortable and feel unsafe.", "Yeah, as you can tell, fellow dog owner here. I have put my dogs in a room or crated them as a situation dictates. Sister was a crazy AH.\n\nOP made a request, she agreed, and then she didn't follow up and was outraged when called out for her bad decisions by OP's decision (rightly so in my opinion) to leave.\n\nAlso, when my younger brother was a tot, my grandparents had a 50ish # misbehaving dog that jumped on my younger brother who was sleepy after the long ride, pushed him into a corner and split his head open. So he spent the first hours of the visit in ER getting his head shaved and stitches put in.\n\nGoldens aren't small dogs and they can push around toddlers without trying. OP made a smart choice.", "Exactly. It's not about liking/not liking dogs, it's about lying. If she said she wasn't ok with putting them in a separate room OP could've made an informed decision about whether or not to go round. Sounds like sis thought that if she manipulated the situation OP would realise how amazing her dogs are and change his mind.", "Normally I don't support people who expect pet owners to lock up their pets in their own homes. However, from the sound of it this pet owner has not trained her animals and they are obnoxious and upsetting to guests. If you're going to let your animals run wild then don't lie to people when you say that you will make sure they are not a nuisance. When your animals are a nuisance I don't always think it's pandering for guests to request not to be jumped on, slobbered on, tangled up and tripped when they come for a visit. It sounds like that is what the real problem is here, a lousy, incompetent pet owner who doesn't care what trouble her animals get into.", "I mean OP asked a question and if the sister felt it was such a rude thing, why did she agree to it? He was free to ask and she was free to refuse. Him enquiring about it doesn\u2019t necessarily make him an AH. She refusing also wouldn\u2019t have but her lying and springing this on OP at the last min definitely does", "There is nothing rude about asking someone to put their dogs in another room.", "I agree I only ever see the benefit to securing a pet to a room if it\u2019s for their safety and not for the guests.   As in small kids pulling on dogs ears and tail.  If anything the kids should have been the ones to be worried about. \n\nInstead of agreeing to go to the house they could have met up at a restaurant or a park.  The meetup could have been at OP\u2019s house.  There were ways to avoid being around dogs. \n\nWhile I agree that the Sister lied to OP and that was not ok.  She is right though it\u2019s the dogs home not her niblings.", "Not OP, but my dad bred and raised goldens (he also trained them for bird hunting) when I was kid so I have lots of experience with the breed. They\u2019re my favorite because ours were always submissive and incredibly gentle with kids. Zero aggression.\n\nThat said, they were bred carefully and trained young. They love to jump and wag their tails wildly and I got more than one welt on my leg from being lashed by a (strong) tail accidentally. If young and untrained?

My dad *never* allowed them around little ones until trained. \n\nA golden that lacks manners will also try and snatch your guests\u2019 things (retrieving) like scarfs, shoes, etc. They will drool/lick on your pant leg/shoes.

Good intentions, but very rude and quite possibly painful. \n\nWhen trained (and healthy, I\u2019ve heard of goldens with health issues nipping someone) they are delightful. Unbelievably gentle with even the smallest child. That said, no dog is truly a \u201cnanny dog,\u201d never leave them alone, etc. But our last one, Molly came close, in fact she wouldn\u2019t even harm a squirrel or a rabbit. Zero prey drive.

Oz, may he rest in peace, was a bull mastiff/Rottweiler mix. He was well over 150 pounds. He also allowed all the kids to crawl all over him. My daughter routinely dressed him up as a princess. While huge, he was very chill. He made my daughter cry twice. Once because she stepped on his pe***. And to be fair he just growled at her.

We put her down. Daughter was wayyy more upset about that. Still love dogs and have had more. Isolated situation for sure. But I\u2019m always careful around dogs and little really one ones. I will say I\u2019m actually more comfortable with the big ones and kids than the little yappers.", "I'm jealous of DD, I started out at 4\u00bdlbs, think I weighed 28 lbs in kindergarten and I would have LOVED to have a dog that I could ride (the toy Chihuahua  wasn't  wasn't quite the same)\ud83e\udd74", "We have a Rottie/Mastiff mix and he is the sweetest, most gentle pup ever rescued. The only way he'd hurt anyone would be to step on their toes but he's usually very careful where he puts his paws. Kids can paint his nails and dress him up and he sits there patiently and lets them do what they want. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body.", "Yeah like my dog when I was born was a Doberman, I have several pictures of him in my dress up clothes when I was a toddler. The difference between our dogs and ops sister seems to be training and us being very aware of our dogs behaviour temperament and mood", "You're missing the point - she lied", "My sister in law ran a daycare and had 2 mastiffs. They were so gentile parents didn't mind them around the kids. And she never left them alone with the kids. But those dogs adored them.\nShe has had a few more since then. She loves the breed and has always got giant protective cuddle bugs.", "> My stance is more toward let the dogs be and make the kids learn to give the dogs room, 4/5 time if a kid gets bit, it's because the kid was being a little shit.\n\nHaha, fuck you, never have kids. When I was four and playing in the backyard, a neighbor's dog had got loose and came running over. It knocked me down and tore off my cheek, did enough damage that to properly sew up the wound, they had to cut out some muscle. But oh yeah, I was a little shit for simply being on my family's property while the neighbor had a dog.", "but the sister agreed to putting the dogs in a different room for the visit, then reneged on it, THAT is the AH move. If she had just said \"no, this is the dogs house too I don't agree to that, so lets meet elsewhere.\" THAT would be totally acceptable.", "They literally did fuck off and sister just got mad at them for that, too.", "That\u2019s absolutely disgusting. No offense, but they shouldn\u2019t be pet owners.", "Oi. Sorry to hear about all of that. I can see why you decided to rant here. The dogs would probably do better if they went outside and walked. They would have some mental stimulation and an outlet for their energy. Jacks are high energy dogs. I have two chihuahuas that are (disposable)pee pad trained\u2026 but they also get let outside and go on walks.. dogs prefer going outside. But I\u2019m sure you know, your sister is doing those dogs a disservice by letting them run the house and by letting them be so overprotective of their people. Jeez.", "The sister said the dogs would be locked away. She is fully responsible for this situation. We aren\u2019t talking about dog bites here. You think that is the only way a dog could hurt a child? They are rambunctious and poorly trained animals that probably weigh about 70 pounds each. They could trip a child,step on a child ,or knock a child over and injure them. They could also hurt a child by whacking them with their tails or scratching them. \n\nBrother set a reasonable boundary to protect his kids. Sister intentionally misled him. Brother held his boundary. The only disrespectful and ridiculous person here is the sister. She thought she could manipulate him by playing games. Brother refused to play the games. He is in no way a bad guy. Of course his children\u2019s safety is going to be more important to him than letting his lying manipulative sister get her way.\n\n\nHe is not denying anybody a close relationship with their aunt. She could easily get herself out of her house to come see them at a neutral location if she really cared about them that much. But, she cares about her petty mind games more than her brother or her niblings.", "That\u2019s so cute \ud83d\ude02", "Agreed with the last sentence. I'm a veterinarian, and I tried as hard as I could to talk my brother out of getting a chihuahua for his kids. My nephews are 2, 6 and 8, all full of energy, loud, and intense. Chihuahuas are not always aggressive, but a nervous breed nonetheless. I don't think it would be the best dog for them. \nDuring my whole career, I have never been bitten by a Pitbull, Doberman, Mastiff, Rottweiller, etc. But I've been bitten several times by chihuahuas, shih tzus and poodles, although the bites are much less dangerous from them", "I agree with you. Big dogs can be docile.. but I wouldn\u2019t trust any dog around an unfamiliar kid. And we are supposed to protect our children\u2026 not put them in a position to potentially get bit by a large dog so they will learn. Wtf? And we should protect our dogs from having to be put down due to biting a kid. Gosh. To the person you replied to, username checks out unfortunately. What an awful take.", "Nobody cares about ur dog lol", "All of the things you listed can be avoided by keeping an eye on the kids and the dogs. You don\u2019t have to lock them away. Millions of households every year live full time with little kids and dogs very peacefully and lovingly. A 1 yr old learning to walk falls constantly. If they happened to trip near the dog that is far from the end of the world. A tail whap would certainly not seriously harm a kid lol like be serious. Again, you should not stop kids from running, playing and experiencing life because of a small risk of them getting hurt. And make no mistake that risk is very small. Even if the kid falls and scrapes it\u2019s knee that is bound to happen in life and not the end of the world. And not a reason to avoid someone\u2019s house forever.", "I had a Chihuahua who wasn\u2019t the least bit nervous, but he was a small dog.  My hesitation with having small kids around him would be that they\u2019d hurt him unknowingly.  Not a good breed for small kids.", "Small dogs are just so terrible with kids for so many reasons. They're so easy for the kids to hurt accidentally causing the dog to lash out at them whereas a newfoundland is not even gonna notice if a 2 year old falls on him"]}
