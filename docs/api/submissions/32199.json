While it\u2019s totally reasonable of her to not put her dogs away, she lured you and your family to her home under the condition that she would. My assumption is that she thought you would cave.

You communicated that if you were to come over with your small children, she would have to put her dogs in another area of the home, and she agreed to it. I think it\u2019s unreasonable for her to disrespect a clear boundary after agreeing to it. Then, being mad that you\u2019re upset and won\u2019t come in. Although I understand it\u2019s her dogs' home too, she should have had a larger conversation with you about it if she wasn\u2019t truly comfortable, instead of agreeing and thinking you\u2019d be okay with her changing her mind.", "NTA\n\nShe lied to you. More than that, she refused to put her dogs away from where you would be, when they clearly are a bother to you. Dog owners have a responsibility to NOT foist their animals on others who are uncomfortable with the animals. It would be different if you hadnt asked her to and she agreed to, put them away. But because she lied, you were not the Ahole for leaving.", "NTA. You don\u2019t like the dogs, asked her to put them away and she agreed. She lied, so you left. Idk why she\u2019s mad, what else did she expect you to do?", "NTA its really not difficult to put the dogs some where else for an hour. Shes terrible for lying about being willing to do so.", "NTA it was communicated that the dogs would be put away and you had your toddlers who the dogs don\u2019t know it was for safety more than anything", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell done.", "My home was where my dog lived. And he was never a guest here. (I do not ask peopel to sequester their children in other rooms when I visit. So, I would not ask someone to put their dog away so I can enjoy their home.) That's rude AH, IMO. So, I truly understand your sister's point. \n\nShe should not have misled you or wasted your time, though. And for future reference, if you don't want to be around her dogs, just don't go over to her house. ***Her dogs aren't guests there. You are.***\n\nESH. Your expectations are unreasonable. And she lied and said she'd put the dogs up when she never intended to.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you asked her to euthanize them.
