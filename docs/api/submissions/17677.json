For what it's worth, I have ADHD and had the same habit with hobbies like this when I was in my late teens. And you're probably right she does have it. If someone came to me with your exact concern, my response would be \"fuck you I've been trying to find the right hobby and **this** one is it.\" \n\nIt would come to pass that they would have been right, mind you. I just wasn't aware of how ADHD impacts my life at that age. \n\nThe only way I wouldn't react negatively would have been if someone was like \"hey, I'm so excited to see if you like it, but don't you think you should get this $150 guitar or rent a guitar until you get to the point to play a few songs and have a better idea of what kind of guitar you will need?\" \n\nSo...maybe try that. You have to pass your concern along with a positive message if you want it to be well received\"", "[deleted]", "NTA as partners you'll eventually share some part of your finances anyway.

If an SO, friend, or loved one is doing something you think is silly, and they come to you to talk about it, you definitely should speak up.  If they don\u2019t come to you about it, then you probably shouldn\u2019t mention it.\n\nLike if OP ended the post asking \u201cshould I get out of this relationship?\u201d, I\u2019d say \u201cHell yeah!\u201d  But he didn\u2019t ask, so I\u2019ll keep that to myself.", "Impulsive with her money? Check\n\nDives head first into a hobby she feels passionate about, only to quickly lose interest a short while later? Check.\n\nSeeking the immediate acquisition of a guitar and can't wait to think about it cause that is like way less of a dopamine hit? Check. \n\nThese are indeed ADHD traits (though there are many more symptoms needed for a diagnosis, particularly related to focusing), you make a good case.\n\nNAH\nYou have seen her cycle through many hobbies, so you are right to be cautious here. It's very likely she will move on. Its also really silly to buy an electric guitar and amp before you even know how to play. Particularly when somebody offered you one to learn on first!  You are NTA. If she does have ADHD, people like you can help keep her grounded (to her annoyance, but it can help).\n\nHOWEVER, she is also correct that it's her money, and she can spend it how she wants to. If she wants to deep dive into learning guitar and wants to buy a $600 guitar to do it, well, it's not your place to stop her. Even if it's clearly a dumb idea.", "Soft NTA.\n\nYou're doing your best to be concerned for somebody you care about, and musical instruments are a wide field. Why, when I was your age and was interested in archery, I was lent both a 35lbs and 50lbs draw longbows and that massively helped me decide on what kind of bow I wanted.\n\nYou might try a bit more finesse. Is there is a music store around where you can test out their lower-end guitars in the store? That way she's trying out potential guitars that could belong to her, and you'd be able to do it together.", "NAH - you\u2019re trying to be supportive by offering to loan her guitars while helping her save money.  Some day mommy and daddy are going to stop throwing money at her and getting her to slow down now can help set healthy spending habits in the future.", "NTA for pointing out her habit, however, she is right, it is her money, to do with as she pleases.", "NAH.

But since its not your money, it shouldn't be any of your concern, then again its also her parents money so, yikes to the parents", "NAH, but I might be biased as I am that person - guitar, saxophone, the great American novel, painting, miniature wargames, wood working, etc.", "NTA for not taking it seriously but it's also none of your business. \n\nShe's 17 and it's not your money. Be enthusiastic for her and a happy supportive boyfriend. She's not hurting anyone and starting new hobbies clearly brings her joy.", "NTA. Based on how you described it, you weren't criticizing, you were offering a cheaper option that leads to the same goal. As long as you weren't being an asshole in that conversation, I don't think what you did was wrong. \n\nAlso, you're both young and that is kind of the age where you try out a bunch of stuff and that's a good thing. Most people don't pour tons of money into it however, but some do. Does she ever sell any of her old hobby stuff?", "You can\u2019t control how she spends her money but I think your heart is in the right place to try and save her money. I also want to ask where this money is coming from if she has enough to splurge on hundreds of dollars every time she finds a new hobby? \n(I apologize for grammar new phone)", "NTA. She's technically still a child and seems like she doesn't understand money at all because mummy and daddy didn't teach her. In my opinion, she needs to know how money works because the spending and fixation on something temporarily gives her a dopamine fix (ADHD for sure) and so while I get where you're coming from you just need to let her run her course. She's not going to care about the spending until it fucks her around eventually. The best thing to do is smile and nod your head honestly.", "NTA, while it is not your money and picking up hobbies is absolutely her choice, suggesting solid spending habits or offering your guitar to try first is not a bad idea if you intend this to be a lasting relationship. \n\nHaving disparate financial frames of mind can be a tremendous stressor upon a long term relationship, and a lot of people grow up without frivolous spending becoming a problem until it is and have no idea what to do in hard times that they build for themselves. \n\nYou guys are young, its her parents money, and its her choice. But a relationship is a mutual choice and you should be aware of what you want from it and try to set yourself up on solid financial grounds. \n\nBest of luck and I think that you are very aware for your age!", "NTA\n\n\nYou even offered to lend her a guitar! I am 47 years old and have been playing guitar for a long time. This year I purchased a guitar that cost $700. My previous guitars were more like $300. Six hundred dollars for a first guitar is way too much money. These days you can get some pretty awesome instruments for $200-$300.", "I don't think you're the asshole for being concerned, but YTA for making speculative diagnoses , and YTA for telling someone what to do with their money.

Really, it\u2019s none of your business", "YTA bc it is none of your business what she does with her money. AND it's completely ok to pick up different hobbies and drop them, maybe picking them up again years later (I say this as someone with a ton of yarn under the bed and I haven't knit in years-- I know I will again some day).

There are ways you can broach this subject tactfully and still support your girlfriend. \n\nAlso I have hobbies that I drop for a year or more and then come back to it. I have specific ones that come back around fairly regularly so it\u2019s possible your GF won\u2019t drop something forever and having the stuff for it available isn\u2019t a terrible idea.

And it's really good and nice that she has the ability and will to try out at everything, but in my opinion, she/her parents are all irresponsible. They know her, she knows herself.

THEY should be the ones to have enough common sense to suggest things like renting out the equipment first or borrowing it first, etc.", "Meh, a partner making a suggestion like that isn\u2019t the same thing as telling someone how to spend their money in my opinion.
