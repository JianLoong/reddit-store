{"id": 16517, "submission_id": "139bseb", "title": "AITA for going over board in response to my aunt uninviting my brother from her wedding?", "selftext": "Me and my aunt are(were) real close. We\u2019re both only 3 years apart so we grew up like sisters rather than aunt and niece but for clarity, I\u2019ll refer to her as my aunt. \n\nShe\u2019s getting married to her fianc\u00e9 in the next month and while I\u2019m not maid of honor, I\u2019m still playing a huge part in her wedding. \n\nNow, I have a little brother, he\u2019s about 18. He\u2019s genuinely a good kid but he\u2019s had a hard life. Was diagnosed with bipolar recently too. \n\nThe family isn\u2019t too open minded when it comes to things like mental illness so my mom did get some calls from some \u201cconcerned\u201d family members when grandma told everyone. My mom told off all the rude ones and once people realized my brother is still my brother and not some false stereotype they had created, most went back to normal. \n\nMy aunt never said anything bad about him. She always expressed her sympathies and even snapped at one of my cousins for making a joke about his diagnosis.\n\nBut my brother wasn\u2019t feeling too good the other night and eventually told me that while he was formally invited to the wedding, aunt told him she was just trying to be polite and hopes he\u2019ll make up an excuse for not attending because she\u2019s uncomfortable with his \u201chistory.\u201d It had been eating him up and he felt really betrayed because she was one of few people that still treated him the same. \n\nI was pissed off. Aunt and I are close as sisters, but that\u2019s my little brother. I went to her house immediately and confronted her. First she accused him of lying, said some really gross shit. When she realized that I wasn\u2019t falling for that, she told me she just wanted her day to go perfect and he\u2019s a ticking time bomb just waiting to explode. \n\nI left without saying a word, got my dress for her wedding, the cue cards with my speech in it, and even her wedding gifts that I had gotten and just took them all down to her house and told her that I\u2019m not going to her lame ass wedding. \n\nShe begged me to reconsider, that I\u2019m her best friend blah blah blah. I admit, I called her a bitch and told her that I don\u2019t wanna see her pathetic ass again.  She cried and I left. After all that she said about my brother, I just couldn\u2019t. She texted later saying I did too much and that everyone\u2019s uncomfortable around my brother and that we\u2019re the problems. Her mom called me later saying that my brother and I got all the bad genes, and she\u2019s glad we won\u2019t be at the wedding. \n\nThey\u2019re also texting my mom telling her that I need to get checked too and my mom thinks I should apologize just to make everyone shut up. She also says that I do have a tendency to go overboard and overreact. I can admit to that, but I\u2019m highly protective of my brother. It\u2019s just when it comes to him. Still, be honest.\n\nEdit:\n\nMy brother had a bad panic attack once two years ago at a Christmas dinner which got as bad as it did because everyone in the family crowded around him because they\u2019re nosy. He knocked some things over and caused a scene but he did not behave destructively or aggressively like someone in the comments is implying. He was panicked. His mental health has improved greatly since then and not even the disgusting reaction to his diagnosis has affected his mental health. That\u2019s how much healthier he\u2019s gotten. \n\nHe\u2019s been to many dinners, get together and parties, formal as well as ones with just his friends in the past two years. Yes he has bad days, but he also has coping methods and it would be VERY VERY VERY unlikely for him to have a panic attack on her wedding day. Still, if she did not want to \u201crisk it\u201d there was no need for her to manipulate my brother then insult him. She could\u2019ve talked to me.

She tried to lie to you, she\u2019s obviously ashamed. \n\n2. She tried to call you bipolar and that seems to me like gaslighting. There is a big difference between being upset about something THAT IS UPSETTING and having a mental illness. \n\n4. She\u2019s triangulating by saying \u201ceveryone else in the family\u201d feels this way. \n\n5. She\u2019s sending flying monkeys by getting her mom to call you. \n\nAll of these things are signs of narcissism (and I really don\u2019t throw that term around lightly like others do on the internet.) You\u2019re honestly better off cutting her off completely. She sounds toxic at least, if not narcissistic. People become bridzillas and normally I would say it\u2019s her wedding, but this isn\u2019t reasonable, especially coupled with how she handled it with you.", "NTA. \n\nGotta love people who excuse their own shitty behavior, but who call out anyone else's justified emotions as mental illness. She's a real piece of work.", "NTA\n\nAs someone that has dealt with a family that has a \"hands off\" \"hush hush\" \"you are mentally deficient\" etc., approach to mental illness this strikes home hard. Be there for your brother. I've spent nearly a decade trying to \"repair\" supposed \"burned bridges\" with my family after a suicide attempt due to past sexual trauma and diagnosed bipolar disorder. I was basically told to be put on five different medications to \"fix me\" and it only made things worse. The stigma surrounding mental illness is deplorable to me. After reading your updated comments with questions concerning your brother's behavior it is ludicrous to me that they are still holding him accountable for what to me would be a reasonable (yet perhaps a bit overwhelming at the time) panic attack at a Christmas party (2 years ago!) \n\nYour Aunt, albeit nice, seems like she should have understood BOTH of you better yet  hurtfully yielded to traditional familial mental wellness stigma.\n\nYour brother is going to need you; bipolar is actually a disorder that is more prevalent than one would think; the stigma exists because people are afraid to face the fact that mood imbalances are actually quite normal. Some vacillate. It's human and not something to be ashamed about with proper therapy/clinical guidance. The more support you give him, the less he will feel isolated from the rest of the family and the less likely he will allow his emotions/behavior to tailspin. Support systems are key. \n\nIn my opinion, I don't care if you yelled at your Aunt and went off the handle a bit. I don't care if it's her wedding. The \"bad genes\" comment alone from her mother sums it all up for me. I would have done the same for my brother to \"shatter\" the illusion of \"safety\" and overbearing stigma families too commonly have against common forms of mental illness. \n\nAgain, I repeat, NTA.", "Info: has your brother done anything wrong or behaved inappropriately in anyway?

I'm rarely sympathetic when people go out of their way to make a scene & pick a fight, but in this case--hoo boy, the aunt deserved all of it and more. \n\nExtending a public invite & then secretly pulling your bro aside to whisper poison is just... vile. The worst sort of hypocrisy. Then acting as though your absolutely justified, righteous anger is somehow a symptom of a mental disorder that she \\*knows\\* your whole family stigmatizes? \n\nI usually think it's better to be pragmatic about these things; we only get a few families in our lives and they're too precious to waste. There's always a rotten apple or two. But man. I cannot recommend making peace if your aunt isn't able to understand what she's done wrong & truly make amends.", "NTA sounds like you are doing the heavy lifting in your family breaking bad generational cycles/stigma.

Well done for sticking up for your brother and the family sounds like they have been unkind to you for this as well.", "NTA", "NTA. \nBeing diagnosed with something like that is awful. Not because of what it is, because of the way people treat people with bipolar disorder. It's a slow slow battle to cultural acceptance for conditions like this, and people like your aunt are NOT helping. You didn't go over board. You are the reasonable one. Your brother didn't deserve ANY of that treatment. Frankly, the fact your aunt did something like that is just awful.", "NTA and good for you, defending your brother.\n\nHe must be stoked that you have his back.\n\nThe aunt is wrong. The aunt's mother is nasty. The rest of the flying monkeys can go find another forest to perch in.", "ESH. You charged over there heated and looking to fight. You should have cooled off before talking to her. And she should have given you a heads up this was happening.", "I\u2019m going with YTA.  It\u2019s her wedding. She\u2019s not obligated to invite anyone.  Second, you don\u2019t have the right to call her names. Most importantly, you\u2019re leaving out a lot of stuff.  For instance, why did she call your brother a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d?", "ESH except your brother, but you only a little bit because of your reaction. Everyone else are the major AH's here. Fine it's her wedding and she can invite/not invite whomever they want, but inviting your brother \"out of obligation\" then privately telling him to make up some excuse that he can't be there to not ruin her \"perfect\" day is inappropriate. She should have invited him and accepted anything that might have happened or not invited him at all. She might have had to uncomfortably explained why she didn't invite him, but her awkward explanation probably could have been accepted and glossed over by most of the family. Since it sounds like much of the rest of the family is now aware of you dropping out and what went down when you did, I'd send a mass message to the family. Something along the lines of \"Since everyone now knows that \\[x event\\] happened, I will say that I have dropped out of the wedding because I don't want to participate in something for a person who has insulted my brother and then almost immediately thereafter myself. I also don't want to be around the woman (hi grandma!) that indicated that brother and I got the \"bad genes\", oh and grandma...those genes had to have come from somewhere in your line, which means you have them too! The only apology I give is for the language I used when I told \\[bride\\] that I was no longer going to be part of the wedding. I acknowledge I should not have insulted her using cuss words. And to \\[bride\\], there is no historical account of a wedding and it's day being \"perfect\", there has always been *something* that has gone wrong albeit minor and easily fixed thus forgotten about.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
