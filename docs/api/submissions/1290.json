The work isnt really hard (i work for the security at a unversity which mostly means i sit at the information desk, and a saturday shifts are even easier since next to nobody is gonna be here). But there is nobody else that could take his shift so i just said yes.  \n\nIm the one that was supposed to drive us there (my sister has no license) which means they also cant go. I told my sister this and as expected she was pissed. She told me that i cant stand my ground and that i needed to say no and that i was being used. I already felt guilty for being the reason why we cant go so it escalated into a fight.\n\nI told her that she was only pissed because her plans were canceled too not  because she felt for me, because if she was really worried about me she wouldnt make this harder on me than it already is. I am someone that feels guilty easily when i cant do something that my loved ones ask of me and she knows that.
