I want nothing to do with her, she is disgusting to me and I can\u2019t stand the thought of even seeing her in person.\n\nA little backstory\u2026\n\nMy dad asked my mom for a divorce in January. They were married for 20 years. \n\nAbout 12 years into their marriage, my dad had an affair with one of his coworkers. She knew my dad was married and was in a marriage herself!(Her husband later divorced her after finding out about that) Not only did they have sex multiple times, but my dad brought her into our house and did it in the basement. This lady told my dad he should divorce my mother (despite them both being married). Eventually my mom found out and they opted to keep the marriage and try to work through it.\n\nIt is now September (the divorce was actually finalized and went through in the first week of September)\n\nHere we are 8 years later and my dad is now dating the same homewrecker. Mind you: he started dating her months before the divorce was even final.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t even been a year since my parents split up. The divorce has done some serious damage on me and my family. If my dad wants to date, then great. But at what cost? We are all still trying to heal from the damage he did by leaving. Not only that but he is constantly trying to invite his disgusting girlfriend to everything and getting me to meet her. \n\nPersonally, it\u2019s WAY too soon for me to even want to know about him dating. If he\u2019s happy then great. But of all people, why her? \nDoes he not understand the damage he has done to my mom already? And how much worse he is making it by going back to the same lady he cheated on my mom with?\nI have made it more than clear I have no interest in knowing this lady at all. I don\u2019t want to know her name, I don\u2019t want to meet her, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want her trying to shove her way into our lives already.\n\nI had a boyfriend once who was so severely addicted to pornography he made me feel like absolute shit about my body and like I wasn\u2019t enough. I hated myself and cried over it almost daily. Constantly wondered why he kept choosing naked girls online, over me. \n\nSo to see my mother in so much pain and have to wonder why she isn\u2019t good enough or wonder why her body wasn\u2019t enough for my dad because of this woman, INFURIATES me. I can\u2019t even imagine the amount of insecurity and suffering she is going through because of this. \n\nAnd now my dad wants us to meet his shit for a new girlfriend after I have repeatedly told him no and that I am not ready yet.\n\nMy dad tells me that I am selfish and I should not judge her for her mistakes. He says I have to meet her at some point and that we would all get along great.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: thanks so much to everyone recommending things like therapy and how important it is to let go of anger etc. I\u2019ve actually been seeing a therapist for awhile because of my horrific body image issues and more recently because of my parents. \nHolding onto the anger is extremely damaging and I\u2019ll work on that\u2026. With time. \nI am just as much upset at my dad as well as his girlfriend because although he was a great dad- he was an awful husband for my mom. They are both to blame.", "created_utc": 1694498212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gj6qb/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_want_nothing_to_do_with/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t need to meet his ruthless partner in crime.\n\nThey might both be happy within their home wrecking lifestyle but to keep you out of it.\n\nYour mom deserved better than that. You deserved better than that.\n\nThey deserve the consequences to their cheating ways.", "tell him you aren't judging her, your judging him and he has no ground to stand on to tell anybody they're being selfish after his behavior.

Introduce her to family and friends \"she's X, the woman who destroyed our family\" \"You have my blessing, enjoy it while it lasts, you never know when she'll find another married dude\", \"Me selfish? I guess I got that from you since you wiped your ass with your family\". Make her not want to be around you. Always call her by her name, make her understand that everything she does, your mom always did better.", "NTA.\n\nI went through a similar experience when my parents divorced and dad gleefully jumped into a new relationship with his affair partner.\n\nDecades have passed and he still doesn't understand why I don't like her or want anything to do with her.\n\nHe is being dismissive of your very legitimate feelings.  You are an adult and are not required to have a meaningful relationship with your father if he doesn't respect your feelings.", "NTA. A small bit of wisdom and advice before I say anything else; being a homewrecker generally isn't a thing someone does it's a lifestyle and an addiction. That being said your dad is also a homewrecker keep your guard up around these two. What was done was not only a betrayal to your mother but a betrayal to you and the rest of your family. Also just because you can eventually forgive someone about something doesn't mean you have to forget and become naive to what they're capable of doing to the people they claim to love.", "Fuck her !!! Your dad is an a-hole not you. You are 18 you can decide for yourself kiddo. You have no relation with his gf. \n\nI have a huge respect for your mom for keeping the marriage even after she found out that her husband had been cheating on her.", "NTA, you're 18 and are not legally required to be around her. Just remember your father is just as much at fault as she is, although I can see how you may be more forgiving of him given that he's your dad. This affair has caused emotional trauma, and it's never fun to see your mother betrayed this way. Shame on them.", "NTA and your father should stop trying to force her company on you. But honestly; you should be just as mad at your father, or even more so, than at this random woman. They both chose to have the affair and both deserve equal ire.

Your whole vibe screams home wrecker.\u201d And walk away.", "NTA. The best you can do for yourself and your family is to be honest with yourself about how you feel and to respect those feelings. \n\nYour dad is not respecting your feelings. Ignore him.  Meeting his AP will do nothing for you and a lot to you. There is no advantage for you in having this person in your life.", "NTA - the gf did not make a \u2018mistake\u2019 she made a CHOICE.  \nI am so tired of people who are cheaters saying they make a mistake.  \nTell your Dad if he keeps pushing it you will not see him either.", "NTA\n\nThey don't get to dictate what you do as an adult (and even as a child but you have less choices if you are really young).\n\nIt sounds like you have a fair bit of trauma over this whole big mess with your parents.\n\nYour dad was TA 8 years ago when he cheated with his co-worker.  If he and your mother were having issues they could've seen someone to help them through it, or come to the realisation that they aren't meant to be together.. and then your dad would've been free to pursue his co-worker, or he will have realised that your mother was the woman for he.\n\nYour mother obviously really want the relationship to work but the writing was probably on the wall for a long time.  Once cheating happens, trust is gone and it's very difficult to have that full trust again (there are people that seem to get through this but it's always in the back of their mind.. even if it's subconcious, or they have their cheating partner on a very short leash).  In hindsight it may have been better if this was a deal breaker 8 years ago but you can't blame her for trying.  And I also wouldn't be too surprised if there was a bit of, 'but think of the kids, you have to stay,' sort of stuff going on and now that you are an adult they have split up (are you the youngest).\n\nThe co-worker did the wrong thing by agreeing to a relationship with a married man.  She could've said no, if it was your dad driving this... or not started it at all if it was her driving it.\n\nThey are perhaps soul mates but it doesn't mean that you need to forgive and forget.  It's caused a lot of damage to quite a few people.  He is the selfish one... not you.  He doesn't want to be held accountable for his atrocious actions.", "No, you don't \"have\" to do anything. You made yourself clear, he chooses not to listen. Write him an email (so you have a copy for yourself) and spell it out for him. He was thinking only of himself and now it's come around and bit him on the ass. Anything he says from that point on should be taken with a grain of salt. He got what he wanted so let him live it. Don't let him guilt you either because he will try and if he says something along the lines of that is not how I raised you, tell him correct, those values you learned from your mother. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI was in a similar situation myself, my mum left my dad for someone she had cheated with years previously after they bumped into each other again at her new place of work.\n\nI don't blame you for being resentful, an your dad having the gall to tell **YOU** you're being the selfish one? mans a grade A tossbag.\n\nYou're better off rid of him OP and i don't blame you for taking the stance you are.\n\nAnd No you Don't \"have to meet her eventually\" you're 18 and well within your rights to cut his ass off.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid I wouldn\u2019t want to meet someone who flipped my life upside down nor would I associate with someone who was also apart of that.", "NTA of course you don't want to meet the woman that helped break your family", "No, is no plain and simple. You don't have to do nothing you don't want to do tell him he made his bed. He should lie in it. It is not up to you to make buddy buddy with his side piece if you don't like it, don't talk to him. Obviously he wasn't that great of a father to ruin his family and force his affair partner on you and gaslight you", "\"All that anger is gonna burn you up kid.\"\n\n\"Na.. it keeps me warm.\" \n(Red Dawn 1980's)\n\nNTA and no, you don't have to associate with this woman. If anything you shouldn't be mad at her as much as angry with your father. Drop him and support your mother, block him if you have to. The biggest thing you need is space and therapy to navigate this massive betrayal. \n\nI'm so sorry this happened, don't let anyone tell you that you *have* to have contact with your father. I've come from divorced parents with a very selfish narcissist father that I regularly have to deflect his contact. I still encounter him at meet ups my siblings host, but that's their guest not mine. You have a say in who you can handle seeing or talking to.", "We constantly judge people by their mistakes. So why not her?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do anything.\n\nNTA", "NTA I wouldn't want to meet this witch either. I'd probably even go low contact or no contact with my father if this happened. I'm mad for you in this situation.", "NTA - your feelings of resentment are 100% valid. \n\nMy only advice would be - hate takes it toll on you. The wounds are fresh now, and I do not judge you for keeping your distance and your strong feelings. At some point, tho, you will need to let it all go for your sake so you can live a positive life. Time (and maybe therapy if available) is what it will take, unfortunately.", "NTA. And you are not selfish, your dad and his train wreck girlfriend are.", "Absolutely NTA. If your dad wants to play \u201chappy family\u201d with his affair partner, he can do it without you.", "You cannot really know what went on in your parents\u2019 relationship or your father\u2019s heart. It seems so easy to say, they are horrible people, and maybe they are. But to me it sounds like he fell in love with this woman and could not get over her, though he tried for his family\u2019s sake. Maybe it had been better to divorce 8 years ago. \nThat said, he has absolutely no right to try to force you to meet her. \nSo I will say NTA.", "OK so I know your edit mentioned letting go of anger and all, but petty me votes that if you have to/he keeps pushing you to meet the gf, she only gets referred to as homewrecker. You let your dad know that, that you'll say it to her face, and you'll do it publicly too. He'll obviously be mad but he might cave eventually. Even if he doesn't, she probably will\n\nIf you ever do let go of the anger and want to meet her, it should be on your terms, not theirs, cause they are the homewreckers", "If or when you meet her for the first time, here are some good conversation starters:\n\n1. Was my dad the only married man you had an affair with or were there others?\n2. Why would you date a man that would cheat on his wife?\n3. Have you slept with every man in town and are making your way down the list for the second time?\n4. Do you consider yourself a good role model for young women?\n\nIf your dad says anything rude to you, just mutter that you hope mom remarries so you will have a good man in your life that can walk you down the aisle some day.\n\nNTA", "HER mistake? This is about HIS mistake. NTA. He's your father and you love him, so you can continue to have a relationship with him past his shitty behaviour. But none of that is true with her. It's fair to tell him that despite history, you're willing to have a relationship with him one-on-one, but have no interest in meeting or having any kind of civil relationship with her.\n\n\\~\\~\n\nBut consider this, for a moment. I'm now 58. When I was 47, I tracked down my birth mother (I'm an adoptee). We hit it off right away; we were finishing each other's sentences on day one, and I have never met anyone who thinks more like me. A decade later and we're still close. After giving me up, she married a man and adopted two kids, and then carried another to term, ten years after I was born. Years later, she left him. He was a good man, and her kids had and have no idea why she did so. She never had a bad word to say about him to the kids, as was proper. Good people don't shit-talk their kid's other parent.\n\nBut she told me; we met as adults, and consequently some things that are normally off limits for parent/child conversation were easy to discuss. I can't say her reason for divorcing was stellar, but she's a high libido person, and was in a dead-bed marriage with an older man. So when her kids were older, she divorced him.\n\nNone of this has any bearing on you, but consider this: no child has complete insight into their parents' marriage. There might be facts that you don't know - that you'll never know, and wouldn't want to if you did - that make his actions less heinous.", "YTA You talk about your father \u201cdating\u201d but it sounds like he loves this woman and has a deep connection with her. Not excusing the affair - just pointing out that people don\u2019t have an 8/9 year relationship with someone whom they don\u2019t love. Some people\u2019s marriages last for less time.\n\nAlso there could very well be NOTHING wrong with your mother. People don\u2019t necessarily break up because there is something wrong with a person. They break up because they have outgrown the relationship or they prefer someone else or they feel unfulfilled etc. It\u2019s very immature to assign blame to someone who is dumped.\n\nIf your father did break up with your mum because there was something wrong with her, then it would have been about her behaviour. If he couldn\u2019t handle her behaviour, then she was not the right person for him.", "NTA, but maybe your dad was unhappy being with your mom.  It doesn't sound like this woman was just a lay for him. He actually cares about her.  Yes it's fucked up what happened, but it isn't between you and him.  It's between your parents.  If he had divorced her and then started dating, would you feel differently?", "My girlfriend dressed up as a policewoman and told me I was under arrest on suspicion of being good in bed.
