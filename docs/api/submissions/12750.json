For me, it was a bit na\u00efve to think they would just bond because they are teens. \n\nI had boys (grown now) and there were a few times they told me they hated me. I knew we were doing out job.\n\nMy suggestion is to find some outside counseling for everyone.

Your daughter clearly needs to get her points straight (if this makes any sense). Indeed what she did was extremely cruel and as much as she dresses \"within the norm of cool\", things can flip and what's cool can soon be deemed \"hideous\" a she puts it. It's sad that sometimes we thing we raise kids to be kind and empathethic and something like this happens and makes you wonder where in the hell they got it from (I don't have any kids but I'd be devastated by it). Hopefully she can learn from her mistake.\n\nAlso, good you stood by your stepdaughter! She clearly needed the support. It might take time but hopefully they can get along fine (maybe not besties, but at least not like this).", "NTA. \n\nDo I think Jessica needs consequences? Yes. Do I think taking away clothes and makeup will make her see the error of her ways?

Based on X situation and the way you are currently speaking to me, you seem to have forgotten this.\u201d And \u201cSad choices have sad consequences.\u201d \n\nA favorite consequence in my family is being grounded from something until some kind of assigned reading is done.

You did a great job supporting your stepdaughter. I think the biggest issue here is that Jessica feels pressured by her friends into acting a certain way. She isn't able to stand up to them and defend someone who doesn't dress like the group likes. Peer pressure is going to make her do things down the road she may not want to do but feels like she has to in order to be accepted.

Taking makeup/clothing from a 15 year old, especially one for whom it's a career interest *feels* wrong to me(?) But if I look at it logically... \n\nI think it sounds like Jessica is placing a level of importance on makeup/fashion which is a bit extreme at her age. Like with anything else, if you can't use it responsibly, you shouldn't be using it. And the consequence is at least moderately related to the behavior (taking the clothing, at least... idk about the makeup).\n\nSo I'm trying to think about why it feels wrong, to me. And I'm thinking back to when I was that age, and I had... lots of sisters and stepsisters lol\n\nI can imagine *Jessica* seeing this as... \"Mom's trying to kiss up to stepdad by defending steptroll and forcing me to be as hideous as she is\". Because, yknow... teens are self-absorbed AHs sometimes and don't learn what we want them to learn. This could actually lead to... like there will probably be a short period where she's nice to Bella to get her stuff back, but long term... treating Bella even worse.\n\nAnd, conversely this bothers me a bit:\n\n> other than her skincare prescribed by her dermatologist\n\nI think it might be possible that Jessica is... overcompensating? Is she self-conscious due to a skin condition? Taking makeup away in that case could amplify any body image/insecurity issues. This is also supported by the comment that she started teasing Bella because her friends were making fun of her for living with her.\n\nIt is an fashion-related consequence for fashion-related bullying, so I don't necessarily think it's an inappropriate consequence.\n\nAnd I think you handled the conversation with Bella beautifully, and addressed Jessica with the right *level* of severity.\n\nIt's just...  not even the clothing. I think the clothing/phone consequences are spot on... it's just that if I was the parent implementing these consequences with my teen... I'd be really uncomfortable with taking her makeup. Something just feels off about it.\n\nOFC that could be because I'm paranoid about screwing up my kid because I was really screwed up by my parents... so... grain of salt and all that.\n\nI guess if you stick to this one I'd definitely address the makeup more from the angle of \"you're treating makeup with too much importance\" rather than as a *punishment*...? Maybe?\n\nEither way I don't think you're being an AH. \n\nidk... good luck \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA-the consequence seems appropriate for what she did.", "You are NTA, seems like Jessica is, but she is coming from a (sorry to put it bluntly) broken home and it will take a long time for it to get better for her. Therapy and counselling, maybe a 1to1 session with Mum, even dad, and then some bonding time with Bella. It will be tough, but there is a lot of trauma in both of these children. Goodluck  \n\n\nEdit: After reading more of OP's responses, I am changing it to YTA for assuming your 15 YO daughter has not got any issues coming from a broken home. Divorce/seperation does things to children that they will keep deep within them likely until adulthood if not taken to therapy/counselling, but it comes out in bursts like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Remind her that these \"friends\" she has are all temporary and probably won't even hang out with her throughout the entirety of high school. The things she's putting importance on now will not matter in 5 years. Ask her if how she treats Bella is how she wants everyone to see her.

Teenage girls are always upset with their parents over **everything**. I know I was. The thing to focus on is letting her as your daughter know that no matter who comes into your life, she will always be a priority. Also, stop asking her if she'll do therapy, just send her. I agree with other comments that you need to spend more one-on-one time with Jessica so she can feel more at ease telling you what's going on before it gets to another blow up like this. If you want her to be emotionally mature you need to be emotionally mature yourself and treat her like her own person not an extension of yourself. The relationship between the girls will be what it is, you cannot force it, nor can you control the outcome. They will fight, and be fine, they'll go weeks without talking and may even actually fight each other at some point but you as a parent need to stay out of it. Send them to therapy separately first, only when ***their therapists*** think it's a good time do you start family therapy together with ALL of you present (Jessica, Bella, You, and your Husband) remember to listen to them and not to project your view of the situation as they will undoubtedly see it differently. \n\n You can't force this, they're too old to be convinced they're siblings- the best you can hope for is a non-contentious relationship between everyone.", "NTA Forcing bonding never works. Do not force friendship either, it leads to resentment. But do encourage respect, tolerance and politeness. Find out which of her friends are encouraging the behaviour and sort that out.

Y-T-A for throwing together two 15 year-olds and thinking anything but drama would come it.  One hormone filled 15 year-old is full of drama.  Blending families when they are of the age to be terrible enough to act like the worst children imaginable, but in age are closer to adults, is not going to go well.

I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m genuinely confused why using the thing that she\u2019s bullying someone over as the punishment makes OP a bad person.

If these \u201cfriends\u201d pick on her for it then they\u2019re not good friends and she should not be associated with them, regardless of whether it was about her step sibling. High school is rough but you hang with the bullies then you are a bully. If her being punished for being a dick to her siblings means her social life is ruined then her friends are absolutely shitty people.\n\nShe asked her calmly why she would do that and she doubled down with being horrible. Fashion & skincare is what means most so that\u2019s what gets taken as a punishment, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s taken forever. It\u2019s relevant to the situation and If that\u2019s what her insecurity is then she should learn that her actions are creating insecurities in others.

OP is not a bad person for defending a victim of bullying just because the bully happened to be her daughter.", "To me, it sounds like Jessica is a little too confident. \n\nI would only agree that OP is the AH IF OP took away her skincare. \n\nSince Jessica is looking down on others for not being fashionable, and placing herself on a pedestal, I think it\u2019s time she get knocked down.", "Is that Bella sucking up to you though since her dad is away all the time?", "criticism and love bombing????? until now Jessica and I have nto really had problems and I am trying to be there for her but she doesnt want to tlak to me at all I believe in not yelling my children as well so she had never been yelled at.", "Sorry I read that wrong.

I want to highlight a key point of the comment you were responding to here that I think may have been missed - focus on spending quality time with Jessica and making sure she has a chance to connect with you one on one and talk to you.  I realize right now while she's mad at you this may be difficult.  But keep trying regularly.  Maybe a mother-daughter mani-pedi session or lunch out on the weekend together.\n\nIt sounds like you're a great bonus mom to Bella, which is wonderful.  It's possible Jessica feels that she's lost your undivided attention and that is a contributing factor to her bullying Bella.  So try to address that potential root cause by giving Jessica some dedicated attention.  Have your husband make a point of doing father-daughter dates with each girl individually when he's in town as well.  They may roll their eyes and be grumpy about it but it will probably mean a lot to them.\n\nAnd definitely get each of the girls a good therapist.  Honestly, every teenager should get regular therapy because it's a tough age.  Blending families adds an extra factor, so having an objective, sympathetic adult to talk to can help a lot.  \n\nIt helped my relationship with my adolescent daughter when her therapist who was very supportive with her gently pointed out that some of my daughter's expectations for me were unrealistic.  She settled down a lot and our relationship improved.  \n\nThe school counselors can be a good resource for therapists in the area who work with your daughters' ages.

I can suggest that but I feel like that is even more unfair", "I have three kids--ages 14-20.   I don't think yta..but I also don't think your punishment is going to do anything to improve the relationship between the girls.

You are going to cause more resentment between these two. What is it you actually want from your daughter? Have you talked with her about your expectations and how she can meet them? It\u2019s possible your daughter is also being bullied by these girls from inside the friend group. How do you want her to handle this? Does she have the skills to do it? If I were you, I\u2019d give her back her stuff. Taking away things is very reactionary parenting. I\u2019d talk with her. I\u2019d say I was very surprised to hear you talk about Stepsister that way. That doesn\u2019t sound like you. I\u2019m curious what is going on. Then I would listen. I would absolutely talk with her about how it hurt SS\u2019s feelings and if she feels good about that. Is this the kind of person she wants to be? I would tell her how you honestly feel. I think you can get a lot farther this way. I would be clear with her that the behavior is unacceptable, that she needs to apologize but you want to be a resource for support to her and an example of how to address conflict productively and calmly. Taking things away just creates more conflict. If you need to give a consequence after talking to her, I would do something that might help her like I think you need a break from this friend group outside of school for a bit. Something like that. YTA I guess", "NTA but I straight up don\u2019t think your punishments will do what you want it to. Jessica is bullying Bella for a reason.

Unfortunately there are a lot of references for what the outcome of bullying can be. She really needs to understand that this is just the top of the iceberg.

She doesn't want to stick up for Bella, because she doesn't want them to turn on her too. But that's no excuse to be a bully. \n\nYou need to talk through the root of this with her. Ask: Do you think a person's value is based solely on what they look like? Do you think that people who aren't concerned about fashion are not as smart as people who do? Are you worried about your friends being mean to you if you don't agree with them? Are you scared about disagreeing with them on anything? What would happen if you said something else, like, \"Bella doesn't really care about fashion, but she's nice and she has other interests.\" instead of agreeing with them? Are you scared they would think less of you? Tease you for standing up for her? Bully you? What can you do to not be cruel yourself? Do you want to stay friends with mean people just because they're pretty and fashionable and \"cool\" or would you rather have true friends who value you for who you are?\n\nI just feel like you need to have a conversation with her and make her think through this and talk to you rather than just putting consequences on her for the behavior. \n\nI hope you'll find a way to get to the deeper heart of the matter. She's stuck between what you want, what Bella wants, what her friends want, and figuring out what she thinks herself. Being a teenager is hard. Help her navigate her way through it and be supportive of her emotional turmoil here. \n\nGood luck! I know it's hard.", "NTA", "NTA, but I'm very concerned that the issue Jessica has may be deeper than expected.\n\nYou said her dad has a younger girlfriend.  How old are we talking?  Is she 25?  30?\n\nI strongly worry there's some self-image issues going on here.", "Nta. She's just throwing a tantrum because she doesn't want to change.

I wonder could it be a case where she herself is also on the receiving end of really negative comments and for example all her friends are saying things about Bella and she joins in to be cool? \n\nI'm not trying to excuse it at all just trying to make sense of the mind of a teenage girl, I was one myself and I'll still never understand \ud83d\ude02", "NTA--the punishment does fit the crime, and like you, I'd be pretty horrified to find out that I *thought* I'd raised a kind child, only to find out she was really **a Mean Girl.**  \n\nLet her scream.

Both girls need support in dealing with all the transitions life has thrown at them. You need a professional who can help coach you in how to navigate these situations, which are not easy.

Its a wonder we're friends at all now, when I look back on some of the antics back in the day.  ;-)", "I would add it doesn\u2019t sound like Jessica is a nesscessarily a bad kid either. Peer pressure is hard at that age. And sometimes the way to fit in and get others to not bully you is to bully someone else. Not saying she shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for her actions. Moms doing a good job teaching her a lesson and correcting her behavior.

Those outside influences, coupled with how self centered and desperate to fit in teenagers are may cause teens to be pretty cruel. \n\nBut since she is still a child, you have to get involved and try your best to fix it.  The first step should be to find out which friends find it fun to be cruel to another girl for her clothes and not let them in your house anymore/ try to limit the time your daughter spends with them. Second, you should find out if your daughter has only ever been mean to her stepsister or if she has been bullying other kids at school.", "Indo think the prescribed skin care is too much, tbh.

Honestly I think your punishment of taking clothes and make up is really going to push the girls further apart. I get why you did it. The girls need therapy but o think your going to push your daughter away. I feel for your step daughter but my gut tells me that aside from peer pressure at school you\u2019ve more than likely have less time with your daughter and she feels it and she probably isn\u2019t happy with your bonding time with the SD. Therapy is needed and teens are hard. Reading your punishment made me think your so set on helping your SD that your welling to punish your daughter by taking away how she is \u201cfashionable\u201d like you want her to be bullied. How you look is a major part of your teen years. I highly doubt she\u2019ll learn a kindness lesson I am thinking she\u2019ll learn to hold more resentment against SD. I could be wrong . My suggestion if you\u2019ve read this far is after the dust settles have a heart to heart with daughter let her air all grievances she has about SD Step dad everything. Say something like this is a free pass no consequence to what she says to you during this conversation even if she calls SD names to you while talking. Really listen and read between the lines. Help her come up with solutions to what\u2019s bothering her. Help her understand that as hard as it is for her that her step sister is feeling many of the same things and how being bullied about step sister hurts her can she see how what she is doing hurts her. Yes she needs consequences for the bullying but I think emotionally she\u2019s hurting too and unless you guys can work this out now it\u2019s only going to get worse. Therapy is probably your best option at this point. I hate bullying my son was constantly bullied severely in school and I can tell you this it was elementary school when I spoke with the parent who gave her son an extreme harsh punishment I knew them (small town) I did talk to the kid myself with mom\u2019s permission and really listened to what he said and when he apologized I gave him a hug and forgiveness as well as spoke with my son and helped him understand that some things are just annoying to other. They did become friends later. This is partly why I think you need to truly understand where your daughters anger, frustration and hurt is coming from. Same with your SD I would bet there\u2019s more going on. I am not a step parent so I don\u2019t really know anything about blending a family. Best of luck I think your hearts in the right place and you love both your daughters and want what\u2019s best for them.", "Yeah I mean you can do what think is best. I just fundamentally disagree and this isn\u2019t how I raise my teenager. You are now locked in a power struggle which isn\u2019t productive.

How did you work to ensure you were a compatible family before blending? Did the girls know each other at all before living together? Did you all do family therapy when you got engaged? \n\nJessica's behavior isn't out of the blue. Have you investigated into what Bella has been doing at school? Is she inserting herself into your daughter's life and friends group,  or did you expect Jessica to do that? Does Bella have her own friends? Is this a new school for one of them? There's a lot going on behind the scenes here. \n\nI agree that Jessica needs consequences for her actions,  but it seems like you're maybe way focused on Bella since that's a trauma trigger for you. I think you really need to look into what's going on with Jessica that's making her act this way.  Maybe she doesn't like your blended family.  Maybe she feels less important/ left out since you now have another priority in your life that you seem to relate to more than your daughter.

How will you handle it if it turns out Jessica and Bella can't get along? \n\nThis is a short-term solution to a long-term problem, and both girls need a clear set of expectations for how to treat each other going forward. \n\nI think you're going in the right direction,  but this isn't the surface level problem you seem to think it is.", "Figure out how she can earn the clothes back.", "Whoa- I think maybe you're not grasping the context of trauma.

Be open to listening to what is truely going on. Let her say whatever she wants no matter how cruel you think it is (she is probably repeating what she has had to listen to which will give you some understanding of what she has to experience in this situation). then I would say well we have a problem here because while I get everything going on and I am going to help you. I think we should do therapy to help you process all these feelings and experiences and its not a choice but a requirement. \n\nI would also say that we need to work out a consequence for if you do this again (ownership you see) because I can not allow it in my home. Its our responsibility to ensure we dont cause damage to others because we are hurting. \n\nThis will be a process but therapy is the key. \n\nall the \u201cmean\u201d things she said\u2026its probably what she has had to HEAR.

And I think that informed how you punished your daughter. Remember, she was being treated badly by other kids for living with Bella. 15 year olds are cruel and also don\u2019t have a good sense of self so if her life is being made worse by her friends, she was upset and took it out on Bella. It doesn\u2019t mean she truly feels that way. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, that kind of behavior isn\u2019t ok no matter what. And there should be consequences for doing those things to another person. But taking away her clothes and makeup is a step too far.

The likelihood of that teaching her to not give in to peer pressure and to be more kind to others is small.

The amount of parents who clamp down when their kids react \u201cdisrespectfully\u201d when they get privileges taken away\u2026it\u2019s far too common. How you punish your kids has just as much impact as the punishment itself. Why not talk about your own experience to your daughter? Help her understand how what she is doing is wrong.

Younger sister went to the same school in a different grade, and was *very* image- and popularity- conscious. Not inherently cruel, just painfully aware of how she was perceived, and highly sensitive to judgement and criticism from other kids.\n\nYou can guess how much conflict that led to. Younger sister did love her older sister, and they mostly got along fine at home, but there were days when both girls came home upset - Older, because younger had given her the cold shoulder at school, and younger because her classmates had teased her about her sister\u2019s awkward behavior. And when they left school, all that frustration would explode outward and they\u2019d get into *big* fights. Younger didn\u2019t feel like she could control her classmates, and knew that standing up for her sister at school could cost her deeply, so she lashed out at her sister for being \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d because that was the only safe-seeming way to vent her feelings.

So talking through \u2018don\u2019t you feel x because you feel like you xyz?\u2019 Can help, if there\u2019s plenty of options to choose from. Her parents got divorced, two years later her mum is remarried (this is a really quick turnaround for children) and she has to coexist with a same age step sibling that she is obviously very different from, and even if she doesn\u2019t know her dad cheated on her mum, she knows (?) he has a girlfriend who is only 6 years older than her. That\u2019s a lot of crap to deal with. \n\nI do think the way you dealt with it was okay, but I\u2019d be very wary of taking makeup away if she has a lot of insecurity, as it would likely cut very very deep if it\u2019s hitting to her greatest insecurity, and you don\u2019t want her associating that pain with Bella, but her behaviour really wasn\u2019t acceptable\u2026 but if she is between a rock and a hard place with her friends making fun of her because of Bella and she feels social pressure to conform with them\u2026 teenage girls are pack animals, and at 15, friends can be way more important/influential to a child\u2019s world than parents even. \n\nI just\u2026 I really don\u2019t want for you to unintentionally make things worse between Bella and Jessica, because petty arguments and perceived (even if not actual) mistreatment in favour of step siblings can really poison the well for years to come.

Teach her things to say like \u2018everyone has their own style\u2019 or something when her friends bring it up, instead of following along.

I've tried a couple discount stylists through like Amazon and stuff and they can never get my style right because their version of punk influenced is just... off.", ">15 yo female bullies are not the object of teasing, usually - they are popular and control most social situations they are in.\n\nI don't know where you're getting this, but it's more movie trope than reality.   \n\n\nIt's actually super common for middle of the pack girls to ostracize girls they think they can get away with bullying to try to be accepted by the mean girls.", "But it\u2019s different because in \n\nOP story: kid was bullying someone based on appearance \n\nOther story: kid was smoking weed", "alright thanks for the adivce! sorry about your finger tho..", "no she is perfectly clean, she just has sort of a \"emo hippie\" style", "ty", "im punishing her for bullying?", "Family therapy, limited device time if any at all, limited to no contact with that friend group outside of school - for starters", "You put that your daughter is bullying your stepdaughter because her friends are \u201cteasing her for having to live with her.\u201d \n\nAmazing. So your step-daughter admits to being bullied and gets one-on-one attention/ice cream etc. Your daughter admits to being excluded by her friendship group/bullied by them because your step-daughter has an admittedly \u201calternative style\u201d that you think is \u201cunique and creative\u201d but she gets punished? Just a little bit of favouritism going on there. \n\nI may get jumped on for saying this but kids are bullied for everything. If your step-daughter has an out there and attention seeking style then *of course* your daughter is teased for that. *Of course* she\u2019s lashing out to her step-sister because her *friends* are bullying/teasing her for it. Of course she\u2019s mad. Her Dad has left, her mother has rapidly remarried, she now shares her life with someone who has a unique style and her friends are laughing at her for it. So what do you think will help? Taking away all but her prescribed skincare? I\u2019m gonna assume she has acne/other skin conditions if it\u2019s dermatological stuff which means she\u2019s probably self-conscious anyway and all you\u2019ve done is compound that by taking away the things that give her confidence. Well done! You\u2019ve really helped!", "I probably did something to deserve it, I gave as good as I got. \n\nGood luck!", "I think you have a friend problem  more than a daughter problem then. That's a very loaded word to say about someone imo.", "Your punishing her for not standing up for her step sister against her classmates bullying her. She didn't start it. Her friends did. Yes she would be a great person for taking a stand. But she's a teenager and doesn't want to loose her friends over the weird new girl in her life. So she joined in.  I'm not saying she didn't do anything wrong. But punishing her isn't going to make her be friends with her stepsister", "She\u2019s feeling humiliated.  She\u2019s not feeling remorse or empathy despite \u201ca logical punishment.\u201d\n\nI really think you both would benefit from therapy.  Teaching and fostering empathy and kindness is not a one punishment fix.", "she didnt say she got bullied she said her friends said it was gross that she lvies with bella to which jessica then continued to say cruel thigns to bella and spread rumors... there isnt favourtism i am just not so overjoyed my daughter is being so mean", "you are mixing metaphors or something here. I am not sure you are responding to OP or me. It seems like it is me so ,\n\n1. few \u2260 my kids are always telling me they hate me\n2. if you set boundaries your kids are going to be mad and they use a limited vocabulary meant to push your buttons and hurt you - that is what they do. The smallest thing can trigger the I hate you  from a child - wrong thing for dinner? I hate you. No you cannot watch XYZ tv show - I hate you.  and so on. \n3. what part of what I said made you think I am unapologetic? \n4. what part of what I said made you think I am always right?  \n\nYou are putting your own attitude on my post. In connecting with OP I mentioned a couple of things which you seem to have taken seriously out of context. \n\nTo be clear my kids are grown ass now and frankly some of the most amazing people I've ever known. I wish I could tell you all about the things they do and their very interesting and wonderful career paths and lives.", "If they do that is leverage. The reason I make a suggestion like that is because a lot of interpersonal conflict is environmental. Remove the environment and the conflict dissolves. If for example it is true that a friend said it was \"Gross\" she had to live with Bella. If that person wasn't a friend or there to say anything would your daughter?\n\nI'd certainly change schools before getting a divorce as you suggest.", "Do you think they will agree with your punishment?  Taking clothing and makeup away the way you describe is a pretty nuclear move.  Are you sure your ex would go along with it?  If not, you hung yourself out to dry.", "Mum also now has a daughter who is more like her in personality and fashion sense. Jessica likely feels like she is being replaced with preferred daughter.", "If both girls like the school they're already at and have their own friends there why do you think it would resolve things between them to force one of them to uproot and go to a new school? Imo it would just drive a wedge further between them since whichever is made to leave would blame the other for that change and probably hold resentment towards them for it.", "Cake does sound good right about now.", "Four months to go and you will see that little slice of cake pop up for your magical day!", "no i have the same fashion sense as jessica thats why i buy her clothes most of the time smh.", "Perhaps it will be enough motivation to be civil then?", "r/unexpectedportal", "Very true, especially the YouTube part. \nHowever, with the added layer of the daughter being around people as well as being a person that bullies other people based on their looks, and reacting with crying when her makeup is taken away, she seems to put a lot of value on the make up and what it does for her. It just wouldn't surprise me if the daughter has self-esteem issues already."]}
