Your daughter clearly needs to get her points straight (if this makes any sense). Indeed what she did was extremely cruel and as much as she dresses \"within the norm of cool\", things can flip and what's cool can soon be deemed \"hideous\" a she puts it. It's sad that sometimes we thing we raise kids to be kind and empathethic and something like this happens and makes you wonder where in the hell they got it from (I don't have any kids but I'd be devastated by it). Hopefully she can learn from her mistake.\n\nAlso, good you stood by your stepdaughter! She clearly needed the support. It might take time but hopefully they can get along fine (maybe not besties, but at least not like this).", "NTA. \n\nDo I think Jessica needs consequences? Yes. Do I think taking away clothes and makeup will make her see the error of her ways?

Based on X situation and the way you are currently speaking to me, you seem to have forgotten this.\u201d And \u201cSad choices have sad consequences.\u201d \n\nA favorite consequence in my family is being grounded from something until some kind of assigned reading is done.

You did a great job supporting your stepdaughter. I think the biggest issue here is that Jessica feels pressured by her friends into acting a certain way. She isn't able to stand up to them and defend someone who doesn't dress like the group likes. Peer pressure is going to make her do things down the road she may not want to do but feels like she has to in order to be accepted.

Taking makeup/clothing from a 15 year old, especially one for whom it's a career interest *feels* wrong to me(?) But if I look at it logically... \n\nI think it sounds like Jessica is placing a level of importance on makeup/fashion which is a bit extreme at her age. Like with anything else, if you can't use it responsibly, you shouldn't be using it. And the consequence is at least moderately related to the behavior (taking the clothing, at least... idk about the makeup).\n\nSo I'm trying to think about why it feels wrong, to me. And I'm thinking back to when I was that age, and I had... lots of sisters and stepsisters lol\n\nI can imagine *Jessica* seeing this as... \"Mom's trying to kiss up to stepdad by defending steptroll and forcing me to be as hideous as she is\". Because, yknow... teens are self-absorbed AHs sometimes and don't learn what we want them to learn. This could actually lead to... like there will probably be a short period where she's nice to Bella to get her stuff back, but long term... treating Bella even worse.\n\nAnd, conversely this bothers me a bit:\n\n> other than her skincare prescribed by her dermatologist\n\nI think it might be possible that Jessica is... overcompensating? Is she self-conscious due to a skin condition? Taking makeup away in that case could amplify any body image/insecurity issues. This is also supported by the comment that she started teasing Bella because her friends were making fun of her for living with her.\n\nIt is an fashion-related consequence for fashion-related bullying, so I don't necessarily think it's an inappropriate consequence.\n\nAnd I think you handled the conversation with Bella beautifully, and addressed Jessica with the right *level* of severity.\n\nIt's just...  not even the clothing. I think the clothing/phone consequences are spot on... it's just that if I was the parent implementing these consequences with my teen... I'd be really uncomfortable with taking her makeup. Something just feels off about it.\n\nOFC that could be because I'm paranoid about screwing up my kid because I was really screwed up by my parents... so... grain of salt and all that.\n\nI guess if you stick to this one I'd definitely address the makeup more from the angle of \"you're treating makeup with too much importance\" rather than as a *punishment*...? Maybe?\n\nEither way I don't think you're being an AH. \n\nidk... good luck \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA-the consequence seems appropriate for what she did.", "You are NTA, seems like Jessica is, but she is coming from a (sorry to put it bluntly) broken home and it will take a long time for it to get better for her. Therapy and counselling, maybe a 1to1 session with Mum, even dad, and then some bonding time with Bella. It will be tough, but there is a lot of trauma in both of these children. Goodluck  \n\n\nEdit: After reading more of OP's responses, I am changing it to YTA for assuming your 15 YO daughter has not got any issues coming from a broken home. Divorce/seperation does things to children that they will keep deep within them likely until adulthood if not taken to therapy/counselling, but it comes out in bursts like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should have done that before getting married.", "NTA for the punishment she thought she was superior to her stepsister because of her makeup and clothes so you took them away. \n\nI think you should sit her down and get her to explain to you why she thought it was acceptable to bully anyone let alone someone you live with. Remind her that these \"friends\" she has are all temporary and probably won't even hang out with her throughout the entirety of high school. The things she's putting importance on now will not matter in 5 years. Ask her if how she treats Bella is how she wants everyone to see her.

Teenage girls are always upset with their parents over **everything**. I know I was. The thing to focus on is letting her as your daughter know that no matter who comes into your life, she will always be a priority. Also, stop asking her if she'll do therapy, just send her. I agree with other comments that you need to spend more one-on-one time with Jessica so she can feel more at ease telling you what's going on before it gets to another blow up like this. If you want her to be emotionally mature you need to be emotionally mature yourself and treat her like her own person not an extension of yourself. The relationship between the girls will be what it is, you cannot force it, nor can you control the outcome. They will fight, and be fine, they'll go weeks without talking and may even actually fight each other at some point but you as a parent need to stay out of it. Send them to therapy separately first, only when ***their therapists*** think it's a good time do you start family therapy together with ALL of you present (Jessica, Bella, You, and your Husband) remember to listen to them and not to project your view of the situation as they will undoubtedly see it differently. \n\n You can't force this, they're too old to be convinced they're siblings- the best you can hope for is a non-contentious relationship between everyone.", "NTA Forcing bonding never works. Do not force friendship either, it leads to resentment. But do encourage respect, tolerance and politeness. Find out which of her friends are encouraging the behaviour and sort that out.

Y-T-A for throwing together two 15 year-olds and thinking anything but drama would come it.  One hormone filled 15 year-old is full of drama.  Blending families when they are of the age to be terrible enough to act like the worst children imaginable, but in age are closer to adults, is not going to go well.  You have one kid that lost a parent and is afraid to rock the boat and you have your daughter who has shown absolutely despicable behavior.", "NTA\n\nYou made the right decision by taking her clothes and makeup away, after all, the first step is to stop her awful behavior.

I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m genuinely confused why using the thing that she\u2019s bullying someone over as the punishment makes OP a bad person. It\u2019s not an excuse that she\u2019s having a hard time. She doesn\u2019t have to be friends, she doesn\u2019t have to like her but she doesn\u2019t get to get away with being down right horrible to someone over fashion choices and allowing her \u201cfriends\u201d to join in. \n\nBullying can cause long lasting impact on the victim and she\u2019s old enough to know better. If these \u201cfriends\u201d pick on her for it then they\u2019re not good friends and she should not be associated with them, regardless of whether it was about her step sibling. High school is rough but you hang with the bullies then you are a bully. If her being punished for being a dick to her siblings means her social life is ruined then her friends are absolutely shitty people.\n\nShe asked her calmly why she would do that and she doubled down with being horrible. Fashion & skincare is what means most so that\u2019s what gets taken as a punishment, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s taken forever. It\u2019s relevant to the situation and If that\u2019s what her insecurity is then she should learn that her actions are creating insecurities in others. She should know better than most how it feels and should not participate. OP is not a bad person for defending a victim of bullying just because the bully happened to be her daughter.", "To me, it sounds like Jessica is a little too confident. \n\nI would only agree that OP is the AH IF OP took away her skincare. \n\nSince Jessica is looking down on others for not being fashionable, and placing herself on a pedestal, I think it\u2019s time she get knocked down.", "Is that Bella sucking up to you though since her dad is away all the time?", "criticism and love bombing????? until now Jessica and I have nto really had problems and I am trying to be there for her but she doesnt want to tlak to me at all I believe in not yelling my children as well so she had never been yelled at.", "Sorry I read that wrong.

Your advice is horrible. Is Jessica wrong for bullying his Stepsister? Yes, she is. Should she get consequences? Yes, she should. But you forget that children who are bullies are not bullies out of nowhere. Jessica is a child, she is 15, she doesn\u2019t act like that out of nowhere. There is something going on with her and OP should look what it is. Only punishing her will definitely NOT help.", "fair enough ty for ur input :)", "Holy cow - it\u2019s my cake day.  Thank you!!  Good luck to you - it\u2019s sounds like you are doing your best in a hard situation.", "I agree with the consequences you imposed.  I want to highlight a key point of the comment you were responding to here that I think may have been missed - focus on spending quality time with Jessica and making sure she has a chance to connect with you one on one and talk to you.  I realize right now while she's mad at you this may be difficult.  But keep trying regularly.  Maybe a mother-daughter mani-pedi session or lunch out on the weekend together.\n\nIt sounds like you're a great bonus mom to Bella, which is wonderful.  It's possible Jessica feels that she's lost your undivided attention and that is a contributing factor to her bullying Bella.  So try to address that potential root cause by giving Jessica some dedicated attention.  Have your husband make a point of doing father-daughter dates with each girl individually when he's in town as well.  They may roll their eyes and be grumpy about it but it will probably mean a lot to them.\n\nAnd definitely get each of the girls a good therapist.  Honestly, every teenager should get regular therapy because it's a tough age.  Blending families adds an extra factor, so having an objective, sympathetic adult to talk to can help a lot.  \n\nIt helped my relationship with my adolescent daughter when her therapist who was very supportive with her gently pointed out that some of my daughter's expectations for me were unrealistic.  She settled down a lot and our relationship improved.  \n\nThe school counselors can be a good resource for therapists in the area who work with your daughters' ages.  Local FB and Nextdoor groups as well.  Many FB groups allow you to post anonymously so you can make the request without revealing your daughters' identities.
