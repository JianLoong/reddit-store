Your daughter clearly needs to get her points straight (if this makes any sense). Indeed what she did was extremely cruel and as much as she dresses \"within the norm of cool\", things can flip and what's cool can soon be deemed \"hideous\" a she puts it. It's sad that sometimes we thing we raise kids to be kind and empathethic and something like this happens and makes you wonder where in the hell they got it from (I don't have any kids but I'd be devastated by it). Hopefully she can learn from her mistake.\n\nAlso, good you stood by your stepdaughter! She clearly needed the support. It might take time but hopefully they can get along fine (maybe not besties, but at least not like this).", "NTA. \n\nDo I think Jessica needs consequences? Yes. Do I think taking away clothes and makeup will make her see the error of her ways?

Based on X situation and the way you are currently speaking to me, you seem to have forgotten this.\u201d And \u201cSad choices have sad consequences.\u201d \n\nA favorite consequence in my family is being grounded from something until some kind of assigned reading is done.

You did a great job supporting your stepdaughter. I think the biggest issue here is that Jessica feels pressured by her friends into acting a certain way. She isn't able to stand up to them and defend someone who doesn't dress like the group likes. Peer pressure is going to make her do things down the road she may not want to do but feels like she has to in order to be accepted.

Taking makeup/clothing from a 15 year old, especially one for whom it's a career interest *feels* wrong to me(?) But if I look at it logically... \n\nI think it sounds like Jessica is placing a level of importance on makeup/fashion which is a bit extreme at her age. Like with anything else, if you can't use it responsibly, you shouldn't be using it. And the consequence is at least moderately related to the behavior (taking the clothing, at least... idk about the makeup).\n\nSo I'm trying to think about why it feels wrong, to me. And I'm thinking back to when I was that age, and I had... lots of sisters and stepsisters lol\n\nI can imagine *Jessica* seeing this as... \"Mom's trying to kiss up to stepdad by defending steptroll and forcing me to be as hideous as she is\". Because, yknow... teens are self-absorbed AHs sometimes and don't learn what we want them to learn. This could actually lead to... like there will probably be a short period where she's nice to Bella to get her stuff back, but long term... treating Bella even worse.\n\nAnd, conversely this bothers me a bit:\n\n> other than her skincare prescribed by her dermatologist\n\nI think it might be possible that Jessica is... overcompensating? Is she self-conscious due to a skin condition? Taking makeup away in that case could amplify any body image/insecurity issues. This is also supported by the comment that she started teasing Bella because her friends were making fun of her for living with her.\n\nIt is an fashion-related consequence for fashion-related bullying, so I don't necessarily think it's an inappropriate consequence.\n\nAnd I think you handled the conversation with Bella beautifully, and addressed Jessica with the right *level* of severity.\n\nIt's just...  not even the clothing. I think the clothing/phone consequences are spot on... it's just that if I was the parent implementing these consequences with my teen... I'd be really uncomfortable with taking her makeup. Something just feels off about it.\n\nOFC that could be because I'm paranoid about screwing up my kid because I was really screwed up by my parents... so... grain of salt and all that.\n\nI guess if you stick to this one I'd definitely address the makeup more from the angle of \"you're treating makeup with too much importance\" rather than as a *punishment*...? Maybe?\n\nEither way I don't think you're being an AH. \n\nidk... good luck \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA-the consequence seems appropriate for what she did.", "You are NTA, seems like Jessica is, but she is coming from a (sorry to put it bluntly) broken home and it will take a long time for it to get better for her. Therapy and counselling, maybe a 1to1 session with Mum, even dad, and then some bonding time with Bella. It will be tough, but there is a lot of trauma in both of these children. Goodluck  \n\n\nEdit: After reading more of OP's responses, I am changing it to YTA for assuming your 15 YO daughter has not got any issues coming from a broken home. Divorce/seperation does things to children that they will keep deep within them likely until adulthood if not taken to therapy/counselling, but it comes out in bursts like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should have done that before getting married.", "NTA for the punishment she thought she was superior to her stepsister because of her makeup and clothes so you took them away. \n\nI think you should sit her down and get her to explain to you why she thought it was acceptable to bully anyone let alone someone you live with. Remind her that these \"friends\" she has are all temporary and probably won't even hang out with her throughout the entirety of high school. The things she's putting importance on now will not matter in 5 years. Ask her if how she treats Bella is how she wants everyone to see her.

Teenage girls are always upset with their parents over **everything**. I know I was. The thing to focus on is letting her as your daughter know that no matter who comes into your life, she will always be a priority. Also, stop asking her if she'll do therapy, just send her. I agree with other comments that you need to spend more one-on-one time with Jessica so she can feel more at ease telling you what's going on before it gets to another blow up like this. If you want her to be emotionally mature you need to be emotionally mature yourself and treat her like her own person not an extension of yourself. The relationship between the girls will be what it is, you cannot force it, nor can you control the outcome. They will fight, and be fine, they'll go weeks without talking and may even actually fight each other at some point but you as a parent need to stay out of it. Send them to therapy separately first, only when ***their therapists*** think it's a good time do you start family therapy together with ALL of you present (Jessica, Bella, You, and your Husband) remember to listen to them and not to project your view of the situation as they will undoubtedly see it differently. \n\n You can't force this, they're too old to be convinced they're siblings- the best you can hope for is a non-contentious relationship between everyone.", "NTA Forcing bonding never works. Do not force friendship either, it leads to resentment. But do encourage respect, tolerance and politeness. Find out which of her friends are encouraging the behaviour and sort that out.

Y-T-A for throwing together two 15 year-olds and thinking anything but drama would come it.  One hormone filled 15 year-old is full of drama.  Blending families when they are of the age to be terrible enough to act like the worst children imaginable, but in age are closer to adults, is not going to go well.  You have one kid that lost a parent and is afraid to rock the boat and you have your daughter who has shown absolutely despicable behavior.", "NTA\n\nYou made the right decision by taking her clothes and makeup away, after all, the first step is to stop her awful behavior.

I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m genuinely confused why using the thing that she\u2019s bullying someone over as the punishment makes OP a bad person. It\u2019s not an excuse that she\u2019s having a hard time. She doesn\u2019t have to be friends, she doesn\u2019t have to like her but she doesn\u2019t get to get away with being down right horrible to someone over fashion choices and allowing her \u201cfriends\u201d to join in. \n\nBullying can cause long lasting impact on the victim and she\u2019s old enough to know better. If these \u201cfriends\u201d pick on her for it then they\u2019re not good friends and she should not be associated with them, regardless of whether it was about her step sibling. High school is rough but you hang with the bullies then you are a bully. If her being punished for being a dick to her siblings means her social life is ruined then her friends are absolutely shitty people.\n\nShe asked her calmly why she would do that and she doubled down with being horrible. Fashion & skincare is what means most so that\u2019s what gets taken as a punishment, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s taken forever. It\u2019s relevant to the situation and If that\u2019s what her insecurity is then she should learn that her actions are creating insecurities in others. She should know better than most how it feels and should not participate. OP is not a bad person for defending a victim of bullying just because the bully happened to be her daughter.", "To me, it sounds like Jessica is a little too confident. \n\nI would only agree that OP is the AH IF OP took away her skincare. \n\nSince Jessica is looking down on others for not being fashionable, and placing herself on a pedestal, I think it\u2019s time she get knocked down.", "Is that Bella sucking up to you though since her dad is away all the time?", "criticism and love bombing????? until now Jessica and I have nto really had problems and I am trying to be there for her but she doesnt want to tlak to me at all I believe in not yelling my children as well so she had never been yelled at.", "Sorry I read that wrong.

Your advice is horrible. Is Jessica wrong for bullying his Stepsister? Yes, she is. Should she get consequences? Yes, she should. But you forget that children who are bullies are not bullies out of nowhere. Jessica is a child, she is 15, she doesn\u2019t act like that out of nowhere. There is something going on with her and OP should look what it is. Only punishing her will definitely NOT help.", "fair enough ty for ur input :)", "Holy cow - it\u2019s my cake day.  Thank you!!  Good luck to you - it\u2019s sounds like you are doing your best in a hard situation.", "I agree with the consequences you imposed.  I want to highlight a key point of the comment you were responding to here that I think may have been missed - focus on spending quality time with Jessica and making sure she has a chance to connect with you one on one and talk to you.  I realize right now while she's mad at you this may be difficult.  But keep trying regularly.  Maybe a mother-daughter mani-pedi session or lunch out on the weekend together.\n\nIt sounds like you're a great bonus mom to Bella, which is wonderful.  It's possible Jessica feels that she's lost your undivided attention and that is a contributing factor to her bullying Bella.  So try to address that potential root cause by giving Jessica some dedicated attention.  Have your husband make a point of doing father-daughter dates with each girl individually when he's in town as well.  They may roll their eyes and be grumpy about it but it will probably mean a lot to them.\n\nAnd definitely get each of the girls a good therapist.  Honestly, every teenager should get regular therapy because it's a tough age.  Blending families adds an extra factor, so having an objective, sympathetic adult to talk to can help a lot.  \n\nIt helped my relationship with my adolescent daughter when her therapist who was very supportive with her gently pointed out that some of my daughter's expectations for me were unrealistic.  She settled down a lot and our relationship improved.  \n\nThe school counselors can be a good resource for therapists in the area who work with your daughters' ages.  Local FB and Nextdoor groups as well.  Many FB groups allow you to post anonymously so you can make the request without revealing your daughters' identities.

You are going to cause more resentment between these two. What is it you actually want from your daughter? Have you talked with her about your expectations and how she can meet them? It\u2019s possible your daughter is also being bullied by these girls from inside the friend group. How do you want her to handle this? Does she have the skills to do it? If I were you, I\u2019d give her back her stuff. Taking away things is very reactionary parenting. I\u2019d talk with her. I\u2019d say I was very surprised to hear you talk about Stepsister that way. That doesn\u2019t sound like you. I\u2019m curious what is going on. Then I would listen. I would absolutely talk with her about how it hurt SS\u2019s feelings and if she feels good about that. Is this the kind of person she wants to be? I would tell her how you honestly feel. I think you can get a lot farther this way. I would be clear with her that the behavior is unacceptable, that she needs to apologize but you want to be a resource for support to her and an example of how to address conflict productively and calmly. Taking things away just creates more conflict. If you need to give a consequence after talking to her, I would do something that might help her like I think you need a break from this friend group outside of school for a bit. Something like that.

She doesn't want to stick up for Bella, because she doesn't want them to turn on her too. But that's no excuse to be a bully. \n\nYou need to talk through the root of this with her. Ask: Do you think a person's value is based solely on what they look like? Do you think that people who aren't concerned about fashion are not as smart as people who do? Are you worried about your friends being mean to you if you don't agree with them? Are you scared about disagreeing with them on anything? What would happen if you said something else, like, \"Bella doesn't really care about fashion, but she's nice and she has other interests.\" instead of agreeing with them? Are you scared they would think less of you? Tease you for standing up for her? Bully you? What can you do to not be cruel yourself? Do you want to stay friends with mean people just because they're pretty and fashionable and \"cool\" or would you rather have true friends who value you for who you are?\n\nI just feel like you need to have a conversation with her and make her think through this and talk to you rather than just putting consequences on her for the behavior. \n\nI hope you'll find a way to get to the deeper heart of the matter. She's stuck between what you want, what Bella wants, what her friends want, and figuring out what she thinks herself. Being a teenager is hard.

Moms doing a good job teaching her a lesson and correcting her behavior.

The first step should be to find out which friends find it fun to be cruel to another girl for her clothes and not let them in your house anymore/ try to limit the time your daughter spends with them. Second, you should find out if your daughter has only ever been mean to her stepsister or if she has been bullying other kids at school.", "Indo think the prescribed skin care is too much, tbh.

Honestly I think your punishment of taking clothes and make up is really going to push the girls further apart. I get why you did it. The girls need therapy but o think your going to push your daughter away. I feel for your step daughter but my gut tells me that aside from peer pressure at school you\u2019ve more than likely have less time with your daughter and she feels it and she probably isn\u2019t happy with your bonding time with the SD. Therapy is needed and teens are hard. Reading your punishment made me think your so set on helping your SD that your welling to punish your daughter by taking away how she is \u201cfashionable\u201d like you want her to be bullied. How you look is a major part of your teen years. I highly doubt she\u2019ll learn a kindness lesson I am thinking she\u2019ll learn to hold more resentment against SD. I could be wrong . My suggestion if you\u2019ve read this far is after the dust settles have a heart to heart with daughter let her air all grievances she has about SD Step dad everything. Say something like this is a free pass no consequence to what she says to you during this conversation even if she calls SD names to you while talking. Really listen and read between the lines. Help her come up with solutions to what\u2019s bothering her. Help her understand that as hard as it is for her that her step sister is feeling many of the same things and how being bullied about step sister hurts her can she see how what she is doing hurts her. Yes she needs consequences for the bullying but I think emotionally she\u2019s hurting too and unless you guys can work this out now it\u2019s only going to get worse. Therapy is probably your best option at this point. I hate bullying my son was constantly bullied severely in school and I can tell you this it was elementary school when I spoke with the parent who gave her son an extreme harsh punishment I knew them (small town) I did talk to the kid myself with mom\u2019s permission and really listened to what he said and when he apologized I gave him a hug and forgiveness as well as spoke with my son and helped him understand that some things are just annoying to other. They did become friends later. This is partly why I think you need to truly understand where your daughters anger, frustration and hurt is coming from. Same with your SD I would bet there\u2019s more going on. I am not a step parent so I don\u2019t really know anything about blending a family. Best of luck I think your hearts in the right place and you love both your daughters and want what\u2019s best for them.", "Yeah I mean you can do what think is best. I just fundamentally disagree and this isn\u2019t how I raise my teenager. You are now locked in a power struggle which isn\u2019t productive.

How did you work to ensure you were a compatible family before blending? Did the girls know each other at all before living together? Did you all do family therapy when you got engaged? \n\nJessica's behavior isn't out of the blue. Have you investigated into what Bella has been doing at school? Is she inserting herself into your daughter's life and friends group,  or did you expect Jessica to do that? Does Bella have her own friends? Is this a new school for one of them? There's a lot going on behind the scenes here. \n\nI agree that Jessica needs consequences for her actions,  but it seems like you're maybe way focused on Bella since that's a trauma trigger for you. I think you really need to look into what's going on with Jessica that's making her act this way.  Maybe she doesn't like your blended family.  Maybe she feels less important/ left out since you now have another priority in your life that you seem to relate to more than your daughter.

How will you handle it if it turns out Jessica and Bella can't get along? \n\nThis is a short-term solution to a long-term problem, and both girls need a clear set of expectations for how to treat each other going forward. \n\nI think you're going in the right direction,  but this isn't the surface level problem you seem to think it is.", "Figure out how she can earn the clothes back.", "Whoa- I think maybe you're not grasping the context of trauma.

Be open to listening to what is truely going on.

I think we should do therapy to help you process all these feelings and experiences and its not a choice but a requirement. \n\nI would also say that we need to work out a consequence for if you do this again (ownership you see) because I can not allow it in my home. Its our responsibility to ensure we dont cause damage to others because we are hurting. \n\nThis will be a process but therapy is the key. \n\nall the \u201cmean\u201d things she said\u2026its probably what she has had to HEAR.

Obviously we're a bunch of strangers from the internet, but the punishment does feel a bit targeted and petty.

Ground her, remove her phone and pocket money and then get her some therapy as well.", "But you just said her dad is dating a younger woman, so she doesn't go there as much?", "I am trying to get my daughter into therapy and get her to talk to me but she striaght up doesnt want to", "I never stated that OP should ignore any issues Jessica is going through. You have a tendency to put words in my mouth. \n\nAll I did was defend OP\u2019s consequences and reaffirm my belief that they aren\u2019t abusive. You are the one that pranced in, screaming I should never have children, and just assume that I\u2019m anti-therapy because I didn\u2019t type her out a mini-essay.", "2. no we bought a new house period\n\n3. she does visit him\n\n5. her mom died??\n\n6. she did respond, she called Bella ugly yet again..\n\n7. he is during holidays etc\n\n8. that is true but we make alone time aswell\n\n9. not sure about that tbh\n\n10. her acne is gone fully\n\n11. the divorce didnt have much fighting, her father cheated on me so we divorced\n\n12. I dont want them to be bffs I want them to be nice to eachother at least", "no she does she doesnt really love his gf but she loves her father so", "Let her cool down, she is probably mad because of the whole situation. Talk to her alone just the two of you if something is going on with her, if everything is alright in school, if she has a problem with the new family situation. If something else is bothering her. Talk to her in a tone that makes her feel \u201ewelcome\u201c. Maybe she will open up to you then, don\u2019t mention bella or the bullying, you can do that later. Ask her what is going on in HER LIFE with HER maybe she will open up to you. You said she never acted like that, right?\n\nI could be wrong and maybe your daughter is just an asshole and a mean girl but i highly doubt it.", "You literally just said \u201eget her a goodwill wardrobe with a most granny-like clothes.\u201c do you really think this will help anyone or will change anything? If thats your correct punishment for your child than yes, you shouldn\u2019t get children because that\u2019s not parenting and can only make everything worse.", "Because every single time you comment it comes off as you favoring Bella (wich you do) it\u2019s great that you want your step daughter to be comfortable and it sucks that your daughter has become a bully but honestly forget about Bella for a bit. Sure spend time with her ect but your daughter needs you right now and even if she is being rude and cruel to you LISTEN to her and get her help. You think they got along all this time I hate to break it to you but this behavior has probably been happening the entire time or just now boiled over.", "Some people yes, this can be but it\u2019s not the majority. You can google that, watch documentaries. Children who are bullies are not always bullies because they are \u201ejust mean\u201c. That\u2019s not how that works. I work with children and teenagers myself.", "Makeup at 15 doesn't necessarily mean there's a self-esteem issue.  Girls are wearing it pretty young now... It's very common with my daughter's 12 and 13yo classmates.  They start following those YouTube tutorials early!", "I certainly think it will knock her off of her pedestal. Her issue is that she\u2019s looking down on others for not being fashionable. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be fashionable. Being fashionable is a luxury. \n\nNotice how I never dismissed therapy? Notice how I never dismissed digging deeper? I simply didn\u2019t mention it. This is all about whether or not the consequences are right or not, which I believe they are more than reasonable.", "It doesn't come off that way at all. Quit projecting.", "Key word is \u201calways.\u201d \n\nI acknowledged that bullying can be a chain reaction. At the same, it isn\u2019t ALWAYS. \n\nI also NEVER SAID any of Jessica\u2019s issues should be ignored. If I did, I would love for you to highlight and reply to it. All I ever did was reaffirm that I didn\u2019t think OP\u2019s consequences were wrong and I would assign the same consequences in her shoes.", ">Alternative dressers arent \u201cshy\u201d and \u201cdont stand up for themselves. the whole POINT of it is to stand out.\n\nSo, what is the point of being super fashionable and use make up? Go by unnoticed? I'm sure that's it. \n\nAlso, are you saying Bella is bullied on purpose? Are you saying that bullied people and people who dress in a certain way deserve what they get? Are you saying people need to dress in a certain way to cater to the bullies' needs? Because that's what it sounds like. \n\nYou were a bully in school weren't you? That's bully talk. I can smell the sewage even from this side of the planet.\n\nNTA.", "You didn\u2019t mention it, you only mentioned another punishment for her daughter that will not HELP.", "You also never said that OP should look deeply in Jessicas issued. All you said was that she should give her granny clothes lmao. \n\nIt isn\u2019t always but its MOST OF THE TIME. You can literally google that."]}
