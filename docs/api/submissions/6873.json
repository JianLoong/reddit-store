It's a good sentiment to want to support the eatery, but ethically, you can really only do that with your own money, not your friend's.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's a discount that only PWD are supposed to get and it would have been breaking the rules to let him use it even though he's not disabled, then I would agree with not giving him the card.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
