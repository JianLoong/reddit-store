On top of that Why didn't they pay to get him his own room cause I doubt he wanted to share a room with them.", "NTA for at least three reasons \n\n1) Assuming same pricing, they paid $1,800 for him to go and share their room, instead of $2,200 they would have to pay if he had his own room. You paid $2,200 so you could have your own room. If you had agreed you would have effectively given $400 in value (or the equivalent in their currency) to people you don\u2019t know. The overall pricing may be different because of flights, but the per person room cost was probably similar. \n\n2) As an introvert, the thought of sharing a room with a stranger, regardless of their age, is stressful. I would have said no for solely that reason. Especially at a destination wedding where I would hang out in my room every once in awhile to recharge after group activities, dinners, etc. Even if not introverted, you don\u2019t know these people at all and if anything should happen, you likely have little recourse. You have the right to privacy and personal space, and there should not have been an expectation that you share that space with a total stranger. It\u2019s also surprising that they would be okay with letting their kid share a room with a stranger, even if he is legally an adult. \n\n3) Although you shouldn\u2019t have to justify why you said no, you paid for a private room in the hopes of being intimate. If these strangers wanted to have intimate time without their child, they had the same opportunity as you and chose not to pay the additional cost. They are acting incredibly entitled by presuming that their desire for intimacy supersedes yours.", "NTA these parents are weird and entitled.", "NTA at all dirty old man.

And you\u2019re not a creep or dirty, you\u2019re a single adult, you do you.", "What nonsense, the parents cud have just sent the son out during the day if they really wanted to \"be intimate\". Plus he's freaking 19, just stay out late one night. Why wud they want him to share a room with a stranger. So weird. NTA", "NTA... Why would a parent allow their son to bunk with a stranger... You could be a John Wayne Gacy... No offense man.   And just because you hook up with random women doesn't mean you're a dirty old man lol.   As long as everything is consensual  who cares.  I'm sure she goes away happy.  I just can't get over this I want to dump ice water on those parents.  ...", "NTA, why would you let a random adult stay in your room. Why did they even bring and have thier adult son staying with them. That\u2019s weird AF. And asking for him to stay with a random guy at a wedding. Weirder.", "NTA", "First of all NTA, everyone else but your buddy is and his new wife is a massive one for even thinking it\u2019s acceptable to ask you. \n\nSecondly, please stop talking about yourself derogatorily, you\u2019re not a dirty old man and you are a good person. Just because everyone else around you believes in monogamy and the standard \u2018get married and have sex with one person only\u2019 life, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right for everyone and it\u2019s clearly not what you want for yourself. You go sleep around with as many willing people as you want and enjoy yourself, it\u2019s your life to do what you want with. \n\nThirdly, you WBTA if you don\u2019t tell us if you got your monies worth out of the room in the end\u2026 ;)", "NTA. JFC is this destination wedding a month long or something? I wonder what the kid thought of all this.", "Yeah that sounds awful for the kid. They come to this dumb wedding of their parents\u2019 friends and they end up getting passed around so people can bone alone. I\u2019d be pissed if my parents tried to pawn me off on some middle aged stranger, especially at 19, so they can try making me a sibling. I would hate sharing with some rando. I wonder if the kid even wanted to come at all", "And what teenager wants to be in a room with a stranger?!? I have two. They don\u2019t even want to be with ME let alone a stranger. They would be **furious.**", "Exactly! Why did they even bring their 19 y.o on the trip to begin with? \n\nOnly to force a stranger to babysit them? Nahhhhh OP. NTA. \n\nIf I were you I would have doubled down and asked the parents if they wanted you to teach their kid how to pick up one night stands. Haha \ud83d\ude02 \n\nYour single and entitled to your free time the way you see fit. Child free and all!", "Watching your parents hooking up or Stranger OP? What would you coose?", "Or they could have been a little more creative! At an all inclusive the kid has plenty of stuff to be occupied away from the room with. They missed plenty of opportunities for nooners.", "Maybe is harsh,  but considering how they treat their 19y old, maybe keeping their pants on is a VERY good idea regardless...", "Just like how the kid's parents had private plans for their room and didn't want to share with the kid, you also had private plans for your room and didn't want to share with the kid.", "You should meet my ex, she is by far the most entitled person I've ever met", "It was more clickbait title, which is fine", "She was cute. And I liked the accent.", "Honestly you planned your hookup activities in advance. The 19yo's parents didn't. You'd at least be a better example than they were.", "To me it wouldn\u2019t matter if you wanted to sit in your room and knit or have a wild time with hookers and blow\u2026 your paying to have a room to yourself\u2026 if they wanted rooms for themselves they should have paid for it\u2026", "Your honesty is very admirable. I aspire to be like you seriously.", "LOL, I love your honesty!\n\nNTA and if the parents wanted alone time they could have left their 19 year old at home, or gotten him his own room.", "For me that\u2019s not the point. I mean how awkward, embarrassing and traumatising is it for the son to know that his parents want him to sleep in a room with a total stranger (what if the stranger snores? Or smells? Or snores AND smells? Or likes young boys? \u2026or what if the boy sleeps in your room, nothing happens but next day the boy accuses you of being inappropriate? What happened with don\u2019t go with strange people?) JUST so they can have \u2018alone time\u2019??\n\nThey are telling their son that their sex life is more important than his safety and comfort AND the safety and comfort of a man they don\u2019t know\n\nThis is horrendous parenting and selfishness. NTA but all those people certainly are!!", "Lol i love the self awareness", "Yeah NTA,,,, I would have said no as well. I dont want some stranger in my room! What if the  kid is a theif???  he steal your jewlery, watch, etc etc", "You\u2019re honest. Single guy, you don\u2019t have to answer to anyone. No way would you want to share your room with a 19 yr old kid that you don\u2019t even know. The parents aren\u2019t honeymooners for crying out loud. They can pass up having a little nookie for one night. Not your problem. I\u2019ve traveled with my parents when I was younger, and shared hotel rooms, but they, to my knowledge, refrained from \u201c getting busy\u201d while my brother and I were with them.", "That's the damnedest thing. People are calling OP out for hooking up, but what's the reason the 19yo's parents wanted privacy? *Oh so that they could hook up!* The double standards are crazy.", "Neither. Sex is a myth as a way to keep the stork company under lock and key.", "Fully agree. I LOVE having a hotel room to myself. There\u2019s something extremely peaceful and luxurious about it to me. I would be completely appalled at some strangers trying to pawn their kid off on me. Hookup plans would have nothing to do with it. FFS. NTA", "Yeah and cheaper to manipulate you into paying for his stay.", "You sold yourself short OP, you made yourself sound like a molester lol... although you may have gotten more engagement than if you called the situation what it was: a normal single dude wanting his own hotel room to do normal single dude things, and NOT wanting a random teenager in his room. NTA obvs.", "So none of her friends wanted to share either huh? Shocking.", "Fucken thank you \n\n\ud83d\ude02", "INFO: how does having casual sex with another consenting adult make you a bad person? Or a \"dirty old man\" at that? As a woman in my 40s I take offence to that \ud83e\uddd0", "[removed]", "This is exactly it! OP paid extra so he could have privacy for adult activities. The parents specifically chose NOT to pay extra (for an extra room for their son) so they could have privacy for adult activities. \n\nOn what planet does it make sense for OP to pay extra for some random couple to fuck while OP babysits their kid?!? \n\nAs all parents know, if you want alone time, YOU pat the babysitter! The babysitter does NOT pay for your alone time.", "they should have left the kid at home!", "This could have been an educational moment for the Bro code done Barney style.", "There were no hookers...", "I live with my folks. They used to make a huge big deal when they needed alone time finally I said it's their own problem to schedule this.", "I actually did wind up sleeping in the hallway of my hotel for at least a few hours a night like 18 months ago when I stayed in one for 2 weeks after we lost our last place in a fire. \n\nExcept it was on a recliner.   The beds there fucking sucked.", "So he can hook up.", "And you had the nerve to say you\u2019re not a good person? \ud83d\ude02", "You're NTA by far", "You\u2019re a real G", "So how could you possible thing you\u2019re ta?", "My dad's best friend is like you. I call him my uncle. Grew up watching him spit incredible game and almost always making the catch no matter how hot they were. I was inspired and learned at least some of that. \n\nAlso; should have told the fiancee she's welcome to have the kid stay with her since she wants to be generous with rooms. What an entitled C***.", "Did you supply him with rubbers too, since parents couldn't seem to be bothered with thier own kid?\n\nI bet they pulled the \"can you switch seats for my kid?\" On the plane too... Entitled parents much?", "I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that's the specifics of the act, not the act itself, that are granting him the status.", "I also don't understand why the OP says he's not a good person. He's a person with healthy boundaries and the ability to say \"no\". \nI wouldn't want to share my room with anyone. When I travel with my kids, they always have an extra room that I pay for. If the parents of the 19 years old wanted privacy, they should have booked him a room. It's incredibly rude to not book an extra room and then ambush a person they don't even know.", "> As all parents know, if you want alone time, YOU pat the babysitter! The babysitter does NOT pay for your alone time.\n\nI mean, he\u2019s a little too old to need a babysitter. The parents just have to realize that it\u2019s possible to have sex at other times besides right before bed. \n\nThe kid is 19, not 9. Send him down to the pool for an hour in the afternoon or something.", "Im really enjoying the mental image of a parent patting a babysitter on the head. \"Goooood sitter, now roll over. Go on.\"", "The son was/is a 19 year old ADULT. So, who in their right mind thinks its ok, to ask *ANYONE* (Male or Female) to share their room with an Adult stranger?!?", "That\u2019s even stronger in the NTA direction, too. You had zero obligation to share your space at all\u2014and you allowed the kid to use your room at one point in spite of that fact. \n\nThe request was completely unreasonable, but you still gave up the room when you had no use for it. They were completely out of line here. You\u2019re in the clear.", "BEST\u2026TYPO\u2026EVER. also, NTA.", "Wow. That was really generous of you. Above and beyond. Resounding NTA vote from me.", "I like to do stiff too.", "So you\u2019re saying there was knitting and blow?", "Lmao, you say no hookers... was there blow?\n\n\nNTA either way, those parents AND the bride sound really entitled", "Damn\u2026 next time eh? \ud83d\ude1c", "Cut it out! You just made me choke on my candy. \ud83e\udee2", "I don't see a denial about the blow here...", "Don\u2019t call yourself a dirty old man then! There\u2019s nothing wrong with having sex without a relationship as long as everyone is on the same page. Whether you are aromantic or it\u2019s a personal preference, you have a right to live your life.", "Having a sex life doesn't make you dirty and being in your 40s doesn't make you old. Are you even a man? ;)", "Sounds like Op is surrounded by a bunch of judgmental AHs. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s been told a few too many times that being single and child free makes you a bad person (or unsuccessful, sad, gross, creepy, and so on), so he\u2019s gotten used to it.", "> I also don't understand why the OP says he's not a good person.\n\nBecause a bunch of people at the wedding were telling him that.", "oh GOD, stop it. I snorted my morning coffee while on a teams meeting. \n\nguess i should stop reading reddit while at work.", "Freudian stiff", "Same here!!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I mean, hookers get paid, and he was still getting some fun without paying. \ud83d\ude09\n\nMy real takeaway is that he didn't deny the blow. \ud83d\ude01", "I'm seconding this. As long as everything is consensual and he's not leading the partners on about it being anything now than a vacation fling there is absolutely nothing wrong or dirty with him getting some strange while he's there. Lord knows there's plenty of 40-something ladies who are down for some no-strings-attached fun at a vacation resort.", "I suspect it's because he views travel as a chance to have sex with people, not because he's childfree or single, and that's the part that people respond to so heavily (as well as being relevant to the story here).", "Very keen observation \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "He also didn't deny the Knitting \ud83d\ude02", "You dirty old man. You kissed that woman on the mouth, didn't  you?", "And if he was a woman he'd be liberated and 'living his best life '", "This made me LOL"]}
