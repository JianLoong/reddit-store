On top of that Why didn't they pay to get him his own room cause I doubt he wanted to share a room with them.", "NTA for at least three reasons \n\n1) Assuming same pricing, they paid $1,800 for him to go and share their room, instead of $2,200 they would have to pay if he had his own room. You paid $2,200 so you could have your own room. If you had agreed you would have effectively given $400 in value (or the equivalent in their currency) to people you don\u2019t know. The overall pricing may be different because of flights, but the per person room cost was probably similar. \n\n2) As an introvert, the thought of sharing a room with a stranger, regardless of their age, is stressful. I would have said no for solely that reason. Especially at a destination wedding where I would hang out in my room every once in awhile to recharge after group activities, dinners, etc. Even if not introverted, you don\u2019t know these people at all and if anything should happen, you likely have little recourse. You have the right to privacy and personal space, and there should not have been an expectation that you share that space with a total stranger. It\u2019s also surprising that they would be okay with letting their kid share a room with a stranger, even if he is legally an adult. \n\n3) Although you shouldn\u2019t have to justify why you said no, you paid for a private room in the hopes of being intimate. If these strangers wanted to have intimate time without their child, they had the same opportunity as you and chose not to pay the additional cost. They are acting incredibly entitled by presuming that their desire for intimacy supersedes yours.", "NTA these parents are weird and entitled.", "NTA at all dirty old man.

They should have planned ahead & paid more for their son to have his own room if they wanted to have uninterrupted sex. Adults have sex it sure in the hell doesn\u2019t make you a dirty old man. \n\nAnyone giving you grief should offer up their own room & a roll away for the son.
