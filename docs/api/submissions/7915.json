I've been with my fiance for 5 years. My fiance does like the dog but she is currently pregnant and experiencing massive migraines and has been snapping at everything. \n\nSo every morning when I get up I find my fiance already awake and at the table relaxing. As soon as I get out of the bed, my dog goes nuts. It's like super energy where she is running sideways, barking up a storm, jumping from the bed to the floor a million times (causing the apartment to shake because it's old asf), etc and I will sit there and sing made up songs to her and just fuck around with her. It is pretty noisy and I can be loud. It's just my way of interacting with my pet. I also have ADHD, so I'm fully aware that I can be ridiculously loud and sometimes I simply forget to tone it down. My fiance has complained about it a few times and I will absolutely try to tone it down for awhile but as fucked up as it sounds, the second she stops complaining and it's \"out of sight, out of mind\", I start doing it again. If I catch myself I apologize immediately but sometimes I don't even catch myself doing it. \n\nSo she has been getting up earlier than normal because she says she needs \"peace and quiet away from you and the dog\" because she can't hear herself think when we get up and then she starts getting migraines and being overall pissed off. But now she is complaining because I can sense her not in the bed anymore probably after twenty minutes of her being gone and her warmth no longer there and then I'm wide awake and the dog senses it and ya know. So she's now getting pissed because she thinks I'm purposely not letting her have space and purposely annoying her with my behaviors. I'm not, truly but it seems like it I guess. I've tried just laying in bed for awhile so she can relax but I get stir crazy and I also don't feel like I should have to stay in bed so she can be alone when I live here too. \n\nBut she flipped this morning. I felt her sneaking out of bed this morning at 5am and tiptoe out of the room. I watched her sit at the table with her book. Well, the dog saw me awake and immediately goes ballistic. Jumping on the bed, whining, barking, etc. She comes in and says \"will you guys calm down so I can have time to myself for once?\" I just side eyed her because I'm getting pissed at this point with her demands. She says \"well?\" I tell her to get over herself. Just because she's pregnant doesn't mean I have to change who I am or change how the household works or change my dynamic with my dog. She immediately left after telling me to go fuck myself and won't answer my calls. She's been gone for 6 hours.", "created_utc": 1674320931, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hw0kw/aita_for_telling_her_to_get_over_herself/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've been with my fiance for 5 years. My fiance does like the dog but she is currently pregnant and experiencing massive migraines and has been snapping at everything. \n\nSo every morning when I get up I find my wife already awake and at the table relaxing. As soon as I get out of the bed, my dog goes nuts. It's like super energy where she is running sideways, barking up a storm, jumping from the bed to the floor a million times (causing the apartment to shake because it's old asf), etc and I will sit there and sing made up songs to her and just fuck around with her. It is pretty noisy and I can be loud. It's just my way of interacting with my pet. I also have ADHD, so I'm fully aware that I can be ridiculously loud and sometimes I simply forget to tone it down. My fiance has complained about it a few times and I will absolutely try to tone it down for awhile but as fucked up as it sounds, the second she stops complaining and it's \"out of sight, out of mind\", I start doing it again. If I catch myself I apologize immediately but sometimes I don't even catch myself doing it. \n\nSo she has been getting up earlier than normal because she says she needs \"peace and quiet away from you and the dog\" because she can't hear herself think when we get up and then she starts getting migraines and being overall pissed off. But now she is complaining because I can sense her not in the bed anymore probably after twenty minutes of her being gone and her warmth no longer there and then I'm wide awake and the dog senses it and ya know. So she's now getting pissed because she thinks I'm purposely not letting her have space and purposely annoying her with my behaviors. I'm not, truly but it seems like it I guess. I've tried just laying in bed for awhile so she can relax but I get stir crazy and I also don't feel like I should have to stay in bed so she can be alone when I live here too. \n\nBut she flipped this morning. I felt her sneaking out of bed this morning at 5am and tiptoe out of the room. I watched her sit at the table with her book. Well, the dog saw me awake and immediately goes ballistic. Jumping on the bed, whining, barking, etc. She comes in and says \"will you guys calm down so I can have time to myself for once?\" I just side eyed her because I'm getting pissed at this point with her demands. She says \"well?\" I tell her to get over herself. Just because she's pregnant doesn't mean I have to change who I am or change how the household works or change my dynamic with my dog. She immediately left after telling me to go fuck myself and won't answer my calls. She's been gone for 6 hours.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am curious how you plan to have a newborn sleeping in your house with this going on every morning. You (and your dog) are in for a wild wake up call.", "Wow YTA and a big child with it. Your poor fianc\u00e9", "YTA, pregnant or not that sounds super obnoxious. I think most people would have a problem with this, ESPECIALLY first thing in the morning. I have little kids who would love to go ballistic as soon as they wake up but we work on saving that energy for the right time and place. If my kids can do it, so can you.\n\nIf your dog is like that first thing, take them outside. Go crazy with them at a dog park. Your wife's pain may be magnified because she's pregnant, but it would still be there even if she wasn't. Most adults don't like noise and rough housing in the morning, or even inside. Train your dog better and calm down. You're going to drive her away completely.", "yta.  Train your dog.  I am not pregnant, and I would be pissed. I would of complained a long time ago.

I've had them all my life and even the smallest sound can feel like a cheese grater scraping my brain. And I could take meds for them that still wouldn't get rid of them fully. The last couple years years I had severe migraines at least every day of the month besides maybe 1-2. It was horrible and my kids being loud, even talking to loud was awful. They would get so bad that I couldn't do anything but sleep because that is the only thing that made the pain go away. But when I would feel one coming on, loud or repetitive sounds made it worse, and they didn't stop hurting less if the sound stopped for a little bit. Maybe you should do some research on migraines and see how debilitating they can be. And as far as I know, Tylenol is the only safe pain killer for pregnant women to take and it doesn't typically help with migraines. NSAIDS can help some people. But not everyone and in my experience hormonal migraines have been more severe for me and if she hasn't been getting them regularly before being pregnant I would guess it's her hormones playing a big role in her getting them now and she can't control it.

Baby's need to sleep when they sleep and if you are to be acting this way and \"all about me\" about this, grow a pair. \nYou are not the main character right now, your pregnant fiance is. You need to train your dog and it should start now. If you don't know how, look it up.

You're not doing anything good for your dog either except enabling her and making her extremely difficult to live with, just like yourself.", "YTA. You need to start taking your dog outside for this morning routine. Your wife will get some quiet time and your dog will get to burn off some steam before coming back inside.

Everything hurts and many environmental factors (light and sound) make it worse.  Sometimes I get them so badly, the pain feels like it floods through my nerves and and I literally have trouble moving.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t blame your adhd.  My oldest and husband both has adhd but have enough sympathy and caring to consciously tone it down when I have a migraine.  My oldest is 7.  My youngest (4) also adjust their behavior and play quietly.  Adhd does not excuse you from literally starting your noisy routine shortly after your fianc\u00e9 tries to sneak out of bed for some quiet time, especially when she is trying to get up earlier and earlier.\n\nFinal note, train your dog and behavior.  You are about to have a new born shortly.  And yes, newborns should not have total quiet, but they also should not have a parent intentionally being noisy and encouraging the dog to do the same.", "YTA. Take the dog for a long walk so your gf gets some peace and quiet and the dog works off some of its energy.

I have ADHD too and it\u2019s not an excuse to be rude and selfish. Get up and take your dog to exercise outside like everyone else. Your little morning routine is excessively loud, long, and annoying.

You need to get with the program. Once that baby arrives you\u2019re going to need to get up multiple times during the night. You need to train your dog to stop freaking out whenever you get out of bed. You and your wife are going to need to sleep at different times and you\u2019re going to be sleep deprived enough without a dog who will wake up the whole household at once.
