I've been with my fiance for 5 years. My fiance does like the dog but she is currently pregnant and experiencing massive migraines and has been snapping at everything. \n\nSo every morning when I get up I find my fiance already awake and at the table relaxing. As soon as I get out of the bed, my dog goes nuts. It's like super energy where she is running sideways, barking up a storm, jumping from the bed to the floor a million times (causing the apartment to shake because it's old asf), etc and I will sit there and sing made up songs to her and just fuck around with her. It is pretty noisy and I can be loud. It's just my way of interacting with my pet. I also have ADHD, so I'm fully aware that I can be ridiculously loud and sometimes I simply forget to tone it down. My fiance has complained about it a few times and I will absolutely try to tone it down for awhile but as fucked up as it sounds, the second she stops complaining and it's \"out of sight, out of mind\", I start doing it again. If I catch myself I apologize immediately but sometimes I don't even catch myself doing it. \n\nSo she has been getting up earlier than normal because she says she needs \"peace and quiet away from you and the dog\" because she can't hear herself think when we get up and then she starts getting migraines and being overall pissed off. But now she is complaining because I can sense her not in the bed anymore probably after twenty minutes of her being gone and her warmth no longer there and then I'm wide awake and the dog senses it and ya know. So she's now getting pissed because she thinks I'm purposely not letting her have space and purposely annoying her with my behaviors. I'm not, truly but it seems like it I guess. I've tried just laying in bed for awhile so she can relax but I get stir crazy and I also don't feel like I should have to stay in bed so she can be alone when I live here too. \n\nBut she flipped this morning. I felt her sneaking out of bed this morning at 5am and tiptoe out of the room. I watched her sit at the table with her book. Well, the dog saw me awake and immediately goes ballistic. Jumping on the bed, whining, barking, etc. She comes in and says \"will you guys calm down so I can have time to myself for once?\" I just side eyed her because I'm getting pissed at this point with her demands. She says \"well?\" I tell her to get over herself. Just because she's pregnant doesn't mean I have to change who I am or change how the household works or change my dynamic with my dog. She immediately left after telling me to go fuck myself and won't answer my calls. She's been gone for 6 hours.", "created_utc": 1674320931, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hw0kw/aita_for_telling_her_to_get_over_herself/", "score": 10303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've been with my fiance for 5 years. My fiance does like the dog but she is currently pregnant and experiencing massive migraines and has been snapping at everything. \n\nSo every morning when I get up I find my wife already awake and at the table relaxing. As soon as I get out of the bed, my dog goes nuts. It's like super energy where she is running sideways, barking up a storm, jumping from the bed to the floor a million times (causing the apartment to shake because it's old asf), etc and I will sit there and sing made up songs to her and just fuck around with her. It is pretty noisy and I can be loud. It's just my way of interacting with my pet. I also have ADHD, so I'm fully aware that I can be ridiculously loud and sometimes I simply forget to tone it down. My fiance has complained about it a few times and I will absolutely try to tone it down for awhile but as fucked up as it sounds, the second she stops complaining and it's \"out of sight, out of mind\", I start doing it again. If I catch myself I apologize immediately but sometimes I don't even catch myself doing it. \n\nSo she has been getting up earlier than normal because she says she needs \"peace and quiet away from you and the dog\" because she can't hear herself think when we get up and then she starts getting migraines and being overall pissed off. But now she is complaining because I can sense her not in the bed anymore probably after twenty minutes of her being gone and her warmth no longer there and then I'm wide awake and the dog senses it and ya know. So she's now getting pissed because she thinks I'm purposely not letting her have space and purposely annoying her with my behaviors. I'm not, truly but it seems like it I guess. I've tried just laying in bed for awhile so she can relax but I get stir crazy and I also don't feel like I should have to stay in bed so she can be alone when I live here too. \n\nBut she flipped this morning. I felt her sneaking out of bed this morning at 5am and tiptoe out of the room. I watched her sit at the table with her book. Well, the dog saw me awake and immediately goes ballistic. Jumping on the bed, whining, barking, etc. She comes in and says \"will you guys calm down so I can have time to myself for once?\" I just side eyed her because I'm getting pissed at this point with her demands. She says \"well?\" I tell her to get over herself. Just because she's pregnant doesn't mean I have to change who I am or change how the household works or change my dynamic with my dog. She immediately left after telling me to go fuck myself and won't answer my calls. She's been gone for 6 hours.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You sound not compatible honestly. You make excuses fornyour ADHD instead of activley teying to improve and be a better partner", "YTA.\n\nAll these words to justify that you and your dog are simply plain annoying and disrespectful.", "YTA. She\u2019s changing her morning routine so she can get the quiet she needs, and it\u2019s still not enough.

You really need to check yourself and try to change your ways before the baby is here. Be respectful. It's about to get a lot harder.", "YTA, your dog isnt the issue either cause the pupper only matches your hyper energy.\nDo you want the baby be harmed when mom is constantly under stress??", "YTA\n\nAs a dog owner, it\u2019s pretty damn rude to rile up your dog in the early hours of the morning, or even the morning in general, before say, 11am. Luna\u2019s playtime is from 8-9:30 at night before most people go to bed, this is whack for not only your fianc\u00e9 but your neighbors too. You\u2019re setting that poor dog up for failure by not teaching it how to relax", "YTA - obedience classes for the dog (and, you) are long overdue.", "Overall, you sound like you might want to reconsider that whole \u201cI don\u2019t need to change who I am\u201d mindset.\n\nOr you can just resign yourself to a life of just you and the dog.\n\nYTA", "It's always men who don't understand how vastly different life is going to be once there's a baby. You're being very selfish and once the baby comes you're in for a very rude awakening. EVERYTHING changes when you have a baby.\n\nYTA. 100%.", "YTA. I am curious how you plan to have a newborn sleeping in your house with this going on every morning. You (and your dog) are in for a wild wake up call.", "Wow YTA and a big child with it. Your poor fianc\u00e9", "YTA, pregnant or not that sounds super obnoxious. I think most people would have a problem with this, ESPECIALLY first thing in the morning. I have little kids who would love to go ballistic as soon as they wake up but we work on saving that energy for the right time and place. If my kids can do it, so can you.\n\nIf your dog is like that first thing, take them outside. Go crazy with them at a dog park. Your wife's pain may be magnified because she's pregnant, but it would still be there even if she wasn't. Most adults don't like noise and rough housing in the morning, or even inside. Train your dog better and calm down. You're going to drive her away completely.", "yta.  Train your dog.  I am not pregnant, and I would be pissed. I would of complained a long time ago. You're going to have a baby soon and this won't fly. So, yes, the household is going to have to change and so is the dynamic with your dog.", "YTA pregnancy aside, migraines are no joke. Especially when you have them days, weeks in a row. By day two of a migraine, I can barely think straight, it makes my head spin. Migraines aren\u2019t a simple \u201ctake medicine and feel better\u201d always, and since she\u2019s pregnant, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not even allowed to take most medicines that would help.\n\nYou clearly don\u2019t care about her well-being or you would try even the slightest bit to not do this.

Try training your dog. Or go outside where it can burn off the hyper energy. Sounds like she may be wising up and is ready to cut ties with you since you refuse to modify your behaviour.", "YTA\n\nI don't know if you've ever experienced migraines but they are more than just a bad headache. I've had them all my life and even the smallest sound can feel like a cheese grater scraping my brain. And I could take meds for them that still wouldn't get rid of them fully. The last couple years years I had severe migraines at least every day of the month besides maybe 1-2. It was horrible and my kids being loud, even talking to loud was awful. They would get so bad that I couldn't do anything but sleep because that is the only thing that made the pain go away. But when I would feel one coming on, loud or repetitive sounds made it worse, and they didn't stop hurting less if the sound stopped for a little bit. Maybe you should do some research on migraines and see how debilitating they can be. And as far as I know, Tylenol is the only safe pain killer for pregnant women to take and it doesn't typically help with migraines. NSAIDS can help some people. But not everyone and in my experience hormonal migraines have been more severe for me and if she hasn't been getting them regularly before being pregnant I would guess it's her hormones playing a big role in her getting them now and she can't control it. But you can control yourself. Take your dog for walks first thing in the morning or something.", "YTA.  She gets up earlier to have some time for herself and you can\u2019t even give her that.  You\u2019re a major YTA.", "Dude, you and the dog need to shut up.

Your kid isn't even born yet and you're already a shitty parent. \n3. You're a shitty dog owner. As the owner and fur parent of a hyperactive super loud dog, you need to frigging train them and set up appropriate loud play times.

Baby's need to sleep when they sleep and if you are to be acting this way and \"all about me\" about this, grow a pair. \nYou are not the main character right now, your pregnant fiance is. You need to train your dog and it should start now. If you don't know how, look it up. You need to listen to the woman that is carrying your baby. \n\nIf my man was acting like this when I have migraine I would probably start to hold a grudge that is building up to explode. Stop this behavior now. Not main character right now! \n\nYTA!!!", "YTA So her pregnancy can't be an excuse, but your ADHD can? You're not doing anything good for your dog either except enabling her and making her extremely difficult to live with, just like yourself.", "YTA. You need to start taking your dog outside for this morning routine. Your wife will get some quiet time and your dog will get to burn off some steam before coming back inside. Do you have a dog park close by where your dog could get a really good run in the morning?", "Jfc YTA.", "YTA, and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re ready to be a father.", "Op, YTA.  \n\nMigraines suck.  Everything hurts and many environmental factors (light and sound) make it worse.  Sometimes I get them so badly, the pain feels like it floods through my nerves and and I literally have trouble moving.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t blame your adhd.  My oldest and husband both has adhd but have enough sympathy and caring to consciously tone it down when I have a migraine.  My oldest is 7.  My youngest (4) also adjust their behavior and play quietly.  Adhd does not excuse you from literally starting your noisy routine shortly after your fianc\u00e9 tries to sneak out of bed for some quiet time, especially when she is trying to get up earlier and earlier.\n\nFinal note, train your dog and behavior.  You are about to have a new born shortly.  And yes, newborns should not have total quiet, but they also should not have a parent intentionally being noisy and encouraging the dog to do the same.", "YTA. Take the dog for a long walk so your gf gets some peace and quiet and the dog works off some of its energy.

You will be glad you did when you have a baby who will otherwise be woken by your theatrics after a sleepiness night, and you will all be miserable.", "YTA. I have ADHD too and it\u2019s not an excuse to be rude and selfish. Get up and take your dog to exercise outside like everyone else. Your little morning routine is excessively loud, long, and annoying. PLUS, once the baby arrives, it\u2019s not only going to be dangerous to encourage your dog to do parkour all over the house, you\u2019ll essentially be purposely waking up your sleeping infant every morning by having choir practice with your dog, which is absolutely not going to work.\n\nYour life is changing. You need to get with the program. Once that baby arrives you\u2019re going to need to get up multiple times during the night. You need to train your dog to stop freaking out whenever you get out of bed. You and your wife are going to need to sleep at different times and you\u2019re going to be sleep deprived enough without a dog who will wake up the whole household at once.

Sucks ass.", "I\u2019m 100% sure he\u2019ll be very single soon. He appears so self absorbed, and uses his adhd as an excuse as to why he can\u2019t possibly change, or train his dog.

Op\u2019s solution?  Telling his fianc\u00e9 to get over herself.  \n\nYTA.  You are an incredible asshole.", "And the solution to all of this chaos is, if OP gets stir crazy and the dog is going stir crazy, take the fucking dog out for a walk, leave the pregnant partner at home in peace and everyone wins.

There's a really easy solution to this problem. Yet he's still insisting on aggravating his pregnant partner and being inconsiderate to her and literally everyone else who lives there. It's so simple and the fact that this idea hasn't crossed his mind is really ridiculous. Isn't that what normal people do anyway? When I had my dogs the first thing I did in the morning was take them out, not because they were going crazy but because they've been in for hours and have to use the bathroom. I bet he goes to the bathroom when he wakes up. If he's not taking the dog out first thing he's TA just for that. If he is taking the dog out and then bringing her back in just to play, knowing his partner is upset, that's even worse.", "Our cats only weigh 12 pounds each and I am *amazed* at how hard they can hit the floor when they're going nuts!

He's trained it to do that no matter what now.", "When you\u2019re pregnant and go to the ER all they do is push fluids and give diphenhydramine, like thanks for nothing.

Positive reinforcement for bad behavior.", "As this daughter, with this dad, she's hysterical and over-emotional, and he can't deal with her when she's like this. \n\nI get tears when I'm angry or frustrated, and even when I keep my calm and use reason to argue, including quoting him back to him, I'm not to be dealt with. I tried turning away once, so he couldn't see the tears and having the same discussion; it worked until, \"What is wrong with you? Look at me when I'm talking to you.\" He did not like it when I pointed out that I was crying during all those \"good points\" that I made. \n\nHe leaves the table, and magically, everything's fine in his world. One of us has ADHD; it isn't him. Oddly, I can remember to be considerate of others. When things matter, big things like people, I tend not to forget them.

Right? \n\nEveryone agrees like duh dumb@ss.\n\nThen he's all in about how his class is more expensive than that plane ticket (by a lot) and how his class is only at 9 am. It's our new trip to Hawaii this term, and just like that airplane leaving, his for closes at exactly 9 and doesn't open again until class is over. Attendance doesn't matter, but the quiz every class at 9:01 am does. \n\nNo one missed class for being late. Only a few people stayed home sick a day or two (way before covid).\n\nIt's one of three things about life I learned from lectures in college that matter in everyday life. Nearly two decades later, if I'm late to something, it's  because something bad or wholly unpredictable happened, or it's just not important enough for me to push myself. \n\nThat's a very tangential way of saying that OP's fianc\u00e9e and baby aren't important to him. His dog, and not having to give up anything he wants to do for even a second matter more. Also, didn't he say his apartment was so poorly constructed that playing with a Corgi shook the floors?

Big time, buddy.", "One of my favorite things ever about my husband's parenting was never winding the kids up. And doing all the night bottles (for twins).

It's just his Mom raised him right and his dad did too. \n\nThanks, PILs!", ">Just because she's pregnant doesn't mean I have to change...\n\nThat's literally exactly what that means. When your SO gets pregnant, you're supposed to step up and be more mature. Maturity means having respect for others in the household. If you can't change your behavior of immediately being loud af the moment you wake up, even at 5 AM when your pregnant gf is trying to have a single moment of peace and quiet, then YTA.

I know that riling up a dog to bark and run around at the crack of dawn while I sing at the top of my lungs is going to irritate the fuck not only out of my husband, but all of my neighbours as well.\n\nI don\u2019t need repeated reminders to not create a bunch of racket at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning. I\u2019m forgetful, not completely oblivious to the existence of other people.", "Exactly. That dogs knows that when dad is around there are no rules. That\u2019s the environment he\u2019s fostered", "Same here. I'm really hoping her extended silence is her making other living arrangements - I sure would be if someone was actively fucking with my migraines like that.", "Yea, idk. It's such a simple solution. I think it's more of an ego thing. He said it himself \"why should I have to change how I act or my relationship with my dog just because she's pregnant and we're having a baby?\". And of course the answer is glaringly obvious for most adults (who are actually adults) because obviously you have to change things when someone is pregnant and when the baby comes.", "I have upstairs neighbors with a baby but they\u2019re not too bad.  I\u2019d want to murder this guy.", "My ex threw a massive fit because he insisted on buying plants and putting them on this one thin ledge my cats always jumped on, and they\u2019d inevitably get knocked off; \u201cwhy should I have to change what I want to do because of the cats?\u201d Maybe because they are actual animals and you\u2019ve chosen to live with them in the home they\u2019re used to, and even know what will result in issues? Perhaps?? And this extended even further when I was pregnant, why should I not wake you up by eating Chinese food leftovers in bed at 2 am after youd finally fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion after vomiting for 12 hours? Why can\u2019t I smoke cigarettes in the basement, it\u2019s like a whole other floor away from you?? This poor woman, I hope she is smarter than me and runs now.", "I was so flipping mad reading OP\u2019s post as someone who gets chronic migraines and was pregnant with a dipshit as the dad (guess if we\u2019re still together or if that extended to other areas and he literally hasn\u2019t seen his child in 2 years\u2026) but for maybe the first time in history the comments have not only made me not want to do a homicide but have given me hope. The bar is still way down a mineshaft but it appears there may be a glimmer of sunlight down there", "#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "Exactly, it's OP who is hyping up the dog. When his fianc\u00e9e gets up the dog is clam and quiet, she is able to have peace with the dog in the house when OP is asleep. But when OP gets up the dog is all over the place and barks off the roof. And OP has the audacity to say *that's just how the dog is*. No, it's not the dog, it's OP and the fact that he taught the dog to act like this with him. \"Somehow\" the dog is not like this with his fianc\u00e9e, maybe because she didn't reinforce bad behaviour in the dog like OP did. OP should exercise the dog and reinforce good behaviour in the dog instead of using the dog as an outlet for his ADHD, to have someone to be erratic with.", "This response should be higher. This dog and the daily rough housing is a huge risk for a baby and a vet will absolutely put it down. The lack of care or concern OP shows for partner and baby is disgusting.", "I couldn\u2019t believe that part. He actually blamed her for waking him up because he no longer had her \u201cbody warmth.\u201d That\u2019s so pathetic and he is such an AH. I feel so bad for his poor fianc\u00e9e", "I\u2019m pregnant too and I feel your comment so deeply. It is so much harder than you anticipate it\u2019s going to be\u2026\n\nThe sheer exhaustion and fatigue is mentally draining\u2026it\u2019s such a struggle for me to drag myself to work every day because I just want to sleep all the time. I\u2019ve had covid(delta)and I can honestly say I preferred it to my pregnancy symptoms. I\u2019ve never felt this kind of fatigue in my life\u2026and I\u2019m only in my first trimester!!!\n\nPlus the morning sickness\u2026and the emotional turmoil\u2026and the food aversions\u2026I struggle to eat at EVERY meal, and I\u2019ve always been a foodie and celebrated food as a gift, now I look at it like it\u2019s poison every day. I have to force it in.\n\nI can\u2019t brush my teeth without gagging uncontrollably\u2026which means I\u2019ve lost my dinner 3 times while brushing my teeth, the dinner I had to work so hard to get down. I dread my bedtime routine because I\u2019m scared to brush my teeth.\n\nOn top of all that, the baby can sense the mothers emotions, so whenever I feel upset or sad, which I have no control over anymore, I also feel guilty, for making the baby feel my negative emotions.\n\nAnd have to deal with my father in law telling me I should lose weight(which is actually not recommended in pregnancy and I HAVE lost weight and I didn\u2019t mean to which I also feel anxious and guilty about), and that pregnancy isn\u2019t an illness\u2026yes I know that, but how exactly does knowing that help me in any way? My reply,\u201dNo, it\u2019s not, but it can kill you!\u201d, FIL,\u201dWell so can the flu!\u201d, Me,\u201dAnd the flu, is an illness!\u201d.\n\nSo tired of men, who will never be pregnant in their life, and their rotten attitudes towards pregnant people. Either be helpful or shut the hell up.", "I\u2019d be feeling a whole lot of dread if I were her. OP also fails to express how long she has been trying to work around his excessive behavior. Or how far along she is.", "Why would he even sing songs so loud in the morning? What a freakin weirdo. I haven't been so annoyed by an OP in a while. This one wins the award.", "Ugh I love that he's totally helpless about it. \"Well the dog knows I'm up, there is literally nothing I can do to prevent it from being loud and obnoxious\" when we known damn well he has created that pattern...seeing as the dog doesn't do it with the fiance...\n\nI wouldn't want to raise a kid with that guy.", "I agree. My husband has ADHD and he would always make sure when I was pregnant that I had my quiet time and rest while he gamed on mute, and had music in headphones. He never would have disrupted my sleep like this. And he made sure our TWO dogs were quiet and didn't wake me or baby.", "Also corgis are notoriously barky,  noisy little shits. They absolutely must be trained because they're naturally dialed to 11.", "Honestly the ADHD part is especially dumb because...it doesn't turn people into inconsiderate assholes who pull this shit and makes it okay, of course, but my ADHD makes me unable to tolerate loud noises or certain sounds at specific pitches. This shit would drive me insane. Fuck this guy tbh", "Not borderline. Abuse does not have to be physical to be crossing a Huge line.", "Yeah, the need to train that dog immediately.", "And I bet the complete lack of respect for her is recent or more blatant now that he feels like she's trapped. A partner who lacks empathy, does things like this to exert power over you, and meets any attempt to hold him accountable with contempt and anger is not only incompatible with healthy relationships, but often leads to abuse. Hell, this could very well be an abusive tactic already. Thinking a reasonable boundary of someone you claim to love is an act of control you're entitled to steamroll is a big red flag. There's not really a logical explanation for it aside from intentionally making her miserable because he can.", "I'm unmedicated and if I ever am rude or think I've been inadvertently rude I ...apologise? Imagine that lol.", "Holy balls I didn\u2019t even think about the nightmare this woman will have to live once the dog and the singing fool wake the baby up every time she closes her eyes", "BUT OP has ADHD, so that makes it alright - in his mind.\n\nSorry, but ADHD, being on the spectrum, other mental health issues might explain bad behaviours, but they should never be an excuse for bad behaviour.", "When I was looking for somewhere to live a few years ago, I knew my parent's cat had just given birth and they wanted me to have one of the kittens and I knew zoomies was a thing so I went for a ground floor flat mostly so I wouldn't get stressed about disturbing downstairs neighbours (there were personal health considerations too but cat zoomies was one of the considerations I had lol), I can't imagine going through that effort only to end up living underneath someone like OP and his dog \ud83d\ude02", "Well, he is dumb, so probably doggy style", "i have ADHD, and i own a corgi. i sing her songs, and we have a morning routine but it\u2019s a whisper sing, because damn who needs to be hollering at 6am?? she and i can do our morning routine while my boyfriend sleeps next to me and he won\u2019t even wake up. because it\u2019s quiet and respectful. \n\nidk what the f this dude is getting on about. also. my corgi waits patiently until i lift her off the bed to the floor because jumping from that height is SO bad for their bodies. this guy is going to find himself either paying thousands of dollars on vet care due to negligence, or more likely he sounds like he\u2019d just post the poor dog on facebook and give her away, and go get another cute puppy.\n\ni\u2019m so fucking tired of people using adhd as some sort of blanket excuse to be a selfish asshole.", "Yup. Especially when she can't take any medication because she's pregnant. When I get migraines any loud noise feels like someone is actively and repeatedly stabbing my skull. I'm so pissed at OP for his immature and inconsiderate behaviour"]}
