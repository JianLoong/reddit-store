In extreme cases, they'll weaponize a suicide attempt to put the onus on the other person to solve their problems.

Like, convinced I\u2019m dying, hurting myself, needing to be held down and drugged panic attacks. During them my mind does not think clearly at all. All logic is out the window. Now, personally, even in the moment I would never get upset at someone in your situation for not putting me first. But everyone\u2019s different.\n\nI\u2019m still gunna go with NTA either way, but I\u2019m wondering if your friend said that stuff to you mid panic attack and regretted it later, or if she said that in her right mind and/or didn\u2019t apologize and stuck to it after the panic attack ended. It sounds like the latter, and if so she\u2019s definitely TA. But if this was a more in the moment thing that she feels bad about, yes it still sucks, yes she needs to apologize, and yes she needs better coping methods, but I recommend hearing her out if she wants to talk about it. Panic attacks can be really fucking terrifying and it can be hard to not feel abandoned when you don\u2019t have someone to lean on. This is not your fault OP, but it\u2019s also not hers. What is her fault is rather than learning to manage and deal with these feelings, she chose to blame you for them. You are not responsible for managing other\u2019s emotions.\n\nWith that being said, again, if she said this to you with a clear mind, and is standing by it, there is no doubt in my mind that she is TA, and she needs professional help because her current state of mind will do nothing but alienate those around her and make everything worse.", "NTA. \n\nAs someone with anxiety, you can't expect your SO to be there 24/7. If my SO is at work and I'm having panick attacks THAT BADLY, I will call a friend or family member to come get me and my SO will talk to me on the phone until I calm down or my medications kick in. \n\nThis sounds like a bid to control you.", "NTA\n\nComing from someone who suffers from anxiety and panic attack. She can ask others for support. You've already planned to be helping your dad, he needs you too.", "These are the times that people tell you who they really are. Believe them. \n\nI have gone through a \"friend/partner\" sorting a few times, like when my best friend did not call, show up, ask how to support me after my 21 year old daughter was in a very serious car accident, not her fault, that left her hour by hour on death's door ultimately leaving the hospital, 6 month stay, as a paraplegic. Last time I spoke to my friend she basically said it is the life she, my daughter, deserves because she is a bitch, my daughter would not date her son nor would she give him the time of day after we learned he punched his girlfriend because he was drunk and she would not get in a car with him,  to which I told my friend I supported all the people who dropped him.\n\nPeople like these are vampires on your emotions, feeling, morals, and support.

I get her wanting support, but why did it have to be in person when you already had your dad to care for. What was the expectation here?  That you leave your father who just had surgery to hold her hand?\n\nI am not downplaying the need for mental health support.  I fully understand how bad anxiety attacks can be and the need for help.

That\u2019s not your responsibility to fix, but effective communication is reallllly hard when you\u2019re being beaten up by anxiety and panic. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t serious about this relationship, it\u2019s more considerate to end things. Let her move on and find a relationship more committed. \n\nOf course - I\u2019m reading a lot between the lines here. So I could be way off base!

She's playing games.", "Having that sense of responsibility toward your dad, and wanting to help him... that's something a partner should value and support, tbh. It suggests to me that you'd be a caring partner who sets the right priorities, and the fact that your gf's pissed she isn't your priority says a lot about her.  \n\nDoes she need some help today? Yes. As someone with anxiety and panic attacks, I'm sympathetic. But I'm guessing she has other friends and a social circle who could probably help her (I mean, what did she do before she met you? Why can't she do that now?), whereas it's unlikely your dad has anyone else who's going to stay with and help him, and he also needs considerably more help right now than she does. \n\nYou're doing the right thing, and the right girlfriend would recognize that.", "INFO:\n\nCould this possibly be a powerplay on her part?", "When I get anxiety attacks, I get really quiet, and after however long it's gone on, I usually don't have any energy to fight or accuse people of anything. Now, during an anxiety attack, I can be easily irritated, and feel like everyone is bothering me.

Scariest thing I have ever experienced in my life. If shes having multiple in a day I don't know how she'd have the energy for anger. She may also not know what a true panic attack actually is, although reading some other descriptions on here, they can vary a bit person to person. Nevertheless I don't feel anger that you're not there with her would be a normal first reaction. Personally, I would call you and get you to reassure me of things and help me ground myself. Surely you're not the only person in her life that could help her out during this. I'd also say that because she only wants you in person and not to talk over the phone she is trying to assert some kind of control of you and that was the test.

I do not believe that they had MULTIPLE in a short amount of time and then started arguing with you and all this shit.\n\nNo matter what they need therapy. Like intensive. They need more people in their support network. You are not their service animal. You are allowed to be a person.", "It was the first thing that crossed my mind - how old is this woman?", "That was my first thought. Do her panic attacks often line up with your priorities?", "That's because you seem like a decent human being. It was def a test. In her eyes, you failed, but you passed with flying colours. Within a year if you stay with her, you will only have her in your life. No friends, no family. That's her eventual goal.", "If it were me, I'd try to gently say that you need to step back to support your father. If she genuinely cares about you, then she should want to support you as well.
