But this early into a relationship, she should have coping skills for herself or a trusted person to rely on that is not a boyfriend of one month.", "Totally agree with everyone below. NTA. Run away fast!", "OP you did the right thing ignore that person. Hope your dad's recovery goes well.", "Don't listen to them. You offered a compromise by texting or calling her later. \n\nYou put your dads health first as you should in this situation. He just had surgery, he can't even get up. What if you had left, he tried to go to the bathroom, fell and reopened his wound?\n\nPanik attacks suck, I know, but they can be dealt with. And if this wasn't her first then she should know what to do. You dad has a real emergency. He physically can't take care of himself. \n\nI hope that she is just insensitive because of the aftereffects of the panic attack, but please be wary of the way she is acting now. If she calms down and apologized, then good. If she keeps trying to make you feel bad then I would take a hard look on your relationship. \n\nYou sound like a good person and sadly some people are willing to take advantage of that. I have met my own emotional vampires in my life. They always want support or a listening ear, but as soon as you need the same they try to make you feel bad. Because everything isn't about them anymore.", "My point stands. I\u2019ve have multiple surgeries and multiple big surgeries and not one time did I need 24/7 care. My dad who had brain surgery didn\u2019t even need 24/7 care. There is absolutely no reason dog or not that you couldn\u2019t have slipped away for an hour or so. Take the dog out to potty, have everything your dad might need around him and say I\u2019ll be back in an hour or so.", "Hence why I said she sucked too. Reading comprehension too hard for you?", "Honestly. he said it to me :) We've always been super close", "And she should be asking if she could help you with your father's care.", "This is actually really consistent with anxious attachment or abandonment issues, and it's not really to us to speculate on whether her story is true. (Also low key misogynist to do so) \n\nRegardless,  op is nta. This is a clear case of him not having capacity to help for obvious reasons and her expectations are super outta line.  \n\nRed flag? Yes. Definitely just attention seeking. Nope.\n\nEta: source: i work in mental health.", "Well bully for you! Funny how hospitals give instructions about needing care 24 hours post surgery and no driving for 24 hours after general anesthesia. You should know this after so many surgeries.", "The hernia was so bad he had to have surgery\u2026the dad absolutely needs 24/7 care for probably a couple of days. They don\u2019t need to be actively caring for you the whole time but no the caretaker should not leave. \n\nNot sure what you consider big surgery but hernia surgery is usually the life saving variety.", "INFO: Did your dad not have anyone with him post-surgery? Not his wife, a child, a relative, a friend? We are not talking \"DID he need care\" but \"DID someone hang out with him after a surgical procedure\".", "[removed]", "Thats great. Sometimes its still hard for guys my age (and older, which I assume your dad is) to talk about stuff like that.  \n\n\nI was having a bad asthma thing recently while walking with the fam to the car, and my son (12) was the first that noticed. Little dude hung back to make sure I was ok, and tried to support me while we walked (like the he could lift my fat ass). I made sure to tell him how proud that made me.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
