The best reaction is to refuse to be shocked. \n\nReacting with an appalled scolding would just get giggles and determination to keep doing it, since it works.", "NTA. She's just jealous because that's the most penis she's gotten in a long time.", "NTA personally I think kids should use the technical terms for body parts, they should not be forbidden, they should not be 'bad' words, and I agree they would probably have done it more if you had reacted.", "NTA. My grandson was testing out the F word when I was serving him lunch one day. He tried it about five times. I never acknowledged the word, just kept on with our conversation. Never heard the word again.\n\nGrandson tried it out on dad who reacted. So grandson would repeat it to get a reaction out of dad.", "NTA. You responded appropriately and the other parent has an issue.", "NTA interesting technique but an effective way to shut down a penis game early. Btw its your profile name not the title that caught my interest", "NTA. Totally agree with your take on this. It\u2019s not a swear word, and the whole point of their game was to try and set you off. You made the game less fun.", "NTA, he said penis, big deal. That is a perfectly normal word and the only thing I would check is if he knows what he is saying. You know, explain the term. (we can't tell how old he is, but I'm guessing quite young?)\n\nBoys do play dumb games, this one I would not worry about either.", "You handled this situation perfectly. The best way to get your kids to stop playing the stupid game is to draw no attention to it. They'll get bored very quickly. NTA.", "NTA for not playing into their hands. The other mom was TA for butting into something that didn't concern her. That said, I might have  talked to my son later, in private, regarding certain words and how certain other people react to them. It may prevent problems down the road.", "NTA it isn't a swear word and it's just a stupid kids game", "NTA \n\nYoure spot on with your parenting technique. \n\nIts a dumb game most kids give a try at some point or another\n\nGlad to know the penis game is alive and well with todays youths though haha", "NTA. I played the penis game 16 years ago and it hasn't changed since then.\n\nIt's a stupid game designed to push the boundaries and upset the pearl clutchers. You're 100% right if you ignore their nonsense there isn't the risk of getting yelled at and the premise of the penis game falls apart.", "NTA\n\nThe other parent may be uncomfortable because her child is asking what is a penis and it\u2019s his pee pee, privates, etc .\nWhich if that\u2019s the case, is ridiculous.\nIgnoring was the way to go. \n\nIs it wrong that I\u2019m hoping next time they\u2019ll say vagina!\n\nI", "NTA. She wants you to be a helicopter parent, it doesn't make you a trashy asshole to avoid that.\n\nSure, it might be disruptive to other kids. \"Penis\" isn't a swear word but it's \"inappropriate\" in many families. But the playground is (presumably) a public space, so that woman could tell her own children that your kid and his friends are gross and shouldn't be imitated - she can parent how she wants, you can parent how you want.
