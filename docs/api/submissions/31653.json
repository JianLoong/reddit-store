This was the first time I was going to have a chance to really spend some time with his friends. They were all really good people and we were all having a great night. \n\nAt one stage, I offered to get everyone beers out of the fridge and when I crouched down, I accidentally let out a small fart. I was sooo embarrassed but thankfully one of his friends (female) made a joke about her farts being a lot worse than that, so it kind of broke the awkwardness and everyone laughed, and didn\u2019t think it was a big deal (thankGod)\n\nMy boyfriend, however, didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the night. He barely talked to anyone. He had a really sulky look on his face. When everyone left he asked me to leave too and said he couldn\u2019t believe that I was (a) so unmannered that I would fart in public, (b) not apologise to everyone for farting, and (c) that I didn\u2019t apologise privately to him because I humiliated him in front of his friends, and he thinks he wants to break up.  \n\nI was too stunned to argue but as I walked home I felt he was being totally ridiculous and decided I really didn\u2019t want to try and work this out. \n\nHe asked me the following day via text if I had thought about what he said, to which I responded \u2018yes, and I think I agree we should break up\u2019. He immediately called to berate me for being so selfish and an apology would have fixed everything\u2026. I don\u2019t feel the need to apologise though?! AITA?\n\nEDIT- since it has been asked, I completely forgot to say that after his friend broke the ice with her joke, I said \u2018excuse me\u2019 in a silly voice while we were still laughing. I was too mortified that I was mute until that joke was made. My BF seemed to want formal apologies.

Your instincts were right. This guy is not worth it. \n\nFWIW if my wife farted in front of our friends my biggest challenge would be containing my laughter. Farting is not a sin.", "NTA, small accidental farts happen here and there and that is completely okay. Are you sure that there isn\\`t actually a 7yo kid in a body of a 27yo person? Because imo, that kind of behaviour like his is really childish, to get that fussy about a measly tiny fart plus no one of his friends blamed you or took it to their heart.\n\nThat excuse for a grown up person has some really twisted views when it comes to how a woman should act.", "NTA. His friends thought it was funny and now he has to explain to them that he broke up with you because you farted.", "That's absurd. Let it go sister. Everyone does it. If that bothers him so much, he's too much of a little boy to be dating.", "NTA.\n\nI think it's best to apologize when people notice that I farted, but being so embarrassed that you couldn't do it hardly seems like an asshole move. The friend who said her farts are worse sounds like a class act. (Not something you normally hear about someone making fart jokes, I know, but she was supporting you!)\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like a complete anus. I mean, making such a big deal about it and even threatening to break up over it? If he's acting so weird about such a minor thing, my advice would be to accept his kind offer of breaking up. \n\nI mean, if he's so weird about one little fart, god knows what will happen the first time you try period sex.", "NTA. If a single fart requires a public apology to his friends and a second to him in private afterwards on threat of breaking up, then I dread to think what other ridiculous rules he would come up with for other natural bodily functions.", "Even if it weren't an accident, he could get over himself.  It's a fart. Everyone does it. It's not that serious.  He just needs a reason to break you down so he can try to control you.  Run from this, run fast, and don't look back. Use your farts to help propel you to safety.", "Totally NTA.. I would have just said excuse me.. and carried on tho. but dude needs to realize that girls fart too..", "NTA, a couple that farts together stays together. \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb", "NTA. That guy needs to be an ex.", "NTA - and spot on - \u2018yes, and I think I agree we should break up\u2019. \n\nI mean if you ever have a kid he most certainly could not deal with all that comes out of . . . everywhere.  Men (and women) who can't handle normal bodily functions need therapy.", "Lol that break up threat blew up in his face, pun intended. NTA. The berating are the last spasms of someone who has lost their sense of control over you", "NTA!! You didn\u2019t mean to do it on purpose- he reacted terribly. I wonder how he\u2019ll be if you guys get married and are with each other 24/7- or have kids who fart, burp, and do all types of gross stuff uncontrollably. Is he the type of person you want to live with and depend on??", "NTA - run bestie. Run far, far away.", "NTA, but I think it's going to be a hilarious anecdote to say \"a fart saved me from my controlling ex\".\n\nGood riddance, farts are natural, funny and an indicative that the pipes are properly working.

There's a difference between letting one slip and letting one rip, and you don't need to apologize for it.\n\nIs he courteous enough to leave the room while farting? Can he guarantee one will never happen when he's in bed (sleeping or otherwise)? \n\nOkay, if it was me, I would've said oops or excused myself, but everyone there understood that you were embarrassed, and the joke from the other girl let everyone move on without issue. Your boyfriend better get over it, or he'll be single for a long time.", "NTA\n\n I had something similar happen while sitting right in front of my boyfriend one night (.No friends were around though) and it was like a little machine gun going off of his dining room chair. This man is kind of squeemish about farts so of course, he reared back but we laughed so hard about it at the time.\n\n An \" I'm sorry \" comes out of me as I'm laughing my ass off because I'm canadian and we're sorry for everything so it's often said in default here without realizing it.

Tiny poot from sitting up to be a kind host? That no one else was bothered by?\n\nGood on you for breaking up with him.", "NTA omg girls fart, he needs to get a grip on reality.", "NTA. Plus you gotta leave.  It's a body function better let out than kept in. Ghost his ass period.", "NTA but his reaction and attitude about this gives you a good idea of what to expect from him in the future. Good call to move on!!\n\nGas happens, anybody who makes that big of a deal out of it is not someone I'd spend much time with.", "NTA. Farting is a natural human process. Literally everyone does it. Not even to mention it was accidental. No one else seemed to care. He was just rude and apparently expects you to not be a normal human.", "FAFO on his part.  \n\nNTA. Accidental toots happen and don't need profuse apologies.", "My husband and I were arguing about something pretty serious and I said \"consider this\" and ripped a pretty substantial fart. We both laughed for like 5 minutes. You want someone who gets you and accepts you.", "NTA. For me, I kinda think you did something ice-breaking rather than embarassing. After that, people can truly relax somehow. Atleast I'd think so. \n\nPeople might laugh out of it usually being delightening phenomenon rather than an embarassing one. I think you made favor to the atmosphere, ironically. \n\nHe's overthinking it.", "Imagine this dude whining on the first date to some poor soul about how his ex is his ex because she farted once\u2026", "What catches my attention is how he made mention of breaking up....then got all rage filled when you agreed.  Emotional blackmail is never a good thing", "NTA OP.  At least it wasn\u2019t a shart, which would have been far worse.", "Man fuck this guy, like his shit don't stink.

Kind of poetic.", "Apologise for an accidental fart?! Fuck that. NTA. Block him.", "NTA. \n\nHe has a very fragile ego that he thinks your accidental fart is humiliating to him. It's also ridiculous that after stating he thinks he wants to break up, he calls you selfish for agreeing. \n\nI think you should be thank to your bowels that you could test how he will respond to (slight & miniscule...) discomfort. Relationships are fun when there is no trouble on the horizon, but if a fart is enough to blow it down, you would never survive any of the real storms in life with this boy.", "Fuck that guy.\nEveryone farts, what a prick.", "NTA but you have an asshole - which is why you farted.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I think you should start to hang out with his female freind and get yourself a new man", "NTA.\n\nHe was overreacting, and then he became a full asshole when he called to berate you for breaking up with him. Good choice to break up", "Nta!! Hard core, everyone farts, people need to get over it even if it smells bad you won't die from it it's funny most times and it was an accident.

Im a gassy person, holding farts in is not possible. My partner and i laugh about it. I make sure, as much as possible, that I am either under a blanket  or walk suffiviently far enough away. If neither are possible (showering) i warn them if i am or have farted\n\nThey, in turn, cannot control their burps or hiccups  which can be quite sudden and loud, to the point kf making me jump or wince. We also laugh about those.\n\nMy lovely grandmother had a colonoscopy bag, which cannot control farts, and modelled making light of a normal bodily function for me.\n\nLife is too short to spend on people who are too proud to treat gas for the silliness it is.", "All this over a normal bodily function that everyone has? lol he\u2019s a joke \nNTA", "Lol. Imagine if you had to formally apologize to everyone. That would have been truly awkward. Let your breakup be a lesson to him.", "What! Women fart! This is the first I'v heard of this. Could you let me know if you are sure? \n\nI was taught that women never fart but they are often near a dog that does.", "You dodged a real bullet! I\u2019m sorry that guy sucked. You deserve better", "I think you made the right choice to finish it.\n\nHis behaviour at every turn is bizarre and all about him. I'm amazed he has such great friends.\n\nFarting is a normal bodily function. Shit happens. So do farts. \n\nNTA", "I am firmly in the camp of people who do not find farts amusing.

Keep being strong! \ud83d\udc4d", "Wtf no? It's a normal and healthy biological function. Sounds like he was the only one taking issue. I guess cos you're still in the early stages?

It could\u2019ve easily been solved with a quick short talk in the hall- \u201chey I was a bit uncomfortable with this, would you mind saying excuse me next time\u201d if he\u2019s really *that* uncomfortable with a natural bodily function. But Ignoring you and pouting all night is just proof he has the emotional maturity of a rotten grape. Expecting you to automatically apologize and feel ashamed for a natural bodily function is wile. Sure, saying excuse me is nice, but not doing it isn\u2019t grounds for a break up. And it\u2019s rarely needed. Most people don\u2019t care. Mh bf either tries to one-up mine, or just laughs.

I woke from my doze, mid-trumpet, and my butthole clenched so quickly and so tightly that the sound pitched up a number of octaves to a horrified mouse squeak.\n\nI didn't dare move, I was hoping he was still asleep. But then, very tentatively, he asked me \"did you just fart on my leg?\"\n\nI said yes and as I was mid-apology, he cut me off to say \"oh thank God we can fart in front of one another\" and his own fart rang out in the room. He then told me he'd been holding it in for ages and he was so uncomfortable.\n\nWe've been together 16 years and counting.", "let him loose", "the fuck is wrong w him are you dating a 7 year old?

Shaming you for normal bodily functions and making it about him when you were clearly mortified are both very bad signs.

This was the first time I was going to have a chance to really spend some time with his friends. They were all really good people and we were all having a great night. \n\nAt one stage, I offered to get everyone beers out of the fridge and when I crouched down, I accidentally let out a small fart. I was sooo embarrassed but thankfully one of his friends (female) made a joke about her farts being a lot worse than that, so it kind of broke the awkwardness and everyone laughed, and didn\u2019t think it was a big deal (thankGod)\n\nMy boyfriend, however, didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the night. He barely talked to anyone. He had a really sulky look on his face. When everyone left he asked me to leave too and said he couldn\u2019t believe that I was (a) so unmannered that I would fart in public, (b) not apologise to everyone for farting, and (c) that I didn\u2019t apologise privately to him because I humiliated him in front of his friends, and he thinks he wants to break up.  \n\nI was too stunned to argue but as I walked home I felt he was being totally ridiculous and decided I really didn\u2019t want to try and work this out. \n\nHe asked me the following day via text if I had thought about what he said, to which I responded \u2018yes, and I think I agree we should break up\u2019. He immediately called to berate me for being so selfish and an apology would have fixed everything\u2026. I don\u2019t feel the need to apologise though?!
