The rooms upstairs in the house are also rented out to 4 other people. Everyone has a lock to their bedroom. One of my roommates that just moved to the area recently found out about us sometimes getting tornado warnings around here. She's kind of freaked out about them and wanted to trade bedrooms with me. I do not want to because I love my bedroom. It's the most spacious in the house. It has it own bathroom. I don't have to worry about being too loud. It's also way more private and I have my own entrance outside.\n\nThe way it's set up in this house is there is a door inside on the first floor that opens to stairs that lead down into the basement. At the bottom of the stairs there is a small rectangular area with the locked door to my bedroom on the right. Even though the area at the bottom of the stairs/in front of my bedroom is small there is still enough room for 4 people to sit or even lay down. So my roommates would be perfectly safe there for the relatively short time of a tornado. I thought maybe she hadn't gone down there yet and didn't know about the area.\n\nShe did though and explained to me that she wanted my bedroom because I have a bathroom in there. She confided in me that she has digestive problems and sometimes needs the toilet right away or she will have an accident. She was worried about needing the toilet during a tornado warning. She said she was also embarrassed to bring up her condition, but now that I know she requested I give her a spare key to my bedroom in case of an emergency.\n\nI told her if I am home when there's a tornado and she needs to use the toilet I will of course let her, but I don't feel comfortable with anyone having access to my room when I'm not there. She brought up how I am not at home often and the chances of me being home to let her use the toilet were slim. Which is sort of true. I am gone for the majority of the day and don't get home until late at night. I also go out of town often for trips on the weekend.\n\nI suggested she purchase one of those emergency toilet buckets and keep it at the bottom of the stairs with the other emergency supplies. She was very put off my that suggestion and said it would be humiliating to have to poo in front of our roommates. I had to leave for work so we ended the conversation there. Obviously I can't talk to my roommates to get their opinions since I can't tell them about her digestive issues. So that's where I am now.", "created_utc": 1678222284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11laxrh/wibta_for_not_trading_bedrooms_with_roommate_or/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've offered a reasonable solution and it's up to her to decide if she wants to use it.

Her excuse is bogus and ridiculous.  If she's sheltering down there, she can use the emergency toilet you recommended she get and just deal.  Demanding to keep a key to your private space just on the chance that there MIGHT be a tornado warning and she MIGHT have to take shelter and she MIGHT need to use the bathroom is ridiculous.  She's being ludicrously entitled and deserved to be shut down with no further discussion of the issue.  Tell her to go handing out keys to her room to whoever wants one since she thinks that such a great idea.", "NAH I completely understand both sides here because I have similar digestive issues as her and would have the same concerns but also wouldn't feel comfortable letting someone into my space without me there.\n\nETA: Maybe she can get some Depends underwear?", "You are in the right to not want to give out the key to your bedroom.

She's gonna have to learn to be more realistic about tornadoes if she's chosen to live in tornado alley. Duh!\n\nJust explain to her how tornado watches work.

But, keep in mind that \"no\" is a complete answer and requires no additional explanation. If she keeps pressuring you about this tell tell her she is making you uncomfortable. If she continues, tell your landlord. She may or may not have some kind of gastrointestinal problem, but that is not your concern or your responsibility to fix or accommodate.

There is no need to give her access to your space.", "The only reasonable possible solution that you COULD offer (for everyone's safety) is to put a code lock on the door - the kind where you can issue individual pass codes and would alert you that someone has entered the room. Then all roommates would have emergency access to a room with a door and a bathroom in the basement for safety during tornadoes, and op would know if anyone entered the room during non emergencies. \n\nI'm not sure if it's necessary (or even how much that would cost) because I don't know about tornadoes or this house layout.
