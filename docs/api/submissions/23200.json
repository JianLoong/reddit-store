Just why? Obviously your kids need more attention, any less is unacceptable as this situation already seems unsafe.\n\nThis sounds like neglect to me, and you\u2019re bringing more children you can\u2019t take care of into the world. When it comes to your SIL it sounds like CPS should be contacted.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for refusing to let your kids stay with SIL, but you and your husband are shitty parents for failing to protect your kids and making sure they\u2019re healthy and safe. Also for getting another baby when you obviously don\u2019t even have time for the children you already have. You sound incredibly selfish and entitled.", "Can't hit E7 or E8 without a divorce and DUI!", "I\u2019d be embarrassed to tell anyone I was that nasty.", "Obviously, OP's husband doesn't seem to be pulling quite this much, but punching in numbers as an E7 with ten years of service, five members in the family, living in Kaneohe Bay, he should be pulling somewhere above 100k mark per year between base pay and BAH.\n\nNot... defending their usage, or anything else, just saying it's possible for service members to earn a decent amount (though BAH is adjusted for local cost of living, you won't make that much in a low cost of living area.)", "He\u2019s got the DUI under his belt. Doubt the divorce will happen though \ud83d\ude02", "I can't believe what I'm reading! YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND are responsible for the welfare of your children!! YOU left them with other people for a whole year, somewhere they were not well looked after, AND you're pregnant again??? This is the biggest issue, and YTA massively!! Headlice can be treated. The trauma of being forced to leave your parents while they start making new babies is not so easily dealt with.", "Would you have needed to work all that overtime to earn enough to pay for your kids if you weren\u2019t working all that overtime in the first place?\n\nI understand law enforcement and the military aren\u2019t 9-5 jobs, I know that (in some places) childcare was near impossible to find during the pandemic, and (while I don\u2019t personally understand how your SIL managed to hide that bad an infestation four times) you didn\u2019t notice anything untoward until now. \n\nIf I accept you made all these points in good faith - what I don\u2019t understand is why you are asking if YTA? You don\u2019t seem to have any doubts, you haven\u2019t accept any counterpoints as legitimate and you even appear to resent the judgements you explicitly asked for. \n\nSo why did you ask? Your response to getting answers **you** asked for suggests you\u2019re not missing anything - we are. I\u2019m not convinced you\u2019ve posted, and replied, in good faith.\n\nWhilst many of your counterpoints are fair, reasonable and justified - some aren\u2019t. You clearly made mistakes, you clearly did miss things - because things were missed. They didn\u2019t miss themselves. You are not entirely responsible but you do have responsibility. YTA for pushing back on that responsibility.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting so much hate. My brother lived with my uncle while my parents worked overseas because he didn\u2019t care for boarding school. Where they got the idea you didn\u2019t check on your kids is beyond me!", "Lol reminds me of that Futurama line, \u201cI have a night job. I need the money to buy coffee to keep awake for my night job\u201d", "Also why is the only kid she\u2019s concerned about the new one?", "Op pretty much did:\n\n<*They stayed about a year. When my husband and I finally flew in we learned quickly that the kids had severe head lice.*>\n\nSounds like they shipped them out and basically forgot about them. Also if they\u2019d of spoken to the kids in that time odds are they\u2019d have mentioned the bugs or if it was video calls (which you\u2019d expect for such a long separation) she\u2019d have noticed them scratching.\n\nYou\u2019re N-T-A for finally paying attention to your existing kids but majorly YTA for basically abandoning your three children, never checking up on them AND only really sounding like you care because you\u2019re worried your new baby will get them.", "That is the reason though. If you had taken care of your kids instead of not seeing them for an entire year, this wouldn't have happened in the first place.", "I'm sorry you shipped your kids off to live with someone else for a year? YTA", "I mean about as shitty as OP who shipped her 3 kids off for a YEAR", "Had a crazy neighbor give my kids stuffed animals that turned out to have bedbugs on them. Researched and found out Diatomaceous Earth was the best way to kill them, it sucks the moisture out of them and the eggs. Pretty inexpensive to buy, I spread it all over my kids carpet, baseboards, under the sheets on their mattresses, couch, etc... 2 weeks later, not another bite/bug. Never had an issue since, also taught them to never take any more 'gifts' again."]}
