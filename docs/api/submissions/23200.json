This is a health issue.  Those poor kids live in that condition.  Keep your kids, yourself, and home parasite free.", "NTA for wanting your home to be pest free, but before you go off on SIL find out if she\u2019s tried to get rid of them herself. Both are notoriously difficult to eradicate and she could be too ashamed to discuss it with anyone. Just suggesting diplomacy here, especially since they did provide you significant support in your time of need. Good luck with the exterminator. I\u2019d be going bonkers.", "NTA.  If they are an infestation vector, you need to keep away.  That's just common sense.", "YTA\n\n\nYou sent your kids away and are annoyed at how they were treated....\n\n\nMaybe parent your own kids?", "And he\u2019s not upset about the $1000 exterminator or replacing brand new furniture? \n\nMaybe I\u2019m being sensitive but the fact that he knew and didn\u2019t say anything is a huge red flag in my eyes. Not because of costs, but just because that is incredibly strange.", "NTA. I won't begrudge anyone who finds themselves with an infestation, because shit like that can come from anywhere and it's not really someone's fault, but failure to treat your kids when they have lice in their hair has to be some sort of abuse.\n\nMy roommate brought home bed bugs a year ago (and lied to us about it for over a week after she knew), and even though we haven't had them since September, I still struggle with anxiety, insomnia, real mental effects of dealing with them. They can fuck you up and they need to be dealt with. \n\nYour SIL may suffer from something like depression where she just can't deal with cleaning, extermination. She might not be able to afford it. But that doesn't mean you have to let your kids get dragged into it too.", "Definitely NTA!", "NTA. But I would try to speak to your husband's family kindly, especially given the help they have provided you with child care. This is potentially a really embarrassing thing for them, and I would be inclined to offer them help first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yikes!", "Nta, your sil and mil are disgusting and her kids could be taken away by CPS if you were to call them. How shitty of a mother is she that she\u2019s fine w her kids and herself living like that? She obviously neglects her home and her children.", "The kicker is she has children of her own living like this. They are much older than mine but still. I think I\u2019m more angry that everyone but me and my husband knew she had the bed bugs and didn\u2019t tell me. The sister didn\u2019t mention it nor did his mother. I learned after that my MIL knew and intentionally hid it so we could take SIL kids for a week.", "Yes of course. I try to stay away from conflict so I asked him to talk to his sister. Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t see issue with this. I know I\u2019ve left out a lot of information and commenters are probably asking why I allowed her to take my kids in the first place. She did a great job at hiding the infestations when I came to visit and it wasn\u2019t until we physically moved back here that I was able to see the severity of her living conditions. I couldn\u2019t tell her how to live her life and I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve only now put my foot down in refusing contact (at least temporarily) because her choices are directly impacting the way I live.", "Finally someone said it. OP put her kids in this situation. She left them for a whole year with so little contact that she didn't even know how they were. Of course SIL is an AH for doing nothing about lice and bed bugs but OP (and her husband) is ultimatelty responsible for her own children and maling sure they are treated well.", "I can see why you would view me as that. However that isn\u2019t even the reason for me making this post. Did you actually read the post in its entirety?", "No he was not aware but the rest of his family was.", "Yes you are right. I\u2019ve offered help but she says she doesn\u2019t need it. Despite all of this I will always be grateful for her taking our children in. I flew to see them four times (everytime I had enough leave saved from work), sent her over $50k to support the kids, and paid off her car loan. But due to their culture, it isn\u2019t appropriate or better yet, frowned upon, if I approached her about my feelings on the matter. If I expressed me being upset that we have to throw away furniture, spend upwards of $1000 for an exterminator, and that my children have bites all over them, I would be the bad person.", "That is what I meant by those poor kids, the SIL's children.  It sucks for yours too because now you have an infestation starting because of watching her kids.  If SIL won't take care of the infestation problem, then she can deal with no one wanting to come over, have her or the kids over, etc.  I wouldn't let anyone who visits her come over either because then they are potentially carrying that sh\\*t over.  Nope, nope nope.", "Wow what kind of family is this?!!?!    \n\nHow much did you know about them before you got married and then sent your kids to live there?!     You weren\u2019t able to inspect the space at all, and they were clearly neglected for a whole year.    Who knows what else took place.", "Yes.\n\n\nYou sent them to your relatives and are now annoyed about how those relatives treated them......\n\n\nWhy has it taken you this long to realise there is an issue?", "What kind of culture is this, that is calmly living with vermin and bloodsucking insects in their own home?!     Wtf.", "I\u2019ve been married for almost 8 years now. I do know that recent events have changed his family\u2019s dynamic A LOT. I truly thought my children were being taken care of. This is purely a mistake on my part. That\u2019s why I held my tongue when I finally moved and learned of the head lice. But after being here a year and having bed bugs in my home it\u2019s hard to continue keeping this to myself.", "The culture isn\u2019t supportive of confrontation. Very traditional. However the way she chooses to live isn\u2019t culture related. I believe it is a mix of depression and a little bit of pure laziness.", "I guess NTA for not wanting your kids there now, but you really lost me at sending your kids away for a YEAR.  And apparently not like checking on them? Or talking to them so they\u2019d tell you? Why are you having more kids if you can\u2019t care for the ones you already have.  The whole thing makes me sad for your kids.", "ESH", "ESH. Does his sister even have the money to get the treatment to get rid of all these bugs done? \n\nAnd for gods sake, or at least the sake of the children, stop having kids you obviously can\u2019t afford.", "NTA.  That is absolutely disgusting.  What kind of filth are they living in that they have so many bugs?  And then to allow her kids to bring it into your home.  IDK why your husband isn't taking this more seriously.  Does he just not get it?   You're not talking shit about her, you're showing your husband that she's bringing bugs into your home.  WTF is the matter with him?", "NTA- hold your boundaries. Hold them strong.", "I am dumbfounded that you sent your kids to a relative for a year because you couldn't afford childcare and have a fourth one on.the way.

On this, alone, you're NTA, OP. \n\nHad with them in my old apartment building for my last eight months there.  Caused a few physical health problems and, prior to learning I had them, a complete nervous breakdown because I was having panic attacks \"for no reason\" (allergy -> adrenaline -> body thinks it's dying) and not sleeping or eating for *weeks* before I finally detected the little bastards.\n\nFive months removed from that hell, I'm still covered in bite and hive scars, and I still jump and get upset by every dark fuzzy or speck of dirt I find.  It can absolutely have a longterm impact. \n\nYou've gotta protect your home and your family, OP.", "You can disrespect \"culture\" when someone's been poisoning your children and is continuing to poison your niblings.", "You sent her 50k in.a year, and you can not afford childcare?", "She said childcare was hard to find, not hard to afford.", "Being a military family is hard enough with having to move every four years or more.  It sucks when you hand your kids over to family thinking they will be well cared for...because it's family, only to find out that things are not on the up and up.  I would have been questioning my kids to find out what all else I may have missed because you can't trust the adults around them.  \n\nIf you had a heads up about their pest problems, then you would have been ready to say no to the kids staying or waiting outside to meet them.  That way you could properly attempt to delouse and debug, whatever needed to be done (including not bringing in the clothes because those have to be bombed and cleaned).\n\nIt sucks for your brother's nieces/nephews."]}
