My dad\u2019s room is far enough so he only hears the babies when theye\u2019re screaming. He refuses to buy a babymonitor so the result is that I\u2019m up half of the time. Today he asked me how I slept and I said I didn\u2019t sleep well and I said I wasn\u2019t his personal baby monitor. He completly lost it when I said this.

It seems like you've found the perfect Christmas gift for your siblings: a baby monitor.", "NTA\n\nThis is a classic example of: Don't ask a question if you don't want to hear the answer. Sure, you could have been more diplomatic about it, but when people are sleep-deprived they tend to be short-tempered.", "Certainly NTA, but some info is missing. It seems he's the only parent in the household? Then he needs to atually parent. Infants need constant care and supervision. Being far enough that he can't even notice if anything is wrong with them is simply dangerous. They are clearly not your responsibility, even if it's nice/common etc. for a family member to help out. Expecting you to suck up all night duties is not that. Buy him a baby monitor, or a pair of noise cancelling headphones or earplugs for yourselves. Or start exploring your options to live somewhere else.", "NTA sounds like it\u2019s true and he knows it.", "Definitely NTA here. I\u2019d recommend buying yourself some ear plugs to help you rest and maybe gifting your dad/siblings a baby monitor for Xmas.", "NTA. He's a parent, not you.", "NTA. Where is the mom?", "NTA. Swap rooms with your dad and buy him a monitor for Christmas", "NTA do you have family you can go live with or family friends until after  your finals are over. In the meantime cant you get a sleeping bag and go sleep elsewhere in the house and buy some ear plugs too.", "NTA. Have you considered buying some good quality, sleeping earplugs?", "NAH -- your dad was probably really hurt by the suggestion that he only considers you as a baby monitor when he expressing some caring -- by asking how you slept -- so his reaction is understandable. And your reaction is understandable considering how much sleep you're missing.  So I hope this convinces him that he needs to get a baby monitor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
