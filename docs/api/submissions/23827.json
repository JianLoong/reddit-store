He claimed she just bolted away from him in the park, into some bushes and he could not find her.\n\nOur dog is quite small, a mini poodle mix and almost 13 years old, she is still active but it is really unlike her to run away from us and I was suspicious but chose to believe my husband and me and my daughter were in grief but did not want to blame him.\n\nWhen we came back home, he seemed surprisingly ok unlike us. Ever since the pandemic, my husband started working from home and he has always been annoyed at how much attention we gave Ellie and hated how Ellie begged to sit on our laps and his while he worked.\n\nA few days later we got a call from an animal rescue in a neighboring state quite far from us that she had been found. I picked the phone and it was on our landline which we almost never use these days but was the contact on the microchip.\n\nI told my husband and he just said \"that is great, I am so happy\" but it felt kind of blunt and insincere. I said it is strange that she got so far and he responded that someone must have stolen her and then abandoned her. This made little sense to me as to why that would happen.\n\nWhen he was out drinking with his buddies, I copied the videos from his dashcam for the days I was away and saw that he had indeed taken Ellie far out of state, and clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her.\n\nI was livid and confronted him and he just stupidly muttered how he dropped her there so she could find a farm and have a better life and then the next day got really angry at me for viewing his dashcam and called me an my daughter AHs.", "created_utc": 1691116758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hnt2x/aita_for_checking_my_husbands_dashcam_footage_on/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep your dog and daughter and leave the husband in another state to find another family he'd have a better life with.", "Wow...NTA. You had a gut feeling and were absolutely right. This is horrible. What your husband did is SICK and cruel. He left an innocent animal to die. Obviously what you do now is up to you. But if it were me, I would never be able to trust him again. The entire relationship would be ruined.\n\nHe needs to seek therapy if he is so insecure that he is jealous of a dog. Pathetic excuse for a man.", "Nta it's animal cruelty and if he called your 7 y/o an ah you need to start filing for divorce", "NTA \n\nI personally would straight up divorce him\u2026 my dogs are my family.\nThen he turns around and gets mad and calls you names. That\u2019s the same tactic that cheaters use when their significant other finds something. Trying the ol\u2019 uno reverso on you.", "Leave his ass immediately. He abandons a 13 year old dog in a field to fend for itself? Unforgivable.", "NTA. This is a dealbreaker for me. I would never look at him the same way again. Nor would I trust him.", "NTA. Run.\n\nReally, OP, I don\u2019t know what else to say. He drove **out of state** to dump your senior dog. Next time, he\u2019s going to hit her with his car. He called you **and your seven-year-old daughter** assholes.\n\nIf your dog is still in the home with you, move her to a friend or family\u2019s. Like, tonight.", "NTA, he abandoned a family member. My dad did this shit to us as a kid with one of our dogs he didn't like and I still haven't forgiven him.\n\n\nI hope he realizes how fucked up this was.\n\nBTW my dad was also seeing prostitutes behind my mother's back at the same time but we didnt find out for 10ish years.  All I'll say is that someone with thar little empathy and willingness to lie might be doing more behind your back than you realize.", "NTA, keep a copy of the footage as evidence", "NTA. What a horrible action, very scary stuff to be so abusive and callous toward a living creature, and then the elaborate lies. You picked up on signs of deception and then confirmed with evidence. Even if he were innocent, driving records hardly deserve as much privacy as phone records. Absolutely NTA. Husband is scary.", "Dude, damn, that\u2019s monstrous. If he can do that, what else is he capable of. Yikes. NTA at all.", "yeah... a partner who's that jealous of the affection a pet gets?\n\nhope you and your daughter can get out safely. NTA", "NTA. Fuck your husband.", "Glad to see in the comments you\u2019re getting a lawyer. Make sure you have copies of that video saved in multiple places. What an awful thing to do to a dog. And you. And your daughter.\n\nNTA. Obviously.", "That\u2019s called gaslighting.  He\u2019s not the asshole for deliberately abandoning the family pet behind your back. You\u2019re the asshole for catching him, how dare you \ud83d\ude44", "He brought it upon himself.  If he feels that way about a dog, imagine what he might feel about you or your daughter.  Up to you what to do from here.  NTA.", "NTA, keep copies of that footage, file for divorce. What a nightmare, I\u2019m so sorry.", " NTA but are you and your daughter safe?", "NTA he lied about your dog. He throws away your dog without your consent first.", "NTA. Your husband did something immensely cruel and it sounds like he planned it -- poorly-- and now he's deflecting by calling you and your daughter (seriously,  your daughter?) AHs.\n\nMy ex brother-in-law did that to my dog over 40 years ago. I haven't forgiven him yet.", "NTA, good for you,", "Divorce.\nHe is broken beyond repair.\n\nYour ONLY other choice is to rehome your dog, never getting another pet and pray to god he doesn't become jealous of the attention you give your child.\n\nAlso  keep the footage forever. Backup too.\nRewatch now and then so he never can lull you with words again.", "He called a 7 year old an ah? What\u2019s she got to do with any of this? Is she his kid? Cuz if not, you should probably rethink your relationship. I call my kids ahs\u2026but not in the sense that they actually ARE\u2026they just do ah things sometimes\u2026cuz they\u2019re feral.

I don\u2019t even understand how someone could do this to there own dog that has been in the family for years. He has no heart.", "Super NTA, this would be a divorcable offense to me.", "NTA. This is divorce territory.", "NTA. You clearly had reason to suspect he committed a crime.\n\nWell, that's everyone's excuse for spying, so let me go a little further.\n\nI'm not troubled by the invasion of personal privacy because I think that as a spouse, you have at least some communal access to the use of certain property that is technically owned or used by the other spouse, like a car. So among the things that you would be naturally inclined to check and have access to, the dashcam footage would be one of them. Others might disagree.", "Your husband is worse than an AH", "OP this really crosses a huge boundary, and I personally would have to wonder if I could ever trust a partner ever gain to do something like that with anything they said if ever something like that ever happened.  I don't know how he could be so nonchalant about that, especially because he called you out on checking his dashcam video and calling you both AHs.  He's definitely deleting his dashcam video in the future if he ever tries to hide anything in the future while driving his car.  It also begs the question what else has he been potentially hiding from you.", "NTA. Assholery is relative. Checking the dashcam footage was not a good thing to do, but it pales in comparisom to abandoning a family member out-of-state.", "As my daughter would say, When something is Suss, you gotta investigate. NTA", "Drop him where/how he dropped the dog. NTA", "YTA if you stay with this monster! How DISGUSTING your husband's actions were.  How can you ever trust him again?", "NTA. If this story is even true, then it's perfectly obvious who the asshole is. And who records themselves doing something like that? He's either an idiot, or he wanted to be caught.", "NTA.   A bit of a risky move, because if nothing was on the footage, YWBTA.  But, since it proved your suspicions, your husband is a TA and a turd for abusing an animal like that.", "NTA your husband is a jerk", "NTA, your husband is a massive one though. If I were you, I don't think I will ever trust him again when he can do easily abandon family member like that", "The fact that he called his seven year old daughter an asshole in this situation is reason enough alone for me to say NTA", "Meh it was a bit assholeish to check his dashcam, invasion of privacy and all that, but because it turns out you were totally justified in looking at it as he betrayed you and your daughter\u2019s trust I dub thee NTA. Also I would start looking at divorce lawyers. This is a terrible thing to do especially to a child.", "Well, if you searched his dash cam video and found nothing,  you would be TA. But if you invade someone's privacy and find something bad, you're not TA.\n\nFunny how this works", "You are NTA, but I have to wonder... Did he do this because he felt unheard by you?   \n\n\nI'm not saying his actions were justified, your dog was entirely innocent and he shouldn't have left her like that, but I wonder if there's more to the story on why he did what he did.", "Lol fake.

I suggest keeping the dog and re-homing the husband.", "Exactly, it\u2019s not his personal dash cam.  She wasn\u2019t invading his privacy or spying, she was investigating her missing dog.", "Does \"stuff\" include the dog? or is it just you, him, and the 7 yo?   \n\n\nI ask because it sounds like he took his anger out on the dog because he might feel the dog is responsible for him not getting enough of you and your daughter. It could also be why he prefers to hang with his buddies if that's the case, his buddies will give him the undivided time he doesn't feel he gets from you.   \n\n\nOf course, this is just my own speculation on the situation. I'm sorry that happened to your dog, though, I would've probably done worst if my spouse had done that to my cat.", "With scorpions.", "These are great questions.\n\nHe is sloppy because he has gotten away with lots of things.\n\nI would never suggest checking bank account statements, but...
