A bit of a risky move, because if nothing was on the footage, YWBTA.

Did he do this because he felt unheard by you?   \n\n\nI'm not saying his actions were justified, your dog was entirely innocent and he shouldn't have left her like that, but I wonder if there's more to the story on why he did what he did.", "Lol fake.
