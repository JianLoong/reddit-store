You didn't want your girlfriend of 1 year to move in with you, but you CHOSE to have her move in.

If you didn't want to, you could have said no and dealt with the consequences or broken up with her. \n\nYou said, \"yes, for now\" but you haven't clarified what that even means. Did you say \"yes you can move in\" or \"yes you can stay with me while you find another place?\" The girlfriend is operating under the assumption you're both living together and are a team and this is a permanent residence. If that's how you've made it seem to her, YTA for getting a dog and not making that decision as a team. \n\nIn another comment you talk about how you find your girlfriend aggressive with wants and how she wants to be married in a few years and you don't want to. What are you going to do next- roll over, propose to her, and then insist it's a marriage \"for now\" situation and you shouldn't have to ask her to buy a new car? \n\nIf you don't want her to live with her, then dump her. If she wants to get married in a few years and you don't, then dump her. If you want the dog and she doesn't, then dump her. You're literally incompatible and stop pretending you've somehow fell into this living arrangement through no decisions of your own.", "Omigod.  Good try, but she did not hold you down and remove the house key from your pocket.  You are not a helpless victim who was forced to let her move in.  You are a full participant in your own decisions.\n\nOf course YTA--both for blaming her for moving in and for getting a dog she doesn't want.

You know she's living with you, even if it's only been a month and she hasn't paid rent yet. You know it's not just a situation where she spent the night and never left. This is where she lives.

It\u2019s kinda shitty that she\u2019s willing to break up with you over a dog. Says a lot about a person", "YTA. Your reservations about letting her move in a month ago are not relevant. You have a room mate, regardless of whether it is your girlfriend, or a friend, or a parent. In your case, your girlfriend.

Really ESH, but I think you get the brunt of the responsibility. GF may have pushed you, but you agreed to let her live with you.

Agreeing has far reaching ramifications. As you are finding out.\n\nI also think it might be possible you knew she wouldn't be stoked about this which might prompt her to move out. Which is pretty passive aggressive. Always just be aggressive aggressive! Saves time and potential confusion! :D\n\nbut She's TA for pressuring you into letting her move in, failing to contribute on rent, and throwing down an ultimatum. My rule on these is I will 100% always take someone up on their offer to break up, if they think that behavior is acceptable.", "ESH.", "YTA for the dog issue.  You dont bring a pet into a relationship without talking to your partner.  The fact you didn't even stop to think to do that shows you aren't even close to being ready to have someone live with you.  \n\nHer reaction , and her not paying for anything isn't a good sign. Someone needs rehoming here and I dont think its the one with four legs.  If she is pressuring marriage with a set time, that isnt the way things goes.", "YTA.

Let\u2019s see how this goes shall we\u2026\n\nChanged to ESH.\n\nAlright. This relationship screams unhealthy. You don\u2019t say how long you\u2019ve been in the relationship, but in any case the communication just isn\u2019t there.\n\nYou are not setting proper boundaries, and the ones you are she is walking all over. (Why she is the AH) She is clearly at the point where she is thinking as an \u201cus\u201d and you are still at the \u201cI\u201d. That requires a conversation. I think moving in was likely a terrible decision before that conversation has happened. Icing in with a partner out of conviniese is almost always a bad idea (I see you COVID R-ships). You want to move in with someone because you see a future there and want to test out how you work together.\n\nHere is where you were in the wrong. If you see this person in your life for more than the next couple months (aka if you are serious about this relationship in any way) this should have been discussed. If you continue to be with her, this decision impacts her life as well. As you move forward, many decisions need to be centred around the dog. Travel? Need to board it or find a baby sitter. Want to go out for dinner with friends after work? Can\u2019t someone needs to be home to let the dog out. Want to get drunk and stay over at a friends? Impossible. These make huge differences, especially to a early twenties life. \n\nThis also tells her that you don\u2019t value her in the relationship at all. You have made a decision that she hopes will impact her (that she will be around long enough that it will impact her) without any input. At the end of the day, it is your life, your appartment and your say. But put yourself in her shoes. What if she made a decision today that would highly affect your life without your input? Would you not be seriously considering breaking up? Would you not feel worthless in the eyes of your partner? Would you not feel pretty alone?\n\nTime to take a serious look at what you want. If it\u2019s not her, let her go find someone that wants what she wants. If it is, have a serious sit down conversation about boundaries and respect in the relationship, and how you want this to play out.\n\nIf your decision in the latter, may I suggest an apology and some flowers? It will go a long way. Make her feel seen and heard and I suspect she will embrace the dog.\n\nEdit- in re reading post I see he says it\u2019s been about a year. Sorry to have missed this. Everything still stands.", "YTA - What if she adopted a child without discussing it with you?\n\nPerhaps you should establish your financial decisions before doing stuff like this", "YTA you brought a pet into a shared space - you have to discuss such things and ideally, she should be with you meeting the dog too. The fact you didn\u2019t is just a sign you\u2019re still too immature for relationships. Her creating the ultimatum is also immature.

You don\u2019t even necessarily need to ask for permission, but a little communication probably would have gone a long way here.

Regardless she might feel like you don\u2019t care about her thoughts or feelings.", "INFO\n\nYou mentioned that she has known that you wanted to get a Husky for as long as you have been dating. A year. So she must have been fine with you getting a dog then right? Her reaction indicates that maybe she was not ok with it and did not communicate that or you disregarded it.\n\nThe INFO I really need is key. Has she ever expressed disapproval at the knowledge that you want to get a dog at any time for the past year? Has she expressed approval for it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she has expressed approval or not indicated disapproval then:\n\nNTA. Honestly this is a girlfriend who was desperate to get out of a difficult situation and regardless she is not in a position to be telling you what to do whatsoever. She can make suggestions but unless she has a very good reason for not wanting to live with a dog (like deathly allergic) then she should not be trying to control your life.\n\nIf she didn't tell you one way or another then she is a terrible communicator and the blame still lies with her.\n\nHonestly I would evaluate why she is trying to control your life like that and if that is something you want to deal with long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she has expressed disapproval and was not happy about your desire to get a dog then:\n\nESH. If you knew she was not ok with it and did it anyway that is a pretty blatant disregard for her feelings and I don't blame her for reacting the way she did. You should be communicating better about major responsibilities and things you KNOW will cause an issue like that. On the flip side if she just does not like dogs then she is being pretty controlling and not willing to work together and compromise.

Say my roommates know that.\n\nAh ah ah...you're substituting a dangerous animal for a dog. And you're also ignoring the fact that he's been actively looking for a dog the whole time they've been together.\n\nIt's a nice strawman, though! \n\n> The important part is the communication\n\nI mean, as I said, he *could* have told her that he finally found his dog. \n\nJust like she *could* have told him that it was a deal-breaker for her from the get-go.\n\nI don't know why you don't at least think the freeloading \"me or the dog\" girlfriend is also an AH in this situation, but hey. It's your opinion.\n\nI'll just leave it at that.", "> If you read the sentences before and after you quoted you'll see that I asked him to clarify if the \"yes, for now\" was said to his girlfriend or something he's saying to us. I also said \"if that's how you made it seem to her.\" \n\nYou really think that's how you presented it? lol\n\nYou said:\n\n> You said, \"yes, for now\" but you haven't clarified what that even means.\n\nI think we all know what \"for now\" means. If not, I can help you out: It means that it's temporary or on a trial basis.\n\nYou then say:\n\n> The girlfriend is operating under the assumption you're both living together and are a team and this is a permanent residence.\n\nI don't see any uncertainty in that statement, do you?\n\n>  If you live with someone part of being a good roommate is checking in on big decisions, especially if that roommate is supposed to be your partner. \n\nBut she's known that he's been looking for a dog since they first got together.\n\nWhy didn't she tell him this was a deal-breaker for her?\n\nIf I were a betting man, I'd say it's because she thought she would be able to convince him not to get one.\n\nOP *could* have let her know he'd found his dog...but she also *could* have let him know that it was a deal-breaker for her.\n\nBetter yet, she *could* have been happy for him!\n\nAnyway, we clearly disagree, so I'll just leave it at that.", "Honestly, I'd feel so guilty about taking the dog back, and she (the dog) has really grown on me. \n\nThe shelter is also a kill-shelter, and while I hope the husky would get adopted quickly, I don't know if I could forgive myself if they end up putting her down", "Yeah I'm not really sure. She grew up with a big dog (golden retriever) and she's pretty friendly with it whenever she goes back home. \n\nShe does tend to throw these ultimatums at me. Like with the moving in situation, she basically framed it as like \"if you don't let me move in and help me get away from this situation, then you don't really love me and we should break up\"", "Why would she expect to live there long term? OP didn't want her to move in and told her she can stay \"for now\". \n\nIf you were in this situation where someone didn't want to live with you and because you're desperate they offer their place \"for now\" would you expect to be there long term?", "It's started off as just helping her get out of a bad situation, and I didn't think much more of it. I wanted things to move a bit slower, but I felt bad for her living situation. In my mind, it was definitely temporary, like helping out a friend. But I know she took it much more seriously.\n\nWe said that we could think of it as kind of a trial period to see if it works out. We haven't talked about paying rent yet. Her moving in was honestly a very hard decision in the first place, and she basically said \"let me move in, or we break up\". I didn't want to lose her, so I let her move in even though I still don't think we're there yet.", "> All he needed to do was call her and say, Hey found my dog, its coming home with me today.\n\nAnd I mean, all she needed to do was say \"I really want to move in with you, but I know you really want a dog. That's not going to work for me, so how firm are you on that?\"\n\nI also seriously doubt that a call would have changed her reaction, TBH. \n\nBut you're right: OP could have communicated better. That said, any good partner would have been happy for him that he finally found his puppy, so...", "Copy/pasting this response to someone else asking the same question:\n\n>If she's signed some sort of agreement to pay rent monthly, then yes, she should get a say. That's not what I got out of OP's post though. The post is written in a way that indicates, to me, that she's staying for free temporarily, not a permanent living situation with her as a tenant.", "Like I said to the other person: Giving her a heads-up would have been nice, sure. Not giving her a heads-up doesn't move the needle to AH territory though.", "One of my security staff at work is 6\u20196 and built like a wall.  He\u2019s a really, really nice teddy bear of a man.\n\nHe and his wife have 2 teacup sized dachshunds.  He can hold one in his hand.  They\u2019re adorable!  Full dachshund personality in an even smaller package.\n\nAnd far less labor intensive than any of my parents dogs have been.  They had rescued St Bernards for a decade and a half...", "\u201cyou're substituting a dangerous animal for a dog\u201d\n\nWhy on earth do you think a sixteen pound eight foot boa with 1/4 inch long teeth is more dangerous than a fifty odd pound high energy dog?\n\nMy 8 ft boa couldn\u2019t actually injure me unless I was comatose from drugs and he decided I was a giant rat and just happened to wrap my neck.  Edit - and it lives in an enclosure separate from people 95% of the time, so that\u2019s even more unlikely.\n\nHeck, if I ever get bitten I most likely wouldn\u2019t even need medical care unless he whacked his teeth into my eye somehow.  A little soap and water and neosporin plus a couple days making sure I don\u2019t have a tooth broken off under the skin.\n\nOne of my neighbors lost a forty pound husky mix that I ran across outside my house.  That dog went jumping for my Face from the ground multiple times to rip off my mask, knocked me over three times, and left welts all up my arms from claws.  And it was just bouncing around being playful.\n\nEvery dog my family has owned would have likely required stitches and potentially digit reattachment for an actual bite, and is far more dangerous than a boa.  Collie, border collie, St Bernards, goldendoodle, large mystery mutt.\n\nHeck, any of the St Bernards especially could have landed me in urgent care just by pulling a bit on a walk when we were at a curb or on a hill on an icy patch.  They did get me some impressive bruises and scrapes.\n\nPeople with dogs seem to forget that about 40 people in the US die every year from dog attacks, and around 800k more end up needing medical treatment for dog induced injuries.", "I mean there's no uncertainty in the statement because that IS how she's operating. Whether or not that belief is accurate was uncertain. Which is why I said \"if you have given her that impression.\" \n\nI think she's an asshole for reasons outside this question and agree with you on how she could have behaved better- but for me at the end of the day you should tell someone you're bringing home a large dog that day. And OP has said on a comment he purposely did not tell her because he knew she would say no. \n\nWe're fine to agree to disagree tho and I respect your opinion :)", "Your gf knows you\u2019ve been actively searching for a husky so the time for her to bring up not wanting a dog would have been when the 2 of you were talking about it. I\u2019m a huge animal lover so unless you are in love with this woman and see a long future with her I\u2019d keep the dog. But if you did keep gf instead of the dog I think you\u2019d always resent her.", "Get out of this relationship, those ultimatums are only going to get worse", "emotionial blackmail. I wouldnt even think about what to do. Tell her you choose the dog. Than break up. She wont break up. She just wants to control You", "manipulation tactic.", "Dude get out. That so manipulative wtf. What's next she's going to force you into marriage before you're comfortable? Force you to be a father before you're ready? Ultimatums are not okay.", "Oh sweetie, girlie needs to go! She's stomping all over you, this will be your future if stay with her.", "She has it in her head she's there for the long term. She doesn't think she's a guest.", "In that case, I'd shift it to a very light ESH/NTA, but also, you probably still should have said something, but her reaction makes sense from her perspective. However, her perspective and yours are incompatible because you two seem to have a communication problem. You two need to be on the same page with your living situation first, and then this problem is secondary.", "While I agree with a gentle YTA on the dog adopting question - if her go-to move is \"do what I want or we break up,\" I would think very carefully about your relationship. She may not consciously be using you per se, and there are definitely times when an ultimatum (or setting a firm limit) is appropriate, but in a healthy relationship it shouldn't be the default approach.\n\n(This is me seeing a pattern in the whopping two situations I know about your girlfriend, and both on substantive issues rather than petty ones, so if I'm overthinking it please ignore me.)\n\nBut it sounds like your goals for your current lives might not be compatible anyway \\^\\^", "So her solution to every problem is do what she wants or break up? \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "But her reaction isnt what the OP is asking about though.  Is she an AH , yup, and they shouldnt be together but him not even doing the smallest effort to let her know about the dog being adopted makes him an AH in this situation.", "She hasn't paid rent bc we agreed this is kind of a trial period. Not sure what the plans for next month are yet", "Does for me. It\u2019s really disrespectful and rude.", "I cannot even imagine the cuteness overload of a perpetual doxie puppy!!!! I\u2019m sure they boss him around like no one\u2019s business.", "> But her reaction isnt what the OP is asking about though.\n\nSo then it's ESH.\n\n> but him not even doing the smallest effort to let her know about the dog being adopted makes him an AH in this situation.\n\nKnow what I'd do if I came home to find out that my partner got her dream dog--one that I knew she'd been looking for for over a year--while I was at work?\n\nI'd be happy for her.", "IMO she should still be paying rent...it's a trial period living with you, not living in general. She's still using utilities, etc.", "You didn't want to move in together in the first place and sabotaged it during the trial period. Next time, use your words like a big boy.", "If there's a next month after her behaviour and that ultimatum, then you have bigger issues than the dog. There are better women out there who would love your dog as much as they love you.", "Oh definitely.", "Yeah it's not the entitled GF who basically wore him down with a sob story into a yes when he was clearly in the no category. His choice if he was on the fence (I wouldn't have allowed it but not my circus and all that) but she's pushing him off of it into the \"no\" category. She should rent her own place if she doesn't want a dog, like a big girl. Dude has been up front and clear about his plans, she shoehorned her way into a place she thought she could control and now that she can't, she's pitching a fit.\n\nOP, keep the dog and dump the GF. You'll be happier in the long run."]}
