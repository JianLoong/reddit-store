I think most people are seeing this through a Western lens and do not grasp the nuance of this situation. Of course, it sucked to leave your GF at the park in such a state, there is no getting around that.  I completely understand the need to be alone sometimes, and this is coming from someone who tends to be fairly extroverted. I don't think that you fully grasp the give and take involved with being in a relationship.  You would greatly benefit from therapy, as you don't seem to have any coping mechanisms to prevent this from happening in the future. There are situations, like this one where shutting down shouldn't have been an option.\n\nAs an American, I am no expert on Japanese culture or societal expectations, but I know that they are way different than what anyone on this side of the pond would be accustomed to.

I understand I\u2019m the AH for the whole park thing but she\u2019s still upset that I want  to be alone this week", "So you're either at work, tired from work, or at the doctor.\n\nI dunno man... You don't seem to have time for a girlfriend. Maybe it's best to just break up with her then. A girlfriend is a partner, not someone who you go out with at your convenience.", "Wow. You have so many excuses not to spend time with her, and you didn\u2019t even tell her in person why you were leaving because you \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d YTA. Break up with her. You don\u2019t care about her.", "Having a partner is about fitting them into your life and making them a priority. If you cannot maintain your partner, your health, your job, and your volunteer work, something has to go. Your action showed that your girlfriend is lowest on the totem pole. That is unfair to her and highly insulting. \n\nHere\u2019s what you should\u2019ve done- \nOption one: suck it up and hung out with her. \nOption two: said \u201cI\u2019m suddenly in a lot of pain and need to go to the doctor RIGHT NOW, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ll text/call you to schedule another date or schedule one right now\u201d and then immediately went to the doctor \nOption three: prior to the date, contacted her and advised you were not feeling well. \n\nFeeling ill or injured is not a reason to leave your girlfriend mid-date without a proper excuse. You lied and she knew.", "Yes. You should have stayed with her, listened to her, and loved her. Forget your neck, you can go to the doc for that. She can\u2019t go to the doc for what she\u2019s going through. If your first instinct is to bail, maybe you should do some soul searching.", "Or you could have offered to hang out with her at your place where you could rest your neck.", "Just\u2026think about how you would want to be treated. Then do that", "Yes, you should have. She was wanting support from you and you left her alone at a very vulnerable point when she needed you. Your neck being sore sucks, but it\u2019s not a good enough excuse to abandon her.", "Not if you\u2019re dating her and she needs help, no", "Sure, but if someone comes to you in a middle of a p\u00e1nico attack, they see you as a safe place. Your actions, on the other hand, are showing that you're the exact opposite.", "Dude you need to schedule with a psychologist, there is something that is not working here. Either you are in the spectrum or a narcissist. Either way you have to know it and get better with other people.", "Talking with her \u201cfor a couple minutes\u201d or texting isn\u2019t as supportive as being there. And you don\u2019t want to be alone, you have plans with friends. Break up with her. You don\u2019t care about her.", "Why did you come to AITA, and then just argue with everyone that disagrees you and calls you the AH? YTA btw, it doesn't sound like your girlfriend is important to you at all, why would you leave someone you care about crying at the park, sorry what?", "That assumes you prioritize her at other times, but as you describe, you *never* prioritize her. Your neck hurts, you\u2019re stressed, you want to be alone, you don\u2019t feel like explaining things to her, she\u2019s hard to talk to, you have plans with friends, you have to work, you have to volunteer, you didn\u2019t expect her to come over\u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be with her. Just admit it. Break up with her. YTA because you keep her around somehow, but you don\u2019t ever prioritize her.", "Are you respecting her needs at all? It seems like it\u2019s all about you", "You didn\u2019t respect the plans you made with HER.", "Shouldn\u2019t you respect her need for support and the plans you made with her?", "Yeah and in another post from a year ago they say they can't  be a good boyfriend becausetheyre too busy with friends on spring break to talk to their gf.", "Your girlfriend is having an anxiety attack and that\u2019s what\u2019s more important to you?", "Seriously, break up with her.", "You are failing to understand that \u201cnext week\u201d, phoning or texting is *not the same* as being present when you promised you would be. You said you would dedicate a day to her only to flake. \n\nDo you even like her? You\u2019re making every excuse to not be around her and be dismissive of everyone calling you out for your rude behaviour.", "Wow so kind", "Well don\u2019t be surprised when she doesn\u2019t want to see you next week", "You ditched her mid-date but won\u2019t reschedule with your friends to make time with her whilst she needs some support?\n\nI think you are very young and I want to try and offer help, like I would to my teenage sons.\n\n1. You do not have to fix your GF\u2019s problems. Listening to her is enough, don\u2019t let them stress you out. Whilst it sounds like you have a medical problem with your neck, it may have worsened whilst you were with her because you were overwhelmed and a little stressed out by her problems. (I have arthritis in my cervical spine so understand neck pain is horrible - I also know when I am stressed it is going to be exacerbated.)\n\n2. Part of being in a relationship is being there for your partner when they need you, even if it may feel like an inconvenience. And, yes, it is perfectly acceptable for your GF to turn up to see you because she wants emotional support without an appointment. She is not going to be able to plan anxiety attacks around your schedule.\n\n3. Leaving someone crying in the park, GF or otherwise, is not good behavior. I wouldn\u2019t leave a stranger crying in the park if they needed me to sit with them. \n\n4. You are aware she hadn\u2019t eaten - get her some food. You may feel incapable of helping her with her emotional needs but you could have done something practical that showed you cared. \n\n5. By finding a slot where you could schedule your GF in a week later feels dismissive. You were able to walk out on a date because you felt that you needed to but you are unable to reschedule seeing friends because she needs you to? This behavior tells your GF that she is far down on your list of priorities and is very hurtful.\n\nPlease, if you are not ready to be a caring supportive partner and prioritize your GF\u2019s needs, even over your own on occasion, do not be in a relationship. It\u2019s ok not to be. It\u2019s ok to have casual dates but be very clear from the outset that you are incapable of offering more. That way the pressure to provide what you feel you cannot is taken off you and it doesn\u2019t lead anyone else on.\n\nGood luck and I do hope you get your neck sorted soon.", "Sooooo\u2026 what? You clearly don\u2019t care about her", "You're whining about how you only wanted to be alone and why can't she just give you that when you don't give her anything in return (cool that you avoided my question about the good you bring to her life, I'm guessing it's not impressive) when YOU told her you have a day for her, about how hard it is to talk to her when she's crying, how you already have plans, how you deserve so much without giving an explanation as to why\nWhy are you keeping her around? You haven't said one nice thing about her", "Do you want to be alone all week or do you want to have a girlfriend? Because when you put everything else above her, the message you are sending is that you'd rather be alone than be with her, that your problems are greater than hers and that you just don't care enough to make time for her. Which doesn't read like a partnership to me.", "I wanted to be alone and I think she should\u2019ve respected it", "Poor girl :(", "I\u2019m betting narc", "Also I apologized to her", "If my neck wasn\u2019t hurting I would\u2019ve stayed with her\u2026.", "I think everyone is right that it\u2019s my fault and it was bad to leave her alone at the park. I want to help her and I like spending time with her (I\u2019m just not good at expressing my feelings) but should I have to cancel everything just because she didn\u2019t want to be alone?", "Yeah and she\u2019s still upset that I wouldn\u2019t see her the rest of this week"]}
