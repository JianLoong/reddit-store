We know that moving into a new home always comes with unexpected costs, right after you've probably depleted most of your funds. So, for Christmas we gave her $4000. Our son we gave a few different gifts totaling somewhere around $800.\n\nOur daughter had to work Christmas, but we did Christmas on the 26th and she stayed with us for the holidays from then until yesterday. Our son still lives with us, and today he told us both that he didn't want to say anything while his sister was here, but his feelings were hurt by the disparity in the value of the gifts. We explained that the gifts we got him were tailored to his interests, but his sister has just passed a big life milestone where money is more important to her right now than sentiment. He said it's still hurtful because it feels like we are more proud of her than him.\n\nMy wife got really frustrated when he said that and asked why he would choose the least charitable interpretation of our actions. He said that's just how he felt and he couldn't control it. I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive. He said that was all fine and good, but it still hurt to get a worse present and feel like an afterthought.\n\nMy wife asked if he expected us to get him four thousand dollars worth of gifts. He said no, but he expected the gifts between him and his sister to be equal. My wife said that's the same thing, and my son said it isn't. He said we could have given her the monetary equivalent of what we gave him. I told him that it isn't really fair for him to decide how much we spend on someone else's gift. Furthermore, cash is less personal than gifts, so giving her a cash equivalent to what he got would be her getting the \"worse\" gift.\n\nHe said we weren't listening to him, just justifying. My wife said we didn't need to justify anything, and he was being entitled. At that point he said he didn't want to talk unless everyone was civil and he went to his room. He skipped lunch (breakfast for him) today, and when he left for work he didn't say goodbye even though I was right by the door.\n\nMy wife is irritated, and my son is clearly resenting us. I can't really decide if we're in the wrong here. On the one hand, we should be able to give our money to whoever we want. On the other, I never want to hurt my son's feelings.

If so, did you tell him that?", "I don't think either of you are TA, but I do think there's issues all around. \n\nI think the crux of the problem is that you chose to do this at Christmas. If you had waited a month and gifted your daughter the money as a housewarming gift then there wouldn't be a need for him to drawn a comparison. It would be assumed that when your son eventually got to that place in his life, you'd also return the gesture his way.\n\nAs the youngest kid in my family who typically also feels like an afterthought -- this is usually not about the gift, this is probably deeper than this one moment, but he is choosing this moment where it's obvious to point it out to you. Perhaps let him open up a larger conversation about whether he feels this way more often than just right now. \n\nTo be fair to you - your son is significantly younger and there's ample time for you to make the same gesture when he crosses this milestone, and he could stand to keep that in mind.", "EDIT:  After reading your responses, YTA.  I have no issue with you giving your daughter money.  Hell - I have no issue with you giving her more money.  Buying a house can suck, and things pop up that you never expect.  And everything is expensive.   But YTA for (1) framing it as a Christmas gift and not a housewarming gift and (2) the way you treated your son.  He did it right - he didn't attack - he just said these are my feelings.  And your wife immediately started going on the offensive and belittling his feelings.  Don't you want your son to feel comfortable coming to you with his problems?  Discussing his feelings with you?  Why would he feel comfortable speaking to either of you now?  If he comes to you with a problem - are you going to help - or are you going to sit there while his mom calls him names?  That's what makes you the asshole in my eyes.  He handled it right.  You guys didn't handle it correctly to begin with (though your heart seems to have been in the right place) and then you definitely didn't handle it right after the conversation.    \n\n\nINFO:  Why did it have to be at Christmas time that you gave her money for *possible* repairs?  Why not wait for X, Y, or Z to break down, and then cover the cost for her?  What happens if she doesn't have $3,200 worth of repairs come up?", "YTA for doing this at Xmas.\n\nI am the youngest of 4 siblings, my oldest sister is 10 years older than me, so we definitely reached milestones at different times. Things like wedding money, housewarming gifts/money, graduation gifts obviously came at different times for each of us and were not tied to group holidays like Xmas. \n\nYou could have given your daughter an $800 check or gift for Xmas, and $3200 for closing on the house at a different time/setting. Then you could tell your son \"we will be so excited to give you a gift of money to help out when you buy your first home!\" Instead, now it is a very disproportional Xmas gift, which is sure to raise some jealousy.\n\nEdit: My judgement is very light and you seem like very generous parents who want to help both of your kids get ahead in life. I definitely don't think you \"owe\" your son more now than an explanation and an apology for timing and reaction to his concerns. In the future I would just keep shared gift opening times \"in kind\" for both kids, and stick to milestone gifts timed with the milestone.\n\nEdit: Also getting a lot of \"rent free\" comments about the son. From OPs comments it seems like the daughter lived at home until the house purchase to save up money, and they have no issues with the son living at home now and want the same opportunity for him, so I don't really see it as an applicable factor in the judgement.", "It\u2019s not even a small amount either, I mean 4K and 800 is a big difference. If you plan to give him 4K when he gets a house then maybe no biggie, also dunno why your wife is so irritated by him explaining the clear disparity. \n\nI\u2019d expect my kid to be pissed if I made one a sandwich and not the other.", "I think it was a bad time to give her the 4k.. should have been done as a housewarming gift rather than christmas\u2026 I would however tell your son that when he buys his first home he can expect to be gifted the 4k at that time\u2026 that is fair and justified.", "INFO: did you ask him if it was about the money or about his feelings? Because it seems that he just wanted to share his feelings and you wanted to justify what you\u2019re doing.

By lumping a large amount of cash into her Christmas gift, you invite unfavorable comparisons.", "NAH. Your explanation for the disparity in gifts is reasonable and your son seemed to address what he viewed as an inequity very maturely. Everyone in this thread calling your son entitled and immature are obtuse idiots. The way you describe it, he approached raising his concern in a very mature way that would cause the least amount of drama. Even if OP did nothing wrong, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for a 22 year old to have felt wronged in this situation without being given the explanation. He\u2019s only in the wrong if he continues to sulk but he\u2019s certainly entitled to feeling frustrated for a short period of time.", "INFO do you plan on giving the same amount of money to your son when he buys a house?

Just set aside $4000 to give him when he turns 26, and let him know you have done so.", "Yta more so your wife she\u2019s so dismissive of your sons feeling why?? He came to you with his concerns very respectfully and fair even waited till your daughter wasn\u2019t around, Its a lot of money you gifted and there was no reason to do it at Christmas as it was clearly a housewarming gift instead", "YTA. You could have handled it way better. You are making it seem like it\u2019s his fault for being upset. His feelings are valid and you shouldn\u2019t dismiss them and get defensive saying he is being greedy. \n\nWould you give him $4000 if he had bought a house this year? My guess is yes. So I think you should have explained that to him, and that it will be something to look forward to when he reaches that milestone. Also I think you could have given an equal value of physical gifts to both your kids, and separately, privately given cash to you daughter for the house. Remove it from the Christmas gifts scenario so no one feels like an afterthought.", "YTA. Tell him $800 was her Xmas gift. $3200 was her New House gift. Tell him when he buys a house you will give him $3200.", "YTA - for delving in unequal treatment of your kids.   Yes, there are life events you want to celebrate but never set up one child preferentially over another.", "YTA. Hear me out. Christmas and Birthdays are not days to give milestone gifts when you have children.\n\nMy parents gave us \u201chousewarming\u201d gifts when each one of us bought a house. You get what you are trying to do without someone getting hurt. Treat it kinda like how you would a college fund for your kids. \n\nFor holidays and Birthdays, we all get the same money value equivalent gift. \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s about the perception. You tell your children you recognize milestones when the milestones occur and not months later on holidays and birthdays.\n\nAlso, I think you are an asshole for not recognizing how your son was telling you how he was feeling. He wasn\u2019t demanding anything from you but recognizing the perception you gave him from your and your wife\u2019s actions. At the end of the day, it\u2019s your money but it\u2019s still his feelings.", "NTA. I feel like people on here hate \u2018favoritism\u2019 so much that they think you have to treat your kids equally every second of their lives. The fact is, when children are different ages/at different places in life, they\u2019ll be going through different milestones at different times. For example, if one of your children had gotten their license that year and you got them a car for Christmas, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to spend a car\u2019s worth of money on your other child that Christmas. That\u2019d be ridiculous. As long as you treat the kids the same in the long run and help them out similarly for these milestones, it\u2019s okay for there to be a little disparity every once in a while.", "Your error was in making them Xmas gifts that you gave her at the same time as he got his gifts.\n\nTheir Xmas gifts should be comparable.\n\nGive her the other gifts as house warming presents.\n\nYTA", "YTA for doing this during Christmas and making it a Christmas gift. I think it\u2019s more of a house warming gift that I don\u2019t think it should have been known to your son.  It\u2019s a large sum of money to give, and even though it was for your daughters house and potential issues that could arise, it should have stayed between you and your son not involved.  You very well can do that same exact thing for him when he gets a home, only not discuss it openly with the other person. \n\nI completely understand why your son has pointed it out, and he didn\u2019t ask for his gifts to match to her value. He wasn\u2019t asking for more, just pointed out that you openly gave her $3,200 more in value regardless of what it\u2019s was than you gave him. I\u2019m sure he appreciates the gifts you gave to him.\n\nIf it happened to me it would feel like saying i only asked for X for Christmas this year that\u2019s worth $20 and my sister didn\u2019t ask for anything and my parents don\u2019t know what to get her so they are giving her $50 gift card of her choice to get what she wants.", "Seems to me part of what you gave your daughter was a housewarming gift, and why would he expect to receive that too?  If she has a wedding, baby, etc, does he expect to receive the equivalent in those situations? \n\nHonestly, $800 is a lot of money for one person for Christmas, much less a grown-ass adult. I'd let him know when he hits similar milestones, you'll gift him similarly.  Unless you show consistent favoritism to her, he needs to stop keeping score and be more grateful.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I agree with others that the timing was way wrong. You could\u2019ve given her a check after the holidays or even before and then a few house warming type gifts for Christmas. Your son is a thoughtful and considerate young man to mention this in private rather than involve his sister as he knows she\u2019d also feel bad about the disparity. And, for the record, just because cash isn\u2019t as personal as other gifts you can\u2019t change its value.

If the SON had bought a house while his sister was at home it likely would've been the same thing. He would've gotten the money and his sis would've gotten the items.\n\nWhile the sons feelings were ok and telling his parents he felt was ok, it IS NOT ok to be entitled. It's THEIR money and he got $800 worth of things. That's a VERY generous gift to anyone. \n\nThe parents wanted to help their kid with the house and they'll likely give the son the same resources. \n\nNTA", "YTA. \n\nIt sounds like your son was trying to calmly share his hurt feelings. His feelings are valid. It doesn't sound like he was trying to demand anymore gifts from you or say that he didn't appreciate it. He was hurt. And instead of validating him by saying \"I can totally see why you would feel that way, son. We are also proud of you and can see how this Christmas came off in a way that we didn't\" you chose to justify your choices as he mentioned. It sounds like he just wanted to be heard.\n\nAs others have suggested, it would have been better to give your daughter a house warming gift in the amount you did and so a Christmas gift close in value to your son's. \n\nIn another comment you mentioned likely giving your son a similar amount when he buys a home. It might be helpful to mention to him that you put away money for when he buys a house.", "I know what others are going to say, but I'm going with NTA. \n\nMy parents used to tell us all the time (especially at Christmas) that sometimes one child is more expensive then the other. I was always the more expensive child (ballet lessons, summer camp) year round but at Christmas I was happy getting less. When your son purchases a house, will you give him that same amount?

You can say that yes, your daughter received more, but that's because you were lumping in Xmas **and** a house warming gift together.   \n\n\nI can see where he's coming from, but his attitude seems really immature, and he's way past the age where he's bean counting.    \n\n\nSince you've gifted both a car, you can take that analogy.  When your sister got a car, did you expect to receive gifts of an equal value of a car? No, but did we get you a car? Yes. You and your sisters have 4 years apart, and it's normal that you reach milestones at different times in your life. We intend to celebrate those milestones equally.  Now get off your high horse, get over it, and stop acting like a little shit.", "YTA - for doing it at christmas. The right way to do this would have been to give them equal gifts.

Unfrotunately, by the time I bought my house my mother had passed away. My dad was still here but it is HIS money to do with as he chooses. So him not giving me a house warming monetary give like my siblings did not upset me.\n\nPersonally, I think you should reword things to your son and tell him you only gave her $500 for christmas. The $3,500 was a house warming present but you did not feel like writing a second check.\n\nyour son has nothing to say about it however. He lives in your house, probably rent free and utility free.

We had different needs.\n\nI think you gave the wrong reasoning to your son. Explain that when he someday owns his own home, he's likely to get a similar gift from you - it's just that he sounds like he wants his payout early and you're not willing to do that. He's already living rent free in your home and has been at least 4 years, so I imagine he's *easily* saved up 4,000 in cash over that time. Did his sister stay a comparable amount of time at home rent free or did she have to pay her way sooner? If she did, it can even be argued you've already gifted him the equivalent or more. That's the issue with transactional comparison; you can end up down a rabbit hole as the situation becomes more complex.\n\nIn the future, consider a housewarming gift separate of the gifts given to both kids, so there's no confusion.", "\"On the other, I never want to hurt my son's feelings.\"\n\nYou never want to, but we all know that's not a reasonable goal.

I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive.

He is a bit old for this sort of behavior and I would be annoyed about it.", "NTA. I like that your son held his tongue until an appropriate moment for a civil discussion and then made his points, although you didn\u2019t come to an agreement. He is being a bit petty about dollar values, but you could point out that the year he got a car his sister\u2019s gift wasn\u2019t an equivocal value.

Their needs are never going to be exactly equal, and no one's entitled to any certain gift. What's more is that he's likely to get a similarly-valued gift at some point in the future, but he's not there yet.\n\nThat said, it's pretty easy to see why he interprets this as you favoring your daughter - that's a a pretty significant discrepancy in value, and taken in isolation it looks bad. \n\nI'd say you owe him a better explanation - for instance, if you've helped both kids with education costs at age 18, point out that you gave a lot more to her at that time than he got at 14, but when he reached the same age he got the same treatment. You can't make him sit and listen though, and that's a problem he needs to solve himself.", "NTA. I'm assuming this is a one time thing where you got your daughter significantly more than your son (otherwise he would have brought that up).

This way, he'll know that you're planning on treating them equally. \n\nI would also ask him if he's been feeling insecure lately, bc parts of his argument just aren't rational wkthout something deeper behind it. On one hand, I see what he meams about the disparity between gifts, but on the other, I feel like it shouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility for him to consider that you're combining her Christmas gift and housewarming gift into one giant money bundle. And saying that $800 worth of stuff is the worse gift when she's likely going to put all the money you gave her into basic repairs/furniture/installation/whatever imstead of fun things she wants like he got? Sorry, but your wife is right, he does aound entitled. \n\nI would point that out (again), too: that you didn't give her \"fun\" money, you gave her money she needs in order to have a functional home, whereas he got all the \"fun\" gifts that Christmas is supposed to be all about.\n\nEdit: I say ask if he's been feeling insecure bc the way he starts the discussion is very telling to me. It sounds like maybe he hasn't been feeling confident about his abilities and accomplishments compared to his sister, especially if she just bought a house. I know he's younger, but that doesn't always stop us from comparing ourselves to others, especially siblings, and thinking \"will I be able to do that when I'm they're age?\" A house is a huge accomplishment for anyone right now: he might be feeling inadequate in his ability to be able to afford one himself one day.", "NTA.

This was not a charitable gift, it was a Xmas gift that had a much higher value than the ones you gave your son. Even if you so give him the same when he buys his own house (and that's assuming he's ever in a position to be able to do that!) then he's going to think you're only doing it out of guilt because he raised this with you.

Money aside, it didn\u2019t seem they were willing to listen to him or at least have a discussion with him about it.

He waited for his sister to leave before approaching the situation and left the conversation when the mum started verbally abusing him.\n\nThe parents could have kept the difference (3200$) in a savings account and if the daughter needed it, they cold give it to her.

Isn't that all very, I don't know, cold? To count every penny?", "I saw it in another comment that he lives at home and while he helps out with chores, he doesn't pay rent. I tend to take these posts at face value and I didn't get the idea that OP was in the habit of spoiling one kid and not the other. Especially when the son has received $800 (!!!!!) in gifts, and the daughter has hit a clear milestone. The discrepancy in money seems very easily explained, for me. You may say the son feels slighted or unloved, but I read it as jealousy. Two sides, perhaps, of the same coin.", "If that's the case, why did they give sister the $4k for Christmas instead of when she bought the house in July, if this was a milestone gift\n\nIf this was better planned, they could have also given gifts to sister for \"Xmas\" and then cash as a \"Milestone\" and upfront told son thats how it was going to work before hand - that it wasn't an Xmas gift, but a life milestone separate from Xmas.\n\nIt doesn't really sound like they made that distinction clearly enough, which is just poor handling from OP and wife. We always make sure shared gift giving days are equitable for our gremlins so we can avoid this - and if we cant make things financially equitable, we make them socially equitable. What really makes this situation suck is that OP's son tried to share how he felt in a pretty mature and respectable way; but the story makes it sound like this devolved into chaos because the parents couldn't effectively communicate this was supposed to be a milestone gift.", "Maybe the OP will change his mind because of the reactions to that plan here, but according to everything we've been told the Op has celebrated milestones ECT equally. \n\nThey surprised the daughter yes, but they did it in front of the son.

I don't think that anyone here is expecting you to blow $4000 on your son for Christmas but your daughter being in a financial bind of her own accord isn't a reason to treat them so disparately on the holidays.", "I can see why he feels that\u2019s unfair. Your presents to him were generous and thoughtful, and there\u2019s also a big difference between $800 and $4000. I would probably have given them both an item or two worth about the same, and the same amount of money. You could easily set up a house savings account for your son and say \u2018when you get a home, you can have this for the incidentals. Your sister can do with this money now, and you\u2019ll get there in time as well.\u2019\n\nEqually, you could have given them both comparable Christmas presents, and made the house set-up gift a separate phenomenon, making it clear to your son that you will do the same for him, and that it has nothing to do with Christmas. \n\nIt took me about two minutes to come up with these ideas for a simple and fair compromise. \n\nYour money and your choice, but that\u2019s quite a disparity and it reads as unfair to me too.", "You gave your daughter 5X as much as your son, how could you NOT notice the disparity.

You just don't want to think you're the bad guy. Some tact would have done you and your wife wonders here.", "YTA.. wowsa! Your son was actually the mature one in this conversation. I wouldn't even call him entitled. He would have been fine with $5  gift card as long as his sister got the equivalent. That's what you guys aren't understanding. You and your wife's reasoning makes sense to you as a parent, but it's a shitty reason for the kid or kids who feel the slight first hand. Hypothetical. Later on, when your son buys his first house and you aren't in the same financial position you are now, will you still dish out the 4k to him even if you can't afford to or will you say sorry... we just don't have it? You are setting yourself up for failure as parents in your son's eyes.", "YTA for making it public.\n\nNTA for the disparity \n\nWe get it. It's OK to give someone moving in more. Which I'm sure you'd do the same for your son if and when he moved into his own house. \n\nBut those types of gifts are done personally.", "YTA This is easy it's not like you gave her $1k and gave your son $800 you gave her $4k and then act surprised that your son felt slighted. Of course with justifications and then attacks on him it sounds like your son hit the nail on the head that you have a favorite child and it isn't him.", "YTA. You give it to her separately not at Christmas. On top of that, it sounds like your son approach you very politely to talk about something that deeply hurt him. Your wife acted like a gigantic AH.", "I got around 5000\u20ac from my parents when I moved into my first flat. And I will get another 5000\u20ac before my brother takes over their farm. That money is considered my inheritance - I won't get anything else. Same goes for my sister she gets what she get, but it's considered her inheritance.\n\nMy sister gets around 20.000\u20ac worth of lumber from their own Forrest so she and her husband can renovate their farm. \n\nI don't consider this unfair - first i don't have a farm/house and don't plan on it. Second if I had I would have gotten the same. Third they need to spend a lot more money than I had to years ago, since everything in building got really expensive.\n\nMaybe you could have given her the money before or after Christmas and not said it's a Christmas gift.\n\nAs long you would do the same for your son  NTA - but you probably should have communicated it better.\nIf you wouldn't do the same for your son, I would consider you YTA.", "YTA. Parents you f\u2019d up. Money should\u2019ve been given to daughter outside of Xmas.", "YTA kind of. I don't know your son but I can guess what your son is feeling is a little deeper than jealousy or resentment. While there is clearly privilege reeking from this entire interaction, and that's probably an issue within itself, what your son is really feeling is shame and inadequacy. When you are a young guy living at home with your parents in the US there is a weird kind of pressure and expectation on you. Its always an idea like you'll need to get on your feet or somehow you've made the wrong choices in life and are trying to catch up. Personally I think 22 is way too young to feel this way but you can't help it when most people measure you by how much money you make and what job you do. That's why he felt the disproportionate gifts was a jab at him. I can bet you he gets little jabs all the time from various different people (hint=mother). You need to be aware of how he's probably feeling and maybe try to go through what's really going on within him. I can bet you real love and support not just monetary support would go a LONG way in helping him sort himself out.", "YTA, not so much for the gift, but now you've guaranteed that your son won't come to you in the future because whether or not you agree with them, they're still his feelings and you've completely invalidated them. I wouldn't speak to you either. It's WAY more than disproportionate gifting now. Now, it's most likely that he doesn't trust you. And you deserve that.", "YTA so your daughter basically got rewarded with a higher value gift because she was better off than your son and was able to move out and buy her own place. So who knows maybe it would have been fair to give your worse off son more? Have you ever considered he might feel like a failure living at home while the sister was able to buy her own home and the gift made that more apparent to him? That she gets more becausr she accomplished that? Also the repair argument is bullshit. If they needed money for repairs you vould THEN offered them financial help not automatically give her a large sum and your son near to nothing in comparison.", "IMO they each should have received $800 worth ish of presents \u201cfor Christmas\u201d and the additional money you gave her should have been at the time she got the house so it was very specifically for that purpose. Bonus points for not making your son watch you do it. He could likely really use the 4K as I\u2019m sure he\u2019d like to move out of the house eventually. \n\nThe way you wrote out the discussion, he showed incredible emotional maturity in trying to describe why he was upset. He was not met with open ears, only offence and defensiveness.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say NAH, and a soft Y T A. It's not like you gave her (and not him) $4000 just because. You gave her $4000 to help with her *new house*. \n\nSure $800 is a lot less money than $4000, but it's still a shit ton to spend on gifts! The soft Y T A is due to you not explaining it well to your son it seems. It's fair that he's hurt and feels less appreciated. However, he's not a child. Which means you can explain fully to him why your daughter got so much money for Xmas and that it's not about favoritism but rather helping a child out with a huge life milestone. And as his parent, you can be there for him too. Maybe he realizes it's not a fully rational feeling and is trying to talk it out with you. However you need to be receptive to what he's saying and not defend yourself against his feelings. \n\nOn the same note, there is a certain amount of \"he can get over it\". This isn't some crazy difference of her getting $4000 for the house and then $1000 in gifts. To me, it's pretty entitled to expect $4000 of gifts because his sister got that much for her house! And making it about it being a bad time at Xmas is ridiculous! If anything, a $4000 Xmas cheque towards a child who just bought a house is fantastic timing. December is a really expensive month and can leave people catching up on debt at the beginning of the new year. \n\nOverall, I don't think this is about the gifts or the amount of money spent. Any rational adult would go \"oh that's parents helping a kid out money\" not \"that's my parents love my sister more money\". It may be a good idea to engage compassionately with your son. Listen to his feelings rather than come up with hypothetical fixes. What's done is done and there is no changing the amount spent on gifts. What's important here is making him feel loved and understanding why the gift difference is upsetting him.", "Honestly your wife needs to grow up.  Not sure what her attitude is about.  You guys made a terrible decision. And when you asked if he thinks he deserves 4k of gifts he said no yet..... you got your other child 4k of gifts. Doesn't matter if it's via a personal gift or money.  Give your son 4k he could have bought the 800 of gifts you got him and had a left over of 3200..   you chose a favorite here.

Sucks to suck I guess", "I think the mistake you made here was making the money a Christmas gift so there\u2019s a natural comparison. However, the main reason I\u2019m going YTA is invalidating his feelings.", "I get that your intentions were fine and frankly $800 is already an insane amount to spend on a child for Christmas, but YTA for how you handled this. The best thing to have done would have been to spend equally on them for Christmas and give your daughter a separate check as a house-warming gift, making it clear to your son that you'll be giving the same for him when he purchases a house. This was just done without any tact at all and I don't think you or your wife are justified in being angry with your son for feeling it was unfair.", "You and your unfeeling wife are both \n\nYTA \n\nHe came to you respectfully, and your wife immediately got nasty and defensive\u2026and I\u2019ll tell you right now deep down your wife knows it was wrong or she wouldn\u2019t have gotten that way immediately. She would have heard him out then calmly explained the reasons behind it and then perhaps would have said that you two never meant to hurt him\u2026 but nooooo \u2026 she was too busy dismissing his feelings because deep down, she knew he was right! And so do you! Her actions calling him a bean counter was pretty unkind too. \n\nI understand that kindness of the gesture, but I honestly can say I don\u2019t know anybody that would not feel slightly hurt. At least your son was being respectful and open about how he felt lesser than\u2026 and way to go for your wife to reiterate it! \n\nI\u2019m\nSorry if I\u2019m coming off as rude, but as someone who\u2019s been lesser than her whole life.. by parents.. I get it.", "So you even made a show of the gift would it have killed you to give you some heads up then since this was meant as a surprise not just a Christmas gift like this whole situation was not handled well at all and your wife her attitude towards it seriously is he adopted is he a stepchild I don't understand your wife's reaction", "YTA. You spent 5 times as much money on his sister. Of course that makes him feel like shit. Did you spend $4000 worth of your time making him his present or going to procure his presents? How can you have two kids and not realise that you have to treat them equally if you want to avoid making one of them feel like you love them less? Your son feels like you prefer his sister or think she\u2019s worth more than him because that\u2019s what you were saying to him by spending 5 times less on him. Doesn\u2019t matter if it was $1 vs $5 or $1 million vs $5 million, the discrepancy sends a message.", "YTA. Your kids should have received the same monetary value at Xmas and then can gift a different amount of $ for achieving life milestones at your discretion, though still making effort to keep things relatively even as milestones are achieved at different points in life.", "YTA. The fact you did this on Christmas makes you the asshole. You could have given your daughter that money at any time, take her out to dinner after the closing and given it to her. This was a dick move on your parts. You are a double asshole for blowing him off when he very nicely tried to approach you to and explain his feelings.", "YTA. I think the weird thing is to do this kind of disbalanced Christmas gifting.

For Christmas and my birthday they gave me stuff for the house and $$ towards furniture. My parents spend an equal amount on all 3 of us and sometimes I get more to open and sometimes I don\u2019t.

The price should not matter this much, this is pettiness.\n\nI never received any Christmas or birthday gifts from my parents in my life. In fact, we were very poor but rather than my parents admitting that, we resented them over the fact that they don\u2019t celebrate Christmas.\n\nChristmas is a time of family and giving a gift in itself is a selfless act.

Simply saying something like 'your sister's was a combined Christmas gift and housewarming fund' was all that needed to be said. Possibly followed by 'when you purchase a house you'll get a similar fund', if that is the intent. \n\nClaiming the gifts aren't dissimilar because 'cash is impersonal' and some of the other arguments OP puts forward are ridiculous.

Labeling the gift differently, giving it at a different time, would be an insanely simple fix that would change nothing but how it comes across to the kids.

My siblings both knew long before high school graduation that that my parents will pay an equitable amount toward whatever higher education path they choose, should they want it, at any time in their lives, even if they are married adults. They both chose not to go to college, so they didn't just get a check for thousands of dollars for fun. That's because tuition wasn't a Christmas present. It was financial support from my parents for my future.\n\nSame goes for weddings, down payments, whatever. There is money in the bucket for all of us for all of these things, but we don't just get a pile of cash because another one of us got a down payment. It's earmarked for specific things. I know this because they've explained it to all of us very clearly, to avoid this exact scenario.\n\nBy contrast, my parents go way out of their way to make sure they spend the exact same dollar amount on us at holidays, to show that they love us all the same.

Not primarily for the disparity in the value of the gifts, but rather ironically, for making your daughter's Christmas about her house. You should have offered that separately from Christmas. While I typically don't go in for people complaining about the difference in value of their gifts, the fact that *you* made your monetary gift to your daughter a Christmas gift and that came out to more than four times what you spent on your son makes you an asshole to him for signaling that he's worth less and for signaling to her that gifts weren't necessary because you gave her house money.\n\nI will tell you this as someone whose own parent has done the whole \"I helped you out, so I don't need to get you a gift spiel,\" my dad once offered to fly me out to see him for the holidays when I couldn't afford to, myself. I didn't ask for him to fly me. He offered. It was great to get there and see him, but then he took the wind out of my sails when he \"braced\" me for the fact that there wouldn't be anything for me to open because my plane ticket was my gift. There were several problems with this: first, he had never said anything beforehand about my ticket being my gift; second, I was expected to then basically sit there on Christmas morning and watch the nuclear unit exchange gifts with each other, including the gifts I brought for them, without getting something to open; third, the fact that this fucker had the audacity to frame it as my ticket being a gift to me when it should've been just as much a gift to *him* to see his son, especially since he's the one who offered to fly me out.\n\nSo when I read this, I think of my dad, who has always been arbitrary with when, how, and to whom he gives to others, and under what circumstances. And when you in turn read my response, understand that people don't actually care about the monetary value of their Christmas gifts. They care to know that they were thought of. *But* when it comes to siblings, when there is a drastic disparity in monetary value of gifts, it does communicate favoritism whether you want to remain ignorant to that or not.

As a parent, I can understand being upset when your kid automatically assumes the worst of you. Being a parent doesn't invalidate your own feelings. I can also understand the son's feelings. I disagree, but I understand. His gift was more personal, took actual thought, etc, but its monetary value was 1/5 of the daughter's gift. That said, gift giving shouldn't be a transactional thing.

The amount of money you spend on each of your children doesn't have anything to do with how much you love them. If your son thinks that the amount you spend on each of your children is reflective of how much you love each of them, then you need to have a conversation with him about why he thinks that way. There might be some deep-seated resentment regarding the way you treat your daughter relative to how you treat your son (that doesn't even have to do with money) that you don't know about.

The only thing he did right was to bring this up later and not make a scene in front of his sister.", "his FEELINGS are not invalid.  there's always a reason someone feels the way they do.   he FELT hurt and like he was being treated unfairly.   a child can be terrified of their first day of school even though we know it's completely safe and they will probably be fine once they settle in.  but their feelings are real and they are their feelings and their feelings are valid.   \n\nif someone thinks theres' aliens about to land on their roof because they have schizophrenia and they are hyperventilating and freaking out because thats scary, their feelings are valid.  you don't need to invalidate someone's feelings to disagree with how they see things.   you can say to that person \"i understand that that feels very scary for you\" without saying yes there's aliens on the roof.  this is what is called \\*validating feelings\\*.  so people, like the son in this story, feel heard and understood and like their parent cares and \\*wants\\* to understand what is going on within them, even if the parent disagrees with the logic behind it.", "dude I got an ~90 dollars gift for graduating and christmas and I got emotional for recieving that much, I can't get in my head how someone could feel less after getting 800 dollars for just another christmas", "I scrolled up and re-read the post because I thought I missed something.", "You're asking why all the Redditors would rush to the defense of the younger brother who lives at home who only got $800 worth of Steam cards while big sister who's actually doing something with her life gets more?", "its almost like reddit is full of spoiled brats\n\nlol", "Yes, he totally needs to start paying rent! He's getting pampered by his parents at an age were others are already independent and financially on their own.  Them he whines about his Christmas presents worth is \"only\" 800 dollar? Dude needs a reality check.", ">This level of disparity\n\nBut it's only a disparity if you look at it just monetarily. If I spent 4 weeks making you a handmade gift (that you could get $80 for on Etsy), and I gave someone else $150, are you saying their gift is better? No, of course not.\n\nThe value of a gift also includes the effort, thought, and love behind it.", "I thought I was losing my damn mind reading these other comments! my kids are 6 and 10, and they both know perfectly well that if I ever hear them counting gifts, comparing them (in a negative sense, not like \"hey, check out this cool thing\"), etc there'll be hell to pay. Like... Any sign of holiday entitlement, brattiness, ingratitude, general asshole behavior starting, and we will scale WAY back. \n\n\nHell, the 6 year old is perfectly capable of understanding that sometimes his sister gets cool stuff that he might want, but can't have yet because he doesn't need it/ isn't old enough/ just didn't and that's the way it is. Things aren't always equal.\n\n\n I can't imagine the balls on this 22 year old man complaining that his parents spent almost a grand on him for Christmas, while he's living in their home, but they gave his sister more for a specific purpose. It's not like they threw $4k at her for no reason. Who cares if it was at Christmas! He's an adult ffs.", "When I got my older child her first phone this year, I made sure to give it at her birthday (2 days after Christmas) instead of as a Christmas present in part because I didn't want to invite drama from her little brother about why she got a phone for Christmas and he didn't. Making it a gift for a \"milestone\" birthday seemed like a good way to avoid that, as well as give him a clear idea of \"If we feel you're responsible enough, you'll have a good shot of getting one too at the same age\". \n\n\nThe key difference here is that the little brother in question is SIX YEARS OLD. Were he older than... Let's say 10 (being rather generous), I'd fully expect him to be able to understand that it doesn't matter if she gets it on the 25th or the 27th, she's getting it from us either way and *it doesn't matter*. If he was 22 and I still had to consider this? I'd be incredibly disappointed.\n\n\nThis guy is 22 years old. This shouldn't even be a conversation.", "Most of the people on Reddit are teenagers so it\u2019s skewed", "I can't believe the top comment is a Y T A and it makes me seriously question how old these commenter are.", "Ok I also felt like this, but was starting to wonder if I was crazy with these comments.", "She bought the house in July lol", "No kidding. He's a 22 year old who lives at home, he should be able to go \"fair enough\" when the parents explain the reason for the disparity is to mitigate the unanticipated costs that may come around after buying a house.", "Imagine getting 800 dollars worth of gifts at 22 and still complaining about it. Absolutely wild to me that these people exist and half this sub is defending it.", "This was my thought, especially with him being 22. To me the son was being tremendously entitled after receiving $800 worth of gifts.", "The thing that gets me is that entitlement and self absorption is supposed to be replaced with perspective taking and empathy naturally in child development. This can be affected by trauma, etc., but how many of these posters have abusive parents? Because they are projecting everywhere.", "All the YTAs are giving rich people tbh. They also don't seem very mature. Like how hard is it to go \"huh sis is moving into a whole house and probably won't be able to spend the money like how I, an adult man living with my parents rent free with free meals, and everything else, would spend it.\"", "I get where the son is coming from. The dollar amounts were never that much but I was in a similar situation - I just never brought it up. \n\nMy siblings would receive money often for things and I\u2019d never speak up. I\u2019d hear my parents talk about how they helped my sibling with this and that, even at one point joking, \u201cI guess we owe you money.\u201d But I didn\u2019t ask for any and I always felt weird asking for money because I\u2019d always hear my parents loathe over how a sibling needed XYZ and I didn\u2019t want to be a bother.\n\nThen one Christmas I hear that siblings are getting big gifts worth $1600~. Parents ask me what I want and I just say that I can think of a bunch of gift ideas but I\u2019m trying to pay down some debt so if they\u2019re okay with it then maybe some cash instead. \n\nChristmas that year comes around and I\u2019m given an envelope with a four hundred dollars inside. And I was conflicted. $400 was a great gift and I was appreciative of the fact to get it, but in the back of my mind I was also a little hurt. Knowing my sisters were getting something four times as much just kept popping up in my mind and I honestly felt bad for it. \n\nI was jealous of my sisters, I was happy for what they were getting, and I wasn\u2019t ungrateful for the gift I received but my feelings were hurt because it was the one time I actually asked for help with some finances and my sisters were getting 4x the amount.\n\nI battled with that thought a bit, I thought about bringing it up but decided against it because I didn\u2019t want to come off as ungrateful or as entitled much like OPs son is being painted here.\n\nHaving been in similar shoes to OPs son, he might be struggling and is at a point where he feels like he can\u2019t talk to them about it. I know OP said they\u2019d help his son when the time comes, something my parents told me in many situations, the son might not feel comfortable asking for that same help. \n\nI think you\u2019re correct on that it\u2019s not the amount but the underlying feeling of feeling like you\u2019re worth less in their eyes.", "Idk man, I'm delighted whenever I'm gifted cash/visa gift cards because it signifies they value me enough to not give me a shitty gift they don't know if I'll use or not, but they'll gift money so I *can* get what I want. It's putting their pride aside for the betterment of the gifted.", "Then compare it so it is more relatable to you. Your parents give you a specifically themed stationary gift set and they give all your siblings each a gaming computer. Wouldn\u2019t you at least stop to think about that. Maybe hurt your feelings?"]}
