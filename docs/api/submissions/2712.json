I wouldn't have to because I wouldn't have made her go in the first fucking place.", "NTA. Your husband is a colossal A H. Show him this.", "NTA. You didn't fall asleep to be rude, you were exhausted from taking care of a newborn while your husband was sick. He and his parents can't give you a break? Or offer to let you lie down in the guest room while you're at their house? I bet if he fell asleep, he wouldn't feel guilty or annoyed at himself.", "NTA. You probably TRIED to stay awake--did the head bobbing thing. Anyway, a new paren must be gentle with themselves because you are sleep-deprived.", "Who has the flue for 8 days straight?!", "NTA\nYour husband needs to be more understanding that life with a newborn is hard", "That's crazy! I have no children and get a healthy amount of sleep... I've still fallen asleep on my in laws couch once or twice while waiting for dinner! Who cares?!\n\nIt's not like you fell asleep mid conversation... and if you did, they should be bundling you off to the spare room (if they have one) for a fucking lie down while they keep the kid off your hands for a bit!\n\nSo NTA.", "\"but we\u2019re both sleep deprived.\" \n\nMaybe he was using the logic that if he was able to stay awake while being sleep deprived you could have too, but he needs to realize its different situations and not everyone handles sleep deprivement the same. As someone who fell asleep in class more times than I like to admit I know its not something you can really control sometimes so he\u00b4s the asshole but I may see his point.", "NTA. I agree with the general consensus in the comments but I would also like to point out, if he\u2019s well enough to go to a birthday party then he is well enough to start picking back up at home.", "ESH. \n\nYou need to have the backbone to stand up for your needs. I think you should have told your husband that you were staying home period, and going to take a nap while he took the baby to his parents for birthday. \n\nYour husband should have offered that to begin with. \n\nAnd your in-laws ought to understand the situation and defend you to your husband.", "NTA.  You said  you didn't want to go, you are tired.  You need rest.  They insisted.  This is what happens.", "NTA. Newborns are rough to deal with", "The person not working gets the nights. Job search isn\u2019t that exhausting. NTA", "NTA", "NTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut your husband might be\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbabies are hard... he is making it harder", "Nta. Your husband though a huge one. Yeah the flu sucks but you're the one working and once he was feeling even a little bit better he should have started helping a bit more. He can't let you burn out and be out of work because you got sick.", "NTA \n\nJust... wow.", "NTA. Regardless of circumstances (even if you did not have a newborn), why should immediate family be offended by something as innocent as dozing off at a casual get together? It\u2019s not like you were snoring during someone\u2019s wedding.", "NTA. Omg, your husband is a jerk !", "NTA. I would try to go to your side of the family and ask for help. Maybe even some sleep. Then thank them on Facebook or whatever and say you finally got some respect and help.", "NTA\n\nbut i\u2019m confused\u2026 i thought your husband was sick?? why is he well enough to go to his parents for dinner but not well enough to mind his own child?", "About the only thing you did wrong was fall asleep in the dining room, should have gone to the guest bedroom. It is more restful.\n\nI recog ize you were trying to be there for your husband when he wanted you to be. \n\nThe body needs rest eventually.nta", "NTA my husband and I BOTH fell asleep at a Christmas dinner after being sleep deprived and then served lobster with a heart attack-inducing amount of butter. My family found it hilarious and took photos and then I assume kept arguing over politics and yelling about football. And we never had a baby!", "NTA. And, you both just completely changed your dynamic by having a baby and it takes some time to find your rhythm again. You\u2019re both gonna have moments where you say or do something that you\u2019d normally not (definitely not talking abusive behavior, but being more exhausted, short tempered, or forgetful) and should give grace and kindness where you can. \n\nNot excusing what he said at all, it was rude and a huge overreaction. Is he embarrassed by not having a job? Does he feel like he should be doing better/more and struggling with how to help and move forward? Again, not excusing behavior but I think you should pivot the conversation to what\u2019s below the surface and go from there. \n\nThe goal is for you guys to be a team and work through situations, apologize when necessary and figure out how to move forward. Don\u2019t get stuck on this moment. \n\nMight I suggest a nap together? A little time to bond and be together, catch up on rest and just be around each other in a positive way.", "NTA. I would have put a blanket on you and let you sleep. They\u2019re the assholes.", "NTA. As someone who falls asleep during inappropriate times despite my best efforts \u2026 no one wants to just fall asleep somewhere. You only do it because you can\u2019t help it.", "NTA. But I have to wonder. If you get the flu will your husband take all 8 days with the kid or he will expect you to keep doing what you always do?", "NTA. That\u2019s hilarious though, just snoozed out at the table. Here\u2019s a reminder to everyone who\u2019s not a new mom, you don\u2019t get to tell them how tired they are or are not.", "Poor woman, you were exhausted. The fact that you fell asleep were you were without planning it should get you a lot of compassion", "NTA \n\nSo wait. You went back to work a MONTH after you gave birth, before your body was anywhere near healed. Husband has no job. He got sick. So you were then working full time, while your mom watches your kid, only to get off work and care for the kid yourself, because he was sick. And HE is sleep deprived?! \n\nHonest question - who does all the housework? Cooking? Grocery shopping? Laundry? Takes baby to the Dr? \n\nHe had ALL day to rest, has no job to go to the next day and couldn't be bothered to take care of the kid at night so you could sleep? All while you're likely not even fully healed from a major medical event - especially since your body is not getting the rest it *needs*. \n\nYour husband sucks. You need to have a serious conversation about how unbalanced this work load is. Sick mom's manage to take care of their kids *all the time*.", "Nta also if your husband doesn't have a job right now why are you running back and forth with your child for your mom to watch them.", "NTA - You are new mom that fell asleep? good for you!", "NTA!!! \n\nYou carried a tiny human inside you for 9 months, you are now sleep deprived & have been taking on an extra load. It's unfortunate & I hope your husband finds work soon, good luck to him. But you're definitely not the AH. Mothers work really hard, & are often unappreciated. The sheer strain that it takes on your body is crazy. Nobody can function properly on 4 hours of sleep, especially when taking care of a baby AND working a lot. Seems like a lot of people expect the mother to be the main caretaker of their babies, when it really should be more split between both parents. \n\nI hope everything sorts itself out soon, do your best & hang in there!", "NTA but your husband is a major one. He can\u2019t expect you to be the breadwinner, full time parent, and social butterfly. The most considerate thing he could have done was going to his parents with the baby, so you could have a nice night of sleep", "NTA.\n\nAlso- if your daughter is with your mother during the days all the time, what is your husband doing? He needs to either get a job or pony up and care for his child.", "So the husband is too sick for childcare but well enough to socialize? NTA", "NTA. You are taking care of your entire household by yourself! Your husband is being super inconsiderate and thoughtless.", "THIS NTA. WTF is wrong with hubby here?  His parents were very understanding, so why is he throwing a fit?  You were in a no win situation, either not go and make your husband upset (because he wanted you to be there), or come and be tired and fall asleep and he's still upset with you.  No good deed goes unpunished. Tell him that his mommy and daddy understood and he's being an inconsiderate asshole.", "He's throwing a fit because his wife is so exhausted that she fell asleep (I'm presuming sitting up) and this is showcasing that HE is NOT doing his FAIR SHARE of parenting his child!!!!\n\n\nHE should be doing equal overnights, and after work caretaking, and I don't see why OPs mom is taking the baby while she's at work either.\n\n\nStay at home mothers still have to stay at home mom while *they're* sick, why can't he??? Is he somehow deficient???\n\n\nCertainly *looks* that way.\n\n\nAnd that's why he's mad.\n\n\nOP is NTA.", "100% this.\n\nIf a person's body is shutting down at places like the dinner table then CLEARLY they are beyond exhausted and need to lie down to rest. They do not need to be berated for a physical need.\n\nOP, I've been there. So tired I could barely keep my eyes open. So tired I couldn't participate in conversations. Colic was miserable and my husband traveled for work so it was 100% on me. NTA by a long shot. Just do not drive anywhere until you get sleep.", "Yes. And why doesn\u2019t he have a job? Any job? OP had to go back to work a month after giving birth.", "I hope he gets a job. She\u2019s out supporting the family AND doing baby care and he calls her out for falling asleep. He\u2019s a mega A H.", "This, exactly. There are no sick days with kids.\n\nHe's unemployed, got a little sick, then saw a chance to goof off until something came up he was willing to get out of bed for.", "Conditional manflu that gets the heebie jeebies from some Mommy-Approved TLC", "Honestly her husband suck. Op NTA.", "I think OP's mom only had the baby when the husband was sick for a week.\n\nIf parents have the option of not exposing their three months old to something as potentially dangerous as the flu, they should take it. Yes, some stay at home parents still have to take care of their children when the parent themself is sick, but if there's a solution that doesn't expose the baby to the sick parent, I feel it's reasonable to use that solution until the parent is well/not contagious.", "Nailed it!", "Exactly.  Did this once in my 20's.  Thank God no one was hurt, But it cost me a pickup and thousands of dollars in damages. And it was because I had worked 13 days straight of 12 hr shifts, while caring for my son once I was home.", "Would you say that about a mother who is not working if their husband had to do some extra around the house because they were sick? Or does being the stay at home parent only become the hardest job when it's the mother?", "lol \u201cmanflu\u201d", "I love your parents.  That is just so sweet!", "\ud83d\udcaf"]}
