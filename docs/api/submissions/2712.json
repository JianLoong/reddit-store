I have no children and get a healthy amount of sleep... I've still fallen asleep on my in laws couch once or twice while waiting for dinner!

The sheer strain that it takes on your body is crazy. Nobody can function properly on 4 hours of sleep, especially when taking care of a baby AND working a lot.

YOU WENT BACK TO WORK APROX FOUR WEEKS LATER !! \n\nBECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND DOESNT HAVE A JOB !?!?? \n\nYou\u2019re also doing every other night but because he\u2019s been sick you\u2019ve done EIGHT NIGHTS STRAIGHT WITH THE BABY AND GONE TO WORK.\n\nYet your husband is berating you because you\u2019re so exhausted you fell asleep somewhere you didn\u2019t even want to go to!?! \n\nNTA but your husband sure is.", "NTA, your husband sounds like the AH though\u2026", "Call your husband an AH for getting sick without consulting you", "NTA. He had 8 days to recover from flu, you were running on 8 days work and all night duty with a baby for him to get better. If MIL is on your side she needs to be louder and set her son straight on your behalf. You were not rude, you were exhausted. Something I doubt your husband has EVER been during your marriage and parenthood. Husband needs to get a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* job NOW.", "NTA", "NTA at all.  Your husband is.  You've been working a full-time job, responsible for taking baby to and from your mom's, and when home the last 8 days you've been the full-time parent, including staying up for 8 nights with little to no sleep.  Despite all of this,  he thinks you were rude to have fallen asleep at the in-laws.  Does he not understand human biology?\n\n**Solution:**  If he can't see your side, then I would say do this.  \n\n* Have him take your baby to your mother's and then come home to do housework for 8 hours . . . only breaking for lunch.  \n* Then, have him go pick up your baby and take care of her until the next morning when he needs to get her ready, to take her to your mothers.  \n* And, oh, if the baby is sleeping peacefully, tell your husband to let her do so, but he should set his own alarm to wake himself up every hour on the hour, so he does not get a good night's sleep.\n* Tell him to do this for five days, and when it gets to the weekend, he can just do five hours of housework.\n* Then, tell him at the end of 8 sleepless nights he has to go have a dinner with your parents.\n\nI wonder what his reaction will be?  I wonder if he will even go?  I wonder if he will be awake and delightful company?", "It\u2019s ok for you to work and watch baby? NTA, consider the value he adds to your life", "NTA. He\u2019s not working but because he is sick you have to get up at night with the baby? Oh your hubby is definitely T A. Parent here. You get up, change the diaper, feed the baby and put them back in the crib. Even when you are sick. ESPECIALLY when your partner has to work. It\u2019s called adulting. \nI could go on about his comment that it was rude to fall asleep but I think it\u2019s been sufficiently explained why he is also an A H here.", "Did anyone else see the kiddo is 3 months old and she went back to work 2 months ago??? \n\nShe's still healing, nevermind anything else. Hubs and inlaws can stick it, she needs some damn sleep", "He also didn\u2019t give birth and have to go right back to work.", "He's feeling like it's worth giving his parents that are probably in their late 50s to 60s the flu- in this, the year of our Lord 2022. You know, like a sensible adult who should be raising a child.", "Fucking America man. And the sad thing is that a month is generous for a lot of places here.", "Did you catch baby goes to her moms house while she works . Even though he is home all day.", "In my country, you're not legally allowed back into the workplace at 1 month postpartum unless you work for yourself! Companies will not allow you back into their building in a working capacity because legally, they'd be hung, drawn and quartered by the government legislation if they were found out!", "Honestly most parents (me included) will call it \"magic\" can't even explain how we do it ourselves. Besides a big ton of caffeine lol.", "Agree. Unless it\u2019s her day off. He should be doing ALL nighttime childcare", "I know... lol\n\nI meant that his manflu virus was scared of his momma when she came on the scene to pamper her poor baby\n\nI hope that clears things up", "That\u2019s much worse. Then they shouldnt do 50/50 at night if baby goes to grandmas while she works. \n\nHe should be doing all night time care . Unless it\u2019s weekends she doesn\u2019t work", "THIS. \n\nNights\u2026 and days. That\u2019s what SAHMs do and so can he.", "Only the flu you do realise that the flu kills thousands of healthy people a year. Or do you think they died because they were to lazy to recover. OP isn't TA but you sure are.", "NTA but your husband is +++", "It sounds like you had a moment where you could relax. When in doubt, rack out. Get that sleep when you can. NTA", "omg NTA. Your husband's take on this is weird. Sounds like it will be good for him to find a job again and realise what it's like to be working full time and up most of the night with a sick baby for a bunch nights.", "NTA \n\nYour husband is TA for coercing your attendance when you were sleep deprived.", "Your husband is ridiculous. Your in laws are family, they should be understanding and supportive. Rude? No! It\u2019s called exhaustion! \nNTA", "Nta", "NTA. It happens and I would think your husband and his parents should be a little more understanding of that. New baby exhaustion is for real!", "OP=NTA  Husband BIG A-H\n\nPeople do not CHOOSE to fall asleep sitting up in a dining room.", "NTA - it wasn\u2019t intentional. Your body is literally shutting down. that\u2019s how tired you are. Don\u2019t feel like an AH for that. Your husband is the AH!", "NTA. Poor mommy. Sleep is such a highly prized commodity during the first year of baby\u2019s life. Fall asleep where you and tell your husband to piss off. Better yet, tell him to hire a care giver for a couple of nights so you can both sleep!! Good luck, sweetie.", "Seriously not the AH, AT ALL! You are a sleep deprived new mom who has been doing it all with what sounds like little assistance. They are serious AHs if they make you feel bad about being exhausted instead of trying to help.", "NTA\u2026 my family would have taken the baby and told me to eat and go to sleep (I have a 4 month old).", "Nta. You\u2019re not the asshole, but you can see one from where you are. I hope your husband has some redeeming qualities, because he\u2019s going to have to make an effort to break even on this one. What a knob.", "Husband is such a AH. He needs to get a grip. Wtf. You\u2019re literally getting no sleep working and taking care of your kid and he has the audacity to get mad over a freaking birthday party. Pleaseeeeeee Mother in law needs to shut up and get her son together as well. Stop making excuses for him", "NTA. Your husband should have worked to let you sleep a little more, as much as possible during the visit. And then a gentle \"honey honey\", it's time for dinner now. Have dinner and tell parents that obviously OP is tired so they'll be leaving early.\n\nWith a 3-month old this would be completely understandable and expected. \n\nThat hubby did not protect you... He's the AH.", "NTA if you come to any family function of mine expect to see people asleep. It doesn't matter if it's noon or midnight at least one person will be asleep.", "NTA. Tell your husband that if he wants to know who the AH is, all he has to do is look in the mirror.", "NTA- I fell asleep constantly when my son was younger and still do on occasion randomly", "They were the assholes for insisting that you go .", "NTA. I will maybe give your husband a little compassion because he is also sleep deprived and was just getting over being sick, and it was his birthday. But not enough to say he isn't being a  big ah for treating you this way. You're fucking exhausted, and rightfully so. And you only gave birth three months ago, and went back to work a month later? Oh honey, I'm so sorry. That is really, really hard. Take all the naps you can get.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a machine!", "Husband is a AH", "NTA\n\nYou guys need to work out some better scheduling for rest! Your well-being matters too.\n\nAnd A LOT of people are assuming OP is the birther and/or female. Not that it changes the situation but just a reminder for others to be more mindful when making comments about postpartum and whatnot.", "NTA", "NTA. You have a newborn.", "NTA. Your husband is an idiot.", "NTA!  \n\nSleep deprivation causes SO MANY more issues than people realize!  Usually, the brain goes through a systematic process between being awake and falling asleep.  It usually takes at least 10-15 minutes for a normal person to fall asleep, and most of the time, they can recognize if it\u2019s happening at an inappropriate time.  But significant sleep deprivation can cause this 10-15 minute process to happen in just a few seconds.  You literally can\u2019t recognize it\u2019s happening.  But sleep deprivation also causes major deficiencies in decision making, meaning that even if you COULD recognize you\u2019re falling asleep, you probably can\u2019t make a decision to go lay down in the living room.  \n\nHe\u2019s literally mad at you for a condition of basic biology/neurology for which HE\u2019S responsible.  You said \u2018no\u2019 to dinner, you\u2019re too exhausted.  He said, \u2018please prioritize my parents over your bodily well-being.\u2019  And you did. This is the predictable outcome.", "NTA. Tired people fall asleep, and new parents are tired people. Husband is an epic AH.", "NTA. You\u2019re working and raising a child. He\u2019s out of work and he\u2019s got man flu. He should be ever so freaking thankful you pulled everything together while he did nothing.", "You\u2019re not the asshole but you\u2019re certainly married to one.", "NTA it's common enough at my family gatherings for at least one person to doze off while the dinner is being made. People get tired and need sleep. The right thing to do is leave them be or even toss a blanket over them.", "Nta. Why are you doing every other night/day when he isn't working?? And omg, of course your exhausted. He needs to let you get more sleep. Esp when you are the only one working. My husband has fallen asleep every single time he has been to my parents (if he sits down). No one finds it offensive. My mom used to make me go get him a blanket.", "\"they complained it\u2019d be the last time they\u2019d see us till after Christmas\"\n\nThey were not understanding. Clearly the reason hubby has no empathy is because his parents failed to teach him anything but \"BUT I WANT!!!\"", "I (M) was working but I got almost all nights anyway to let my wife sleep since she was taking care of the new one during the day and had to recuperate. \nThe baby goes to the grandmother, what does the dad do ?!?", "Good that MIL had her side atleast.\n\nI would not have been able to count the number of places I feel asleep in when they kids where young. (MILs couch was a favorite place) My husband used to fall asleep in the lunch room at work. Are you even a parent if you've never just dozed of? \ud83e\udd14", "Sounds like your parents know the importance of making home into a sanctuary and safe space", "NTA.  You are sleep deprived.", "I don't have a kid but I've fallen asleep at my in-laws after a big meal. They're Italian and make the best pasta and sauce. I'd be full with pasta and red wine, go up to my hubby's old room and pass out. No one, not even my husband, cared.", "NTA. I see a lot of people calling your husband TA. But I suspect he is probably sleep deprived as well? I don't have kids but it sounds really hard.", "NTA but your husband is.", "NTA but your husband is", "NTA and pls don't drive if you're so sleep deprived. If you have family who can help you during the weekends try to catch up on sleep.", "NTA. I guarantee you that I'm gonna nap wherever tf I feel like during Thanksgiving. Dinner table, couch, veranda. Idgaf and neither should you.", "NTA - This is a ridiculous argument. Your husband is the one being TA and making you drive to a dinner while you are sleep deprived. What if you fell asleep at the wheel?!", "NTA. You\u2019re a new mother, working full-time, and he\u2019s upset that you would ever sleep? Red flags for the unemployed dad who has zero compassion for his working wife that never sleeps.", "Nta. Hopefully you didn't take this nonsense from him.", "NTA.\n\nI actually have warm memories of when my uncle, a medical resident, would accidentally fall asleep on the couch or in a chair at my grandparents' house during a big family dinner. I'd be sent with a blanket to tuck him in. Family should be a place where you take care of each other, not judge each other for being a human being with normal needs for rest and sleep.", "NTA. Please tell your hubby... *It was incredibly rude of YOU to lose your job and have a week-long flu so that I have to earn the money and care for our baby. What? You said that wasn't in your control? Before this moment, did you hear me complain to you it being rude of you? I'm EXHAUSTED from working and caring for the baby so that YOU can recover. You have enough energy to celebrate your birthday at your mom's because you are so well rested from having me do your job and mine for the past week. But you can't see that it wasn't in my control to be so dang exhausted for carrying the load for both of us. You feel perfectly fine in calling me rude for being that exhausted?!? You think having maybe 4 hours of sleep a night for a week means nothing, that I should just will my body to stay awake so that I can sing Happy Birthday to you? Where is your care and compassion for me as a human being?*", "NTA. If I fell asleep at my inlaws, they would cover me with a blanket and save me a plate of food, and I don't have  a newborn. This is one of those instances when you don't have a choice. Newborn- sleep deprivation-comfy couch. It was bound to happen. Husband needs to chill.", "NTA hubby is. Christ your carrying the  whole family and still not allowed to get tired? He should try it", "NTA. It's not rude to succumb to exhaustion. What's rude is to take offense when it was a command performance to begin with.", "NTA, sorry you are so exhausted. I'm assuming you didn't mean to so just say sorry and both let it go. Your baby doesn't need to feel the tension about it.", "NTA.\n\nHopefully your husband is only temporarily deprived of reason. You are a tired parent who fell asleep. This shouldn't even be an argument.", "Buddy has the flu and thinks the world should revolve around him? What happens when you get the flu? He feels good enough to go out and visit family for his big day but cant get out of bed to help with your kid for a few hours? Doesnt he have the rest of the day to sleep while youre at work and the kid is elsewhere? And you warned him you were exhausted so did he think you were kidding? \n\nNta", "So he\u2019s \u201ctoo sick\u201d to care for baby making wife pull double shifts but fine to go to party?", "NTA.  **Sleep deprivation is serious stuff.  You needed sleep,** so you fell asleep.  Better there than on the road.  \n\n**Maybe if all the other adults, him and his parents, had respected that your need for sleep was more important than a party, and let you stay home and sleep, this wouldn't have happened.**  Maybe they could have changed the plans, based on how you had had sickness at your house on top of having a new baby, and instead of having a party where the two of you had to go there, they could have dropped off a meal, stayed for fifteen minutes of present and cake, and left, so you could sleep at home, recuperate from being the only one doing nights while he was sick, and husband could take care of things now that he's not sick.\n\nParties are great.  Grandkids are great.  But **the needs** of my kids and grandkids **come first, before my wants** as a parent and grandparent.  Even on my kids' birthdays, even on mine.\n\n**You are being blamed for what isn't your fault.**  Your need for sleep was extreme, and was not being noticed or respected by **the people in your life who ought to have been taking care of you.  They, all three, are the ones who deserve the sub name here, not you.**", "NTA!!! As a mom of a 12 weeker, I can say he\u2019s lucky because I would have chewed him out so bad (and then some) for trying to make you feel sorry for falling asleep. I\u2019m angry on your behalf!", "NTA, but sounds like you have 2 babies.  Husband needs to grow up and realize that humans need to sleep, especially new mothers.", "NTA. Sleep deprivation is serious. He should\u2019ve let you sleep", "NTA. I have a young one (8 months) and even before babies, I've fallen asleep mid conversation with my MIL/FIL. They took it very well, we still laugh about it and it was like.... Ten years ago. They know that it happens.", "I hate to defend a husband on here and have everyone pile onto me, but we don't know how late into the flu he was. He could have been over it by the time his mother threw the party.\n\nETA: NTA by the way. I do agree with your MIL that the living room might have been a better place to fall asleep, but when it happens it happens. Especially when you've been taking care of a baby by yourself for so long and working on top of that. And honestly? The thought of someone falling asleep in the dining room does give me a little chuckle. Good luck with the new baby!", "When one of my kids was a newborn, just home from the NICU, we were so exhausted from the combination of pump/nurse/feed, extra care that she needed, and our other toddlers, one night both of us were sitting in the living room, my husband was holding her, and we fell asleep. I woke up and saw her laying on the floor. She was completely fine and our dog probably would have barked if she'd fallen and made a crashing noise, so I don't think he dropped her. I think half-awake, he set her on the floor to avoid dropping her. Neither one of us remembered ANYTHING though. It was terrifying. I have never been one to get drunk or high, but newborn induced sleep deprivation can get you to blackout state just as easily. After that we instituted a \"shift\" rule so it wouldn't happen again.", "I, too, fell asleep while pregnant with number 2, during Dora the Explorer \ud83d\ude02.", "Then if he was over it, why didn\u2019t he relieve OP by letting her sleep in, or take baby and leave her home?", "OP could have fallen asleep on the dining room table for all I care. Shame on all of them. OP is def NTA, but hubby and his family are.\n\n   -signed, mom with a newborn, as well", "He definitely could have relieved her and should have let her stay at home to get some rest if he was feeling better so he's definitely an AH for that. But like I said we don't know how late into it he was. A day or two over the flu still sucks.", "The village is there\u2014take a catnap \ud83d\ude3d", "I\u2019ve fallen asleep on MIL\u2019s bed. Oops. Nobody seemed to care."]}
