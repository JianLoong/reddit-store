Life with a newborn is not easy and you had declined to go in the first place but he insisted.", "NTA. Oh, hell no!  If your husband doesn't understand this level of exhaustion, sounds like he could be pulling a few more night shifts with your baby.", "NTA - you're tired you didn't want to go you expressed that. \n\nIt's your in-laws who cares that you fell asleep I don't feel that's rude at all.\n\nFalling asleep in the dining room obviously wasn't intentional,  If you wanted to sleep you would have gone to the living room or a bedroom. \n\nYour husband's the AH", "Definitely NTA - falling asleep in the dining room is not rude, it's the consequence of making you attend a celebration while you are overworked and sleep deprived. That being said your husband is the AH. Does he know that his flu ist the reason you are this exhausted? Not his fault he got the flu, but his fault he's been a wanker here.", "NTA, your husband is incredibly rude. Tell him not to get sick so you can sleep.", "NTA but hubby is. No doubt he's well rested and wants to party while you worked yourself ragged and need to rest.  He needs a job.", "NTA - a new mother working full time with no sleep is going to fall asleep.  Obviously the dining room is not the most ideal place, but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH.  It makes you a sleep deprived mother.", "NTA, and anyone that agrees with your husband obviously doesn\u2019t have kids.", ">his mother has my side but still says I should\u2019ve gone to the living room.\n\nGeez. Does anyone in your husband's family have, like, a soul?\n\nNTA", "NTA I recommend that both of you do whatever is in your power to get the rest you need then come back to this issue. If you have the power to take a mental health day, I would recommend it. Your husband does not have the right to make you feel like shit for sleeping. \n\nListen, no one in this world is going to take care of you like you can take care of yourself. The world has a tendency to push and cajole and guilt women into doing shit that we don't want to do or are too overwhelmed to take on. You are the only person who can say no, who can put up those boundaries to protect your health and wellbeing. If you do not learn how to disappoint others to take care of yourself, you will run yourself ragged. You are a human and you deserve rest. And, honestly, if you don't take the time to get the sleep you need, the sleep you need will take up your time when you least want or expect it... Like falling asleep in the dining room at your husband's birthday party.", "NTA you're sleep deprived and working, he's sleep deprived and recovering from not feeling well. It's one of those things that gets made into a big deal because everyone is just done.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not as if you fell asleep deliberately. Having a newborn demonstrated to me why lack of sleep is a torture. \n\nI once fell asleep while teaching a class (very strong painkillers for a slipped disc) and no one was mean. You and your husband are sleep deprived and he's been ill, so it's not surprising you're arguing about something like this.", "NTA. Having an infant is just about as close as you can get to experiencing narcolepsy without actually having narcolepsy. Sometimes there\u2019s just no amount of effort that can keep you awake. Sleep deprivation is a torture technique for a reason.\n\nI get your husband is also sleep deprived but saying you didn\u2019t put enough effort into staying awake after pressuring you to attend is what pushes him into AH territory. His mother should have kept her comment to herself, or she can volunteer to take over nighttime baby duty.", "NTA and I honestly would be more worried that my partner or my Dil is so tired that she falls asleep. I don't know your mil and FIL situation but I feel like they should have offered to babysit after that situation instead of blaming you. And shame on your husband!", "NTA frankly he should be doing every night since you work full-time and he dares to criticize you for falling asleep what a piece of work he is. I hope you don't have plans for more children with this man.", "NTA. You fell asleep by accident after already trying to back out of attending due to being sleep deprived. Husband shouldn't have pressured you to go if he was going to criticize what happens next.", "NTA.  If you are that tired then he should have realized that you need some help, instead he acted like an AH and so did his mother.", "NTA at all. Your husband is completely unrealistic in his expectations of you, especially with a newborn. He needs to do all the night feeds for 8 days, plus work, and see how well he can stay awake.", "NTA. Ffs why can\u2019t people understand the body is talking to others even when it\u2019s asleep? When you\u2019re that tired, you\u2019ll crash as soon as you\u2019re able. \n\nI\u2019d expect to hear, \u201cWow, she must be exhausted, fetch her a throw while she catches a power nap.\u201d", "NTA when he gives birth he can complain. That shit has you tired for YEARS", "N T A.  You're sleeping deprived.  It's not his fault he got sick but you're working (stress of one income) then all that lack of sleep?  If you don't nap, you might fall into a dangerous mental state.  This is more important than birthdays, holidays or any thing else.\n\nShow him these comments so he can knock it off and put you and his IMMEDIATE family first AND NOT HIMSELF", "NTA. Your husband and his family are though.", " As an insomniac, I firmly believe that if you are falling asleep, it is because you are not getting the sleep you NEED.  You don\u2019t just fall asleep to be rude, it is because your BODY needs it.\n\nYou tried to stay home, he whined.  He prioritized his WANTS over your NEEDS. \n\nYou are NTA.  Listen to MIL - Mama knows best (sometimes).", "To this day, I've never been so tired as I was back when I had a newborn. That is a level of exhaustion unmatched by anything else I've ever experienced.\n\nNTA. \n\nMy husband falls asleep everywhere and anywhere and my family just thinks it's hilarious. It's kinda weird they're making this a whole thing, especially under the circumstances.", "NTA.  His whole side of the family sounds insane.  He's pushing you to go when he knows you are over-loaded.  His mom making the inane comment that when your body finally gave up, you should have sleep-walked to the living room?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You tried not to go. DH vetoed it. You said mom is taking care of baby during the day (?) (is this every day?). And Hubby gets up half the week. Seems to me if he is home during the day and is alone, he can take more than half the nights.", "NTA. Honestly I'm horrified, your husband is so well rested he has the energy to make plans and disrespect you, and you're so exhausted you're falling asleep even in uncomfortable places.\n\nHe is not being a good partner, and his parents are absolutely assholes for trying to turn this around on you and say that you're wrong for falling asleep while sitting. The lack of empathy for you here is astonishing", "NTA... Sounds like he needs to be doing some night shifts with the baby all by himself for a few nights. I'd say eight", "NTA you have a 3 month old infant, you are already back to work, and you carried his slack while he was sick (for 8 days!!?), resulting in zero sleep. \n\nAlso while you should obviously help out at night, if you are working why are you still alternating this way? He can nap when baby naps; you can\u2019t. AND your mom takes baby several days a week?", "NTA. His parents are your family now, you fell asleep at a family dinner, it's ok. His parents are not some sort of royalty. I think you both need some rest and in the meantime your husband and yourself need to realize that some conflicts are not worth having.", "NTA. You should have stayed home and rested. Your husband is doubly an AH for pressuring you to go.", "Exactly! NTA", "If he's not working, HE gets more nights with baby.", "NTA", "And they're also assholes.", "Or while driving.", "Hes also not working, right?\nEnd of discussion.", "Right?  It literally takes months to truly heal from pregnancy and birth. \n\nOP went back to work what a month after having a baby? And this dude thinks she should take 50% of nights? Sure, help with a diaper change or a feeling here and there but he isn\u2019t working. He can nap when baby naps. She\u2019s healing and working. \n\nAND baby is at her moms several days a week \n\nThis is not 50/50"]}
