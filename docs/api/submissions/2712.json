That being said your husband is the AH. Does he know that his flu ist the reason you are this exhausted? Not his fault he got the flu, but his fault he's been a wanker here.", "NTA, your husband is incredibly rude. Tell him not to get sick so you can sleep.", "NTA but hubby is.

If you have the power to take a mental health day, I would recommend it. Your husband does not have the right to make you feel like shit for sleeping. \n\nListen, no one in this world is going to take care of you like you can take care of yourself. The world has a tendency to push and cajole and guilt women into doing shit that we don't want to do or are too overwhelmed to take on. You are the only person who can say no, who can put up those boundaries to protect your health and wellbeing. If you do not learn how to disappoint others to take care of yourself, you will run yourself ragged. You are a human and you deserve rest.

Having an infant is just about as close as you can get to experiencing narcolepsy without actually having narcolepsy. Sometimes there\u2019s just no amount of effort that can keep you awake. Sleep deprivation is a torture technique for a reason.\n\nI get your husband is also sleep deprived but saying you didn\u2019t put enough effort into staying awake after pressuring you to attend is what pushes him into AH territory. His mother should have kept her comment to herself, or she can volunteer to take over nighttime baby duty.", "NTA and I honestly would be more worried that my partner or my Dil is so tired that she falls asleep.

I hope you don't have plans for more children with this man.", "NTA. You fell asleep by accident after already trying to back out of attending due to being sleep deprived. Husband shouldn't have pressured you to go if he was going to criticize what happens next.", "NTA.  If you are that tired then he should have realized that you need some help, instead he acted like an AH and so did his mother.", "NTA at all. Your husband is completely unrealistic in his expectations of you, especially with a newborn. He needs to do all the night feeds for 8 days, plus work, and see how well he can stay awake.", "NTA. Ffs why can\u2019t people understand the body is talking to others even when it\u2019s asleep?
