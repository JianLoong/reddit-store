My ex later remarried and moved to a different State. I had visitation and I tried my best to stay in my daughter's life but eventually she just didn't want to spend time with me. She had a good life with her mom and stepdad.  I paid child support and sent gifts at Christmas time and birthdays. If she needed money for anything I would give it.  \n\nI met my current wife 28 about five years ago. We were friends for a few years before she told me how she felt.  We had known each other so long our engagement was very short. We were engaged, married, and expecting our son in one year.  \n\nMy daughter is now 25 and engaged. My parents asked me about my plans for the wedding and I didn't have any answers because I didn't know about it.  I called my ex to find out what was up.  She said that her husband was paying for everything and would be walking my daughter down the aisle.  \n\nI was hurt. But I understood that my adult daughter had made her choice in life.  So I thanked her mom for making sure my parents got an invitation.  Then I went back to my life.  I have a newborn that needs my attention.  \n\nWell I have been hearing from her family now. Apparently I'm the asshole who doesn't even care that in not invited to my daughter's wedding.  \n\nThat's not entirely true. I chose not to make a big deal about it because I don't want to cause drama over a wedding.  \n\nBut now my ex in-laws are all on me about not attending. And now my daughter is on social media saying how I abandoned her and am not even making the effort to come because I only care about my \"replacement\" family.  \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit.  \n\nMy daughter, her mom and stepdad came to my wedding.  \n\nWhen I say I made an effort I mean I paid for her phone so we could talk.  When she got herself a new phone she changed her number and didn't bother giving me the new number. \n\nI took my vacation time in the summer so I could see her.  \n\nI would make long weekends with my PTO so I could drive 400 miles or more to see her cheer competitions. Or just to spend a weekend with her.  \n\nI didn't fight when her mom wanted to move to another state with her new husband because he had a good job waiting there.

She never gave it to me.", "You need help.", "I didn't earn enough. I have a better career now and do okay.", "He wasnt invited, and his daughter stopped talking to him.\nHow is this his fault", "Yesss, exactly what I thought. Like I wonder why he isn't invited to the wedding", "Yes! Usually age gaps are acutely frowned upon in AITA, so why is no one noticing it?", "Yes! I don\u2019t understand how no one is noticing that there\u2019s only 3 years difference between them. He said they married quickly bc he\u2019s known her for a long time. Did that long time start when she was still a minor? \ud83e\udd22", "Yes, this is definitely my thinking on this one. Like, you are nta for this specific situation, but other times? Most likely you were in other ways", "I agree with you. The daughter decided not to invite him. It\u2019s her wedding and her right to do so. She choose her stepdad to walk her down the aisle. She can\u2019t now play the victim and cry about it as it was her own decision. He was hurt by it but choose to respect her decision. He even called to ask what\u2019s going on.\n\nNTA", "Yes, this. \n\nAlso did I read correctly that his current wife is 28, and his daughter is 25?  He said he\u2019s known new wife for a long while so did they possibly meet when she was still a minor? And maybe friends with his daughter? \ud83e\udd22", "Wish I could upvote this more than once, I think you said it perfectly.", "Yeah I know.", "Yes. She came.", "Most sane comment on this thread.", "I think what you said is fair but the question is AITA for not attending daughter's wedding? No he is not. He didn't get an invite, reached out for some explanation, got it, understood it and went about his way. If he did say he is the father, needs to attend and etc, he would automatically be the A-hole for causing drama. So it's a lose lose scenario for him either way. \n\nNow he's getting hate for not going when he didn't get an invite. His daughter didn't invite him but she is going on social media ripping him that he doesn't care to try to attend? Like really? How does that work? \n\nAlso he just met his wife a few years ago so there is no step mom drama. \n\nI understand that he might Y T A for what happened years ago perhaps for not trying hard (which we have no info about and is irrelevant to the post) but NTA for the post in hand.", "This is valid. There probably is a lot missing. My older children's father pulls this your of thing frequently. \"I did my best\" meanwhile he's put almost zero effort into being in their lives. I made no obstacles for him and openly welcomed him in our lives. Through his own actions visits became more difficult for him and I was blamed for the lack of time spent together.", "I added an edit", "So much detail missing! And yet he did include detail about the 20 year age gap between him and wife number two..", "He actually didn't specifically state he wasn't invited either did he?", "That math is about right.  I dated women my own age for most of my life since my divorce.  My wife and I were friends like I said.  She was way too young when we met and was going through a divorce of her own. She eventually wore me down.", "Well put.  They were probably expecting him to sob and cry publicly about it.", "I was not invited.", "I was not sent an invitation. I would have loved to attend as a guest.", "With out that information, how can you see he's TA.  He wasn't invited.  She hasn't involved him in her life despite his efforts.", "You know it takes 2 to build a relationship right? Otherwise it's called harassment.", "Clear how? He made the effort and eventually his daughter chose to not see him.", "Sounds like some passive aggressive BS too.  She doesn't invite him then gets mad that he didn't argue with her about it and beg to be invited.", "Then definitely NTA. She should have invited you. Do not feel bad at all. You can call her, talk to her, maybe she just need a bit of attention.", "Did you ask her?", "Did you ask for it?", "Oh then I think she felt neglected.  Try talking with her and see if it's a relationship you can mend trying doesn't cost anything", "Because he didn't fight and he's not fighting. He just accepted everything and moved on.", "I dont even want to think about this part. He did say something along the lines of her being too young but eventually \"wore him down\" and honestly I don't have a big enough puke bucket.", "Here's what I think she wanted:\n\n1. Biodad finds out he's not invited\n2. Biodad calls her to find out why\n3. She gets to unload years of frustration and feelings she'd been \"abandoned\"\n4. Biodad apologizes through tears, recognizes where he went wrong, and begs to come to the wedding\n5. She feels validated, and makes sure to let Biodad know that she always wanted him to make the effort, and invites him to the wedding (without the new wife)\n6. For next few weeks, Biodad is on tenterhooks wondering if invitation will be pulled for some failure to do/communicate during this period\n7. Biodad comes to wedding, though will not walk her down the aisle, bride is validated and gets to show Biodad who REALLY brought her up\n\nMy folks aren't divorced, so I don't know what a divorced child would feel given your lack of presence in her life. But the above is what I think her fantasy was.", "ESH. I think the point here is you aren\u2019t close enough to your own daughter to even know she\u2019s getting married. \n\nShe\u2019s also the asshole for turning her wedding invites into a test of your attention. But she did quickly find out you don\u2019t pay any attn to her.", "He didn't reach out to the daughter though. He didn't have to call her in an angry way and demand an invitation, but he could have called and said I heard you're getting married. I'm going to go reread it to see if the daughter was included in his second marriage or child.", "I think OP is the AH for not caring. OP definitely should not attend. But for me, the attitude as well as past lack of care makes it YTA.", ">My daughter is now 25 and engaged. My parents asked me about my plans for the wedding and I didn't have any answers because I didn't know about it.\n\nHe does say he didn't know about the wedding- which implies not receiving an invite; but you're right he doesn't out right say he wasn't invited.", "Ew.", "I absolutely agree and I personally wouldn\u2019t be playing in her games.\nSaying he abandoned her and the rest of her rubbish when her mum has remarried too so I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s acceptable for 1 parent but not both.\nShe just needs to grow up.", "Like an adult should in this situation? This isn\u2019t middle school or a tv show, kicking up a storm wouldve been a worse reaction because her decision should be respected, and it was. Granted, op could be the ah in other ways to his daughter that we don\u2019t know about, but in this situation he reacted appropriately imo", "But if he did fight he'd be causing drama for his daughter. Maybe he could have called daughter directly and congratulated her on the wedding and explained that he understood but that sounds painful.\nEdit: I still think he's the AH here. There's obviously much more to this story than the woe is me version he's giving us", "This feels like something out of a Hallmark movie would be. You should write. This is actually really good and the breakdown of each scene too.", "This reads like a reddit fanfic. I can buy it. He's NTA", "It's a little hard to be close with someone who's in another state and doesn't want to be close with you", "Yeah I don't think he mentioned he called the daughter. He called his ex wife to get info about the wedding and got what he needed. Perhaps he did or did not after. Maybe the daughter is low to NC with OP. Missing info.", "Fair enough. Have a good day :)", "\"Wore him down.\" This guy needs to look up what taking responsibility means.", "But this is not about the wedding. She's pissed about everything else that happened before.\n\nThe wedding is just the latest thing on a very long list of being disappointed by her father (and I think the list include her father marrying a woman only 3 years older than her, not being invited to his wedding and him not calling to tell her she was going to have a brother).", "Hey! You're not supposed to say mean shit like that in this sub. Stay civil and don't call people terrible things like Hallmark movie \"writers\"", "And where did you got all this info?", "I don\u2019t disagree with you on this is something thats built up over time, but the question was is op an ah for not doing anything about not being invited, which, he is nta for that specific question", "I didn't? I actually liked that fantasy. Maybe it came out wrongly through my comment. I apologize \ud83d\ude22\n\nEdit: I just realized you're being sarcastic...or not. My brain is too tired for this lol", "OP said his wife is 28 and his daughter 25.\n\nHe also said that from the moment his daughter decided not to come and see him anymore, he would pay CS and send gifts for Christmas and Birthdays. Seen as he can't even call her to talk about her wedding, I'm guessing he never called to tell her about his or about his precious newborn.", "Op also said she changed her phone number without giving him the new one."]}
