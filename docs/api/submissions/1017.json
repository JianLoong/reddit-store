She had a good life with her mom and stepdad.  I paid child support and sent gifts at Christmas time and birthdays. If she needed money for anything I would give it.  \n\nI met my current wife 28 about five years ago. We were friends for a few years before she told me how she felt.  We had known each other so long our engagement was very short. We were engaged, married, and expecting our son in one year.  \n\nMy daughter is now 25 and engaged. My parents asked me about my plans for the wedding and I didn't have any answers because I didn't know about it.  I called my ex to find out what was up.  She said that her husband was paying for everything and would be walking my daughter down the aisle.  \n\nI was hurt. But I understood that my adult daughter had made her choice in life.  So I thanked her mom for making sure my parents got an invitation.  Then I went back to my life.  I have a newborn that needs my attention.  \n\nWell I have been hearing from her family now. Apparently I'm the asshole who doesn't even care that in not invited to my daughter's wedding.  \n\nThat's not entirely true. I chose not to make a big deal about it because I don't want to cause drama over a wedding.  \n\nBut now my ex in-laws are all on me about not attending. And now my daughter is on social media saying how I abandoned her and am not even making the effort to come because I only care about my \"replacement\" family.  \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit.  \n\nMy daughter, her mom and stepdad came to my wedding.  \n\nWhen I say I made an effort I mean I paid for her phone so we could talk.  When she got herself a new phone she changed her number and didn't bother giving me the new number. \n\nI took my vacation time in the summer so I could see her.  \n\nI would make long weekends with my PTO so I could drive 400 miles or more to see her cheer competitions.

She still cares about you and wants your validation but feels like she can\u2019t talk to you about it and instead is resorting to (although childish) methods like this to see how you\u2019ll respond.

At this point, you are not responsible for her emotional regulation.", "NTA, but call your daughter.  Ask her what she would have wanted you to do?

Let her know that yes, you were hurt, not only that you weren't invited but also that she didn't ask you to walk her down the aisle.  Let her know that she is acting extremely entitled and narcissistic in blaming you for following her wants concerning her wedding and that you really have better things to do than hear from your ex-in-laws that he was a terrible father for not attending her wedding that you had not been invited to.

First off, if I didn\u2019t get invited for something, I don\u2019t go. No need for drama. You sir, is a good man.", "I would say NTA and I am sorry your daughter stopped caring enough for you to let you lnow she was getting married.  My husband has a friend with 2 daughters.  They were very young when his wife decided she didn't want to be married any longer and filed for divorce.  She moved the kids over 1000 away.  He didn't fight her - she was a good mom and was moving closer to her family.  He paid his child support on time and often paid more than ordered, if he had the money.  He sent gifts and called every week.  He had the girls for 2 months every summer and made sure they did things like the zoo and going on hikes, going to concerts, etc.   \n\nWhen each girl turned 16, they stopped coming for their summer visits.  They wouldn't talk to him on the phone.  His ex said she couldn't force them and he let it go.  He talked to his in-laws who told him his ex had remarried and new \"dad\" was a much better man, and to just leave the girls slobe.  They didnt need him any longer.  He still sent birthday cards and Christmas gifts, but gradually stopped trying to reach out.  Things were silent until the youngest started college.  She sent him a bill for her tuition and he sent it back with a letter telling her that he hadn't heard from her in 7 years.  He had sent cards and gifts with no acknowledgement from the girls.  He had sent money for them for sports and extracurriculars with no acknowledgement from them.  Thus he continued to pay the court-ordered child support but now she was 18 and he was done.  He had made his last payment and washing his hands of them.  Their new \"dad\" could fund their college.\n\nAt first, everyone was ticked at him for abandoning his kids like that, but then as more of the story came out, opinions changed.  New dad bought the girls new phones and changed their numbers, not giving them to dad. The only number dad had was ex-wife's and she eventually stopped answering his calls and texts.  He drove to their home, several times to see the girls but they wouldn't talk to him.  New dad finally told him he would call the cops on him if he returned.  He talked to his lawyer who told him he could make a complaint that the visitation schedule wasn't being followed but he was afraid that his ex would take him back to court and have the girls say they wanted nothing to do with him. He didn't want to close that door yet.  Really, he did everything he could to be in their lives under the circumstances.  \n\nIn hindsight, he could have moved near them when his ex left, and probably have been a more constant presence in his kids lives.  However, his job didn't have an office near there to transfer to.  He would have been moving without a job into an area with few jobs at a time when it was hard to find a job.  He would have still been required to pay child support during that time with no means to do it. \n\nSo what's the solution?  OP doesn't hear from his daughter that she is getting married and he's at fault for not psychically knowing she wants him there, but didn't invite him?  Play stupid games win stupid prizes.  Then to blame it on his \"new family\" is a cop out on her part.  She is an adult and is every bit as able to pick upba phone and call/text her dad, stop by and see him or write a letter to him.  But she did not.  So he is automatically at fault because he is the parent? I don't think so.  Communication is a teo-way street between adults and it sounds like daughter thinks the street is a one-way street", "\"You are not invited, I don't consider you as my father and I don't feel close to you at all.  \n\\- ok, fair enough... that hurts but I understand.

I thought about it and realized that she was the reason I hadn't been bout with another woman in six months.  So we got together.  Then we realized how well we work and just went for it. She will be 29 in a couple of weeks. We were having dinner because neither of us had Thanksgiving plans.", "They were married within two months of dating, engaged after one. So it *could* work out: first date was possibly for her 28th bday or shortly after. They\u2019re married two months later. She gets pregnant with a honeymoon baby (or was already pregnant when they married), baby is born last month and she\u2019s about to turn 29", "He met his wife when she was 23, she's 28 now.

For anyone who watched a child grow up with an uninvolved father ops dad sounds like a dream. And he respected her decision without a guilt trip.

It sounds like most of their communication when she was a kid was through phone. It's not necessarily OP's fault but the daughter is not some kind of ungrateful brat for not having a father-daughter relationship with someone she spoke on the phone to and barely saw as a kid (again, not OP's fault).\n\nMaintaining communication as adults sure, but the three year old wasn't born an adult.", "eehhhhh.... My dad moved out when I was 10 and then moved states to be with my (now ex) stepmom when I was 13.  He \"made an effort\" by calling me occasionally, saw him maybe once a year, paid for my stuff that he was required to by the divorce.  Actually got a way better paying job but never pushed for the 50/50 custody of me he was supposed to have and also fought my mom on every little payment.  Like, when I needed new glasses and we asked for the money towards it and he \"wanted a say in what glasses I get\".  I mean, this was the early 00s, there was no virtual appointment way for him to be there and help me choose.  There was no amazon or warby parker for me to order from online.  Now that I'm an adult, he sometimes gets pouty that I don't call him more.  It's like \\*shoulder shrug\\* sorry? but, we didn't have those formative years of bonding, I don't really care that we're not that close. I would invite him to my wedding, though.  I don't necessarily think he's the AH based on what we know here, but I'm also curious as to what his idea of \"making an effort\" is versus what a teenage/young lady really needs from a father.  also, we don't know FOR SURE that she's using this as a test.", "That's totally fair for friends but different for children. OP had the best of intentions, but his resignation to not rock the boat means his daughter never saw him fight for her. To a kid, that's as good as not caring at all. He thinks that PTO and driving for hours is enough to show her he cared, but that's not the language kids speak. They don't understand how precious taking time off of work is and they don't understand mileage or gas prices or how much sacrificing hours in a care can hurt when you could be home getting housework or repairs done or even a nap on the weekends is.", "I'm sorry but what? That can't possibly be a real AITA post can it?", "I want an update to that one sooooooo much! Ideally from both the OP and anyone invited to that wedding, lol", ">He gave her a phone to keep in touch -> she changed her number and didn't give it to him.\n\nWhen did he buy her the phone? It's not like he bought her a phone 20 years ago and she somehow figured out how to change her number at 5 years old. I haven't looked at OPs comments, but if I had to make a guess, he bought the phone within the last decade, after the damage had already been done. \n\n>According to the post, he didn't abandon her. She was the one to act a way that made them grow apart. If she has an issue now, she can speak and explain herself\n\nYes and kids are not good at communicating their feelings. It gets even worse when they're teenagers and going through puberty. And by the time she's 25, the relationship is probably irreparable which is why the daughter didn't say anything. OP also doesn't mention that he even tried to figure out why she stopped wanting to spend time with him, which as a parent seems like the first thing he should have done. There is clearly a disconnect here between his daughters expectations and the amount of effort OP put into his relationship with his daughter and it sounds like he didn't make an effort to figure out where that disconnect was.", "That\u2019s exactly it. OP is screwed no matter what he does. \n\nHe made efforts to stay in her life but ended up respecting her wishes & pulled back? Dad is an asshole for abandoning his daughter. \n\nHe overrode her wishes & doubled down on trying to force a relationship with her? He\u2019s a crazy stalker lunatic asshole who won\u2019t respect her wishes. \n\nWhat exactly could he have done differently? I honestly don\u2019t know but as someone who pulls back myself when it\u2019s obvious another person doesn\u2019t want a relationship with me I tend to sympathize with OP.

Father and daughter had emotional issues well before his wedding. \n\nThe Ickiness of him marrying someone close to her age, having a sibling that will be close to her kids age, added fuel to the fire. \n\nParents can marry whenever and whoever they want, but there are consequences sometimes.", "People will just completely make shit up in order to blame a man and or parent here. OP was doomed from the start.", "He has the right to marry anyone over 18.

It isn't just sending money and gifts.  It's spending time. I also want to be with my kids.  I hope they want to be with me.

If he had a child later in life it\u2019s magically okay to fall in love with the same person?

Accepting a long distance relationship with your kid, to me, is indifference to the relationship.
