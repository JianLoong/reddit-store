This is criminal behavior and will continue until someone stops it.", "NTA and if that man ever does anything like that again call the fucking police and have him arrested.

If possible for you and your sister don\u2019t ever go there, tell your mom she has a choice to make either you don\u2019t see her again or she leaves this p edo.

Sadly, it happens. It also explains why she thinks you are an AH for not coming and such. Still, doesn't change that step-dad filmed you. The sad truth is this whole situation goes way beyond Christmas: as long your mom won't believe you, she will resent you for your claims against your sted-dad and not wanting to be involved with him anymore. So, be prepare for that, it might even comes to going LC/NC for a while. Seems like you have your dad support, this is great!", "NTA, the only people ever interested in keeping the peace are tyrants and their enablers.

Please turn him into the police.", "NTA - step dad is more than likely trading videos of you. I would call CPS. He has done this many times before.

I'm so sorry, love. This is so much more of a burden than you should have to bear, and as someone who is old enough to be your mum (or grandma) I am SO PROUD OF YOU for trying to protect your sisters!!\n\nListen, it is NOT YOUR JOB to do this by yourself. What your stepdad did is against the law, and it's okay that you deleted it (the police have ways of recovering deleted video), but it's really important than you tell a grownup that you trust - tell AS MANY GROWNUPS AS YOU NEED TO UNTIL SOMEONE LISTENS AND BELIEVES YOU. Do not be embarrassed, you haven't done anything wrong. Your mum did something REALLY wrong by trying to blame you and not believing you!! \n\nTell any grownup you can think of: a teacher, a school counselor, one of your friends' parents. And if they don't believe you, tell another grownup until someone does. If you can, call the police and tell them, exactly the way you told us: \"I am scared. My stepdad was videoing me in the shower. I got nervous and deleted it but my mum won't believe me and I am scared for me and my sisters. I need you to help me.\" Sweetheart, that's their job. You're being really brave, and I'm so sorry that you're going through this.\n\nYou keep saying no to ANYTHING that makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable. Don't worry if it makes your mum upset.
