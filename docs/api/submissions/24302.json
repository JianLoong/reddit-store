I would love to help you find a grief counselor or support group to help you find healthier coping mechanisms and process your grief\u2019: what a normal, loving spouse says.\n\n\u2018You need to get a hold of yourself and stop doing this shit\u2019: what someone who has no business being married says.", "YTA\n\nYou're legitimately worried about him, so you thought lashing out at him was the way to go? Asshole is actually too kind a word. If you care at all about him (which, honestly, it doesn't sound like you do), sit him down and explain that you are really worried about him. Talk about getting him into some sort of therapy. Also, get some counseling for yourself on how to deal with someone grieving because you suck at it.", "YTA\n\nHe was eating Taco Bell not smoking crack. His mom died five months ago, let him get fat for a minute. Do you realize how short five months is?", "YTA. \n\nWhat your husband needs is support and probably therapy, not to be told to suck it up and get a grip. Perhaps he\u2019s stress eating because his only support person has passed and he\u2019s left with you who clearly is showing no support or empathy for his loss.", "Grief is one of the most complicated battle we can have. He needs professional help. \n\nYTA for dealing the way you did. But I'm sure you care and love him. You should talk to him and try to get him to see a therapist.", "YTA, its OK to be worried that he is doing this, everyone grieves in different ways but if it's unhealthy for him then it should be addressed. It shouldn't be addressed like this, have some compassion and try to communicate with him about his feelings and actions, why you're concerned, not just to get over it and get a hold of himself.", "YTA - My mother\u2019s death was incredibly difficult for many reasons which were out of my control. Due to the stress, self-imposed guilt, and heartache I literally had a mental breakdown. I tried to keep it together for about 3 months while I silently spiraled and it wasn\u2019t until I almost ended my life that I admitted to my loved  ones how bad things were and got help. I had to take a leave of absence from my job, counseling and psychological therapy, etc. before I was finally able to heal enough to function in society again. \n\nThe fact that your husband is still struggling means he needs help, not you judging him and telling him to get his stuff together. His eating is a symptom not a new hobby. His reaction, to pull farther away from you and become more isolated at your words, is worrisome. People deal with things differently and in different time frames.", "YTA\n\nHe needs to find someone who loves him or at least likes him enough to talk to.", "YTA. His mother died less than 6 months ago and instead of getting him help, you snapped at him? Grief is not a joke. You clearly have no idea how to deal with a person who\u2019s grieving. Instead of berating him, you should\u2019ve motivated him to get help. \n\n> Then I asked him how long he planned to live like this\n\nWife of the year right there. You lack empathy.", "\"we haven't really talked since then\"\nThat was not a talk lady, that was you telling him what he should be doing and getting on his probably depressed ass about him gaining weight. Where is the concern about how he's feeling? Maybe focus on what he is going through rather than what you feel about it. How about you try an actual conversation instead of you telling him things that probably make him feel crappy about himself.", "YTA. He is still grieving.  Grief does not have an on and off switch.  Have you looked into local grief counseling?  Groups like that are generally free, run 8 weeks and they try to match you with similar losses. Churches offer a lot of these as well as palliative care centers. He needs help, not dismissal.", "Your lack of compassion is astounding. Did you even suggest therapy or anything else before blowing up on him? I wouldn't treat my enemies this way, never mind someone I've vowed to love and cherish- in \\*sickness and in health\\*.", "legit worried for 6 months? then start shit out of nowhere over taco bell?\n\nyup....you are sooooooo concerned.\n\nyta", "YTA. There's no deadline on grief. It's only been six months since he lost his mum and everything you said reeks of toxic masculinity expectations for men. You've pretty much told him to man up. To meet societies expectations of how men should handle grief. No tears and of course no emotional reaction at all. I mean how dare he be depressed over losing his mum \ud83d\ude44. You don't get to gatekeep his grieving process. It takes as long as it takes and his loss shouldn't be an inconvenience for you", "YTA\nMy mother was my best friend and I stayed with her at the end. I watched the light fade from her eyes as she drew her last breath and I have never known my father. I lost something the day she died.\nIf I hadn't had my own children to worry about, I don't even want to think about it.\nThat was cruel of you.\nApologise and tell him that you didn't mean it even if you did and talk about some grief counseling. Support him and help him through it. The loss of a parent doesn't just go away.", "YTA his mom died! He is literally grieving. Try supporting him and help him sort through his feelings, encourage therapy, etc. eating some junk food and gaining a couple pounds isn\u2019t that big of deal in the grand scheme of things. How much is \u201clooks like a lot\u201d? You\u2019re being very insensitive.", "YTA. there is no set time on how long someone is allowed to grieve. sure stress eating isn't the best way to deal with it, but there are way better ways to approach this. communication is so important. if you have concerns about your husband eating his feelings away, try just talking to him like a normal person should instead of berating him over his eating habits. you should find a moment to apologize to him, and then ask if sometime soon you could talk to him about his stress eating, and maybe find a better way to cope with the loss of his mother.", "YTA. Definitely not the way to go about helping someone through grief. Instead of being callous, maybe you could, IDK, have a heart and make some gentle observations to him that he's obviously hurting? Suggest counseling? So many different ways to go about this that don't involve shaming him for grieving the loss of a parent.", "YTA\n\nHe does need help but this isn\u2019t how you approach it.\n\nAugh, horrible", "YTA for the words you used, but are NTA for the feeling behind them. You recognize your husband has been struggling both mentally and physically since the death of his mother. Ask to sit down, apologize for the comment, and then open with the emotions behind it. You are worried and don't know how to help him. Would he please talk to you about his feelings and you work together to help him in his grief. Not \"get over it\", but learn to identify his emotions and ways to support himself during this difficult time. Couples counseling, grief support group, visiting his doctor to discuss any depression or anxiety he might be feeling. Offer to help him step by step.", "YTA\n\nYou don't just tell a grieving person to get a hold of themselves. Have you tried to get him to go to a support group instead or see a counselor?", "YTA. Why would you think he would want to speak to you? \n\nYou don't get to insert your opinion into someone else's grief.\n\nAnd even if he was doing something extreme, do you really think your approach conveys concern?", "Thing is, if he has a legit mental illness (like depression), you can't get yourself out via willpower alone.  You're not TA for stating that something needs to change but how you suggest he does it is wrong.", "YTA. This was not at all the way to approach this, doesn't seem like your emotions are coming from a place of care for him.", "YTA. My dad died when I was 12, I\u2019m now 28 and literally just discovering some ways that the lingering, unaddressed trauma from that might still be impacting me today, 16 years later. You expect him to be over the death in 5 months? \n\nThe grieving process does not move on your schedule. It is not linear. It often does not make sense. There will be times years from now where he\u2019s fine in his day to day life but he sees something or smells cooking that reminds him of her and suddenly he\u2019s right back there in his grief.\n\nBut you don\u2019t care about any of that. If you did, you would be showing concern for his well-being mentally instead of disgust at his weight. If you cared you would suggest he see a therapist, instead of being vile and hurtful. \n\nSome partner you are. In sickness and in health and for better or for worse meant fuck all to you I guess.", "I mostly hated my dad and his death fucked me up for almost two years and I nearly dropped out of school and lost my job hehe so yeah good luck", "YTA. You were very harsh. That isn't what he needed at all. You actually made the problem worse. He feels even worse about everything now, and it's going to be much harder for him to listen to you. \n\nYou need to give him some time and then approach him in a loving and patient way. Your approach should be to encourage him to get support for his grief and encourage him to get into hobbies and activities to express his grief. You could also plan some weekend walks and activities in nature -- but definitely don't frame it as he needs to do it to lose weight.", "YTA. He needs support. You can tell him that but it sounds like you\u2019ve mostly just ignored what he\u2019s going through until a sudden outburst about his weight.\n\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, eating time is never the time to discuss weight loss nor did you handle it even close to appropriately. It\u2019s like you wanted to hurt his feelings\u2026 guessing because you\u2019ve been bottling up yours.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have the right to dictate how someone processes and deals with grief. Grief doesn\u2019t have a limit. Either be supportive or not. He has to heal within his own time and deal with the loss in his own time and his own way. Stay in your lane until he\u2019s ready.", "YTA.\n\nYou shamed him instead of expressing concern over his mental state.", "YTA by being ignorant and judgmental about something that is actually beyond his control: GRIEF. \n\n\"How long does he plan on having Not-Manly-At-All-According-To-Me Emotions?\" Seriously?  \n\nWorse, trying to recover from grief while someone is judging you, looking at their watch, and tapping their foot impatiently is ALSO betraying the trust you are supposed to give your husband. \n\nMost people take vows like \"in sickness and in health\" during their marriage. Did you? Did you mean only if they hurt themselves physically when you took those vows, or did you think (like too many do) that emotions aren't really injuries? Did you think men don't need emotional support? Do you not know or learn how to provide it because you learned this false narrative?\n\nIt sounds like you have learned to mistake care for control and control for care. \n\nIf you're worried about someone and *they* are what is important, you react with compassion and not judgment. \n\nEveryone is saying YTA because if you're worried about someone and *you* are the important thing, then your reaction is to be controlling and lacking in empathy because it is now about YOU instead of them.   \n\nIt is my observation that this misplaced concern for yourself and your needs is a common pattern in this sub among people who are voted to be A's. \n\nGiving you the benefit of the doubt, perhaps you have a job that requires you to be professionally compassionate, resulting in compassion fatigue and an inability to be compassionate to and patient with your partner when they need it most. \n\nThere are many things it could be that mean you are responding in this manner, and I have listed some, but do take a look at it and try to do better.", "if \"Get a hold of yourself\" was the cure to depression then the world would be a much happier place for so many people.  \n\n\nHe sounds seriously depressed.  \n\n\nGet him some professional help and be glad his spiraling does not involve drugs or alcohol.", "YTA for being so harsh, there are better ways to show you're concerned about him", "YTA \n\nNot because you are worried about his stress eating and his spiral, but because of how you went about it. You exploded on a man who still recently lost his mother.\n\nWhat he needs is your love, care and support through his grief, not you attacking him.\n\nTalk to him gently. Ask how he is. How he feels.

I don't know if there's any off far enough for them to fuck...", "If that was the case she\u2019d have said that, instead of just \u201cit looks like he\u2019s gained a lot of weight\u201d There was not an ounce of care or concern in the language she chose to describe the situation. Just annoyance.", "Why does everyone make this claim about Taco Bell, but not McDonald's or Burger King?", "Because burgers don\u2019t normally turn your ass into a water fountain like low end mexican food.", "No? I just think people having the mentality that using food as a coping mechanism isn\u2019t dangerous are promoting harmful behavior. Emotional eating is a huge problem in American culture, and we\u2019re suffering for it. The answer is obviously therapy to help him develop coping skills and work through his grief.", "Uh, time and place my friend. Time and place. \n\n(Hint- this ain\u2019t either)", "I'm proud of you and happy for you\n\nIt took me a bit but he too was arrested for the final time and is now sleeping on his sisters couch and ain't coming back.\n\nGosh I didn't realize how much I needed to share about that to heal thank you", "Is eating the only thing? You mention depressed but only focus on his eating. I thought originally N until I reread and I think YTA. If he was destroying his life, others around him, yes be as harsh as you need. If he\u2019s a little sad and likes to eat a lot, relax girl.", "As somebody who literally JUST lost her mom unexpectedly, I hope I can speak to this reasonably. \n\nI understand that I am NOT the main character in what my family and her close friends are going through. It\u2019s perfectly normal to take a few weeks to allow yourself to grieve, binge eat, not eat, sleep, drink (or not) and mourn. After that, it\u2019s time to honor her legacy by living life and being a good person to those left behind as well as take care of yourself. \n\nI understand perfectly that everyone grieves differently but he needs to stop this. Would his mom want this?", "YTA!!!  \"Stop having a mental health crisis!!!!\" is not the correct response to someone you love experiencing grief.", "This is how deep seated fatphobia is. To look at a man mourning the loss of his mother and his wifes biggest concern is that he gained weight like its some moral failure on his part.", "Loved the turn this comment took", "He works 3 days a week(12 hour shifts) and then has 4 days off in row. Since she's died, He pretty much just stays in bed all his days off unless he's going to get food. His hygiene is bad. \n\nHe repeatedly watches their favorite movies and listens to music they'd listen to. Which is fine. But, he's in this endless cycle of them making him more and more upset/distressed when they end.. which makes him want to watch other things they'd watch together. It's not helping him at all.", "Yes, but not by being shamed for grieving.", "Exercise will also help your diet. Good luck!", "Don\u2019t they have a word for grieved eating also? Grief bacon or something iirc", "For real. My dog died and almost six months later I\u2019m STILL suffering. I can\u2019t imagine how deep the pain of losing your own mother is. Especially if he was close with her and they had a good relationship.", "Right? What's the most damage he could've done in 5 months? 30 pounds? People on here are acting like he's on his deathbed.", "With gambling, drugs, or something else major, sure. But not with taco bell.", "Exactly. At 6 months I was still caught up in my grief and depression.\nIt's now been almost 6 years and it somehow got easier with time. I wish I had taken the grief counseling but I had my kids to worry about and it took a while to actually hit.", "You need to suggest therapy. Not scolding him for how he\u2019s grieving. Yes, he needs to get himself out of this cycle but he needs HELP doing it. You\u2019re not helping by making him feel worse about himself.", "Your response could be quoted in every subreddit about why men don\u2019t open up or show emotion. Your response instead of showing compassion, was to give him the old \u201cpick yourself up by the boot straps!\u201d Talk that causes men to bury their feelings, because even at his most vulnerable, you\u2019re proving to him most people(especially women) don\u2019t care about men\u2019s feelings. YTA", "I still think your delivery was wrong, but I completely agree that something needs to change. Are you allowed/encouraged to join him watching those movies? Halloween is coming up, maybe pitch a couples costume based off something his mom loved?

Grow some empathy or something.", "BuT hIs HeArT\n\nshut up. you dont care about this mans heart condition. You just think being fat is  the biggest sin a person can commit.", "It's been almost three years since my mom died & I still don't have it all together. I live across the country from my family & I wasn't able to get home before she passed. I had to try & say goodbye over the phone. It took me close to a year (& a lot of \"Office\" episodes), before I didn't have to force myself to eat, shower, or go to work. Even now, some memory will hit & about knock me with grief, but I cope with it a little better....most of the time.", "I shopped like I'd never shopped before when my dad died. I recently found out my brother did the same.", "Yup yup yuppity yup. Reading this post my first thought was \u201coh, cool for you OP! Glad you\u2019ve never lost anyone! That must be nice\u2026\u201d \n\nI hope you were and continue to be surrounded by people who, even if they can\u2019t personally relate to the grief of losing someone really close to them, can at least grock the concept of grief like yours being life-shattering. Big virtual hugs on your continued journey of recovering a new normal after that trauma.", "I lost my father, my favorite aunt, and my brother in the span of a year. \n\nI was devastated and in complete shock. I couldn't feel anything. I didn't get out of bed for almost two weeks and had to adjust my work schedule, etc.\n\nA year later, my partner asked for a divorce because I wasn't catering to his needs the way I used to when I wasn't grieving.\n\nSome people have to make it about themselves.", "Admit to living off m&m\u2019s at work to get me through the day and then drinking beer after visiting parent daily who was dying of cancer.  Coping mechanisms aren\u2019t always healthy.   Stopped when parent passed.", "yeah, my dad die many years ago. It's something that never go away.\n\nThe gentleman could consult to help himself but the way his wife proceed was awful and unempathic. Big AH move", "Hence OP is very much TA. \n\nStill if it is a lot and quickly it is very much legitimate to bring up as a concerned spouse. Among any other symptom noticed.\n\nSince it is a symptom of depression. Or in this case of trauma. The spouse needs help.\n\nObviously not by saying anything on looks or even insulting. But it is perfectly fine to say that one noticed and asking if the spouse is fine or suggesting getting help if not.\n\nI myself was clinically obese as part of my depression but managed to get rid of it when my mental health was a lot better. However I still gain weight when my mental health declines and concerned loved ones may notice this outward sign much earlier.", "Never wish on people downfall\u2026 buttttttt I would like to see her when she goes through some serious loss and crumbles. \n\nThis post was entirely for validation of her insane opinion, and because it was totally insane, nobody agreed with her.

I bet your Dad is glad he helped you, too.", "I'm so sorry for your loss, that would be terrible to be so far away for it.", "I have had the worst happen to me and am living in the darkest, deepest pit of depression in my life right now. I couldn't care less about wishing downfall on someone else when the karmic reaction would have to kill me to really make a point.
