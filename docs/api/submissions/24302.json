I would love to help you find a grief counselor or support group to help you find healthier coping mechanisms and process your grief\u2019: what a normal, loving spouse says.\n\n\u2018You need to get a hold of yourself and stop doing this shit\u2019: what someone who has no business being married says.", "YTA\n\nYou're legitimately worried about him, so you thought lashing out at him was the way to go? Asshole is actually too kind a word. If you care at all about him (which, honestly, it doesn't sound like you do), sit him down and explain that you are really worried about him. Talk about getting him into some sort of therapy. Also, get some counseling for yourself on how to deal with someone grieving because you suck at it.", "YTA\n\nHe was eating Taco Bell not smoking crack. His mom died five months ago, let him get fat for a minute. Do you realize how short five months is?", "YTA. \n\nWhat your husband needs is support and probably therapy, not to be told to suck it up and get a grip. Perhaps he\u2019s stress eating because his only support person has passed and he\u2019s left with you who clearly is showing no support or empathy for his loss.", "Grief is one of the most complicated battle we can have. He needs professional help. \n\nYTA for dealing the way you did. But I'm sure you care and love him. You should talk to him and try to get him to see a therapist.", "YTA, its OK to be worried that he is doing this, everyone grieves in different ways but if it's unhealthy for him then it should be addressed. It shouldn't be addressed like this, have some compassion and try to communicate with him about his feelings and actions, why you're concerned, not just to get over it and get a hold of himself.", "YTA - My mother\u2019s death was incredibly difficult for many reasons which were out of my control. Due to the stress, self-imposed guilt, and heartache I literally had a mental breakdown. I tried to keep it together for about 3 months while I silently spiraled and it wasn\u2019t until I almost ended my life that I admitted to my loved  ones how bad things were and got help. I had to take a leave of absence from my job, counseling and psychological therapy, etc. before I was finally able to heal enough to function in society again. \n\nThe fact that your husband is still struggling means he needs help, not you judging him and telling him to get his stuff together. His eating is a symptom not a new hobby. His reaction, to pull farther away from you and become more isolated at your words, is worrisome. People deal with things differently and in different time frames.", "YTA\n\nHe needs to find someone who loves him or at least likes him enough to talk to.", "YTA. His mother died less than 6 months ago and instead of getting him help, you snapped at him? Grief is not a joke. You clearly have no idea how to deal with a person who\u2019s grieving. Instead of berating him, you should\u2019ve motivated him to get help. \n\n> Then I asked him how long he planned to live like this\n\nWife of the year right there. You lack empathy.", "\"we haven't really talked since then\"\nThat was not a talk lady, that was you telling him what he should be doing and getting on his probably depressed ass about him gaining weight. Where is the concern about how he's feeling? Maybe focus on what he is going through rather than what you feel about it. How about you try an actual conversation instead of you telling him things that probably make him feel crappy about himself.", "YTA. He is still grieving.  Grief does not have an on and off switch.  Have you looked into local grief counseling?  Groups like that are generally free, run 8 weeks and they try to match you with similar losses. Churches offer a lot of these as well as palliative care centers. He needs help, not dismissal.", "Your lack of compassion is astounding. Did you even suggest therapy or anything else before blowing up on him? I wouldn't treat my enemies this way, never mind someone I've vowed to love and cherish- in \\*sickness and in health\\*.", "legit worried for 6 months? then start shit out of nowhere over taco bell?\n\nyup....you are sooooooo concerned.\n\nyta", "YTA. There's no deadline on grief. It's only been six months since he lost his mum and everything you said reeks of toxic masculinity expectations for men. You've pretty much told him to man up. To meet societies expectations of how men should handle grief. No tears and of course no emotional reaction at all. I mean how dare he be depressed over losing his mum \ud83d\ude44. You don't get to gatekeep his grieving process. It takes as long as it takes and his loss shouldn't be an inconvenience for you", "YTA\nMy mother was my best friend and I stayed with her at the end. I watched the light fade from her eyes as she drew her last breath and I have never known my father. I lost something the day she died.\nIf I hadn't had my own children to worry about, I don't even want to think about it.\nThat was cruel of you.\nApologise and tell him that you didn't mean it even if you did and talk about some grief counseling. Support him and help him through it. The loss of a parent doesn't just go away.", "YTA his mom died! He is literally grieving. Try supporting him and help him sort through his feelings, encourage therapy, etc. eating some junk food and gaining a couple pounds isn\u2019t that big of deal in the grand scheme of things. How much is \u201clooks like a lot\u201d? You\u2019re being very insensitive.", "YTA. there is no set time on how long someone is allowed to grieve. sure stress eating isn't the best way to deal with it, but there are way better ways to approach this. communication is so important. if you have concerns about your husband eating his feelings away, try just talking to him like a normal person should instead of berating him over his eating habits. you should find a moment to apologize to him, and then ask if sometime soon you could talk to him about his stress eating, and maybe find a better way to cope with the loss of his mother.", "YTA. Definitely not the way to go about helping someone through grief. Instead of being callous, maybe you could, IDK, have a heart and make some gentle observations to him that he's obviously hurting? Suggest counseling? So many different ways to go about this that don't involve shaming him for grieving the loss of a parent.", "YTA\n\nHe does need help but this isn\u2019t how you approach it.\n\nAugh, horrible", "YTA for the words you used, but are NTA for the feeling behind them. You recognize your husband has been struggling both mentally and physically since the death of his mother. Ask to sit down, apologize for the comment, and then open with the emotions behind it. You are worried and don't know how to help him. Would he please talk to you about his feelings and you work together to help him in his grief. Not \"get over it\", but learn to identify his emotions and ways to support himself during this difficult time. Couples counseling, grief support group, visiting his doctor to discuss any depression or anxiety he might be feeling. Offer to help him step by step.", "YTA\n\nYou don't just tell a grieving person to get a hold of themselves. Have you tried to get him to go to a support group instead or see a counselor?", "YTA. Why would you think he would want to speak to you? \n\nYou don't get to insert your opinion into someone else's grief.\n\nAnd even if he was doing something extreme, do you really think your approach conveys concern?", "Thing is, if he has a legit mental illness (like depression), you can't get yourself out via willpower alone.  You're not TA for stating that something needs to change but how you suggest he does it is wrong.", "YTA. This was not at all the way to approach this, doesn't seem like your emotions are coming from a place of care for him.", "YTA. My dad died when I was 12, I\u2019m now 28 and literally just discovering some ways that the lingering, unaddressed trauma from that might still be impacting me today, 14 years later. You expect him to be over the death in 5 months? \n\nThe grieving process does not move on your schedule. It is not linear. It often does not make sense. There will be times years from now where he\u2019s fine in his day to day life but he sees something or smells cooking that reminds him of her and suddenly he\u2019s right back there in his grief.\n\nBut you don\u2019t care about any of that. If you did, you would be showing concern for his well-being mentally instead of disgust at his weight. If you cared you would suggest he see a therapist, instead of being vile and hurtful. \n\nSome partner you are. In sickness and in health and for better or for worse meant fuck all to you I guess.", "I mostly hated my dad and his death fucked me up for almost two years and I nearly dropped out of school and lost my job hehe so yeah good luck", "YTA. You were very harsh. That isn't what he needed at all. You actually made the problem worse. He feels even worse about everything now, and it's going to be much harder for him to listen to you. \n\nYou need to give him some time and then approach him in a loving and patient way. Your approach should be to encourage him to get support for his grief and encourage him to get into hobbies and activities to express his grief. You could also plan some weekend walks and activities in nature -- but definitely don't frame it as he needs to do it to lose weight.", "YTA. He needs support. You can tell him that but it sounds like you\u2019ve mostly just ignored what he\u2019s going through until a sudden outburst about his weight.\n\nEven if that\u2019s not the case, eating time is never the time to discuss weight loss nor did you handle it even close to appropriately. It\u2019s like you wanted to hurt his feelings\u2026 guessing because you\u2019ve been bottling up yours.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have the right to dictate how someone processes and deals with grief. Grief doesn\u2019t have a limit. Either be supportive or not. He has to heal within his own time and deal with the loss in his own time and his own way. Stay in your lane until he\u2019s ready.", "YTA.\n\nYou shamed him instead of expressing concern over his mental state.", "YTA by being ignorant and judgmental about something that is actually beyond his control: GRIEF. \n\n\"How long does he plan on having Not-Manly-At-All-According-To-Me Emotions?\" Seriously?  \n\nWorse, trying to recover from grief while someone is judging you, looking at their watch, and tapping their foot impatiently is ALSO betraying the trust you are supposed to give your husband. \n\nMost people take vows like \"in sickness and in health\" during their marriage. Did you? Did you mean only if they hurt themselves physically when you took those vows, or did you think (like too many do) that emotions aren't really injuries? Did you think men don't need emotional support? Do you not know or learn how to provide it because you learned this false narrative?\n\nIt sounds like you have learned to mistake care for control and control for care. \n\nIf you're worried about someone and *they* are what is important, you react with compassion and not judgment. \n\nEveryone is saying YTA because if you're worried about someone and *you* are the important thing, then your reaction is to be controlling and lacking in empathy because it is now about YOU instead of them.   \n\nIt is my observation that this misplaced concern for yourself and your needs is a common pattern in this sub among people who are voted to be A's. \n\nGiving you the benefit of the doubt, perhaps you have a job that requires you to be professionally compassionate, resulting in compassion fatigue and an inability to be compassionate to and patient with your partner when they need it most. \n\nThere are many things it could be that mean you are responding in this manner, and I have listed some, but do take a look at it and try to do better.", "if \"Get a hold of yourself\" was the cure to depression then the world would be a much happier place for so many people.  \n\n\nHe sounds seriously depressed.  \n\n\nGet him some professional help and be glad his spiraling does not involve drugs or alcohol.", "YTA for being so harsh, there are better ways to show you're concerned about him", "YTA \n\nNot because you are worried about his stress eating and his spiral, but because of how you went about it. You exploded on a man who still recently lost his mother.\n\nWhat he needs is your love, care and support through his grief, not you attacking him.\n\nTalk to him gently. Ask how he is. How he feels.

I would approach him like this \"I am so sorry for how I reacted yesterday. It was totally uncalled for and I apologize. Unfortunately I responded in anger instead of concern. I'm really worried about how you're processing your mom's death. I want to be there to help you with this and also help you find other support like a grief counselor or a support group. I want you to know you're not alone in this.\" But approaching him with anger is only going to drive him away more.", "YTA how long would be reasonable to grieve for the woman that gave birth to you and raised you? I know that you his behaviour has been a little self destructive and you\u2019ve probably been going through this for a while with him but it\u2019s what you said to him and not necessarily what you meant. I\u2019m sure you have concerns about his health and mental well being and he does need help to deal with his grief but your words and the way you put it seem cruel and disrespectful. I think you need to look up ways to support him and help him through his grief and then talk to him and apologise about your words but that you are worried about him. Suggest some therapy or a local support group for grief and talk about ways you can better help him going forward.", "Soft YTA\n\nMy mum died in 2020 and I\u2019m still living day to day wondering if I\u2019ll cry, it really hit me 6 months after she died. I just kept crying and crying. I couldn\u2019t stop it. Every single day. My mum died of cancer and I had to watch her die. Is this the case for your husband? Those memories are really hard to shake. \n\nI went to counselling and I think it helped me a lot, tbh it just gave me someone to speak to and meant I didn\u2019t feel like a burden to other people in my life. Please look into this for your husband. It will give him an outlet. \n\nPushing him to \u201cget a hold of himself\u201d will only make him feel worse like he is letting you down.

You may not understand how difficult it is to lose someone very dear to you and how someone may not know a healthy way to heal from it. Telling them to control themselves and expecting them to heal from the loss in 6 short months is super unrealistic and vey cold of you. I highly encourage you to first realize that you can beore supportive and loving towards your spouse. You can validate how difficult this is for him, ask him how you can help and stop putting a limit on how long he can grieve. You can additionally pay attention to the hobbies he likes, the things he likes and plan those as an outing for you both. You can propose to go on walks together, or try new places to eat. These are mich gentler and supportive ways of showing through actions that you empathize with your husband's loss and care enough to try to make him feel better. \n\nYes, YTA", "YTA.

Grief isn\u2019t something that goes away; you just learn to live with it (don\u2019t give me that times a great healer bollocks either). Each day is completely different. For me most of the time I\u2019m absolutely fine & happy but it can only take a random smell, thought, piece of music, memory and suddenly it comes back crashing over you. That\u2019s what grief is like! The difference is now I know it will pass & I\u2019m grateful for those memories. \n\nJesus try some empathy for once! The guy is crying out for help & all you\u2019ve done is kick him even further down. Good luck getting him to open up to you now! All you\u2019ve shown him is you don\u2019t give a crap about how he feels so he\u2019s not going to listen to any advice you try to give him now.

I know you are frustrated but that was a really awful thing to say. \n\nYou need to start by apologising.

You attacked him, and insulted him. And obviously just made him feel even shittier than he was already feeling. And you know what that does? It prompts a person to spiral even more, to eat even more, to pull away from you even more.\n\nHave you even talked to him about his mom and his loss and his struggles, or have you just been passively observing and waiting for him to \u201cget over it\u201d and \u201cmove on?\u201d Then attacked him when you felt like he was taking too long for your liking, or handling it in a way you don\u2019t agree with? Have you offered to, say, go for a walk with him? To either talk, or just walk in silence? Yeah, overeating isn\u2019t a healthy coping mechanism, but it\u2019s better than some other options. Not as good as some options, but who are you to dictate? \n\nBottom line - your \u201cconcern\u201d should have been addressed gently, with compassion and support. And you know what? You could absolutely be there for him without ever even mentioning his weight or overeating. He knows, he doesn\u2019t need you to throw it in his face.
