I babysit Ally at least once a week if not more. Over the summer I was basically Mackenzie's daycare plan where I agreed to take care of Ally while she worked for $200/week.\n\nI'd also babysit her on the weekends a lot so Mackenzie could go party with her friends. After a few weeks of her coming home hours later with not text or warning I told her that I'd begin charging her double for every hour she's late. So if I was supposed to babysit from 7-11 that'd be $40. But if I was supposed to babysit 7-11 and she came home at 3 am then she'd need to pay me $120.\n\nShe wouldn't pay more then the $40 unless her mom made her pay or or her mom would pay it for her. She kept coming home late and began to stop paying me, I kept track and sent her a text telling her that unless she paid me what she owed I wouldn't babysit Ally at all. She did after two weeks of me not answering any requests to babysit but I decided to \"fire\" her anyway and tell her I won't be babysitting for her again because of her refusal to pay me. Also without babysitting Ally so much I can babysit for other people who pay more.\n\nMy mom and her mom are really upset since she can't afford other childcare and they keep telling me just to babysit for her and they'll make sure that she pays me or pay me for her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694105455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ckuab/aita_for_firing_one_of_my_babysitting_clients/", "score": 3082, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its not for you to make up her lack of income.\n\nYou were doing Mackenzie, Mackenzie's mom, and your own mom a favor AND all of them are abusing your kindness and understanding.\n\nUnfortunately for Mackenzie there are consequences to her actions.
