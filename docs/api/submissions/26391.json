In that time I've gotten some regular families who'll have my babysit. One of my first clients was Mackenzie, she's 21 and has a 5 year old daughter Ally. Her mom and my mom are close friends, she was one of my first clients and because I was doing it as a favor to my mom I gave her a reduced rate, $10/hour, my other clients pay $15-25/hour depending on how many kids they have and the kids age.\n\nRecently I decided to \"fire\" Mackenzie and stop babysitting Ally. I babysit Ally at least once a week if not more. Over the summer I was basically Mackenzie's daycare plan where I agreed to take care of Ally while she worked for $200/week.\n\nI'd also babysit her on the weekends a lot so Mackenzie could go party with her friends. After a few weeks of her coming home hours later with not text or warning I told her that I'd begin charging her double for every hour she's late. So if I was supposed to babysit from 7-11 that'd be $40. But if I was supposed to babysit 7-11 and she came home at 3 am then she'd need to pay me $120.\n\nShe wouldn't pay more then the $40 unless her mom made her pay or or her mom would pay it for her. She kept coming home late and began to stop paying me, I kept track and sent her a text telling her that unless she paid me what she owed I wouldn't babysit Ally at all. She did after two weeks of me not answering any requests to babysit but I decided to \"fire\" her anyway and tell her I won't be babysitting for her again because of her refusal to pay me. Also without babysitting Ally so much I can babysit for other people who pay more.\n\nMy mom and her mom are really upset since she can't afford other childcare and they keep telling me just to babysit for her and they'll make sure that she pays me or pay me for her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694105455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ckuab/aita_for_firing_one_of_my_babysitting_clients/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They do her a disservice because she is 21 and needs to learn consequence and responsibility.

Your mom is welcome to babysit, her mom is welcome to babysit, but you gave her a chance and it she failed.", "NTA, an ordinary situation. If she can't pay...", "NTA.
