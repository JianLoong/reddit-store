I don't see why your parents even bothered with giving you a name they weren't going to call you. And then to get upset that you didn't identify with it... Regardless, it's your name. Call yourself whatever you like", "NTA you can keep both. You are still young and you will travel abroad where your Asian name will be useful to the new friends and connections you make. It\u2019s 2023, you can tell people straight to call you what you like. \nI gave my daughter two names so she could use either. You can do the same:)", "NTA, she should have just called you Jessica if that's what she wanted everyone to call you.", "Nta-that said, if you want to go by your real name, I suggest you tell folks what it is, and ask to be addressed as such. When I grew up, my family called me a nickname, and it stuck for elementary school, but by high school, I was being called my actual name by most folks outside my family, caused I told them my real name, and even a few reminders when needed-good luck", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR name at the end of the day, you deserve to be addressed as whatever name you please.", "Nta especially if you have no connection to the name and they only have themselves to blame. It was nice you asked but once you are 18 or older you can go change it yourself if you still feel strongly about it.", "NTA It\u2019s your name and your identity. A lot of people with English names and non-English backgrounds are reclaiming their names and it\u2019s awesome.\n\nI\u2019m glad your mum is on your side.

I don't get what their problem with Chinese names is, or why they can't get over it, but this is really common in the UK.\n\nOther immigrant groups in the UK retain their birth names, even when they're harder for Anglophones to say.  It's just a Chinese thing.\n\nYou get to choose the name you want.", "NTA - It always confused me, that East Asian rooted families seen to hide their real names behind western names. It feels like they want to hide their real identities behind a veil of lies. Or maybe have a problem with wrongful pronunciation, as our western ears are not trained for the slight nuances in especially Chinese names? Whatever it is, you are free to change your name to the one you feel comfortable with.", "So, let me get this right, they gave you a legal name, birth certificate and everything....... then chose to call you Jessica?  Why? Is your birth name to hard to pronounce? Excuse my ignorance but I'm so confused? I understand shortening a name but to change it completely, to something I'm assuming does even resemble the birth name. \n\nHey, I don't blame you for being upset. Definitely NTA! Id be pissed too if I found out my name wasn't really my name! Do whatever makes you happy, change it, don't change it, hyphenate it. At the end of the day, you're the one living with the name, if your parents loved your birth name so much, that they're upset about you legally changing it...... I guess they shouldn't have renamed you", "What\u2019s your real name?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It reeks of internalised racism, to be honest.", "I grew up always being called by my middle name. I always knew my first name, I was just never called by it.

Her adoptive parents gave her a typical western name but kept her asian name as a middle name.\n\nSo her name is something normal western, asian(middle name) and a local surname to that spesific region of the country. \nBut why not just have named you Jessica when they named you instead of using traditional names and go for a fake name all your life?\n\nI don't understand the logic here(in this spesific case.) .

They choose (or are given) names that fit the culture because people will actually pronounce them correctly and there's a slightly lower risk of them experiencing racism and discrimination if they don't stand out as being \"foreign\". It's a way that they, or their parents, try to protect themselves. Also a person's identity is not contingent on what name they're addressed by.", "Some names sounds horrible to Western ears. But still a beautiful name in the original language.

Those are nice names but omg to English speakers....\n\nBesides I know lots of people who when learning a new language, chose a different name for that language. \"Oh my German name is xxx.\" \"My Japanese name is \"\n\nSo having both a English name and Chinese name seems normal since that's a common practice?", "They probably and understandably didn't want her to get bullied by her peer for her foreign name", "Kind of want to stay anonymous so I didn\u2019t say it", "So I know people like to bash assumptions, but it sounds like the parents had some experiences with xenophobia. \n\nAustralia doesn\u2019t exactly have a great reputation for welcoming immigrants.
