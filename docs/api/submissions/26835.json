Your parents gave it to you without your say, just like your legal name\u2014parenting is one of their duties, after all. The names you accumulate as you live your life are all different parts of your identity\u2014your ethnic heritage, your childhood, and your various life experiences. They\u2019re all pieces that make you you. \n\nPersonally, I have ethnic names in two different languages, only one of which is my legal name, while the other was never used. I have an English-sounding nickname, and many have opted to call me by nicknames derived from my legal name. My high school French teacher gave me a French name, and I got to use my obscure second ethnic name (had to ask my parents what it was \u2026 and they\u2019d kinda forgotten too!) when I started taking classes in that language. They\u2019re all me, and none of them are fake. \n\nNevertheless, you are free to pick whichever one of your names you want to be your legal name, because things can get tricky if no one recognizes your current one.

It's common in Chinese culture to do this. I weirdly have an official name in english but a chinese name that's unofficial and never used that I wish they had put as a middle name or something at least - telling me about it at all was entirely pointless. All my ethnically Chinese relatives have both an official Chinese name and an unofficial English name though with the older generation their unofficial names became their official names (paperwork was very lax in those days) and it's all very confusing. The older generation in the UK (I imagine it's similar in Australia) gave themselves english names to \"fit in\", to try and avoid prejudice and avoid people teasing them about their names/getting it wrong to make integration easier. So I think your parents meant well, tried to make your life easier with an english name so you wouldn't be teased at school, but at the same time wanted you to keep a bit of your heritage with a traditional name.\nI wanted to change my name when I was a kid and my mum found it hilarious (the name was a shocker) but I think she would probably take it a bit personally if I did that now.

This is just something everyone does automatically there and I don't think they are the only ones who does this. People who live in China and will never leave probably still have an American name picked out if they went to English classes. Heck, I don't live in an English speaking country, but lots of Asian people here use American names even though it makes them stick out. It's because it's the name they got picked out at home. I think Jessica's parents have western names too. It's just something everyone does there. It's very common, it's expected. They probably didn't even need to think about it", "A lot of people here suggested you keep your given name as a middle name.

So maybe other western countries \ndon't have that problem in which I apologize for generalizing. Sorry.\n\n American Children are not as understanding as adult because they haven't been exposed to different cultures.

(My brother literally gotten physically harassed over it. Some kids took scissors and cut part of his clothes while he wasn't looking.) \n\nAnyhow. Even brand names would change their names if it means something bad in a different language so I just think it's just common practice to do that if they feel the need to. \n\nI guess my point is having a \"english\" names has its own reasoning and  it's not \"hiding\" but that both names are VALID.", "This post actually makes me laugh quite a bit. My name is actually Jessica and I always hated it as a kid.

Names long predate birth certificates, or even writing. Being on the birth certificate does not make the name more \"real\" than the other one which is used.\n\nAnd with *that* said, this is something I've seen many people from East Asian countries do with their kids.
