Whatever it is, you are free to change your name to the one you feel comfortable with.", "So, let me get this right, they gave you a legal name, birth certificate and everything....... then chose to call you Jessica?  Why? Is your birth name to hard to pronounce? Excuse my ignorance but I'm so confused? I understand shortening a name but to change it completely, to something I'm assuming does even resemble the birth name. \n\nHey, I don't blame you for being upset. Definitely NTA! Id be pissed too if I found out my name wasn't really my name! Do whatever makes you happy, change it, don't change it, hyphenate it.

Only calling your kid a Western name from birth but not having it as their legal name, not so much.", "Weird kind of reasoning, in my opinion. Some English names have a really strange meaning in other languages, and the other way around. Because languages are different. I don't laugh at names like Mason or Dom or words like pick or cut, because they are obviously English names and words, not Dutch ones.", "Ohhhhh okie just tell people what YOU wanna go by", "She already does", "NAH\n\nI would not say that your English name is a fake name though. Your parents gave it to you without your say, just like your legal name\u2014parenting is one of their duties, after all. The names you accumulate as you live your life are all different parts of your identity\u2014your ethnic heritage, your childhood, and your various life experiences. They\u2019re all pieces that make you you. \n\nPersonally, I have ethnic names in two different languages, only one of which is my legal name, while the other was never used. I have an English-sounding nickname, and many have opted to call me by nicknames derived from my legal name. My high school French teacher gave me a French name, and I got to use my obscure second ethnic name (had to ask my parents what it was \u2026 and they\u2019d kinda forgotten too!) when I started taking classes in that language. They\u2019re all me, and none of them are fake. \n\nNevertheless, you are free to pick whichever one of your names you want to be your legal name, because things can get tricky if no one recognizes your current one. But once you grow older, I think you\u2019ll come to treasure having the richness in personal identity that comes with having alternate names in your back pocket!", "NAH. It's common in Chinese culture to do this. I weirdly have an official name in english but a chinese name that's unofficial and never used that I wish they had put as a middle name or something at least - telling me about it at all was entirely pointless. All my ethnically Chinese relatives have both an official Chinese name and an unofficial English name though with the older generation their unofficial names became their official names (paperwork was very lax in those days) and it's all very confusing. The older generation in the UK (I imagine it's similar in Australia) gave themselves english names to \"fit in\", to try and avoid prejudice and avoid people teasing them about their names/getting it wrong to make integration easier. So I think your parents meant well, tried to make your life easier with an english name so you wouldn't be teased at school, but at the same time wanted you to keep a bit of your heritage with a traditional name.\nI wanted to change my name when I was a kid and my mum found it hilarious (the name was a shocker) but I think she would probably take it a bit personally if I did that now. I was going to say give her a little time and she'll come round, as it's a big deal to a parent, but looks like your mum has already accepted and is supporting you. Wonderful to hear. And all the best with your new name.", "NAH\n\nAs a Chinese I don\u2019t see the problem from both your side and your parent.\n\nPersonally for me I don\u2019t really care either way on how my Chinese name is use, legally that is my name in country, but I can have \u201cNickname\u201d which can be my name to be call by people, it\u2019s not even the same \u201cnickname\u201d my parent use on me.\n\nYou do you I guess, get the name you feel comfortable in.\n\nEdit: also Chinese have a culture where they \u201cpray\u201d for a good Chinese name at temple.", "None of us choose our birth names. Your parents grew up in a totally different way to you and have done nothing wrong. I'm glad with your update that this seems to be resolved.", "Not that you would need to, but maybe it would be nice to just keep the japanese name as a second name? :o \n\nYou\u2018d still have it but your actual name you get called by and have to write down would be the one you identify with :) just a thought \ud83e\uddd0", "NAH - glad it worked out for you.", "NTA. If she never called you by it, why does she even think of it as your name? Though I think it'd be nice to keep it as a middle name, that way you're not getting rid of anything just updating things to reflect the reality that most people know you as Jessica.", "NTA. \n\nThis is normal in my country though. You don't see it that much anymore, however some parents give their child 2 or 3 baptismal names and then say we will call the baby \"a totally different name\". While the baptismal names are also the legal names. \n\nLuckily most parents these days use the first baptismal name also as the name they will call the child.", "Yeah for a happy outcome!", "I would just move it as your middle name but have Jessica be your first name.

I've always been called my middle name, and it had always been a pain in the ass.", "It's common in the UK too, especially previous generations. They want to give the child their heritage in the name, but avoid the child being teased at school/struggling at work for having a foreign name. This happened in my family and with my friends from the same background a lot, because our parents suffered those little racist digs and prejudices when they first moved here and wanted to spare their children.", "The reason for Chinese doing this (from what I understand) is the tonal issue... Westerners are not used to Chinese tonal intricacies so even if they meen well they can horribly mispronounce names, unlike other groups when it is at least understandable easily", "I think there is a cultural context a lot of commenters are missing here. I am a similar background to OP and there is a VERY good reason her parents and many other ethnically chinese parents did/do this, especially years ago. To avoid the same prejudices and little racist digs that befell them and make it easier for the children to fit in whilst retaining their heritage through and official name.", "Hello, person from a Chinese family here- to clear up your confusion- it\u2019s mostly because many people are bullied or face discrimination because of their names.", "I manage a lot of students whose families are originally from Asian countries (or still live in those countries while the child attends college in the US) and it is incredibly common for them to have both a legal name that they use with family and in their native country, as well as a name that they go by in while living in western countries.", "Chinese people get to pick American names in English class. This is just something everyone does automatically there and I don't think they are the only ones who does this. People who live in China and will never leave probably still have an American name picked out if they went to English classes. Heck, I don't live in an English speaking country, but lots of Asian people here use American names even though it makes them stick out. It's because it's the name they got picked out at home. I think Jessica's parents have western names too. It's just something everyone does there. It's very common, it's expected. They probably didn't even need to think about it", "A lot of people here suggested you keep your given name as a middle name.   Sounds like it would make your mom happy, and Jessica becomes your real name.", "Not if you live there though and sorry, I'm speaking  as an immigrant family in America. So maybe other western countries \ndon't have that problem in which I apologize for generalizing. Sorry.\n\n American Children are not as understanding as adult because they haven't been exposed to different cultures. A middle schooler who hears Sukhdeep, would make blowjob harassment to the poor girl. \n\nMy brother who didn't even have a bad name got made fun of because he had a \"girl\" name up to the point that we had to nicknamed him a different name. (My brother literally gotten physically harassed over it. Some kids took scissors and cut part of his clothes while he wasn't looking.) \n\nAnyhow. Even brand names would change their names if it means something bad in a different language so I just think it's just common practice to do that if they feel the need to. \n\nI guess my point is having a \"english\" names has its own reasoning and  it's not \"hiding\" but that both names are VALID."]}
