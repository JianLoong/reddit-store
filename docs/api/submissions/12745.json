I announced my engagement last year in January and asked my best friends to be bridesmaids. One friend (Lucy 32f) was already pregnant (would have a 6 month old at the wedding) and a month or two after another (Sarah 33f) announced she was pregnant (would have a 3 month old at the wedding) non of which bothered me in the slightest. I requested the babies didn't come to the ceremony but are more than welcome for the rest of the day.\n\nBoth babies have been born now and both Lucy and Sarah have been exclusively breastfeeding. Lucy has eventually managed to get her little one to feed from a bottle (this is off her own back with no pressure from me, I understand the children are young and it can be difficult to leave them for a full day) just in time for the hen party which is Saturday. Sarah is having trouble with this and has announced that her SO will be around the bars we will be in with her baby so he can bring the baby to her to feed. I'm not sure this is appropriate and told her one bar specifically doesn't allow children, to which she replied 'Oh, SO will have to go next door then'. Turns out she had planned for her SO and baby to be in the bars with us just at a different table. I told her if it's that much stress for her maybe just come to lunch and then go home to her child. She said that no, she doesn't mind breastfeeding her at the bar and it will be fine.\n\nThe other bridesmaids and I were quite confused and said surely you're not suggesting bringing your 2 month old child on a hen party? I told her straight there would be drinking, swearing and god knows what else going on and it's just not appropriate, which she took offence at and is now hardly talking to any of us. My question is, was I too harsh? Is it okay for her SO to follow us around bars and restaurants with their baby? AITA?\n\nEDIT \n\n1) To be clear - she won't be drinking at the bachelorette, so no problem with breastfeeding.\n\n2) No smoking in bars in our state. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1679314535, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11whajo/aita_for_telling_my_bridesmaid_she_cant_bring_her/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's your party and infants generally don't belong in bars lol", "NAH - I mean, that doesn't sound like much fun for her? But I suppose if she wants to step away for a bit every few hours to feed her baby that's not the worst thing in the world. Not saying breastfeeding/being a parent is a medical issue, but in this context I would say it is similar to someone who has to step away to check to their insulin every couple of hours - a pain for her but not a burden on anyone else. Its not as if she is planning on bringing the baby around with her in stroller. \n\nI can see why this might feel weird to you - knowing she may be distracted by this, having her SO as a semi-participant in the hen party. But it honestly sounds like she tried to come up with the least intrusive way possible to still participate in the hen party while also caring for her child. \n\nI can pretty much assure you that if this ends up being a problem for anyone, it is going to be her and her SO, not you or the rest of the party. I doubt they will last more than a few places before this becomes too much for them or the baby.   \n\nTBH - I am guessing that she is struggling right now. It is incredibly hard for people who are exclusively breastfeeding because it severely limits the amount of time they can have for themselves. As much as she loves her baby, she is probably dying for some adult time. \n\nI don't think you need to change any of your plans for your hen party or alter your behavior in any way during the hen party to accommodate her plan, but I do think it would be gracious of you to tell her that if she wants to try and make this work that it is ok with you.", "NTA but I think there's a compromise to be made here. It sounds like she's really going out of her way to try and be there for you. I get why you don't want him in the actual venues you'll be in but if he can hold up nearby and she's willing to pop out every 3 hours then that kinda sounds like a win/win.", "NAH. But maybe be more understanding of why you're friend may be so desperate to stop go. Being pregnant and postpartum can be a very lonely time and she probably is desperate to feel normal in some way", "LOL NTA. does she think these bars are going to be okay with some dude walking in with a brand new human and sitting there?", "NAH. You\u2019re right that bars are not the most friendly places for babies, but a two month old is not going to be bothered by swearing or anything else happening tbh. Sarah is going out of her way to ensure that she can be there to support you while also making sure that her baby is fed. \n\nBaby and SO don\u2019t need to stick around all night though - once baby has been fed there\u2019s no need. Maybe bring that option up?", "NTA. My friend brought her 6 month old to my Bachelorette party, and I wasn't even given a heads up. I just showed up and her kid was there. I was less than pleased.\n\nOn the other side, my sister had her husband bring the baby to the restaurant and she breastfed her out in the car(her choice, I was more then happy to have her stay at the table) and then came back in. She didn't care, I didn't care, everyone was happy. \n\nThere is a compromise to be made, you and your sister just need to come to an agreement! \n\nBut never the asshole for not wanting kids at your special event. As the only kidless person in my friendgroup and family (and not by choice) I know this feeling all too well.", "NTA, the bridesmaid needs to take some responsibility as a parent and take your advice. There's nothing wrong with missing the party.", "Nta. I question your friend's parenting skills. Was she planning on drinking too?", "Nta she is who thinks it okay to bring a 2 mo th old to a hen party", "NTA. Who would think a baby at a hen party is a hood idea?", "NTA. Sounds like she's struggling to prioritise.", "NTA people need to get over themselves.  \n\nI have a bunch of kids and my wife has breastfed.  \n\nEach mother has to ask themselves why they are breastfeeding and how they're going to manage it.  If they want to be the exclusive feeder, god bless them - fine.  It requires sacrifice.  Too many of these people want to make a show of it and let everyone know what an awesome mom they are.  Great.  Congratulations.\n\nMy wife pumped during off cycles/etc.  This allowed us to freeze spare milk and me to get up with the baby at night.  If your friend doesn't want to do this, lugging a baby around to bars/etc. is absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA  that's just frigging weird as all get out. She's going to have her boyfriend sit in a bar with a 2 month old so she can breastfeed in between drinks? There are times in life you have to give up stuff for your kids and this is one of them.", "Are you seriously concerned about a 3 months seeing people drinking and hearing swears over the same baby not being able to eat when it needs to ?  \n\n\nWell I think you have to review some notion about how the human brain works at that age.  \n\n\nYTA.", "NTA", "YTA. She is doing this for you while managing an infant. It's actually none of your business how she accomplishes feeding her baby.", "nta - there was a commenter that came up with why doesnt she pump a few bottles so the bf doesnt have to go and sit in the bar with baby (i would be suprised the bar even allowed the baby in ) that way she gets to go to the hen party and baby has breastmilk at home.   i hope you all can come to a solution that makes everyone happy.", "NTA she's a lunatic for wanting to 1) take her infant barhopping and 2) breastfeed her child after consuming alcohol. Her SO can manage the baby for a few hours, or don't bother showing up - Being a parent (to an infant especially) requires a lot of sacrifice. This may just be one of those sacrifices she will have to make", "NTA-She\u2019s got a newborn and wanting to tote the newborn into a bar (not the most hygienic place for a baby with a that\u2019s just developing their immune system.) I understand she may want to come along but tell her it\u2019s okay to sit this one out. I know she wants to come but I can\u2019t see myself putting my newborn babies immune system at risk. I also thought you couldn\u2019t drink while breastfeeding or had to wait so many hours.", "Uh, NTA. She's cracked though to think that bringing any child, especially a baby, to a bar. You've offered reasonable solutions, and maybe it's post-partum pregnancy hormones making her act this way, but she being incredibly unreasonable.", "There is a time and place and baby\u2019s don\u2019t belong at a hens or at a bar \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. I don't have kids, but even I think it is a bad idea to tote a 2 month old baby around to various bars. Even if Sarah's SO is doing the actual toting. Let's point out the various drawbacks. Bars are loud & there is always the potential for mishaps ie; Fights, spills, drunk people tripping into the SO/baby. And then Sarah has to take time to feed the baby. So, her attention isn't going to be completely with the hen party anyway. Can Sarah pump enough milk to leave SO & her baby home? That would be only way I could see this working. \n\nSo no, you weren't being too harsh.", "OMG... a grown woman thinks her SO dragging a baby around an entire day or night from bar to bar is acceptable parenting?  Also, why???  If she is drinking, the baby can't have any of that milk anyway, so she will need to pump and dump - making the effort to follow and hold breastfeeding sessions completely useless.  This is not an appropriate  solution for the party, your friend, but most of all the baby.\n\nNTA and your friend thinking this is accpeatble is either a shitty parent or a selfish stupid friend.  With parenting comes compromise...", "YTA. There's nothing inherently wrong with bringing a baby to a party venue and there's no harm at all in breastfeeding a baby after a few drinks. The harm would be handling a baby if you're too drunk, but dad would be there anyway so that would be a non issue for her. Separating a mother and baby can cause enormous amounts of separation anxiety in both parent and baby, and she was trying her best to be able to be at your hen party anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Although there was a compromise here that didn\u2019t involve you asserting judgement of her choice or parenting. It\u2019s an infant, the infant doesn\u2019t care one but about what\u2019s going on around them. If she was okay with it and these activities aren\u2019t endangering then there was no need question like you did. It\u2019s fair enough if you don\u2019t want a baby\u2019s there, but you need to be honest and tell her that.

They're 2 months old, they won't remember anything, so that is not a reason not to have them there. I think the truth is that you just don't want a baby around for whatever reason (and that is ok, it is your stagette).\n\nDo what you want. Just own it though, just say you'd rather not have a baby there and if that means she can't come then please don't. I don't see the big deal at all if hubby is just off in the other corner watching their baby, that man is a saint for agreeing to follow you guys around all day with a 2 month old, but if you feel that strongly about a baby and the father being in the same building as you guys.... well, that's your right, but I'd say at that point that YTA.", "NTA.

This is a hen party, not a \u201cMommy and Me\u201d event (and yes, I am a parent and adore kids). \n\nAlso, 2-month-olds are still newborns and need tons of sleep and can get very fussy, especially at night (at least mine was).

At that point, the only thing you are doing is showing your friends you don't trust your partner to parent their own kid for a few hours.\n\nThat's an awful environment for a baby from a safety standpoint.
