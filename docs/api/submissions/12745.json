I announced my engagement last year in January and asked my best friends to be bridesmaids. One friend (Lucy 32f) was already pregnant (would have a 6 month old at the wedding) and a month or two after another (Sarah 33f) announced she was pregnant (would have a 3 month old at the wedding) non of which bothered me in the slightest. I requested the babies didn't come to the ceremony but are more than welcome for the rest of the day.\n\nBoth babies have been born now and both Lucy and Sarah have been exclusively breastfeeding. Lucy has eventually managed to get her little one to feed from a bottle (this is off her own back with no pressure from me, I understand the children are young and it can be difficult to leave them for a full day) just in time for the hen party which is Saturday. Sarah is having trouble with this and has announced that her SO will be around the bars we will be in with her baby so he can bring the baby to her to feed. I'm not sure this is appropriate and told her one bar specifically doesn't allow children, to which she replied 'Oh, SO will have to go next door then'. Turns out she had planned for her SO and baby to be in the bars with us just at a different table. I told her if it's that much stress for her maybe just come to lunch and then go home to her child. She said that no, she doesn't mind breastfeeding her at the bar and it will be fine.\n\nThe other bridesmaids and I were quite confused and said surely you're not suggesting bringing your 2 month old child on a hen party? I told her straight there would be drinking, swearing and god knows what else going on and it's just not appropriate, which she took offence at and is now hardly talking to any of us. My question is, was I too harsh? Is it okay for her SO to follow us around bars and restaurants with their baby? AITA?\n\nEDIT\n\n1. To be clear - she won't be drinking at the bachelorette, so no problem with breastfeeding.\n2.

It's your party and infants generally don't belong in bars lol", "NAH - I mean, that doesn't sound like much fun for her? But I suppose if she wants to step away for a bit every few hours to feed her baby that's not the worst thing in the world. Not saying breastfeeding/being a parent is a medical issue, but in this context I would say it is similar to someone who has to step away to check to their insulin every couple of hours - a pain for her but not a burden on anyone else. Its not as if she is planning on bringing the baby around with her in stroller. \n\nI can see why this might feel weird to you - knowing she may be distracted by this, having her SO as a semi-participant in the hen party. But it honestly sounds like she tried to come up with the least intrusive way possible to still participate in the hen party while also caring for her child. \n\nI can pretty much assure you that if this ends up being a problem for anyone, it is going to be her and her SO, not you or the rest of the party. I doubt they will last more than a few places before this becomes too much for them or the baby.   \n\nTBH - I am guessing that she is struggling right now. It is incredibly hard for people who are exclusively breastfeeding because it severely limits the amount of time they can have for themselves. As much as she loves her baby, she is probably dying for some adult time. \n\nI don't think you need to change any of your plans for your hen party or alter your behavior in any way during the hen party to accommodate her plan, but I do think it would be gracious of you to tell her that if she wants to try and make this work that it is ok with you.", "NTA but I think there's a compromise to be made here. It sounds like she's really going out of her way to try and be there for you. I get why you don't want him in the actual venues you'll be in but if he can hold up nearby and she's willing to pop out every 3 hours then that kinda sounds like a win/win.", "NAH.

You\u2019re right that bars are not the most friendly places for babies, but a two month old is not going to be bothered by swearing or anything else happening tbh. Sarah is going out of her way to ensure that she can be there to support you while also making sure that her baby is fed. \n\nBaby and SO don\u2019t need to stick around all night though - once baby has been fed there\u2019s no need.

She didn't care, I didn't care, everyone was happy. \n\nThere is a compromise to be made, you and your sister just need to come to an agreement! \n\nBut never the asshole for not wanting kids at your special event.

Sounds like she's struggling to prioritise.", "NTA people need to get over themselves.  \n\nI have a bunch of kids and my wife has breastfed.  \n\nEach mother has to ask themselves why they are breastfeeding and how they're going to manage it.  If they want to be the exclusive feeder, god bless them - fine.  It requires sacrifice.  Too many of these people want to make a show of it and let everyone know what an awesome mom they are.  Great.  Congratulations.\n\nMy wife pumped during off cycles/etc.  This allowed us to freeze spare milk and me to get up with the baby at night.

I also thought you couldn\u2019t drink while breastfeeding or had to wait so many hours.", "Uh, NTA. She's cracked though to think that bringing any child, especially a baby, to a bar. You've offered reasonable solutions, and maybe it's post-partum pregnancy hormones making her act this way, but she being incredibly unreasonable.", "There is a time and place and baby\u2019s don\u2019t belong at a hens or at a bar \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. I don't have kids, but even I think it is a bad idea to tote a 2 month old baby around to various bars. Even if Sarah's SO is doing the actual toting. Let's point out the various drawbacks. Bars are loud & there is always the potential for mishaps ie; Fights, spills, drunk people tripping into the SO/baby. And then Sarah has to take time to feed the baby. So, her attention isn't going to be completely with the hen party anyway. Can Sarah pump enough milk to leave SO & her baby home? That would be only way I could see this working. \n\nSo no, you weren't being too harsh.", "OMG... a grown woman thinks her SO dragging a baby around an entire day or night from bar to bar is acceptable parenting?  Also, why???  If she is drinking, the baby can't have any of that milk anyway, so she will need to pump and dump - making the effort to follow and hold breastfeeding sessions completely useless.  This is not an appropriate  solution for the party, your friend, but most of all the baby.\n\nNTA and your friend thinking this is accpeatble is either a shitty parent or a selfish stupid friend.  With parenting comes compromise...", "YTA. There's nothing inherently wrong with bringing a baby to a party venue and there's no harm at all in breastfeeding a baby after a few drinks. The harm would be handling a baby if you're too drunk, but dad would be there anyway so that would be a non issue for her. Separating a mother and baby can cause enormous amounts of separation anxiety in both parent and baby, and she was trying her best to be able to be at your hen party anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One big one is that you\u2019ve got another new mom present who might be looking forward to enjoying time with her friends and not thinking about babies for one night. If she went to the trouble of arranging childcare, she may be especially annoyed by not being able to unplug from baby talk that night.\n\nIt can definitely change the dynamic of the party to have one guest with their mind half there and half outside. If you don\u2019t mind that, that\u2019s fine.

If you want her there until she needs to leave, that\u2019s also legit; maybe offer her joining you for one of the bars and staying until she gets a text from her SO that she\u2019s needed? I know a lot of people who planned weekend bachelorette events where a new mom joined the party for a full day and then headed home, if that was feasible with their feeding plan\u2014 obviously not the case here, but people make arrangements that allow them to stay as long as they can leave real life at the door. I\u2019ve known friends who had to do this to accommodate work obligations\u2014 because again, the hen party is about suspending real life responsibilities for a while and enjoying your friends before a major life change, and no one is there to hear someone field calls and deal with work.\n\nIt\u2019s really up to you what you want the evening to be like, but as soon as you start talking about how she or her baby is going to be affected, you\u2019re overstepping.", "NTA adults need adult only spaces and events.", "NTA...\"You brought a baby?

He could order a soda and some food.  \nNot everyone at bars are drinking alcholic beverages and its weird you seem to think they have to if they are there.", "Ok but this is also a compromise. Why did you argue the minor points all over this thread when you agreed all along with the basic principle?", "I don't agree.  The basic premise is having a baby in a bar all day while mom parties. It's a shitty idea.", "A hen party is no place for a baby, let alone one being held at multiple bars. The mom should know this without being told and since she\u2019s exclusively nursing should have bowed out of the evening festivities. NTA", "This is her best effort to compromise to show up for YOU. I don't think she's an AH or being selfish. She's doing her best to be in the place she needs and the one she so desperately wants. I have absolutely gone to something with friends, and my husband has dropped by when my baby needed nursed and then left with our child. It could work.", "This is really irresponsible of your friend to have her 2 month old baby in bars all night, wtf?? Tell her to stay home.", "NTA, I would kindly excuse her. Super weird to bring a baby into that environment in my opinion. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s going a bit stir crazy and wants a night to let loose but a hen party with baby on the breast is not the time or place. It might be nice to organise something for her separate to your wedding - maybe a girls\u2019 night at her place so SO can be readily on hand with infant?- but your hen do is not the one.", "NTA.

People shouldn't bring their kids to bars or anything adjacent, newborns or not", "NTA. \n\nIt's not an appropriate thing to bring a baby to, and not really an appropriate thing to bring an SO to, even if he's at a different table.\n\nI totally understand her not wanting to leave the baby alone, but that's when you gracefully bow out of the event. That's just part of being a parent, especially when your children are young.", "WTF!?!?\n\nAnd her SO agreed to this!?!? As a woman who has had, and ebf two kids for 6 months,  this sounds like hell on earth to me.

It\u2019s an unfortunate predicament for her, but OP is NTA for suggesting this is not ideal.", "NTA", "NTA. There's some things you can't do for a while after you have a baby because being a parent comes before entertainment and friends, and babies are vulnerable and loud.

They're only correcting you on that one single point in your original comment, because there are people out there that do not know or understand that some babies just do not take to bottle.
