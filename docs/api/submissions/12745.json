I announced my engagement last year in January and asked my best friends to be bridesmaids. One friend (Lucy 32f) was already pregnant (would have a 6 month old at the wedding) and a month or two after another (Sarah 33f) announced she was pregnant (would have a 3 month old at the wedding) non of which bothered me in the slightest. I requested the babies didn't come to the ceremony but are more than welcome for the rest of the day.\n\nBoth babies have been born now and both Lucy and Sarah have been exclusively breastfeeding. Lucy has eventually managed to get her little one to feed from a bottle (this is off her own back with no pressure from me, I understand the children are young and it can be difficult to leave them for a full day) just in time for the hen party which is Saturday. Sarah is having trouble with this and has announced that her SO will be around the bars we will be in with her baby so he can bring the baby to her to feed. I'm not sure this is appropriate and told her one bar specifically doesn't allow children, to which she replied 'Oh, SO will have to go next door then'. Turns out she had planned for her SO and baby to be in the bars with us just at a different table. I told her if it's that much stress for her maybe just come to lunch and then go home to her child. She said that no, she doesn't mind breastfeeding her at the bar and it will be fine.\n\nThe other bridesmaids and I were quite confused and said surely you're not suggesting bringing your 2 month old child on a hen party? I told her straight there would be drinking, swearing and god knows what else going on and it's just not appropriate, which she took offence at and is now hardly talking to any of us. My question is, was I too harsh? Is it okay for her SO to follow us around bars and restaurants with their baby? AITA?\n\nEDIT\n\n1. To be clear - she won't be drinking at the bachelorette, so no problem with breastfeeding.\n2.

But I suppose if she wants to step away for a bit every few hours to feed her baby that's not the worst thing in the world. Not saying breastfeeding/being a parent is a medical issue, but in this context I would say it is similar to someone who has to step away to check to their insulin every couple of hours - a pain for her but not a burden on anyone else. Its not as if she is planning on bringing the baby around with her in stroller. \n\nI can see why this might feel weird to you - knowing she may be distracted by this, having her SO as a semi-participant in the hen party. But it honestly sounds like she tried to come up with the least intrusive way possible to still participate in the hen party while also caring for her child. \n\nI can pretty much assure you that if this ends up being a problem for anyone, it is going to be her and her SO, not you or the rest of the party. I doubt they will last more than a few places before this becomes too much for them or the baby.   \n\nTBH - I am guessing that she is struggling right now. It is incredibly hard for people who are exclusively breastfeeding because it severely limits the amount of time they can have for themselves. As much as she loves her baby, she is probably dying for some adult time. \n\nI don't think you need to change any of your plans for your hen party or alter your behavior in any way during the hen party to accommodate her plan, but I do think it would be gracious of you to tell her that if she wants to try and make this work that it is ok with you.", "NTA but I think there's a compromise to be made here. It sounds like she's really going out of her way to try and be there for you. I get why you don't want him in the actual venues you'll be in but if he can hold up nearby and she's willing to pop out every 3 hours then that kinda sounds like a win/win.", "NAH.

You\u2019re right that bars are not the most friendly places for babies, but a two month old is not going to be bothered by swearing or anything else happening tbh. Sarah is going out of her way to ensure that she can be there to support you while also making sure that her baby is fed. \n\nBaby and SO don\u2019t need to stick around all night though - once baby has been fed there\u2019s no need.

Sounds like she's struggling to prioritise.", "NTA people need to get over themselves.  \n\nI have a bunch of kids and my wife has breastfed.  \n\nEach mother has to ask themselves why they are breastfeeding and how they're going to manage it.  If they want to be the exclusive feeder, god bless them - fine.  It requires sacrifice.  Too many of these people want to make a show of it and let everyone know what an awesome mom they are.  Great.  Congratulations.\n\nMy wife pumped during off cycles/etc.  This allowed us to freeze spare milk and me to get up with the baby at night.

I also thought you couldn\u2019t drink while breastfeeding or had to wait so many hours.", "Uh, NTA. She's cracked though to think that bringing any child, especially a baby, to a bar. You've offered reasonable solutions, and maybe it's post-partum pregnancy hormones making her act this way, but she being incredibly unreasonable.", "There is a time and place and baby\u2019s don\u2019t belong at a hens or at a bar \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. I don't have kids, but even I think it is a bad idea to tote a 2 month old baby around to various bars. Even if Sarah's SO is doing the actual toting. Let's point out the various drawbacks. Bars are loud & there is always the potential for mishaps ie; Fights, spills, drunk people tripping into the SO/baby. And then Sarah has to take time to feed the baby. So, her attention isn't going to be completely with the hen party anyway. Can Sarah pump enough milk to leave SO & her baby home? That would be only way I could see this working. \n\nSo no, you weren't being too harsh.", "OMG... a grown woman thinks her SO dragging a baby around an entire day or night from bar to bar is acceptable parenting?  Also, why???  If she is drinking, the baby can't have any of that milk anyway, so she will need to pump and dump - making the effort to follow and hold breastfeeding sessions completely useless.  This is not an appropriate  solution for the party, your friend, but most of all the baby.\n\nNTA and your friend thinking this is accpeatble is either a shitty parent or a selfish stupid friend.  With parenting comes compromise...", "YTA. There's nothing inherently wrong with bringing a baby to a party venue and there's no harm at all in breastfeeding a baby after a few drinks. The harm would be handling a baby if you're too drunk, but dad would be there anyway so that would be a non issue for her. Separating a mother and baby can cause enormous amounts of separation anxiety in both parent and baby, and she was trying her best to be able to be at your hen party anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe y'all need to arrange a new Mum support date for her that involves no wedding talk & mutual friends, where you turn up at hers. Everyone (*except your friend*) takes it in turns to watch the kids. While everyone else makes snacks, cleans, shares new Mum tips, shares new Mum struggles, drinks virgin cocktails. And separately to this support day, you explain how you understand how difficult it is to adjust to not being able to go to social events because of parenting. But unfortunately a hen do is one of those events.", "It\u2019s sad for your friend that the timing of her child being born threw a wrench into things for the hen party. But NTA. \n\nShe needs to keep her child far away from a bar at 2 months old. We\u2019re still recovering from a global pandemic for fuck sake. Why is this party seemingly more important than the safety of her infant?", "Nta.  Find a compromise.  Do a nice dinner that she can attend.  You can go out the rest of the night and she can go home.  She\u2019s still part of the night but she doesn\u2019t have to worry about being away from her child.", "NTA. Your party, your rules. \nHaving said that, I am a mom of four and my youngest would only eat breastmilk every two (!) hours. That was a nightmare, not being able to step out for longer that 120 minutes for six months straight. If this friend is really close to you, perhaps there is a compromise to be made (?). But that's up to you, of course.", "NTA. Pumping exists, this is the reason why. She can pump here and there the week before hand so her SO can have a supply of breast milk ready.", "Makes me think of Sweet Home Alabama\u2026 \u201cyou have a baby\u2026 in a bar\u201d", "And Sarah\u2019s SO just lurking at another table? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a wonderful man and not a creepy lurker, but it would be very odd for him and the baby to be sitting at another table while the ladies are trying to have a girls night.", "> SO will have to go next door then\n  \nMaybe I'm misreading but she says the dad will be nextdoor which presumably is not a bar.", "Yeah and I don't think dad should be drinking, so it's this guy hovering around taking care of a baby and not spending any money while his wife, who also isn't buying drinks, has fun 20 feet away and occasionally walks over to feed the baby?  That's just awkward.", "I doubt it's about missing the party for her. I'm assuming she's just trying to be there for her friend, the bride, as she's made a commitment to her.", "my first thought too!", "I thought the same but couldn't remember the movie title.", "Makes me think of this webcomic from [Alex Norris ](https://mobile.twitter.com/dorrismccomics/status/1139551726376292354)", "I doubt that's the way he wants to spend an evening, too.", "She also said the plan was for the husband to sit in the bar (she used the word bar several times) just st a different table", "I agree with you on all aspects but the milk dumping.. its not necessary. Once a mom sobers up her milk is fine, it's not like the alcohol stays in the milk after its left her bloodstream. Just sayin.", "Where are you getting the assumption of the baby being in a carseat all day? Dad might have baby in a pram, his arms or babywear them. All are perfectly fine options.", "Please don\u2019t spread false information about breastfeeding. Maybe do a bit of research first before you pass on judgement.", "Accurate", "So, have a 2 month old baby wait it out?  Maybe just give the baby a timelne based off consumption and have them hold off???.", "Yes, I guess a baby sitting in a buggy for hours \non end in a bar is a great idea.  The fact that people are arguing this as a solid plan is ridiculous.", "What false information?  A baby should not be breastfeeding while it's mother is actively consuming alcohol.  Babies genrally aren't going to hold\nold off breastfeeding until milk is safe.  If memory serves I did not have the ability to ask my breastfed infant to wait a few hours to sober up so they could eat.", "I'm not arguing that it's a solid plan, I'm just saying there's other options than a car seat. I know i was definitely out for several hours (not bars but shopping, meals etc) when my yo was that age. Parents don't have to stay in constantly", "It's not like car seat or play pen are the only options. Dad could have a baby carrier and baby wear. That would be fine all evening.\n\nI'm not sure how packed the bars will be, but babies don't necessarily need to stay home all the time. Going out sometimes with your baby is fine", "You're making huge assumptions. There's no doubt many options that don't involve having the kid in a packed venue or in a car all evening. I don't know why you're so pressed but it's giving me Maude Flanders vibes.", "So the problem is with the car seat? Just carry the baby for a bit then?", "\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "Please tell me how this plays out in your mind.", "There are a bunch of problems with this scenario.", "I'm saying you don't have to dump the milk, it's okay to breastfeed when you drink.
