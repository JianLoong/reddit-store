He should wear the Omega \u2014 a special watch for a special occasion.", "NTA. Time for your brother to grow up. Does he have a Livestrong bracelet he wants to wear too?", "**NTA**  as he asked you for your opinion in front of his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nIt\u2019s up to your cousin to sort out with his fianc\u00e9e. He should not have brought you into this, or at the least he should have asked you ahead of time to support him publicly, and not express your actual opinion.", "My cousin wore an Apple Watch on her wedding. No one cared.. why would they? \nI will wear my Apple Watch on my wedding day and if my boyfriend wants to as well, he can.\nI\u2019m all about closing those rings baby, if I\u2019m moving my watch has to see it ;P", "YTA", "NTA. This is a disagreement between OP's brother and the fiancee. He was trying to get OP to agree and gang up on the fiancee to -- what? pressure her to change her mind instead of communicating with her and coming to an agreement or compromise.\n\nHow is this supposed to work once they're married? When they disagree about how many children to have, will the brother call in OP as a deciding vote??? This is not your circus, not your monkeys, OP. If he didn't want your opinion, he shouldn't have asked for it.", "NTA.  I like my gadgets as much as the next guy, but there are fights worth fighting and fights that aren\u2019t worth fighting.  \u2018I gotta wear my smartwatch to my wedding\u201c isn\u2019t a fight worth fighting.", "Strong NTA", "NTA\n\nHe's more committed to his watch than his bride, which is a bit concerning.\n\nIf he doesn't want to wear the Omega, he doesn't have to, but it would probably look awesome.\n\nHe can get a metal band for the Apple watch to make it look like a traditional watch. It doesn't have to be bright yellow or black silicone. He can get a classy metal band for like $40 on Amazon if he's so dead set on marrying his fiancee and also his Apple watch.", "NTA.  Sounds like he loves the watch more than he loves his fiancee.  She may need to think twice about this marriage.", "INFO Why does the watch matter? If he can wear an Omega why can't he wear the Apple watch?", "NTA. You didn't lie to him so he's mad? You're opinion isn't the same as his so you're being a bad friend? You're not in the wrong. You know you're not. Sorry your brother is acting wackadoo.", "I\u2019m not going to pass judgement. But I think some compromise could be offered! For example I think it\u2019d be ok if brother only wore the watch during the reception! After all the formal photos are done. I know at least in my area photography is expensive and I\u2019d be annoyed at the Apple Watch, especially if they\u2019re spending money to make a formal event, BUT I do think he should be allowed to have a say in how he dresses.   maybe take some photos with the watch on and some with it off.  Or just take it off during the ceremony.", "YTA. So is the fiancee.\n\nHe likes his watch. Let him wear the damn thing.\n\nIf the fiancee is so worried about it looking ridiculous then she's already going into this with the wrong attitude.", "NTA if I was fianc\u00e9 this would be such a turn off", "NTA' Id totally side with your brother if what he wanted to wear was a sentimental bit of jewellery that didn't go with the tux like an heirloom watch or something not sure I get why he's so desperate not to take his apple watch off.", "Look, I think people who are obsessed with Apple are annoying as hell. But it's his wedding. He gets to decide what he wants to wear, and if his fiancee disagrees, that's for them to work out.

No.", "NAH - I would think seeing the heart rate data from the moment you say \"I do\" would be wonderful.", "YTA\n\nEverybody has the right to be comfortable during his own wedding. His wedding, his rules. He doesn't harm anyone.", "Eh, it's his wedding too and he should be able to reflect his personality in the wedding - which is apparently Apple Watch fanboy (?).

Who wouldn't want that on their wedding day? \n\nAnd if he still won't wear it could you put it in the post to me as I'd definitely give it a good home.", "Ohhh! That's interesting.", "I was going to suggest a photoshoot of the groom with his watch lol", "Just because people do it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right. You\u2019re not supposed to wear any watch with a tuxedo.

Or have I misunderstood that it is a wedding and both people should get to have an accessory they like? A watch is just so inconsequential and he even admitted he would wear a black band.

It's not about that so don't make it about that.", "Not just I do, I would imagine you'd see a good spike when she first walks out.\n\nCould probably integrate those results into a wedding video in a really cool way, honestly.", "Presumably he still has both legs, so the Apple Watch can go on an ankle.", "And who cares if it does? It's not like it would invalidate the wedding, lol.\n\nI don't see any harm coming from this guy wearing the watch he wants to during HIS WEDDING.", "But what if a message comes in?

Why should he have to change who he is \u201cjust for one day\u201d? \n\nI suspect the brother is on the spectrum and it\u2019s a social coping mechanism, which would be even more important for an occasion like this.", "Nah, fuck that. It's his wedding. Anyone who gives a fuck if he's wearing an apple watch, or any watch, with a tuxedo, at his own wedding, needs to reevaluate their priorities.", "Apple Watches are not appropriate to wear with formal wear.", "I highly doubt that - you really think AITA would call a man not the asshole for trying to control his future wife's accessories at their wedding?", "Well his soon to be wife obviously does. \n\nBlack tie is one of the few times where there\u2019s an established set of rules. One can break the rules but they exist for a reason; that is to make the wearer look good.", "He could ... or he could wear watch he likes too. Apple watch is a watch. It is actually ok to wear watch you like during your wedding. Or earrings you like. Or whatever.\n\nIt is not like he insisted on something ridiculous or shameful. He wants to wear perfectly normal watch for 2022. \n\nDemanding grandpas watch is definitely weirder.", "What if your cellphone in your pocket or purse does the same? Really not a big deal. First, you can mute notifications. Second, if it beeps then the marriage is still valid. The fiance is entitled to be annoyed and others are entitled to make fun of him. Which is about the worst that would happen, really.", "And so what? Are the formal wear police gonna come and arrest this guy if he wears this watch?\n\nHe wants to wear this for his wedding. Let him.

There\u2019s no official rule book for formal wear haha", "She's allowed to care, but making this big of a deal over it makes her an asshole, imo.\n\nLet him wear the watch that he wants to, if she cares that much over his looks that she's prioritizing that over him being able to wear what he wants then that's a whole different problem.\n\nWhy should he have to compromise on this one accessory that he wants?", "What about an apple watch with a black leather strap looks so informal though", "So if he wanted to wear flip flops that\u2019s okay?

They\u2019re an informal accessory.", "There's a big difference between wearing flip flops and a watch.\n\nShoes are clothing, a watch is an accessory.\n\nAnybody who cares that he's wearing a watch here does not have the right attitude. The important thing is supposed to be these two people getting married, not what he has on his wrist."]}
