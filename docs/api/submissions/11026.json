I hope he wears it, bright yellow strap and all.", "If groom *thought of and used* the argument of seeing his heart spike at the various emotion spots, then I\u2019d agree with the black band.  But, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.  He should consider wearing his \u201csomething old\u201d, to please dad and remember grandpa. That would be sweet. \n\nHe needs to evaluate WHY wearing an electronic gadget is important to him on a day when \u201cbe here now\u201d is vital.", "YTA", "YTA and so is everyone else telling him he can't wear what he wants. It's his wedding too. Lord knows we are not allowed to tell a bride shit about anything to do with what she wears so why is it ok to do to the groom? This man loves his damn watch so he shouldn't be fighting to wear it.", "YTA. It's HIS wedding too. He should get to decide what he wears. You would probably never dare to tell the bride what to wear on her wedding day, so what makes people think it's okay to tell the groom what to wear?\n\nThe fact that his fiance won't let him wear something that he loves so much to his own wedding is a huge red flag for me. I wouldn't want to marry someone who thinks they can dictate what I wear, especially at an insanely expensive party I'm paying for like a wedding.", "NTA. Your brother is being ridiculous, and ultimately it is between him and his fiancee. Is the stupid Apple watch so important? Is he going to look fondly back at his wedding photos to see which version he wore while being married? Lord.", "I agree with your dad.  Wear grandpa's watch.  This is ridiculous.", "NTA - How old is the groom? He sounds like a 13 year old wanting to show how cool he is.  He should realize he can go without his plastic toy for a few hours.", "Esh. It's the bride and groom wedding and no one's opnions matter except the bride and groom. Fucker wants to wear the watch it's not your place to say if he can or cannot", "NAH. Your brother is just\u2026. Sad\u2026.", "So if he\u2019s bringing his favorite electric toy to the wedding, can the bride bring her\u2019s too? Maybe make it a part of the bouquet? NTA", "Sounds like brother should marry his apple watch.", "NTA\n\nBut what the heck??\n\nI'm guessing part of the reason the bride to be wants there to be no apple watch is because of how much your brother pays attention to and talks about this accessory and she's trying to get him to be focused on the  wedding. \n\nI feel like they should do couples counseling before getting married to make sure they're on the same page.", "YTA. It\u2019s his wedding. He can wear whatever he wants, and needs no permission.", "Holy shit, talk about first world problems.  If you all are fighting over this, than ETA.", "Strong disagree. I'll repeat what I said to OP:\n\n> Has it ever occurred to you (or his fiancee) that since (yes) his watch tracks everything it will forever track the moment his heart kicked up watching his bride walk down the aisle? That its biometrics during his wedding day will be something he gets to keep forever if he wore the watch on his wedding day? No, because that would actually require you to actually listen to your brother about why he likes his Watch. Instead you dismiss his fondness for his watch as him being shallow/showing off which is rich considering YOU LITERALLY SUGGESTED AN EXPENSIVE WATCH WHOSE SOUL PURPOSE IS TO SHOW OFF as an alternative.\n\nOP should've backed his brother when it came to wearing a black strap with his watch. And it doesn't make his brother childish for wanting to wear an Apple Watch during his wedding.", "He responded with his perspective, and went on to belittle him.\n\nThe opinion doesn\u2019t make him an AH, but the way he expressed it certainly did.", "Seconded re the Apple eyerolling -- not all ardent Apple users are fanboi weirdos who have gear instead of personalities, but the groom sure is.", "while I agree with your observation, just thought I should let you know that Asperger\u2019s is not used anymore it\u2019s just Autism Spectrum Disorder. Mostly because high functioning and low functioning autism is not a real thing and also because Hans Asperger was a literal Nazi", "I think it's pretty rich for a 5-time Asshole Enthusiast to call it a red flag that someone is enthusiastic about their iDevice. How much time do you spend on reddit on your iPhone/Android/whateverthefuckbook?", "Strong disagree.

It was a fair compromise.", "Wearing an apple watch is a little like strapping a smart phone to your wrist - and if there is one day you should really disconnect from your smartphone it is your wedding day.  I can imagine being worried he would poke at his watch during the ceremony to bring attention to it.", "Agreed. If one must wear a watch with their tuxedo an Omega is the perfect choice.", "Thanks. I was unaware of Asperger\u2019s questionable background but have met many people with symptoms like this in my line if work (engineers and scientists)", "I meant the fact that op is a child.", "You are making some very good points here. If I were the bride I would accept the I watch with the black strap, but I would certainly check the biometrics.", "If he does that then sure he'd be an asshole. But that's conjecture... this is supposed to be his day too, what's wrong otherwise with letting him wear what he wants to wear? This whole thread comes across so controlling and judgmental.", "I wore my Apple Watch on my wedding day. I found a cute band made of faux pearls. I like wearing my watch. It\u2019s not like I needed to answer phone or text messages. I just like being able to track my steps and things like that. I didn\u2019t look at anyone or anything else except my husbands eyes, our hand fasting cord, and our rings on our wedding day. The groom likes the Apple Watch. I don\u2019t see what the big deal is. The bride knows what he\u2019s like. I\u2019m assuming he\u2019ll have on long sleeves since he\u2019s wearing a tux.", "How is that any more of a worry than anybody playing with their smart phone during the ceremony?\n\nIf he does that, then yes he's an asshole. But that doesn't mean it's okay to treat him like a child who can't control himself by preventing him from wearing the watch in the first place.", "This is a really weird question. It\u2019s an electronic device meant to be worn at literally any hour, you can turn off the sounds and such.", "It doesn't say anywhere he was directly asked. He said he feels he was expected to agree with him.", "Yeah I only found out recently myself because I thought I had Aspergers so I was researching it and found out all this information from fellow autistic people. So it\u2019s understandable you wouldn\u2019t know. \n\nAnd I agree, because it seems like he has too strong of a connection to the Apple Watch for it to just be about wanting to wear a cool accessory. Especially considering how often he brings up the Apple Watch even though it clearly annoys people around him I do the same thing with my special interest so that makes sense to me. \n\nMaybe we\u2019re wrong and he\u2019s just really stubborn but it just seems like a weird hill to die on without having some underlying reason.", "OP is a child why exactly? For wanting to choose what watch he wears at his own wedding?\n\nIf anything, his fiancee trying to control what he wears should be a red flag to him.", ">\tBlack tie is one of the few times where there\u2019s an established set of rules.\n\nI\u2019m confused here, can you show me the \u201cApple Watches aren\u2019t black tie\u201d rule? I\u2019ve worn my Apple Watch to every black tie event I\u2019ve been to for the past few years, and had no second glances. Just throw an appropriate band on it, and no one bats an eye.", "I mention it not so much because of the noise, I have one and I always use it on vibration, I mention it because I have a friend who is obsessed with that type of watch, and she is doing what she is doing, if something happens to her, the first thing she does is check it I notify you, a boss has already called you out for doing that during important meetings", "Shhh, the formal wear police might see this comment! \ud83e\udee5", "I just googled \"tuxedo with Apple watch\" after all the comments against it, and it looks like any other watch.", "No watch with black tie is fairly well established although with the popularity of James Bond\u2019s dive watches and the loosening of dress codes since the 60s many people do anyway. It comes from an early 20th century idea that looking at your watch while talking to someone is impolite because you\u2019re implying you have a better use of your time. \n\nAn Apple Watch specifically isn\u2019t a dress watch and by that rule it\u2019s inappropriate for formal occasions although once again, that doesn\u2019t really stop people. As it is a useful tool one can definitely get away with it in a business setting but if one wishes to follow the dress code to the T it\u2019s best to go for a proper dress watch like the aforementioned Omega.\n\nThat\u2019s two strikes against wearing an Apple Watch with black tie. You can definitely do it but once again, it\u2019s like wearing calf height socks or button cuffed shirts. It\u2019s a small detail but still not correct.\n\nLook up an article or video speaking about black tie if you want to learn more.", ">\tsame as it would not be okay if he tried to prevent her from wearing a necklace or something that she wants to.\n\nIt\u2019s worse than that.

But even if he couldn\u2019t, he could just turn on DND for the extent of the ceremony.", "More like if she can't deal with such a trivial thing, there's a problem.", "Exactly. Hell, when the yellow was pointed out as an issue, the brother realized it would look silly and intended to get an appropriate band. At that point it\u2019s just a nice watch, and anyone pushing him to wear a different one is being an AH.", "It looks off to the people that know the details of the black tie dress code. Most people wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with a notched lapel tuxedo or a black loafers but both aren\u2019t correct under the dress code.", "I never dismissed him as childish, so I dont know why you're responding to me. He gets the biometrics- what about the pictures? what if she doesn't care to see it in their pictures, which are also something to keep forever and probably cost a lot of money as well?", "I've worn both normal watches and smart watches, not that it actually matters at all to what's being discussed.", "He could even get the black stainless steel band if it's an issue with the sporty type band. This is a weird hill for the bride to die on.", "My wedding was black tie and I have been to several black tie events since then and I can guarantee nobody would have been like \"OMG look at the groom wearing an apple watch that's so tacky\". To me, it's just a really weird hill to die on for her. This is something her groom wants for himself, and it is both of their day, not just hers. If the whole wedding is going to be ruined over a watch there a bigger problems. They can find a compromise push it up or take it off during posed pictures, put the black stainless steel band on it to dress it up a little.  If he doesn't get a say in her attire (maybe he did who knows) she shouldn't get a say in the watch he wants to wear.", "Given that's its his wedding as much as it is hers, it's perfectly fine for him to bend the rules of what's acceptable or not under their dress code.\n\nI swear, people here are acting like he's trying to wear a Borat onesie to this instead of just the watch that he wants.", "If she resents looking at photos where her husband is happy and celebrating their love I'm the exact outfit that makes him most happy... Who exactly is putting who over their partner? Certainly not the husband who compromised with the black watch. Certainly the wife who complains someone instantly turns into a spy for wearing a normal watch.", ">it's more than a watch and that's easy to see by just... looking at the screen?\n\nAnd so what if people do see that? It's not like it would invalidate their wedding or anything. 99% of people out there wouldn't even notice it, and of those who do, I'm sure 99% of them wouldn't give the slightest of shits.", "He'll still be in the pictures, in a tux, her in a dress, everyone dressed up. Yet he can't have this ONE thing?\n\nThat seems beyond selfish to me.", "Yes, it matters. So, would you mind answering?", "I don\u2019t know about that. They kind of people who would notice and consider it tacky are also not the kind of people to point it out on his wedding day.", "Formal attire and Apple Watch do not belong in the same sentence", "but you know who does give a shit? his fiance, the one person whose opinion he should consider listening to, as it's her wedding as well.", "more selfish than being unable to wear a watch for one day? ok", "Fair, but they are also the kind of people I wouldn't want at my wedding anyway. To each their own though.", "Anybody who cares more about the fact that his apple watch doesn't match his formal attire, over the actual wedding/marriage, needs to have their priorities checked.", "Yeah, and that's makes her an asshole for giving more of a shit how they'll look in pictures than her husband, who she supposedly loves, wearing the watch he wants to.", "When the person is already doing everything else you asked of them for that day, yeah it is more selfish.\n\nLike seriously, imagine you wear what someone else told you to wear, eat what they told you to eat, smile when they tell you to smile, dance when they want you to dance, how they want you to dance, during the song they picked out. Yet they have the nerve to say YOU'RE being selfish because the only thing you want is to wear a specific watch while doing it all?"]}
