Why don't you wear grandpa's Omega?\"\n\nOur grandfather left each of his grandkids a watch from his collection when he passed. My brother got a beautiful vintage Omega De Ville on a crocodile strap that would look brilliant with a tux.\n\nI guess his fiance didn't even know that he owned a vintage dress watch. She's now made it perfectly clear she expects him to wear it.\n\nMy brother is PISSED. He says if I hadn't brought up the Omega, she would have eventually agreed to let him wear his Apple Watch even if it wasn't with the strap he wanted. I'm his brother, his best man, it's his wedding too and I betrayed him.\n\nBe brought our parents into it and they're divided. Mom thinks I should have supported him, I know the Apple Watch is important to him and maybe he could have worn it if I backed him up. Our dad thinks this is ridiculous, and further thinks it would be a nice tribute to Grandad to wear his watch at the wedding (I agree).\n\nHe's really upset about it though, and maybe I should have just backed him up and let him be happy making his Apple Watch part of his wedding.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677466738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11d0vws/aita_for_not_supporting_my_brother_wanting_to_get/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OTOH if he wore a plain black strap chances are it wouldn\u2019t matter and nobody would even give it a second thought.\n\nThere\u2019s already enough drama surrounding weddings and whatever option causes the least stress for the couple is the one they should go with.\n\nPersonally I would just take it off during the ceremony and photos.
