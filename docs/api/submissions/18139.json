My daughters budgeted well and would save that extra cash and use it for outings.\n\nMy son on the other hand keeps buying breakfast instead of eating at home, or buying double lunch. Usually by Thursday he doesn\u2019t have money for food. Since it was new system I bailed him out when it happened. I stopped after Easter since he was not learning. So missing lunch was going to be a natural consequence.\n\nAnyways he spent all him money this week again and has to skip lunch. We got in an argument about how I\u2019m not feeding him.
