You even said, it doesn't actually block you from getting in or prevent you from getting out. It is just a minor convenience and you are mad for what? You even state realistically it doesn't effect you unless a delivery truck. Amazon parks on the road and walks packages to the door all the time and how often are you ordering large items like a new fridge where they would actually need to get into your driveway? No let's also be honest, what time does the garbage men come my guess is no where near the time of this school pick up or drop off. Why does this car bother you so much? School parking can be a real pain and she is just trying to get her kid home. The second your driveway is actually blocked I would be right with you complaining but that is not happening.

If we all chill out a bit the world will be better all round.", "YTA I'm assuming it's not easy to find parking at drop off and pick up, and it can probably be quite stressful for parents. And you don't know what else they might have going on, young kids, sick parents, pressure to get back to work quickly etc etc And they are somewhat considerate if the car is only ever there for a few minutes. I think leave them to it, unless there's actually an issue, and in that case I would talk to them about it rather than just tell them not to park there. Being nice can make such a big difference to people, and being an asshole can have a big impact on people too.", "YTA.

TBH you just don't like them parking there. which I get, it is annoying, but it is public highway, so little you can do unless the council are prepared to zig zag or put double yellow lines in front of your drop kerb. which will mean you wont be able to park there either. sorry but that's my verdict", "YATA\n\nYou should probably move.
