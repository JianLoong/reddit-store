Remember that she must be heartbroken, her \"husband\" cheated on her after at least 5 years (since, remember, she left to live with her then boyfriend). She really need emotional support right now. It's really not about the money, it's about the needs to be with you.\n\nFurthermore, I've read the comments. You said that your daughter coming back to you would be \"a step backwards\" in her independancy. How? She wanted support after being cheated on by her husband of 3 years/boyfriend of at least 5 years. That's a perfectly fine reaction from your daughter here. You are being too harsh, and you showed to her as a heartless mom here.\n\nAgain, YTA.", "\"She started to cry and said she just needs her mom right now.\"\n\nAnd you hold her at arm's length and just say \"you'll be fine\"?

Right now, they're all in  university and when they graduate, they'll all have the opportunity to get good-paying jobs. When that happens, they'll pay room and board and save money to move out. Let's face it, with houses and rent being so far out of reach for most young adults, they'll likely be with us for a number of years and that's fine. I not only love them, I like them. They're great company and great conversationalists. My parents were the same with my siblings and me. None of us had problems living on our own independently, and if any of us had a financial crisis and wanted to move back in with our parents, they were fine with it. It always felt so good to know they were always there for us right up till they passed away in their 90s. So, if one of my kids was in crisis, emotionally or physically, I'd have them back with us in a heartbeat if that's what they needed, including their children, whom I'd  love as my own. Again, this is how my parents were with their grandchildren. Not possessive, not interfering, just unconditional love. So maybe it depends on how you're raised, but I think OP is a rather heartless mom.", "You seem to have bought into the ideal that every person is an island and should go it alone.

She has two children (2 & 6 months). Recently, her husband revealed he\u2019s been cheating on her and is leaving her for another woman. They rent a house but due to my daughter having no credit at the time of moving in, only his name is on the lease. He is giving her 30 days to move out. \n\nMallory is understandably distraught. I\u2019ve been doing all I can to comfort her. She asked if she could move in with me, explaining she\u2019d have the kids every other week. She assured me she isn\u2019t looking for childcare. Both kids are in daycare. She offered to pay rent and chip in on groceries. \n\nNow, I have always raised my kids to be independent. I didn\u2019t kick them out at 18, but I did encourage them to start doing things on their own. Mallory moved out at 19 (moving in with her soon to be ex), my sons are in college and plan to move out after graduating from college (they\u2019re both freshmen at the same university). \n\nI asked Mallory how her credit score was. She said she could reasonably rent. I offered to pay first month, last month and a deposit, along with 6 months rent. She said it\u2019s not about the money. She\u2019s not wealthy by any means but she does well for herself and her husband is already agreeing to give her money weekly, even before they go to court. She just wants emotional support.\n\nI told her I could do that with her living in her own place. She started to cry and said she just needs her mom right now. I told her she was going to be okay.\n\nMy sons are pissed with me. They pointed out I have plenty of room, that Mallory has offered to pay rent. She\u2019s also not the type to shrug off responsibility of the kids and the toddler is well behaved. To me, that doesn\u2019t matter. They called me heartless.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can make whatever decisions you want but there are going to be consequences to this one and it could be permanent damage to your relationship with your kids", "The time to lean on someone is when you have been kicked and pushed down and SHE HAS BEEN PUSHED DOWN by this cheating revelation and you should be GIVING HER A HAND UP so that she can THEN stand on her own two feet.\n\nShe can\u2019t stand if she\u2019s sitting on her ass while you ask for her fucking credit score to give her a hand up.\n\nGive her the hand, she clearly has a good head on her shoulders, YOU LITERALLY SAY HER KID IS WELL BEHAVED AND SHE MANAGES DAY CARE FOR THEM. \n\nGive her a time limit if it makes you feel better, but good lord, help your damn kid.", "Ouch. What is she supposed to learn? My guess is she\u2019s learned pretty quickly that life sucks sometimes given her current circumstances.\n\nI don\u2019t think she necessarily needs your money.

This is not the best time to try and teach her a lesson in independence. Also, relying on people for support does not make you dependent.  It seems like she understands staying with you will be short-term, and she even offered to pay rent and said that you would not have to provide any childcare.  She needs some emotional support right now and hoped that she could get that from her mom and siblings. \n\nI am not going to make any judgements because, ultimately, it is your house. But I hope you'll consider what is more important to you - sticking to your idea of what it takes to make her independent, or being there for your daughter when she is verbalizing how she needs your emotional support.", "I agree with you.\n\nNTA\n\nLet her know she can always come over for the weekend and get her mom fix, but she needs to have her own place.", "[removed]", "There's a difference between constantly leaning on people and not being able to stand on your own, and being in a position where she really wants to lean on someone to share the load. \n\nUnless she's constantly attempting to get other people to carry her weight, you're being ridiculous and a massive AH.", "Wow\u2026I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s how you view this situation.

Sometimes people just need their mama", "Can you explain the rationale that moving back with family, paying the family rent, and providing groceries is \u201cless independent\u201d then having someone writing a check to cover thousands of dollars of bills?\n\nI am so curious as to what makes it different\u2026 other then you having to fill in the role of a caring mother to your distraught daughter. Other then the ability to not answer her phone calls or to not answer the door when she is seeking her mother, what benefits does this provide?\n\nYou\u2019re literally paying to not have to deal with your daughters emotional needs.", "Eh, I could agree but I wouldn't say \"undoubtedly\". \n\nPeople, especially kids can not only do stupid things but things despite what their parents think.", "Yes, OP is shooting herself in the foot because daughters usually are the ones left to take care of parents, especially the mother. Many sons do step up too but my experience has seen daughters doing it more", "Yeah, I understand having her and the kids move in is inconvenient but you can't always choose when somebody needs you.", "She fucked up a lot but she made up for it with the support.", ">  Going back to me is going backwards.\n\nLife doesn't always move forward.

And now her mother is asking her to just suck it all up and be independent. \n\nDon't be surprised when your kids don't want anything to do with you in your old age. No one's gonna come care for you, and no emotional support. Remember your words then \"be independent\", because that's all you'll be hearing. You see coming back for you should also be considered them moving backwards.\n\nYTA.", "Life isn't linear. Sheesh.", "Are you worried she isn\u2019t going to move out once she moves in? I think you can have her stay with you for a specific amount of time to get her life figured out (a month or whatever you two deem appropriate) but I don\u2019t think this is the time for tough love. I would also recommend trying to get her some counseling or therapy as she is going to need it. She can live on her own but immediately after having the rug ripped out from under her is not the time to try and make her prove it to you. You are kicking her while she is down", "You said that you pushed her to be independent- well she has been. She just wants her MOM. You gave birth to her, you in theory cared for her when she was little, maybe you kissed her scraps and braided her hair and told her things would be okay. \n\nThat\u2019s what she needs from you, and what she\u2019s asking for, for you to be with her, to help her heal. She\u2019s not trying to be a burden or a mooch.\n\nEdited for judgment: YTA", "You need to be honest with yourself (even if you don\u2019t comment here) would you really provide the emotional support?

Maybe if you hadn\u2019t made it clear your own children\u2019s presence in your vicinity was no longer welcome when they turned 18, she wouldn\u2019t have rushed into a marriage with a toxic dude who cheated on her and is now kicking his wife and CHILDREN to the curb with 30 days notice.\n\nPerhaps you should stop pushing your kids out of the frying pan and into the fire.", "Wait she even gave you a time frame??? Oh my fucking god, your kid is literally doing EVERYTHING right and you still think it isn\u2019t enough.", "You're not required to let anyone move in with you that you don't want living there, but your reasoning kind of stinks IMO. \n\nLiving with a husband does not make your daughter dependent. She is heartbroken and has openly said she wants the emotional support of her family while she grieves the loss of her marriage and you've denied her that. The fact that you value independence over her emotional well-being is pretty shitty.", "Wow, you are heartless.", "She is literally begging you to give her a few months of emotional support and your throwing it in her face. This is despicable. She's proven to you she can be independent. Money isn't the issue. YTA", "I'm not gonna question her need to learn to live independently but does she have to do that *now* on top of everything else? What's so terrible about allowing her to stay with you while she deals with the immediate crisis then independence?

The vast majority of us understood the ages perfectly, the commenter you\u2019re replying to is just being awkward.", "I would just like to piggyback off this to say your daughter probably feels pretty worthless right now. Her husband's cheating shattered her self esteem. And to.be rejected by her own mother has got to be unbearable.\n\nYou want your own space. As a parent, I totally get that and don't fault you for feeling that way. But our job never stops. She needs you now and you NEED to be there to help guide her.
