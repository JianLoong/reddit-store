Her finances are good and she can afford her own place, but her mental and emotional well-being have been destroyed.

Remember that she must be heartbroken, her \"husband\" cheated on her after at least 5 years (since, remember, she left to live with her then boyfriend). She really need emotional support right now. It's really not about the money, it's about the needs to be with you.\n\nFurthermore, I've read the comments. You said that your daughter coming back to you would be \"a step backwards\" in her independancy. How? She wanted support after being cheated on by her husband of 3 years/boyfriend of at least 5 years. That's a perfectly fine reaction from your daughter here. You are being too harsh, and you showed to her as a heartless mom here.\n\nAgain, YTA.", "\"She started to cry and said she just needs her mom right now.\"\n\nAnd you hold her at arm's length and just say \"you'll be fine\"?

Be that mom.", ">They called me heartless.\n\n\nI mean, your daughter came to you for support and you asked about her credit score.

You're already offering to subsidize a place for them.\n\nNAH.", "YTA. Shady Pines, Ma. Shady Pines!", "YTA.

It's not rocket science!", "YTA - Your daughter is going through something terrible\u2026the effects of which will be lasting. She has a hard road ahead of her. Seems like you would want to help her. This really seems cold-hearted.", "YTA. I'm very different from a lot of Reddit users. I have absolutely no problem with my kids living with me as long as they want to. My husband feels the same. Right now, they're all in  university and when they graduate, they'll all have the opportunity to get good-paying jobs. When that happens, they'll pay room and board and save money to move out. Let's face it, with houses and rent being so far out of reach for most young adults, they'll likely be with us for a number of years and that's fine. I not only love them, I like them. They're great company and great conversationalists. My parents were the same with my siblings and me. None of us had problems living on our own independently, and if any of us had a financial crisis and wanted to move back in with our parents, they were fine with it. It always felt so good to know they were always there for us right up till they passed away in their 90s. So, if one of my kids was in crisis, emotionally or physically, I'd have them back with us in a heartbeat if that's what they needed, including their children, whom I'd  love as my own. Again, this is how my parents were with their grandchildren. Not possessive, not interfering, just unconditional love. So maybe it depends on how you're raised, but I think OP is a rather heartless mom.", "You seem to have bought into the ideal that every person is an island and should go it alone. You should reassess that. The only reason humans are successful as a species is cooperation. Most other cultures incorporate that. America just has a bizarre obsession with denying it.

You can still support your daughter without having to live with her and her two kids 24/7.  As much as she claims she doesn't want free childcare, there's absolutely no way that you won't end up looking after those kids at least some of the time.  And being around a grieving woman with no opportunity for escape sounds exhausting. \n\nYou can support her from a comfortable distance.", "NAH. I understand where everyone here is coming from. But having two kids two and under in the house every other week is a huge ask. I do like the idea of a temporary situation. Give her a month or two and then help her find an apartment. She clearly needs the support and from what you\u2019ve said, she\u2019s never actually been independent so she\u2019s likely going to need some help. Additionally, she likely needs to build her credit history a little bit. Living with you for too long might actually hurt her future.", "YTA and a massive one. My daughter moved back home when her ex husband was cheating on her. All she wanted was her mom in her corner giving her the damm emotional support she needed.\nWasn't about rent or having the room for her. I never viewed her comming home as something backwards. It was something she needed to get her bearings in her new normal. And she had 3 kids and not once did she ask me to babysit.", "YTA but barely. This one is really tough.\n\nYou are willing to provide support which is great but you're avoiding what she's actually asking for. She's made it clear that it's not about money but emotional support which she feels needs physical closeness to get.\n\nIt's okay if you don't want her to move in to provide this emotional support but by offering money, you're sidestepping the actual request. Maybe a promise that you'll be available or an offer to help her find therapy or other support will be received better.\n\nI do think you put too much emphasis on her needing independence. She just found out that the person she thought was her lifetime partner is a cheating asshole.

It's reasonable that she needs some time to adjust to not having that team member.", "First, her name is not on the lease, but they are married with children. Ask advice from a lawyer before simply moving out. And if simply moving out, how much is hubby going to pay for the rent for his 'still' wife and their children?\n\nSecond. Let's face it.

I was in the near exact same situation as her, same age, with kids the same age, when I got divorced.

She has two children (2 & 6 months). Recently, her husband revealed he\u2019s been cheating on her and is leaving her for another woman. They rent a house but due to my daughter having no credit at the time of moving in, only his name is on the lease. He is giving her 30 days to move out. \n\nMallory is understandably distraught. I\u2019ve been doing all I can to comfort her. She asked if she could move in with me, explaining she\u2019d have the kids every other week. She assured me she isn\u2019t looking for childcare. Both kids are in daycare. She offered to pay rent and chip in on groceries. \n\nNow, I have always raised my kids to be independent. I didn\u2019t kick them out at 18, but I did encourage them to start doing things on their own. Mallory moved out at 19 (moving in with her soon to be ex), my sons are in college and plan to move out after graduating from college (they\u2019re both freshmen at the same university). \n\nI asked Mallory how her credit score was. She said she could reasonably rent. I offered to pay first month, last month and a deposit, along with 6 months rent. She said it\u2019s not about the money. She\u2019s not wealthy by any means but she does well for herself and her husband is already agreeing to give her money weekly, even before they go to court. She just wants emotional support.\n\nI told her I could do that with her living in her own place. She started to cry and said she just needs her mom right now. I told her she was going to be okay.\n\nMy sons are pissed with me. They pointed out I have plenty of room, that Mallory has offered to pay rent. She\u2019s also not the type to shrug off responsibility of the kids and the toddler is well behaved. To me, that doesn\u2019t matter. They called me heartless.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, I think your delivery was off for immediately asking about credit score and moving in (it felt like you were focusing on how the situation would impact you and not the impact its having onbthe daughter), I think you should apologize for that. For emotional support, I think its fair to tell the daughter to move close so you can visit and face time enough. I also think you should suggest your daughter go to therapy.

Having a place where they can settle down quickly seems like a good thing. It provides stability. \n\nI just can\u2019t be on board that this is asshole territory though.

I am last ditch effort trying to find family therapy, but OP ought to know that being this violently stingy with your kids in effort to teach them just makes your kids feel like you don't care about them. I can say this as someone dealing with this a little from the other side, but I can't even imagine how worse it is if you have kids yourself too.", "Yeah my cousin had her kids at a young age and their grandparents were the ones that raised them for all intents and purposes. She's in her mid-40s now and desperately trying to recapture her youth now that the kids have completely left the nest. It's just sad for everyone involved.", "You don\u2019t need to live with someone to receive emotional support. OP didn\u2019t say she and the kids couldn\u2019t visit every day or call her on the phone. She just said they couldn\u2019t live there and offered to financially support her for 6 months. Hell, OP didn\u2019t even say she wouldn\u2019t go visit her daughter if she needed it. If the daughter needs more hands on support than what she could get in a visit, then she probably needs to get a dog. \n\nOP is NTA", "This needs to be higher", "While reading it I thought that the only legitimate reason would be to help to build up her daughter\u2019s credit score. But I agree, the mother sounds like she just isn\u2019t very warm/loving. The daughter needs to not feel so alone and probably wants someone to talk to a bit. Now she has been betrayed by her ex and emotionally neglected by her mother.", "Even well behaved young kids that mom fully takes care if will still be incredibly disruptive to your life and household and peace. That is legitimate enough reason to not let her move in. She can still give emotional support loving separately.", "Nah...just the first month...", "My dad was an alcoholic and there were some rough times. My grandma always let my mom and us FOUR kids come and stay with her. My mom always told us we could always come home and I have told my daughter the same.", "Holy moly, you are messing up bad.\n\nLet her move in for 3 months, then help her find an apartment.

Just don\u2019t be surprised if she decides you should \u201clearn to live independently\u201d when you\u2019re elderly and need to be looked after.", "I mean, she just lost her home, her husband, and the future she planned for her family.  Plus you've made it clear you don't want to be near her, so I'd say she's pretty independent by default here.\n\nIn my opinion, western societies sometimes put too much emphasis on independence.  There's nothing wrong with tight family bonds.  Plus, if she's living with you but paying rent and on a lease, that's more independent than you paying for her apartment.", "That is ironic considering she had her daughter at 21. Her daughter got married at 21 but had her first kid at 22. You'd think she'd be more understanding as a former young mother.", "Maybe if you hadn't pushed her out so quickly she wouldn't be in this situation now.

Sometimes, we just need our moms. The fact she\u2019s emotionally intelligent and vulnerable enough with you to share that she just needs her mom tells me 2 things \n\n1) you raised her right. You\u2019re a good mom. She feels like she can rely on you. \n\n2) she really needs the help. She wouldn\u2019t ask if she didn\u2019t. \n\nPlease continue being a good mom. Clearly she trusts you and values your support. Letting her move in for a few months while she\u2019s going through something devastating is not \u201cmoving backwards\u201d, it\u2019s called life. She\u2019s already showing a huge amount of independence and maturity by being able to admit she\u2019s not okay and needs help emotionally. \n\nBe there for her. You\u2019re her mother.", "Ironically you are treating her not as a fellow adult and equal in need of support, but as a child that needs to be taught lessons.", "Life isn\u2019t linear.

You are hurting your child.", "I hope to never have this energy with my daughter. Even if she wasn't going through something this traumatic i'm ALWAYS going to be there for her. She is crying out for help from you and you are denying her. You are heartless.", "YTA. You are not a good mom. Maybe if she had more love and support at 19 she wouldn\u2019t have felt the need to find someone so soon and could have picked better.", "Honestly, to me it sounds like you're just wanting to punish your daughter because she didn't do exactly what you wanted when she moved out and into an apartment with her soon-to-be ex husband.  She didn't do what your sons did and go to college to fulfill what you perceive as greater goals in life. It seems like you want to teach her a lesson.\n\nThis is not teaching her any lesson other than the fact that love is conditional.  I agree with others that your offer to pay rent is generous but that's not what she's asking for.  She's asking for a few months to live with you and gather herself instead of moving from a full house to an empty house at least every other week.  I don't think that's too much to ask.  \n\nLife isn't always, or even usually, a straight arrow.  It sometimes arcs, it sometimes reverses.  Your daughter is still young with a full plate.  She wants some emotional support, not simply transactional.  However, if you're going to show as little compassion to her if you let her move in as you show here, I would explain that you're unable to provide such support to her and help her find alternate arrangements.  This version of Mom isn't a great one for her to be around right now (if ever).", "not even sure why you are asking this on the internet.  your own children who know you best have already called you a heartless AH", "This is precisely how people get put in the retirement homes featured on Dateline.", "What exactly do you define as independent? Because independent doesn't mean not asking for help when needed. You are just acting cold and it will bite you in the ass, you are damaging your relationship with your daughter permanently", "This is so transactional and heartless. I was raised to be independent and moved out at 17. I\u2019ve only asked my mom for help like two or three times in my adult life. Once when I left a bad relationship and needed a place to stay. She never questioned it or pushed me out. I stayed with her for like 2 or 3 months while I searched for a place of my own. The fact that you\u2019re more concerned about her being independent than you are about the actual extra people in your house makes you the biggest asshole. Your daughter has kids and is experiencing something traumatic. Instead of being an emotional support to her, you\u2019re pushing her aside in the name of independence. Searching for a new place is stressful and takes time, even in the best circumstances. She\u2019s shouldering the emotional burden of being left and caring for her kids, and also having to move. That\u2019s a lot. Have a heart and let her stay while she regroups and gets back on her feet.\n\nEdit to add: don\u2019t be surprised when she goes low or no contact with you and you don\u2019t have a relationship with your grandchildren. Even if you do let her move in, she won\u2019t forget your initial response. She will always remember that not only was her husband\u2019s love conditional and easy to lose, her mother\u2019s love was and is too.", "Can't believe i had to scroll so far to see this.  I don't live near our families.  But when I was pregnant & need emotional support, they were a phone call away.", "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills in this thread the way people are acting like moving 3 people into a parents house for \"emotional support\" when you can easily afford an apartment is reasonable. Her husband's an asshole who cheated on her, and that sucks, but it's not like her entire livelihood has been demolished, considering she says she can afford an apartment. This isn't \"I've been kept barefoot and full-bellied for 10 years and now my husband died with no life insurance.\"\n\nLike... Visit daily?", "YTA  just because your daughter is 24 and HAS been independent since she was 19 doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t need emotional support during difficult times in her life. Clearly, you\u2019ve never needed anyone, and hopefully it stays that way. Because you have shut your daughter out and you\u2019ve shown all your children you are, in fact, heartless, you are YTA, and you\u2019ve likely permanently damaged your relationship with your daughter and therefore your grandchildren. But at least you taught her that you can never count on anyone, and she will never be able to trust her family, but, hey! At least she\u2019s living alone, right?", "Accepting your judgment? Your comments have shown the opposite.", "YTA. I hope your daughter tells you to be independent when she ships you off to a nursing home in the future. \n\nImagine being betrayed and abandoned by the man who vowed to be there for you 6 months postpartum, and then having your own mom emotionally abandon you. \n\nThis is the beginning of the end of your relationship with your daughter, she\u2019ll never ask you for anything again. \n\nDisgusting tbh", "Like it mattered. You are still the asshole", "Your daughter is only 24. She\u2019s still just figuring out her adult life. And what you are teaching her is that you are not part of her support system.

Daughter picked the husband, not Mom. Daughter needs to process the divorce, not necessarily alone, but not being emotionally dependent on Mom 24/7. That will also take a toll on Mom. Mom should be there for her daughter, but also have boundaries. Daughter needs a therapist and a good divorce attorney.

So the 26 lives at home too \"anxious\" to work and the 24 year old is in year 5 of college taking one class.\n\nSuch interesting ends of the spectrum.", "You're totally right, I just use a lot of hyperbole.

Everyone has favorites but you see this pattern too often.", "You may be right and it's insane narcissism letting perceived others' opinions affect her relationship with her daughter.  I could see it just being plain indifference to the daughter as well, though. I think she loves her boys and just doesn't really care much for her daughter.
