Her finances are good and she can afford her own place, but her mental and emotional well-being have been destroyed.

Remember that she must be heartbroken, her \"husband\" cheated on her after at least 5 years (since, remember, she left to live with her then boyfriend). She really need emotional support right now. It's really not about the money, it's about the needs to be with you.\n\nFurthermore, I've read the comments. You said that your daughter coming back to you would be \"a step backwards\" in her independancy. How? She wanted support after being cheated on by her husband of 3 years/boyfriend of at least 5 years. That's a perfectly fine reaction from your daughter here. You are being too harsh, and you showed to her as a heartless mom here.\n\nAgain, YTA.", "\"She started to cry and said she just needs her mom right now.\"\n\nAnd you hold her at arm's length and just say \"you'll be fine\"?

Be that mom.", ">They called me heartless.\n\n\nI mean, your daughter came to you for support and you asked about her credit score.

You're already offering to subsidize a place for them.\n\nNAH.", "YTA. Shady Pines, Ma. Shady Pines!", "YTA.

It's not rocket science!", "YTA - Your daughter is going through something terrible\u2026the effects of which will be lasting. She has a hard road ahead of her. Seems like you would want to help her. This really seems cold-hearted.", "YTA. I'm very different from a lot of Reddit users. I have absolutely no problem with my kids living with me as long as they want to. My husband feels the same. Right now, they're all in  university and when they graduate, they'll all have the opportunity to get good-paying jobs. When that happens, they'll pay room and board and save money to move out. Let's face it, with houses and rent being so far out of reach for most young adults, they'll likely be with us for a number of years and that's fine. I not only love them, I like them. They're great company and great conversationalists. My parents were the same with my siblings and me. None of us had problems living on our own independently, and if any of us had a financial crisis and wanted to move back in with our parents, they were fine with it. It always felt so good to know they were always there for us right up till they passed away in their 90s. So, if one of my kids was in crisis, emotionally or physically, I'd have them back with us in a heartbeat if that's what they needed, including their children, whom I'd  love as my own. Again, this is how my parents were with their grandchildren. Not possessive, not interfering, just unconditional love. So maybe it depends on how you're raised, but I think OP is a rather heartless mom.", "You seem to have bought into the ideal that every person is an island and should go it alone. You should reassess that. The only reason humans are successful as a species is cooperation. Most other cultures incorporate that. America just has a bizarre obsession with denying it.

You can still support your daughter without having to live with her and her two kids 24/7.  As much as she claims she doesn't want free childcare, there's absolutely no way that you won't end up looking after those kids at least some of the time.  And being around a grieving woman with no opportunity for escape sounds exhausting. \n\nYou can support her from a comfortable distance.", "NAH. I understand where everyone here is coming from. But having two kids two and under in the house every other week is a huge ask. I do like the idea of a temporary situation. Give her a month or two and then help her find an apartment. She clearly needs the support and from what you\u2019ve said, she\u2019s never actually been independent so she\u2019s likely going to need some help. Additionally, she likely needs to build her credit history a little bit. Living with you for too long might actually hurt her future.", "YTA and a massive one. My daughter moved back home when her ex husband was cheating on her. All she wanted was her mom in her corner giving her the damm emotional support she needed.\nWasn't about rent or having the room for her. I never viewed her comming home as something backwards. It was something she needed to get her bearings in her new normal. And she had 3 kids and not once did she ask me to babysit.", "YTA but barely. This one is really tough.\n\nYou are willing to provide support which is great but you're avoiding what she's actually asking for. She's made it clear that it's not about money but emotional support which she feels needs physical closeness to get.\n\nIt's okay if you don't want her to move in to provide this emotional support but by offering money, you're sidestepping the actual request. Maybe a promise that you'll be available or an offer to help her find therapy or other support will be received better.\n\nI do think you put too much emphasis on her needing independence. She just found out that the person she thought was her lifetime partner is a cheating asshole.

It's reasonable that she needs some time to adjust to not having that team member.", "First, her name is not on the lease, but they are married with children. Ask advice from a lawyer before simply moving out. And if simply moving out, how much is hubby going to pay for the rent for his 'still' wife and their children?\n\nSecond. Let's face it.

I was in the near exact same situation as her, same age, with kids the same age, when I got divorced.

She has two children (2 & 6 months). Recently, her husband revealed he\u2019s been cheating on her and is leaving her for another woman. They rent a house but due to my daughter having no credit at the time of moving in, only his name is on the lease. He is giving her 30 days to move out. \n\nMallory is understandably distraught. I\u2019ve been doing all I can to comfort her. She asked if she could move in with me, explaining she\u2019d have the kids every other week. She assured me she isn\u2019t looking for childcare. Both kids are in daycare. She offered to pay rent and chip in on groceries. \n\nNow, I have always raised my kids to be independent. I didn\u2019t kick them out at 18, but I did encourage them to start doing things on their own. Mallory moved out at 19 (moving in with her soon to be ex), my sons are in college and plan to move out after graduating from college (they\u2019re both freshmen at the same university). \n\nI asked Mallory how her credit score was. She said she could reasonably rent. I offered to pay first month, last month and a deposit, along with 6 months rent. She said it\u2019s not about the money. She\u2019s not wealthy by any means but she does well for herself and her husband is already agreeing to give her money weekly, even before they go to court. She just wants emotional support.\n\nI told her I could do that with her living in her own place. She started to cry and said she just needs her mom right now. I told her she was going to be okay.\n\nMy sons are pissed with me. They pointed out I have plenty of room, that Mallory has offered to pay rent. She\u2019s also not the type to shrug off responsibility of the kids and the toddler is well behaved. To me, that doesn\u2019t matter. They called me heartless.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, I think your delivery was off for immediately asking about credit score and moving in (it felt like you were focusing on how the situation would impact you and not the impact its having onbthe daughter), I think you should apologize for that. For emotional support, I think its fair to tell the daughter to move close so you can visit and face time enough. I also think you should suggest your daughter go to therapy.

Having a place where they can settle down quickly seems like a good thing. It provides stability. \n\nI just can\u2019t be on board that this is asshole territory though.

Your daughter has kids and is experiencing something traumatic. Instead of being an emotional support to her, you\u2019re pushing her aside in the name of independence. Searching for a new place is stressful and takes time, even in the best circumstances. She\u2019s shouldering the emotional burden of being left and caring for her kids, and also having to move.

Unless I missed it, you\u2019re not even honest enough with yourself or your daughter to acknowledge that your real reason for not helping in this way is *you just don\u2019t want to.* It\u2019s one thing to set a boundary, but at least have the decency to admit that it\u2019s *your* boundary for *your* wishes, not somehow protecting her independence or otherwise helping her.\n\n3. She made a request, you offered an alternative, she clarified that the need for which she made the request would not be met by the proposed alternative. The correct and respectful response to that isn\u2019t \u201cMy alternative DOES meet your need!\u201d She knows what will make her feel you\u2019re there for her, she knows that you helping her get an apartment isn\u2019t going to have that effect. She\u2019s going to be alone in that apartment to feel her emotions in isolation \u2014 especially the weeks she doesn\u2019t have the kids \u2014 and even just knowing there\u2019s someone who loves you in the next room can be the anchor a person needs during a time like that. You know that she doesn\u2019t need help with rent, so pushing that solution is an effort to make *yourself* feel better. You don\u2019t want to admit that you\u2019re just declining to help, so instead you\u2019re proposing something that you find comfortable and pretending it\u2019s for her benefit.\n\n4. Your daughter is currently stuck with a hard deadline on when to move out, presumably living with the man who betrayed her until she finds somewhere to go. Moving in with you wouldn\u2019t just give her a little more time; it would also allow her to approach her apartment hunt from a place she feels safe. Her life just fell apart around her, she needs to find a place that will feel stable \u2014 someplace she could stay for a long time, for a price she can afford if things don\u2019t go according to plan (eg, if her ex becomes less amicable about the divorce and hires expensive lawyers to try to screw her over). Finding that new \u201chome,\u201d that new place to feel safe, will be so much harder if she\u2019s rushing to meet a deadline or to get away from her ex, and the new place will hold more painful memories if she goes straight from her divorce to the new place; even a few weeks with you could help her reset before moving into the new place to at least reduce the negative associations.\n\n5. This is a smaller factor, because I know there are varying views on this point, but I don\u2019t think the obligation to be there for your kids ends when they hit 18, nor does it end when they successfully live independently. Unless you and your daughter had some sort of falling out where the mother\u2014daughter relationship was damaged, I think you have some moral obligation to try to help her if you can, in the way that *she* needs. I (kind of) understand not wanting her to move in indefinitely, but to not even offer that she come stay with you for a specific time span to recover a little before being on her own??? From my perspective at least, you treated her like a random adult instead of like your daughter, and I hope that means that you\u2019re not expecting any special treatment (eg, support in old age) from her based on your being her mother.\n\n6. The smallest factor: she has a date by which she needs to leave what she thought was her home. Letting her stay with you even for a limited time could make a world of difference in how she\u2019s able to set herself up for her future. Where I am, this is by far the most expensive time of year to be signing a lease on an apartment; I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true where you are, but if it is, your 6 months of help won\u2019t be much help to her later when she\u2019s stuck paying higher rent. In my experience and where I am (again, may not apply), signing a lease at this time of year doesn\u2019t just mess you up for the span of that lease; it means your lease ends during the same time of year, when costs are still double or triple what they would usually be, and the cost of breaking a lease or signing a six-month lease to break that cycle can be considerable. If the rental market is similar where you are (which, again, it may not be), then your six months of help will be canceled out pretty quickly *and* she may need to go through another move (read: more instability when her life already feels like it\u2019s falling apart) in future to move if her choice now becomes being homeless, or signing a lease somewhere that won\u2019t work in the long-term.\n\n You severed  \u2014 or at least damaged \u2014 the mother\u2014daughter relationship by making no effort to meet her actual needs during the hardest time in her life, and to add insult to injury you pretended it was based on some inherent negative value to an adult needing her mother, and made an offer that wouldn\u2019t actually meet the communicated need so you could feel like you still did your job.", "NTA.

Moreso for the parenting when they're young, and hopefully you raised them well so the latter can come about when they're older (you generally, not you specifically lol), but even with her nearly 18, i still have to switch hats between parent, and support system letting her make her own decisions. I certainly wasn't the perfect parent, but I think I did OK. \n\nBut if my daughter's husband cheated with two kids there? F- off to the spouse, come live with me to my daughter so we can get you on your feet and figure out the next move more comfortably than trying to do it all alone. That's what family is for...", "Right? This is one of those times when you push aside your own needs as a parent and be there for your kid. \n\nShe just had her whole life flipped upside down and is now about to be a divorced single mother before she's even in her mid twenties. Time for parents to bite the bullet for a few months while she gets reoriented with her new life. \n\nYou can still have your own firm boundaries while living together (ex. Daughter has already arranged childcare so that will not be OPs burden). Is OP is the wrong? I guess no technically not. But the daughter is crying out for *her*. Not for money. To turn the other way is being heartless- sorry. If you're okay with being heartless so that you don't have to risk you own comfort, and it comes at the expense of your relationship with your daughter, then that's your prerogative. But guess what - it means YTA!", "You're welcome! \ud83d\ude0a \n\nBe well.", "I mean I wouldn't expect my dad to know how to make stew. Or anything.", "This made my cry. I\u2019m so sorry for your lost. She sounds like an amazing person", "I'm so sorry for the loss of your mother.", "... if it weren't the middle of the night, I'd be calling my parents right now. So many hugs for you.", "I see it the same way! I\u2019m glad you were able to reach so many wonderful milestones even with the challenges of being a young parent.  I was in a relationship with my now husband when I was 21 but I had health issues to overcome before I could become a mom.  It has been fun and kept me feeling young being able to go through all of the school years in my 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s. It was a shock though, to realize one of my dear friends among the school moms was the same age as my oldest niece!  But that same niece has a daughter working on her master\u2019s degree so I shouldn\u2019t have been too surprised!", "I am so sorry for your loss. It's just so hard. {{hugs}}", "This will likely damage their relationship beyond repair, and I wouldn\u2019t blame the daughter one damn bit. \n\nShe agreed to sign a lease for a short period of time so that there wasn\u2019t a risk of it dragging on too long.  The kids are in daycare so she\u2019s not asking for babysitting. She just wants to be home for a little bit, and that\u2019s extremely understandable. \n\nGoing home to an empty apartment for you and your kids is awful. Even if she doesn\u2019t ask her mom for day to day help with the kids, just being there will make her feel less lonely, less abandoned. \n\nShe\u2019s going through a divorce after finding out her husband was cheating on her. That\u2019s hard. Going through it while also raising two babies on your own? Fucking devastating. Do people do it? Sure, but they often struggle a lot. Feeling alone in the world is a really hard thing, and OP has the ability to help her daughter through that. \n\nShe\u2019s not asking to move in permanently. She\u2019s not dumping the kids on her. She just wants to be at home while she catches her breath. \n\nOP can say no, but damn. It definitely makes her the AH. \n\nAnd down the road when OP breaks a hip and needs to stay with someone, she shouldn\u2019t be surprised when her daughter books her a room at a shitty nursing home, bc that\u2019s how you treat family in their family.", "Daycare is during the work day usually. What about nights and weekends? How will this many people impact the sleeping arrangements? There's technically no evidence that the kids won't disturb OP's sleep or make messes, but we have met children and know better. People sign leases and take advantage every day. She does want a soft place to land and OP is offering her a very nice one, it just isn't in OP's home. You can fault OP for not doing exactly what her daughter wants, but she is very much willing to be there for her child both financially and emotionally. She just isn't willing to have 3 long term roommates.", "NTA. You can visit her in her own apartment and provide emotional support through phone calls and visits like any other adult. 3 humans moving in, with 2 being small children is a huge lifestyle change, especially when they have other options. No one should assume that needs to happen if you don\u2019t want it to.\n\nYour daughter is hurting, but she needs the opportunity to know that she can live on her own, and that you will still be there to help her and love her. It sounds like she\u2019s never lived on her own so she\u2019s probably especially afraid in this emotional time, especially with the kids. But if she jumps straight to living with you, then she may jump to another unhealthy relationship next. She needs a chance to stand on her own two feet, and it will be uncomfortable for her. \n\nAll these people are acting like you can\u2019t properly love someone and live in separate spaces, but you most certainly can.", "Seriously?! OP is NTA. \n\nShe offered substantial money to allow her daughter to get her own place, she offered emotional support during this as well. She made sure her daughter could afford it as well (and she can). She did not boot her kid out early daughter left at 19. Sounds to me that daughter has been with someone her whole life. Going from moms house to the exes house. It\u2019s not going to hurt her to live alone for a bit. It might do her good. Especially with OP offering emotional and financial support.", "NTA. You don't have to be under the same roof to provide your daughter with emotional support. This is a difficult time but she's an adult and needs to stand tall and weather this storm.", "NTA you gave reasonable help financially if she wanted it. And she doesn't need to live with you to get help emotionally from you. \n\nI know this will be disagreed with but she is an adult, granted going through something hurtful and stressful, and i truly do feel sorry that it has happened to her and the children. But having a place for her and her kids is more beneficial for her and its not like the mum won't be there for her emotionally she said she would. The mum could easily be over there at the house with her or vice versa or even constant phone calls. You really don't need to move home just to recieve emotional support. That can be done from anywhere.", "OP I doubt you will read this, but here are my two cents. Your daughter has seemingly never lived alone. It seems you have a rather large household with yourself, two boys, and assuming a significant other. Your daughter has always lived in a house with others and possibly never alone. At 24 years old, living alone is hard and lonely. Yes she has her two kids but the off weeks will be miserable to be alone in an empty house for the first time. Your daughter needs her mom and siblings. I have a very large family, larger than yours (I\u2019m assuming). I lived alone for a few years around your daughters age, after a few bad roommates and a lifetime of siblings, it was 100% my choice to live alone. I loved it in the best moments but it was very quiet and very lonely sometimes. I think from an emotional standpoint I wouldn\u2019t want my daughter being alone for the first time under these circumstances. Please, reconsider your stance and set a time limit if that makes you feel better.", "I can\u2019t even comprehend this. I have grown adult children. I\u2019ve had two sons have a hard time that they needed to move back in. Anywhere I live, I feel is my children\u2019s home just as much as it is mine regardless of the age. They\u2019ve all been independent and still occasionally need help. You must be soulless and have zero empathy to not understand a mom is a mom is a mom. The age of your children doesn\u2019t ever change that! YTA a million times over!!!", "Agreed! It was the same with my husband's and my parents. My kids are the same ages as the grandkids in this post. My husband and I HOPE we raise our kids to flap their wings and fly solo someday, but to know they are always welcome and wanted to come back home if they need a spot to land. Our job as parents does not end when they turn 18. This post makes me incredibly sad.", "YES. It's not about the money. This is a very young woman who needs her mother and her mother is letting her down.   \n\n\nOP is very much TA", "I kind of get that part from OP. But I had my kiddo at 19. They are just now going away to college. However at ANY time, I will be here for my kiddo if they need to move back in. If they have a baby?? I will be annoyingly present. If they had a falling out like OP\u2019s daughter? I couldn\u2019t imagine anything other than them moving in with me until they wanted to spread their wings again. \n\nBeing a young Mom doesn\u2019t excuse the heartlessness. Age doesn\u2019t explain this other than it sounds like she wishes she didn\u2019t have children at all, but accepted them like a prison sentence.", "Same. And my parents are assholes.", "She can still get \"a little help\" and \"support\" without living with her though  \n\n\nOut of the hundreds of comments claiming YTA not ONE of them has explained why living together is 100% required to provide help or support.", "But do you have to grieve under the same roof?

So do you expect OP to then pick up her life and move to where the daughter is?", "We don\u2019t know more context about the daughters mental health. With children that young she could have post partum depression and on top of that her divorce with her husband who has been cheating is too much for her. Not only is she going through a divorce but her husband cheated on her and is abandoning the kids for another woman. She needs someone else to be an adult in the house and help her cope with her loss and situation. Even if the mother comes over to the daughters new place is not the same. Sometimes people need someone to remind them to eat or to shower because they are on auto pilot trying to take care of other things but don\u2019t have the energy to take care of themselves. With two toddlers, a place to herself, and the other stressors of life it can be easy to give in to depression and other mental health issues.", "That\u2019s true, and I agree it isn\u2019t good but doesn\u2019t qualify for asshole level shit.

My condolences to you.", "\"She just wants emotional support.\" \"To me, that doesn't matter.\"\n\nWow, you are beyond-asshole level on this one.

How the hell are you not the asshole, here? And if you think you're not, who do you think is?\n\nIn a way, you're doing your daughter a favor by disabusing her of what is clearly a misconception on her part, i.e., that her mother cares about her.

Speaking from personal experience, like your daughter\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m currently living in my dad\u2019s one bedroom apartment, where my little brother also stays occasionally (dad has a pullout bed in his room). My space is literally a bed with a curtain separating me from the rest of the living room.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had a somewhat toxic relationship and we just broke up for the 4th time and possibly the last. He did not cheat on me, but there\u2019s been many times where he gets into these states where he doesn\u2019t know what to feel and tells me he doesn\u2019t think he loves me.\n\nIf my dad can welcome me into his TINY APARTMENT and make accommodations for me, you can do so when you have the space. I admit I rushed into this relationship; it\u2019s my first ever serious one. I never got the time after high school to get used to being alone and I think that\u2019s the case for your daughter as well. \n\nMy dad has always told me that no matter how old I am and what\u2019s going on in his life he will ALWAYS have space for me. Your daughter\u2019s life was just uprooted and turned upside down. I understand you probably don\u2019t want 3 more people in your house, 2 being very young children and at least you gave her that option of having her own place, but understand that your daughter feels INCREDIBLY alone. Betrayed. From her ex and now you. Your response to her when she was telling you she really needs you right now was very, very cold. \n\nWhen my dad was in a bad car accident, I didn\u2019t call anyone except my mom. Mother\u2019s love is like no other. It makes you feel safe and calm. I called my mom while she was at work and she rushed to my side, spent time with me. Your daughter needs this. She wants to feel safe, secure. Surrounded by not only you, but her brothers as well. Her family. \n\nPlease rethink your stance on this. She needs you. She needs this right now.", "I'm 37 and I've also just gone through divorce because my husband cheated on me . \n\nMy mum WANTS me to move home! I told her I was considering it short term and she was so excited to potentially have me back. She says she just wants to look after me. She says to me pretty much every phone call she wants me home.\n\nTHAT'S how a mum should act. OP, YTA.", "Soft YTA from me. As someone in this almost exact situation where i could have been homeless if not for my parents living in my city, i not only needed somewhere to live but i needed my home, my family. My husband was a abusive and when I finally got the courage to ask him to leave and for a divorce, the only place i wanted to be was where i felt safe. I understand that you're doing what you can to help her out financially and that's amazing, but what about emotionally? She needs her mom.", "NTA. You are helping your daughter and I am worried that if she moves in with you, she will take advantage of you for free daycare, maid service and as a personal ATM. You aren't telling you that you won't be there to help but you are setting a resonable expectation that she needs to be an adult. I would also recommend getting her into therapy. I was 24 with 3 children when my ex-husband cheated on me and we got divorced. It was absolutely devastating and if I had moved back in with my mother I don't think I would have done as well. My concern is that by moving back in with you, your daughter will be more childlike and less adult because Mommy is there to take care of everything. Be there for her, answer her calls and give her time to herself, but she needs to be an adult.", "YTA. she was already abandoned by her husband, now her mother is abandoning her.", "YTA. Your daughter wants her MOTHER to COMFORT her not someone to pay for an apartment. Seriously it\u2019s a surprise she\u2019s asking at all when it seems like you were the \u201chug with your eyes\u201d type mother", "Wow, YTA. WOW YTA YTA YTA", "YTA  your daughter is experiencing rejection from both her mother and her husband. How hurt she must be.", "OP, my nan was the same with her children. And it didn\u2019t end well. Please, don\u2019t do the same thing. \n\nMy mum had no where to escape a very violent husband (my father), had no money because he kept it, and wasn\u2019t allowed back home. Although violence isn\u2019t the issue here, my nans actions greatly impacted my mums life (and by extension, her five children), and damaged their relationship. They were never close. \n\nMy aunt was much like your daughter. She lost her place of residence, wasn\u2019t allowed back home. My mum found her crying on the front steps of nans house with her infant son in her arms and nowhere to go. All of my aunts and uncles have trauma, it affected them in different ways. \n\nDon\u2019t do that. Do better.", "YTA, It's not just about the money, it's about having someone to have her support as well, it's going to be a hard time for her. She not only has to face with the end of her marriage, she's also dealing with being cheated on which is going to potentially cause a lot of of trust issues.  There's a lot to potentially prepare for, what's going to happen when her ex drops the ball and does something fucked up? I've read way too many posts from women where the ex husband just had to pick pussy over their kids. She's gonna need someone to lean on and she needs her squad to back her up.", "I'm not gonna call you the A-hole, because you are offering to help her. But it sounds like she just wanted the comfort of her mother after finding out the father of her children has been cheating on her. I think she'll get over this, but I'm willing to bet you're gonna remember it when you're alone in a nursing home,  wondering why your kids don't visit, but the lights always stay on, and your dinner always arrives at 4.", "yep this. I cannot imagine the pain of giving someone 2 children, and finding out not only was this person cheating on you, they were cheating on you likely while you were pregnant if not the whole marriage, AND they are leaving you for this other party. Then the icing on the shit cake is your mother doesn't want you to live with her but is fine throwing money at the problem.\n\nAlso for the record: don't take this Bozo's word he's happy to pay or split custody 50/50 without going to court. go to court!! don't trust this loser!! major vibes for the kinda guy that is likely to just fully disappear when he gets to making his second \"true\" family.", "Can't believe I had to scroll this far to find a NTA. I thought she was OBVIOUSLY NTA and was shocked when I got to the comments section. I'm not even a parent myself, but I think it's fine for parents to establish boundaries and vice versa. I think the woman is a saint to offer that much financial support for the apartment. I wish I had a mother like this!", "I agree", "Mallory and the kids would barely be at home either. Mallory works, and the kids will only be there every other week. They are in daycare during the day, and they'll probably be in bed by 6-7pm.\n\nRegardless, OP says it's not about the kids as Mallory will be responsible for them and they are well behaved. She just wants Mallory to be \"independent\". I wonder how hard OP pushed Mallory to be \"independent\" when she was 19, and whether she would be in this situation now if she'd been given a little more time to find her feet. Moving out at 19 to live with a boyfriend is not usually a good idea, especially if it's an unequal relationship where he is the only one with credit and she is dependent on him for housing. She's pretty young for two kids and a divorce, I wonder if she rushed this relationship because she felt under pressure to get out of mom's house in the first place.", "The daughter asked to stay there for three months. OP seems to lack empathy and understanding that not being alone in a house is what her daughter needs.", "Coming home to an empty, dark apartment when you\u2019re parenting two young children and your whole life just fell apart is a situation in which simply just knowing someone else is home, too, is the difference between keeping it all together, or falling off the deep end.\n\nI get the feeling that the very *reason* Mallory **needs** her mom so much right now, is because her mom *never has* provided that emotional safety in the first place. \n\nOP is free to make whatever choices she needs to, with no explanation to anyone at all, but this isn\u2019t about whether or not OP is an AH for *making* any particular decision. It\u2019s about **why** OP is making that decision, and it\u2019s about a child needing something\u2014 in this case the very simple act of nurturing\u2014 that their parent won\u2019t, or cant, offer them. And if I read/re-read correctly, OP hasn\u2019t even offered a reason, other than \u201cI want her to be independent.\u201d What is OP afraid of, when by all accounts in *her own comments* she\u2019s said that Mallory wouldn\u2019t abuse the situation if she were to briefly move home on her way to that very same independence OP claims to want for her!? \n\nLike, is OP coming from a place of \u201cI had to suck it up as a young single mom, so Mallory should have to, too!\u201d?? Does she not remember how much she herself could have used a little grace/kindness when she was in a similar (but even **less** traumatic) situation?? Tough love my arse. \n\nOP, YTA, for making your child pay the price of *your* not being brave enough to be vulnerable, so as a result not being able to accept vulnerability in anyone else.", ">doesn't have to be forever, put a timeline on it. I would say 6 months, 3 isn't enough.\n\nOne of OP's comments:\n\n>She originally asked to stay through the summer. When I said no, she revised it to 3 months or what I thought was fair. She offered to sign a lease and make it official to prove their was an end date.\nI think she needs to learn to live independently. Going from me to husband then back to me is not a good idea.", "SAME! And honestly just looking at OP and daughters\u2019 personalities, living under the same roof would be a disaster and probably make the relationship even worse. Daughter is justifiably in a vulnerable place. OP doesn\u2019t have the emotional/mental capacity/desire to accommodate. Those are not people who should be living together.", "Agreed. I think mom is setting perfectly healthy boundaries for herself. OP had the daughter around 21. She spent the last ~24 years raising her kids, and it seems like she did a pretty good job (sons are in college, daughter seems good with finances, doesn\u2019t need extra help with the kids). But now daughter wants to move back in?? Yes, you are responsible for your child, but not to the point where you are sacrificing your own life. As another commenter said, it\u2019s incredibly naive to think that daughter and two young kids will move in and mom WON\u2019T have to have childcare/other caregiver duties.\n\nEven if mom relents and lets daughter move back in, that\u2019s a recipe for disaster. If anything, that might strain the relationship even more. Even without the pain of divorce/betrayal, it\u2019s not easy to live with other adults who aren\u2019t your partner. Mom seems like she has a more pragmatic, detached personality, whereas daughter seems much more emotional (she NEEDS her mom and anything short of sharing living quarters isn\u2019t good enough for her). In what world would them living under the same roof be a good idea?", "I don\u2019t wanna kick this poor girl while she\u2019s down, but honestly these choices aren\u2019t the best as someone just one year older than her and up till recently had a pretty good job reading this gave me a panic attack. Her mom really pushed her to make these choices by wanting her to be \u201cindependent\u201d I feel like. I think OP needs to realize the effect that essentially pushing out her daughter would have one her. Like it would have been great if everything worked out but the cards were stacked against the daughter to begin with due to her moms mentality", "Sick.", "YUP. I think it would actually be disastrous and make the relationship even worse, just based on the personalities of OP and the daughter.", "Ugh, I\u2019m so sorry \n\nAt least he finally learned, even if it took that", "My mom did that when I was in the hospital potentially dying of pre-eclampsia.  We are NC now and she will tell everyone she doesn\u2019t know why.", "Incredible how they never seem to know why isn\u2019t it."]}
