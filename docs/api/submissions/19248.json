My friend Cindy set me up with a coworker of hers that I guess had seen me a couple times I went to see her at work. He was cute, has a good smile and seemed like an even better personality, so when she asked if I'd go on a date with him I said yes.\n\nHe took me to a nice restaurant and it starts out really great, we share interests and hobbies, both like history, etc. I thought I might actually had the right guy fall into my lap until a mom and her three kids walked in. He and I are black, the mom and her kids are white. My mom and dad are white (I'm adopted, this comes into play). The kids are SO well behaved. No screaming, no fussing or horseplaying, and the oldest kid doesn't look older than 10. Basically, NO reason to say anything about this mom and kids - I thought.\n\nThey sit in the other booth, and he IMMEDIATELY starts saying things like, \" Ugh, kids...\" \"Did she really have to bring crotch monsters?\" I ignored him because this was all muttered so I didn't engage, even though I thought he was ridiculous. He amps up, and after a couple more gripes he looks me right in my eyes, grins, and says, \"White people, right? Can't even let us eat in peace.\"\n\nI was shocked, didn't say anything, so he nudges him, like how people do for an answer. I just get up, dust my lap, and calmly say \"My parents are white, and I've been more mocked and hurt by black people because I have white parents. Go f*ck yourself.\" I did not yell, I did not cause a scene, just said that, threw my money for my order on the table and left. I think he was saying something but I don't know, I was too upset.\n\nI later got a message from my friend that night, saying he contacted her and that I'm 'interally racist ' and that the mom and kids heard what I said, complained to a waitress, and he was kicked out for 'distruptive behavior '. She told me I was an AH and should 'know what he's gone through because of our skin ' and that I 'cant hold it against him because he didn't know about my parents.  My parents are hurt that once again I have to deal with shit like this, and have implied I could have waited to leave before saying anything.\n\nUPDATE: Cindy and I are no longer friends after claiming my parents are racist by default. She has also said that no one ever did anything to me in school because of my parents' race which is untrue. I at this point have also gotten some DMs about me needing to stop existing (not exactly the words...) And that I AM internally racist.
