So much so that my husband has told me we will never tell his Mom about it, but I\u2019m so upset I just need to talk about it because I can\u2019t believe it was said.\n\nAnyway, am I the asshole for denying my Dad his support system for a not loss-related personal event after she essentially just invited herself?", "created_utc": 1672218038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx4xre/aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepmother_to_be_at_the/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it is YOUR day, not stepmonster's. \n\nCongrats and I hope that you have a lovely, peace filled day.", "It's not too much to ask and it's your life and your delivery so you get to do what you want. \n\nBut I'm a \"all or nothing\" solution that kind of problem so you should tell your father that if he needs support to meet his grandchild, then he's going to have to wait until you're ready for your stepmother to meet your child (if that ever happens seing as she behaves like a spoiled brat). Tell him that it was a choice for the GP to be there right after the birth and that you can choose to have the hospital staff to not let him anywhere near your room if he's not happy with your decision. \n\nYour stepmother is an issue but she's only an issue because your father doesn't respect your boundaries and rules. Your problem is with him.", "I get on well with my husbands kids, but there are some things that are strictly family only. I proof read and corrected my husband's daughter's Masters and Doctoral theses but didn't attend their graduation ceremonies - that's a time for Mum and Dad pride and boasting. Birth of grandchild ditto!", "You get to decide who is allowed in the birth of your child.  Childbirth is not a spectator sport- the people you include are there for YOUR support, not for their own needs.  NTA. Tell your father and step that they are no longer allowed, just your husband and your mother, and his mother. Tell all the nurses and docs about this as well, because you know your step will attempt to make it about her and try to barge in. Your nurses will follow your wants and keep them and anyone else out. Good luck with your baby- Congratulations!", "NTA\n\nWhen she says you only have one step parent I\u2019d suggest replying with \u201cthat\u2019s one too many.\u201d  I\u2019d be inclined to go so far as to tell your Dad that he will not be allowed access to his grandchild any time she is there and firmly put the onus on him to reign her in.  What she said was despicable.  If your Dad needs support (is he the one pushing, btw?!) and your MIL is on her PW due to her husband\u2019s sad passing then I suggest it\u2019d make sense for them to be there for each other.  Hopefully your Dad will also be respectful to your mum.  Congratulations on your imminent arrival, it\u2019s a steep learning curve but the most amazing and rewarding adventure!", "When I had a C section the only person allowed to be there was my husband.\nWhen did surgery become a spectator activity?\nNTA you don\u2019t need your step mom fighting with your mom while you\u2019re being opened up", "NTA. Your dad doesn\u2019t need a support system, you\u2019re the one giving birth, not your dad.", "Nta\n\n\nIf your father cannot stop her from insulting you then he is failing at supporting you. He either depends you or he stays home too.", "NTA.    Since when do visitors  get a support person ?  \n\nDon't let her come.   She sounds horrible", "Why tf does your Dad need a support system for your baby's birth. Think about that. He's not having a baby, you are.", "NTA \n\nI have no idea why they think your DAD needs a support system after you give birth. That is ludicrous. Your dad is an AH for allowing his wife to treat you like this and not defending you.", "NTA not sure why anyone except the dad is entitled to be there and even he is only entitled if you agree. Anyone else should feel very privileged. Having a baby is overwhelming and exhausting and having someone there who makes you feel that stressed is not going to be helpful. You get to do this your way because this is the birth of your baby", "NTA where are you at that the hospital is even allowing more than 2 visitors? Your Dad & stepmom can visit you at home after the baby is born. Inviting that many people to the hospital is irresponsible with rsv, flu & other rampant illnesses spiking.", "\ud83d\ude02 \u201cthat\u2019s one too many\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 classic\n\nShe did say other things to the effect of \u201cI\u2019ve always supported you and your Dad and never went against your Mom\u201d etc and I said \u201cplease!

It\u2019s infuriating that they can\u2019t see that.", "I\u2019m in Dallas TX. Part of our reasoning was that we don\u2019t even know how many people we can have because their current COVID visitor policy doesn\u2019t specify specifically for the Labor & Delivery ward. From what I understand though, is only having our parents is like the least number of people that others usually have. Which is crazy to me\n\nAnd honestly I\u2019d prefer visits at the hospital because it\u2019s just generally more sterile and safe.", "You didn't unintentionally expose him. Cause how can anyone be prepared or expect such a statement coming out of anyone's mouth?? It's an unfathomably heartless statement that anyone with even the smallest modicum of empathy would never even think.", "Maybe a little less calm and a little more snark is exactly what\u2019s needed.  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Taking the high road is often the right thing to do but sometimes you just need to bite back and put someone firmly back in line!  Bare your teeth, mammabear!!", "You certainly don\u2019t need a bunch of people around when recovering from surgery, especially when one doesn\u2019t play well with others", "Yes I suppose. I just feel like if I were stronger none of this would have happened at all", "I have before! Definitely have stood up for myself with her before but again, it always makes the conflict my fault even though she started it. The last time she started shit I provided my Dad with screenshot proof that she was wrong and I was right and he legitimately never said anything to me about it after that \ud83d\ude02 of course", "> they live halfway across the country\n\nThey are only invited when *specifically* invited by you. If they lay out money and make plans before that that's on them.", "> I\u2019m usually told it\u2019s my fault (by her and my Dad and his family \ud83d\ude44)\n\nYou need to go low- to no-contact with both of them. Its the only way.", "It's hard to grow out of this mindset. But it isn't your fault - they are adults who should be able to manage their feelings well on their own. And if they can't, even more reason to keep them away from you and your baby.", "See it as a learning experience. Cutting off toxic people, especially family, can be incredibly difficult and can take a lot of time. The only ones to blame for this are your stepmom and your dad allowing it.", "I\u2019m glad you put your foot down for the birth, but his behavior is clearly acceptable to you because you continue to allow it. You don\u2019t deserve to be yelled at , especially on Christmas, but you dad facilitated that happening and you just took it instead of hanging up in him for his horrid behavior. You deserve so much better but you are enabling your own abuse in hopes that he will change one day, and i hate to break it to you but he will always be on her side and he will continue to allow her mistreat you the way she does", "Yeah that\u2019s true. They just always expect the most so \ud83d\ude2b it seems like it\u2019s not even worth it at this point", "That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done with all of his family which started when I was 13 I think? Something like that. And I\u2019ve been made out to be this horrible person since then, but it\u2019s made life so much easier and happier! My grandfather even disowned me a few months before he died and I honestly don\u2019t feel bad about it because it was stupid (he said my behavior over the years, such as in this situation, were unacceptable \ud83d\ude02). I just have Daddy issues and I want my Dad in my life, so that part is hard. But I guess at this point it just might not be worth it.", "Thank you, I really appreciate the support", "Thank you for this perspective \u2764\ufe0f I really appreciate it", "they should *expect* a boot in the booty...", "I agree with previous poster. You don\u2019t have to feel bad when boundary stompers make plans and lose money on them because they didn\u2019t seek your approval to visit.\n\nI am like you...no visitors during or after birth for quite a while. I had to tell my own dad no to a visit but the reality is if you let them get away with this now, it won\u2019t ever stop and will now include your children...best to feel bad for a bit but stop it now.", "If there was ever a time to draw a line in the sand, the birth of your kid is it. Start doing things on your terms, and they can join in if they follow your rules. They're perfectly capable of making choices and changing thcir behaviour if they want in on your life.", "That\u2019s how I feel as well. Part of the problem is they always blame my decisions on other people. For example, I only didn\u2019t want to be around my Dad when I was younger because of my Mom. This is false, I told my Mom I wasn\u2019t comfortable around him and I didn\u2019t want to go to his house. Mind you that decision was made when I was like 10 I think? And I\u2019ve been telling them ever since then that that was my decision and him and his whole family just can\u2019t accept it. In this instance my stepmother immediately reacted with \u201cthis is because of her husband!\u201d mind you, we were on a video call and on speakerphone \ud83d\ude02 but anyway, she currently has this notion that my husband makes all of the decisions and I just let him and I have no control in my own house \ud83d\ude44 I\u2019ve specifically told her that is not the case and that I actually make more decisions than he does, but she just can\u2019t believe it because if that were true I wouldn\u2019t be making decisions regarding my Dad this way. Like I haven\u2019t been doing that since she showed up or something \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 I can ignore that that thought process towards me is insulting, but I can\u2019t ignore the ridiculousness that my entire family of blood relatives has never talked about any of this with me (unless blackout drunk) and they choose to believe this asinine bullshit \ud83d\ude02", "You deserve a stress-free pregnancy. Tell them no visits and no calls until you get back in touch with them. Then block them everywhere."]}
