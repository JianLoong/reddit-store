Her point was that she\u2019s my Dads support system and there was room for her to be there (we told her we\u2019re trying to limit people and only parents are allowed) but I don\u2019t think this is an acceptable thing to say for any reason ever. So much so that my husband has told me we will never tell his Mom about it, but I\u2019m so upset I just need to talk about it because I can\u2019t believe it was said.\n\nAnyway, am I the asshole for denying my Dad his support system for a not loss-related personal event after she essentially just invited herself?", "created_utc": 1672218038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx4xre/aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepmother_to_be_at_the/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not too much to ask. As the birthing mother and the post surgery patient, it is not even too much for you to DEMAND. \n\nJust because your uninvited step mommy cannot handle your dad possibly interacting with your actual mom, it does not mean that stepmom's drama is allowed to invade YOUR day. And it is YOUR day, not stepmonster's. \n\nCongrats and I hope that you have a lovely, peace filled day.", "It's not too much to ask and it's your life and your delivery so you get to do what you want. \n\nBut I'm a \"all or nothing\" solution that kind of problem so you should tell your father that if he needs support to meet his grandchild, then he's going to have to wait until you're ready for your stepmother to meet your child (if that ever happens seing as she behaves like a spoiled brat). Tell him that it was a choice for the GP to be there right after the birth and that you can choose to have the hospital staff to not let him anywhere near your room if he's not happy with your decision. \n\nYour stepmother is an issue but she's only an issue because your father doesn't respect your boundaries and rules. Your problem is with him.", "I get on well with my husbands kids, but there are some things that are strictly family only. I proof read and corrected my husband's daughter's Masters and Doctoral theses but didn't attend their graduation ceremonies - that's a time for Mum and Dad pride and boasting. Birth of grandchild ditto!"]}
