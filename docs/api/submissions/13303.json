Either one or both of you has not wanted to commit, and I think that was a good decision.      \n        \nSecond, you have given up everything, and he has given up nothing.

Sometimes it\u2019s raining, so we can\u2019t just let them run in the yard and both of us have to take them out on leashes.  One dog has a special food routine, so sometimes wife only has time to feed one dog before she leaves for work and I take care of the others.  We communicate with each other and it all gets done one way or another.\n\nThere\u2019s a million different scenarios that are perfectly reasonable - none of which are grounds for calling off a marriage.\n\nEDIT:  I\u2019d also be willing to bet that what OP perceives as fianc\u00e9 only doing \u201c20% of the work\u201d has more to do with differences in opinion about what a well-maintained household looks like than it does about fianc\u00e9 actually not pulling their weight.  For example - my wife thinks floor should be swept daily.  I\u2019m cool with letting it go for a week.  That can cause tension if it\u2019s not talked about.
