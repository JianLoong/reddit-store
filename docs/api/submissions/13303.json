I\u2019ve had endless conversations and now arguments about the fact that fianc\u00e9 is taking on about 20% max of the household responsibilities (dog, groceries, cleaning, cooking, planning for the wedding, etc.). I am stretched extremely thin and am generally a really anxious person, so having to take care of him and all his stuff is too much on top of a full time job and extra work. \n\nThis morning I needed fianc\u00e9 to wake up early to walk our dog before leaving for his job at 7:30am. I woke up at 6am to care for the dogs I\u2019m watching, and have to commute 6 hours round trip to the city today. When I called bc I could see he hadn\u2019t taken her (Ring) he said \u201cI don\u2019t need your attitude\u201d and still DID NOT take her for a walk!!! \n\nNow I have to either run and do it myself or find someone else to care for her. \n\nI\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end and am genuinely not sure where to turn.
