Rachel confirmed she was excited to be attending and confirmed again the day before that she was still coming to celebrate my 25th. \n\nThe celebration started at 7pm and almost everyone is here after an hour except Rachel, who said she was running late, no worries. Around 9 when we are about to cut the cake, she shows up at the door, I hug her and give her a suprise birthday gift for her (her birthday was a week prior and she went out of town) and say how excited I was she made it. I was a bit stunned since she was in high heels, club outfit, full makeup on.\n\nShe hands me a bouquet of flowers, says happy birthday, and then says she won\u2019t be actually joining since there\u2019s an event at the club a few blocks down she wanted to check out. Also her ex was in town and she said she wanted to club with him. Everyone inside (we all know each other one way or another) was kinda thrown off by this, as she didn\u2019t even step in to say hi to anyone else and left after the brief exchange.\n\nI brushed it off in the moment but was hurt so I confronted her in the morning. I found out the club event didn\u2019t even open doors until 11pm and checked her location (we share) that she didn\u2019t leave her apartment until 11, with a few insta stories of her pregaming with her friends in her apt around 10:30. We live 5 minutes away from each other and the club is a few blocks down so it\u2019s not like she had some huge commute to rush to.\n\nI told her about how hurt I was and why she couldn\u2019t even step in for 30 minutes  considering the party started at 7pm and her \u201cexcuse\u201d for not attending didn\u2019t even start until 10:30-11pm. I wouldn\u2019t mind at all if she gave me a heads up that her plans changed instead of making things awkward in front of all my guests, but she literally confirmed she was attending the day before. She just brushed off my concerns and said that people have different priorities, and how I should appreciate her gesture to stop by to drop off flowers.\n\nAfter this I told her clearly we aren\u2019t as close as I thought and distanced myself from her. She reaches out and wants to make up but is adamant she did nothing wrong. A few mutual friends think I overreacted and it was a thoughtful gesture but others think she was selfish and inconsiderate of an important event of a close friend.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690679073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d87vc/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_close_friend_after_she/", "score": 789, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Friend made promises she didn't keep, blew you off for an ex, chose other people to hang out with on a day that she knew was special to you, then dismissed the damage she did.

It's understandable to feel hurt when someone you consider a \"close friend\" confirms she'll attend your birthday party and then shows up very late with an excuse that doesn't seem to hold up.\n\nShe could have communicated her change of plans beforehand to avoid awkwardness and it's unfortunate that she brushed off your concerns when you confronted her.\n\nDoes she have any issue with the other people who attended your party?

That, I think, would have been fine.", "NTA - You do not seem to be a high priority for your friend at this time. At least she dropped off flowers. Dropped off, when she could have spend a couple of hours there. Strange behavior from a friend.", "NTA.  Your friend was not honest with you and that matters.  She clearly had time to pop in a bit longer but instead she blew your party completely off.  I can understand your confusion and disappointment in her.  That said, only you can decide if you care to forgive and go forward or not.", "NTA but she's not as close of a friend as you thought and you've invested too much emotionally in this relationship. Sure, people can have different priorities. But your birthday wasn't about her, it was about you and she didn't prioritize you at all. I'd be hurt too.", "Nah you're reacting appropriately. She's made it clear you're not a priority so treat her accordingly", "NTA, I would feel hurt and like we weren\u2019t really friends and she didn\u2019t value me. I don\u2019t think you overreacted and had every right to confront her. She literally told you she was going to be there.

Politely distance yourself", "You deserve a better friend.\n\nNTA.", "communication is key.", "NTA. I would be hurt too if my \"bestie\" did that to me. 25 is considered a big birthday in my friends and family group. It's a quarter century!! I'm a big believer in matching energies, so I would go forward with the friendship the same way she is. It sounds like she blew you off because getting \ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46 was more important to her than you were. I'm sorry. Happy Birthday BTW!!!", "NTA. You are obviously NOT a priority to her. Time to take the trash out.", "NTA\n\nAlso, she's not your friend any longer.", "NTA - of course you\u2019re upset. She straight up told you that she would rather go clubbing with her ex than attend your bday celebration and then shrugged and said people have different priorities- as in you aren\u2019t it. \nFlower drop off is fine. I probably wouldn\u2019t have confronted her about her actions. Wouldn\u2019t have been worth my energy but for sure I would take note of this and back off the relationship because you\u2019re right, you are not as close as you thought.", "So you didn't even take her gift to her, you didn't even make an attempt to see her to mark her birthday after she got back.

Friendships can ebb and flow, is it really blowing up a friendship for?  I am proud you let her know how you feel, but maybe ask what the deal was with her clubbing night?  Was there a celebrity DJ?  Wanting to connect with her ex?  Get the whole story before you write her off.", "YTA.\n\nA lot of things change as you get older. Two things that most people would agree on is:\n\n1. Your birthday isn\u2019t something so important after a certain age. \n2.

When my mom turned 60, we had a massive party for her. I've literally never heard anyone claim that birthdays are less important as you age until I joined reddit.

However, isn't it also important to genuinely care and prioritize our friendships, even if it's in the simplest gestures?

Personally it seems likely to me that Rachel had some reason she didn\u2019t want to go and weighed how to handle it while still showing she valued OP.
