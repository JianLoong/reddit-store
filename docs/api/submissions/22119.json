That was how it went ... until I had meningitis, and my dad dismissed it for several hours until my mother came home. I was in hospital for weeks, I nearly died.\n\nMy dad felt *awful* about it. He realised that he had created a situation where I wouldn't tell him about my illnesses because of his reaction. He apologized to me, and he adjusted the way he behaved. When I had appendicitis about ten years later, he was the one to immediately say we should go to a doctor, and I was able to get surgery before it burst. The important thing is that he *learned* from the experience and ensured it would never happen again.\n\nYou need to take note of the fact that your son doesn't feel able to communicate with you about his health without you prioritising something else. That is an atmosphere *you* created. You got lucky this time in that it sounds like your son will be ok, but that may not be the case next time. Apologise to your son.

Or they too far up your ass? Yta", "You really should have listened to your son.  What if it was his appendix?

Did you even stop to take a temp or anything or ask how it bothered him?  You owe him a big apology.", "YTA. He did use his words and you dismissed them.", "YTA.

I'd then try to tough it out and watch the ballet recital, because this was my sister's thing, and it was important to her, and I wanted to see her dance, and because I wouldn't want to ruin the day for her.\n\nAnd then once everything is done, either it's getting worse, or better, or about the same. If it's the same or better, I'll probably ignore it. If it's worse, I'll say something.\n\nIt sounds like this is mostly what he did, and you complained at him for it.

Even if it wasn't nearly as bad as meningitis - been there, done that. To this day especially my father doesn't take my symptoms seriosuly and it's hell because it makes it even harder to advocate for myself when I'm at the doctor who can be biased, too sometimes (\"young woman = can't be ill\").\n\nPlease always take your children's sysmptoms seriously!

At what point do you believe him? You created this situation and you're still trying to blame him. You need to apologize and accept responsibility for what YOU did.", "Why would he? You already made it clear that you did not believe him. Or care.", "Sounds like the damage was done from your initial reaction. He's 15, he hasn't learned to advocate for himself yet, and was probably fearful of your reaction. Just say sorry to him.", "Sounds like you're the type of parent kids avoid in danger instead of seeking assistance. You must be wonderful to have around. That even in hospital your son has to be silent to avoid you. Hmm. I wonder why?", "Well, your point is a crappy one.", "What a pathetic excuse. \ud83d\ude02 You're grasping at straws here\n\nJust let go of your pride and apologize! \n\nDon't blame your son any further.", "You already shut him down, and you're asking \"why didn't he try again after I completely ignored him?!\"", "He tried you failed YTA.  Just read the post you hush about your daughter\u2019s prestigious ballet school and insinuate your son is a liar in the first paragraph.  Then turn it around into his fault for not telling you what he already had.", "Because they believe the 2nd time would have been when the golden child was off stage. At that point, they would accept that their scape goat kid actually needed medical attention, or might have at least asked a question or two about symptoms. This is asshole logic 101."]}
