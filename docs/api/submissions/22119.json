That was how it went ... until I had meningitis, and my dad dismissed it for several hours until my mother came home. I was in hospital for weeks, I nearly died.\n\nMy dad felt *awful* about it. He realised that he had created a situation where I wouldn't tell him about my illnesses because of his reaction. He apologized to me, and he adjusted the way he behaved. When I had appendicitis about ten years later, he was the one to immediately say we should go to a doctor, and I was able to get surgery before it burst. The important thing is that he *learned* from the experience and ensured it would never happen again.\n\nYou need to take note of the fact that your son doesn't feel able to communicate with you about his health without you prioritising something else. That is an atmosphere *you* created. You got lucky this time in that it sounds like your son will be ok, but that may not be the case next time. Apologise to your son.

Or they too far up your ass? Yta", "You really should have listened to your son.  What if it was his appendix?

Did you even stop to take a temp or anything or ask how it bothered him?  You owe him a big apology.", "YTA. He did use his words and you dismissed them.", "YTA.

I'd then try to tough it out and watch the ballet recital, because this was my sister's thing, and it was important to her, and I wanted to see her dance, and because I wouldn't want to ruin the day for her.\n\nAnd then once everything is done, either it's getting worse, or better, or about the same. If it's the same or better, I'll probably ignore it. If it's worse, I'll say something.\n\nIt sounds like this is mostly what he did, and you complained at him for it.

Because of this condition and be pregnant, my heart was extremely over worked and that's what caused the SCAD. My parents both asked why I never told them I felt that bad.

When I was a kid my parents accused me of faking it because \"my stomach always hurts\" and I was forced to power through it.\n\nNow I'm in my 30s and have either had to cancel plans with family, or spend my entire visit at their house either in the bathroom or sick on the couch.\n\nNow instead of \"you're faking it\" it's \"yeah you've always had stomach issues, we understand\"\n\nWHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE FIRST 18 YEARS!?!?", "The fun thing about appendicitis is that you only get that once. After it's gone, you can rule it out any time you get a tummyache\n\nSource: Had appendectomy + herniated complications a year or two before it became a \"simple procedure\"", "Which suggests to me that it\u2019s not the first time a need of his has gone unacknowledged. It\u2019s the same reason neglected infants stop crying when they\u2019re hungry or their diaper needs changing. Once they internalize that their crying has no effect on anything, they just give up. \n\nThe son sounds like he gave up long before this incident.", "It's ballet.... At a church. He can love her to pieces and still not want to go, even if he's  well. Just like she's free to not watch him game or play hockey or whatever he does. \n\nAnd the title should be AITA for assuming my sick, poorly dressed, *teenage boy* was lying and forcing him to watch my daughter's (who is going to a very prestigious dance school) recital? \n\nI get the feeling she isn't a boy mom, or even an equal mom", "This, missed so much because of  this", "My sister also did this lmao. There are def kids who fake it as a weapon. Obvs. in OP's case the son wasn't faking but it is def an excuse people of all ages use to get out of things lbr.", "Oh man, poor you! You deserved better.", "Do you honeslty expect any of us (including your son) to think you would've believed him if he complained about his stomach hurting again? Is \"my stomach STILL hurts\" not another kid excuse in your book?\n\nYou owe him an apology. \"I'm sorry. I should've believed you when you said your stomach hurt. I'll listen to you and trust you more in the future\". It's that simple\n\nWhy, if your kids are so close, did you think he would lie to get out of it?", "And you could have used *your* words as well. Does your son have a history of trying to weasel out of attending his sister\u2019s dance recitals (this can\u2019t be her first one)? He\u2019d already promised his sister he was coming, and you say they\u2019re close, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like trying to drag a kid to church who doesn\u2019t want to go. \n\n*You* could have asked him where it hurts and when (like if it\u2019s tender to the touch or sitting up makes it worse). *You* could have said, \u201clet\u2019s try and go, but sit near the back and let me know if it gets worse.\u201d *You* could have listened instead of immediately brushed him off. Of course he didn\u2019t use his words, because you showed him that you don\u2019t listen to them, and aren\u2019t willing to use them yourself.", "Do you expect him to badger you? You did not believe him when he told you, so why would he tell you again? I can see that maybe you don't treat your children the same. Yta", "He did tell you, you didn\u2019t listen. You\u2019re the parenr not the child. You\u2019re upset and taking it out on your son. And deep down you know it.

You\u2019ve got a golden child and it isn\u2019t your son, and he knows it. \n\nLet\u2019s ignore the fact that you dismissed him when he told you he wasn\u2019t feeling well.

It really sucks to not be the favorite.", "You are not a good parent.", "Why?  You wouldn't have believed him. You didn't believe him the first time.

DID. FUCKING. TELL. YOU. You didn't believe him the first goddamn time, what exactly makes you think he'd believe that you'd listen when he told you a second time?!", "He did tell you. You told him to suck it up and go to his sisters recital and not ruin it for her. \n\nHe told you. You refused to listen then blamed him.", "You showed him that you wouldn\u2019t take seriously anyway, so why would he told you?", "You thought he was lying.", "why would he tell you it got worse when you ignored him earlier? and treated him like his sickness was inconveniencing you?", "He did express it.  You blew him off.  You chose to not do anything about it, so stop trying this line here.", "Like what? Tell him to drink water?", "He did tell you. God you're insufferable", "you're a really bad parent lol", "What you actually mean is you would have maybe cared enough to do something AFTER the recital was over and it was not as huge of an inconvenience for YOU. \n\nAll of this is about you with no concern at all for your son or how your actions put him in serious danger. Not his actions, *yours*.", "I have no words for you\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get banned. You\u2019re a\u2026. Special kind of\u2026 not smart.", "He\u2019s a kid!

Which is why we parents have to do more investigating, not just dismiss a health complaint as \u201cthe oldest excuse in the book.\u201d\n\nTruth is, you didn\u2019t want him to inconvenience you in that moment, that\u2019s why you ignored him and why you feel bad now. He knows it, you know it. \n\nJust admit it, apologize, and do better going forward.", "Even so, what\u2019s the point in getting hung up on that? You\u2019re acting like him getting worse is his fault.\n\nHe is 100% right, take some responsibility!

I know kids BS sometimes, but everyone in this story is very lucky he is alive to be mad at you.  It is an unearned privilege that you now have the opportunity to regain his trust.", "HE DID TELL YOU! YOU DISMISSED HIM! \n\nI don\u2019t  know what else you expected him to do. If he did anything else you would have accused him of being dramatic! Oh you already did that my bad!", "After so if he was dying mid way through the recital he would still have to wait?", "So you don't deny that you consider her recital to be more important than his pain? What a worthless excuse for a 'parent' you are.", "Holy Cow!  Who is the parent?   You should have asked him yourself to gauge if he was okay, over it or fibbing. \n\nI have a child that faked sick multiple times to get out of school or go places he didn\u2019t want too.  I understand the fine line of knowing if it is fake to might be true.  \n\nYou never just shut off all caring for a child like you did.", "Stop digging yourself a hole and admit that you wanted to see your daughter perform and that your daughter is the golden child.", "Why didn't you ask clarifying questions about his symptoms? You're the parent. It's your job to take care of him. \"He's old enough to use his words.\" He did. You didn't want to listen. It's one thing to doubt what a teenager says. But it's another to not be an adult and show him concern and basically tell him to \"suck it up.\" Do better. Go to therapy for communication skills. YTA.", "Yta. You failed him when you didn\u2019t listen to him when he told you exactly what was wrong, and failed him again- monumentally- when you turned it around and blamed HIM for not telling you he didn\u2019t feel well- take responsibility, be a better parent. Shitty. I mean you should be embarrassed for the way you\u2019re acting NOW. You made a mistake, you\u2019re supposed to be an adult, you should have just apologized.", "Isn't that how he ended up at the doctors?", "Oh, right. He could have said something AFTER. Fine for him to sit through it in pain after you had made it clear that he was \"faking\" but afterward, then you would know it was the truth. Silly boy. Can't imagine why he didn't read your mind on that one.   \nYTA, you know it, and at this point you are just moving the goalposts so you look better. It isn't working. Apologize to your son.", "What's the point?  You made it clear you didn't give a damn the first time he told you.", "It doesn't matter if it got worse. To him, you already established that you didn't care about the fundamental problem.\n\nYou seem very dedicated to the idea that he should have complained again, so that you knew it was real. You assume that his logic goes something like this: \"Telling this to mom/dad before the event will make it look like I'm trying to get out of it. If I wait until during or after the event, when there's not a chance I'm just trying to get out of this event, they'll know I'm being a good kid and telling the truth.\"\n\nWhen it turned out he was really sick, you should have immediately understood that his logic was: \"I am sick and in pain and told mom/dad, and they don't care.\" \n\nThere's this thing called \"theory of mind.\" Basically, it's understanding that other people don't experience things the same way you do or have the same thoughts you do. Your story, and your repeated defenses that \"he should have said something later\" make it seem like you need to do some work developing your own theory of mind. Until then, YTA.", "Why? So you could say it was an excuse again? Even now, instead of just apologizing to him for not believing him you are trying to paint yourself as the victim, which you aren't.", "HE SHOULDN\u2019T HAD TO HAVE TOLD YOU TWICE! He said he was feeling I\u2019ll and you dismissed him, and now your argument is \u201cwell he should\u2019ve told me how bad it was AFTER the recital\u201d that shows how your daughters show was more important than his health. Now people in your life and online are telling you that YTA and you\u2019re still being a dense fuck and arguing the same stupid thing.", "You don't have a point. He ended up in the hospital because of your negligence. There is no other way to look at it, as much as you try to blame him. He went to the hospital because you didn't take his infirmity seriously, and then you had the nerve to make it his fault. Every single instinct of yours around this situation was **pure garbage.**\n\nYou just refuse to accept any accountability, don't you? This is yet another reason why you're the asshole.\n\nYou keep harping on this point of \"why didn't he use his words and say something\" when you personally created a hostile environment for his feelings and his pain. Get over yourself. You failed your child and tried to make it his fault after dismissing him. What horrible parenting. Shame on you.", "Why? To be dismissed by you again?", "Well my general point in bringing up their relationship was OP's implication of ill intent. If they have a mutually supportive relationship normally there would be no reason for her to assume malice on her son's part.", "Holy gender stereotypes batman! He's a boy, so of course he's not going to like dance. And she's not going to like boy things like hockey!", "The only problem with that was he never expressed he didn't want to go, before getting sick.", "notice how multiple people have pointed this out and she\u2019s missing the point entirely. \u201che could\u2019ve told me it got worse\u201d he felt he couldn\u2019t that\u2019s the damn point. she\u2019s ignoring this valid point the way she ignored her son \ud83d\ude44", "I look forward to the time he is able to do so.
