And really after a certain age, \"Girlfriend/boyfriend\" sounds a tad juvenile.", "NTA, he sounds exhausting.", "NTA - honestly, I know several people who intensely dislike the term \"partner\" (some of them are gay) but it seems like a pretty unobtrusive catch all term to me. You definitely don't need to apologize for using it, but now that your brother has stated his preference, call Ann his girlfriend. End of story.", "NTA and do not do not apologize. Give him a dictionary instead.", "I have to say I don't like the term \"partner\" either and it always makes me cringe a bit, it just sounds so cold and clinical... like you have a medical practice or an accounting firm together... but it has become widely accepted.\n\nNTA, you did nothing wrong.", "I'm nonbinary and this is a very sweet and considerate gesture, NTA! but next time wear a cowboy hat and say \"this is my siblin' and his pardner *tip hat here* say howdy e'rry body!\" In a really thick Texan accent", "NTA. You used partner to try to be respectful (I use partner unless I'm certain their status/what they want referred to) and explained you would use girlfriend in the future. \n\nDoesn't seem to warrant the need for an apology and just to reiterate NTA.", "NAH. He's made his preference known now, so in the future, introduce her as his girlfriend.", "Honestly, you brother sounds uneducated and wants special treatment, NTA.\n\nA girlfriend is a partner.", "NTA - \"partner\" is just as neutral a term as \"spouse\", and in 10 years if Bro is married to Ann, I'm reasonably certain he wouldn't be upset about Ann being referred to as his spouse. Sounds rather like he's got some opinions about the word \"partner\" that he should divorce himself from.", "I\u2019m 46 and feel like I\u2019ve outgrown the phrase \u201cboyfriend/girlfriend\u201d and appreciate the term partner", "NTA. IME people often use partner for same sex partners when being vague, so I bet he was worried that it made it sound like maybe his girlfriend was queer or something. That's his problem and I wouldn't apologise either.", "This strikes me as another pronouns situation where you just use their preferred pronoun once they've told you.", "NTA, after he told you his preference you agreed to change your language in his case. Ot's not something offensive, it's not something that dictates an apology. This feels homophobic/transphobic because while I have straight friends who also call each other partners, it was popularized by referring to relationships within the LGBTQ community. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA. Your brother is being super weird. Is his girlfriend maybe a trans girl? I don\u2019t wanna say your brother is TA without more context. I know I get pretty adamant when I date a trans girl about people referring to her as my girlfriend. But that\u2019s for her comfort not mine. \n\nIf she\u2019s just a cis girl then like. Idk there\u2019s no reason to be that offended? There was no reason to be that offended, anyway", "NTA", "Um, no, it doesn't mean that everywhere. Everywhere I've lived, it's a gender neutral term for boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, or wife. And this was not a sitcom moment where Bro was trying to avoid giving the girl the idea they're exclusive and insist \"She's not my GIRL-FRIEND, we're just dating.\"", "Not at all. You can't be that dense.", "I would never get upset at the use of partner.", "It is clear he is triggered by the word. I don't think you can claim he is homophobic solely off the details in this post. It might just be some toxic masculinity.", "I agree, partner to me connotates either a spouse or serious long-term relationship. A year is right on that edge, but partner also indicates cohabitation in my mind.\n\nObviously nta, though.", "For sure!", "or just generally bigoted against any non-traditional relationship structure such as polyamory, the term \"partner\" is common there too", "Exactly. I hate the term boyfriend or girlfriend. I'm 40. I'm not a girl. He's not a boy. Partner is a totally reasonable thing to call the adult person you're in a relationship with. The brother is just looking for something to be offended about.", "> Calling a person only a boyfriend or girlfriend can feel slightly childish or insufficient\n\nThat's probably OP's brother's issue. He doesn't see this relationship as serious and \"partner\" sounds serious. \n\nTo follow the grand AITA tradition of jumping to wild conclusions from a few lines of text, I wonder if it's a point of contention between him and Ann (a year is a long time to be casual) and so this hit a particular sore spot. If other people start thinking of his relationship with Ann as serious because they were told she's his *partner*, she's going to push the issue even harder and he'll either have to commit to a higher degree than he wants to or get dumped.\n\nIt would explain why he's demanding an apology instead of just moving on like a sensible person would.", "I'm coming to conclusions based on actions. Can you think of another reason to be so angry?", "This.  Girlfriend/boyfriend sound like you never emotionally moved on from high school.", "Did your brother want you to apologize to him or to Ann? Who did he think was hurt?", "Toxic masculinity", "Gay and in the closet because he hasn't come to terms with it, is another possibility.", "The homophobic brand of toxic masculinity", "Internalized homophobia is sad", ">OP did something very similar here.\n\nNo\n\n>He said he didn't like it. I said in the future I would call Ann his girlfriend. \n\nOnce the brother said he didn't like the term \"partner\" the OP changed their behavior.\n\n>The girl is not his partner. Why? Because the brother and his gf are the ones that define the terms of his relationship, not OP and not you or I.\n\nLanguage is not personal. The only way that words have meaning is through communal recognition. The fact that the brother doesn't like the term doesn't make it untrue.\n\nFor a slightly different example say I go up to a bro and say \"Hey, those are some nice looking pink shorts.\" and he goes \"They aren't pink, they're *salmon*\". I wouldn't go \"oh, okay, they're salmon not pink\". I would probably say \"Yeah, and '*salmon'* is a shade of pink, ~~dumbass~~\"\n\nNow why might the brother not want to use the the term partner? There are a number of possibilities such as:\n\n* His gf is trans and she prefers people use terms that positively affirm her gender\n* He feels \"partner\" implies a greater sense of commitment than he currently feels towards his girlfriend.\n\nThese are both fine reasons to prefer the term girlfriend, but neither make \"partner\" untrue. It might not be the most descriptive option, but it is still technically correct because \"partner\" is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of relationships.", "Toxic masculinity is inherintly homophobic and transphobic.", "Thank you, I couldn't think of the word internalised (brain fog).  Yeah, it is.  I've met a couple of people who experienced it they let a lot of anger go once they were open with themselves and others about who they were.", "You don't see the similarity between using a gender neutral pronoun (\"they\") and a gender neutral term for a relation (\"partner\")? That feels like a pretty obvious similarity to me.\n\nOf course aspects of language are personal. For many, many years, things like dictionaries, doctors, textbooks, government agencies, etc. tried to tell trans people they had to use the pronouns associated with the gender of their birth (and they sometimes still try). That doesn't mean it's correct. \n\nIf language isn't personal, why do you agree that OP should stop using partner for his brother's girlfriend?\n\nEither way, I'm clearly not changing your mind on this, and you are not changing mine. Therefore, there's a good chance this is my last comment on the issue. Without sarcasm, have a good rest of your day."]}
