My mum is a lesbian and while she was always comfortable talking about her girlfriend, there were plenty of couples around when I was growing up who did always refer to each other as 'partner.' And when I asked why, it was explained to me that it was because it was deliberately ambiguous. If people are homophobes they can choose to interpret it as 'business partner' or 'tennis partner' or whatever, or if people felt unsafe they could fall back on that explanation themselves.

Maybe because it was a rich, liberal high school in California, but in my friend group pretty much everyone was gay, and still used boyfriend/girlfriend. Partner always sounded like a business deal or something. I live in England now and I think partner is more common?
