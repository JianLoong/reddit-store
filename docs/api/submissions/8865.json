I personally think partner is better than boyfriend and girlfriend because of how many refer to non romantic partner of the same gender.

It is also common to call boys that are your friends if you are also a boy \"boyfriends\" in a purely platonic situation.  I don't know how prevalent that is elsewhere but I live in Kansas and it can be pretty Bible belt so even my peers and my kids friends call friends of the same gender girlfriends or boyfriends, especially in childhood and early teen years.", "NTA.

Partner is the most neutral option.
