The relationship broke down because we disagreed on many, many things when our son was diagnosed with speech delays and we were warned about a potential diagnosis of a stutter we were being prepared for. Our son ended up diagnosed with a stutter a few months later and when he was almost 5 a diagnosis of selective mutism, related to the stutter was diagnosed. Ex and I have disagreed on his therapies and how to help him from the beginning. But now he's all bothered about it. He's due to get married in April and our son has never spoken one word to his fianc\u00e9e, her children or her parents who are a big part of her/their lives. They have been together for 2 years and my son has known her and her kids for a year. Apparently they wanted all four kids (she has three) to make a speech together about being a family but with our son not speaking in crowds and not speaking to them since they met, he is now on my ass about pushing my son and increasing therapy to get him talking at this wedding. He said it's the most important thing and should be the main focus. This, when our son doesn't speak in class, only has a couple of teachers he will speak to privately and when it has impacted his education and ex never shows up to IEP meetings for him.\n\nI told him I would not force our son to speak and I was not going to overwhelm him with therapy (speech therapy and play therapy) just for his wedding day. He told me this is about our son making the most of the most important day in his young life and that he needs to be able to talk during it. I told him you can't force progress. He said he has plenty of time to make it through a speech for his family. I told him if he wants to work with him in his home and if he wants to take him to therapy on his weeks (I take him even on ex's time since he never makes time for it) and see if they can make that a small goal, he was free to. Ex told me therapy is on me and I should want this for our son.\n\nOur son is 8 btw. His stutter makes his speech pretty bad and the anxiety surrounding his stutter makes this whole thing a vicious cycle, and yes, I am proactive and we have worked with different therapists over the years but none of this is easy.\n\nEx is mad at me and told me I was being a spiteful, bitter ex and that I am not concerned with my son being comfortable with his family and making the most of a family moment because it's ex's side.

His father\u2019s wedding to a woman other than his mother is not his *eight year old\u2019s* most important day. How about when he walked for the first time? Learned to ride a bike? Baked a cake he loved with his grandma? Cuddled with mom all day watching all his favorite movies? Christmas? The first New Year\u2019s Eve he got to stay up until midnight? The day he trusted a beloved teacher and could speak privately to them? The day he went to the dentist and was brave and then got to listen to the Encanto soundtrack all the way home?\n\nI could go on and on making up things that are more important than his dad\u2019s wedding where he\u2019s going to be forced to speak.\n\nDad wants to traumatize son, and you\u2019re right not to endorse it. Dad wants this for himself and himself only. That is no way to parent.", "Your ex is toxic. Even without said diagnosis most kids that age would have difficulty speaking in such a situation, why is he setting your son up for embarrassment?", "NTA. Forcing your son to participate is likely to cause him trauma. Your ex is being selfish and doesn't seem at all concerned about how this will affect your son.\n\n>He told me this is about our son making the most of the most important day in his young life and that he needs to be able to talk during it.\n\nYour ex's wedding is absolutely *not* the most important day in your son's life.\n\n>Ex is mad at me and told me I was being a spiteful, bitter ex and that I am not concerned with my son being comfortable with his family and making the most of a family moment because it's ex's side.\n\nYou *are* concerned about what is best for your son, which is what your ex should be concerned about too.", "NTA. Your ex is horrible for forcing an 8 year old to make a speech to appease his soon to be wife. \n\nI have three children. One was very shy and could never have spoken in public. I can\u2019t imagine torturing him by forcing him to speak in front of a crowd. IMHO, that would amount to abuse. \n\nI suggest you have ex over and in front of him, ask son if he wants to speak at the wedding.", "NTA, it seems unreasonable to make this demand of a child whether they have speech impediments or not, and to try and force one who does? Its better to just find something different to have at the wedding than this. No, this is selfishness and not accepting of the diagnoses or even putting any effort in helping. \n\nNo, you're in the right and he needs to change his plans. Keep sticking up for your child.", "NTA, your ex is one though.", "Eww this is very performative to me. He didn\u2019t care about your sons speech impediment until it might make him look bad, because if he cared about your son and wasn\u2019t pushing all of his children to make a performative speech, he would be happy that your son is attending however he feels comfortable. \n\nNTA", "NTA. tell your ex that his marriage is not your son\u2019s most important day. Would be never. And you also don\u2019t give a damn about it. If he is embarrassed that his bio son shutters then he would not attend the marriage all together.", "NTA. He wants a \"family moment?\" How about he comes up with one that celebrates and includes his ACTUALY FAMILY and isn't some Pinterest/TikTok/Instagram moment where everyone makes a perfect speech and then everyone cries?\n\nJesus Christ. I bet there are a million things your son could do to recognize the marriage -- draw a picture or write something or something that doesn't activate his anxiety. But your ex doesn't want to meet your son where he is. \n\nI hope your ex isn't planning on a close relationship with your son as he gets older.", "NTA -- Your ex is.  Way too much pressure for the kid.", "NTA.  This is a classic example of \"best interests of the child.\"", "NTA ex doesn't seem to care about your kid much. What a horrible thing for them to try and force.", "NTA! You\u2019re not being spiteful, you\u2019re looking out for your son. Watch your ex carefully if he is already behaving like this and let your son know he can be open and honest with you without getting in trouble. Your ex should probably go to a therapy appointment too with your sons specialist so they can go through with him how this is not a good idea for your son.  It interesting the one thing they want the kids to do is something they know your son struggles with.  Can they not have them play a different part or just let them be kids and stop trying to force them to actively help them play out some dream wedding.", "NTA. This whole thing pisses me off so much. Why are they dragging the kids into this at all? Not every blended household is an actual blended family, which should be perfectly fine. But using the kids to project this image they want everyone to believe is gross.", "NTA - What makes this so awful is that your ex isn't willing to even take him to therapy for the issue.  It would be interesting to see what a clinical psychologist would say as to the impact of trying to force him.  As a side note, have you introduced any music to your son.  There are a lot of cases where people who stutter don't have an issue when they sing.  Maybe a guitar and some lessons may help open your son up and give him some confidence in other ways.  Another option might be to use cards for your son to \"say\" his part of the speech.  I am a firm believer in meeting people at where they are at in life, and not where you want them to be.  I understand the idea of your ex wanting to make this about coming together as a family, although I don't agree with the methodology.  Instead of forcing his son into something he isn't comfortable with, why can't he include him in a way that is meaningful for everyone?", "NTA.  Most important day in his young life?  Your ex sounds like a piece of work.  If he has not shown any interest in following up on your son\u2019s progress before he is being selfish and self-centered. If he does decide to work with him I\u2019d actually be concerned that he would push too hard and interfere with the progress being made by the professionals.", "NTA. For him to have this expectation is selfish and for him to view this as \"the most important day in his young life\" is pretty self centered. I completely agree with you - if he feels it is a small goal then he can put forth the effort- it's something he SHOULD be helping with anyway.", "How does your ex expect your son to ever be comfortable with his new family members if he forces him to make a speech in front of them when he has a stutter...? that's basically putting him on full display and saying \"look, my kid is different.\" I completely fail to see the logic in this. He is going to traumatize and humiliate his own son in front of his new family and for what? To appease the new wife? NTA but your ex definitely is", "Ok, maybe I've been in this sub too long, BUT this feels like a set up! The fiance wants a child that has never spoken 1 word to her in a solid year to give a speech in front of a crowd? A speech, along with her children... which is obviously not going to work and then what happens during the meltdown that's sure to follow? Is putting your child in the spot like this supposed to suddenly make him speak perfectly? Or is this some kind of display to paint him as 'the bad kid' that fiancee has to tolerate? What is really going on here? This is not a rational request considering she has never even heard him utter one word! Also public speaking is the number one fear people have! So ...why?????", "No you're NTA. You just care about your son and aren't forcing unrealistic and scarring expectations on him. I can definitely understand why he is your ex. I just can't understand how his fiancee would willingly marry a man who would do that to his son.", "NTA\n\nEven if you made it a goal to work on during therapy and he works on it, there's no guarantee that when that days comes, your son will be able to speak under that pressure. \n\nYour Ex is being both self-centered and selfish here. His next marriage isn't the \"most important day\" in your son's young life, and the fact that your Ex thinks it is, means he doesn't even think of your son as an individual separate from him. \n\nIf your Ex wants your son to accomplish this, it's on Ex to work with your son to accomplish this. And the reality is that because Ex doesn't have any empathy for your son, and doesn't regard your son as an individual, the chances of anything him doing resulting in this goal being met are slim to none.", "NTA. There is a line between setting healthy stressors encouraging progress and *ableism*. \n\nYour Ex sounds like he\u2019s crossed the line. People with disabilities don\u2019t need to be \u201cfixed\u201d. They need room to *be* and supports. Your Ex is only focusing on his own pleasure and his social capital. He is demanding your son perform for his whim. He\u2019s not *seeing* his son; your son\u2019s strengths, and character. He\u2019s only seeing disability and is annoyed by it. \n\nHe could have played to your son\u2019s strengths and shown acceptance by working within your son\u2019s comfort zone. *If your son like the idea and **consents** to it* For example: writing a speech and having someone read it for him, or write out the speech on large white cards the audience can read and have your son cue through them silently to music (truly this would be kind of sweetly adorkable) or have your son make a video or PowerPoint he can set to music and click through. So many options to obtain participation that works to your son\u2019s strengths. What a shame your Ex is only seeing *what can\u2019t* and is blind to *what can*.\n\nAlso\u2026 if you talk with non-verbal, deaf, and autistic adult communities, many are saying drumming these therapies into them as kids has left lasting trauma. They are adamantly telling people their forced therapies were abusive and created social avoidance stressors they are left to cope with as adults.", "NTA he could hold up cards love actually style", "NTA. I see why your ex is your ex. That\u2019s disturbing that he acts this way regarding your son. I 100% agree with you on all of this. Maybe a compromise could be that you help your son write his feelings out that he \u201cwould say in a speech\u201d and someone else read it? That would be the ONLY compromise I would even offer him, if any. And that\u2019s only if your son wants to. If he doesn\u2019t, leave it at NO.", "Nta. You will never be TA for protecting your child.", "OMG you are NTA!!  In what universe is pushing him to engage in public speaking at this point even close to reasonable?!?!?  Helping him to be able to engage with his new step-siblings or to attend the wedding with support seems reasonable, but public speaking is a non-starter.", "NTA \n\nYou are right.\n\nYour ex is being selfish. He is not considering your son at all.\n\nBTW, this is not 'The most important day in your son's life\", Dad. Expecting your son to participate in a public activity about \"family\", when you know that he isn't in his best interest, makes you a HUGE asshole. To support your soon to be spouse's idea of this \"family\" speech, over the well-being of your son,akes you a HUGE asshole.

Your soon to be spouse is also an asshole.", "**NTA** Big stressful family occasions can be big and stressful! it is wrong to force anybody to speak at a wedding/funeral/whatever if they are uncomfortable about it.  And to say they  want a full set of children's speeches is treating the children like actors: just wrong.  (Father's second wedding is \"the most important day in his young life\"?  Spare me!)\n\nBut.\n\nConsider finding another way for the son to celebrate the wedding that isn't a speech.  He's the one to release the balloons (every wedding should have balloons!) or he's the one to ding the glass to get everyone quiet for the speeches.\n\nThat way he's taking part in a way he might enjoy and which contributes to everybody's merriment.", "NTA. Your son is not comfortable with the situation. Why force him?  Lol, I would say something like \u201cif you care about it that much, you can try to get him to do it, but I really hope he doesn\u2019t ruin the moment for you\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Go to a professional and discuss it!  Go to see the professional most involved in the therapy. Consult with them about your ex\u2019s request.

It's funny since he's accusing you of the very things he is doing. \n\nHe's trying to force your son into a VERY traumatic situation for his own comfort.

He wants to show off his new \\*perfect\\* family and is upset your son isn't fitting into the picture exactly like he wants him to. \n\nHonestly at this point it's become normal for men to act like toddlers and expect to be coddled yet act like everyone else are the one's acting like that.  \n\nIt's become abundantly clear that the majority of the last few generations of men have simply not been raised.
