Old fashioned gangstas, a teenager getting involved with a weapon and then turn it into a surprise wedding? Its unique, I'll give her that. I know the dancing down the aisle bit is a thing people have been doing for awhile now. But you aren't obligated to play and/or dance along.

So help her find a better way to transition from \"your costume is awesome\" to \"I'm getting married.\"\n\n3) is there a reason you don't want to dance?
