I'm in Europe where shootings are really uncommon. If I was at an event where someone was \"shot\" people would lose their minds and there's no way anyone would recover quickly and feel calm enough afterwards to enjoy a surprise wedding. \n\nI imagine in the US, where mass shootings are common, that trauma would be worse.

Old fashioned gangstas, a teenager getting involved with a weapon and then turn it into a surprise wedding? Its unique, I'll give her that. I know the dancing down the aisle bit is a thing people have been doing for awhile now. But you aren't obligated to play and/or dance along. Maybe try the gentle reminder that less is more and keep it simple?", "Your mom wants a weird wedding but she wants you to walk her down the aisle.. but dancing. For pity's sake.

So help her find a better way to transition from \"your costume is awesome\" to \"I'm getting married.\"\n\n3) is there a reason you don't want to dance?
