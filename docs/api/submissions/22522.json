This all started to sound like a great idea but my wife brought up a valid point that her sister would try to take advantage of us not having kids and we may be looked at to babysit. My sister in-law has 3 kids all range from 3,2, and 1. The sister in-law 4 hours away from us and the kids have no idea who we are, and both my wife and I agree that the kids have 0 raising as the oldeat only grumbles for things and doesnt attemp to talk. They are the definition of a hell spawns. They dont have a set bed time, they dont get told no, and if they dont feeling doing something then they will sit on the ground and throw a tantrum until they get there way. I grew up an only child and my family never had kids after me. And my older cousins never came around alot when there kids were little so I have no experience dealing with small kids. I am used to dealing with kids that were atleast 10 as my parents would go out and leave me in charge of the family friends kids when i was 16. Also to add in i am a white male and having 3 smalls kids around me doesnt look good when I look no more than 21.\n\nMy wife has talking with her mom and sister about the trip and the place they want to stay is an air bnb 2 full rooms with queen beds and 2 other rooms with twin beds in each room. The sister in-law is married and my mother in-law has a steady relationship with a guy who all would be going. This would leave my wife and I to stay in of the rooms with twin beds. I have told my wife every time we get invited to something with her sister they expect something grand from us. Her sister knows what i do for work and knows i make a very high 5 figure salary. For our area that is very good. I told my wife i will not be sleeping in a twin bed for a week after paying our portion of the house and our tickets, that i will get a room at a motel 6 if i had too. We are married and deserve to be treated as such. Her sister is a very hush hush type of person when dealing with anything adult related but we are not. We both know her sister will take advantage of us not wanting to do some rides because my wife does not like specific rides that her sister loves and i wont leave my wife by herself to jus stand and wait by herself for over an hour and her sister will use that as we would be the only ones able to watch all 3 kids. So i told my wife if its gets to that point and they dont want to listen to us we will go home and eat the cost of the trip. Now i am perfectly fine with going,  I just dont like us to be taken advantage of or be treated like kids ourselves. The 3 kids have been to disney before its nothing new for them. In all honesty they wont remember it anyways.

There are tons of places to stay near Disney. Tons of places. Sone are very nice indeed, some are more bargain oriented, you have options. You can find one. With a king size bed and a door that locks, that doesn\u2019t have toddlers on the other side of it.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can find one and book it. \n\nYou aren\u2019t going to Florida to be a babysitter. NTA", "NTA. May want to reconsider going. Maybe Just go somewhere with your wife and have a good time, child and inlaw free", "NTA. Don't share an air bnb with them.  Tell them you prefer to stay at a hotel and will meet up with them at Disney World.", "YWNBTA, but why not simply side-step?  If money isn't an issue for you, then get your own Airbnb or whatever accommodations, and make *that* clear right now.  No need to say a thing about your lack of interest in being the babysitter.  Just make it clear that whatever accommodation you get is just for the two of you, and there's no room for anklebiters.  Prepare your counters for whatever requests or assumptions get hurled your way, and don't back down.  Not your kids, not your responsibility.", "NTA.  Disney World in May is hot as hell, and 3 young children will be miserable after waiting hours to ride Dumbo.  It's too much to expect the childless folks to babysit.  They're not your children.  \n\nDisney World had a lot of amenities, from doggie daycare to a dialysis clinic.  There's *got* to be some kind of childcare available.  \n\nAnd yeah, if you're paying an astronomical amount of money for a Disney vacation, you should at least be able to sleep with your wife.", "NTA\n\nYou are perfectly valid for not wanting the twin beds or to have to babysit the SIL's kids. I would be upfront from the start. When discussions about the trip come up, simply state that you and your wife want a nice bedroom with a queen bed or larger. If that isn't available, you'll be happy to arrange your own accommodations. And leave the ball in their court. That way they can't stick you in the worst room and expect you to split the cost of the AirBnB. They either find something nice for everyone, or everyone books a hotel, or you do your own thing. \n\nWith the rides, simply don't agree to babysit. They are not your kids. SIL and her husband are responsible for their own childcare. If SIL decides to go on some ride your wife doesn't want to go on and says \"oh, can you watch the kids?\" then YOU GRAB YOUR WIFE'S HAND and say, \"Sorry, I'm borrowing her for a few minutes. We'll meet you back here after you're done riding the Haunted Teacups.\" and then take her out for ice cream. She is not your SIL's free babysitting. Simply do not agree. Leave SIL to figure it out. She can watch her own damn kids.", "***INFO:*** Why are you even contemplating going on this trip?\n\n1. Likely to get room with twin beds. Even if given Queen bed, will be grumbled at by either MIL or SIL\n2. Likely to be saddled with lots of babysitting\n3. Already have an escape plan (\"Motel 6\" and eat the cost)\n4. Already dreading trip\n\nYou want to hang out with MIL and SIL? Do a weekend trip nearby first. See how that goes, and what you'll be asked/expected to do. Proceed accordingly.", "NTA.  Take your money and plan a trip somewhere else for just you and your wife.  The trip you have described is a no-win scenario - there is nothing you can do (separate hotel, saying no to watching the kids in Disney, etc.) to make it enjoyable and fair.  Go somewhere else.", "You'll end up regretting agreeing to go on this trip.  You and your wife should go to hawaii and tell the rest of them to have fun!", "Why aren't you getting your own accommodations and doing your own thing at least half the trip? A family trip isn't a forced march of togetherness. You can pick and choose what you do with the family.\n\nAlso, are any of these plans even finalized? It doesn't sound like it.", "Why would you stay at a motel six? Just get your own accommodations separately and meet at the park/for meals or activities. People who suggest you just not go aren\u2019t considering that that solves nothing, and you have to deal with these people forever. Draw firm boundaries, and make sure you and your wife are on the same page about enforcing them.", "My 2 cents is that this isn\u2019t a good combo trip for your family. They will absolutely try to take advantage and you\u2019ll all be miserable and mad. Go to a beach!", "NTA.  Tell them up front and in no uncertain terms that you will\nstay own lodgings & that they can handle theirs.  ASK what babysitting plan has been established.  Maybe offer one evening so the parents can have a date night.  Be firm that you will not take responsibility for their kids daily.", "I don't understand what being a white male has to do with anything, but ok. Doesn't sound like a good time, stay home. NTA.", "INFO\n\nWhy do you think it's a good idea to straight up say it to them, rather than just say no to them if they attempt to put the kids on you?\n\nAnd why not simply ask them who would be taking the twin room, and if they say they expect you/wife to, then go from there.\n\nI don't understand why you are going to zero (or \"maybe 10\") straight to 100.", "NTA. Either they get a house with appropriate bedding for all guests, or you stay somewhere else without them. \n\nAm I missing something? Where is the sister\u2019s husband in all this? Why isn\u2019t he expected to parent his own kids?", "NTA, but you can always ask the Air BNB hosts if it's possible to get the twins pushed together to form a King. I've had hosts that were willing to do this, and had the converter piece available (to get rid of the gap).", "Disney is no place for kids.", "YWNBTA.  Run.", "Don\u2019t go on this family trip. If you can afford to go alone and want to go, do that instead.\n\nNo need to call anyone out. Just don\u2019t go.", "NTA. Sounds awful. Don't go.", "Tell them upfront you will not babysit and ya\u2019ll want a bedroom with a regular bed, not twin beds otherwise ya\u2019ll can stay nearby and meet \u201csometime, somewhere\u201d in the amusement park.", "YTA already for planning on a trip that you dread.\n\nEverything about it is no good, most of all the way you will be drafted for free childcares, the frenzied dream of every SIL on the planet.\n\nIf you're smart you'll cancel.", "YTA\n\nDon't say anything to them.  Just stay home.\n\nIf your wife wants to go, let her go wrangle the toddlers and sleep in a twin bed.\n\nThose children are WAY too young for the theme park experience.\n\nGood Luck", "YWBTA.  If you don\u2019t want to go and your wife does, let her go alone.  If you and your wife are on the same page, you two need to tell your in laws you will be staying elsewhere so they can downsize where they are staying.  If you plan on going with those limitations, you need to state up front before booking that you will not be watching the kids and refuse to stay in a room with twin beds so either they rearrange who gets what room or you two will stay elsewhere.", "You're an asshole.\n\nNot wanting to sleep on a twin bed or watching kids doesn't make you an asshole.
