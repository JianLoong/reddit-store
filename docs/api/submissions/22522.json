This all started to sound like a great idea but my wife brought up a valid point that her sister would try to take advantage of us not having kids and we may be looked at to babysit. My sister in-law has 3 kids all range from 3,2, and 1. The sister in-law 4 hours away from us and the kids have no idea who we are, and both my wife and I agree that the kids have 0 raising as the oldeat only grumbles for things and doesnt attemp to talk. They are the definition of a hell spawns. They dont have a set bed time, they dont get told no, and if they dont feeling doing something then they will sit on the ground and throw a tantrum until they get there way. I grew up an only child and my family never had kids after me. And my older cousins never came around alot when there kids were little so I have no experience dealing with small kids. I am used to dealing with kids that were atleast 10 as my parents would go out and leave me in charge of the family friends kids when i was 16. Also to add in i am a white male and having 3 smalls kids around me doesnt look good when I look no more than 21.\n\nMy wife has talking with her mom and sister about the trip and the place they want to stay is an air bnb 2 full rooms with queen beds and 2 other rooms with twin beds in each room. The sister in-law is married and my mother in-law has a steady relationship with a guy who all would be going. This would leave my wife and I to stay in of the rooms with twin beds. I have told my wife every time we get invited to something with her sister they expect something grand from us. Her sister knows what i do for work and knows i make a very high 5 figure salary. For our area that is very good. I told my wife i will not be sleeping in a twin bed for a week after paying our portion of the house and our tickets, that i will get a room at a motel 6 if i had too. We are married and deserve to be treated as such. Her sister is a very hush hush type of person when dealing with anything adult related but we are not. We both know her sister will take advantage of us not wanting to do some rides because my wife does not like specific rides that her sister loves and i wont leave my wife by herself to jus stand and wait by herself for over an hour and her sister will use that as we would be the only ones able to watch all 3 kids. So i told my wife if its gets to that point and they dont want to listen to us we will go home and eat the cost of the trip. Now i am perfectly fine with going,  I just dont like us to be taken advantage of or be treated like kids ourselves. The 3 kids have been to disney before its nothing new for them. In all honesty they wont remember it anyways.

Hi, so I'm the wife in this post, and I just wanted to add a little more context. My husband and I are taking an anniversary trip this December to Disney World because thats where he proposed, so its special for us. My sister and I have always had tension between us especially because of our mom. My sister is the perfect copy of my mom. They could be twins, so my mom wanted my sister to be just like her and do everything she did. Because of this happening while we were growing up, I was always kind of pushed to the sidelines. Everything I was doing or wanted to do wasn't really a priority. So when I was in high school, I stopped talking to my mom completely and my sister only heard from me when she would visit our grandparents. We've all agreed to put everything that happened in the past behind us and have started to rebuild those relationships. Its just hard for me because my sister told me that all of her pregnancies were surprises because she was told she couldn't have kids and she less them get away with things because she doesn't want to deal with it. \n\nNow context about the kids specifically. The oldest will be turning 4 shortly after the trip and starting school next year. She was born in the middle of the pandemic and my sister uses it as an excuse for her to act however she likes. My sister says she warms up to people after a little while but when she says warms up to people, she really means that the girl starts acting how she does at home. She will walk around grunting for things, isnt allowed to nap but she is expected to stay up until 10-11 pm, and she is very rude. When she doesn't get her way, you would swear is is a 16 year old not 3. For clarification, my sister has always acted this way but our brother and I would get in trouble if we acted that way. The 2 year old is a typical toddler. She has meltdowns and gets tired but she is nicer. Her only thing is she has she has a birth defect that gets worse at the drop of a hat and I've never seen it in person so idk what to do when it happens. The youngest's only thing is he will be a baby and babies are alot.I have no problem watching kids but with all of these things taken into account, I'm not comfortable watching them without my sister, BIL, or both.\n\nMy sister and mom have been planning this trip trying to make it happen since my sister was a senior in high school but because of that everything I say has been kind of glossed over, but if I say something, my mom becomes this master manipulator and it really makes me upset so I feel kind of powerless and it makes me feel worse because this situation is making my husband just as upset so its very tough. I'm definitely the doormat of the family and the big surprise of this is im the youngest of my siblings. Normally its the other way around but I just wanted to give yall a little more context cause everyone's comments seemed divided or were asking questions so I hope this cleared everything up \ud83d\ude0a", "No judgement but please ax the family trip. If you want to go to Disney, go by yourselves. You will thank me later.", "NTA but why even go on this hell ride?

Then you won\u2019t be stuck helping with the kids late at night or early.\n\nAnd if the whole thing is too miserable, you can just tell the, you\u2019re leaving and stay and do what you want. If you like the water, the water parks are actually fun.", "I\u2019d just book your own room from the get go and tell them that on some days you & your wife will be doing your own thing and on the days your with them you won\u2019t be watching the kids. If she can\u2019t handle them she shouldn\u2019t take them. I\u2019m a parent myself and I\u2019ve never expected anyone to watch my child because it\u2019s no one\u2019s responsibility but mine.", "YWNBTA \nTry to book a separate Airbnb or a hotel instead. Stand your ground on not babysitting the kids. If they leave them to you for a ride make sure you hand them back as soon as they get off. \nMake sure your wife is 100% supporting you and keep each other accountable to standing your ground on this. \nThere\u2019s another story I read here about a guy being taken advantage of by her sister on vacation by leaving her kids with him because \u201cshe needed a break\u201d he posted and it blew up reaching his whole family. His parents finally saw his side once everyone on Reddit was calling them bad people and calling out his sister. Hopefully you guys don\u2019t need to go through that extent but make sure you are firm. They are not your responsibility and it was their decision to have kids not yours. \nOr simply book a different vacation and tell the in laws you will see them at the next family gathering.", "Simply decline and don't bother explaining your reasons. DO NOT argue, just grey rock your SIL.   NTA.", "NTA\n\nJust don't go. You already know all the negative aspects that could/will happen. Just take your wife on your own holiday so you don't end up being a babysitter.", "NTA.  I would be booking you and your wife a nice room somewhere else if you do go.  But honestly, you already know what's going to happen so why bother going at all.", "NTA don't pay. To have this entire conversation should tell you no you shouldn't pay for their vacation. If y'all want to go plan separately. Mom and sister can be upset all they want however do not budge.", "NTA. I commend you for posting about this trip well in advance before things have been committed to and deposits are paid\n\nDo not go on this trip. I repeat. Do not go on this trip.\n\nBut if you must ignore this advice.\n\nThen you and your wife insist you\u2019ll find your own accommodation as you won\u2019t be staying together especially in twin beds, and they are responsible for theirs. Do not, under any circumstances plan nor pay for their flights accommodation etc. go seperately, book seperately. And also mention you won\u2019t be babysitting at all.\n\nMake this very clear from the get go. Also do not reveal where you\u2019ve booked to stay. This is how you\u2019ll get ambushed.", "You WNBTA at all. Honestly I\u2019d just stay elsewhere or not go and go yourselves. If you\u2019re anticipating this much conflict going in you\u2019ll be on edge and you won\u2019t even have fun. If you do go, just get your own accommodation elsewhere and let them know before they book their place. You can also just do your own thing, you don\u2019t have to go to the same parks as them everyday, do you own parks and rides, if you see them there that\u2019s fine but no need to follow eachother everywhere and do everything together. You can always meet up and see eachother for dinner. Have your own fun together and enjoy your trip, they can do the same but you\u2019re not obligated at all to revolve your trip or accommodations around them and you should def not be paying to sleep in twin beds, I would put a hard stop on that from the beginning as your first step, be clear that that accommodation will not work for you and you won\u2019t be staying there, then maybe just follow that up with \u201ctake us out of the cost and we will get our own place to stay\u201d. Don\u2019t roll over and let them ruin your trip whatever you do. Put your foot down as soon and as firmly as possible.", "Yup. OP didn't even have to justify so much. If he does not want to spend his vacation, that's that. He is NTA. I do feel that he can try communicating first before starting the name-calling for the children though.", "If a relationship isn't healthy, is it worth having? You are an adult with a loving partner. Make a decision that's best for you, not for them.", "It's ok for your wife to set healthy boundaries, like \"no, I don't want to commit to a week long babysitting trip\"; if they want to bond then offer to babysit for a weekend while they go to a spa.", "My husband isn't in the group chat my sister put me in and they have already been planning out who is responsible for which kids on what rides and when people are sitting out, who will be watching them", "A different Disney every anniversary!", "OMG, just cancel. Don't go. Not your circus, not your flying monkeys.", "Yeah, I want to ask. Is it really that unsafe for him to be seen with  kids and looking younger? I am not from this background and no one would bat an eye from where I am from.", "So what roller coasters did he ride?"]}
