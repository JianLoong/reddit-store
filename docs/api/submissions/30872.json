I don\u2019t know where it comes from, and I recognize it is unhealthy has made me lose a lot of time outdoors in the hotter months.\n\nMy friends all know about this fear and just how bad it is, and it is often a point of joking for them. I don\u2019t mind as we often roast each other and it\u2019s all in good fun. \n\nRecently however, three of them decided to take it upon themselves to \u201cdeal with this fear once and for all.\u201d We live in the country so there\u2019s always fields of bugs and such flying and crawling around all over the place. One afternoon they collected nearly a dozen bees and wasps from outside and trapped them all in my friends screened in porch connected to his house. After luring me inside this porch with promises that we\u2019d be having a chill afternoon of drinks and board games, they ran back inside and locked me in the porch with all these stinging creepy crappies flying all over the damn place.\n\nImmediately realizing my peril, I yelled to let me in the house. They all first laughed as they thought it was funny, but as I felt my heart start to race and realized a panic attack was coming on, I screamed to let me out or I\u2019d break the sliding glass door.\n\nNot believing me, they said the bees were not a big deal and I would see once I got stung that it was not a reasonable fear to have. \n\nI am a medicated individual due to work related anxiety, and have had anxiety attacks in the past where I\u2019ve had to go to the ER, so I took this very seriously. I gave them one more chance to let me in before I\u2019d break the door, and when I saw a paper wasp buzzing right in my face, I grabbed one of the porch chairs and smashed the glass door.\n\nI ran inside and locked myself in the bathroom, hyperventilating and not sure if I was gonna be able to calm myself down. After about 20 minutes of sitting in there and my friends complaining about the door, I got in my car and drove home.\n\nThe next day I get a Venmo request for $400 to replace the glass on the door. I explained that I got trapped in a situation against my will where they knew I had an irrational fear of bugs and that I did not feel responsible for the door as I gave them multiple attempts to let me in.\n\nTwo days later and now the main friend is saying he won\u2019t be inviting me to anything until the $400 is paid, and is threatening to take me to small claims court. I didn\u2019t ask for any of this and feel like my mental health issue was weaponized against me.

I will however point out to them that if he thinks going to court is a good idea, that I could claim things like imprisonment, emotional damages etc. and that it would not hold up in court.

That\u2019s a fair point and I do see a therapist for anxiety and depression, so I\u2019ll likely start to explore this fear of mine in my sessions starting next week.\n\nOverall everybody has been very kind so thank you for all the support and I\u2019ll let you all know if anything happens when I tell this bully he\u2019s getting nothing from me. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.

Your irrational fear isn't about some scenario which is never going to happen, it's about a scenario with will likely happen in your lifetime even if you keep limiting your life as you currently do by limiting time spent outside. Think not only about yourself but a future partner or child whose life you are limiting by not dealing with your irrational and extreme fear for a common bug.\n\nSorry, these 'friends' suck big time, they are for sure not friends. But you need to learn to control your reaction because some day your negligence in dealing with this is going to inadvertently hurt someone else.\n\nPS: Have you ever been stung? It sounds like you aren't allergic or you simply don't know whether you are. Do you have a fear that you MIGHT be allergic and is that part of your irrational fear? If so, why not get tested for wasp and bee sting allergy? If you get confirmation you are not allergic, this might help you with your irrational fear for these bugs? Just a thought. Probably not the whole solution as it sounds like you might benefit from therapy.", "ESH they were assholes for doing that too you and you did warn them.

You should apologise and pay up.", "ESH", "NTA. That was a really shitty thing to do to you. \n\nBy the way, bees generally leave you alone if you\u2019re not swatting at them. They just want the flowers, so get out of the way! And they die after stinging.\n\nWasps, however, are a-holes. They\u2019re aggressive jerks, and can sting repeatedly.", "You are NTA. A phobia is an effing phobia. People who love to play games with other people's mental health are TA. I am massively allergic to bees myself. As in, venom on my skin, not even a sting, caused me to swell up badly and the ER people were like \"NEVER GET STUNG\" - they estimate I'm likely to have less than two minutes before I'd lose my airway, so even an epipen immediately might not do the trick.\n\nI've been paranoid/nervous/scared of bees my entire life (as this is actually a family thing). And I've had people be so damn dismissive of it because ... they don't mind getting stung. So why do I? Ugh. \n\nThat friend who is all \"you aren't coming over until you pay?\" Text back: \"Great, thanks. Trash takes itself out.\" and move on. You owe them nothing. They FAFO. \n\nYou do not mess with people's mental health. UGH.", "NTA, they unlawfully imprisoned you", "NTA\n\nThey literally put you in harm's way with a sadistic prank\n\nThey're lucky it was only a broken door.", "Since you're driving, it doesn't seem like you and your friends are 12. Get new friends. People who would do stuff like that are not friends.", "NTA. They are very lucky you weren't allergic on top of phobic! I've never cared for wasps, hornets, etc., and inadvertently got stung by a hornet just above a fingernail a couple years ago. Had what was called a \"large reaction,\" and within moments, a ring finger was swollen and purple, my arm was swollen to my bicep and I was stuffed up. My ex's wife took me to a fire station a couple blocks away, where they cut my ring off, and praised her for not taking me to the hospital (further away)l I got benadryl, used ice, and now am so leery!\n\nYour friend's aren't friends at all, they are cruel individuals. If they sue, which would be a civil matter, you have rebuttal - hopefully you have therapist receipts, etc.  You'd need to make a police report for any criminal charges to be filed and acted upon.", "NTA.    Fuck those guy. That ridiculous bully shit", "Let him take you to court, it'd be laughed out the door. They basically held you against your will and you could call the cips on them.", "NTA\n\nBut these people are not your friends.\nThey dont even seem to like you.\nYou deserve better", "NTA, make sure you get what happened documented in s text message with them confirming what they did to you in case you need that for small claims court. What they did could likely be considered assault and I bet you could press charges for it if things came to that.", "You are NTA.  People who mock phobias are AHs.  People who intentionally trigger phobias for laughs are Presidents of the AH Company.  \n\nYour so-called friends?  Who deliberately triggered you, confined you against your clearly expressed wishes, and now want you to *pay for the damage you did breaking out?*   They are the Great and Powerful AHs of Oz, may Deities take them and those who brought them. \n\nIt's obvious to everyone here that you are 100% in the *moral* right for refusing to pay for the door, but unfortunately that doesn't automatically mean you're in the *legal* right.  It'll depend on the legislation of your individual district, so you need to get legal advice.  Hopefully there's a government agency near you or something, that can do it cheaply.  Universities often offer free assistance.  \n\nMay you have good luck finding better friends.", "You should be the one suing them.", "NTA\nLet it go to small claims court. Get a psychological assessment detailing your phobia and counter sue all \"friends\" involved. And get new friends.", "File a police report against them to have it on record. They trapped you, refused to let you out and caused you intense distress. If he tries to sue, counter sue and you\u2019ll have this record", "NTA. What they did was monstrous. One of the first things I was taught in my mental health first aid course was that a person's fear FEELS REAL (no matter how seemingly irrational to others). Even if you were unlikely to be harmed (unless you have an allergy to the insects), they knew you would be terrified. This is emotional abuse.\n\nLet the assholes take you to SCC - you can countersue for emotional distress and see how it impacts upon their future career/relationship prospects.", "NTA. Get new friends. The guys who did that to you are clearly not your friends. Don't pay the money. If they truly go to court, you will easily win when you tell your side of the story.", "NTA, you will counter sue for false imprisonment and trauma. Those people are trash. I'm sorry they did this to you.", "NTA. Don\u2019t pay, and find new friends.", "nta", "NTA and I'd dare him to sue you. Ask him how far he thinks he'll get when it's revealed that he held you against your will and was warned multiple times.", "Never talk to these friends again OP. I wouldn\u2019t trust them at all not to seek vengeance and do something worse. File a report since they are threatening to sue. See if you can get them to acknowledge what they did via text so it\u2019s in writing. See if you can get names too of proof who was there. Have a consult with a lawyer so you know your options and risks.", "Nta", "Definitely NTA. Get new friends. Fear is not something to play around with. Doing shit like this has gotten people killed or injured. Your friends triggered your body's fight or flight mechanic which is your body's built-in survival mechanism. They say a creature is most dangerous when backed into a corner. What they did to you is the same. What you might call anxiety is your body preparing to give EVERYTHING to ensure your survival and if you have to kill then so be it. That is why it's stupid and dangerous to play these kinds of games.", "Tell him to go ahead. Bring documentation of your diagnosis. What they did was cruel, and possibly illegal, although don't quote me on that one. I'm not scared of too many bugs, BUT centipedes, millipedes, worms, caterpillars are a NO DEAL.

What if you are allergic? \n2. Wasps and bees are not the same and can cause 2 diffrent reactions\n3. It still freaking hurts\n4.they took it upon themselves to 'help' you out when you never asked for help and would not have lovked yourself on a porch. \n\nThen after the complaint, take them to judge judy and then find some better friends", "They locked you in a room with something you fear greatly.\n\nPerhaps you should have run the other way, and not broken glass, but rather the screen, but phobias don\u2019t always allow for rational behaviour. \n\nI hope you are alright.  Write a letter, explaining what happened, be detailed, send a copy to each \u2018friend\u2019. Explain the last copy will go to the police if Theo do not cease demands. You where held again your will.  You have a case against them. This should stop any further claim. \n\nNTA and don\u2019t see them again. They are dangerous.", "NTA. file a police report", "INFO: how did you break tempered glass with a piece of outdoor furniture? Or was the door not up to code? Why did you not go through the relatively cheap and flimsy screen?", "Nta - let them sue you and see how that turns out", "NTA. Who does that to a \"friend?\" I hate spiders. If someone has done that to me in an enclosed space full of spiders, I may have literally dropped dead, let alone smashed the glass. On top of that, you warned them. More than once. I wouldn't pay them one red cent.", "My god the naivety of your friend! Imagine taking this case before a judge. You were the victim of a crime. You can take him to court for this event. I\u2019m so sorry OP. I had a similar situation with spiders. I was not ok. I highly recommend getting CBT or other therapy to help you live your life without fear. Good luck OP. (Oh and these are not your friends- block them)", "I would only add that OP should consult a lawyer before any contact with police. ESPECIALLY since his \"friend\" is threatening court action. The wrong cop or tactic could cost him. Lawyers know how to navigate the process.", "Yup. Just go ahead and file charges of kidnapping and assault at least. OP's former friend was very well deserving of that consequence", "Difference in op s case is it's criminal to imprison someone which they did and your friend didn't. Op should file a police report on these ahs.\n\nYour friend while playing a crappy joke found out the hard way not to do it anymore and it seems accepted his/her responsibility in it\n\nAlso if op got stung and is allergic that's attempted murder. That is also something your friend didn't do.\n\nNTA OP", "I'd honestly still file a police report. You don't have to pursue charges necessarily. If your friend sues that police report is evidence you were being held against your will.", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to drop this group of friends. What may seem irrational or silly to them is obviously a very real fear to you.
