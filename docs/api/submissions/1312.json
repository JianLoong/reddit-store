Your wife is being petty and should just invite your mom\u2019s boyfriend (even though he sounds like an AH). You were an AH for telling your wife that your mom doesn\u2019t necessarily want to invite her but does. Were you trying to incite a bigger fight?", "NTA! Have the Thanksgiving somewhere else and leave your rude wife at home.", "NTA and this shouldn't even be a discussion.\n\nIf your potential guest has a spouse/SO and you're hosting an event, then they are invited as a couple or not at all. The fact that this is your own mother makes your wife's attitude about this even worse.", "NTA If your wife wants to host Thanksgiving then, she needs to be gracious enough to invite you mom\u2019s boyfriend. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s an obnoxious or hostile guest. If she doesn\u2019t invite your mom\u2019s bf then, she\u2019ll be creating a lot of division on a cherished family holiday. It would probably be the last Thanksgiving anyone will want her to host.", "NTA\n\nIt would be shitty to invite your mom without her partner. What happens if they get married? Will your wife keep inviting your mom without her husband?\n\nINFO:\n\n> mom will sometimes joke about it and stroke him \n\nWhat?", "NTA.  It sounds like hosting is a bad idea. You are only going to piss someone off by trying to decide who is worthy of an invite and who isn't.  For the sake of your marriage and your sanity, take this hosting Thanksgiving idea behind the barn and shoot it.", "NTA\n\nIf your wife refuses to invite John your mother will either host her own Thanksgiving or ask if anyone else is hosting Thanksgiving since she wont go to your wife's Thanksgiving. This will result in much drama and empty chairs at your wife's first Thanksgiving.", "Gentle YTA. Why would you say that to your wife if you don\u2019t have any actual proof and examples to give her? I get what you\u2019re trying to do but that is definitely not the way to do it.", "You're NTA. Is your wife trying to cause irreparable damage to your relationship with your mom? It would be very insulting to exclude her significant other from a holiday dinner. Let's face it, we all have at least one person in the extended family we wish we could exclude from events. But we have to suck it up and put up with them so we can maintain our relationships with the person they're attached to.", "NTA.  Part of hosting holidays is having people over that you would otherwise not invite.  I get the appeal of hosting, but not at the expense of family members.  It sounds like she is using hosting as an excuse to customize her holiday, and that is not fair.  Until recently, she was the girlfriend Invited to the holidays.  She needs to suck this one up and understand it comes with the territory of hosting.  She is literally asking your mother to choose between spending the holiday with her family or her boyfriend.  That is not fair to anyone and extremely selfish", ">John just **does not like people,** **can't be bothered to talk to anyon**e but my mom.\n\nI'm shocked he would even come to any event since he doesn't like people. \n\n> My mom will sometimes joke about it **and stroke him which is a bit weird**\n\nYeah that's weird and I can see how that might make someone uncomfortable\n\n>He once said the words \"I'm smart enough to make the money I want, and good looking enough to get the women I want, so **I have no motivation not to act like this.\"**\n\nSo John's a self aware asshole. \n\nI think this is ESH. You didn't have to throw it in your wife's face that your mom doesn't like her. That's like throwing fuel on the fire. You should be able to disagree with your wife and talk to her without insulting her.  She needs to accept that if she wants to be a host, then she might have to endure John's assholery.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife is the jerk here . Good job in humbling her!", "I\u2019m with OP, it seems pretty apples to apples. Mom understands how rude it is to not invite peoples partners, Daughter desperately wants to play this role, she should extend the same courtesy."]}
