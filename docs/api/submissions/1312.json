It's basic manners, of which nearly everyone agrees.", "Not asking you to justify your decision, just pointing out that you're doing exactly what OP is asking is wife to do, treat them as a social unit. He's okay with not inviting her at all, just not inviting *only* her.", "He cares about his partner and that's why he shows up. He's not the one causing any scene.", "You do, embrace the indifference", "You're not just calling her out though. You're forcing her to invite someone she's not comfortable with being around. That's going too far. It would have been better if you chose not to participate.", "When you host a gathering, you don't have to invite every relative of your relatives. MIL's partner is not wife's FIL. He's nobody to her. \n\nIf Op wants a say on the get together, he can host or co-host. He said his wife was hosting. He doesn't get to make the rules. It may be his house, too, but it's her event. Anyone who has a problem can decide not to participate, him included.", "I'm just pointing out it's her event and she has more of a right to be comfortable at it than the guests. Any of the guests can decline. It's an invitation, not a summons. \n\nI don't agree with forcing yourself to be around someone you don't want, especially in your own house, just to please someone else. I understand some people think it's  socially acceptable etiquette, but fuck that. I think it's outdated. I think that thinking is the reason why the creepy uncles keep getting invited to family gatherings. It's time to change that thinking.", "I'm just pointing out it's her event and she has more of a right to be comfortable at it than the guests. Any of the guests can decline.

I am giving her the option if she is truly serious about this to not invite any of my family, but if she doesn\u2019t invite him she\u2019s going to seriously hurt my relationship with my mom and grandparents", "Sorry, no. Some might regard it as outdated, but one cardinal rule of hosting is that guests' comfort comes first, even if that comes at some cost to the host. \n\nGranted, one need not take this to ridiculous extremes. But John isn't Charlie Manson redux. He's just extremely quiet, doesn't care for people besides MIL. I don't know how many people OP & wife plan to have over, but if there are enough he won't even be noticed. \n\nWhen all is said & done, no one's forcing OP's wife to play host. She can ensure her own comfort by not doing so. But since she has stepped up there are responsibilities inherent. I think OP's fear that an invitation from them specifying *only* MIL will put him needlessly afoul of his mother is well founded.", "She is being very shortsighted if she thinks she can just openly be an AH to your mom's SO. \n\nHow will she feel when she inevitably gets excluded from future gatherings with your family? Excluded from the wedding if your mom gets married? Excluded from family dinners etc etc etc. She is basically going to create a dynamic where it's going to be the BF or her. And, that is going to he a pretty easy decision for your mom and grandparents.", "You just said \"my\" house. That's the single guy talking again. If you live with your wife the house isn't just yours. Marriage isn't just a piece of paper. It's a mindset. I don't think you'd even be having this problem if you were more joined as husband and wife and if you two thought more as a unit.", "Ok it is our house but I don\u2019t ever want to think as a unit. That sounds like a cult. Also she has to understand that while we are a unit, so are my mom and John and she needs to have some empathy or at the very least just not invite my mom", "Periodt", "So you would choose your mom over your wife? If he makes your wife that uncomfortable, he doesn\u2019t need to be invited. My wife and I have to agree on all guests, solves the problem of having people either of us don\u2019t want, and we don\u2019t invite one of my brothers, his wife sounds like the boyfriend in this story.", "Almost TA.  I agree she needs to suck it up.  Part of the misery of having divorced parents is having to deal with the random annoying romantic partners they bring along\u2026 it\u2019s crap but it\u2019s how it is.  But you shouldn\u2019t have said your mom doesn\u2019t like her!", "I mean, turn on the football game and tell your wife to pretend he\u2019s watching it and then he\u2019s just like every other dude on Thanksgiving. And be glad he says nothing instead of ranting about litter boxes in schools or whatever fake bullshit weirdos will be mad about by next month. Not inviting someone\u2019s partner is unacceptable. NTA.", "John sounds like an ass, but there's no reason not to invite him if your mom is going to be invited. NTA.", "NTA \n\nJohn might be neurodivergent or maybe only severely shy or introverted.  The one-off comment he made could have been a botched attempt at humour or a defensive throwaway.\n\nIf he was loud and obnoxious, insulted or perved or stole, or some other \"red line\" behavior I would have said maybe,  but it's one person in a crowd that bothers no-one.\n\nPresumably also, with your mom, he has contributed (if only financially or agreeing to give up his space that day) to hosting you guys in the past.  \n\nHow far is your wife willing to take this cuz it then becomes fair game next time your mom hosts to NOT invite your wife if she's made so uncomfortable by her partner...!!", "NTA, no doubt John sounds like a weird dude, but that's not really a good enough reason not to invite him.\n\nYes, she should suck it up and invite him.", "NTA. Your wife is very rude OP.", "NTA. When you host a holiday, you don't pick and choose. I'm hosting Thanksgiving this year, and am not that fond of my SIL, but she's invited with my brother and his family, and she will be treated as all my other guests will be treated. If your wife does this, she will run the risk of quid pro quo in the form of she's not invited to stuff and you are, and you will most likely have a Thanksgiving that does not include your family members at your table this year. My suggestion: Put your foot down on this and tell her it is also your house, also your Thanksgiving, and also HER family and if she is not including your mother's SO, there will be no Thanksgiving at your house you will be attending. She is being disrespectful to you and I'm telling you now, if your wife does this, it is going to make life very difficult for you down the road. Marriage is about compromise, and your wife needs to learn that. Time for her to grow up.\n\nOn a side note, I have an Autistic child, and some of the SO's behavior sounds like he may fall on the spectrum at a high functioning or even Asperger's level. Not that it matters, just me being curious.", "NTA \n\nYour wife is being rude. The guy doesn't sound like my cup of tea, but he hasn't done anything to warrant being excluded.", "I'm going against the grain here and saying YTA, but hear me out. Your wife said that he makes her uncomfortable and that's what should take priority. If I was uncomfortable around a person enough that I don't want them in my home, my husband would respect that. Your wife should come first. You don't know if there's something deeper going on. Maybe talk with your wife to see if something else about him bothers her. \n\nAlso, total dick move telling your wife that your mom doesn't always want to invite her. I would be so self-conscious that I wouldn't be able to be around her again. Hopefully,  your wife is more understanding and can look past that, but don't be surprised if pushing this and finding that out leads to some major problems in your future.", "The first time hosting will also be her last if she goes through with this. What is she thinking?", "I wonder why she thinks it's different that she's always gotten an invite even though her and her MIL have nothing in common... and I'll hazard a guess and say her next argument will be no ring, no bring. \n\nOP this should totally be a hill to die on. If she can't extend an invite to your mother's boyfriend,  then she shouldn't be hosting family gatherings. I guarantee if you don't nip this in the bud you'll end up with a lifetime of difficult holidays and strained relationships. Your mother could decide to stop inviting her and say SHE makes John uncomfortable. What then? Fix it and fix it now.", "I don\u2019t see anyone saying he\u2019s a great guest, not sure what comments you\u2019re reading. He\u2019s not a terrible guest either though, just a very quiet one. Nothing that makes him an asshole, or that would justify not inviting him along with OP\u2019s mother.", "So you're going to be completely detached from Thanksgiving? You don't care enough to be involved with the event planning? This is honestly really strange to hear.", "Because some extroverts don\u2019t actually understand introverts. Especially if they\u2019re uncomfortable with being by themselves.", "If he doesn\u2019t talk to people at work either it sounds like he\u2019s just extremely introverted. Not a bad guest in my opinion. \n\nIt\u2019s the same behavior you would see in someone showing up really high to an event\u2026 quiet asf, whispering to their friend once in a while and eating food.", "That's not what introvert is that's socially anxious person. Introverts are those that are just typically quiet by nature and not outgoing"]}
