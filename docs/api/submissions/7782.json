She recently went out with her friends and bought short shorts that she thought were fine to wear since she is growing older. These shorts are borderline non-existent, meaning they are basically underwear from how short they are. She was going to the bus stop wearing them along with a skin tight sleeveless tshirt this morning when I saw her and stopped her, asking where the hell she thought she was going dressed up like that. She said it was the new style at school and all her friends were dressed that way and that it was comfortable instead of jeans. I told her I do not allow her to go to school dressed like that and tried to explain that it is showing too much skin and she told me that if she doesn\u2019t dress like that she\u2019ll look like a loser. I told her I\u2019m not changing my mind and to go wear sweatpants if she wants comfort to which she claimed it was abuse and threatened to tell her principal I am abusing her psychologically. I grounded her for a week and she ended up going to school wearing sweatpants and was crying when she left and came home. My wife thinks I wasn\u2019t understanding and that grounding her is taking it too far. So to all you redditors, AITA?\n\nEdit: To add to the post, her friends all get regular warnings from school about the way they are dressing and their parents try to stop them from dressing the way they are but they sneak clothes in their backpacks. Also, as mentioned above, it is basically underwear.

I know that a lot of schools have relaxed their dress codes, but I am fairly sure just about every school would ding exposed undergarments coming out of the bottom as an infraction.

That's definitely a grounding offense. Also, I am not sure where you live, but in the northern hemisphere, it's too cold for that attire anyway!

Besides, as others have said, I assume she would get dress-coded and made to change. Does her school have a handbook that they give out at the beginning of every school year? It should tell you the acceptable length for shorts. \nSecond, I say esh because I think grounding her might have been a bit harsh since she wore the sweatpants (also maybe a bit overboard - why not just have her change into something else she's comfortable in?) and came home with them on then she did what you asked her to.

You\u2019re obviously going to win an argument about what she wears, so no need to turn it into a full-blown screaming match. You said what you said, and you\u2019re not going to fight about it.
