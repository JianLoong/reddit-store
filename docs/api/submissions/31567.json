If you're thinking of 40 year olds as \"grannies\", you are probably way too young for her hitting on you to be appropriate regardless, but touching someone without their consent is *never* okay.

She\u2019s embarrassed to be called out and she\u2019s putting her frustration on you. \n\nI had this happen a lot when I worked at a bar.

Maybe it's better if you report this to someone who can help you. Also you shouldn't feel bad nor apologize about it. You have the rights with your own body and being touched without consent is awful.   \n\n\nkeep up the routine for the hair though make sure it still looks healthy!!", "NTA It's critical to establish boundaries and put your comfort above the inappropriate actions of others.

She\u2019s just mad because her feelings are hurt.\n\nThe only thing I would add is maybe consider getting more comfortable with immediate cues.  Definitely not something you have to do!! \n\nJust for your own comfort if you don\u2019t like having your hair touched, in the future you may consider stepping away right away when people touch your hair.  Totally up to you, you have the right to say no at any time!", "NTA.  No one should be touching anyone without their permission.

End of. I also have remarkable hair that strangers felt compelled to touch until I hit some magical age that apparently signals that I deserve personal space. \n\nThis woman behaved badly. You called her on it, and now she\u2019s embarrassed. Rather than apologizing to you, she\u2019s treating you like the bad guy. \n\nStill, you did nothing wrong.

Never feel bad about setting any kind of boundaries. I have curly hair and people always want to touch it, but if they touch it it\u2019ll  get frizzy. And also I don\u2019t want randos touching my hair in the elevator or anywhere else. Keep setting those boundaries", "Oh hell no, don\u2019t apologize.  Next time you see her, and are alone in the elevator, and there is no camera in the elevator, run  your fingers through her hair and mess it up real good, maybe have something sticky on your hands too.
