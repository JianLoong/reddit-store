If you're thinking of 40 year olds as \"grannies\", you are probably way too young for her hitting on you to be appropriate regardless, but touching someone without their consent is *never* okay.

Maybe it's better if you report this to someone who can help you. Also you shouldn't feel bad nor apologize about it.

Definitely not something you have to do!! \n\nJust for your own comfort if you don\u2019t like having your hair touched, in the future you may consider stepping away right away when people touch your hair.

Never feel bad about setting any kind of boundaries. I have curly hair and people always want to touch it, but if they touch it it\u2019ll  get frizzy.

Next time you see her, and are alone in the elevator, and there is no camera in the elevator, run  your fingers through her hair and mess it up real good, maybe have something sticky on your hands too.
