Second, if you read my comment, all I said was that many women do become grandmothers in their 40s. There was no judgement on my part, let alone crass judgement. Third, nothing in my comment mentioned that I wasn't accepting of anyone's age, nor have I said anything that needs me to \"mellow out\". You've either confused me with someone else, or you replied to the wrong comment. Word of advice, I would leave off your last line if you don't know someone. I'm 25 and my doctor (last time I had one) said he doesn't expect me to live to be 40. And that was when I had medical insurance. I'll be lucky to hit 30 without medical help."]}
