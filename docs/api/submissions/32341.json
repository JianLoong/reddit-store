It was a normal talk, we talked about life and everything. We are not like best friends, we never had any argument, we were just calmly talking and I never had a feeling that she thinks of me badly.\nAs out talking progressed she suddenly told me that her son wants to propose to me and he talked with her. I didn't even know that he wanted propose so it was a surprise. I asked asked her is that true and maybe he wanted to keep that a secret. She said that it was okay, but she wouldn't want to see us getting married. This caught me off guard so I asked her what does she mean by that. And without any hesitation and with a smile on her face she said \"Oh I think my son can do better and find someone who is his match.\" My jaw dropped, I looked at her like a deer in headlights, so she quickly started to say \"oh but you are great too, it's okay if you stay together.\" This pissed me off even more and I started to argue with her, I was saying that she is crazy for thinking that, how dare she. And after some time I just said that she needs to leave and she did, but before leaving she said \"I was right about you from the start, my son is making a mistake.\" And left. \nI was so mad that I was even shaking, we never argued with her and I thought we had an ok relationship, but she decided to say that.\nAfter some time I got a call from my boyfriend grandma (his mothers mother) about how dare I to do this and why I was like this.

But you'd better sit your boyfriend down right quick and talk to him about it. If his mother wants to be a big part of his life, he needs to be solid on his dedication to you. If you marry the man, you marry the family, so he needs to decide fast if he is solidly on your side, or if he's wavering like a mama's boy.\n\n\nI left a man because his father straight up told me that I was \"not what he envisioned\" for his son (interracial relationship). Boyfriend was always seeking his papa's approval, so I knew there would never be any peace, and any brown babies would be shunned.", "NTA. Have you talked with your bf already? He should be pissed with her. Not only she said those awful things to you, in your house, but even spoiled the surprise.", "NTA.  Kicking her out would have been my first move after she said it, not to argue with her.  Second move would be to tell the boyfriend.  I hope he put a stop to it.  I would go absolutely nuclear on my mother and grandmother had they done something like this.", "NTA. Your bf needs to have a discussion with his mother and grandmother after he gets home this evening and talks to you first. You shouldn\u2019t take calls from them in the meantime.", "Lord, NTA.  I mean, she doesn't live there, it was just a visit, and to disrespect you in that house that you live in, that is so awful.  She was unkind.  I don't know if it was an overreaction or not.", "Stop taking calls from his family and have a long sit-down discussion with your BF.  NTA", "NTA I immediately got a feeling that his mother wanted to elicit anger and a negative reaction from you so that she could then go to her son and say \u201clook how badly your GF has treated me???\u201d All in an attempt to stop a proposal. If so, BF needs to 100% on your side and call his mother out on this as well as be willing to block future attempts.", "NTA good you kicked her ass out. You were too nice imo, I would of screamed at her, especially if it\u2019s in my own home?! Lol\nYou need to talk to your boyfriend because his mother is probably jealous of you and seeing that your boyfriend wants to propose, she\u2019s now scared you\u2019ll be put first in his life (As you should be). Smh mothers like this need their own life and own relationship. Can\u2019t stand when mothers get in the way of their son\u2019s relationships, like why cant they simply be happy for their sons?", "She was trying to hurt you? She had to be? Who on earth thinks that saying something like that to ANYONE will be well received? \n\nAt any rate its game on with grandma. You are not people who care for or respect each other. And she can stop being a guest in your home. Period. \"I don't like you. You don't like me. We are not pals. And I don't want you here. End of song lady.\"\n\n Your BF must be out of his mind expecting you to tolerate ill treatment in your own home to keep peace with his wretched relatives? \n\nNTA.", "It sounds like you just asked her to leave, not that you \"kicked her out.\" And that was a discussion, not an argument.\n\nNAH. The phrase \"find someone is his match\" kind of sounds like there might be some cultural expectations in play here...?\n\nYour boyfriend's mother is tactless, but she apparently felt it was important to tell you where she stands on the relationship. She gave her opinion without any personal attacks, and she left when you asked her to.  \n\nShe's done you a favor here, by giving you all the information you need to decide whether you want to join this family. Think about all that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

This is a crucial point in your relationship. If your bf/fiance won't stand up to her for you this is going to be a nightmare. He needs to have your back 100% and basically tell her if she can't accept you then he will not have her in his life until she does. Also, no comment jabs or nice/nasty talking to you. I wouldn't accept anything but her being a normal nice person (lol, I know) THAT is what needs to happen to salvage this. BTW, you're better than me cause I probably would have gone low with w/e I knew about her but then again I'm not into confrontation so I probably would never but in my head I would. Lol. Good luck and update us!!", "NTA, but (no judgment) you handled it badly.  She baited the trap and you walked right into it.  Now she gets to go around to all her relatives and say how horrible you are for kicking her out of the house.  And you can bet that she is lying about what she said so you are coming off as just more bat shit crazy.  Notice how quickly she got GM on the phone.\n\nNot that I would have done better in your shoes and at your age.\n\nBet the whole story about proposing was made up too so that when you ask BF about it, you'll sound crazy to him.\n\nSorry this happened to you.  Better have a chat with BF and make sure you are on the same page.  And don't have any conversations with her by yourself.  And if you do have to, then just nod your head, smile, and let her know that it's nice that she has an opinion.  Or wait until your BF is coming back into the room and exclaim \"well!  I can't believe your husband let you do that.  So trusting.  Hi, honey!  What?  Oh, nothing.  Girl talk.\"", "Oh hell no. I would have kicked her out as well.

I just had to see from other perspective, maybe I didn't overreact, because it just happened and I'm still mad like a dog", "I don't know, I never got the sense that she is mad or jealous. She was chill all the time, but now she decided to lash out. Never thought of her in that way, was hoping to be friends with her.", "Well we argued back and forth, I was mad but I didn't scream at her. When I understood that she will not be respecting me I asked her to leave now, not in the best tone, I was saying that through my teeth, because I was mad.\nBut for me it's not important what she thinks about me, I don't care, I'm just scared that my boyfriend will take her side, but we had a call and will talked about this tonight when he comes home from work. But he said that he is already on my side. But it hurt that she just casually said that he's son can find someone better, so it probably turns out I do care what others think...", "There you go.
