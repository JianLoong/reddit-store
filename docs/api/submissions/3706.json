And it wasn\u2019t easy and that\u2019s why he moved out the first opportunity he got. \n\nIn the time he was away, he visited them a grand total of 3 times. They never called unless he called. They never wrote letters unless he wrote first. Now living about 3 hours from them, they never see him or our children unless we go to them. His 4 brothers still live at home. The eldest one, has no job, but there\u2019s no pressure as he is in college. The thing is, he keeps changing his major. Dropping classes left and right. Taking only 1 or 2 classes per semester. No finish in sight. He randomly messaged my husband to let him know he wants to move out and if he could stay in our spare bedroom. No hello, no how are you, no nothing. The first messages he\u2019s received from him in roughly 6 months. This goes for his entire family. They don\u2019t care to see us or call us unless it\u2019s us reaching out. However!! Whenever they need something, a new tv, a new fridge, a new anything! They\u2019re quick to call. Lost cellphone, lost school text book, anything you can think of. Anytime I see the phone ring and see it\u2019s his family, I know money will be involved. I\u2019d like it to be noted that we are NOT rich. We are NOT well off. We work paycheck to paycheck. So anytime they need money, it\u2019s us scraping together the little extra we have to give it. It\u2019s caused issues before and I\u2019ve had to put my foot down and we no longer give any. (Unless it\u2019s an emergency and medically related) His brother has no car, no job, he is in still in school, but again, I think at this point it\u2019s an excuse to not work and \u201cfocus\u201d on his studies. \nI said no to him moving in, my husband said we have a spare room so why not\u2026 i feel like they use my husband for their own benefit. And him moving in, would have no move out date in sight. It would be an extra mouth to feed. If it was an emergency again, I wouldn\u2019t even think about it. But this is just on a whim of wanting to leave home just for the hell of it. Unfortunately, since my husband was never shown that type of love from his family, he thinks by helping with money, it\u2019s showing love. That they do look for him and need him as a part of their family. It breaks my heart, and I hate seeing him being taken advantage of. This particular moving in issue  hasn\u2019t caused an argument between my husband and I yet, but it\u2019s heading that way\u2026 AITA!?!?", "created_utc": 1669921971, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9wopo/aita_for_not_letting_my_husbands_brother_move_in/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not a fan of ultimatums, but they do have their place and this is one. Tell him if brother moves in, you\u2019re moving out. And do it. If it goes that far, it won\u2019t take hubby long to realize the error of his ways. How easy you go on him is up to you. Good luck with everything.", "NTA. forget those people but your husband needs therapy. Would work wonders! Best of luck.", "NTA. Your husband, in his search for family, is happy to be their doormat. He doesn\u2019t have any obligation to be that, but you have even less of an obligation. It\u2019s your house too.\n\nAlso, this guy will never move out and I\u2019d be surprised if he ever helps out around the house if you do let him move in. Sounds like a total freeloader", "NTA. They are actively taking advantage of your husband's generosity. Having the brother just move in as an added financial burden is unacceptable.\n\nAnd once he's there, dislodged him could require formal eviction depending how long he stayed. You have the right to put your foot down", "NTA. They are using your husband and in his desperation to be loved by his family he is giving in. You are hurting your family to continue helping them. This cannot be a unilateral decision, but one you make together, but also a \"2 yes, 1 no\" situation.", "NTA, they're manipulating him with that \"bUt FaMiLy\" b.s.", "NTA- To your husband- I am done being a doormat for your entitled family. I absolutely am not going to have someone living in my home who has done nothing to earn any sign of trust, work ethic or respect to us. \n\nWhen they reach out to you because they want to see you or be with you or honor you- you can think other wise but all they see us as is an ATM. I will make no sacrifices for them and especially not my privacy or security in my home. I simply will not live with the disrespect that comes with him.", "NTA  \nYour husband's family are manipulating him into trying to buy their love and affection. The reality is, they don't actually care about him, they just see him as a resource to be exploited.\n\nHis brother just wants to leech off you and if he establishes any kind of tenant's rights, you will never get rid of him.\n\nYou can tell your husband that he may not feel able to say \"No\" to his family but that you can and that it is you home as well as his.  For anyone to stay in your home would require approval from both you and your husband but in this case, his brother's stay does not have your approval.", "Thanks everyone!! For those wondering his age, he\u2019s 21 years old. I\u2019m sure overtime, it\u2019ll turn into him needing to borrow the car to go out as well and with no job, that would mean gas money too. I think it\u2019s time I just go to him directly and tell him no myself. It may lead to an argument with my husband but In the end, it\u2019s to protect him from his family!", "NTA - Your husband needs a spine.  The last thing you need is to have this freeloader sucking the life out of you and your marriage.  It is time to take a stand.  Tell husband NO!  Helping with money shows he is a sucker.  They will not be thankful or love him in return.  They see him as a sucker to be used and discarded.  Remind him that there is a reason he did not live with them for long.", "NTA. Once he\u2019s in, he\u2019ll never leave. You will be forever at the mercy of these leeches.", "NTA.  \n\nYou said. \". We are NOT well off. We work paycheck to paycheck.\"\n\"His brother has no car, no job, he is in still in school, but again, I think at this point it\u2019s an excuse to not work and \u201cfocus\u201d on his studies\"\n\nYou and your husband can barely support yourselves.  You are not in a position to take on another adult to feed, clothe,and shelter, especially with him having no job and end date in sight. You didnt mention the age of the brother, but regardless it would put too much pressure on you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur husband is an AH. People moving in need two yeses, he has ONE NO.", "NTA.  The brother is looking for yet another free ride.  You'll be financially responsible for him.  He will contribute nothing and most likely he'll just cause a total upheaval in your house.

It is another person you do not know well injecting themselves into your personal space and adding their opinion into your marriage, thoughts and feelings. They can make a terrible mess causing more work. They can be verbally and emotionally abusive and disrespectful. They could steal from you, bring drugs into the house or partners back for casual sex. They could keep you awake at night, leave doors unlocked. Get drunk and party. They will be eating your food, using your utilities and raising bills, they might even use your car, cause damage and use up all your gas. This is far from, 'just a room.' Tell him if he moves in, you will be moving out.", "An ultimatum is appropriate here.  \n\nTell your husband that he and his brother will both be homeless if brother moves in, because you will move out the day he moves in.
