We were very very close in school, but started distancing in college. Tia is a really sweet person and generally well liked.\n\nWhenever we would make plans (just the two of us or others) I\u2019d end up paying her share too. She always told me that she\u2019d pay somewhere else or pay me later, but rarely did. Even if we went to her home, she\u2019d want everyone to contribute to delivered food, but never offered the same at someone else\u2019s place. My family was better off so I never thought about it in school.\n\nWe went to different but nearby colleges, so we\u2019d still meet up sometimes for movies, lunches, events, etc. I always paid for the tickets and she would say she\u2019d pay for food, but would never get any. It felt awkward to ask her for money, so I\u2019d just get my own. Sometimes, after weeks, she\u2019d pay me her share of the tickets. If we went to a restaurant she\u2019d say that she\u2019ll transfer the money but would do it weeks later or mostly forget altogether.\n\nRecently, whenever we\u2019d make plans, she comes and says that she\u2019s not hungry. Well whatever, I\u2019d order anyway, then she would just eat off my plate while I\u2019m awkwardly smiling. Since she didn\u2019t place the order, she never felt the need to pay despite the fact that she ate my food. \n\nA few weeks back I met her with some other friends and she said she couldn\u2019t eat outside food/non-bland food since she would get sick. The rest of us ordered Mexican food while she got a drink. She proceeded to eat the spicy food we added and even took the food one of my friends didn\u2019t want to eat. Someone asked her if that won\u2019t affect her health, and she just laughed it off. When the bill came, I asked if everyone wanted to split it item wise or equally. To my pleasant surprise, Tia agreed to the latter. She wanted to transfer the money electronically later so I paid her share. That same day she confirmed my account details. It has been weeks, she has not paid me back and has ignored my texts (not related to payment).\n\nShe had some mental health issues and she was a close friend of mine, so I\u2019m worried about a falling out from something so petty. She is well liked amongst my school peers and if push comes to shove, they\u2019d pick her in a heartbeat (I\u2019m just not a social butterfly, but don\u2019t want to be ostracised either). It\u2019s not about the money to me, just the principle of it. Tia could just come & hang out if she doesn\u2019t want to pay, but it annoys me that she eats everyone else\u2019s food and doesn\u2019t pay.\n\nSo WIBTA to ask her to start paying for herself?

It's likely she's taking advantage of you (and others) because you're too nice to confront her about her poor behaviour.\n\nThere's nothing more reasonable than asking someone to pay their fair share. The reason you think you could be an asshole is because you have been paying for her for so long, it's become normal, and you feel like you're taking something away from her. Something that she is essentially stealing from you. \n\nIn fact, it's not even a request. You can declare that you will only pay for your things.", "NTA. \nNext time she does it, just say you\u2019re trying to watch what you spend and only budgeted enough money for your meal.

We\u2019re college students which means we\u2019re not loaded with money (usually) so if Tia had consideration for you she would keep that in mind. It can happen, like sometimes with friends if my friend covers something then I cover the next thing, and so forth but she hasn\u2019t done that like you said which just means you\u2019ve been paying for everything. You need to set boundaries or else it\u2019s going to keep giving the message that you\u2019re content and okay with her using you, even if you don\u2019t think that. \n\nAnd to be honest, even if she is \u201cwell liked\u201d, I bet you there\u2019s mutual friends who probably already think like you do and are annoyed with this, but are also keeping a good face for the sake of social harmony. It\u2019s all BS and you deserve your money back. Keep grilling her for it (it doesn\u2019t have to be super aggressive!) and in the end, she\u2019s probably not a good friend to keep if she keeps doing this.

Mental Health issues are not an excuse for that.", "NTA\n\nFriendships are meant to be balanced. This is not. Unfortunately money is a big barrier in these situations for people.

You might think you're being nice but actually you are being taken advantage of. \n\nPersonally, I would cut my losses with the money you've already spent on her.

Restaurants can split things up. At some point this is partially on you because you keep doing it.", "NTA - There is typically some give and take with money in a friendship that might even balance more toward one person vs. another.  This isn't that.  This is a person who wants to freeload on you and is even coming up with creative ways to manage the situation which tells me that she knows what she is doing.  You need to cut her off.  It might get somewhat awkward if you have to do it with others present, but I suggest you try and get as creative as she is in getting her to carry her own weight.", "Either she's a mooch and then you're definitely NTA or she could have mental health issues or she's got no money and is literally starving.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t need to be a hardship on you, she is taking advantage of you and that\u2019s that. There is no reason to have to remember it later, she can yank out her phone and Venmo or Zelle right then and there. Her mental health is not an excuse. If this causes a falling out, that is on her and not you! You need to stand up for yourself - in a polite matter of fact way - but do it!", "I was that friend for a while but when I started working and busting ass I paid for things and paid back. Now I have become the go-to for some people and I have to say no or just cut my losses. I know for some people I will never see money again I haven\u2019t burned the bridge but I have have closed the bank", "NTA. There was another post here recently with the same problem. One time, I'd forgive it. Not every time, though; after once if I didn't get repaid, I'd no longer have meals with this person. This is what she is: a mooch. If she's in a worse financial position than you are, then she needs to cut down on her meals outside the house. This isn't a petty reason to let a friendship cool. She's taking advantage of you.", "In the next outing and the next and the next.. i would just say to her when she says she will trasnsfer you, that you only have enough for you.  She will prob go to another friend, until everyone realizes what shes doing and maybe either talk with her or just stop inviting her to things.", "NTA. Turn the table on her - tell her that you forgot your wallet or whatever and ask her to pay and you\u2019ll transfer the money later, and casually mention that you\u2019ve paid for her a lot in the past.\n\nIt sounds to me as if she\u2019s just poor, which is fine obviously. But if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not cool to leech off of you and claim that she\u2019ll repay you later without actually doing so.

Better make sure your hand stays away from my food in case it happens again\".\n\nIf any of your school friends want to pick her over you then do you really want to be \"friends\" with them?

Grow a backbone already.", "You are the TA - Having mental health issues is not an excuse for being a freeloader. You enable her, fall for it every time and then whine on this sub.

It\u2019s not a good look and will hurt you throughout life.", "NTA\n\nFriend, you need to put some boundaries. She can't keep on using your money if she's not paying back. \n\nWhat I have done in this situations is to start making light comments, like \"Hey, I thought you weren't hungry?\" or \"Haha get your own food haha\" , and if it doesn't work then it is time to confront her. If she really is your friend, she will keep being your friend even if you don't pay.", "Nta. Unless her behavior changes it would be smart to distance yourself from her. It seems like a one way friendship & clearly it's making you uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nBut I think it's futile to try and communicate it to her. She is a very masterful leech at this point.\n\nFrom this point on, avoid going out with her places where you have to pay, invite her to hang out in your room, or do picknick, find free events. When you are in a group setting, never offer to pay for her again. If she asks, tell her that you're on a budget/trying to be more responsible with your money. You can't protect others, annoying it may be, so try to protect yourself. If you stop taking care of her, someone else will.", "NTA. Learn the word \"No\" and use it.", "NTA\n\nI don't think you are going to get back any of the money Tia owes you, so I wouldn't waste my time asking. Tia knows exactly what she is doing. She is a cheap mooch who is used to \"forgetting her wallet\" and \"not being hungry\" to get out of paying herself.\n\nWhat you **can** do is stop yourself from being taken advantage of going forward by setting firm boundaries. You don't even need to call out her behavior (which will rebound on your friend group most likely.) Simply don't pay for her, not even a penny, not even once. Don't go to restaurants with just the two of you where it's a sit down place and the check comes at the end where she can \"forget\" her wallet. If the whole group is going there, fine, but your excuse is that you \"can't\" spot her this time. Someone else will have to, or she will have to pay herself. Choose places where you order your food and pay for your meals before eating. Don't order an appetizer for the table. Order your own plate and eat it.\n\nPractice these phrases, delivered kindly with a smile:\n\n\"Sorry, I can't spot you this time.\"\n\n\"Let's each get our own tickets.\" ... no, I'm sorry, I can't get yours this time.\n\n\"Sorry, but I'm planning to take my leftovers home and have them for lunch tomorrow. Are you hungry? Why don't you go to the counter and order yourself something?\" (do this the first time she tries to take so much as a french fry off your plate)\n\nAssume with Tia you will never see a cent back that you \"lend\" her so stop spotting her money, stop splitting things, stop covering things, stop saying one person gets the tickets and another gets the meal. She knows how to con things like that. Each of you pays your own way when you go out on everything. Period.", "Is she having money problems and is maybe embarrassed? Maybe she's not able to pay at that particular time. I agree that she should mention if she can't afford it at the time.", "NTA and stop paying for her.  Let her know upfront you won't be paying for her and anything you need to purchase ahead of time has to be paid upfront or no deal.  It's the only way to nip this in the bud.  Then also do not allow her to eat from your food or appetizers.  If she wants to share in the appetizers, then she needs to buy one of them for the group and pay for it herself.\n\nThese mooches rarely ever stop until you make it stop.  Most of the time, they will stop being your friend and will then move onto the next group of people to mooch off of while bad mouthing you and the others for stopping her from freeloading.  Be ready for it and don't let it get to you.  It doesn't matter who has more money or not.  On rare occasion, if you want to treat someone, make it clear up front that its for a special or rare occasion (ex. a birthday) and that's it.  Otherwise, everyone pays up at the time payment needed.  If she can't afford it or doesn't have her wallet, then let her settle it with the restaurant on her own.", "NTA, your \"friend\" sees you as a personal ATM which means she is not really being a friend to you.
