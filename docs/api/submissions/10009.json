If your parents and other relatives want to visit him, they can.", "Look, NTA. Nobody can make you spend time with your grandpa. It\u2019s a messed up situation and it was super unfair to you.

There's no obligation for you to forget years of poor treatment.", "NTA\n\nYou've already grieved the loss of your grandfather.  He never treated you like his grandkid and you're done.  You don't even have to be sad.\n\nYour mom wants you to visit him to make her own guilt less.  She knows he treated you appallingly and it will make her feel better if you forgive him.  You don't have to.\n\nYour grandmother enabled his behaviour and tried to justify it by telling you what she told you to make herself feel better.  If your grandfather really loved you, he wouldn't have treated you like that.  It may be believable if he treated each of his grandkids like he treated you but he didn't.\n\nNot every sick person who is an arse wants to make amends.\n\nThere would be some merit in going to see him and telling him what you really think of him and his arse behaviour with how he treated you.  But it's not always the best thing to do.\n\nI would not be going to see him if you don't want to.  Don't let anyone guilt you into it.  Your grand father showed you what he thought of you and you don't owe him anything.\n\nDo you have any idea why he treated you like he did.  Was there any history that you know about?  Are you a male?  If you are, does he just not like boys and prefers girls?", "I'll be honest, you should go visit, just to support your grandmother and at the very least if he sees you there, even if doesn't say something he at least saw that you showed up because you do care. \n\nYou care enough to post here to ask strangers, and you are being bothered still by feelings that if you didn't care, you wouldn't be bothered by them cause you wouldn't have them, thus you wouldn't be posting here right? \n\nNTA for your feelings they are valid but he's going to pass soon and you should try to have some empathy and compassion for your family and grandmother and even for him (cause he's suffering right now).", "TA, I have found that many things that happen when we were kids were always misinterpreted differently by us so I would confront him just in case it\u2019s all in your head. If it is all in your head, then you have peace when/if he dies that he doesn\u2019t hate you. If it\u2019s not in your head and he actually dislikes you then it sounds like you won\u2019t have to worry about it for long..", "This, if you have a good relationship with your grandmother go see her as she is about to lose her life partner.\n\nShe might appreciate the visit even if he doesn't.", "If the grandfather wants to reconcile\u2026 he can reach out. \n\nUntil then, nothing has changed.\n\n NTA- the grandfather was emotionally abusive and your parents saw it and did nothing to stop it. They were enabling it.", "There's a chance he won't be sorry though and that it could be super traumatic for OP if he starts being unpleasant to her from his deathbed.", "I was in a similar situation with one of my grandfathers- I think you\u2019re misreading the OP, i think he feels guilty for not being hurt, and questioning if something is wrong because it\u2019s no \nMore impactful than any other stranger having cancer. Which really shouldn\u2019t be the case\u2026 they\u2019re your grandparents- or the guy was supposed to be. \n\nWhich was my experience. All sorts of questions, self doubt, even loathing. I didn\u2019t know him, didn\u2019t care to know him and frankly\u2026 he didn\u2019t care to know me. \n\nThere was no reconciliation, and it\u2019s okay because as far as my life was concerned\u2026 there was nothing positive there. \n\nTen years running, it\u2019s just a fact of his life. Maybe I\u2019m misreading OP, too, but yeah, if my read is right there\u2019s nothing wrong with it.\n\n\n\nStill if your relationship with your grandmother is alright, OP, definitely support her.  But if it\u2019s not, you owe no one."]}
