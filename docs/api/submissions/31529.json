Or does the sister want to rotate the holiday too?", "It works well for *you*.", "Correct. I'm calling you selfish.", "I would never ask him to give up Christmas Eve, or rotate it. We also see his family Christmas Day for brunch. His family doesn\u2019t do anything for Christmas Day dinner so nothing to miss there. I\u2019m not selfish, and again, I hope you\u2019re okay.", "We would spend the whole time with one family. They do it twice but Thursday is the Thanksgiving celebration, Saturday is just the day that his whole family is there (his sister arrives, we arrive). His sister isn\u2019t changing her plans, she has the same line up that we currently do and it works really well for them. Also, wouldn\u2019t make sense for us to go to my parents on Saturday as that\u2019s typically the day my west coast family flies home", "On actual Thanksgiving, it would be his parents, brother, sister IL, their kids, his grandmother", "No, the family. We both get to attend the big holiday events for each family! Christmas Eve is a big deal for his family, with Santa making an appearance, and we go every year. He\u2019s not open to missing that\u2026 so why can\u2019t we leave well enough alone?", "And yet you say he\u2019s unwilling to give it up. How do you know if you haven\u2019t suggested it?", "Ok that makes more sense why he wants to go.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m with you\u2026\u2026.growing up we always did Thanksgiving with one side and Christmas with the other and it worked really well. It sounds like the sister also thinks it works well, so you aren\u2019t the only one missing the Thursday celebration and considering Christmas Eve is a huge deal it makes sense to do your set up.\n\nI do think it\u2019s super hypocritical that he wouldn\u2019t be willing to miss Christmas Eve every other year but wants you to miss your family\u2019s big celebration every other year.\n\nGood luck reasoning with him. I hope he sees your side or you can work out another compromise that works for both of you", "I asked him in response to rotating Christmas and he said no.", "In previous post, I meant I would never WANT him to miss Christmas Eve.. like I\u2019d never dream of actually skipping it. I asked him hypothetically if we rotated TGivs, would we rotate Xmas Eve? He said no.", "He\u2019s selfish. He refuses to give up his family holiday but insists you give you yours? No way."]}
