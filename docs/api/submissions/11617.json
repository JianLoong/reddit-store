After the tub, I put her to bed, which she fussed and screamed and was laying on the floor saying she wanted to play. I told her i was going to go get her a cup of water, and by the time I got back I expected her to be in bed, ready to be tucked in. If not, she\u2019s not going to the park. Well I came back and she wasn\u2019t so I told her No more park. Which was also hell for me to pay.\n\nI broke the news to my mil and she was angry. She said I was being unreasonable for a 4 year old, and that I had already told her yes, it was her last day with us. I stuck my ground and she went to the guest room for most the night, then later complaining to my husband and trying to get him to change my mom.

You don't want to clean up your toys? OK ill clean them and they'll go on top of the big dresser / mommy's room/ somwhere unavailable for a day because you didn't clean them. Splashing at bath? OK let's drain the water and we will clean you with just shower today because we need clean baby not soaking bathroom. And the tantrum before bed? It sounds like overtired kid who don't know how to shut up their brain before bed. That is not her fault and instead of punishment she need something to refocus, like you start to put to bed her favourite toy or start actively reading book with her. Only result of your punishment is that your daughter can't let out her energy with grandma and will be probably even more cranky, because maybe it is her sadness about grandma going home that wrecked your evening.", "INFO did you ever ask your daughter why she was having a bad day? Is she normally like this? Something seems off to me\u2026", "YTA. \"If you don't behave I'll punish your grandmother\". I wonder if you would have done the same thing with your own Mom or just the MIL. I think there is a good reason why you didn't tell us what you husband said.", "I'm a mom to 2 kids. For my DD, age 4 was HELL. Everything was tantrums and drama. I highly recommend the book \"Your Defiant Child\", fwiw.\n\nSoft YTA for choosing the wrong consequence. First, an immediate consequence would have taught your daughter better. Second, you ended up punishing Grandma too. \n\nBtw, you're not trying to control your daughter - you're trying to teach her how to behave properly and communicate effectively. This is hard work, for both of you. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nActions do have consequences, but it seems peculiar that the only single possible consequence that came to mind for you here was something that someone else was looking forward to doing with your daughter.", "Soft YTA, for the consequence that you chose.  I\ni get why you had to stick with it once it came out of your mouth, but children need immediate consequences at that age.", "YTA. Child sounds overly tired and fussy and you have way too high of expectations for a 4 year old.", " YTA your expectations of your daughter are not age appropriate. \n\n*even delayed the bath 10 minutes*. Yeah that gives your parenting style away if you regard that as some sort of big concession. You need to read a couple of books on child development and what\u2019s age appropriate for a 4 year old. She was having a hard time and you responded by setting hard limits that she was destined to break.", "YTA. \nYou already made plans for her and her grandma. You should\u2019ve chosen a different consequence.", "Behavior is communication. What was your daughter trying to tell you (unconsciously, obviously)? I do believe that sometimes what a kid is saying is \u201cFor the love of God, would someone please impose some limits\u201d but that\u2019s not the vibe I\u2019m getting from your description. Was she overtired? That can make it hand to impossible for little ones to control their impulses. Did she have a good time with your MIL? Could she have been upset that her grandma was leaving the next day?\n\nYes, it would be easier if they would just use their words, but sometimes they can\u2019t.\n\nMaybe if you focused less on proving that you\u2019re the one with the power and more on figuring out what\u2019s going on with your kid, evenings like this wouldn\u2019t escalate so quickly.\n\nAnd yes, I think sometimes kids need consequences (the natural ones, if possible) and they absolutely need limits and rules. But they also need understanding.", "Soft YTA - you are spot on in teaching the 4 year old that actions have consequences. Negative actions = negative consequences, positive actions = positive consequences. But at that age they don\u2019t have the fore-thinking to understand that something you did yesterday has a consequence today. It just needs to be a firm immediate consequence and move on. This would be more appropriate for like a 7 or 8 year old.", "YTA.\n\nThe real reason you did this could\u2019ve been summed up by the last sentence \u201cI\u2019m the parent, and my daughter should know actions have consequences.\u201d This was about YOU. Maybe it was about just power tripping, or feeling threatened by your MIL\u2019s presence, or just some good old fashioned unresolved childhood trauma of your own - it definitely wasn\u2019t about your 4 year old though. She\u2019s not going to learn anything valuable from this, but you\u2019re gonna tell yourself you did the right thing in order to fix your unhealed wounded ego.", "YTA. This punishment won't change a toddler's outbursts and you're taking quality time away from a kid and their grandma.", "YTA you could have chosen another punishment that wouldn't be punishing your MIL too.", "YTA. \n\nYour \u201cconsequence,\u201d was inappropriate for the situation and your child\u2019s age.", "YTA. Your follow through game is excellent, you aren't the AH for that. Sugar you are the AH for involving your MIL in your punishment game in the first place. What precisely were you trying to teach her? Surely it wasn't that if you act up, I will take Grandma away? \n\nYou were teaching her that privileges get taken away for  acting out. But Grandma isn't a privilege. The best thing you can do now is apologize to your daughter, set an alternative punishment clearly laying out why her behavior was wrong, and apologize to your MIL. You won't be eating crow, you will be teaching your daughter a valuable lesson - what to do when she is wrong.", "YTA\nYour daughter is a human, we all have bad days and deserve forgiveness. \nConsequences and structure are of course very important. But kids are kids, and you can\u2019t control every single thing down to the 10 minutes a bath veers off schedule when grandma is in town. \nIf you could relax a little, maybe you\u2019d be able to join in on the fun.", "Losing the park tomorrow is too distant and abstract of a consequence for a 4 year old. When she didn\u2019t stop splashing you should have drained the water immediately and rinsed her off and gotten her out. She sounds overtired and when that happens you just got to get them in bed.", "YTA. You could have just given her a timeout, not taken away something that impacts someone else.", "NAH Look I get what you were trying to do, and your not an AH for it. But I understand your MIL feelings. Your child is 4, this is going to be a very temporary punishment for her that she'll forget about in a week mostly likely. But those moments with her grandmother will likely last forever, even subconsciously. If she's staying with you, I'm assuming she doesn't live close enough to just take her another time. Which is why this is really sad.\n\nI think you need to find a way to give your child the opportunity to \"earn\" it back. Give her a chance to show that good behavior gets rewarded. Get her to clean her room or something like that. Of course, you shouldn't do this often. It's important to stick to your word with kids. But your actually punishing your MIL more for her bad behavior then her. And in the long run I don't think that's very kind for either of them. 4 year olds are toddlers, older toddlers, but still toddlers. They have no emotional regulation and make bad decisions. But you are an adult, you can recognize when a punishment hurts more then the person intended. There will be thousands of other times to show actions have consequences. Is this really worth it?", "NTA. Teach them young, others might think it's harsh, but in the long run it's best that they know the choices have consequences.", "NTA - this... good job mom!\n\n>I am the parent, and my daughter should know actions have consequences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot this though... ah hell no - this is my house lady.\n\n> then later complaining to my husband", "The lessons of you following through are worth it.", "NTA. Actions have consequences and it is much better to not make exceptions, ever, or they will learn to misbehave in certain situations. For example, if Grandma wants something, I can do anything and still get my outing. Or if I misbehave in public, Mom or Dad won't make a scene and I get what I want. The line was drawn. They can color for the afternoon.", "NTA\n\nYou're also proving to be a good parent.  The sooner you set strong boundaries, the easier it will be.  Don't cave!!", "Boundaries are important. Don't reward bad behavior.\n\nIf MIL can't accept your discipline, maybe she shouldn't be spending time with your child for a while.\n\nNTA.", "NAH - I think the AH votes are ridiculous and the comments about your parenting are mean-spirited (and I\u2019ll bet hypocritical). Worst case scenario, you\u2019ve levied an ineffective punishment on your daughter. This makes you a typical parent\u2026not an AH. A more immediate consequence *may* have been more effective given your daughter\u2019s age\u2026but let\u2019s be honest\u2026a lot of what goes into raising children is based on trial and error. Plus, your daughter is actually on the cusp of the age where children actually start to understand consequences (typically between 5 and 7), so it\u2019s not an absolute that your consequence in this case would not be effective. It just depends on the child. I see a lot of recommendations for parenting books on this post, but - realistically - while parenting books can offer suggestions\u2026there is nothing in existence that teaches you how to do the perfect thing at all times as a parent. You were doing the best you could in the moment. No one outside of this anonymous app would bat an eye if you told them your daughter couldn\u2019t go to the park for 1 afternoon due to bad behavior. Your MIL may be upset\u2026but again\u2026this is low stakes. She\u2019s been able to see her all week and will still be able to see her on the day in question.

Leaving aside whether a 4 year old is able to recall and understand why she can't do the activity today because of behaviour yesterday (spoiler alert, she can't), it's shitty of you to choose that thing as a lever to try and move your child's behaviour. \n\nThe thing is that your decision to prevent your daughter from going to the park with your MiL doesn't just affect your daughter, it's restricting the time your MiL can spend with your daughter and it's not fair of you to take that away from her unilaterally and for no good reason (like if your daughter was sick then that's different). The fact your MiL cares enough to be upset about this is a sign she likes and wants to spend time with your daughter, this isn't something to be deterred.\n\nI get that children can be frustrating when it's bedtime and they're tired and they can't focus on anything or behave well.
