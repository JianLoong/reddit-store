I was about 4-5 at the time and avoided anything to do with him. Then when he could walk and avoidance wasn\u2019t an option I got mean.

I\u2019m trying to fix it and we\u2019re on neutral footing now. I get my age was different than yours is but he deserves some kindness.

You both need help to work through the issues this has created but taking it out on him by giving him the cold shoulder and avoiding family gatherings is only going to make it worse.

Imagine being in his shoes and trying to be accepted into this new family. You're most likely going to have to see him at family gatherings for the rest of your life.

She can add the clarifier but yeah that\u2019s still there). I will admit that OP seems very immature. Only focused on their needs and sense of self. And asked if they were being an AH. Yes they kinda are. \n\nTheir feelings are fine and valid. But it\u2019s their utter lack of care for anyone else in this situation but themselves. And yes she\u2019s a teenage and outside factors. Yes I get that. But in this instance OP didn\u2019t handle the situation great. \n\nFor example. She shouldn\u2019t feel forced to have that sibling bond, I agree. She doesn\u2019t have to like him. But just say the truth. I was an only child but my parents adopted this kid a couple years ago, but I\u2019m not that close to him. To go out of your way to disown him from the family at all is hurtful. Opting out of family vacations now is absolutely petty af. If she doesn\u2019t hate him why isn\u2019t she going on these family trips? If she\u2019s uncomfortable or still wants time with her parents separately she could express that instead. From the sounds of it the only reason she isn\u2019t going, is because he is now part of the family. And while she doesn\u2019t hate him, that fact upsets her enough to try and remove herself from the family as much as possible. \n\nI get emotions are hard for everyone and including teens. But you can\u2019t see how these connections aren\u2019t being drawn by everyone on the outside. And you can\u2019t say you don\u2019t see how the brother feels like she hates him. And how she has been acting like an AH. Not saying she\u2019s wrong in her feelings and needs to force things. Not at all. But that doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s not hurting people in the process and asked an honest opinion on the matter. \n\nOP you having feelings isn\u2019t bad. But try to look outside yourself a little more and see how what you say or do is affecting others. There are adjustments you can make to not hurt your family and the kid your parents adopted without sacrificing your own feelings. I mean that right there is a middle ground for you. He doesn\u2019t have to be your \u201cbrother\u201d, but you are no longer an only child. Just refer to him as the kid your parents adopted. Might still be considered harsh, but at least your acknowledging his existence and his place in the family. Talk to your parents about therapy. I\u2019d suggest solo vs family atm. And see why this is truly bothering you so much. You could be feeling jealousy, neglected, etc. there\u2019s a lot to unpack. You can be honest with you feelings, but I\u2019d suggest instead of making an eternal decision. Just label your feelings as right now. Saying you will never think of him that way hurts a lot more than simply saying you don\u2019t think of him that way atm and sorry if that hurts his feelings. But right now it looks like you hold a lot of resentment towards the situation that\u2019s coming out at him, your parents, etc. If you can figure that out you can start to build a healthy relationship with him and even if it\u2019s not a brother and sister one. And if the forcing of that bond by everyone\u2019s causing you to want to put more distance between you guys. Express that. Express that at the moment you don\u2019t feel that way. And whenever people try to force or expect you to act a certain way, it actually makes the situation worse. Who knows what would happen if you were given the space to process and figure it out. I could keep going but I already wrote a novel. Haha so I\u2019ll leave it at that for now. Your feelings are valid and normal. You don\u2019t need to feel bad for having feelings. But there is a healthier way to handle things. And if you put yourself in the other persons shoes you can see why the actions come across AH-like. Yes it\u2019s muddy and complicated. So you aren\u2019t as a person an AH. But what you described sounds like you\u2019ve clearly hurt some feelings. And have been for a while and justify it even when others are trying to show you how the other side sees it. Which if you\u2019re not careful, could turn you into an AH. So at least check in and apologize for hurting feelings and maybe even open up to the adopted brother and tell him it\u2019s not him, it\u2019s just been an adjustment for you, that you didn\u2019t really want a sibling so it\u2019s not him, it\u2019s just been difficult to get use to especially when you feel like why did they even ask you if nobody was going to actually talk about it with you. But You don\u2019t hate him, you just aren\u2019t there yet to call him brother. And don\u2019t want to lie to him. If you can do that, things might be easier all around. And you might even feel a weight has been lifted off you.", "You don't have to love them but you don't have to ignore their existance either. They're just as human as you are and were quite literally forced into this situation, especially if they were adopted at such a late age.\n\nSo shut that down right now.
