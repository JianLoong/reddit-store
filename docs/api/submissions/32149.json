We took a bus home and back. My friends were with their families for Thanksgiving. They all live about an hour or so away from me in different directions.\r  \n\r  \nMy sister Calliope is homeschooled, this is because earlier this year she got expelled from school (a private school) after Cedar and a few other of his friends reported her for bullying a boy for being trans, a boy Cedar is friends with. She used the t slur multiple times and it was quite bad bullying.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m embarrassed by my sister\u2019s behavior. It also doesn\u2019t end there, as earlier this year Cole came out and Calliope was not happy about it, and has called him the f slur. Cedar doesn\u2019t like this either and will ask Cole if he\u2019s ok when this happens but her bullying his trans friend has destroyed their relationship. \r  \n\r  \nMy parents tried getting Calliope in therapy but she refused to go and my parents said they weren\u2019t going to force her to do anything and that \u201cshe\u2019s just a moody teenage girl\u201d and that we should \u201cgive her a break\u201d. \r  \n\r  \nOn Friday, when my friends finally arrived at my parents house, my family introduced themselves. \r  \n\r  \nMy friends met Calliope and my parents first, she had some homeschooling work out and one of my friends asked about it and she was talking about it, and then they said she was homeschooled because she was being bullied in school. I decided to go along with the lie and made up a few details. \r  \n\r  \nWe then went to see Cole. We then saw Cedar, who was in the basement watching some baseball documentaries with his friends. One of my friends plays baseball at our school and my brother was excited I had a friend he could relate to. We watched one of the documentaries with them. Then at the end, my friend was talking to Cedar and asked about school and if he\u2019s been bullied. Cedar was confused until my friend explained what he had heard about Calliope.\r  \n\r  \nCedar and his friends didn\u2019t hesitate to tell the truth, and told my friends what really happened, and they were getting quite angry, as his trans friend was in the room as well. The boys were pissed that we would lie and called out my sister\u2019s transphobia and homophobia.\r  \n\r  \nMy friends were very upset that I lied to them and even threatened to leave and not stay at our place, I convinced them to stay but they said I\u2019d need to re-earn their trust.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m conflicted on if I did the right thing, I thought I was just protecting my sister and saving myself from embarrassment, but seeing my friends being upset as well as seeing Cedar and the other boy\u2019s faces turn red when talking about Calliope is making me question things.

It also stunts her ability to learn from her mistakes and grow to be a better person. By lying for her, you\u2019re telling her it\u2019s okay to do hurtful things to others. \n\nSomething better to say would be *that\u2019s not true, it\u2019s actually the opposite, but I\u2019ll allow you (sister) to tell the truth or we can change the subject*. That gives her the opportunity to own up, accept responsibility and grow from her mistakes.", "YTA\n\nYou lied to your friends, they found out, now you\u2019re dealing with the fallout.  That\u2019s on you.", "&#x200B;\n\n1) first of all your sister is not \u201cjust a moody teenage girl\u201c - she\u2019s bullying people and being bigoted. She\u2019s definitely a AH. Your parents not making her attend therapy sessions and excusing her behaviour is a way of actually CONDONING her behaviour. This is totally sending your sister the wrong message. It\u2019s also sending Cole the wrong message because it\u2019s telling Cole that your parents are choosing her over him.\n\n2) when your parents lied on her behalf, again, it\u2019s giving her the message that what she\u2019s doing is \u201cOK\u201c by them. While I realize it would\u2019ve been really difficult for you to confront them in that moment, certainly agreeing and making up some kind of stories/adding to the lie is also giving your sister the same message from YOU. You could have stayed silent, and as soon as you left the room, you could\u2019ve told your friends that you are embarrassed by your sisters behaviour, but you didn\u2019t feel comfortable to confront your parents in that moment. \n\n3) your sister has already destroyed her own relationship with Cole, and if your parents continue to ignore and support her behaviour, they are going to ruin their own relationship with him. In this case they are TA. Naturally, this is also going to affect their relationship with Cedar.\n\nso yes, you were TA for lying to your friends and adding to your sisters stories about the real reason why she\u2019s being homeschooled. But I will soften the TA judgment, because I realize it would\u2019ve been very awkward and difficult to confront your parents in that moment. Had it just been your sister making the lie, then you should\u2019ve confronted it in that moment.", "YTA.  Why protect a transphobe and homophobe?  Did you honestly think that your friends wouldn't find out?  If you friends spent any time around your other siblings, they were bound to find out.", "YTA.  You let them be lied to, went along with the lie, and went further by embellishing the lie to make it sound more plausible.  They might still have been mad when they found out the truth if you had said nothing, but they are likely more mad with the part you played in furthering the lie.", "Yeah, I\u2019d be pissed too if my friend didn\u2019t warn me I\u2019d staying in a place with a raging homophobic and transphobic bigot. \n\nYou realize this comes across as you taking your sister\u2019s side in all this right? \n\nYou\u2019re incredibly fortunate that your friends are willing to give you the chance to re-earn their trust. Don\u2019t squander it. \n\nI understand the pull to shield yourself from embarrassment, but you\u2019re not in high school anymore, it\u2019s time to grow up and act in a principled manner. You can do it! For the time being tho, YTA", "YTA you didn't even have to lie. You could have just said something like \"Some stuff went down but I don't want to talk about it.\" Lying and making her the victim minimizes what she did and makes it sound like you don't care", "YTA but family loyalty is complicated. \n\nYour sister needs to own her actions and stop being a jerk. You don't need to protect her although I do understand why you'd be embarrassed to be associated with her but protecting her (if it was that and not more about your own embarrassment) definitely implies you support her over the victims.", "YTA.  Protecting a bigot is repulsive, and has me wondering what your real feelings are.", "Yta.  You want to protect your sister because she's a bigot, and that makes you a bigot too. And I'm glad your friends know now.", "Nope, definitely YTA", "YTA for letting your sister lie about being the victim when she was the perpetrator.\n\nYou broke your friends trust and sided with a bigot", "I love that she is playing the victim. She could have said anything else, even that she did not want to talk about it, or that she prefers homeschooling, wanted to try it, wasn't getting a good education, etc. But no, she chose to.make herself the victim when she was the aggressor. Interesting", "OMG YTA. Great job teaching your horrible sister to just jeep being horrible.", "YTA.  You could have played dumb, stayed quiet, and just let your parents say whatever they wanted to say.  but instead you inserted yourself in your parents\u2019 lie and became an active participant.", "YTA for trolling this \"teenage girl is bigoted towards brother's trans/gay/person of color friend\" nonsense again. What exactly is your problem with teenage girls? I'm going to assume that you're a forty something sleeze who gets rejected by the high girls you hit on in the mall.", "So, you wanted to protect your sister from the consequences of her bigotry and make her look good knowing full well the effects her bigotry has had on your brother and his friends? \n\nYTA.", "ESH, except your brothers and their friends.  \n\nIf you had just said nothing when Calliope lied, and then talked to her later about lying and also told your friends the truth, you\u2019d be good.  Given how your friends later (over)reacted, calling her out on the spot would have been a bad idea - she\u2019s a child, you and your friends are adults, if only just barely, and it sounds like they would have come down on her hard, in a group.  You *do* have an obligation to protect her to some extent.  But when you made stuff up in support of her lie, you became an AH.  \n\nCedar and his friends are within bounds for telling on Calliope - and by extension, you - because they are the same age and one of them was a target of her bullying.  It\u2019s not their job to protect her from the consequences of her own actions, especially not when those actions caused them pain.  \n\nYour friends ought to have understood that you were embarrassed and caught off guard, and given you some slack.  And they should have known better than to be asking a thirteen-year-old they just met about being bullied.  \n\nAnd your parents need to get their heads out of their asses and figure out what the heck is going on with Calliope, because kids don\u2019t persist in aggressive antisocial behaviors despite serious consequences just for kicks.", "YTA", "YTA. You didnt protect your sister. You shielded her from the justified consequences of her actions. You enabled her hateful bigotry. Its people like you and your parents who keep bigotry alive by protecting the bigots. You're part of the problem. You're friends and brothers are better people than you your sister and parents.", "YTA. You did the wrong thing. \n\nYou joined in w/her in enabling a harmful lie, to *your* friends, and added false details. For no better reason than it was easiest for you. You need to take a long hard look @ who you want to be and what kind of friend you are. You\u2019ll be lucky to keep those friends. That you still don\u2019t seem to get how wrong you were is pretty disturbing.\n\nYour parents are minimizing about Calliope, and it does her no favors. I\u2019d say the same about you minimizing what you did. *People kill themselves over that kind of bullying.*", "YTA. What did you think was going to happen when Cole or Cedar told your friends the truth? Also, WHY are you trying to protect a bigot?? I don't blame your friends at all for wanting to leave, because by lying about your sister, you're basically showing that you agree with what she said and did because otherwise why wouldn't you call her out on her lie?", "NTA - You didn't do anything wrong, simply put your friends have no real right to know the intimate details of your families problems. \"Why is your sister homeschooled\" feels a lot like \"why is your brother in jail\" kinda talk. The issue we're discussing here is not the bullying, but how you broached the subject with your friends who are strangers to your family.\n\nYou're going to get massacred in the comments and I really don't even know if this is real or not. I don't see a world where any kid feels fine going over to their bullies house, friend with a sibling or not. This whole thing feels fake. I'm seeing a lot of people here talking about a 13 year old like they're in the KKK or the Hitler Youth or something. \n\nMy two cents is make sure that you take proper care of those kids as they continue to grow and mature, I think 13 year olds should have a right to learn from their mistakes and not have it chase them everywhere.", "Your sister absolutely should absolutely be held accountable for her homophobia and transphobia, but I also think that you were well within your rights to protect the privacy of a 13 year old from people who are, essentially, a group of random adult strangers. If she were an adult this would be a different story, of course. And you shouldn\u2019t have embellished your parents\u2019 lie\u2014I understand why your friends are hurt by that. But I just don\u2019t think that you had a responsibility to tell your friends about the behavioral record of a middle-schooler, no matter how atrocious and hurtful it may be.
