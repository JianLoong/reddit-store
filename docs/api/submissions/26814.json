I'm curious to hear your thoughts. I had a nightmare tenant at the start of 2022. I thought I got lucky finding someone as qualified as him, but after the first month I quickly learned I was duped. He faked his paystubs, gave phony references, and never paid any rent after the first month/security deposit. After all I could secure an eviction, he managed to rack up a debt of just over $30,000 in combined past-due rent and damages. After the eviction I managed to secure a judgement against tenants for a slightly lesser amount. \n\n\r  \nI had no intention of dealing with these people anymore, and I also didn\u2019t feel like it would be worth it to sell off their debt to collectors for a fraction of the total. I wanted to make him pay as much as he could, and I know how easy it is to dodge collections if someone just doesn\u2019t care about their credit or responsibilities. It\u2019s like getting water from a stone. So instead, I went a more unconventional route. \r  \nI decided to forgive his entire debt and filed a 1099-C with the IRS for the full amount. For those who aren\u2019t aware, this is a form that relieves the debtor of their obligations to repay, while at the same time turning the forgiven debt into taxable income for the tenant. This means they'll have to square up with the IRS instead of me. I felt this was the most pragmatic approach. Instead of wasting my energy trying to extract money from someone who clearly wasn't going to pay, I figured the IRS will cause them some similar headaches as they did to me while living in my home.  \n\n\r  \nLike I said, I've shared this with a few folks and the reactions have been neutral to negative. I was only trying to give a realistic perspective of dealing with collecting money after an eviction. I think it\u2019s a smart move, but others consider it cruel. \n\ntl;dr: forgave a tenant's debt so they can deal with the IRS instead.\n\n\r  \nAITA for handling the debt this way?", "created_utc": 1694632985, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hw6l8/aita_for_forgiving_a_former_tenants_debt/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I did this as a way to get back at the tenant by making them deal with the IRS instead of me or some collections agency. I could have just not pursued the debt since either way I'm not getting any money repaid from them. Forgiving the debt and reporting it to the IRS least can cause some financial headaches back to the tenant.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Very creative solution. They didn't want to pay you so they get to pay the IRS instead.

Bravo!", "I think it was brilliant", "NTA, nothing negative at all with what you did. You got stuck on the hook for the $30K that you did not receive in rent and I assume you had to pay out of pocket for the damages. Collecting on bad rents is almost impossible. Maybe this serial bad tenant will have second thoughts before doing this to someone else.", "Amazing. Kudos.", "Except this does not get OP any money: the taxes on the $30K undeclared income will get to the IRS. So more of a gotcha against the tenant than anything.\n\nHowever if OP has a lot of rental business, the ability to take the $30K write off might help OP on their own taxes.", "The loss could absolutely help OP defer his tax burden.  Regardless, sticking the deadbeat tenant with a tax bill sounds satisfying.  You don\u2019t want to owe money to the IRS - they will come after you hard."]}
