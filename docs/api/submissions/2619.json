She is an amazing kid and I\u2019m so lucky and grateful for her but my pregnancy was definitely not planned and my BD who we\u2019ll call Allen was not a very good guy. We were friends in high school and started dating when I was 19 and he was 20. At that point I had already had my license in cosmetology from BOCES and was working in a salon. He was unemployed and living with his grandma but moved in with me after few months. I supported him financially and even helped him get a car by putting my name on the registration. And then I got pregnant. All throughout my pregnancy I worked full time while he did nothing. Anyway, after I had my daughter he left for almost a year then came back begging for another chance. I let him back and then he repeated the same thing over and over again until sienna was 4, the last time he left he didn\u2019t come back and I was at peace with this. I raised sienna basically on my own and we are very happy. He has payed minimal child support through the years and sent some cards anytime he remembered. I won\u2019t even get into the the hell eh out me through but I wholeheartedly hate this man.\n\nFast forward to last week. I was at work when I got a call from a number I didn\u2019t recognize, ignored it. The number calls again and this time I pick up and it\u2019s Allen. He got my number from a mutual friend on Facebook and called to ask if he could start seeing sienna, swearing that he changed and was ready to start fresh. I knew he hadn\u2019t changed much at all based on the fact that with minimal internet stalking you would find that I am now 1 of 3 baby mamas and his youngest kid is only 2. And he is still couch hopping and apparently hasn\u2019t held a job for more than a few months. I denied his request. I know sienna has always felt abandoned by him and hurt that he left her and I knew he would do it again and I don\u2019t wanna put her through that again. \n\nHe said I\u2019m being a selfish prick and I shouldn\u2019t take away my daughters chance to have a relationship with her father just because I don\u2019t like him. He is threatening to take me to court and I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t wanna put sienna through this and I feel horrible. My sister thinks I should see how it goes to give sienna a chance to have a father figure but I just don\u2019t know.", "created_utc": 1668738830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yy8tg2/aita_for_denying_my_bd_visitation_to_my_daughter/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he hasn't held a job for more than a few months, and is couch surfing, no court is going to grant him much in the way of custody/visitation. Not to mention the costs associated with going to court.", " NTA but perhaps ask your daughter how she would feel about him coming back into her life. Say it as a hypothetical to gauge her reaction. Then be honest with her if their is some interest. She's old enough to decide and if you make the choice from her she could resent you later. Good luck", "This isn't your call. Your daughter is 15. Ask her if she ***wants*** to know him.", "NTA. I think you should see how your daughter feels. She\u2019s 15 so the courts will take her wishes into consideration. I can appreciate wanting to protect her from being hurt, but in doing so you may hurt her worse.", "NTA\n\nTell him to take you to court. It is clear he is much too lazy to actually do that.", "NTA, very rational stance to take. Just maybe your daughter what she wants? She is old enough to share the decision", "NTA.  He\u2019s bluffing - he\u2019s not going to take you to court.  A lawyer costs money.  Court costs money.  This guy is not going to spend money on that.  However - you should talk to your daughter a out all this.  Calm and just the facts.  Also tell her your concerns, that he has other kids, that you\u2019re worried he\u2019ll abandon her again and don\u2019t want to see her hurt.  She\u2019s 15.  She\u2019s old enough for facts, and then at least she\u2019ll be prepared if he does disappoint her.  Then the two of you can decide what to do together.  If she wants to meet him, make it a supervised visit at first.  Honestly, this guy is a drifter and will probably drift on out of your life soon enough.", "\"You say you've changed? Great. Prove it. First off, you need to write an apology letter to Sienna, so I have something I can show her if and when she's ready to read it. Make sure it includes a genuine acknowledgment of the things you did wrong and a sincere apology. Then, child support. I understand that 11 years of back payments is a large sum of money to have all at once, so you can start making current payments and write up what kind of payment plan you think is fair and reasonable. Finally, you'll need to demonstrate that you won't just disappear again... That one's going to be tricky, so I'm open to suggestions. Maybe you can start with explaining what other multi-year commitments you've kept in the past 11 years?\"\n\nNTA. Your priority has to be your daughter, not your ex. Until you see clear evidence that he's changed, it's a huge risk to let him visit with your daughter when history suggests that he will just leave her with more abandonment issues.\n\nThat being said, I agree with other commenters that your daughter is old enough to have a say in this decision... But there's a big difference between having a say and having her feel like it's all her responsibility. So I'd probably start with having mini conversations with her, slipping in questions like, \"Do you ever feel different that you just have a mom? Or do any of your other friends have the same kind of living situation?\" and \"How much do you remember about your dad?\" Hopefully, you can start to get a sense of whether she'd want to see him or not... And if you think she would, you can then ask her more directly", "NTA.\n\nAs for court, here\u2019s what the court is most likely to do: look at his abandonment of her, his lack of stable living place or job, his lack of involvement in her life, and officially give you 100% custody.  At most, he\u2019ll get some limited visitation - he doesn\u2019t have a place for her to live, so he won\u2019t get custody.  That\u2019s the MOST they\u2019ll do.  If you talk about the trauma to you and her of the multiple times he sailed in and out of your life, and the fact that you fear he\u2019ll do exactly the same thing, digging the scars even deeper, there\u2019s a chance he won\u2019t even get that.  At her age, they\u2019ll want to talk to her about what she wants, so make sure you know that before things start.", "NTA\n\nI would ask your daughter what she wants, be honest about his status without shitting on him. I\u2019d also be clear about your and her expectations if you both decide to give him a chance.", "NTA.  But please start being open with Sienna about the times he contacts you.  She\u2019s old enough where she has or will have her own phone.  If he finds her number and starts trying to talk to her directly, it might not be good if you keep facts from her.", "NTA. \n\nBut you need to tell your daughter what\u2019s going on. Explain why you don\u2019t want her to see him, don\u2019t leave out any of the details. Tell her she can make the decision for herself when she turns 18, but for now you\u2019re protecting her.", "NTA\n\nOP, talk to your daughter. See how she feels about the situation. Your ex might approach her without you knowing, and she should be ready for it, one way or another.\n\nShe is 15 yo, and not a toddler that can be easily swayed by a few candies. Treat her as a young adult and let her decide how she wants to deal with her estranged father.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Once he is back in the good grace  of the court, being caught up on back pay.. then let him see her", "NTA\n\nFrom what you've said, I doubt Allen will sue. It seems he doesn't have enough money to even talk to an attorney.\n\nHowever, you've got a 15-year-old. They tend to have minds of their own. Talk to Sienna about what has happened. Play it pretty neutral, giving her the facts and telling her why you made this decision. Ask what she thinks.\n\nIf Allen keeps harassing you, contact the police. You could also consult an attorney about getting a restraining order on him.", "NTA. No court would give him custody after you being primary parent for 15 years. Only thing court would do is to give the choice to sienna based in her age.", "NTA. Tell him to go right ahead and take you to court with his fictional lawyer that he can't pay for. And get your documents showing how far behind he isnin child support. It will not go well for him", "NTA. You\u2019re protecting her and that\u2019s the right thing. He has no rights because he\u2019s abandoned her. Let him take you to court. He\u2019ll get laughed out of there. If she wants to see him when she\u2019s 18, he can take that up with her. Or, you know, start paying child support.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and not only are you NTA but I wouldn\u2019t allow it and I probably wouldn\u2019t tell my daughter. 15 is YOUNG and there\u2019s not enough life experience there to know if something is good or bad for you- just feelings. \n\nI\u2019m in the same situation as you. The BEST gift he ever gave us was going away and staying away. Your ex waited 15 fucking years, he can wait 3 more. It\u2019s not going to kill him or her. But letting him in now can really mess her up. You didn\u2019t move mountains for 15 years for him to come in now and blow them up. \n\n15 year olds don\u2019t get to decide to allow dangerous ppl access to them just bc they\u2019re 15. That\u2019s not developmentally appropriate. \n\nThat\u2019s why 15 year olds can\u2019t buy cigarettes, alcohol, sign contracts, sign up for the Armed Forces, drive in most places, quit high school, etc. There are reasons we\u2019re still legally responsible for our 15 year olds. \n\nIf you decide to do it, the only way I\u2019d allow it is if she went to and participated in 3 months of weekly therapy before the first meet. He\u2019s going to break her heart and she needs support firmly in place before that happens.", "NTA  tell him you'll see him in court and you'll also be discussing the back child support. I would ask your daughter what she wants to do. She may just want to see him and ask some questions.", "NTA... NEVER AGAIN... maybe once he has a longterm job, paid all of his children's child support, gone to therapy and then when your child is old enough to know if she wants a relationship. So NEVER", "NTA\n\nHell nah,\n\nYou should def talk to ur daughter tho and let her know. shes old enough\n\nLet him take u to court... he is literally homeless lmfao. he isnt going to get shit. not to mention he hasnt seen her in years. he wont get shit", "NTA. But you need to talk to Sienna, she needs to know that he\u2019s reached out\u2026 she\u2019ll probably not be interested in him anyway but she\u2019s 15 now and deserves a say\ud83d\ude0a", "Sadly, he has rights as the father. That said, you could make him go to court in order to exercise those rights. That would not involve your daughter much (if any).\n\nOr you could say, \"catch up on your support, to show you mean it, and then we'll make arrangements.\" If he can't pay outstanding support, it's unlikely he can afford a lawyer. And even if he can, a judge might not be too accommodating, given his history.\n\nOh, and *he's* the one taking away your daughter's chance at a relationship with him. Not you. He's doing a fine job of that all by himself. You might clarify that if he pulls that shit again.\n\nNTA\n\nGood luck.", "I don't think he is serious about going to court. They would be looking at child support.\n\nI do think that you should let your daughter know about this. As s***** as he is, she should know that he does want to see her.\n\nEdit: NTA for not giving him access now. However, I think that if after understanding that he likely hasn't changed and will not stick around for long, your daughter still wants to see him, she's old enough that she should be able to do that with supervision. I also think that if she's in counseling you should talk to her counselor about this, and if she isn't she should be.", "NTA. First, don't worry about court. He's couch surfing so it's not like he's got money to hire a lawyer. He also doesn't have a home and no judge is going to grant him custody. \n\nSecond, this actually shouldn't be your decision, it should be Sienna's. Find out what she wants.", "Please don't be afraid.  Going to court costs money that he doesn't have. His living situation won't work in his favor.  Your daughter is old enough for the courts to listen to her wishes.  I'm so sorry you're going through this.  NTA", "NTA.  Get an attorney and lay the groundwork for a restraining order.  It sounds like you have plenty of evidence that he is not a fit dad.  Keep protecting your daughter.", "\\~NTA\\~  \nIf being an A for putting your daughter's best interests ahead of the \u2018Dad\u201d then so be it.\n\nthis time. make it legal.", "NTA \n\nI think you should welcome going to court! \n\nThough I doubt he will do it. Even if by some miracle he gets his act together, it\u2019s still the right choice. Court will force him to put in work to see his daughter. Visitation would start slowly and there\u2019s no way he would get immediate custody. Given he doesn\u2019t even have a place to live, realistically, he\u2019d never get custody. This is not something you have to realistically worry about. \n\nHe\u2019s calling you because it\u2019s a lot easier that filling out paperwork and showing up to a court date. Next time he calls, calmly tell him that he\u2019s right and he should do everything through the courts. Then hang up.", "NTA\n\nDon't give this guy any rights he doesn't already have.  He is unlikely to take you to court because that takes money and effort and he's not going Ng to expend either.  If he does take you to court, you hire a good Family lawyer, get a therapist to tell the court that unsupervised visitation isn't in your child's best interest, ask the court to drug test your Ex, and file for enforcement of child support including and back child support and for support for your daughter's advanced education.  Your lawyer could easily make this guy resent ever contacting you.\n\nYou really need to talk to your daughter.  If your Ex can find you, he can probably find out how to contact your daughter directly on social media m. Kindly and simply explain that her father contacted you, unemotionally describe his past behavior and what you know of his present circumstances.  Tell her that you wish he was a better parent to her, but you wanted to warn her to not trust him if he contacts or approaches her.vvexplain that it's your responsibility as her parent to protect her.  Tell her that she should let you know if she's contacted by her father and shouldn't go alone anywhere with him alone.  \n\nLastly, if you have an existing child support and order, you might contact your state and ask about back due support and enforcement to get that support.  Your daughter deserves the support.  It's one thing to ignore the overdue support because you're better off without him in your life, but if he's going to be in contact, you may as well let the state go after him.  If anything comes of it, you could set the money aside for some extra costs for your daughter.", "YTA (little ah) you made a choice for your daughter while it is up to her. Sure your heart is in the right place and you want to protect her but that should be her choice, not yours.", "YTA. Nothing you said ever actually involved asking your child what she would like. She's 15. She's old enough to have a choice in whether or not she should meet with her father or not. \n\nYou acted completely out of your own anger and bitterness. Not once did you consider the child you claim is so important. Don't you think she should have the opportunity to meet her father and come to her own conclusions about him? You haven't said he's violent or dangerous and if he has changed why wouldn't you want your child to have a relationship with their parent?", "They won't grant him overnights, but he's very likely to get daytime visitation", "I was about 11 or 12 when my BD (biodad) came back and wanted to see me. He was a stranger to me completely.  My mother gave me the choice. I chose to see him and it was supervised visitation once a week. After a couple of months he stopped showing up.  I'm sure my mother's heart broke for me and that it was exactly what she was afraid would happen. She made me go into therapy to cope with abandonment issues. He turned up a couple more times throughout my young adult years but never with consistency or consideration honestly. We never really bonded. I still got a chance to meet him which going back I would do again. You know who he is and what he will likely do. Speak to her honestly and without talking shit on him. Tell her your worries briefly but let her choose and that you'll support her and be there for her and with her no matter what. Oh and NTA you're not being spiteful you're being protective but shes big enough to choose.", "And tell him you will sue for back child support!", "I agree. She is 15 years old and therefore mature enough to know the truth of the matter. Be transparent with your daughter, allow her to express her concerns and feelings as well. And if she really decides she wants to meet him then have a supervised visit with her."]}
