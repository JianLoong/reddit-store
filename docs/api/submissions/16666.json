It\u2019s a destination wedding, so he should assume some guests can\u2019t make it. It\u2019s a \u201cno kids\u201d wedding, so he should assume some guests can\u2019t make it.  That\u2019s a double whammy.  I really dislike the people who set a high bar for their friends and family to attend the wedding and are then surprised when people can\u2019t come. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nHe specifically does not want your children there, for whatever reason. Thats his right. Its his wedding. Does it suck? Yes. Save your money and go have a fun vacation with your children.", "NTA, he should have kept it to the same \u201cclass\u201d of guest, at least.  Siblings kids yes or no, not just favoring one over the other.  \n\nI would call him and just say \u201chey, just heard that our kids aren\u2019t invited.  We assumed they were since [cousins] were invited so this throws a wrench into our plans.  In-laws aren\u2019t able to watch them since they are doing elder care  for Grandma in law now.  Wife and I will talk about it and figure out if just I will attend or none of my family.  Wanted to let you know as soon as we realized this rule included our kids since it might affect your numbers/wedding party decisions\u201d.  \n\nThen stop talking and see what he says.  His response will tell you whether you want to work to overcome your hurt feelings and go alone or not.", "YWNBTA.", "If you care about your brother, I think you should talk it out with him without laying down ultimatums.", "Have you spoken to him about it and asked him if your whole family can come? NTA for asking and expressing your feelings. And if you feel strongly enough not to go, then don\u2019t go. \n\nBut honestly if you and your wife have someone you trust to watch the kids and have left them for that long before (or they\u2019re old enough to handle it), it could be a nice kid-free getaway for you and your wife. Your sister isn\u2019t really going to enjoy herself if she has to watch her kids the whole time.\n\nOr bring them and hire a sitter just for the wedding and reception and make it into a family trip.", "YWNBTA. Seems a bit unfair to allow your sister\u2019s kids and not yours. Would be uncomfortable and likely hurtful to explain to your kids that their cousins are invited and they\u2019re not.", "NTA, you found out who the favored sibling is\u2026..I wouldn\u2019t go", "INFO: Are your brother's assumptions correct? Did you have child care lined up?", "NTA\n\nI hate destination weddings.  I really do.", "NTA for being upset, but before you use the nuclear option, talk to him about it.", "NTA", "NTA. If you make a rule it should apply to everyone equally.", "NTA and i am hearing this sort of thing so often lately\u2026. like two siblings get a plus one and one doesn\u2019t and again one sibling gets a plus one and another who is a groomsman doesn\u2019t. I think I would still try and go to the wedding if i could work it out.", "Nta. How many other people coming to the wedding have kids that are staying home?", "NTA I could see if you were his friend, but you are equally his sibling.

Leave your wife and kids at home. Be sure to bring up at every chance, very loudly that you did not have a sitter and no kids were allowed.   Make a spectacle of it. \n\nThat approach isn\u2019t for everyone obviously. Maybe have a convo with your brother and explain your feelings.   Tell him what you are considering.  Depending on his remarks, you can decide what to do.", "It depends if you could actually get somebody to look after your kids. Can you? Or are you just not doing when it's potentially do-able purely to be petty? I see from the other comments that you've not asked your parents-in-law. Maybe you should. If it's not possible, then tell your brother and see if the alteration in your circumstances alters the answer. \n\nExpect to pay for them to attend on your own dime, though. Destination weddings aren't cheap, obviously. It's fair enough if you're paying for yourself, but if it's a cost thing on his part, I can see why he might have wanted to avoid paying for more people to come along who won't get anything out of it (ie more unnecessary children).\n\nAssuming you're not asking your in-laws purely to be petty, which is seems is the case from the other comments, YTA.", "[deleted]", "YWBTA. It\u2019s understandable you would feel some kind of way about the double standard.  That\u2019s a legitimate issue. However, refusing to go because of it is kind of petty unless you truly do have child care problems.  There may be other factors. Then again, if you are going to be resentful and surly, it would be better to just not go.  Are you sure this isn\u2019t just one of many instances where your sister was treated differently? Are you, by any chance, the middle child?", "NTA but I would still go if you could get child care. I would be very angry too but this is his wedding would you regret in the future not going? I\u2019m in a tricky situation almost just like this for my brothers wedding. So I feel your pain.", "N necessarily TA but are you willing to put your relationship with your brother and potentially the rest of your family over this. Clearly there is a reason he decided to exclude your kids verses hers. A couple questions come up, what exactly are the ages? What are their personalities like? Do your kids tend to be high energy, hyper active, loud? Are her kinda calmer or quieter? There is probably a reason other than lack of babysitting that those kids are allowed. And that\u2019s his choice. \n\nAnd not going would be your choice. And you wouldn\u2019t be an asshole for not going for feeling this way, but expect some blowback.", "NAH \n\nI think you\u2019re over complicating this. You seem interested in taking your family to the city where the wedding is. Your brother us free to have a no kids wedding but he does not get to dictate who can and cannot travel to the city where is getting married. Book the trip, go to the wedding while your wife does something else with the kids for a few hours.", "YTA if you make decisions around attendance before you have even tried to have a conversation with your brother", "ESH. Why would you even want to bring kids to a wedding.  It's pretty normal to not want kids at a wedding.  Sounds like you're being petty.

He might give you an exception if he knows you  can\u2019t find childcare. Your reaction is premature. Don\u2019t threaten not to go to his wedding until you know for sure he\u2019s not willing to make the same exception for you that he\u2019s willing to make for your  sister.", "Offer to split the cost of a nanny, babysitter, mother's helper for the duration of the wedding with your sister and then have fun with your kids the rest of the time. \n\nIs there anyone you know with a college-aged child or someone you know who has a fabulous babysitter that would like to travel with you?", "Question still stands. You said it was still up in the air AFTER saying you don\u2019t have options. Puts your credibility into question. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the a-hole for being upset, but if you do end up finding a babysitter, is it worth the potential blowback if you decide not to go?", "We will not be hiring any babysitter. Never have, never will. If my wife says she doesn't want her parents to watch the kids then we have no childcare. Is that clear? She has given me the option of going by myself.", "Wow. That's a **lot** of pressure to put on aging relatives who are themselves looking after aging relatives.", "You\u2019re still avoiding the question on why your comments aren\u2019t consistent. Is that clear?", "I\u2019m not seeing any inconsistencies that are concerning. They don\u2019t have reliable childcare available, and they have personal boundaries regarding who watches their kids. i imagine they would know both these things already if they were in regular contact with the in laws.\n\nPersonally, I would ask brother if the entire family could come or just pull a Harry-style visit and show up for the big event and head out ASAP to get back to the family. But I also think it\u2019s acceptable to regret and stay home if it\u2019s a child-free destination wedding. That kind of wedding is a big ask for parents, so I\u2019m sure the bride and groom know some people won\u2019t be able to come."]}
