If his response is \"too bad\" then don't go. \n\nHe can do what he wants for his wedding but he has to accept that may have unforseen consequences.", "Do they have childcare at the resort?", "YTA is \u201csomewhat unfair\u201d enough reason to explode your relationship?\n\nBecause it will NEVER recover.\n\nThe fact is that all the heightened emotions of the bride and groom during the pre-wedding period, make them both unusually sensitive to emotional pain, and also make their decision making somewhat sketchy.\n\nChoose instead to acknowledge that it\u2019s unfair - and love your brother anyway.\n\nLove him enough to not bring it up , and to forgive him for being unfair about this.\n\nYour brother can be a forever relationship - unless you hurt him on his most special day.", "So he made an exception for your sister because of her situation and didn't give you an exception because he thought you were in a different situation.\n\nIt would be N-T-A, except you haven't talked to him about it at all and went straight to not going, so YTA.", "NTA\n\nI like the suggestion someone suggested of saying to your brother that you don't actually have any child care for your children (inlaws are unavailable - don't give any more info than that because you don't have to justify or explain this - they just can't do it) and that you need to discuss with your wife as to what the best option is for your family.\n\nBecause of how close your kids are to their cousins I would err on the side of not going.  If they didn't care... they I'd just go alone for the shortest time possible.  I liked the idea of you taking your family for a holiday and just attending the ceremony and then heading back to your family but then I read that your kids will be devastated if their cousins are at the wedding and they are not.  Would it be an option for your sisters kids to hang out with your kids at the resort with your wife and their dad looking after the tribe instead of attending the wedding?\n\nBut no judgement if you decide not to go.  That's what can happen with a destination wedding.  \n\nWe got an invite to my husband's nieces wedding a few years ago.  They were quite close, esp when younger.  We live a long distance from them and where they were having the wedding like 5 or so hours and therefore there was no opportunity to leave the kids at home.  We actually didn't realise that the kids weren't invited (they were like 8, 10 and 12 or something like that... not little but not quite teenagers either and definitely couldn't be left alone to fend for themselves for 2 days including an overnighter).  And only realised about 5 days before the wedding when MIL said that we need to check whether they were invited... never mind in the 3 months leading up to the wedding we had openly discussed the kids coming and where we were staying etc to the SIL who was the mother of the bride multiple times and also to the MIL but no one said anything about the kids not being invited.  I think it was a last minute decision to exclude them.  We were told there were no other kids there but the grooms two (like 8 and 10) and the 2 year old they had together.  \n\nIn the end we went.  We left the kids with my mother and stepdad (really did not want to do this for many reasons and the kids weren't too keen either - one kid we left at my step mom's who is awesome and would rather have left all the kids with her but the kid that was there is neurodivergent and a nightmare to her siblings which wouldn't have been fair to step mom).  We arrived at the wedding. My mind was not really on the wedding as I was stressing more on whether my youngest kids were safe with my mom and we left as early as we could that was acceptable to head back to mom's house.. .and make sure the kids were safe.  It was not an enjoyable wedding for us.\n\nThe issue wasn't that it was a kid free wedding.  That's fine... their choice.  But we were never told until the last minute even though everyone knew the kids were coming so had ample time to say they weren't.\n\nOh and there were a few other kids there... the kids of their friends.  Clearly we weren't high on their priority list.  This is fine... don't use not having kids other than the bride and grooms at the wedding when you are clearly lying.\n\nIf we had've known the deal I wouldn't have gone.  But this was such late notice that we were all organised including time off work and were expected there and the expectation was that we should've known.  And the kids thought they were going and were very disappointed but still wanted to go down with us... and the more I think about it, I should've just sent my apologies with child care as the excuse.", "NTA. Even if he didn't have a child free wedding and you didn't go to his destination wedding you still wouldn't be the asshole.", "I'd definitely start by having the conversation with him and politely clarifying that you actually don't have childcare either, so can you also have the 'childfree' waiver? That would be the way to ensure the most happiness of the most people, I think.", "As per your edit, correct his assumption and see if the tune changes. Maybe he just wasn't really thinking, since he'd heard of your ILs watching the kids before but knew from the get-go that your sister didn't have childcare. \n\nBut if he's reluctant or outright says no to your kids, then of course you're NTA to not go. Traveling is expensive! Destination weddings inevitably mean that some guests may not make it anyway.", "NTA", "NTA- as it goes. Oftentimes, the ruling here is people are able to have whatever specifications for the wedding.  Just the same as it's understood that parents can't go if their kids can't.\n\nIt was rude the way they assumed you had in-laws and child care covered.  Because life don't work that way.\n\nSo if you actually do want to attend the wedding then by all means have conversation.\n\nIf the expense and everything of it you would really just pass on it. Then you just RCP know what the explanation that you have no child care and while You would love to be there. You respect their no child decision and thus it is not an option for you.", "NTA and your brother shouldn't assume you have childcare, and it is one rule for one, one for the other.  Is he aware now that you don't have childcare?\n\nAn invite is a request not an order, you can say no.", "NTA\n\nThis is what people get when they start excluding family members. I don't care if they're kids, they're still part of your family. Even if childcare weren't a problem, I'd still bail on any wedding invite that specifically excluded my kids. Destination weddings are insulting enough, just assuming everybody can and wants to spend a ton of money and vacation days on your \"special day\". To add a no kids rule on top of that, just means you don't care if half your guest list doesn't show. \n\nNo need to pick a fight about it, or even explain why. Just say you can't make it.", "I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re shitty kids yeah. No shade on OP some kids are just shitty to have at a wedding", "My cousin had a destination wedding in a place they love just to keep it small. They both grew up in a small town, were very social but both had relatives on both sides they didn\u2019t want to attend, so it all worked out.", "\"Or put your kids in a daycare, I do that with my pets\"   So pets and kids are in the same category?  What's up with this mindset?  Frankly I believe kids make weddings better, and if you're worried about them disrupting the ceremony, hire a babysitter for the actual wedding, but let them attend the reception.  That's not so bad, is it?  That way it's a family affair, especially since this particular wedding is also a destination ceremony.", "\"We won't have alone time or get out of the house by ourselves for the next 20 years unless **you** make it happen for us \u2014 no pressure\" is a *ton* of pressure.", "NTA. It's an invitation, not a subpoena. You're not required to go.", "NTA.  Especially if they know you don't have child care.  Why is it ok for your sister to have no child care, but not ok for you not to?  I wouldn't go to this wedding if they're playing favorites.", "NTA he can make the rules and exceptions for his wedding. You can choose to attend or not.", "NAH\n\nIt's clear he doesn't realize your situation IMO. Just talk to him.", "It sounds like your brother is assuming that your kids stay home rather than make the trip (but skip the wedding).  If you bring your kids on the trip, there will be no child care unless your in-laws come with you.  That's not reasonable. Your kids come with you or you all stay home might be your options, so let your brother know.  NTA.", "NTA explain it to your brother that like your sister you don't have someone to watch the kids. He may not have understood the situation with your in laws and just leapt to conclusions. that having been said, if he still says no, then there is the out. People set  requirements for a wedding, it is with the understanding that some people may not be able to meet them and so will opt out. you can't meet the 'no kids' rule so sorry, we can't do it.", "NTA. I would tell him that that childcare option does not exist and that it will mean you might not be able to be there. He\u2019s making assumptions that aren\u2019t true. Give him the option to change his mind but if he doesn\u2019t you\u2019re within your rights not to go. It\u2019s not okay to exclude your kids because you have a partner when he\u2019s making an exception for your sister.", "There's really nothing that says, you, my guests, should take on all the costs related to my wedding quite like \"midweek destination wedding, no children allowed.\"\n\nAnyways this is really self centered behavior! NTA.\n\nI'd start the conversation with, why did you assume that my in-laws, who are not close family to you, owe you the favor of several days of overnight childcare midweek? They are not in a position to be granting that extremely generous favor this year.", "Yay, par-tay\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73", "My husbands friend is talking about having his wedding on a cruise ship... it's apparently pretty cheap for them. I have no desire to get on a cruise ship at all.", "I cracked up at that. \ud83e\udd23", "Orrr brother can just not have excluded one set of kids. I mean that\u2019s not to hard.", "I don\u2019t know why people plan destination weddings and then think it will be easy for people who have children to attend. \nIt\u2019s not.", "Cruise ships are floating petri dishes.", "Haha, I can assure you they are not. They've been to weddings before with no problem. My son was even a pageboy that walked down the aisle with the flower girls at a friend's wedding.", "I think there small, and smaller than you expected or hoped for", "Of course! Not saying it\u2019s unacceptable for OP not to attend I was just wondering because they seemed especially upset that an assumption was made that they had childcare. It just seems kind of odd that they never clarified whether they did or did not.\n\nIt made me wonder if OP does have childcare but simply wanted to bring them, which also isn\u2019t the same as  being uncomfortable with childcare options.", "Friend of mine did a destination wedding and kept saying \"what a great deal\" she got, implying it was a discount for the guests.\n\nTurned out we were paying exactly the usual rate, but she got the entire thing for free.

Thanks for that.", "> So pets and kids are in the same category? What's up with this mindset? \n\nI think u/Fatigue-Error was tired and forgot to use the \"/s\".  At least, that's how I read it.", "Yep, my brother and now SIL who both worked at Google at the time of their wedding and who were both making very good money insisted on a destination wedding in the Playa del Carmen and KEPT TELLING US HOW MUCH THEY WERE SAVING. And it was like, don't keep telling us that you're making our family subsidize your choices. My SIL wanted all the bells and whistles (I genuinely am unsure how much my brother wanted them, vs. did not want to pay for the things she wanted and I have not asked because any answer I get will make me more resentful not less), including a \"free\" (to her) cocktail hour and stuff like that. \n\nBut none of it was free. It was just free for them because of the cost their guests paid. It seemed like such a deal to them. Whereas I just kept hearing about how what they wanted, but didn't want to pay for, was going to be funded by the people who scraped together enough to go celebrate them even though it was a hard amount to save (her side is wealthier than ours, it was less of a concern for her invitees). \n\nAnd it's not even like they didn't have the money to fund their dream wedding. But she wanted that money available to buy a house or something fun like that. \n\nDestination weddings where guest costs cover wedding expenses are the epitome of wanting to have your cake and eat it too (while someone else pays for it).", "And that's when I take my gift back", "In this instance, I would have boycotted the whole wedding on principle (and because I was a grad student living on a small stipend at the time), but my parents wanted me there and paid my way. They also signed my name on the present they gave, so this cost me very little in terms of cash. \n\nCost me a lot in terms of respect for my brother and SIL though.", "I mean, 20 years is a bit of a stretch, unless OP has more children. That said, I generally agree with you. It does not seem healthy to have NO backup options for childcare for the next 10 or so years, not only for date nights, etc., but emergencies."]}
