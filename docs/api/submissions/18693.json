He knew they were the packaging for my pads because he had seen them before and quite outraged, he asked whether my used pads were also in that bag. \n\nI told him yes and he dropped the bag, calling me disgusting and telling me to take out the trash myself.\n\nI did, but then asked him where else I should\u2019ve put my pads and he told me I could\u2019ve just kept them in my purse until I got home. \nI\u2019m staying at his place for three nights because we both have some time off, and I wasn\u2019t going to keep my used pads in my bag for days on end (imagine the smell\u2026).\n\nHe stated that he didn\u2019t want my blood all over his trash and that I should find another way to dispose my pads asap.\nI don\u2019t think my attempt of an explanation why period blood isn\u2019t as disgusting as the thinks it is got through to him and he\u2019s quite set on his opinion.\n\nI think he was a bit childish because I don\u2019t understand how an adult straight man can be so disgusted by period blood, but when I texted my brother (19M) about it, he sided with my boyfriend.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been outnumbered, I wanted to see whether other people also believe what I did was an AH move.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Used pads are supposed to be wrapped and put in the garbage. They're literally touching nothing but other garbage. He and your brother need to apologize. Also, dump the bf. He's an idiot.\n\nEdited for redundancy", "NTA. He needs to grow up a little and realize it\u2019s just blood. I\u2019d be a little more understanding if he had an issue with blood in general but still. You\u2019re his gf. You have periods. It\u2019s gonna be a thing and he just needs to get over it or not have you stay over I guess", "NTA. It's in the trash, he'll survive taking it out. The pads won't suddenly develop sentience and stage an organized siege on your bf.", "NTA. \n\nPlease run. Seriously. This guy does not respect women. \n\nHe will not be there for you when cramps hit so hard you can\u2019t move. He won\u2019t be willing to add pads to his grocery run when you have run  out and just started bleeding. He is gonna FREAK when you get blood on the sheets when you start bleeding at night unexpectedly.\n\nImagine trying to have a baby with this guy. All the horrible and disgusting things your body does. Do you really want to have this emotional labor to do through every little thing? \n\nPlease dump this immature child", "You need to run girl. Nta", "NTA. There are so many red flags here. Period blood is the only blood that is not a result of violence or injury. It\u2019s not gross. You need to dump him; he\u2019s not going to change his mind.", "Your bf and your brother are immature and they are the reason we need sex education from a young age. \n\nYour period is not disgusting and he thinks that then he should stop dating women all together. \n\nNTA but these boys are.", "Dump him. \n\nIf he\u2019s THIS immature over menstrual products he has no business being near or in a relationship with someone who has a vagina. Who knows what else he\u2019s going to be a big whiny baby about. \n\nNTA at all.", "No. this boyfriend and your brother. Omg, use tampons and flush them down the toilet. F-in ahole. My husband is a wonderful man and not some boy, god. I\u2019ve never even had to have this conversation. Imagine if he went in your purse and found bloody pads, he would call you an animal. I be throwing my dirty ass pad right on the front porch. I might save them up and decorate the outside. It\u2019d be like Halloween", "If be can't handle pads, he doesn't get to touch a vagina. Both he and your brother are not ready for relationships. NTA. Dump him.", "NTA. Dump him on the curb with the trash bags of pads and go find yourself a man to date, not a quivering misogynist baby", "This is one of those things that comes up quite often on AITA. I think we are all agreed that if you wrap them up carefully and place them in the trash then that's OK.\n\nHoney, if he us disgusted by parts of your woman's body then he shouldn't get to have your body. Put HIM in the trash. \n\nNTA", "Break up with him. He is too immature to have a girlfriend if he is too immature to deal with their periods.", "I'm guessing he's not mature enough for you. No way should a woman feel animosity in any form due to her period. You were considerate enough to wrap and dispose of cleanly. Many women don't so you're ahead there already.", "So where does he dump his used condoms?\n\nIf they are lucky, both your brother and boyfriend will have live in girlfriends/wives/daughters. Do they expect them to keep a separate, special trashcan for used pads? Did their mothers do that? \n\nThey need to grow up. If wrapped properly, used pads won't kill them.", "NTA. You should not allow any guy access to your vagina if they can't handle a basic female bodily function. Don't let these ignorant boys make you feel bad for something totally normal. \n\nAlso,, if you were dating this guy because he's older and more mature than guys your age well... he's not.", "NTA\n\nLike at all, as a 22 M myself I grew up in house with my mum and younger sisters. It's just a part of a healthy cycle that happens to all women. It's not like you were being unhygenic and leaving them laying around the bathroom. Your brother is immature and your boyfriend more so.\n\nSeems like he was raised wrong and I hope his mother would be ashamed of how he treated you. Don't waste your time on petty insecure little boys like him. \n\nOnly 3 months in and I'd say he's well within his probationary period and if you were my little sister I'd tell you to drop him like a hot spud.\n\nLook after yourself and never be ashamed for being healthy, considerate and clean.", "What the hell? NTA! keeping them in your bag is so unhygienic and absolutely barbaric that he thinks that's okay to ask that of you. I've been with my partner for over 7 years and he doesn't even bat an eyelid if I leak on the bedsheets, I've changed pads and tampons in front of him and again he doesn't even bat an eyelid. I would really reconsider your relationship, he sounds like an ass.", "NTA \n\nI would laugh right in his face if he suggested/demanded I should keep dirty pads in my purse, and FOR 3 DAYS. \n\nIf he doesn't have the maturity to deal with a goddamn period pad (wrapped in the trash!! He doesn't need even to see the blood), he doesn't have the maturity to deal with anything else in a relationship, throw him out.", "NTA\n\nNext time he comes to your place, tell him he can't pee in your bathroom and that you don't want his urine all over your bathroom because it's gross. He can pee in a bottle and take it back to his bathroom.", "NTA but if he's too immature for periods, he's too immature for sex.\n\nSimple as that.", "NTA. And you need to break up with him.", "NTA. It's trash. It goes in the trash. Why does he care what his trash is mixing with? That makes no sense. None. \"I don't want your wrapped menstrual blood all over my earwax and shitpaper.\" How does that make any sense?\n\nYou might want to rethink this relationship. You're young. He's old enough to not react this way to something that every woman he dates is going to be going through. You don't deserve to have to deal with someone giving you shame, actual SHAME over this.", "Nta so he's fine with sticking his dick in you and you deal with his fluids but a pad in a garbage can is to gross?  Dump his immature ass.", "NTA\n\nIt's a 100% normal human function and something you don't discriminate against someone for, much less your partner.\n\nGuy sounds like he's 12 or something with his reactions to these things.\n\n>He stated that he didn\u2019t want my blood all over his trash and that I should find another way to dispose my pads asap\n\nThis is absurd - the only reason he even _knew_ is because he twigged about the wrappers!\n\n>but when I texted my brother (19M) about it, he sided with my boyfriend.\n\nI mean, I'm not sure what to say here but your brother is just as immature here and both need to grow the F up.\n\nIf your partner is old enough to have a GF who stays over and, presumably do more than just _kiss and hold hands_ he shouldn't be so pick-and-choosey over which bodily fluids are suddenly \"ok\" and which ones are \"ick\".\n\nIf he can't build up a mature and at least semi-adult way of accepting the realities of being a human female, perhaps having a GF isn't for him?", "NTA \n\nIf this is how he reacts to normal bodily functions throw the whole boyfriend away.", "I already said NTA but I also want to notice that you are only 18 and probably not super experienced. This is a learning experience, a painful one but you will howl with laughter about this in ten years as you recount to friends and struggle to remember this guys name I bet. \n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of RED FLAGS. If not, they are things that potential or current significant others do that are signals that they won\u2019t  make good partners. Many female bodies people are socialized to ignore red flags because we believe that 1)we don\u2019t deserve better treatment or 2) that we can change someone. \n\nI\u2019m 41 and one thing I\u2019ve learned over my life is that it is REALLY important to listen what people show you or tell you about themselves. And while we can hope people change and grow, we have to take people as they are and decide whether we can partner with them as is, rather than with some idealized future version of them we are hoping for. \n\nThere are also GREEN FLAGS, which are signals that a person will be a great partner. Those are also good to look for!! \n\nI hope you come thru this more committed to yourself and what is best for you.", "23 and 18\n\n23/2 = 12 \n\n12+ 7 = 19\n\nDump him, 23 year olds shouldn\u2019t be dating 18 year olds, this is is just the first example that he sucks, there will be more", "Your mistake was throwing out the pad but forgetting to throw out your boyfriend.", "Yes this! Please put him in the trash. Get yourself an adult boyfriend. \nWomen\u2019s bodies are not gross. Imagine him having daughters with him behaving like this. \n\nNTA", "NTA this is response I would expect from toddler, not 23 year old guy. Imagine being pregnant and OP's water breaks, I can see him making OP clean it before going to the hospital. Man is not ready to have a woman in his life.", "NTA \n\n100% agree, you should support your partner not put them down for basic body functions", ">NTA.  If he cant make your vagina welcome in his apartment I think your vagina should go elsewhere.\n\nI thought it came from the sloughing off of extra tissue of the uterine wall in preparation for the next cycle? Isn't the vagina just the pathway? And if OP's boyfriend is so disgusted by what goes on there, should he even be around a body part he finds so traumatic? I wonder if OP's boyfriend has insurance so he can get some help to figure out why female body parts and what they do are so frightening to him. Maybe OP should give him so space so he can feel safe again?\n\n;-)", "This is the best! I laughed so hard.", "Well said!!! I mean the bathroom trash more than likely has used tissues someone blew their nose into. Bathroom trash is generally full of human secretions. He\u2019s a loser. Dump him!!! NTA!", "Best response. This dude's behavior is an embarrassment.", "That was quite the visual but ty lmfao", "Haha she should frame a used pad and leave it as a break up gift.", ">NTA  \n>  \n>Dude is he a 13 year old boy? You even wrapped them before throwing them away. He needs to grow up. Your brother is an AH too for siding with him. It\u2019s fluffling trash for Pete sakes.\n\nLOL My 13 year old son does not behave this way and he's a pretty typical kid.", "My 9 year old is more mature.", ">NTA  \n>  \n>Only an asshole would expect you to carry garbage around in your purse for days rather than sully his pristine trash can with it. \ud83d\ude44\n\nHe probably almost never empties it. LOL", "You hit the nail on the head! Two of them reek of ignorance and bigotry. And besides it is trash. I guess if he is so invested in his trash he belongs there.\n\nNta", ">No the man needs to get a grip.\n\nEssentially his social life once OP gets a clue and finds someone who isn't scared of women's reproductive systems.", ">No the ~~man~~ kid needs to get a grip.\n\nI've corrected your typo, I hope you don't mind.", "'Icky poo girl blood' - must not touch it! /s", ">that is a huge red flag.\n\npun intended?", "Not even boys. My child makes zero fuss about periods and used pads because we've normalized it.", "You don't use your bin? It's not just for pads...", "Bruh, it's five years. I'd argue that a 23 year old shouldn't be hooking up with an 18 year old, yeah. But those are both relatively normal college ages that would run in similar circles. It's not like he's 40.", "Those people shouldn\u2019t date someone who menstruates then", "To some childish men**\n\nfixed it for you. \n\nIt\u2019s a fucking trash can\u2026 for trash. Who gives af. It was wrapped up, not like she left it open for everyone to see.\n\nOP NTA.", "Yea I am sure he is more mature than this dingle hopper.\n\nBut I\u2019d expect it more out of a young kid than a grown ass man. He obviously was never taught that it really isn\u2019t a big deal.", "It's not JUST for pads. It is a bin after all.\n\n\nBut there's a reason why the bathroom specifically has a tiny bin and that reason isn't \"incase you find a sweet wrapper in your pocket while you're on the loo\"", "I think we're specifically talking about their 5 year old age gap not someone in their 40ties", ">To some childish men\\*\\*  \n>  \n>fixed it for you.  \n>  \n>It\u2019s a fucking trash can\u2026 for trash.

One literally was a mom. It really boggles my mind how some people can remain so willfully ignorant in the Information Age.", "I mean, I\u2019d have an issue if it was an open pad dropped on top of the trash for everyone to see, but when it\u2019s wrapped up it\u2019s no different from any other piece of trash in there.", ">I mean, I\u2019d have an issue if it was an open pad dropped on top of the trash for everyone to see, but when it\u2019s wrapped up it\u2019s no different from any other piece of trash in there.\n\nI know, right? And it's not an issue when the bathroom trash is emptied in a reasonable amount of time.", "I\u2019m just flabbergasted at the suggestion to keep 3 days worth of pads in her purse tbh, does my guy not realise how bad that would stink out his place lmaooo"]}
