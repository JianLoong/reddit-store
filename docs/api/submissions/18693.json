The trashcan has a lid and there\u2019s a plastic garbage bag in there, so the pad was touching nothing but the trash that was already inside. \n\nI genuinely didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, until my boyfriend took out the trash this morning and noticed the plastic wrappers in the bag. He knew they were the packaging for my pads because he had seen them before and quite outraged, he asked whether my used pads were also in that bag. \n\nI told him yes and he dropped the bag, calling me disgusting and telling me to take out the trash myself.\n\nI did, but then asked him where else I should\u2019ve put my pads and he told me I could\u2019ve just kept them in my purse until I got home. \nI\u2019m staying at his place for three nights because we both have some time off, and I wasn\u2019t going to keep my used pads in my bag for days on end (imagine the smell\u2026).\n\nHe stated that he didn\u2019t want my blood all over his trash and that I should find another way to dispose my pads asap.\nI don\u2019t think my attempt of an explanation why period blood isn\u2019t as disgusting as the thinks it is got through to him and he\u2019s quite set on his opinion.\n\nI think he was a bit childish because I don\u2019t understand how an adult straight man can be so disgusted by period blood, but when I texted my brother (19M) about it, he sided with my boyfriend.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been outnumbered, I wanted to see whether other people also believe what I did was an AH move.\n\nEDIT: typos", "created_utc": 1685624089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xguk1/aita_for_disposing_my_pads_in_my_boyfriends/", "score": 22507, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He knew they were the packaging for my pads because he had seen them before and quite outraged, he asked whether my used pads were also in that bag. \n\nI told him yes and he dropped the bag, calling me disgusting and telling me to take out the trash myself.\n\nI did, but then asked him where else I should\u2019ve put my pads and he told me I could\u2019ve just kept them in my purse until I got home. \nI\u2019m staying at his place for three nights because we both have some time off, and I wasn\u2019t going to keep my used pads in my bag for days on end (imagine the smell\u2026).\n\nHe stated that he didn\u2019t want my blood all over his trash and that I should find another way to dispose my pads asap.\nI don\u2019t think my attempt of an explanation why period blood isn\u2019t as disgusting as the thinks it is got through to him and he\u2019s quite set on his opinion.\n\nI think he was a bit childish because I don\u2019t understand how an adult straight man can be so disgusted by period blood, but when I texted my brother (19M) about it, he sided with my boyfriend.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been outnumbered, I wanted to see whether other people also believe what I did was an AH move.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m assuming he wants to have sex with you, but he just doesn\u2019t want to know anything about how your body works. He is disgusted by the thing that created him and gave him life. This man likes the idea of you he has created in his head, but you being a real, breathing, living person is too much for him. You deserve better. \n\nAlso, wait until he finds out that you also poop!!", "This comment is hilarious. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\n>How special is his trash? Does he dig through it with his tongue while blindfolded?", "I can only imagine if they would eventually live together she would have to hide her pads and other \"lady items\" because they are \"shameful\".", "His reaction would absolutely be a deal breaker for me. Keep them in her purse til she gets home?! That is disgusting just like him. NTA", "1000% this. What a child - dump him ASAP.", "OMG, dump this child masquerading as a man. Seriously.", "100% this. That guy is a complete clown.", "Throw the whole man away (metaphorically)", "Honestly.  What an asshole.  OP don't waste anymore time on him.  He's immature, selfish, and a drama queen.", "100% yes OP us dating an immature boy, not a man", "As a dude. Wtf? Red flag. Dump him.", "Get you a man that was raised right and cares for you during your period; it helps if he's ok with period s\\*x, it helps with cramps.", "The man \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. he is DISGUSTING", "NTA, but I'm a vampire.", "I\u2019m a man and this behavior is unacceptable. This boy and I mean boy, views you and women in general as lesser than. It\u2019s not debatable. This is the tip of the iceberg. Also your brother is a moron as well. This guy won\u2019t take out sealed trash wrapped in paper that is certainly dry now, how can you expect him to take care of you when you really need it?", "I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this man has a disgust for women that goes deeper than pad disposal. Why would you want to be with someone who is disgusted by you and shames you for a bodily function that every woman has? Run.", "OP you're 18 dating someone 5 years older than you who's less mature than an actual 5 year old. Please dump this loser.", "NTA; both your bf and brother are immature idiots.", "This man is not ready to be in a relationship with a woman. He and your 19 yr old brother are not the experts on healthy relationship dynamics you seem to think they are. He's shown you everything you need to see to realize he is trash, dump him.", "NTA. I\u2019m a guy and there should be no issue with pads in the trash. What is he gonna expect when he actually lives with a woman? It\u2019s a biological function, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s malicious. He\u2019s being stupid and you should dump him for being this childish.", "Call his mum. Then put him in the trash.", "WTF? NTA. If he is not apologising by now I hope you find the strength to dump him and find another person who at least respects you.", "Your brother clearly needs a talking to as well", "NTA. Dump that boy and find a man", "No offense to your brother, but it is idiotic that he is siding with your boyfriend (although I hope he will soon be your ex-boyfriend). NTA.", "Tell him if he isn\u2019t mature enough for a grown woman to spend the night at his house  on her period then he definitely isn\u2019t mature enough for a sexual relationship. Out of blood piss or poop I would rather have blood on me.", "NTA and you should absolutely break up with him. Inexcusable behavior from a \u201cman.\u201d I really hope you read these comments and take this seriously.", "Dump his ass. NTA", "Yup\nIf he can't handle the trash, there's no way he will react well to bed stains, stained underwear, being asked to buy period products for you, etc.\n\nIn my opinion, being supportive and mature about all of those things is a pre-requisites to a relationship with someone who menstruates.\n\nWill he also make you clean up your own puke when you are sick?\n\nAlso.\nIs this attitude common where you are from?\nI've never met a man with a more unreasonable response to the proper disposal of trash.", "NTA and dump his ass. A man who is this disgusted about your blood doesn't have any business being in your pants on other days.", "Dump him. That's sexist as fuck, and he is a fucking child if he can't handle trash in his trash.\n\nNTA. Dont ever be ashamed of your period", "NTA\n\nI could excuse a 14 year-old boy getting grossed out by pads, but your boyfriend is 23, he needs to grow up and understand that part of dating a woman is that, occasionally, she's gonna have periods and need to dispose of used pads and tampons in his bathroom trash.", "What a fucking baby. Dump him.", "Throw this man along with those pads in the trash can.\nHe\u2019s the AH \n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. I feel like you're the only one in the story who's not a child.", "NTA please dump him lol the age gap is already weird and then he acts childish about something natural and normal when he\u2019s 5 years older than you \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. i'm a man and i will never understand some guys' shitty, horrible attitude about period stuff. absolutely ridiculous. i'm sorry you went through this. your BF is the gross one in this situation, not you.", "NTA. Every good pirate is willing to brave the red seas. Date a good pirate.", "The only disgusting thing is your boyfriends attitude towards women.\n\nGet rid of that childish goon.", "NTA. \n\nDo your boyfriend & brother think periods are like the lift scene from the Shining? Immature AF.", "NTA. Dump your bf asap. If he\u2019s *that* grossed out by periods there\u2019s something seriously wrong. \n\nTrust me, there\u2019s plenty of men out there that won\u2019t give a flying fuck which garbage you put your pads in.", "NTA - and I\u2019m a dude. He sounds like a child, not an adult.  When you are in a couple you better get used to bodily fluids and all sorts of sounds that your SO does.  This is even more concerning as a red flag for anything that may happen in the future between you two.  Tell him to grow up - and your brother too.", "NTA. Dump him and tell him he\u2019d better get himself a boyfriend if he doesn\u2019t want to deal with menstrual cycles! What a prick.", "YTA to yourself if you stay with him", "Wow, a grown ass man being disgusted and horrified by periods. Absolutely pathetic."]}
