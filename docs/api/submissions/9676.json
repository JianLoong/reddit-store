So I followed up with my daughter with her class photo and I told her to point to all the girls that were invited and wouldn\u2019t you know it\u2026they were all white. So to further investigate my notions I decided to look up lily\u2019s parents FB and I seen quite a few problematic post. So to me the decision became final my daughter wasn\u2019t going. I decided to call my friend who was also parent and I asked her did her daughter get invited to lily\u2019s birthday and she told me no.

Of course lily\u2019s mom found out and she Facebook messaged me and she asked if I can move the party since 2 of the girls who were originally going to lily\u2019s told them they couldn\u2019t make it but instead their coming to our party. I then came up with a lie that I can\u2019t move it and it\u2019s non- refundable. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel bad because I never want to ruin a child\u2019s birthday party so should I just cancel it or should I continue to make my point.

So I\u2019m asking you guys AITA?\n\nEdit: their are 13 girls in my daughters class, 8 of these girls are white ( including my daughter)  the other 5 are POC that was NOT invited. so don\u2019t come in saying I\u2019m over reacting when I evidence is clear as day. And also don\u2019t come in and say \u201c well lily might just of been close with those 8 girls\u201d I can\u2019t speak for those other girls but my daughter never told me about lily until this party fiasco and she never hung with her outside of school. Also I wouldn\u2019t of been doing all of this if my friend ( the one I\u2019m planning it with who\u2019s arabic) wasn\u2019t upset\u2026I presented her with the information and she was pissed and hurt about everything I said to her. she opened up to me and told me when she was kid it was hard for her because she was a practicing muslim plus 9/11 happened when she was in the 3rd grade and no one wanted to be friends with her nor invited to parties..so she was obviously was hurt that this is happening to her daughter in 2023. it may have been wrong but I just felt like I needed to do something to make it right. Also apologies it\u2019s Arab not Arabic  \u2026So yes I will be an asshole for this \n\n\n\n(also let me add I feel like it isn\u2019t my place to determine if something is racist or not because me and my daughter are as like white as they come and I\u2019m still having trouble to how I tell her about this.. but I just feel like this situation left a really bad taste in my mouth and I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving my daughter in the car of someone with such prejudice views plus my daughter never hangs with lily and this would of been her first time hanging out outside of school .)", "created_utc": 1676102189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zfmnk/aita_for_organizing_a_sleepover_for_my_daughter/", "score": 3089, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wonder whether your daughter should befriend her, but also invite her to things with the kids she said \u201caren\u2019t the same\u201d so that Lily can actually get to know them and see that they in fact are.

One of two things can happen.  Either they have fun and she examines her parents\u2019 point of view.

So our boys get the benefit of both of our perspectives. And my husband definitely had far more conversations about race as a mixed kid in the 80s than I did as a white kid. We are also teaching them to recognize their privilege, because while they are mixed from their dad, they look white, so that is how the world will see them. Our oldest niece was asked by friends why she cared about BLM and she said a) you don't have to be black to support black people and b) \"let me tell you about my dad's family\".\n\nSome of the stuff my husband has told me he heard from his family members as a kid just floors me sometimes.", "The problem is they'll just deny it, clean up their FB page, and make excuses.

Yes a call to the parents would have been direct at calling it out and maybe seeing if it was an oversight. However, living in the South and having heard exactly those child's words more than once, i know how useless this is. Most people with these attitudes deep down don't change their beliefs, so social pressure is about the only thing that helps them at least keep it to themselves. \n\nYears ago when i visited relatives in the South, they and their friends never expressed racist attitudes, I assumed they weren't racist, that the South had changed. However, once i moved here and especially as things changed with Trump's election, they felt much freer to express nasty comments directly to me. I do call it out every time. I was shocked that these people almost all turned out to be racists. I can't even begin to list the number of times, the different situations this happened in. I believe it's because they all think it's fine to express those beliefs again. \n\nSo no, i think OP is handling this exactly right. Whether this is in the South or not.

Did you deliberately misspell that? I literally didn't see what you did there, except spelling it wrong. I actually thought at first you were saying something in French.", "My dad was racist but so many of my friends were Black, and I just wanted to be friends with nice kids, that's all. That was my criteria. If you're kind and good and can behave yourself then you would be a good friend. I still remember one White girl who lied about being allergic to milk because she didn't want to have to drink it when we were all visiting a mutual friend. That girl was a nasty piece of work all around and no provocation, she was just a mean kid. She gave me the finger once and told me \"sit on it and rotate\" and she was about 10 years old at the time. This was in the late 70s. She was in my class but NOT my friend.", "But sometimes you have to pick your battles, too. Like say the mask issue with covid. Is going after people for putting others at risk and not wearing masks (especially at doctor's offices, infusion centers and such where a lot of more vulnerable people go) going to educate them and change them? They will just fight back and say how they have no obligation to care about anyone but themselves. (That's why we lost over a million lives in the US alone.) \n\nHow many people during covid also kept quiet and did not defend the vulnerable? How many people were too happy to ignore covid and pretend everything was ok again? \n\nIf putting on a mask at a doctors office (people didn't even do it BEFORE the pandemic when they were coughing all over the waiting room) is JUST TOO HARD, then racism isn't going to be something they can possibly take the tiniest step to battle. They're just too selfish.", "btw what do we do when we are White people without privilege i.e. a mixed race person who is half White and half Black but has White features and light skin? what then? Do you teach the child they should be ashamed of their \"privilege\" or that they can be part of the culture of POC? it seems extremely alienating and political.", "For little kids I would say that we don't leave anyone out who is a nice kid and a friend, that's all. We include everyone as long as they are nice and respectful kids. Simple. You don't have to give a little kid a massive race lesson, they will just tune it out if it's not on their level anyway. I think lilly knows instinctively what is right and wrong.", "She told OPs daughter to her face with no shame.  Yes she was taught it and unfortunately she has internalized and will have to unlearn those behaviors.  However age does not give her a pass", "Yes, I have and what they understand is action and consequences.  Lily and her family will have gotten the message loud and clear.  Racist are allowed to move about in our society with nothing more than a bad boy speech and it doesn\u2019t move the needle.  Actions do move the needle.", "If they were a year or two younger, yours would definitely be the best option. But 8 year olds can handle a little more nuance like was included in what I said. Eight is old enough to understand what a bully is and that while Lilly's parents are trying to teach her to be a bully like them, it doesn't necessarily make Lilly a bad kid and OP's daughter shouldn't purposely exclude Lilly as long as she isn't being mean to their classmates.", "This is the issue for me, she did it with the intention of making a little girl cry because no one comes to her party.", "not really. the racist parents are ruining their 8 year olds party. if you do racist stuff, people will react. I 100% see this as the racist parents fault. dont want stuff like this to happen, plain and simple, dont be racist. i do feel bad for the little girl, her parents are really failing her.", "Yeah OP is being a coward not admitting she meant to ruin the party. She wanted the little girl to suffer and for that op, YTA", "Yes!  That\u2019s my perspective as well. Many commenters are focusing on her making a stand against racism. But they fail to see that taking it out on a child doesn\u2019t really make her much better. She had an opportunity to make a huge statement:  my child is not coming to the party for obvious reasons. But I\u2019m going to have another party a week later and the entire class is invited, including your child, and the whole class can experience what it\u2019s like to accept everyone for who they are.", "Wow. This is my first time going against the grain. \n\nI think this is an absolutely immature way to handle this situation. You should have told those racists off and voiced your concerns with the school and other parents. Throwing a party is great too, but throwing the party on the same day as a little 8 year old girl's party is uncalled for. Her parents are the AHs and should be punished accordingly.  An 8 year old girl wanting to celebrate her bday is not.  It's not her fault that her parents suck. Although I think her party would have been cancelled after revelations of her family's social views were brought to light, throwing this big awesome inclusivity party on the same day is just in poor taste. You can really have it any other day and use it to spread awareness in the community. \n\nI do applaud you for not ignoring the issue. You could have easily declined and stayed silent. I hope things turn out okay.\n\nEDIT: I read many comments saying that the 5 non white girls are victims here and I want to say that that's nonsense. Those racist white people are not obligated to open their house to everyone. They have a right to throw a party and invite who they want. You have a right to decline. You also have a the right to throw a revenge party on the same day. Personally, I would not be hurt if I wasn't invited to a party of someone I wasn't cool with. I would be hurt of some one purposely threw a party on the same day as my party in order to pull attendees away.  Saying this as a non white girl who was bullied and ostracized due to her ethnic background in elementary school.", "i think that your decisions and plan are entirely justified, but if you actually want to combat racism and be actively ANTI racist, you should be straightforward. \n\nyour actions right now fall more on the side of petty rather than productive. \n\ni think that you should absolutely tell the other parent exactly what your thought process is, and have a frank conversation with your daughter about it too. if Black/Brown kids are old enough to experience racism, your kid is old enough to learn about it.", "So you were perfectly \"on board for her to go\" on a sleepover at 8 years old with a classmate that you have never heard of before? And your only problem is that they may have been/ were excluding non-white people?\n\nAre you fking mad!?!? So your anti racist, woke, virtue signalling is more important than your actual daughter. Maybe deal with your daughters safety, then deal with systemic racism.\n\nESH", "\"I'm sorry, the stuff for our party is nonrefundable and can't be changed. Have fun at your Klan rally though\""]}
