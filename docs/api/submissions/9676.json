So I followed up with my daughter with her class photo and I told her to point to all the girls that were invited and wouldn\u2019t you know it\u2026they were all white. So to further investigate my notions I decided to look up lily\u2019s parents FB and I seen quite a few problematic post. So to me the decision became final my daughter wasn\u2019t going. I decided to call my friend who was also parent and I asked her did her daughter get invited to lily\u2019s birthday and she told me no. Which I already assumed she didn\u2019t because she is Arabic.\n\n\nI told her everything i discovered and we came up with a plan to have a party the same exact day but to great wolf lodge and we invited everyone in the class.  Of course lily\u2019s mom found out and she Facebook messaged me and she asked if I can move the party since 2 of the girls who were originally going to lily\u2019s told them they couldn\u2019t make it but instead their coming to our party. I then came up with a lie that I can\u2019t move it and it\u2019s non- refundable. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel bad because I never want to ruin a child\u2019s birthday party so should I just cancel it or should I continue to make my point.

So I\u2019m asking you guys AITA?\n\nEdit: their are 13 girls in my daughters class, 8 of these girls are white ( including my daughter)  the other 5 are POC that was NOT invited. so don\u2019t come in saying I\u2019m over reacting when I evidence is clear as day. And also don\u2019t come in and say \u201c well lily might just of been close with those 8 girls\u201d I can\u2019t speak for those other girls but my daughter never told me about lily until this party fiasco and she never hung with her outside of school. Also I wouldn\u2019t of been doing all of this if my friend ( the one I\u2019m planning it with who\u2019s arabic) wasn\u2019t upset\u2026I presented her with the information and she was pissed and hurt about everything I said to her. So yes I will be an asshole for this.\n\n\n\n(also let me add I feel like it isn\u2019t my place to determine if something is racist or not because me and my daughter are as like white as they come and I\u2019m still having trouble to how I tell her about this.. but I just feel like this situation left a really bad taste in my mouth and I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving my daughter in the car of someone with such prejudice views plus my daughter never hangs with lily and this would of been her first time hanging out outside of school .)", "created_utc": 1676102189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zfmnk/aita_for_organizing_a_sleepover_for_my_daughter/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love your story as a wicked fantasy, though.  But a better move would be to invite EVERY girl on a different day, and have a truly inclusive party.  Lily\u2019s parents would have to deal with their daughter potentially not going when all other girls \u201clike her\u201d did.", "ESH... kind more TAH.

It doesn't sound like they had that many guests invited.\n\nYou then had to lie to cover for the plan to ruin a kid's birthday. All this could have been avoided by declining the invitation, and having her best friend spend the night, and you could have arranged a really great sleepover.

But at the same time if the kids changed their mind and want to come to yours instead that\u2019s saying something too.\n\nI do feel sorry for Lily though, racism is not inherent, and growing up in a home like that can\u2019t be good for her. I wonder whether your daughter should befriend her, but also invite her to things with the kids she said \u201caren\u2019t the same\u201d so that Lily can actually get to know them and see that they in fact are.

You\u2019re an awesome mama.", "NTA! Stick with your plan, it is the right thing to do. I like your calling it out this way.

Presumably, inviting the entire class means you also invited the little girl whose birthday it was, and if I was an 8 year old girl who suddenly realized she had the chance to go from small house party to giant super fun party, I'd be THRILLED.

Are the teachers and principles supposed to teach them how to be decent people? What's socially right and wrong? I think that's more the parents job, and one best taught by example. As in \"See kids, this is how you should deal with racism and bigotry. You don't back down, you don't just shrug and try to just be nice and let it continue. You loudly and publicly denounce it. Every time.\"\n\nThe \"Let's not make waves\" attitude is how crap like this becomes systemic in the first place", "Is there really no way to attack racists except through attacking their children?", "Jeeez there's no fall back or compromise for racism at any level...NIP IT IN THE BUD.\n\n\n\nWhen the girl is being nurtured as a racist that's what happens..boo hoo fetch me the tiniest violin...admire the mother who took a stance called it out and had a party for her own beautiful daughter.  She's a hero", "You may be seeing it as it is, but we would have a very different response.  If my child was invited to a party that appeared to exclude children based on skin color, I would reach out directly to the parents as uncomfortable as it was to find out more and clearly state my values and why my child won\u2019t be attending.\n\nYou called a friend to see if her daughter was invited (so yes, talking to other parents!) and then decided to throw a last minute party at a water park at the same time instead of getting any sort of clarification.  Don\u2019t address the issue, just throw money around and lure children to your party because you are at a water park.\n\nParents in other classrooms, per your post, have taken issue with your party.  If they do know that it was based on you thinking someone was excluded because of race, that\u2019s bad because you are spreading an assumption and not being mature and going straight to the source.  If they don\u2019t know why you are throwing this party at the same time as another girls birthday party, that is also bad because you look like you are causing drama and ruining a child\u2019s birthday by specifically throwing a bigger and better party, and unfortunately you won\u2019t feel the fallout from that, your daughter and the other little girl will.", "Are you saying she shouldn't let the principle know what the teacher is doing? You are literally making no sense by saying you should be loud while also not being loud about it? Tf. She should even go to the teacher and demand why they didn't enforce it? Let them know what is also happening? Be loud but also not let anyone know what is going on. Smart.", "And on another level why would she even waste a second thinking of the racist family ever..they showed their true white colour..ha"]}
