So I followed up with my daughter with her class photo and I told her to point to all the girls that were invited and wouldn\u2019t you know it\u2026they were all white. So to further investigate my notions I decided to look up lily\u2019s parents FB and I seen quite a few problematic post. So to me the decision became final my daughter wasn\u2019t going. I decided to call my friend who was also parent and I asked her did her daughter get invited to lily\u2019s birthday and she told me no.

Of course lily\u2019s mom found out and she Facebook messaged me and she asked if I can move the party since 2 of the girls who were originally going to lily\u2019s told them they couldn\u2019t make it but instead their coming to our party. I then came up with a lie that I can\u2019t move it and it\u2019s non- refundable. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel bad because I never want to ruin a child\u2019s birthday party so should I just cancel it or should I continue to make my point.

So I\u2019m asking you guys AITA?\n\nEdit: their are 13 girls in my daughters class, 8 of these girls are white ( including my daughter)  the other 5 are POC that was NOT invited. so don\u2019t come in saying I\u2019m over reacting when I evidence is clear as day. And also don\u2019t come in and say \u201c well lily might just of been close with those 8 girls\u201d I can\u2019t speak for those other girls but my daughter never told me about lily until this party fiasco and she never hung with her outside of school. Also I wouldn\u2019t of been doing all of this if my friend ( the one I\u2019m planning it with who\u2019s arabic) wasn\u2019t upset\u2026I presented her with the information and she was pissed and hurt about everything I said to her. So yes I will be an asshole for this.\n\n\n\n(also let me add I feel like it isn\u2019t my place to determine if something is racist or not because me and my daughter are as like white as they come and I\u2019m still having trouble to how I tell her about this.. but I just feel like this situation left a really bad taste in my mouth and I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving my daughter in the car of someone with such prejudice views plus my daughter never hangs with lily and this would of been her first time hanging out outside of school .)", "created_utc": 1676102189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zfmnk/aita_for_organizing_a_sleepover_for_my_daughter/", "score": 1623, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wonder whether your daughter should befriend her, but also invite her to things with the kids she said \u201caren\u2019t the same\u201d so that Lily can actually get to know them and see that they in fact are.

One of two things can happen.  Either they have fun and she examines her parents\u2019 point of view.

Missed opportunity imo", "You are an excellent mom and an excellent ally to your friend. \nTalking about racism is not easy. \nThere are lots of children\u2019s books that may be a great way to approach the idea. \nIt is 100% is an important conversation to have though. \nif your daughter\u2019s friend is old enough to have to deal with racism. Your daughter is old enough to talk about why it is bad. \nGood luck.", "NTA\nInitially I thought maybe you should have just organised something for the girls who were excluded if you were gonna something at all (which was very kind of you). On reflection i realised that that would merely exacerbate the separation between the white kids and the kids of colour. Offering an all inclusive alternative for everyone is a great way to fight. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t just let it go thinking it wasn\u2019t your place/not your fight. Well done. It was a tough situation. You didn\u2019t go in guns blazing making assumptions; you tried to verify your suspicions and came up with a decent solution. I hope your daughter and her friends have fun.

You didn't feel comfortable having your daughter go to this event.  That is reasonable. \n\nYou could have chosen to have it a different night, but since Lily wasn't even close to the birthday girl, I imagine that it is possible that the other two aren't either and that is why they chose your event over the original.", "Nta.

You could have had it earlier or a week or two later, but you chose to have it the same day a 7-8 y/o had her sleepover, and no one showed up. At that age, the messages Lily is absorbing from her parents aren\u2019t her fault, and she doesn\u2019t understand why it\u2019s not okay to say things like \u201cShe\u2019s not like us.\u201d All she\u2019ll see is that no one showed up to her party, which will stay with her for a long time.\n\nYour heart was in the right place, but you punished a second-grader for having racist parents, and that makes you TA.", "I'm going to go with NAH. I can't afford to host the entire SK class. I tell my son to pick 7 classmates and I have no idea who they are.\n\nYou, yourself state you don't know most of the children either. Why can't that knowledge be graced to the other child's parents, too? Most likely they gave their daughter 8 invites in her back pack and let her invite whomever she picks from her class. I would have talked to the parents, let them know how they're coming across, guage their reaction, and then assessed. \n\n\n\nWe're the parents truly racist or did their very young daughter just give invites to classmates that look like her? The first is deplorable, the second gross and in need of education while she's still young. After talking to the parents it'd be clear whether it was intentional...then I'd plan my own party.", "I'm torn. It's not Lily's fault her parents are trash, and sadly, she is the one who will basically pay the price for her parents' hatred. At the same time, the other kids deserved an invite too unless they weren't invited because they didn't get along, but that doesn't seem to be the case.   \n\n\nIdk. I abstain. I hope it all gets resolved, though, and that all of the kids have a nice time and are friends.", "ESH- Lily's parents for being racist, and you for punishing Lily for her parents' invitation choices.", "INFO: the friend is Arab, not Arabic.

The parent may be ostracized", "The amount of people calling OP the AH is really mind boggling! OP is absolutely NTA and good on her for standing up against racism when she saw it.

They care more about the \u201cvictim\u201d then the actual victim. This same applies to CRT being taught in schools, the little white kids are always the victim. It\u2019s exhausting", "I don't feel bad for her because she is missing her birthday. I feel bad for her because she has racist, toxic parents.", "That would create a \"separate but equal\" situation, which is still a damaging form of racism.

Huh??", "In what way is the child being hurt?", "It's not Lily's fault, but she's gonna have to learn the price of placating racist parents. This is a good time for her to learn that it's not ok for her to just accept her parents' racism; that if she doesn't stand up for what's right, then she will have to eat the consequences too. I feel sorry for Lily, but it is better for her in the long run to learn that racism is wrong, and that going along with her parents' racism is not a viable solution for her.", "This is why white people need to be extra vocal about calling it out when we see it, so that POC don't bear the full burden of experiencing it *and* advocating against it. Yeah I might get flak for it in that moment but that's easier to bear because I get to choose my battles and can do so when I have the energy to fight them. POC are subjected to these battles every day and it's understandable if you don't go out of your way to start more.", "I might try calling out the exclusion without ever mentioning race, and let the other mom tell on herself.

They knew the context and reason behind the second party.   Don\u2019t excuse resist behavior. Let\u2019s not pretend that everyone didnt know what and who was invited.  That\u2019s a small class.  Privatel telling the parents is like a slap on the wrist.  They don\u2019t care. \n\nWhat is petty is inviting the majority of your classmates to a party and excluding others because \u201cthey aren\u2019t like you\u201d.  That was petty and calculating to humiliate the other 5 children.  Sorry tables got turned and birthday girl\u2019s family found out they are not invited because they are like them (people who celebrate diversity)", "She was being creative to still allow the other girls have a good time and avoid a toxic situation, while avoiding her daughter to hang out with the toxic family. Not everyone is ready for a full blown confrontation, and that's OK I think \n\nPS - I love a confrontation myself :)", "Not what I implied! I meant that an 8-year old, who just wanted to have a sleepover and probably didn\u2019t have any control over who was and wasn\u2019t invited, is being hurt if her schoolmates don\u2019t show up. It\u2019s completely unfair to the kids who weren\u2019t invited of course, and OP\u2019s response is justified, I just think that it\u2019s sad that a little girl has to pay for her parents\u2019 prejudices.", ">be told by another white child that she can\u2019t come because \u201cshe\u2019s not like us\u201d\n\nExcuse me, WHAT?! I hope you mention this to the parents of the girls who come to your party. There is literally no justification for this.

The amount of times I've seen people acting like crap around him, but is so subtle that you can't really act in the moment.

She also probably doesn't know this is happening because her parents' are glaring racists.", "Sorry I disagree. This was simply a conversation that should have been had. I would not assume anything & I certainly wouldn\u2019t assume for other people. I would ask the questions directly. Why can\u2019t my daughter tell anyone who \u201cisn\u2019t like us\u201d about the party? What exactly does that mean? It appears certain kids were not invited, why? Listen & then explain why your kid will never be attending anything at Lily\u2019s house. I would be very clear about how their behavior is unacceptable & I won\u2019t have an issue letting other parents know. OP had the opportunity to address this directly & she chose to lie about non-refundable stuff. \n\nLily\u2019s parents are potentially racist, not petty. Hosting your own party to show how inclusive you are without addressing the actual root of the problem does nothing to change anyone\u2019s behavior.

Especially during this case.", "It's sad, but it's necessary. It's not OP's fault no one will show up to her birthday party, it is 100% her racist parents' fault. \n\nAlso, kids pay for their parents' flaws/actions all the time. It's sad, but it's not some great injustice that needs to be fixed. It's how kids eventually learn that their parents aren't perfect, and they need to forge their own path to do better.", "That\u2019s the issue though. It most definitely is what you implied. \n\nHow often are POC told to be the bigger person, not get emotional, definitely don\u2019t get angry, think about the impact on the racist\u2026ie carry the emotional labor of not just the racism but the reasonable consequences for the racist because someone was \u201cjust joking, just didn\u2019t know, just wanted a sleepover, is just old and it\u2019s not their fault\u2026\u201d.  All those \u201cjust\u2019s\u201d, those are microagressions. That attitude, lending *more* understanding and sympathy to anyone besides the victims of microagresssions, perpetuates harm. You don\u2019t seem to be intending to perpetuate harm, so decide if your perspective requires some evaluation now that it\u2019s been brought to your attention \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the little girl is most impacted *by her parents\u2019 racism* but that is the **consequence** of harboring bigotry. You\u2019re transferring responsibility of the parents\u2019 actions onto OP. It\u2019s not her, or the kids, consequence to bear. It\u2019s a good lesson for the little girl to see her parents\u2019 actions and the resulting consequences: people don\u2019t want (their kids) to associate with hateful bigots", "The racist mom already knows.", "Birthday girl is part of the reason they were not invited.  8yo are not innocent in this matter.  She likely doesn\u2019t play with them or treats the other poc kids as inferior.", "That's wierd.  I didn't mean to.  Every time I tried to post it gave me an error", "She could push back on why she's not allowed to invite her non-white friends. She could refuse to throw/attend a party where non-white kids are not allowed. She could make a big stink about it and complain to the school about how her parents are being unfair and racist. 8 year olds are able to do this. Lily is not doing this because she doesn't yet have any experiences to teach her that parents are wrong about this. \n\nBased on her comment about \"not allowed to invite her bc she's not like us,\" I would think she does understand her parents are racist, she just hasn't been forced to learn that racism is wrong. People not coming to her party because she capitulated to her parents' racism is the perfect natural consequence. Hopefully OP's actions will create a situation that puts Lily at odds with her parents' racism. This continual application of natural consequences is the best way to prevent Lily from becoming a racist herself.", "First, if the parents are doing and are so blatant that even the child will say it, they have been doing it for a long time and a simple conversation is going to be meaningless.  Plus she doesn\u2019t have to explain anything to this family.  They well get the message loud and clear when they hear who did go to the party.  Now they will experience discrimination on a first hand bases.\n\nWill Lily\u2019s family save face?  No. It will become clear.  This polite discussion one to one with Lilys family works in Disney movies.  Have the party.  The other parents will ask why at the venue and OP can discuss it with those parents and they can chose how to treat Lily\u2019s family from here on out. It seems like two white parents backed out because the rumor mill was in gear telling the truth out party one and party two \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with racist parents who try to weaponize school to hurt POC children.  OP was correct.  She taught her daughter that racism is not okay and it is fine create alternate events.", "It was very common with \u201cbig\u201d outings as a kid.

If these girls are being bullied, rallying behind their children is a valid one many parents would be willing to co-organize.", "The teaching of critical race theory is there for a purpose.  It's not OPs responsibility to parent that racist woman's child. Jeeez all this responsibility on the OP.", "You seriously expect an 8 year old to stand up to her own parents who provide her shelter, food etc.?\n\nThat's so ridiculous I don't even know what to say.", "I did not say OP needed to parent the other child. You said \"why should people educate racists?\" I said \"because it might help the daughter\" and your response is \"teach her critical race theory.\" . . . which is education that can help people see a different world view and not be racist. That's very close to what I said. Not sure why you're agreeing with me and implying I'm wrong at the same time, unless I'm misunderstanding your comment?", "I think it's more ridiculous to assume that the parents would just disown their 8 year old for pushing back on something. Kids push boundaries with parents all the time, only abusive parents would deprive their kid of necessities to ensure compliance. \n\nIt is possible that the racist parents are also child abusers, but assuming that from what's in the post is unreasonable."]}
