So I followed up with my daughter with her class photo and I told her to point to all the girls that were invited and wouldn\u2019t you know it\u2026they were all white. So to further investigate my notions I decided to look up lily\u2019s parents FB and I seen quite a few problematic post. So to me the decision became final my daughter wasn\u2019t going. I decided to call my friend who was also parent and I asked her did her daughter get invited to lily\u2019s birthday and she told me no. Which I already assumed she didn\u2019t because she is Arabic.\n\n\nI told her everything i discovered and we came up with a plan to have a party the same exact day but to great wolf lodge and we invited everyone in the class.  Of course lily\u2019s mom found out and she Facebook messaged me and she asked if I can move the party since 2 of the girls who were originally going to lily\u2019s told them they couldn\u2019t make it but instead their coming to our party. I then came up with a lie that I can\u2019t move it and it\u2019s non- refundable. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel bad because I never want to ruin a child\u2019s birthday party so should I just cancel it or should I continue to make my point.

So I\u2019m asking you guys AITA?\n\nEdit: their are 13 girls in my daughters class, 8 of these girls are white ( including my daughter)  the other 5 are POC that was NOT invited. so don\u2019t come in saying I\u2019m over reacting when I evidence is clear as day. And also don\u2019t come in and say \u201c well lily might just of been close with those 8 girls\u201d I can\u2019t speak for those other girls but my daughter never told me about lily until this party fiasco and she never hung with her outside of school. Also I wouldn\u2019t of been doing all of this if my friend ( the one I\u2019m planning it with who\u2019s arabic) wasn\u2019t upset\u2026I presented her with the information and she was pissed and hurt about everything I said to her. So yes I will be an asshole for this.\n\n\n\n(also let me add I feel like it isn\u2019t my place to determine if something is racist or not because me and my daughter are as like white as they come and I\u2019m still having trouble to how I tell her about this.. but I just feel like this situation left a really bad taste in my mouth and I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving my daughter in the car of someone with such prejudice views plus my daughter never hangs with lily and this would of been her first time hanging out outside of school .)", "created_utc": 1676102189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zfmnk/aita_for_organizing_a_sleepover_for_my_daughter/", "score": 579, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love your story as a wicked fantasy, though.  But a better move would be to invite EVERY girl on a different day, and have a truly inclusive party.  Lily\u2019s parents would have to deal with their daughter potentially not going when all other girls \u201clike her\u201d did.", "ESH... kind more TAH.

All this could have been avoided by declining the invitation, and having her best friend spend the night, and you could have arranged a really great sleepover.

But at the same time if the kids changed their mind and want to come to yours instead that\u2019s saying something too.\n\nI do feel sorry for Lily though, racism is not inherent, and growing up in a home like that can\u2019t be good for her. I wonder whether your daughter should befriend her, but also invite her to things with the kids she said \u201caren\u2019t the same\u201d so that Lily can actually get to know them and see that they in fact are.

You\u2019re an awesome mama.", "NTA! Stick with your plan, it is the right thing to do. I like your calling it out this way.

Presumably, inviting the entire class means you also invited the little girl whose birthday it was, and if I was an 8 year old girl who suddenly realized she had the chance to go from small house party to giant super fun party, I'd be THRILLED.

This was also the incident that made me aware that someone might not like me for my skin color. I wish my parents had better prepared me for it, but they thought I was too young to hear about it. So, you should talk to your daughter. Even though she\u2019s white, it\u2019s better that she learns about it from you than from other children who might already be learning racist beliefs at home.

As a POC I've tried to deal with racism head on by calling it out but 9/10 people say\n\n- of course you'd pull the race card, everyone always assumes it's race, typical\n- you can't assume why I did what I did\n- your the racist if you're mind went there immediately\n\nAnd people who are usually centrist, meaning if there is no evidence of seeing obvious racism outright, ( like a video of someone saying a slur vs micro aggression/passive aggressive like saying omg wow I can't believe they have internet in your country), those centrists take the side of the racists. \n\nHard to fight and it gets exhausting to be fighting an uphill battle. We all can't be revolutionaries or rebels for the cause", "But how do they know who is invited and who isnt? OP is hiding it from them now she's discovered the racism at play. She needs to give them a chance to act.", "This is true. I'm white, but my children are not. It has been so eye opening to my own privilege to experience childhood through their eyes. And what is so infuriating is that other white people in my life will explain away racism my kids experience as 'kids will always be mean, so I'm not sure that's really racism.' It's simply not possible to ignore the meaning and history and society-level implications of racism as a kid experiencing it. All of those things speak to whether a person belongs and belonging is necessary to survival, especially for a child. Kids are smart and they are practicing to be adults. Not engaging with your white child about racism is just letting them practice being able to ignore it as a white adult. And the BIPOC kids have to engage with it now- no choice- just as they will as adults. Not speaking about it perpetuates the status quo.", "This is true. I'm white, but my children are not.

The girl should have the experience of seeing the social implications of having a party that excludes people.", "I like this in theory, but it seems like a terrible idea to let a family of white supremacists have a bunch of vulnerable kids in their home overnight.\n\nIn reality, the parents of the girls who were originally excluded aren\u2019t going to put their kids at risk of being mistreated, so they\u2019ll keep them home. Only (some of) the white parents will feel comfortable participating. And then we\u2019re right back to where we started with a white-only party.

Sometimes a person will do/say something racist just out of ignorance, or because they have internal biases they never examined, and will be genuinely horrified when it\u2019s pointed out to them.\nThese people are worth trying to talk round.\nThis mom OP is dealing with is WAY beyond that. Like she\u2019s trying to segregate 8 year old girls at a birthday party. That\u2019s some 1950s American South level shit.\nNobody who truly believes that an 8 year old kid deserves to be excluded because of her race is going to be converted by a quick \u201ctake a look at your behaviour\u201d.
