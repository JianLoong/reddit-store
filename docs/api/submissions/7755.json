I am white, but I speak pretty fluent Korean. \n\nMy course at uni is a lot of international kids. Most of my friends on the course are Korean, save a couple, and after some awkward interactions and people saying things in front of me that they maybe shouldn't, it's pretty well known on the course that I can speak Korean among the Korean students. They'll come to me or message me if they're having trouble understanding instructions or assignments, and I'm always happy to help. It's good practice and I like being helpful anyways.\n\nOnto the story: this week we've been split up into different workshop days. I went in yesterday (my day) and it was going fine. It was me and maybe 12 other students and two lecturers.\n\nThe main lecturer, a woman we'll call Janet, got on my nerves though. At one point, she called out the girls next to me for being on their phones as she was speaking. They were Chinese and using a live translation app to understand her. When I pointed this out (they were struggling to explain) she just huffed and said \"it's still *very* disrespectful, as I feel like I am speaking slowly and simply enough for you to understand (she wasn't) but I guess I'll allow it.\" Oookay, weird, but whatever.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, we all stuck our work on the walls and Janet went around talking about some different people's work. She stopped on this one girl, Jihyun, and was analysing her work, use of materials, etc. She was speaking quickly, and using long, complicated language. I know Jihyun, she still really struggles to understand English if it's said too quickly. So when the lecturer turned to her and asked her to explain her process, I recognised that lost look in her eyes.\n\nShe was stood on the other side of the group to me, but I heard her say, in Korean, to her friend,\n\n*\"I have no idea what she said, do you?\"* Her friend shook her head, and my lecturer got annoyed and prompted her to start explaining really rudely. So I spoke up, in Korean, and quickly explained what Janet was asking. Like I said, she was across the room, so I kinda got everyones attention when I was speaking to her, but she seemed relieved and thanked me for explaining. As she was answering the question, she'd pause and ask me what a certain word or phrase's translation was. As usual, I was happy to help, and didn't think anything of it until after the workshop ended and Janet pulled me aside.\n\nJ: Just so you are aware, what you did earlier was *extremely* rude.\n\nMe, confused: What?\n\nJ: Talking over the class to that girl in another language, and then hijacking her chance to explain her work to the group. \n\nMe: She was struggling to understand you, so I helped. \n\nJ: I'm sure she could've figured it out on her own.

Half of my job as a paid employee of the school was to re-explain assignment material to ESL students who were the victims of this same kind of linguistic shaming and I couldn't even help them as much as a bilingual student probably could have since I only spoke English and tutored in English so I just had to become really adept at finding phrasings that were easy for ESL students to understand-- which, by the way, is the appropriate response if you're an educator teaching in a single language and not \"I'm already being more than accommodating so shut up\" or whatever the gist of what your professor effectively said was. \n\nAt the very least, you should all leave her a very poor end of semester review if this keeps up.", "Absolutely alert the school!

Especially when moving from \"translating the professor's question so that she can answer\" into \"helping her translate her answers to the professor\". If we're in a situation where something was being evaluated for a grade, then when the prof doesn't know what you're saying to the student being evaluated, you could be assisting in cheating and it would be impossible to evaluate.\n\nBeing a band-aid for your classmates on this issue may feel like a nice thing to do, but this needs to be resolved on an upper level.

Personally, I don't think OP should get involved. It sounds like he is either another student or a junior instructor. Hijacking the teacher's lecture by loudly speaking across the room in a foreign language sounds counterproductive. Like it or not, if English is required, then English is required.

I don't feel like we are getting the full story here. YTA, it sounds like OP got involved in a situation he had no business in purely because he spoke the foreign language.

If you are taking a class and your language proficiency was so bad, you needed a translator app or another student to translate, then wtf were you going to do for finals? The fact that the teacher had no clue that they were using a language translator means that they never got set up with a learning plan so therefore the rules of the classroom are exactly the same.
