I am white, but I speak pretty fluent Korean. \n\nMy course at uni is a lot of international kids. Most of my friends on the course are Korean, save a couple, and after some awkward interactions and people saying things in front of me that they maybe shouldn't, it's pretty well known on the course that I can speak Korean among the Korean students. They'll come to me or message me if they're having trouble understanding instructions or assignments, and I'm always happy to help. It's good practice and I like being helpful anyways.\n\nOnto the story: this week we've been split up into different workshop days. I went in yesterday (my day) and it was going fine. It was me and maybe 12 other students and two lecturers.\n\nThe main lecturer, a woman we'll call Janet, got on my nerves though. At one point, she called out the girls next to me for being on their phones as she was speaking. They were Chinese and using a live translation app to understand her. When I pointed this out (they were struggling to explain) she just huffed and said \"it's still *very* disrespectful, as I feel like I am speaking slowly and simply enough for you to understand (she wasn't) but I guess I'll allow it.\" Oookay, weird, but whatever.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, we all stuck our work on the walls and Janet went around talking about some different people's work. She stopped on this one girl, Jihyun, and was analysing her work, use of materials, etc. She was speaking quickly, and using long, complicated language. I know Jihyun, she still really struggles to understand English if it's said too quickly. So when the lecturer turned to her and asked her to explain her process, I recognised that lost look in her eyes.\n\nShe was stood on the other side of the group to me, but I heard her say, in Korean, to her friend,\n\n*\"I have no idea what she said, do you?\"* Her friend shook her head, and my lecturer got annoyed and prompted her to start explaining really rudely. So I spoke up, in Korean, and quickly explained what Janet was asking. Like I said, she was across the room, so I kinda got everyones attention when I was speaking to her, but she seemed relieved and thanked me for explaining. As she was answering the question, she'd pause and ask me what a certain word or phrase's translation was. As usual, I was happy to help, and didn't think anything of it until after the workshop ended and Janet pulled me aside.\n\nJ: Just so you are aware, what you did earlier was *extremely* rude.\n\nMe, confused: What?\n\nJ: Talking over the class to that girl in another language, and then hijacking her chance to explain her work to the group. \n\nMe: She was struggling to understand you, so I helped. \n\nJ: I'm sure she could've figured it out on her own. Next time please keep to yourself and don't try to show off. \n\nShe then left, and I've been thinking about it ever since. I wasn't trying to show off, but maybe it came across that way? IDK.

May I translate for her?\"\n\nThis is what you should have said, rather than just starting to translate the professor's question. Otherwise, you were fine.

I\u2019m sure that instructor is a bigot in one way or another.", "NTA.\n\nAnd you should look into the process in your university for filing an official complaint against lecturers, and encourage the students who've been treated poorly (including yourself) to raise one about Janet's behaviour, which comes across to me as borderline xenophobic.", "INFO: what is the language of instruction for your university?\n\nIf students are signing up for a course delivered in English then they ought to be fluent enough to follow its proceedings.", "NTA. Janet is racist.", "Came here to say this. I was a uni tutor and worked with a lot of ESL ELL students. If this lecturer is being this much of a bully about students who aren't native English speakers not understanding her immediately then she ought to be reported to the dean by a group of these students. I would explicitly mention that she's being hostile about attempts to translate the material and refuses to simplify her explanations. Half of my job as a paid employee of the school was to re-explain assignment material to ESL students who were the victims of this same kind of linguistic shaming and I couldn't even help them as much as a bilingual student probably could have since I only spoke English and tutored in English so I just had to become really adept at finding phrasings that were easy for ESL students to understand-- which, by the way, is the appropriate response if you're an educator teaching in a single language and not \"I'm already being more than accommodating so shut up\" or whatever the gist of what your professor effectively said was. \n\nAt the very least, you should all leave her a very poor end of semester review if this keeps up.", "Absolutely alert the school! It feels like this lecturer is going out of her way to be difficult.", ">but if international students are struggling to understand this lecturer, then they should all file multiple complaints.\n\nAgreed, OP, go as high as you can and be LOUD, if this is in the US, this woman is most likely using MAGA feelings to bolster her bigotry.

Especially since the teacher was under the impression OP was giving answers.", "Also, if OP keeps translating it maintains the status quo.

You and the other students contributed to Janet\u2019s salary. She works for you and is not doing her job effectively. When you tried to help, she insulted you. If she was taking your lunch order, you likely would not stand for it. As your teacher, you should be even more unwilling to stand for it because the cost is higher. Look into the ways to complain. Is there a dean if international students? Even a department head will do.", "well, at the same time, international students are expected to still adhere to the language requirement of their schools. I did my masters in the Netherlands but they taught the program in English. If I chose Germany, I'd have to know German. Lectures are fit already in small time slots, and I am not sure how much adjustment the professor can make to their speed of talking without affecting the lessons and finishing on time every day.\n\nThat said, the professor is still an asshole, because you don't berate those that understand or those that are trying to help.", "I can imagine a teacher having some issues. At least where I went to university all students are expected to have a good enough level of English to engage with the content especially in tutorials. I don\u2019t think most would take issue so long as the students can engage with their group even if they need help with the teachers explanations (the phone would likely be brought up after several weeks in a tutorial although it wouldn\u2019t be in a lecture ) but if it\u2019s at the point where your having to ask for several (especially if they\u2019re non jargon) words in an explanation then it can comes across like they lack that basic level of English to engage with group discussion, which then affects other students negatively or given the tutor couldn\u2019t understand them it might\u2019ve seemed like OP was giving her the answers.", "Found the instructor.", "100% - it\u2019s a very short-term solution.", "> speaking quickly and using long, complicated language \n\nAs a second-language learner, that's a death sentence. If the majority of your group is ESL speakers, you want to be clear and concise and avoid phrasal verbs (give up, go out, etc.) and slang.\n\nBut if the teacher allows interpretation apps, having another student interpret shouldn't be an issue.", "Nope just being honest about the process for complains in university. Especially in the case of international students who don\u2019t receive the same sort of protections as other groups e.g disabled students. \n\nThe teacher might get a verbal slap on the wrist for saying she expected the students to be able to understand but that\u2019s honestly the furthest they\u2019d take a complaint like this without repeat offences."]}
