I am white, but I speak pretty fluent Korean. \n\nMy course at uni is a lot of international kids. Most of my friends on the course are Korean, save a couple, and after some awkward interactions and people saying things in front of me that they maybe shouldn't, it's pretty well known on the course that I can speak Korean among the Korean students. They'll come to me or message me if they're having trouble understanding instructions or assignments, and I'm always happy to help. It's good practice and I like being helpful anyways.\n\nOnto the story: this week we've been split up into different workshop days. I went in yesterday (my day) and it was going fine. It was me and maybe 12 other students and two lecturers.\n\nThe main lecturer, a woman we'll call Janet, got on my nerves though. At one point, she called out the girls next to me for being on their phones as she was speaking. They were Chinese and using a live translation app to understand her. When I pointed this out (they were struggling to explain) she just huffed and said \"it's still *very* disrespectful, as I feel like I am speaking slowly and simply enough for you to understand (she wasn't) but I guess I'll allow it.\" Oookay, weird, but whatever.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, we all stuck our work on the walls and Janet went around talking about some different people's work. She stopped on this one girl, Jihyun, and was analysing her work, use of materials, etc. She was speaking quickly, and using long, complicated language. I know Jihyun, she still really struggles to understand English if it's said too quickly. So when the lecturer turned to her and asked her to explain her process, I recognised that lost look in her eyes.\n\nShe was stood on the other side of the group to me, but I heard her say, in Korean, to her friend,\n\n*\"I have no idea what she said, do you?\"* Her friend shook her head, and my lecturer got annoyed and prompted her to start explaining really rudely. So I spoke up, in Korean, and quickly explained what Janet was asking. Like I said, she was across the room, so I kinda got everyones attention when I was speaking to her, but she seemed relieved and thanked me for explaining. As she was answering the question, she'd pause and ask me what a certain word or phrase's translation was. As usual, I was happy to help, and didn't think anything of it until after the workshop ended and Janet pulled me aside.\n\nJ: Just so you are aware, what you did earlier was *extremely* rude.\n\nMe, confused: What?\n\nJ: Talking over the class to that girl in another language, and then hijacking her chance to explain her work to the group. \n\nMe: She was struggling to understand you, so I helped. \n\nJ: I'm sure she could've figured it out on her own.

Half of my job as a paid employee of the school was to re-explain assignment material to ESL students who were the victims of this same kind of linguistic shaming and I couldn't even help them as much as a bilingual student probably could have since I only spoke English and tutored in English so I just had to become really adept at finding phrasings that were easy for ESL students to understand-- which, by the way, is the appropriate response if you're an educator teaching in a single language and not \"I'm already being more than accommodating so shut up\" or whatever the gist of what your professor effectively said was. \n\nAt the very least, you should all leave her a very poor end of semester review if this keeps up.", "Absolutely alert the school!

Especially when moving from \"translating the professor's question so that she can answer\" into \"helping her translate her answers to the professor\". If we're in a situation where something was being evaluated for a grade, then when the prof doesn't know what you're saying to the student being evaluated, you could be assisting in cheating and it would be impossible to evaluate.\n\nBeing a band-aid for your classmates on this issue may feel like a nice thing to do, but this needs to be resolved on an upper level.

If you want to be respected and your students to be engaged, be compassionate and engaging.\n\n> Also an issue with other student translation is that its far out of the realm of official accommodation\n\nThen the teacher should be telling the student to look for an official accommodation. She should be aware based on the student\u2019s responses that they are confused and require support. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t wrong to check in with the student, but to have a snit about another student helping translate is ridiculous.

Especially in prepared class materials and lectures since it sounds like the international students are a big part of the uni culture. \nVague phrasal verbs can usually be replaced with more specific verbs. \"I got it\" could be replaced with \"hold\" or \"understand.\" It could take practice, but the teacher making the effort can go far. Even if students still use them, teachers often repeat and rephrase statements for the class to ensure clarity.", "Native English. \nB2 Czech\nB2 Italian.\n\nSo yeah. I can comment on it thanks.", "What subject can you teach at university level where the class isn\u2019t at minimum going to contain a pretty consistent use of jargon", "That shouldn't be allowed, but I guess the university makes money on them.", "Yep, they have to do an English proficiency test, but apparently there are workarounds that get them past that.  Add to that the forged results some uni recruiters participate in, and it's bound to cause issues!", "And you learned them through courses in your home country? \n\nOr through family members or immersion in the country?", "Why so condescending? \nWhat languages do you speak?\n\nI went to Czechia, took the language course through the University so I could prepare myself to actually learn in the native language.\n\nItalian, on apps before living there, then better once living in the country. \n\nSatisfied?", "NTA. She doesn't know what rude means", "I am a teacher so, yeah, you could be YTA in some cases, not in others, its all case by case. In this particular case I would say NTA because your short comment didnt disrupt the class or anythig. \n\nTotally unrelated but once my Italian teacher (beginners course) got really pissed off at me for using some French in a sentence. She got offended or something. I guess people who dont speak other languages or people who have never left their country are unable to imagine someone not understanding what they are saying (like my grandma)", "NTA I suggest that you speak slowly and in a clear voice to your teacher from now for everything. In Korean. Seems like that is the secret trick to understand a foreign language. You gotta love teachers for teaching you such an awesome move", "Don\u2019t try to understand the mindset of a bad teacher, just protect yourself and continue to help your classmates!   Nta", "NTA but you should go to the school administrator or the department head or whatever is appropriate and have a conversation about how this teacher does not understand the concept of not speaking English fluently like a native and is making things harder for international students and then punishing you when you try to help.  Teaching can be stressful but she needs to learn how to effectively handle non-native speakers.", "This teacher is a culturally insensitive AH who got her ego bruised because she was pushing her students unnecessarily hard. How is that poor student going to explain her work if she doesn't understand what the teacher is saying in the first place? NTA.\n\nETA: Just saw [this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g6bmk/aita_for_translating_to_an_international_student/j523xxo?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) Yeah no, your lecturer is culturally insensitive as fuck, bordering on xenophobic.", "You're awesome. Janet is being weird or hypersensitive or something. If this class is that hard to understand, maybe you can get a teacher's aide position and get paid for being awesome, too.", "NTA \nThis prof should definitely have a formal complaint filed against her over this.", "NTA. I encourage you to go to faculty and explain the situation.  That lecturer is not providing ESL students with enough accommodation on their own and was inappropriate.", "NTA.  That proff has a rod, as well as a superiority complex, up her ass.  I think you should complain to her supervisors about her rude behavior which is frankly xenophobic", "NTA. You should ask your Korean friends to report this lecturer. If uni accepts international students and charge then higher fee, then they should accommodate them well. This is a serious issue and could destroy ppl\u2019s self-esteem.", "Go to the dean and department head, file a formal complaint. Not sure board of education would help or not but could do that too. The teacher is being discriminatory.", "NTA Janet has a lot of nerve calling you rude while acting the was she is.", "I think the lecturer's ego was severely bruised. YNTA.", "NTA. Janet sounds incredibly racist and has zero disregard for international studentsand. I would have all the struggling students file official complaint regarding the whole translation issue\n\nETA: My uni has live translation services for English students (a bunch of lectures are presented in Afrikaans). They have devices were you plug in earphones and listen to someone translating the whole dialog into a mic. Not sure where you're based and if this is in any way helpful, but yeah if they wanted to there are ways", "NTA and well done for having the emotional empathy to recognise when someone needs help. My suggesion would be to report the lecturer, people are paying to get an education, she must teach!", "Agreed. I went to an international university and students who weren't sufficiently proficient in the language weren't supposed to be taking classes. I TA'd some courses and students frequently tried to Google translate entire essays and use translators during exams, which obviously didn't fly as there was a single language of instruction (English). OP is YTA but only because they're getting involved. The students shouldn't have been in the courses in the first place.", "You need a lot to learn. One of the biggest boosts to language learning is immersion. I've taught English as a second language and also learnt a second language to the level where I'd definitely struggle in university (initially)", "I am an educator who has also learned a second language at university to fluency and now teach it. I studied linguistics and language acquisition. I also teach EAL. \n\nImmersion is vital but comprehensible input is essential. If you cannot understand anything being said there is no benefit - if you let your students struggle the way this professor intended to, deliberately speaking very fast as OP stated and using overly complex language, then you're doing your students a disservice.\n\nThe OP even states she had trouble following what the lecturer was saying herself. That is not going to help anyone learn.", "Agreed. But translating is not solving that problem, something has to change.", "My vote for the thing to change is the idiotic and xenophobic professor.", "For sure. I'm German but had the last 4 years of high school in English and talking to German friends about math or is so painful sometimes.", "So, when you moved to the country, would you have been able to follow a university course and someone \"speaking at a breakneck pace and using really niche technical terms and sometimes even made up ones, incredibly fast, sometimes trailing off mid sentence and just starting a new one, difficult for even a native speaker to follow.\" ?\n\nSorry about the condescension, I think I had too many conversations with some of my MILs Brexit voting xenophobic neighbours recently...\n\nI speak German, Dutch, English fluently, as well as French and Spanish.", "No, because I did the right thing and made sure I was proficient. IE. taking the language course at the University and arriving 6 months early so I could learn enough to take my course at a minimum. \n\nCry more lol. \n\nYou still didn\u2019t answer my question. What languages do you speak?"]}
