I am white, but I speak pretty fluent Korean. \n\nMy course at uni is a lot of international kids. Most of my friends on the course are Korean, save a couple, and after some awkward interactions and people saying things in front of me that they maybe shouldn't, it's pretty well known on the course that I can speak Korean among the Korean students. They'll come to me or message me if they're having trouble understanding instructions or assignments, and I'm always happy to help. It's good practice and I like being helpful anyways.\n\nOnto the story: this week we've been split up into different workshop days. I went in yesterday (my day) and it was going fine. It was me and maybe 12 other students and two lecturers.\n\nThe main lecturer, a woman we'll call Janet, got on my nerves though. At one point, she called out the girls next to me for being on their phones as she was speaking. They were Chinese and using a live translation app to understand her. When I pointed this out (they were struggling to explain) she just huffed and said \"it's still *very* disrespectful, as I feel like I am speaking slowly and simply enough for you to understand (she wasn't) but I guess I'll allow it.\" Oookay, weird, but whatever.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, we all stuck our work on the walls and Janet went around talking about some different people's work. She stopped on this one girl, Jihyun, and was analysing her work, use of materials, etc. She was speaking quickly, and using long, complicated language. I know Jihyun, she still really struggles to understand English if it's said too quickly. So when the lecturer turned to her and asked her to explain her process, I recognised that lost look in her eyes.\n\nShe was stood on the other side of the group to me, but I heard her say, in Korean, to her friend,\n\n*\"I have no idea what she said, do you?\"* Her friend shook her head, and my lecturer got annoyed and prompted her to start explaining really rudely. So I spoke up, in Korean, and quickly explained what Janet was asking. Like I said, she was across the room, so I kinda got everyones attention when I was speaking to her, but she seemed relieved and thanked me for explaining. As she was answering the question, she'd pause and ask me what a certain word or phrase's translation was. As usual, I was happy to help, and didn't think anything of it until after the workshop ended and Janet pulled me aside.\n\nJ: Just so you are aware, what you did earlier was *extremely* rude.\n\nMe, confused: What?\n\nJ: Talking over the class to that girl in another language, and then hijacking her chance to explain her work to the group. \n\nMe: She was struggling to understand you, so I helped. \n\nJ: I'm sure she could've figured it out on her own. Next time please keep to yourself and don't try to show off. \n\nShe then left, and I've been thinking about it ever since. I wasn't trying to show off, but maybe it came across that way? IDK.

Calling out students for using translators in college is an absolute no no, especially after being told it\u2019s a translator.", "NTA.

If Jihyun had a problem with your translating that would be one thing. But Janet is on a power trip. This is all about her ego which is a terrible quality for an educator.

As a cultural thing they may not want to complain about the teacher, but that doesn't mean you have to stop helping if they want your help.", "NTA - Janet sounds extremely culturally insensitive. She should be thanking you.", "NTA. Janet is though and it sounds like she didn't like you embarrassing her so she's taking that out on you. It isn't like you just assumed that your classmate needed help and tromped all over everyone, she was clearly struggling and you helped her. The teacher, if she actually cares about teaching, should care more about actual effective communication than her arbitrary idea of respect.", "NTA, and in fact I think it's worth submitting a complaint about this instructor for cultural insensitivity.", "NTA. Janet is setting these students up to fail, whether she is conscious of it or not. She needs to be reported to someone.", "NTA, infact, more people should strive to be like you in that regard. If you can help someone, do so. If that person asks you not to, you stop. Simple as that. But Janet? FRIKIN JANET!?

Keep acting like you are we need more ppl like you. Also you could try talking to a headmaster or counselor if you trust them and yk theyll do something.

They can't be bothered to learn any other language, and not understanding what someone is saying in another language frightens them because they assume the others are talking crap about them.  In an environment like this, there should actually be language assistance offered as part of the learning standards... or they should simply require that all students be tested for fluency in whatever core language is being used.  That's clearly not the case here.  Her ***job*** is to teach people something.  The fact that she would rather they not understand her than have you speak a language she doesn't understand, indicates she's a very poor instructor and not a very caring human being.
