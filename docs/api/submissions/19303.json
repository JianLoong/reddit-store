She doesn't care if YOUR child goes hungry as long as she isn't inconvenienced herself. She had many other options other than taking your daughters food. She was too lazy selfrighteous and holierthanthou to do the right thing. She owes you the formula and an apology.", "NTA what she did was straight up theft, also, she's known you for 23 years, she's just using group trauma as an excuse for why you're the one in the wrong.

She's entitled.", "NTA.\n\nEven if it had been a fair trade, she should have asked (or at least told) you. You don't take shit without a word.

She simply could\u2019ve asked you beforehand and avoided the whole situation completely.

Often people have to ration items out to the very last day, to make sure they make it to the next payday.

I'm not seeing what problem OP created for himself in this.", "Cheap childcare is not an excuse to steal from someone else even if you \"deduct it\" from the bill.

I've also lived without a paycheck on handouts. I know how it goes, but I never said the OP was the AH for being upset that his sister took the formula. Only that their reaction did nothing to help their situation. If anything, it made it worse.

I'll still stand by NTA because she did steal from you, and she could've at least talked to you before taking it, but I'll give you a soft YTA for how you responded.

Budgeting / planning and having 1.5 tubs of formula on-hand IS being a prepared parent. \n\nHis sister STOLE from him and refused to make it right.

Just make sure you're not being taken advantage of, for your daughter's sake.", "if he didnt shout, she still would have not returned the formula. his choices are either a- his kid has to go hungry or b- he has to bounce a payment for something else to buy formula. do you really think he would be ok letting a thief continue to watch his kid who obviously doesnt care if she has food or not? he is not to blame for the ending of the sitter situation at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut yes, lets blame the victim whos **baby formula was stolen.**", "Uhhh, no it's not fact. You don't get to decide how you will take payment for services when you have an existing agreement lol. If you had an employer who owed you $1500, do you think you could show up and take a car in their possession valued at that much? What a joke.", "Unless he agreed to that prior to her taking the formula she stole it.  You can't take something from someone without them knowing and then just be like \"Oh just take it off what you owe me\" That is theft...", "Taking it without permission is stealing regardless of so called intent. if I take your car to joyride the neighborhood and tell you hey it's not stolen I'll bring it back later...still theft. If you work for a restaurant and take a case of steaks home and tell the boss yah i was just gonna deduct it from my wages...still theft. Going to your bros house and walking out with your nieces food ...THEFT. \nOp was the responsible prepared one...despite his finances he had food for his child. It's thieving sister who was too irresponsible, lazy and \"busy\" so decided that entitled her to STEAL from OPs home", "What are you even talking about? She took the formula without asking, that is stealing 100%.", ">f he didnt shout, she still would have not returned the formula\n\nThere's no way for us to know that. Be reasonable.\n\n>his choices are either a- his kid has to go hungry or b- he has to bounce a payment for something else to buy formula\n\n That's a huge jump to actually think that his kid would go hungry from this. They are 100s of resources he could turn to if he was afraid of that happening. Was it right what she did? No, and I never said it was. Nor am I defending her actions. You can\u2014and should\u2014re-read my comments if that's still unclear to you. My stance has been OP isn't TA this entire time. \n\nBefore this, they seemed to be on fairly good terms. They could have worked this out like the adults they are. Not everything requires an emotional response like you hive-minders seem to think. \n\nI think you're getting a bit too emotional to talk about this and I have no interest running in circles. So I'll end it here. I hope your day gets better.", "I was never debating whether or not OP was TA, I agree with you there and that is clear. Where I disagree (and you can and should re-read my replies to see that is also clear) was that his reaction was \"the cause of ending the sitter situation\" in which you blame OP for. but obviously we'll have to agree to disagree since you cannot comprehend my replies and instead call me a \"hive-minder\" and blame the victim. I hope a family member never steals your baby's last can of formula and refuses to give it back. have a lovely day\\~"]}
