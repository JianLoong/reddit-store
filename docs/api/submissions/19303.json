I get your position on not wanting to ask them for help but any grandparents would be pissed if grandkid isn\u2019t getting enough food.", "NTA.\n\nShe stole food out of your baby\u2019s mouth. Very literally. Even if you owed her money, that\u2019s not an okay thing to swipe. Ever. \n\nI am assuming you yelled at her\u2014loud voice, maybe some curse words. If she\u2019s traumatized by that, I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s made it through life.\n\nIf you crossed a line, however\u2014threatened her (even hyperbolically) that is not cool. \n\n\u201cGive me my fucking formula\u201d \u2014fine\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming over and breaking down your door to get my shit\u201d \u2014Not okay \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to beat your ass if that formula isn\u2019t back in ten minutes\u201d \u2014 Not okay!!", "I'd loop the BIL in on the situation and see where he sits. Probably he's gotten a totally different story from his wife, but that doesn't mean he won't see reason if spoken to calmly.", "I'm so confused by his sister's actions. If she ran out of formula, couldn't she just order it online and have it delivered if she didn't have the time to go to the store? Or she's totally out, doesn't have time, she could still take a little bit to tide her over until the delivery happens? I can think of so many ways to deal with this other than taking literal food out of my niece's mouth when I know that my brother is on a tight budget.\n\nAnd also, as a sexual assault and dv survivor, I'm appalled at how she's using gender abuse trauma. This is her brother, and unless they have a history of him being aggressive towards her/women, this accusation is ridiculous.", "*from his baby", "I'd post it on the local community group on Facebook.\n\n*Has anyone got any baby formula they could spare me? My sister had stolen the formula for my baby and I cannot afford to replace it. I'd be really greatful if someone here could help me. (include screenshot of sisters text)*\n\nPeople are always willing to help, and you should never underestimate the power of public shaming.", "Why does it matter?\n\nEven if she made the choice to use her own formula for her niece, it does not justify taking formula without discussing it with OP first. At most, she should have asked for it some more money tact on to her payment or for him to give her a canister when he gets paid.\n\nThe fact that she took it without permission is stealing. And she is refusing to return it. She is fully in the wrong.", "In a comment OP says that he pays her monthly.\n\nHe does not have any money right now to buy more formula or to pay her, because he does not have money until the 19th. The sister has money, and just does not want to go to the store or does not have time to go to the store. She has options, she has no need to steal formula from a baby.\n\nEither the sister gives the formula back, or someone helps him hopefully, or the baby has no formula until the 19th unless her father is able to put off paying some other bill that he needs to pay.", "I was going to ring him, but he has me blocked on all platforms, so I'm almost certain that he's been told some twisted version of events", "I could also see taking the formula and cashapp-ing the cost to her brother. But just taking it, knowing that your brother's finances are tight? That's evil.", "Second this. People will likely help.", "Don't forget to tag her in it. Her husband for good measure too.", "then NTA", "I'd be going to their house and getting my formula back.  There are a multitude of options before you get to, \" I'll just take the whole container.\" But no you're sister went right to the easiest and most selfish option.  I despise thieves.", "I've already commented this further down below but you should seriously post this situation in your local Facebook community group.\n\n*Has anyone got any baby formula they could spare me? My sister has stolen the formula for my baby and I cannot afford to replace it. I'd be really greatful if someone here could help me. (include screenshot of sisters text)*\n\nPeople are always willing to help, and you should never underestimate the power of public shaming.", "Right? I just don't understand this woman's mindset at all!", "She stole from his baby daughter and took her food. Now he does not have enough money or formula. His reaction is completely reasonable.\n\nI had an overproduction of breast milk when I had my son, so I happily gave some of my milk to a neighbor. But, if that neighbor had cleaned out my freezer without telling me and took all of the milk I had stored, I would have been furious. I would have yelled at her and I would have cut her off completely. (Obviously they would have enough of my milk to last until they found another donor.)", "I'd give her one more chance to return it, then call the police. Seriously. Formula is fucking expensive, and theft is theft.", "Great idea! And tag the sister or no? Im torn on that. Thought I'd ask you since it was your idea", "No need to, if his parents are on Facebook they'll either get the notification of his post, or some of their friends (and hers) will see it and react to them.\n\nPublic shaming works on everyone involved. His sister absolutely for stealing from a baby in the first place, and his parents for both raising an entitled shit *and* for not immediately stepping in and buying some replacement formula for their grand daughter whilst OP worked to resolve this.\n\nShe's already trying to back him into a corner over his yelling, tagging her into the post will be aggressive (even if passive) and might add weight to her argument in the eyes of others.", "I'm going to jump here and say be bloody careful if you decide to approach this.\n\nOP is British. A lot of deadbeats get away with only paying \u00a37 per week in child support because they don't work. OP could risk having the \u00a365 a month cut right down to \u00a328\n\nOP needs to approach their local GP about accessing some healthy living vouchers.\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/healthy-start"]}
