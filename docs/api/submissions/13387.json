Some relatives lives near his Home, have a son, Kris (23 M), who was recently dumped. My MIL(close to Kris as he is her errand boy) mentioned Kris plans to study abroad and hopes for generous donations from [me.As](https://me.As) it was very unexpected, I didn't probe further at the time.\n\nWhen we got married my Father gave us a joint account with 3 million in it as a nest egg. We haven't used it for anything as he was abroad and I was still staying in my Home. \n\nIn the next 2-3 days , I understood my MIL wants me to take that money for Kris.He will need around 2 million(and he is expecting at least half of that from me) for the course fee, travel, accommodation etc. I decided to talk to him about what his plan was.\n\nHe was very relaxed about the whole thing and said my MIL told him she will take care of the money &he was not really excited to do higher studies, he just wanted to show his ex that he is having a good time even though she dumped him. Even if any part of me was planning to give him a single penny, after seeing his attitude about the whole thing, I decided against it.I wasn't going to spend 2/3rd of my Father's life savings for an immature boy to show off before his ex.\n\nI made it clear to my MIL I won't give money. She got upset and told I should check with my Father as its his money, but obviously he also refused. He suggested if it means that much to my MIL, we can split the cost in thirds with MIL and SIL. SIL got mad, saying Kris is irresponsible and can't pay back as his family is not well off either. She was awfully silent when it was about giving only my Money.\n\nWe adviced Kris to try to get a student loan and he was like...No, that's too much work.Banks are very complicated. So at the end, he ended up not going.\n\nIt's been 2 years since this incident and after this I have been noticing this typical MIL complaints she is nagging my husband with.That I didn't reply to her daughter's texts, or I didn't take an interest in nephew's poem recital or some very childish things like that. And she now thinks I should stay with them and do all their household chores as I am the Daughter In law , it's my duty to look after them.\n\nThe sad thing is even though my husband don't let all these naggings make their way back to me, when we occasionally discuss the same,he always take his family's side and says I am not attached to them, that's why I don't understand their perspective. As I am a single child, they think I lack compassion and that's why I didn't give the Money.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing the money?", "created_utc": 1679995742, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124j5aa/aita_for_refusing_to_give_money_to_husbands/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They may be extended family through marriage but this does not make them your responsibility. You are not their bank or their maid. You are your own individual person who has been gifted a generous inheritance from your father.

That money was a gift from your father to get started on your new life with your husband. Honestly, it doesn't even sound like you HAVE started your new life yet which is also troubling.  \n\nYour MIL feeling entitled to YOUR money is another HUGE red flag. I don't know what your next step is, but personally, I myself, would just get away from ALL of them because they sound selfish and toxic and it appears as though you are married to MIL as well since she won't stop with her insults and your husband won't set boundaries with her. It looks like your husband is ALWAYS going to be under his mother's thumb, and that will doom your marriage, because it is not healthy for a man to allow his mom to insult his wife all the time. \n\nTake that money and run, get far away from these people because they are toxic and are making YOU MISERABLE. If you are UNHAPPY, you haven't even moved in together yet, WHAT are you GETTING from this marriage besides grief, frustration and heartache? \n\nYour husband REFUSES to be your PARTNER in life, instead, he has CLEARLY delegated that role to HIS MOTHER.

You should be concerned that your husband apparently is sympathetic to their point of you. Your mother-in-law had no business whatsoever telling somebody that you would spend money on a kids education, that is categorically none of her business, and she shouldn\u2019t of said anything. And you should move in with her and do her house work? Marriage is at work well when people are partners, when people have each other\u2019s backs, and when they stand up for each other.  I understand your husband wants you to look at things from their perspective, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be pushing them hard to look at things from your perspective. And regardless of how things find your Way back to you what\u2019s being said is not acceptable.

Why on earth would he need 2 mill to study abroad?", "NTA its your money to do with as you please. The biggest thing that you need to look at is how you MIL and SIL were both on board with the plan until they needed to pay money.
