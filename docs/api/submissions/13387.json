I\u2019m sure you will be fair once you decide not to let them leave you looking silly by withdrawing money then telling you \u201c they had every right\u201d.  Fix your crown queen.", "No, just move it. If you tell him they will take it!", "Create a new account AT A DIFFERENT BANK and then transfer the money into it.", "Do not talk to him first.", "Pls, don't tell him, he clearly doesn't have your back when it comes to his family.", "NTA Your own father gives his only daughter a huge sum of money and you put it into a joint account instead of your own - huge mistake. Your MIL then tries to bully you into handing over your father's money and you think somehow that is normal? You were going to actual consider handing over your money? She has power of attorney over her son, and it's a joint account? I cannot believe this. The man you are married to backs his own family over you, the family want to strip you of your money and use you as a maid of all work and you are not hearing alarm bells?", "NTA \n\nMove the money ASAP and tell your husband that as his mother has access, it is staying away from her.", "Is your mil out of her f-ing mind? That is the most ridiculous, outrageous, entitled bs ever. Your father gifted you that money to help provide some security to you and your husband. Eventually you will purchase a home, have children, I\u2019m sure that is more what your father had in mind for you. That you have this money is not mil\u2019s business. If she wants to pay for her nephew\u2019s education, she can do as she pleases, with her own funds. You are in NO WAY obligated to pitch in, split, donate, or help with her causes. FFS. And just an fyi, I have a wonderful relationship with my parents and in-laws and if any of them asked for money or anything else, I would give/do it in a heartbeat. \n\nBut your in-laws.. run if your husband does not see an issue with their behavior. Definitely move the money back into an account of your father\u2019s. Your husband won\u2019t blink an eye to withdraw at his family\u2019s finger snapping and you\u2019ll be left with nothing to buy a home when the time comes. Will mil be taking up a donation for you when that happens?", "Definitely NTA but what school costs 2million? That's crazy", "NTA move the money, do not discuss it with your husband.  You can let him know afterwards.  Your mil is behaving this way because the man of your family (father) has passed and she believes you now have no one to stand up for you.  Would your father agree to give most of your money away to a stranger, money your dad worked and saved for to leave as an inheritence to his daughter.  Would your dad want you to be a maid for your in laws.  As a parent I definitely would be livid if my kid was treated in this manner by the in laws.  Your husband is enabling his mom to mistreat you emotionally and financially, he is no winner.  Second would he even support his mom's side if your dad was alive, probably not.  You are being disrespected and abused by him and his family.  Speak up and do not have a child until all this is resolved.  This is not a family you want to be involved with for the next 50 years, they will only break you down.  Respect yourself. His family will steamroll over you and your future kids and you will have no support from your husband when they do.  Leave him, he is not a nice person nor a good husband as he is allowing his family to mistreat you.", "36th thousand is 3 million rupees. Nta but it\u2019s also not a ton of money. Do you work?", "NTA. The money your father gave you was not your MILs to give. She overstepped majorly! If all they value you for is money or chores, and your husband doesn\u2019t back you, I\u2019d seriously reconsider this relationship.", "NTA", "NTA\u2026it is your money and they want most of it for a kid who just wanted to impress an Ex?  No matter the reason, I cannot believe the gall to ask someone else for one million, met alone two?!  Honestly, I will be amazed if this relationship survives, especially long distance.  Where did his family find out anyway about your money?   You are not TA, but everyone pressuring you is and that includes your husband.", "NTA. Please go to the bank TODAY to move those funds to your own account or your father's. I think the latter is a better option, and maybe your father can give you (in your own account) a set, smaller amount from the 3 million each year. \n\nAlso, why do your in laws know that this money exists, or even the amount???", "NTA take the money from the account and get a divorce lawyer. This idea of his family coming first isn\u2019t going to change it will only get worse. Get out before you trap yourself with a kid.", "NTA - It is not that you are not interested or attached to them. It is that you are not their own personal bank. Their only interest in you is to demand withdrawals of money. Once they know they will never get any money from you, now they are reduced to small attacks? Your husband needs to open his eyes to their actions. Ask him who he married - you or his mommy.", "While I agree that you should protect the nest egg that your father generously gifted you and your husband, it has been two years. Noether your husband or your MIL have touched that account, apparently.\n\nI would ask or tell your husband that you should Power of Attorney, not his mother, over any and all decisions, health and financial.  It he doesn't agree to that, then maybe take the money and give it back to your father", "Hiding marital assets could be criminal, so maybe make sure that's not a possible prison term before doing that.", "You need to secure those funds IMMEDIATELY and let your husband know that once his mother no longer has POA you'll immediately add his name to the new account.    \nINFO:  Why are you in a long distance marriage and how much longer will this continue?", "You can make accounts multi sign. This requires both parties to be present to access the money. When this is done typically the account will become read only on your online banking and at atms. Any transactions on the account would then require both parties to physically go to the branch to approve the transaction. Banks also sometimes have the ability to freeze accounts in marital disputes (i know this isn\u2019t that but they may be able to freeze the account until he returns to have it switched so no one can use it)", "What??  WHY does his mommy have power of attorney and his WIFE doesn't????\n\n\nThat's a big enough red flag in my book to pull everything of mine out of any joint accounts.  I certainly hope he isn't on the title of your house because she can try to force a sale.", "It would be very difficult to somebody who doesn\u2019t make an effort to see both sides of the situation. And you don\u2019t need to see both sides of the situation to tell your mother that your wife isn\u2019t her live in maid. I understand culturally that in some countries daughters-in-law do that, but you certainly don\u2019t owe your mother-in-law anything like that. And something tells me if you ever want crazy enough to do that she would treat you even worse.", "May I ask something?\n\nWhy are you not with him?\n\nYou know my landsmen worked outside my birthcountry too and most of the men built a second family there.\n\nYou husband being nice could be that you feel guilty and be their \"desired\" daughter in law aka maid\n\nAs I said before where I come from most women spent their life separated from their husband alone with the inlaws", "Don't talk. Say you feel better that only you two should be responsible because it came from you father", "If you do that the money will be gone.\n\nHe will tell mammy.\nHonestly, seriously don't.\nJust don't \nIf that acciubt only has that money in it. Move it now or stop transactions on it.", "Is the money still in the account ? Do you know for sure?", ">tbh my husband and even in laws were very supportive at that time.\n\nRight, of course they were supportive, because your backing was gone and it's time to turn you into your mother in laws house servant.\n\nNTA see a lawyer and a banker, move that money.", "When did you last check if that money is still there ?", "No! No! Do not talk to husband first because he will tell mil and she will do what you are scared will happen. Get the money safe then talk. Oh love. Get this sorted asap", "Don't talk to him!!!", "Is this Dollars?", "NTA. Protect that money, OP. It was given to you by your parents; your in-laws have no right to stake any claim on it.", "NTA\n\nIf he's irresponsible and wouldn't be able to pay anyone back, why should throw away the money your father gave you on your husband's lazy family member with no desire to work for anything but spite?\n\nYou don't owe his family money, or the servitude they're hinting at now.\n\nGet your money out and run.", "Clearly you come from a different culture from me, but I'm totally NTA. Nobody deserves your money but you and you get to decide how you spend it. If he doesn't tell you things, how do you find out? Is he shutting them down on this or just simply not telling you what they are saying? Because he should be shutting them down.", "Transfer the money back to your father and file for divorce.

HE DON'T NEED 2 MILL TO STUDY ABROAD.\n\nHonestly NTA, take the money, and yourself, and RUN. They don't want a DIL, they see you as a free maid/nanny", "NTA.\n\nGet that money the fuck out of that joint account immediately.  \nMoney can make even the kindest people suddenly act horribly.

I don\u2019t understand where int he works that makes sense??", "oh for fuck's sake. You HAVE to move it. Right away. This minute. That's unacceptable.", "Power of attorney allows her to do only what husband wants not benefit herself or those she chooses though. She has a fiduciary duty.", "Time to have a serious conversation with him about what you want and what he wants and expects and how his family is going to fit into this.

Especially if its a third of what your father gave you.", "No just move the money. Tell him that you\u2019re uncomfortable with her being able to access it.

If so, start transferring a couple thousand every other week or month. If you don't say anything about it, I doubt that it's an account she's checking every day.
