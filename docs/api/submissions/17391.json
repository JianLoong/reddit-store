We have two daughters (10 & 3). We both come from divorced families, and all of our parents have since re-married - though my mom\u2019s 2nd husband passed away a couple years ago. My wife\u2019s parents are no longer local, but my mom and dad both live in the same metro area as us.  \n\nI have a very good relationship with my dad & step-mom and they are our sole support for helping out with the girls.  My mom and I have an up-and-down relationship as a result of a lot of things over a lot of years. Nothing excessive\u2026annoying step-dad, drug addict brother, grandparenthood not meeting her expectations.  My mom also doesn\u2019t come by contentedness easily. After years of running around to try and accommodate everyone, lately I don\u2019t always put in the effort I should with her because often the effort isn\u2019t appreciated anyway.\n\nSo for Mothers Day this year I wanted to give my wife the day.  But I didn\u2019t want to pressure her with coming up with a rigid plan.  I asked her Friday if she wanted brunch or dinner made and to let me know what she wanted to do with her day when she knew.  I mentioned I would take the girls to see all their grandparents in the middle of day so she could have the house to herself if she wanted the peace, or we could do something as a family.   Again, no pressure, just let me know as we go and I\u2019ll make it happen. She tells me Saturday brunch sounds good, so Sunday morning the girls and I run to the store for supplies, make brunch, set out the gifts.  We eat and play for a bit and the wife mentions I could take the girls.  \n\nI call up step-mom and wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day and ask if she\u2019s around.  She is, so the girls and I stop by for a visit.  \n\nThen I call my mom, and I can tell by how she answers the phone she\u2019s annoyed.  I wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day and ask if she is available for a visit. She is at her sister\u2019s for brunch and won\u2019t be home until later when the 10 year old has activities.\n\nFast forward to Monday and I get a text from my wife that my mom had sent a screenshot of my wife\u2019s post on social sharing about her day, and told her she had a terrible day and didn\u2019t feel the love from anyone.  \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for prioritizing my wife having a full day over doing something for my own mom?", "created_utc": 1684247892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j721l/aita_for_prioritizing_my_wife_over_my_own_mom_on/", "score": 1818, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You certainly didn't intend to cause any harm and still had the intention to visit. So I don't really feel like you did anything wrong. I would personally try and call her hear her out while also explain to her how things were up in the air initially so you didn't have a solid plan but always had her in mind.

Mom didn't need to send texts to your wife, as if it's her fault that Mom didn't get a visit on Mother's Day.  She's disappointed with YOU, she should be talking to YOU, not your wife.  If she's blaming your wife, you need to snip that sherty nonsense right now. You yourself in the post say you don't make enough effort with her, and you note she's a somewhat recent widow.  Maybe Mom is just lonely, trying to get your attention again, and doesn't know the right way to get it.  Set Mom right, take the blame yourself, and fix it.

Difficult to grasp for some, I guess.", "NTA, and super shitty of your mom to try and cannonball your wife's good day.", "NTA i\u2019m part of the \u201cmothers day is about my Mom camp\u201d but we are low key celebrators, we don\u2019t make a fuss about things - tell mom \u201chappy mother\u2019s day\u201d (in person or by phone), and then visit & gift (but visit/gift is optional; gifts are usually flowers but can be flowers + something else). That\u2019s it. \n\nI would actually consider your activities - brunch & gifts - more as assisting your kids celebrate mother\u2019s day as your wife is the mother of your children (though if you say happy mothers day to your wife & got her a gift as well, I would find that strange, that\u2019s not what we do, but you do you). Assisting the kids is usually prioritized first in my family when they\u2019re young, morning is spent at home for that, then it turns over to each parent contacting their Moms (if alive/if relationship in good standing) and then going out to visit them or not (not usually a long visit, just for tea). Like, the responsibilities as a parent and putting your kids first comes before your parents.\n\nI would have phoned Mom before stepmom, but you did cite a good vs difficult relationship. I\u2019m also part of the camp that if a Mom is a bad Mom, then she doesn\u2019t deserve to be acknowledged/celebrated on mother\u2019s day (same with Dad for father\u2019s day) (being a mother/father is more than just giving birth/creating a kid; you don\u2019t get to be celebrated if you were awful/abusive to your kids and giving birth/them being born was the high point of the relationship -not saying that that is what\u2019s going on here, but just to be clear on my stance).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mother\u2019s Day is coming and mom hears nothing from her son. She\u2019s been lonely the last few years between a pandemic and the loss of her husband. He is no longer there to fill her days or make sure she has a nice Mother\u2019s Day. She wonders if her sons will get in touch, but who knows between the one\u2019s addiction issues and the tenuous relationship she has with the other. But she is hopeful. \n\nAs the day gets closer, she hears nothing. She agrees to go to brunch with her sister; it\u2019s better than being all alone watching social media flood with mother appreciation posts. At the last minute, son calls for an immediate visit with no notice. She can\u2019t attend, and that\u2019s it for her Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nIt\u2019s rude for her to rope your wife in; disappointment should be directed at you. It\u2019s inappropriate, but far from uncommon. Instead of being annoyed at her, think about what it would feel like to sit alone on Father\u2019s Day, no partner, no cards from your kids, wondering if anyone cared. Accepting an invite from your brother so you didn\u2019t spend the day totally alone. \n\nYou sent no card, flowers, treats, or other minor tiding. You didn\u2019t even give her a heads up on your plans so she could be available. Either of which would take less than five minutes. Unless you are actually estranged, this makes YTA.", "ESH. Planning ahead is a thing. Phones exist and can be used, rather than waiting for the actual day to try. You\u2019re 38. If you actually wanted to see your mom, it would have happened.

It would have been better to either block off some time with her that weekend ahead of time or just sent a card and/or flowers and made a plan to celebrate after to allow your wife to have a relaxed day with no plans, which was a great idea.\n\nBut don\u2019t get me wrong, your mom\u2019s reaction was way out of line. I want to reiterate that it\u2019s entirely appropriate and should have been expected for you to prioritize your wife, the mother of your children, on Mother\u2019s Day. Also, the reason your mom couldn\u2019t see you is because she was at another Mother\u2019s Day celebration. \n\nI know lots of folks are going to be quick to say that nothing you do would have been enough for your mom due to her outsize reaction.

Also, his wife is an actual mom so the day is literally hers.", "very insightful", "Things are never going to get better with her. She\u2019s decided who she wants to be, and this is it. So, it\u2019s time to focus on your life and your priorities, and not be ashamed about it. Even if she doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s *good* that you\u2019ve stopped lighting yourself on fire trying to keep your mom warm. Let her be a drama queen and demonize you, because she\u2019s going to do that no matter what. Even if some people buy her bullshit, her whining is a reflection of *her,* not you.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would continue pulling away from that relationship as much as possible. You\u2019ve got a life and a family to take care of, and you don\u2019t need her nonsense. Go celebrate the people who appreciate you. Your mom can stay mad.", "Sounds like she needs to learn the lesson:\n\n\u201cPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes\u201d.\n\nThis Mother\u2019s Day was her first reality check into understanding that. If you want to see progress and growth, I say sit down and give her boundaries, specific examples of behavior that\u2019s effecting your choices, and a very fair (yet serious) list of things she can do to improve things. If she can\u2019t or wont take it seriously, she needs to also recognize that you have every right to not prioritize her needs above your families until she does. It\u2019s her choice. Stick to your guns otherwise nothing will ever change/adapt/improve.\n\nPaint her a clear picture of what things could and would be like if she DOES take it seriously. Stay firm and don\u2019t accommodate her whims if she won\u2019t compromise.", "It\u2019s also not surprising that the relationship is rocky with bad communication skills. He also texted the stepmom ahead of time in the morning. Not really surprising the mother would be upset not having heard from the kid either leading up to or in the morning on Mother\u2019s Day.", "I agree. She could have gone to her son and told him that she felt forgotten, but instead his mother went after the wife knowing that she had nothing to do with the plans and she did it on full public display. Sounds like she was after attention one way or another.", "It is rich that she complained to his wife and not to him. Maybe she needs to think about how she treats people before she expects to be treated nicely.", "No it's about celebrating your own mother because your wife is not your mother. /s\n\nThat's what gets me about all those posts saying that people don't celebrate their spouse on these days because they are not their parent. No they are not but they are a mother or father that you are married to. Why wouldn't they be celebrated on a day that honors their position in life?", "I don\u2019t see it that way at all. My kids should do stuff for their mom. My wife\u2019s day is Valentine\u2019s and our anniversary.", "This assumes that Stepmom is lesser than mom. Not knowing their relationship, Stepmom might be more important, or at least equal, to OP.\n\nEdit: Sorry, I read this incorrectly as a \"didn't he visit stepmom first?\" type of statement, so nvm, please ignore.", "he wanted to visit both? but the mom was busy. he legit called her up to ask for a visit lmao", "I feel like you're damned if you do, damned if you don't with people like this though. Like not calling ahead meant she wasn't free. But letting her know in advance would have set an expectation that he goes to see her, even if it ended up not fitting into the plans for the day. If his wife didn't want them to leave, he would have gotten guilt tripped for getting his mom's hopes up. \n\nHe prioritized what his wife wanted to do, and she didn't know what she wanted in advance. So while it would have been nice to see his mom if that's how it worked out, it was more of a \"if my wife wants us out of the house this is what we will do\" rather than \"I plan on taking the kids to see my mom\".", "Or at least notifying her that he doesn't know the schedule for Sunday but will do his best to come by.", "Yeah, if he hoped she already made plans and WANTED her to be too busy, this is exactly how he would have done it. I don't understand all the praise. It's the worst \"planning\" anyone has ever planned. Because there was zero plan.", ">  I think that his mom would be a lot less upset if he\u2019d communicated his plans to her earlier and tried to arrange a time to visit\n\nHe didn't know the plans.  He left everything open so that his wife could decide what she wanted in the moment.  He tried to get together on short notice, it didn't work.  Shit happens.", "It could BE checking a task off a list.\n\nOP's mom comes across as unlikeable.", "Yeah, as soon as I saw that part, I figured \"you can't make this person happy.\"", "Yes not saying older mothers shouldn\u2019t be celebrated. They just shouldn\u2019t be prioritized over the wife who is currently mothering young children. Older mothers should be included so long as they aren\u2019t toxic.", "I am not surprised she\u2019s upset. But the question isn\u2019t solely am I the asshole because my mom\u2019s upset with me.", "I respect the question but worry Reddit isn\u2019t paying you enough to open that can of worms.", "Cause she wasn\u2019t available when they could visit. They said Happy mothers day though.", "> Also, his wife is an actual mom so the day is literally hers.\n\nThis is exactly the point.  He focused exactly where he should, on his wife.  \n\nThe point about the wife not making plans with her mother is that by your standard, she is also TA because she didn't make plans with her mother in advance.", "I put in the effort that is deserved", "Did you read the second paragraph? Where he states he used to run around to make sure everyone was equally accommodated but his mother would still complain and not appreciate his efforts? OP has three mother's to attend to throughout the course of a day with his kids in tow. He prioritized his day accordingly.", "She was trying to make the wife feel bad for the actions of her son. \n\nShe felt hurt, so she hurt the wife, on purpose.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t have a nice day, the wife shouldn\u2019t either.\n\nPure jealousy.", "Exactly! It\u2019s wild to me that a human gets 18+ years of celebration and still is salty when their kids have a family of their own who they then need to celebrate.", "It\u2019s actually infuriating the amount of fully grown adults in here the past few days claiming that not celebrating your wife and MOTHER of your children on Mother\u2019s Day is totally fine because she\u2019s not *your* mom, or putting the responsibility of finding a gift to give on small children and literal infants. Sorry, that\u2019s not how that works, as the other parent you\u2019re responsible for making sure your spouse feels appreciated on mothers/fathers day ESPECIALLY when they have made sure to make you feel appreciated on your day in the past", "So if you have 2 small children with said wife you don\u2019t help them to make your wife\u2019s day great? You just say to heck with wife I need to shower my mom who has gotten these days for my entire life? Feel bad for your wife if that\u2019s the case.\n\nETA - not to mention you should WANT to celebrate the woman who made you a parent as well.", "And are you teaching your kids how to do that? Depending on their ages and how much practice they have at gift giving and planning things for other people, they may not be able to come up with a plan on their own. Literally your job to teach them by doing the work of honoring your partner in this way.", " Do you at least help your children get something together or just leave them to wreck the kitchen and serve her burnt toast?  That's the big issue here is men are leaving their kids to do mother's day with no assistance to make it decent experience. The baby/toddler years are the hardest and men act like because the baby can't serve breakfast in bed mom shouldn't be appreciated. \n\n My husband admitted to me they never did shit for his mom growing up because no one helped or encouraged them to do so. It was a huge contention between us because he never showed me appreciation and the fact I had random strangers wishing me happy mother's day when the man who helped make me a mother wouldn't even acknowledge it was sad. It's fine if you don't want to do anything personally but at least recognize the holidays existence, wish your wife well and help your kids make it memorable. It'll teach them to do the same with their kids.", "It doesn\u2019t assume anything of the sort. It\u2019s just reading what he wrote about who he called and when.", "personally, if I\u2019m in this situation where I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to see my mom on Mother\u2019s Day, then I\u2019ll just send a card and flowers to the house.\n\nthat way, my mom feels some sense of \u201cmy child thought about me and loves me\u201d", "He did have a plan though. It may have been a go with the flow type of plan, but he could have told his mom that he was letting his wife have the day and that they *might* be able to see her.  If someone told me that, I would have just said I wasn\u2019t available at such and such time, if you can make it, cool. If you can\u2019t, that\u2019s fine too. He set an expectation the previous years and he changed it, the least he could have done was notified people how the day may turn out.", "He's not celebrating her as a wife though, he's celebrating her as the *mother* of his children so I kinda fail to see your point. He did his part with his own mother with congratulating her and offering her a visit.", "Yeah, no. Mothers who are still actively *mothering* take priority over someone who hasn't parented anyone in 20 years.", "Young children arent going to know how to celebrate their mother without heavy guidance. Mothers day or Fathers day wont be celebrated at all if the spouse doesnt take initiative to do something. \n\nGrandparents no longer have the stress that comes with actively parenting all day every day so it makes no sense for them to be the center of either holiday.", "I don't think you treated your stepmother kindly, either, BTW. Your \"plans\" for Mothers Day made both ladies total afterthoughts.", "Would any random normal mother be upset about your treatment of her on Mothers Day = yes. If that's what you're asking--yes, YTA.", "Based on that response, the response from Mom is probably not unexpected, and I continue to go with NTA.", "Why didn't he tell her about his plans earlier instead of calling her and asking to come visit right at the last minute?", "No it wouldn\u2019t make her TA because she\u2019s a mom, OP is not. He can find a way to honor his wife AND his mother since the day is meant for them both. Once his wife became a mom then it becomes her right to do what she pleases on the day since it\u2019s co-dedicated to her.", "Lol ok? Thanks for the absolutely pointless conversation", "Sending a text doesn\u2019t go against prioritizing his wife. His mother, who likely feels lonely with the passing of her husband, felt like an afterthought because she was.", "but it\u2019s not an either/or situation!!\n\nthis isn\u2019t an issue at all if he sends her a card, sends flowers to the house, calls his mom on Friday to say \u201chey here\u2019s our plan for the day, what are yours?\u201d, if he does something to show her that he thought about her on Mother\u2019s Day.", "This. When my kids are grown then I will not care as much if I don't get the mothers day attention from my spouse. But at this point, being a mom has been so hard and at times thankless so it's nice to have just one day to feel like maybe my husband thinks I'm doing an ok job at this parenting thing", "Sure I\u2019ll help, but it\u2019s still not about husband/wife. There are other holidays for that. This is about honoring YOUR mother, not your wife.", "Yeah, you're right, totally read it wrong.", "Yeah I think everyone is failing to see my point bc they\u2019re not reading to understand it lol. I\u2019ve stated that OP is NTA in any capacity multiple times. \n\nI responded to a specific sentiment that was expressed in the original comment stating that it was \u201centitlement for older mothers to expect to be celebrated as a priority\u201d and I simply was expressing my opinion that it isn\u2019t entitled for a mother to expect their child to celebrate them \ud83d\ude05 the holiday is intended for children, younger and older, to celebrate the woman who gave them life/raised them. I never once said it was wrong that he celebrated his wife as well, bc he celebrated in someway each woman that was important to him\u2026 That\u2019s literally it lmao", "According to who though? Some believe Mother\u2019s Day is strictly for your mother only and some believe it\u2019s for all mothers of all stages\u2026 It isn\u2019t an objective fact that Mother\u2019s Day is for \u201cactive duty\u201d mothers most of all, like some people who just made that term up are saying lol without the OG mom, none of that would even be possible", "\u201cYoung children aren\u2019t going to know how to celebrate their mother without heavy guidance\u201d \n\nPlease see where I stated that the father could\u2019ve played a HUGE role in HELPING his kids celebrate their mother and HE could\u2019ve celebrated HIS OWN mother in full capacity lol. There\u2019s a reason why there are projects and assignments in schools that are designed to help kids make things for their mothers for this specific reason. And that statement isn\u2019t even true, kids are eager to please and show appreciation for parents that are deserving. They make arts and crafts and put on shows on their own accord without any help quite often lol.", "Cause he prioritized the mother of his kids.", "See I disagree.  Once his wife became a mother, his mother no longer  gets to expect that he will make her the priority on mother's day.  Active Duty moms get priority over veteran moms.", "Sorry, I was unaware there was a certain timeline to contact someone on a special day. You're very focused on, BUT SHE'S HIS MOTHER, and conveniently ignoring all of the surrounding context regarding their relationship.\n\nI guess I should probably start working on my laundry list of apologies, all of those happy birthday, Merry Christmas, and congratulations texts I've sent after 11AM. A tragedy in itself. I sent a happy Mother's day text at 3pm on Sunday, I suppose I shall be whipped in the streets for my crimes.", "As stated above he didn\u2019t know the plans until his wife told him on Sunday. He wanted to give her whatever day/ plans she wanted FIRST. Once she gave the green light for him to take the girls for visits he got on the phone. His mom wasn\u2019t available. He still wished her a Happy Mothers Day\u2026 she can be upset but she did NOT need to send the other MOTHER screenshots to let her know that she got a better day than her. She made it an either/ or by doing so.", "It\u2019s actually about honoring and celebrating ALL of the mothers in your life.", "When moms act like OP\u2019s, it\u2019s often because they feel bitter that they were \u201creplaced\u201d by a daughter-in-law. It\u2019s not the fact that they feel entitled to being celebrated, it\u2019s that they see it as a competition, and they want to be the mom who \u201cwins.\u201d\n\nSource: My own mother-in-law who called my husband crying when I wanted to spend my first Mother\u2019s Day with my new little family doing what I wanted instead of spending 4 hours in the car driving to her house and back. And who has made rude comments about how he must not care about her when he didn\u2019t buy her a gift because we helped our kids make her Mothers Day presents instead.", "Sounds like OP has a strained relationship with the OG mom the way it is. Not all of us had mothers worth celebrating. And the ones who put up the biggest stink over not getting enough recognition are often the ones least deserving.\n\nMother's Day is for anyone who wants to celebrate the most important moms in their lives and each of us gets to decide who that is for ourselves.", "Its hard to fully celebrate 2-3 people in one day. Someone is going to feel like they were let down in some way. A visit with your son and grandchildren should be enough. She wasnt free to do so, which is understandable she has her own life, but being upset because the mother who is actively parenting had priority is ridiculous and childish.", "Saying he prioritized his wife implies that telling his grandmothers about his plans would've taken away from the wife in some way. But that's not the case. No sacrifice would've been made to his plans by filling them in and ensuring they would be available for a visit.\n\nOP is just passive aggressive. Considering how the mother responded, by posting to social media instead of talking to him about her feelings, he probably learned this behavior from her.", "I don\u2019t think his post implies she expected to be the priority but just that he would consider her in some way too. I am not in agreement with Reddit that men should focus solely on their wives and stop honoring their moms once they have kids. I think there\u2019s room to love and celebrate all the important people in our lives in appropriate ways. \n\nHis mother shouldn\u2019t have reached out to the wife about this though, that was not cool.", "The issue is it doesn't have to be one or the other. This whole thing could have been avoided with a little planning. OP is the AH for not putting a modicum of effort into scheduling. \n\nOP didn't even give his mom forward warning \"hey, here's the plan for the day are you free later\" he just ignored her until later in the day. How hard would it have been to send a text or call to line something up?", "Seems he knew Saturday that his wife wanted brunch. Didn\u2019t know until Sunday whether he\u2019d be visiting others. \nPersonally, I don\u2019t have a problem being a mom right now and letting people know my thoughts the day before. Or the week before. I think it would have been simple and considerate to plan a day or a couple days in advance whether there would be grandparent visits. It\u2019s just common courtesy. And if the visit isn\u2019t happening that weekend, it could always happen the next weekend. Not everyone likes to fly by the seat of their pants though.", "I agree. I wasn\u2019t speaking about OP mother specifically. The comment I responded to is what I was speaking on.\n\nI personally stopped celebrating mothers day bc I don\u2019t have a desire to do nice things for a not so nice mother but I was just saying in general it\u2019s not entirely entitled for an OG mom to wanna be celebrated and appreciated by their son, in a similar capacity rather than less. I think everyone can choose who they wanna celebrate but I was just kind of playing devils advocate bc it would truly hurt my feelings if I spent my life raising a child and then the child just knocked me down to the bottom of the list of importance the moment he gets a wife. I feel that there\u2019s room for everyone to be considered and appreciated. That\u2019s all.", "I agree.", "So I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t read any of my comments in full because I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re explaining that to me lol I will repeat, for the 4th time, that OP is NTA and that he did everything right in this situation. I was speaking on something specific that was stated in the parent comment\u2026 We\u2019re trying to have a discussion, while speaking on two completely different topics \ud83d\ude02 I do not disagree with you lmao", "I don't know, I read it like she expected to get everything that OP's wife got.  \n\nI didn't say stop honoring their moms altogether.  I simply don't think that moms of adult children with children should expect the same focus as they got before their adult children had children.\n\nThere is room to celebrate others, but what that celebration entails depends on a lot of different cultural and familial norms.", "There\u2019s also the part where effort on his part was never good enough for his mother anyway so why should he put in a lot of effort? Seems like his mother is reaping what she has sown", "I\u2019m sure he could have communicated with it his wife better to plan out visits but it also seems like he didn\u2019t really care to see his mom and he REALLY wanted his wife to have a day that wasn\u2019t planned or forced and simply was her day however that looked.", "I didn\u2019t read it that way but we\u2019re still in agreement that mom behaved poorly towards his wife.\n\nI also did not say you said we should stop honoring our moms. I said that\u2019s a Reddit attitude (which has been dominant this year) and that men should honor their moms/wives in appropriate ways. (Prioritizing the mother of their children while also honoring their own mothers.)\n\nA lot of these posts have come up due to Mother\u2019s Day and I believe many people tend to project boundaries issues within their own families on all mothers. Not every mom of adult children is a drama queen expecting constant attention and praise yet when a \u201cveteran\u201d mom gets upset about not being included in her child\u2019s day the comments all seem to rush to her not respecting the new wife. (This last paragraph is more a general thought based on multiple posts, not specifically this one.)"]}
