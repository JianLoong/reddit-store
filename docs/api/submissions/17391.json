We have two daughters (10 & 3). We both come from divorced families, and all of our parents have since re-married - though my mom\u2019s 2nd husband passed away a couple years ago. My wife\u2019s parents are no longer local, but my mom and dad both live in the same metro area as us.  \n\nI have a very good relationship with my dad & step-mom and they are our sole support for helping out with the girls.  My mom and I have an up-and-down relationship as a result of a lot of things over a lot of years. Nothing excessive\u2026annoying step-dad, drug addict brother, grandparenthood not meeting her expectations.  My mom also doesn\u2019t come by contentedness easily. After years of running around to try and accommodate everyone, lately I don\u2019t always put in the effort I should with her because often the effort isn\u2019t appreciated anyway.\n\nSo for Mothers Day this year I wanted to give my wife the day.  But I didn\u2019t want to pressure her with coming up with a rigid plan.  I asked her Friday if she wanted brunch or dinner made and to let me know what she wanted to do with her day when she knew.  I mentioned I would take the girls to see all their grandparents in the middle of day so she could have the house to herself if she wanted the peace, or we could do something as a family.   Again, no pressure, just let me know as we go and I\u2019ll make it happen. She tells me Saturday brunch sounds good, so Sunday morning the girls and I run to the store for supplies, make brunch, set out the gifts.  We eat and play for a bit and the wife mentions I could take the girls.  \n\nI call up step-mom and wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day and ask if she\u2019s around.  She is, so the girls and I stop by for a visit.  \n\nThen I call my mom, and I can tell by how she answers the phone she\u2019s annoyed.  I wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day and ask if she is available for a visit. She is at her sister\u2019s for brunch and won\u2019t be home until later when the 10 year old has activities.\n\nFast forward to Monday and I get a text from my wife that my mom had sent a screenshot of my wife\u2019s post on social sharing about her day, and told her she had a terrible day and didn\u2019t feel the love from anyone.  \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for prioritizing my wife having a full day over doing something for my own mom?", "created_utc": 1684247892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j721l/aita_for_prioritizing_my_wife_over_my_own_mom_on/", "score": 343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps you could have called her earlier and that's what she was more after or that she felt out of the loop and that you may have never had the plan to even call or come to visit perhaps her horrible time isn't even related to you and your later attempt to visit was like the last straw. You certainly didn't intend to cause any harm and still had the intention to visit. So I don't really feel like you did anything wrong. I would personally try and call her hear her out while also explain to her how things were up in the air initially so you didn't have a solid plan but always had her in mind. So the both of your can feel heard and understood. I'm sure her reaction has to be more than just this one isolated incident.", "NTA there is so much to unpack in this but I noticed that your mother contacted your wife to tell her she was upset rather than contacting you directly, and she spent time with her sister so she was celebrated.\n\nEdited because I misread the post.", "NTA You wished your mother a happy mother's day.

Even if your wife is usually in charge of that stuff, she shouldn't have to do that on Mother's Day, especially if it's to visit *your* family.", "NTA. You did not make too much of an effort.

Most people make Mother\u2019s Day plans in advance so I could see why this would hurt your mom. However, she  was wrong to get your wife involved in it.", "INFO Did you do anything for your mom on mother's day besides the call? Like sending flowers, etc.", "ESH.  You asked if she could hang out, she said no.  There's nothing inherently wrong about that.  \n\nHowever, if I'm reading this right.... you didn't give her much notice.  You called her Sunday, the day of. Mom was busy.  What, was she supposed to sit on her hands, staring at her phone, waiting for you to call?  I mean, I would have appreciated a heads up.  You couldn't have called or texted Mom that Saturday? \"Hey, wife might want some time to relax Sunday afternoon. Do you have plans then?  Can we come by? What time works for you? I'll let you know what's going on!\"   \n\n  \nHowever, Mom does sound difficult, and you sound like you've been trying to make her happy for a long time.  Mom didn't need to send texts to your wife, as if it's her fault that Mom didn't get a visit on Mother's Day.  She's disappointed with YOU, she should be talking to YOU, not your wife.  If she's blaming your wife, you need to snip that sherty nonsense right now. You yourself in the post say you don't make enough effort with her, and you note she's a somewhat recent widow.  Maybe Mom is just lonely, trying to get your attention again, and doesn't know the right way to get it.  Set Mom right, take the blame yourself, and fix it.   Either establish a relationship with Mom that works for you both (counseling?), tell her to back off, or go LC, but whatever you do, get that \"it's wife's fault\" narrative out of her head.", "NTA.

Flabbergasted even. Non biased NTA.", "NTA. The mother who gave you your children gets priority on Mother\u2019s Day. Then the other moms in your life. Difficult to grasp for some, I guess.", "NTA, and super shitty of your mom to try and cannonball your wife's good day.", "NTA i\u2019m part of the \u201cmothers day is about my Mom camp\u201d but we are low key celebrators, we don\u2019t make a fuss about things - tell mom \u201chappy mother\u2019s day\u201d (in person or by phone), and then visit & gift (but visit/gift is optional; gifts are usually flowers but can be flowers + something else). That\u2019s it. \n\nI would actually consider your activities - brunch & gifts - more as assisting your kids celebrate mother\u2019s day as your wife is the mother of your children (though if you say happy mothers day to your wife & got her a gift as well, I would find that strange, that\u2019s not what we do, but you do you). Assisting the kids is usually prioritized first in my family when they\u2019re young, morning is spent at home for that, then it turns over to each parent contacting their Moms (if alive/if relationship in good standing) and then going out to visit them or not (not usually a long visit, just for tea). Like, the responsibilities as a parent and putting your kids first comes before your parents.\n\nI would have phoned Mom before stepmom, but you did cite a good vs difficult relationship. I\u2019m also part of the camp that if a Mom is a bad Mom, then she doesn\u2019t deserve to be acknowledged/celebrated on mother\u2019s day (same with Dad for father\u2019s day) (being a mother/father is more than just giving birth/creating a kid; you don\u2019t get to be celebrated if you were awful/abusive to your kids and giving birth/them being born was the high point of the relationship -not saying that that is what\u2019s going on here, but just to be clear on my stance).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
