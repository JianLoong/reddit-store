We have two daughters (10 & 3). We both come from divorced families, and all of our parents have since re-married - though my mom\u2019s 2nd husband passed away a couple years ago. My wife\u2019s parents are no longer local, but my mom and dad both live in the same metro area as us.  \n\nI have a very good relationship with my dad & step-mom and they are our sole support for helping out with the girls.  My mom and I have an up-and-down relationship as a result of a lot of things over a lot of years. Nothing excessive\u2026annoying step-dad, drug addict brother, grandparenthood not meeting her expectations.  My mom also doesn\u2019t come by contentedness easily. After years of running around to try and accommodate everyone, lately I don\u2019t always put in the effort I should with her because often the effort isn\u2019t appreciated anyway.\n\nSo for Mothers Day this year I wanted to give my wife the day.  But I didn\u2019t want to pressure her with coming up with a rigid plan.  I asked her Friday if she wanted brunch or dinner made and to let me know what she wanted to do with her day when she knew.  I mentioned I would take the girls to see all their grandparents in the middle of day so she could have the house to herself if she wanted the peace, or we could do something as a family.   Again, no pressure, just let me know as we go and I\u2019ll make it happen. She tells me Saturday brunch sounds good, so Sunday morning the girls and I run to the store for supplies, make brunch, set out the gifts.  We eat and play for a bit and the wife mentions I could take the girls.  \n\nI call up step-mom and wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day and ask if she\u2019s around.  She is, so the girls and I stop by for a visit.  \n\nThen I call my mom, and I can tell by how she answers the phone she\u2019s annoyed.  I wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day and ask if she is available for a visit. She is at her sister\u2019s for brunch and won\u2019t be home until later when the 10 year old has activities.\n\nFast forward to Monday and I get a text from my wife that my mom had sent a screenshot of my wife\u2019s post on social sharing about her day, and told her she had a terrible day and didn\u2019t feel the love from anyone.  \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for prioritizing my wife having a full day over doing something for my own mom?", "created_utc": 1684247892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j721l/aita_for_prioritizing_my_wife_over_my_own_mom_on/", "score": 4427, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You certainly didn't intend to cause any harm and still had the intention to visit. So I don't really feel like you did anything wrong. I would personally try and call her hear her out while also explain to her how things were up in the air initially so you didn't have a solid plan but always had her in mind.

Mom didn't need to send texts to your wife, as if it's her fault that Mom didn't get a visit on Mother's Day.  She's disappointed with YOU, she should be talking to YOU, not your wife.  If she's blaming your wife, you need to snip that sherty nonsense right now. You yourself in the post say you don't make enough effort with her, and you note she's a somewhat recent widow.  Maybe Mom is just lonely, trying to get your attention again, and doesn't know the right way to get it.  Set Mom right, take the blame yourself, and fix it.

Difficult to grasp for some, I guess.", "NTA, and super shitty of your mom to try and cannonball your wife's good day.", "NTA i\u2019m part of the \u201cmothers day is about my Mom camp\u201d but we are low key celebrators, we don\u2019t make a fuss about things - tell mom \u201chappy mother\u2019s day\u201d (in person or by phone), and then visit & gift (but visit/gift is optional; gifts are usually flowers but can be flowers + something else). That\u2019s it. \n\nI would actually consider your activities - brunch & gifts - more as assisting your kids celebrate mother\u2019s day as your wife is the mother of your children (though if you say happy mothers day to your wife & got her a gift as well, I would find that strange, that\u2019s not what we do, but you do you). Assisting the kids is usually prioritized first in my family when they\u2019re young, morning is spent at home for that, then it turns over to each parent contacting their Moms (if alive/if relationship in good standing) and then going out to visit them or not (not usually a long visit, just for tea). Like, the responsibilities as a parent and putting your kids first comes before your parents.\n\nI would have phoned Mom before stepmom, but you did cite a good vs difficult relationship. I\u2019m also part of the camp that if a Mom is a bad Mom, then she doesn\u2019t deserve to be acknowledged/celebrated on mother\u2019s day (same with Dad for father\u2019s day) (being a mother/father is more than just giving birth/creating a kid; you don\u2019t get to be celebrated if you were awful/abusive to your kids and giving birth/them being born was the high point of the relationship -not saying that that is what\u2019s going on here, but just to be clear on my stance).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mother\u2019s Day is coming and mom hears nothing from her son. She\u2019s been lonely the last few years between a pandemic and the loss of her husband. He is no longer there to fill her days or make sure she has a nice Mother\u2019s Day. She wonders if her sons will get in touch, but who knows between the one\u2019s addiction issues and the tenuous relationship she has with the other. But she is hopeful. \n\nAs the day gets closer, she hears nothing. She agrees to go to brunch with her sister; it\u2019s better than being all alone watching social media flood with mother appreciation posts. At the last minute, son calls for an immediate visit with no notice. She can\u2019t attend, and that\u2019s it for her Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nIt\u2019s rude for her to rope your wife in; disappointment should be directed at you. It\u2019s inappropriate, but far from uncommon. Instead of being annoyed at her, think about what it would feel like to sit alone on Father\u2019s Day, no partner, no cards from your kids, wondering if anyone cared. Accepting an invite from your brother so you didn\u2019t spend the day totally alone. \n\nYou sent no card, flowers, treats, or other minor tiding. You didn\u2019t even give her a heads up on your plans so she could be available. Either of which would take less than five minutes. Unless you are actually estranged, this makes YTA.", "ESH. Planning ahead is a thing. Phones exist and can be used, rather than waiting for the actual day to try. You\u2019re 38. If you actually wanted to see your mom, it would have happened.

It would have been better to either block off some time with her that weekend ahead of time or just sent a card and/or flowers and made a plan to celebrate after to allow your wife to have a relaxed day with no plans, which was a great idea.\n\nBut don\u2019t get me wrong, your mom\u2019s reaction was way out of line. I want to reiterate that it\u2019s entirely appropriate and should have been expected for you to prioritize your wife, the mother of your children, on Mother\u2019s Day. Also, the reason your mom couldn\u2019t see you is because she was at another Mother\u2019s Day celebration. \n\nI know lots of folks are going to be quick to say that nothing you do would have been enough for your mom due to her outsize reaction.

Your Mom shouldn't have reacted publicly or toward your wife the way she did. Everything else about how you handled this has me side-eyeing you though. Waiting until not just the day of, but right when you wanted to come over (especially since you didn't have flexibility to wait a bit) to call is inconsiderate. Assuming she'd be sitting around with no plans waiting for someone to show up on a day she can reasonably expect to be thought of, when you didn't touch base with her at all, is inconsiderate. That reads to me \"I don't really care if I see you but I'm going to throw you a bone so you can't claim I didn't\". I think feeling hurt and ignored is a very fair reaction to that. I understand that you didn't have solid plans, but prioritizing your wife doesn't have to mean everyone else is an afterthought. Checking in ahead of time to explain that you were basing your plans around your wife's schedule, but saying that you'd like to bring the kids over at some point and asking what times they would probably be free would have much more considerate. It's pretty rude to expect people to be home, free, and ready for visitors on your whim. It also seems pretty unnecessary since visiting them seems to have been a part of your plan the whole time. Even calling the morning of to check in would have been better than calling right before you wanted to come over.", "Both TA. You could have called your mom easily in the morning to wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day and let her know what the plan was so she could let you know when she was free.

He prioritized his wife, as he should, but prioritizing one person doesn\u2019t mean you have to forsake all others. He expected everybody else to be waiting around for him. I tend to believe that if it were important enough to him to celebrate his mom. He would\u2019ve found a way to make a plan for it instead of treat her as an afterthought. Now I can\u2019t speak to the relationship or whether not she deserve to be celebrated. I\u2019ll leave that too, him and others to decide, but if she deserves to be celebrated, that she deserves some level of planning. Your question was, are you the asshole for prioritizing your wife for that i say NTA but are you an asshole for marginalizing your mom?

I don't mean afterthought in the sense that they don't think about her at all, but in the sense that she is going to be a lower priority than the other mother (OP's wife). Some comments I've seen around here on other posts actually encapsulates the idea really well. It can vary by culture of course, but regarding mother's day, all maternal figures should be celebrated. BUT the biggest points are supposed to go to those still in the trenches so to speak. If you have kids that are single or just simply coupled, then yes as long as there's a good relationship they should hopefully do something nice if that's the norm. But if your child has children, they have a different mother that is being celebrated. A different person that is still currently doing the hard work that deserves the accolades. So while I can understand her feeling like an afterthought, the mom needs to figure out she's had her days and right now mother's day is mainly about the mother to OP's children.", "If your children are grown and have you made you into a grandparent, then you absolutely do not come first on Mother\u2019s Day.

The bar is pretty low I guess bc he's apparently perfect for giving his wife a couple hours of free time and handling brunch.", "Sounds healthy that her son didnt make any plans with her, so she scheduled lunch with a sister and stayed busy.  Do we know DIL and mom's relationship? Do they regularly text and confide in each other?  Has she been caring in the past with her and she feels like she might be a friend or someone that'd understand? We dont know. Not enough info to know a \"sit down\" with mom is needed imo. You've made mom the villain in your head but we don't know if he has often dropped the ball etc so In just looking at what a normal mom would expect and minor communication isn't a lot to ask for."]}
