Since its a overnight trip they are going on that same night, I brung it up to them and before I could even finish talking they were both yelling no at me. They said that there is no way that I\u2019m allowed to do that and its selfish of me to ask them to let me do that when they are away, now they aren\u2019t going away that far but it also happens to be my dads birthday that day and he said it was out of order for me to be asking to do that on his birthday and that i\u2019m selfish for asking to. Now I kind of get their point but I\u2019m going to be a adult soon and going off to university to live alone, there will be no alcohol involved as it is a under 18\u2019s night and I have a lift from a good friend there and back, I just feel like I\u2019m being controlled. I really do want to go and I want to make them come around to the idea but they are so stubborn I know they wouldn\u2019t even let me explain my reasons why and they would just scream at me.
