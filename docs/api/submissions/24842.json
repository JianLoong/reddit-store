He had a daughter from a previous marriage, Ellie (F29). We were never close because when they moved in with us Ellie was super super clingy, would always follow me around and basically stalk me in my own home. Your typical know-it-all, barely left the house, so basically had zero friends that werent online. \n\nSo Ellie managed graduate early and get into a really good college on scholarships, then got a masters there as well. Shes in engineering and her college is like apparently one of the best ones for engineering. So straight after graduating she was earning a crazy amount. \n\nShes been rubbing this in my face ever since she got the acceptance letter, when she was home she was always wearing the university hoodie, always talking about what shes doing at college, sending videos of robots and shit into the family groupchat. Now that shes earning so much its shit like her paying off our parents car loans for christmas or getting extravagant gifts for everyone. We had a few fights about it but we always made up.\n\nSo now onto this year, I got engaged last year in february to my fiance (M32). I asked my sister if she would pitch in and she said she would help out. Knowing she had the money I got to plan my dream wedding, I was so excited about planning our big day. That was all until I showed her the plans and she pulled the rug from beneath my feet. She asks me how Im paying for it (my husband and I didnt do college so are not high earners) and I reminded her that she said she would help. Shes now saying that she wont help pay for it and she will at the absolute most pay for my dress. I told her its unfair of her to lie to me and only tell me after planning everything that she isnt actually going to help. \n\nShe blew up at me over us not being close in the past and blaming me for it. It takes two people to bond. But she claims everythings my fault. We argued for a bit and now shes not even paying for my dress. All the wedding planning Ive done has been for nothing now. My parents are split, with my mom saying Ellie needs to honour her word and let me have the wedding I planned and we all pitch in what we can afford. My step-dad is angry I asked her in the first place and dug up some old arguments from when I was 17.\n\nAita for expecting her to do what she said?", "created_utc": 1692234071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15t82cy/aita_for_expecting_my_very_rich_sister_to_pitch/", "score": 5362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since she is earning way more than me I assumed she would contribute more. So I planned my dream wedding but then after everything was planned she told me she would only pay for my dress. I argued that this was unfair and since she has the money she should be helping me.\n\nI might be the asshole because we havent been super super close.

She offered to buy your dress (that\u2019s helping) and for that alone you should have been grateful.", "YTA. Someone saying they\u2019ll help with a wedding in no way indicates they\u2019ll just pay for the whole thing. Just because she has money doesn\u2019t mean you are entitled to it. And when dealing with wedding budgets you should always find out what people are actually willing to spend and not count on the money until it is in your hand. You and your mother are delusional thinking Ellie ever agreed to, or should have to, pay for your wedding.", "YTA. You admit you are not close, why should she pay?", "[deleted]", "YTA.  Pay for your own wedding. Tacky asking her for money.\nShe said she would help out,not pay for your dream wedding.\n\nYou sound jealous of her hard work and sucess", "Info needed: how much brainwashing did it take to convince your fianc\u00e9 with the whole stepsister that I\u2019ve always hated pays for my dream wedding plan?", "YTA You can't pay for a champagne wedding with a beer pocket book. If you don't want your sister to buy your dress, it's your decision. She said she'd help with wedding not pay for a lavish ceremony and reception.  Plan the wedding you can afford.", "YTA.  You spend all this time being petty and resentful about her success and generosity, then ask for cash the second it's good for you personally.  You didn't bother to ask what amount she was willing to give towards it before making plans so when you have clearly made an assumption and done lavish plans on her dime, it's the kind way to put you in check to ask how you'd pay for it.  Buying the dress when she didn't need to is a big offer.\n\nShe's \"rich\" because she busted her tail in school and EARNED making more income.  You decided to do something else then chose to marry someone in a equally low income.  You aren't her child and need to live in your own means or at best ask your parents", "Info: was she \\_specific\\_ about what she'd pay for?  If I offer to take my friend out for dinner he's kind of an AH if he picks a $75/plate place.  She might have figured she'd be helping with stuff like hall rental and dress costs, and you decided to soak her.", "Yes, YTA.  So, Ellie is your younger stepsister you basically had no use for and then seemed to be jealous of who somehow you thought would foot your dream wedding.  Apparently she did say she'd help and offering to buy your dress IS helping.  That's generous help, I'd say, all things considered.  I don't see where she signed on to pay for whatever you chose to set up.  \n\nYou're not entitled to Ellie's wealth.  She earned it and it is 100% hers.  It's nice that she has chosen to share some of it with family at times.  \n\nEllie owes you nothing.  Your thinking is absurd.  Have the wedding YOU can afford and be happy with it.", "How was she rubbing anything in your face by simply being exited about her achievements and sharing them with her family? And why would she pay for the whole thing? I mean, you said she said she\u2019d help\u2026 you assumed she\u2019d pay for everything and then got upset when she wouldn\u2019t and has absolutely no responsibility to do so, she\u2019s your stepsister, not your parent. Also, you haven\u2019t said one good thing about the poor girl in your me me me post, not even when your introduced her and fam\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine what growing up with you must have been like\u2026 \n\nOh, YTA", "YTA.\n\nShe was 11 when you were 17. While it's okay to not be close to her, the fact that you're describing her as \"clingy\" rather than just noting that the two of you were different ages is wild. Of course she would follow you around, that's what 11 year olds do with older teens!\n\nYour examples of her rubbing her success in your face are similarly out of touch. College students often wear their university hoodies, talk about what they are doing in college, etc. That's her living her life. It's not a dig at you simply because you didn't get to or chose to have that experience. Plus you're hurt that she's helping out your shared parents and/or buying expensive gifts?! That's similarly absurd. It's really clear at this point that you are taking your own insecurities out on her. Nothing she is doing is incorrect and, if anything, you should be grateful that some of the financial burden of taking care of your parents won't fall on you. I'm not entirely clear what you fought about in terms of her helping others out or being generous, but that's very clearly a you problem.\n\nNow you had the hypocrisy to ask her to help with your wedding. Weren't you just the one complaining that she rubs her wealth in your face by paying for things? You can't have it both ways. The fact that you called her \"stalkerish,\" admit you were never close when she wanted to be and you didn't, and still have the nerve to even ask her to help out is absurdly entitled. You were already the asshole for that.\n\nShe was kind enough to say she would help. Then you went full delusional and somehow translated that into her paying for the wedding without any discussion. Not the mention, the tackiness of trying to plan a wedding you can't afford when you're 35 and expecting others to pay. Of all the things to ask for, you asked for a wedding as though it was a need?! How immature are you? You complain you\u2019re in your 30s and making minimum wage, yet when you ask a relative for help it\u2019s not for anything that betters your life (help going back to school, help with a better job, help purchasing a home, etc.) but instead to throw a party?!\n\nThen after you act like a spoiled little brat she still is generous enough to offer to pay for the dress (one of the more expensive parts of a wedding) and you act like that's nothing. That's a huge help that you were idiotic enough to reject.\n\nThis, is the most absurd part of all: \"She blew up at me over us not being close in the past and blaming me for it. It takes two people to bond.\"\n\nYour first paragraph was literally you describing her wanting to be close to you and you rejecting her. Your third paragraph was you describing her trying to share her life with you and you making it about yourself and your own petty jealousies. You're right, it takes two people to bond. You were the one uninterested in that.  You\u2019re so clearly the one who rejected her. This is almost entirely your fault (and probably your mother's for raising you to be this way).\n\nThen you are surprised she is no longer paying for the dress after you accused her of lying merely because you decided to willfully misunderstand and fail to clarify what her help meant?\n\nAlso \"all the wedding planning.\" Let's be real. You just said you don't have money to pay for this. You never asked her or discussed an explicit budget with the person you were delusional enough to think would be funding it. So that planning was merely you dreaming. We don't actually believe you invested enough time to secure a venue, order invites, etc. Those things cost money, which you've clearly indicated you don't have. The only thing she has \"taken\" from you is your delusional fantasy. You never were planning a realistic wedding and if you truly thought she'd be helping financially you would have discussed a budget before you started to plan. Your \u201cwedding planning\u201d is the equivalent of the average Joe looking at 14 million dollar homes on Zillow and fantasizing about where they\u2019d put the couch. It\u2019s simply not real. \n\nYou can't convince anyone you were dumb enough to think otherwise. If you actually thought she was paying for it you would have discussed amounts with her before \u201cplanning.\u201d \n\nYou know how traditionally you aren't supposed to say congratulations to a bride because congratulations insinuates that it was not a given that the bride would succeed at getting married? I think you're the exception to that. You've shown yourself to be a pretty awfully behaved person so I truly congratulate you on finding someone else who is willing to marry you. In your case that likely is quite an achievement. Furthermore, I congratulate you on being short-sighted enough to alienate a step-sister who is affluent when you sound less than financially secure and like someone who makes some poor financial choices. You pretty much ensured you can't ever ask her for help one day, even if you have an actual need like impending homelessness. Furthermore, she's likely the one whose going to be helping your parents as they age (at least financially) and whatever you manage to inherit from them is likely subsidized by the gifts she has given them (the same ones you took offense to). She's now just realized that you aren't capable of being a good \"sister\" to her, so you got your wish and I doubt you'll have to see her buy you many expensive presents or try to be your friend again. Caring for your parents with her as you both age is going to go poorly for you, since she now knows you're a bit of an entitled gold-digger and that you see her as a chance at getting money rather than a sibling.\n\nMeanwhile, your mom is already alienating herself from her as well. So don't be surprised if your mom/ her step-mom pays a price for this later. Nor should you be surprised if your step-father continues to be disappointed in you. Most well-adjusted parents would be deeply ashamed to have raised such a daughter. \n\nIt's so apparent to anyone reading this that your problems are entirely of your own making (you didn't care to get close with her, you fought with her over how she spends her money, you asked her for help inappropriately and failed to clarify what that help would entail, you weren't grateful when she still offered to pay for the dress, etc.). You were an asshole to her, but you also shot yourself in the foot here. While I wouldn't normally confuse education with intelligence and there is nothing wrong with not going to college, it's not surprising that she's been more successful than you. This whole thing demonstrates a profound shortsightedness on your part.\n\nI predict you're going to get precisely the wedding you deserve and I hope your step-sister takes herself out for a very nice meal instead of attending (probably nicer than anything you're going to be able to serve at that wedding of yours).", "YTA. This has to be fake, I can\u2019t believe anyone is as dense and entitled as you look in your comments", "YTA\n\nThis is entirely on you for planning without clarifying how much \"help\" was available and budgeting accordingly. \n\nShe owes you exactly nothing and buying your dress is a very generous offer.", "YTA she didn\u2019t lie - she said she would pitch in and you thought you could now plan your dream wedding.  It\u2019s mismatched expectations - you can\u2019t demand anything here, it\u2019s her money.  It sounds like you are jealous of her success - that is on you.  \n\nApologise for your misguided assumptions, and be grateful for a reasonably priced dress if she is still offering - make sure you understand what the budget is before you look at designer dresses\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nBe happy with the wedding you can afford - no one else is obliged to pay for your fantasies.", "YTA.

You heard she will pay for all of it or most of it though not uttered. Her mistake was not telling you how much. But the bigger mistake is your taking it for granted your dream wedding with no thought about expense for her. She got it to help on the dress and you blew that offer by acting entitled.

(So far, it sounds like you're seething with jealousy.) Next, you ask her to pitch in for your wedding since she earns so much. At the time, she agrees to pitch in. Then, you made the leap to decide that she'll be funding (most) of your dream wedding, I'm assuming, because \"she has the money\" and you've said you & fiance aren't high earners. And when you present her with the high price tag & she asks how you're going to fund it, you get upset & remind her that she offered to help?? (Your definition of help is apparently to give you as much money as you need & that is not even close to the actual definition btw.) Despite the entitled attitude you display, she then graciously says she might be willing to pay for your wedding dress. You then start a fight because you have made up in your own mind that she offered much more previously. And now you're upset that she won't even pay for the dress?!?! Omg, OP!!! Get over yourself!

He had a daughter from a previous marriage, Ellie (F29). We were never close because when they moved in with us Ellie was super super clingy, would always follow me around and basically stalk me in my own home. Your typical know-it-all, barely left the house, so basically had zero friends that werent online. \n\nSo Ellie managed graduate early and get into a really good college on scholarships, then got a masters there as well. Shes in engineering and her college is like apparently one of the best ones for engineering. So straight after graduating she was earning a crazy amount. \n\nShes been rubbing this in my face ever since she got the acceptance letter, when she was home she was always wearing the university hoodie, always talking about what shes doing at college, sending videos of robots and shit into the family groupchat. Now that shes earning so much its shit like her paying off our parents car loans for christmas or getting extravagant gifts for everyone. We had a few fights about it but we always made up.\n\nSo now onto this year, I got engaged last year in february to my fiance (M32). I asked my sister if she would pitch in and she said she would help out. Knowing she had the money I got to plan my dream wedding, I was so excited about planning our big day. That was all until I showed her the plans and she pulled the rug from beneath my feet. She asks me how Im paying for it (my husband and I didnt do college so are not high earners) and I reminded her that she said she would help. Shes now saying that she wont help pay for it and she will at the absolute most pay for my dress. I told her its unfair of her to lie to me and only tell me after planning everything that she isnt actually going to help. \n\nShe blew up at me over us not being close in the past and blaming me for it. It takes two people to bond. But she claims everythings my fault. We argued for a bit and now shes not even paying for my dress. All the wedding planning Ive done has been for nothing now. My parents are split, with my mom saying Ellie needs to honour her word and let me have the wedding I planned and we all pitch in what we can afford. My step-dad is angry I asked her in the first place and dug up some old arguments from when I was 17.\n\nAita for expecting her to do what she said?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "This is very baity...", "YTA. You don't respect her profession, her academic achievements or are even pleased that your parents have loans to worry about because of her incredible generosity. From the sound of it she tried to bond with you when you were both younger, you didn't respond (still calling her clingy and stalker etc.). After all this, you didn't even wait for her to offer a present, straight up asked her if she could pitch in (which is so demanding and ungracious) and she must have been forced to give a vague answer like she would pitch in. \"Pitch in\" means to help with minor costs like invites or a cake etc. Her paying for your dress is so generous! \nI find it unbelievable that you unilaterally decided that it was her sole duty to spend her earnings on your wedding extravaganza, after she made that money following a life of hard work: early graduation, scholarships and a STEM career. God, no wonder her father is so annoyed, any parent would be if they saw their child being belittled, mocked and then used as a cash cow at the same time. \nOP, please get a reality check. Weddings are meant to be special because of the commitment you make to your partner, not the expenses involved: a day that you can look back on fondly with your friends and family. Stop falling prey to the wedding industry's marketing bullshit, plan a wedding within your means that you can be proud of organising with your hard-earned money, and APOLOGIZE TO YOU SISTER. Maybe take her out/cook her dinner and express genuine interest in her work and vocalize how much you appreciate her and her achievements. Tell her you would like to build a genuine unconditional relationship going forward, that you understand if she no longer wants to even attend your wedding but you will spend the  next few years trying to earn her trust and respect.", "I'm sorry you hated the fact that she has money and paid off your parents loans, got expensive gifts for them\u2026 etc. Now you want her to use that same money for your benefit? You're bold cause I would have been so embarrassed to ask. \n\nThe worst part of all this is that you asked for help and expected you could take advantage of her and plan your dream wedding on her dime. Did she say she would pay for the wedding or help out? 2 different things, helping out could be as simple as paying for the catering, pitching in a few hundred on the venue\u2026But helping out doesn't equate to paying for the entire wedding. Sorry you and your fiance need to pay for a wedding you can afford. Lmao crazy", "YTA, but this has got to be fake. No one can be this oblivious", "YTA. And absolutely the only one. You did not show any compassion to your step sister at all when she were young. You said she did all the weird thing when they moved it. She was only 11 at the time so of course she might looked up to you and see you as a big sister. You basically punched her out. Maybe you had your reasons but of course we don\u2019t know that. \n\nThen when she got into good university, instead of being happy for her you were just jealous. She was maybe just proud of herself and wore hoodies around the house and you saw it as she was rubbing it into your face. She studied hard to get there, what did you do?\n\nShe was nice to say that she might pitched in for your wedding. But honestly, you were so selfish and didn\u2019t even say no or how much but just assume that she has all the money and you will just get your dream wedding. Why should we pay for your wedding? Should we pay for your dream car? Your dream house? \n\nIf I were her I would not help even one cent knowing this is how you feel about her.", "Wow the entitlement coming off you reeks. First of all she didn't have everything handed to her she worked her ass off to first of all get those scholarships and then to pass her degree and make the connections for her future.

You don't deserve it", "So let me get this straight.

Buying your dress is extremely nice and expensive, that is helping.  \n\nYou have wrote nothing but horrible things about her so I can only imagine what you\u2019re like in real life to her.

She said she'd help. Not that she'd act as your personal limitless ATM.\n\nHeck, did you even clarify what type of help you were asking for? Or how much she was willing to give?

I wouldn't assume they were expecting me to subsidise the whole damn thing.\n\nYour lack of communication and dehumanisation of your sister isn't her fault. She doesn't owe you any money. You should have budgeted. Even if she were definitely offering monetary help, you should have clarified how much and budgeted accordingly, instead of acting like the only limit was your imagination.

You plan the wedding you can afford, not your sister. Your mother is just as bad and I can understand where your entitled attitude comes from. \n\n>wearing the university hoodie, always talking about what shes doing at college, sending videos of robots and shit into the family groupchat\n\nThat's what people do when they're in college and proud of their work.

It's always so annoying seeing people who aren't wealthy at all, get married and get upset that they can't throw their extravagant \"dream wedding\" even though it's their fault they can't afford it.

We had a few fights about it but we always made up.\n\n>So now onto this year, I got engaged last year in february to my fiance (M32). I asked my sister if she would pitch in and she said she would help out. Knowing she had the money I got to plan my dream wedding, I was so excited about planning our big day.
