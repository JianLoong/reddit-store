I guess if SIL pushes it, then she's just asking to be embarrassed in front of everyone and hopefully that would shut her up.", "NTA I would do one of the following depending on my mood:\n\n- plate the food \n- put the larger bowls under a non-toxic potted plant\n- make sure the bigger bowls are dirty when she comes over \n- give the bigger bowls to the cat and comment it's to avoid whisker fatigue \n- use the bigger bowls for serving side dishes \n- set the table with the correct tableware\n- when she goes to the cupboard say the dinnerware is already out\n- casually block the cupboard with the bigger bowl \n- use the bowls for keys or other items\n- remind her that X number of people need to eat so she can only have 1/X of the food\n- cheerfully point out how many of each item I prepared for each guest\n- start a conversation so she is the last to get her food (then she can take the rest without issue)\n- be silently mad and hope she senses it and changes it without me saying anything", "NTA. Going into someone's cupboard to grab a larger bowl is an AH move. It's a double AH move to take more than anyone else and not finish it. I suggest you start evenly portioning food between however many guests you have and letting anyone know who finishes their food there's more if they want some. I would not leave the extra food out in the kitchen, have it put away in the fridge by the time SIL gets there if you even want to keep inviting her.

I'd prefer you use that. Thanks!\" Be calm and cheerful.

Just \u201chelp\u201d her out - if she says she wants more, then tell her (like you would a 5 year old child): \u201cstart with this, if you want more when you\u2019ve finished then you can come back for seconds.

She is greedy.", "NTA but this is one of those things where you'd be better off just letting it go and not starting an argument. She's overstepping but there's very few ways calling her out on it ends well and lots where it ends poorly. So make sure it's really worth making a whole thing of. SIL is being very rude and there's a natural urge to start drama over it, but there's a reason most families gloss over behaviour like this. There's a lot of ways you become known as the person who's obsessed with bowl size instead of her becoming known as the selfish person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
