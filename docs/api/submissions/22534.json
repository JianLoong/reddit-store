He makes just under 100k which is about double what I make. He has bought formula for her. I thought where we get along well it was unnecessary to go the legal route and would only rock the boat. When I went back to work we agreed we would split the cost of daycare 50/50. So far I've paid it all. This is where the issue began.

I totally understand that is the reality for many people right now and I'm not out for him to finance my life or anything like that.\n\nBut he bought a new 'luxury' vehicle shortly after telling me this. I tried to have a discussion about the fact I need his help with daycare costs and how I think that's a very fair ask. His response was that because I don't pay a mortgage(inherited home) I don't quite understand the struggle. This of course ticked me off because I certainly can't afford to go buy a third very expensive vehicle mortgage or no mortgage.. I also am the primary caregiver, he has 24 hours a week as per his work schedule availability but I too have to work full time and still parent.\n\nUpon advice from other people I've decided it probably is best to have a legal agreement done and to file for child support. Many of my family members think I'm being too nice and in turn being taken advantage of. I feel like he knows a healthy coparenting relationship is important to me and holds that over my head a bit. He is very very upset at the prospect of having to pay court ordered support because he says they will suck him dry. Not at all what I want or how I think they figure it out.

If he didn\u2019t want to pay child support, then he should have been more careful to not have a child. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about your friendship with him either.

Child support is there to help take care of the child and pay for her needs. It sounds like the father is chipping in and contributing when and how he sees fit - and nowhere near enough money.

This isn\u2019t about rocking the boat or playing nice.  \n\nIf your daughter\u2019s father is such a great co-parent, he would understand that daycare is a need, not an extravagance. $430 is no where near his 50/50 share.\n\nYou need to go through the courts so that it will be official and binding. The amount is determined by an impartial judge based on income, and he can petition the courts if his situation changes. \n\nAs a parent, you will find it is much easier to set the rules and be consistent than to try to adjust along the way. It is the same for your daughter\u2019s father and his expectations as a parent. \n\nTen months have passed, so it may be difficult at first. It will be much easier now than when she is ten.

Your child deserves that the people who brought her into this world support her to the extent they can. Not just what you can manage on your own and little bit of formula from him. He owes HER money for food, clothes, education, medicine - everything she would have gotten if she was being raised by him. By not filing, you are interfering with her right to those resources. Instead of all of your money going to necessities, she might have activities, a vacation, a higher standard of living like the one that she could have had if she had been born into and raised in a two parent household with an income of 100+ thousand dollars. \n\nIf he is holding a respectful or non-hostile relationship over your head to keep from paying, look again because your relationship is already hostile on some level.

I understand your desire to have a friendly relationship with him for your daughter\u2019s benefit, but at some point, overlooking these kinds of flaws will not benefit her. Children deserve to be raised in a financially stable environment where possible, which means you should be able to put some money away for emergencies and be saving for her future. That means he needs to be dedicating more than roughly 0.5% of his annual salary toward raising his daughter. To be blunt, you\u2019re approaching asshole status toward your daughter by waiting this long to file. Again, I understand your motivation, but this is your child\u2019s wellbeing on the line. You can\u2019t leave that up to chance. Furthermore, we live in a society wherein mothers are expected to sacrifice way too much of themselves in order to facilitate the largess of fathers, and mostly because they\u2019ve been conditioned from day one by patriarchal norms. At ten months, she\u2019s obviously not aware that her father is neglecting his parental responsibility, but before you know it, she will be picking up on dynamics she can\u2019t even quantify. She deserves to be shown a dynamic wherein her mother isn\u2019t submitting to such antiquated ideas so her father can drive a nice car (or three nice cars). She deserves that example so that when she is grown, she doesn\u2019t fall into the same cycle.", "Not at all, but you would be totally TA if you didn\u2019t file for child support.
