We've done well at the whole coparenting thing for the most part, and even when it's been hard I've tried to always do the right thing for her.\n\nShe's ten months old and in her whole life he has paid me $430 dollars in support. He makes just under 100k which is about double what I make. He has bought formula for her. I thought where we get along well it was unnecessary to go the legal route and would only rock the boat. When I went back to work we agreed we would split the cost of daycare 50/50. So far I've paid it all. This is where the issue began. He said with the cost of living increases and such he is struggling a bit. I totally understand that is the reality for many people right now and I'm not out for him to finance my life or anything like that.\n\nBut he bought a new 'luxury' vehicle shortly after telling me this. I tried to have a discussion about the fact I need his help with daycare costs and how I think that's a very fair ask. His response was that because I don't pay a mortgage(inherited home) I don't quite understand the struggle. This of course ticked me off because I certainly can't afford to go buy a third very expensive vehicle mortgage or no mortgage.. I also am the primary caregiver, he has 24 hours a week as per his work schedule availability but I too have to work full time and still parent.\n\nUpon advice from other people I've decided it probably is best to have a legal agreement done and to file for child support. Many of my family members think I'm being too nice and in turn being taken advantage of. I feel like he knows a healthy coparenting relationship is important to me and holds that over my head a bit. He is very very upset at the prospect of having to pay court ordered support because he says they will suck him dry. Not at all what I want or how I think they figure it out. I just want him to help financially even if at this point it ruins the good 'friendship' we have.\n\nSooo am I the asshole?

He has already soiled the co-parenting relationship by not co-financing it with you. He could have avoided the legal route by voluntarily paying his share instead of making excuses. It has nothing to do with you not having a mortgage, he is just conveniently using that fact to try to justify his not paying for his kid.\n\nThis is exactly why the legal system exists. Use it.", "NTA. Child support isn\u2019t about you (or him). It\u2019s about, and for, the child. And, yes, you should have a legal arrangement for child support, it helps protect both parents and the child. And don\u2019t let his whining about it draining him dry sway you. If he didn\u2019t want to pay child support, then he should have been more careful to not have a child. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about your friendship with him either. He\u2019s already ruined it by trying to get out of taking care of his child. It\u2019s more important to make sure your child is taken care of than to spare his feelings.", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t seek child support. That money is for your daughter. It\u2019s selfish of you to deprive her of it without a good reason.", "NTA\n\nGo get what you are owed. He is 100% taking advantage of the situation and counting on your desire to not rock the boat.", "NTA. He is currently taking advantage of you", "NTA. Child support is there to help take care of the child and pay for her needs. It sounds like the father is chipping in and contributing when and how he sees fit - and nowhere near enough money. Your child isn\u2019t even a year old and he is reneging on paying for child care in favour of buying a luxury vehicle. What\u2019s next? He won\u2019t buy her clothes because he wants a vacation? He meets a new girlfriend who wants to spend all his money? Nope. Nope. Nope. Seek legal advice and file for child support. He lost his chance at amicably sorting that out when he chose a car over daycare costs.\n\nAnd if the courts rule he owes you more than you need to pay for her? Open an account for her education funds for later. It\u2019s all money to help you take care of her. Raising a kid costs $1,000,000 (and more!) and he should be paying half that for the next 18 years.", "NTA. Child support is just that, support for the child. It isn't about either of you. Ensure that your baby is cared for.", "NTA That's his child too and he can start taking some financial responsibility. He's made it clear he's not going to contribute unless he has to.  Be ready for your relationship as coparents to change, but the money will help provide for his and your child.", "NTA. You need to ensure that you have all the means to provide for the baby. Child support still isn\u2019t 50/50 and never will be.", "NTA and you know where your child is on his priority list - right below the luxury vehicle.", "Are you an asshole for wanting to ensure your daughter doesn\u2019t go without?\n\nThat\u2019s the real question.\n\nThe answer is no, of course not.

This isn\u2019t about rocking the boat or playing nice.  \n\nIf your daughter\u2019s father is such a great co-parent, he would understand that daycare is a need, not an extravagance. $430 is no where near his 50/50 share.\n\nYou need to go through the courts so that it will be official and binding. The amount is determined by an impartial judge based on income, and he can petition the courts if his situation changes. \n\nAs a parent, you will find it is much easier to set the rules and be consistent than to try to adjust along the way. It is the same for your daughter\u2019s father and his expectations as a parent. \n\nTen months have passed, so it may be difficult at first. It will be much easier now than when she is ten. Best wishes! \u2764\ufe0f", "Definitely NTA", "NTA. You have to file for child support. Daycare is insanely expensive and he has to at least do half. Try to get family court mediation so it doesn't have to become hostile.", "NTA but you need to make an adjustment in how you think of this. Your child deserves that the people who brought her into this world support her to the extent they can. Not just what you can manage on your own and little bit of formula from him. He owes HER money for food, clothes, education, medicine - everything she would have gotten if she was being raised by him. By not filing, you are interfering with her right to those resources. Instead of all of your money going to necessities, she might have activities, a vacation, a higher standard of living like the one that she could have had if she had been born into and raised in a two parent household with an income of 100+ thousand dollars. \n\nIf he is holding a respectful or non-hostile relationship over your head to keep from paying, look again because your relationship is already hostile on some level. If he is any kind of father, he should want to care for his child and not leave her to made do with less than what he could provide her.", "NTA, but only if you follow through with this asap. He\u2019s contributed about $43/month since the birth of his child. There\u2019s a word for that. It\u2019s deadbeat. I understand your desire to have a friendly relationship with him for your daughter\u2019s benefit, but at some point, overlooking these kinds of flaws will not benefit her. Children deserve to be raised in a financially stable environment where possible, which means you should be able to put some money away for emergencies and be saving for her future. That means he needs to be dedicating more than roughly 0.5% of his annual salary toward raising his daughter. To be blunt, you\u2019re approaching asshole status toward your daughter by waiting this long to file. Again, I understand your motivation, but this is your child\u2019s wellbeing on the line. You can\u2019t leave that up to chance. Furthermore, we live in a society wherein mothers are expected to sacrifice way too much of themselves in order to facilitate the largess of fathers, and mostly because they\u2019ve been conditioned from day one by patriarchal norms. At ten months, she\u2019s obviously not aware that her father is neglecting his parental responsibility, but before you know it, she will be picking up on dynamics she can\u2019t even quantify. She deserves to be shown a dynamic wherein her mother isn\u2019t submitting to such antiquated ideas so her father can drive a nice car (or three nice cars). She deserves that example so that when she is grown, she doesn\u2019t fall into the same cycle.", "Not at all, but you would be totally TA if you didn\u2019t file for child support. My family\u2019s income is about the same as you and your ex, and almost all of it is for my family including my kids. Duh. It\u2019s called being a parent. You should get about 15-20k in support with his income. He should be paying all of her daycare costs if she lives with you. If he is afraid of a Court order that tells you all you need to know. Do it. For you and your child\u2019s sake. It will be one of the best decisions you can make.", "Na he is being an ass go to court", "NTA it's not much of a friendship if the basis of it is him getting away without paying a dime. Go get him.", "NTA. Both of you made the choice to have the child. So, both of you should share the responsibility of raising the child and making sure she is cared for her. Obviously, if he does pay child support make sure it\u2019s used for the child. I have seen multiple cases where one parent uses the child support for themselves", "NTA. I understand wanting to stay on good terms, but he is not behaving in a friendly way. He's taking advantage of you and is cheating his child by not paying his share.  It sounds like he's trying to play you here, knowing full well that he is not supporting his child like he should.  \n\nI think you should definitely get something legal set up.  He wants you to feel guilty which is a pretty crappy thing to do to you.  It says a lot about what kind of person he is.  You have nothing to feel guilty for.", "NTA. file for child support, if he doesnt pay willingly than they will garnish his check and/or tax returns. my sons dad didnt want to pay either and every year I get his entire return and I got every single stimulus check of his from years ago", "NTA he needs to realize that he no longer has HIM money. He has him AND child money. He needs to grow up.", "NTA. You're getting along well because he's happily playing you for a sucker and counting on you to not rock the boat. Go get your child support, and don't let him treat you or your daughter like doormats.", "NTA and get a wage assignment the second he doesn\u2019t pay the required amount on time. My ex told me I would have to wait for my child support because he had to pay bills, and in the next sentence told me he wouldn\u2019t be taking our child the next week because he was going on vacation. I filed for a wage assignment and it was granted. The money is taken directly from his paycheck now. Don\u2019t be nice if he gives you a sob story.", "NTA, you owe it to your daughter to pursue child support. Your lack of mortgage and his new car are irrelevant here. He has responsibilities towards his child. You also need to go to court for a custody arrangement, otherwise things can get very ugly.", "Child support is not for you and isn't contingent on whether you're nice or not; it's what parents pay according to their income for the benefit of their child.\n\nIf you don't file for child support, you're depriving your child of something to which they're legally entitled and would benefit them.  (Heck, if you don't need the money for day-to-day, you could put it in a college fund.  Of have savings in case your child has an emergency.)\n\nYour ex is not living up to his financial responsibilities, and you're letting him get away with that.  Stop it!  Get yourself a lawyer right now and file for child support and anything else to which your child is entitled.  Try to get an agreement that will help pay for college or voc training after your child is 18.  Get what your child deserves.\n\nMaybe you're being nice to your ex, but you're doing it at the literal expense of your child.\n\nYTA.  File.", "NTA", "If he doesn't have money it makes you an a-hole, If he does then it doesn't. \n\nHe should be supporting your kid if he has the means too however I feel you should have picked a better individual for your child instead of throwing your cat at a deadbeat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They look at his income and then have him pay a small percentage to you. Depends on the state but the average is about 15%.

Stop thinking about him so much and worry about what your child needs. Goto court and get child support.", "He can file for custody anytime, whether or not she files for child support. If she has evidence of his previous lack of effort at child support, that would weigh against him getting custody, I'd think?", "Did you mean NTA? OP asked if they were the AH for seeking child support through the courts.", "Under no circumstances is she an asshole for expecting the child\u2019s father to pay for his share of the child\u2019s needs.

Also if he pays child support please be prepared for him to be in the child life way less or not at all.

You don't have a healthy co-parenting relationship when one parent is shirking his financial responsibility to the child. You don't have a healthy co-parenting relationship when one parent doesn't keep agreements, for example paying for half of childcare costs. Regardless of your inheritance, raising a child is expensive and both parents should chip in. If your ex isn't mature enough to uphold his responsibility then take him to court and let the state enforce it. He needs to step up and contribute to his child's upbringing. Your family is right: you've been way too nice. Stop letting him manipulate you and let the courts deal with him.", "Z", "NTA Honestly you would be a huge A to your child if you didn\u2019t get this sorted out", "Best practices is a court order. Even if he was generous as heck, it's still good to have this locked down.\n\nFor instance, from what I can tell, at least in some US jurisdictions, a child support order also covers you in the event he falls under a bus. His estate would have to pay it out, regardless of what other inheritance arrangements he may have made.\n\nYou really want all that kind of thing very clear. This is your child, to the best of your ability you should want their future assured. The law is there to cover exactly these kinds of eventualities.", "To add on to this, OP:  Accept the full court ordered amount and get it automatically deducted from his paychecks.  Don't try to be nice and accept a lower amount because you feel guilty.  You are entitled to every penny that the court orders and if you feel the amount is too much, then put any excess into your daughter's college/house fund. NTA", "Yes, this. He says they will suck him dry, that means he knows he has been severely underpaying. Also, OP is not doing this for herself. This is for the child and it needs to be done. This is the money the daughter owed. OP you are NTA and if you bend this time, he will have you on the 'good coparenting' leash and keep pressing until it will be completely irreparable anyway. He also isn't being a good coparent already. What kind of father cheaps out on providing for their child? He is not being a good father, the least you could get from him is the money your child is owed."]}
