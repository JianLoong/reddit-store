P(30ish) came with her boy that is less than 6, and I came with my 20m boy.\nWe met at a restaurant and started chatting after ordering. Everyone is laughing and we hear a loud fart coming from P. She got all red, but no one reacted, we all pretended we didn\u2019t hear anything. It\u2019s not a big deal.\nAfter we start eating my boy burped and farted, I found it hilarious as did everyone but P (she frowned) and said \u201cso rude\u201d. I ignored it and said \u201coopsie , sorry everyone\u201d and took my boy to the toilet. Upon coming back I overheard P saying I was so rude no teaching manners to my son. He is a baby so wth, also everyone but her laughed.\nAnyways, almost at the end of the meal. Her boy asks P to use the toilet like 4 times, and she brushed him off and said \u201cfinish eating\u201d. Well, he farted loudly (hope only fart). He looked super scared. So I said the same as I did with my boy \u201coopsie, it\u2019s okay sweetheart we don\u2019t mind\u201d. Oh boy his mom minded. She stated berating him, and saying he was filthy, and rude. She was being loud, mean and my baby was starting to be scared. I don\u2019t scream at him. So, I said \u201cP, is more rude to point out when someone farts by accident, or you think we didn\u2019t hear the loud fart your ripped when we first arrive?\u201d. She got red, paid and left. My friend K say I was rude for talking like that to her. But, she was rude and a hypocrite. I know I interjected on someone\u2019s parenting, I don\u2019t tend to do that, she was more mean than I can type here.
