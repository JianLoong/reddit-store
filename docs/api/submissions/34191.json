The father, \u201cAiden\u201d wanted to be around and was supportive from the start. We never got together but we became very close friends. Unfortunately, when I was 8 months pregnant, Aiden died in a car accident. It devastated me, as well as his family. To this day, it haunts me that he was never able to meet our son, \u201cBrady\u201d.\n\nAiden\u2019s family has been heavily involved in Brady\u2019s life since the beginning. Birthday parties, celebrations, etc. They always made me feel welcome. I started dating again when Brady was 2 and his parents, \u201cMichelle and Dan\u201d actually encouraged me too. They said I deserved to be happy. They even watched Brady occasionally so I could go on dates. Brady has always been told about his dad. \n\nWhen Brady was 4, I met \u201cJustin\u201d (now 31). It took 6 months for him to meet Brady and from the start, they bonded quickly. A couple of months later and Justin met Aiden\u2019s family. They loved him. I was always clear with Justin that their family would always be in our lives, especially for Brady\u2019s benefit. He agreed it was the best.\n\nI married Justin 2 years later. Brady began calling him \u201cpapa\u201d on his own. He still talked about Aiden and called him \u201cdaddy\u201d. I kept all pictures of Aiden up. Brady proudly said he had 2 dads. Michelle and Dan seemed fine. A year later, Justin brought up adopting Brady and I agreed. \n\nThat\u2019s when Dan and Michelle began to show their displeasure. I explained that we\u2019d never stop Brady from seeing them, we\u2019d always talk about Aiden, show pictures, etc. We also planned on hyphenating their last name with Justin\u2019s. Dan and Michelle argued with me. I tried to keep things calm for Brady\u2019s sake. But then Michelle and Dan tried to stop the adoption. It didn\u2019t work and the adoption went through. But because of their contesting, it took longer and only went through last year. It also added extra court fees.\n\nDan and Michelle have since accepted things, though I still won\u2019t leave them alone with Brady in case they try to trash Justin again. Justin is fine with them coming around for Brady and is cordial, but definitely keeps a wall up. He\u2019s not overly friendly like he once was. He\u2019ll smile, hype them up for Brady but that\u2019s it. He says he\u2019s upset with what they put all of us through, especially the emotional toll it put on me.\n\nDan and Michelle came by Christmas Eve to see Brady. Justin was once again polite but didn\u2019t say much. A few days later, Michelle told me she\u2019s hurt Justin\u2019s stopped making an effort. I told her she can\u2019t expect him to be the same after all they did and said in court. She said they apologized and he accepted it. I said yes but actions have consequences and they need to accept it.\n\nDan told me that I was insensitive to not take Michelle\u2019s side after all they\u2019ve done. Their daughter (Brady\u2019s aunt) tells me Justin and I are in the right. I don\u2019t know what to think and feel stretched between everyone. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: Some have asked what was said in court\u2026\n\nThey said he\u2019d be an unfit father, despite him having a job and a loving relationship with Brady. They also said that Justin was just after Brady\u2019s trust fund. For some context, Aiden was killed in a drunk driving accident. I took the driver to court and sued them for the damages of me having to be a single parent due to their negligence. All the money was put into a trust for Brady that he can\u2019t touch until he\u2019s 25. The overseer is also Aiden\u2019s sister so it\u2019s not like she\u2019d ever agree to sign it over to Justin. \n\nJustin has never shown interest and has money of his own. The judge threw it out for those reasons.\n\nThey called Justin a variety of names in court and tried to demean his character, calling him a child stealer, etc. This came after years of claiming they loved him and thought he was perfect for me, which Aiden\u2019s sister testified in court. They later admitted to me that they made all this up to try to stop the adoption and they never believed it.", "created_utc": 1704219288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ww1dy/aita_for_telling_my_sons_grandmother_that_she/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think their reaction was a bit much, but grief can make people do irrational things. Yet after all that, the only real consequence to them is that you and your current husband aren\u2019t bending over to be nice and build a relationship like before they dragged you to court to interfere with an adoption? In time, the frost will likely thaw a bit. But what did they expect? They made your life miserable. Despite all of that, you still have them in your child\u2019s life.

(I don't like what you son's grandparents did. But, I understand how things got out of hand quickly. And no one actually showed much respect or concern for the other's point of view.)\n\nIf your husband adopted their grandson, they feel their son is being erased.  It would be a hard jumble of emotions to process, is what I imagine? Changing your dear son's last name to incorporate your husband's probably slammed into their worst fears? \n\nAnd fear isn't rational.\n\nAt any rate, I also see you wanting to establish your new traditional secure parameters too. \n\nBut behaving like only the grandparents' behavior was excessive seems unreasonable to me. You hurt them. They responded to their hurts in an unwholesome manner, and it really is time for everyone involved to behave like adults for the sake of the child and the sake of sanity.", "INFO: did you actually hyphenate Brady\u2019s name as promised? \n\nIf not - erasing his obviously loving bio dad & Aiden\u2019s parents, is cold.

It\u2019s a natural reaction to being attacked.", "NTA.\n\nThey had no right to contest the adoption and now that they lost, MIL is all weepy about not being treated the same as before.", "NTA\n\nThe grandparents messed up and should really be gratful they still get to be in their grandsons life.\n\nAnd even though they apologized and he said ok, it dosen\u2019t changed what they did. He is being polite for his son and wife. \n\nGrief makes people do strange things, but I really think they oversteped and they was thinking about themself and not their grandson.", "NTA - This seems like a situation you have managed very well, and Michelle and Dan did at first but ultimately they have to deal with the consequences of their actions. This consequence means that Justin no longer views them favorably. \n\nMaybe that relationship can he prepared, maybe it cant, but you and Justin have been more than patient with them.", "NTA.  Accepting an apology doesn't mean someone has been forgiven.  Depending on what was said in court, they easily could have said something unforgivable.", "NTA.  Your mommy senses are right on target.  I think you're right to keep distance from them.  They went to through all the time and expense of contesting the adoption, but I'm betting their apology wasn't nearly as good.  They apologized to so they could keep seeing their grandson.\n\nOn top of that, Dan tried to manipulate you through guilt.  Not cool.", "Yta\nYou let them legally change his father so it might look like you want to erase their son..\nEven more with changing his last name\n\nI mean.. it makes sense now after so many years after his death\n\nBut for his parents it will always be different", "You are in the right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

On the other side I do think that your husband has a right to be annoyed with them especially as they never voiced the concerns or worries about him.
