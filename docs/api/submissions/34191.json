The father, \u201cAiden\u201d wanted to be around and was supportive from the start. We never got together but we became very close friends. Unfortunately, when I was 8 months pregnant, Aiden died in a car accident. It devastated me, as well as his family. To this day, it haunts me that he was never able to meet our son, \u201cBrady\u201d.\n\nAiden\u2019s family has been heavily involved in Brady\u2019s life since the beginning. Birthday parties, celebrations, etc. They always made me feel welcome. I started dating again when Brady was 2 and his parents, \u201cMichelle and Dan\u201d actually encouraged me too. They said I deserved to be happy. They even watched Brady occasionally so I could go on dates. Brady has always been told about his dad. \n\nWhen Brady was 4, I met \u201cJustin\u201d (now 31). It took 6 months for him to meet Brady and from the start, they bonded quickly. A couple of months later and Justin met Aiden\u2019s family. They loved him. I was always clear with Justin that their family would always be in our lives, especially for Brady\u2019s benefit. He agreed it was the best.\n\nI married Justin 2 years later. Brady began calling him \u201cpapa\u201d on his own. He still talked about Aiden and called him \u201cdaddy\u201d. I kept all pictures of Aiden up. Brady proudly said he had 2 dads. Michelle and Dan seemed fine. A year later, Justin brought up adopting Brady and I agreed. \n\nThat\u2019s when Dan and Michelle began to show their displeasure. I explained that we\u2019d never stop Brady from seeing them, we\u2019d always talk about Aiden, show pictures, etc. We also planned on hyphenating their last name with Justin\u2019s. Dan and Michelle argued with me. I tried to keep things calm for Brady\u2019s sake. But then Michelle and Dan tried to stop the adoption. It didn\u2019t work and the adoption went through. But because of their contesting, it took longer and only went through last year. It also added extra court fees.\n\nDan and Michelle have since accepted things, though I still won\u2019t leave them alone with Brady in case they try to trash Justin again. Justin is fine with them coming around for Brady and is cordial, but definitely keeps a wall up. He\u2019s not overly friendly like he once was. He\u2019ll smile, hype them up for Brady but that\u2019s it. He says he\u2019s upset with what they put all of us through, especially the emotional toll it put on me.\n\nDan and Michelle came by Christmas Eve to see Brady. Justin was once again polite but didn\u2019t say much. A few days later, Michelle told me she\u2019s hurt Justin\u2019s stopped making an effort. I told her she can\u2019t expect him to be the same after all they did and said in court. She said they apologized and he accepted it. I said yes but actions have consequences and they need to accept it.\n\nDan told me that I was insensitive to not take Michelle\u2019s side after all they\u2019ve done.

They also said that Justin was just after Brady\u2019s trust fund. For some context, Aiden was killed in a drunk driving accident. I took the driver to court and sued them for the damages of me having to be a single parent due to their negligence. All the money was put into a trust for Brady that he can\u2019t touch until he\u2019s 25. The overseer is also Aiden\u2019s sister so it\u2019s not like she\u2019d ever agree to sign it over to Justin. \n\nJustin has never shown interest and has money of his own. The judge threw it out for those reasons.\n\nThey called Justin a variety of names in court and tried to demean his character, calling him a child stealer, etc. This came after years of claiming they loved him and thought he was perfect for me, which Aiden\u2019s sister testified in court.

OP and Justin had told them that they would never be cut out of Brady's life \u2013 and they are clearly people of their word, since almost anyone else would have cut them right off after the absolutely indefensible things they said and did (in court, on the record, under oath). OP and her husband are already acting in Brady's best interests, as they clearly have all along; the only people who chose to act contrary to Brady's interests are his grandparents, and they cannot reasonably expect that a mere \"oops, we got it wrong\" will magically make everything go back to how it was before they viciously lied and attacked and defamed Justin in court. If they want to improve their relationship with OP and her husband, they could start by offering a genuine, abject, detailed apology, expressing their deep remorse for all of the terrible, hurtful, dishonest, self-centered things they said and did, and all of the negative effects their behavior had on OP, Justin, Brady (who, remember, *wanted* to be adopted by Justin), and their daughter \u2013 and, to demonstrate that they actually do understand the harm they did and the pain they caused, they should describe all the ways they hurt OP, Justin, Brady, and their daughter \u2013 and then they should completely reimburse OP and Justin for all the money they had to spend in the process of defending Justin against them in court.", "Share your last name?\u2026 does that mean he doesn\u2019t have his bio dad\u2019s last name anymore? was his dad the grandparents only son?

You already behaved better and with more compassion than most. And you are a great mother, putting your son first. NTA", "You did everything right and were very generous.  I would absolutely have done the adoption.  Your son has a family, sisters and a father.  Without the adoption all that could go away if something happened to you.  I adopted my kids (wife had two pre-same sex marriage) and my wife adopted the child I carried as soon as we possibly could so that their family could not be disrupted in the event something happened.  I do see how hard it must be for the grandparents - but feelings and trashing someone's reputation in court are miles apart.", "Naw, don't mind it\n\nThere's always someone like this\n\nYou and Justin? You guys are saints and have handled this perfectly", "To many people that\u2019s not the same, especially as your son likely won\u2019t have his kids have the same hyphenated name.  \n\nEither way, to them it\u2019s the end of their name.  Does not excuse what they did though.", "It\u2019s not the same name and you\u2019ll know it. Asshole", ".....but you say \"Justin brought it up....\"   \n\nThis is confusing.  A name change to hyphenate,  to change a name, etc. Could all be done without removing Brady's birth father from his record.  \n\nI understand there are character limits and each situation is far more complex and unique that could ever fully be put into a reddit post.  From what's posted, seems a little like something is missing. \n\nI'll be against the consensus and say soft YTA.  Removing one of Brady's dads from his records might come back to haunt you.", ">A year later, Justin brought up adopting Brady and I agreed.\n\nThat's why.

And in this sub, you know you're only getting the side of the story that makes the OP look good.\n\nYou said \"We did ask\" so I take it that you didn't have a one on one with Brady?  Just had him on the spot with both of you so he would feel pressure to say yes?", "This is my stance. I'm a big sports fan so the way I've explained something like this is, if someone disrespects me to me it's like getting a goal scored on me. \n\nEven if they apologize, unless they try to remedy the situation or show that the disrespect was unwarranted and try to make it up to me, in my mind the scoreboard will always read 1-0 for them. \n\nMichelle and Dan don't seem to have humbled themselves and remedied the situation in any way so obviously your current partner will always see the scoreboard against him.", "I want to know the answer to this one too. Beyond the emotional toll, they created a financial one too.

Definitely go nc.\n\nOriginal:\n\nI don't agree with this. The grandparents were absolutely really wrong for trying to stop the adoption and mistreating Justin. However, it's likely they mistakenly felt like they would be losing their closest connection to their late son if Brady was adopted so they panicked and reacted badly.\n\nAs the grandparents were good to Brady up until the adoption issue arose, I think it would be good for Brady if they had another chance to regain the close bond they had. But the grandparents should definitely apologize to OP, Justin, and Brady directly and demonstrate their sincerity.", "I suspect they weren\u2019t thinking about anything except \u201cif this adoption happens, it will erase our son completely.\u201d They weren\u2019t able to see past their own grief, not until their daughter forced them to the realization that they were destroying a lot of relationships in the process. Including the one they had with their living child.", "Yeah, but it completely takes off the bio father\u2019s name as if he never existed. When a child is adopted new birth certificates are issued with the new parent(s) in place of the biological one(s) and it doesn\u2019t indicate an adoption occurred.", "I'd like to know that too.  Why does a parent need to be erased for an adoption to go through, as long as there's evidence that they approve (i.e., uninvolved parent who is being forced to pay child support) or have passed away?  It doesn't make much sense to me.", "I can only speak from my personal experience, but when my brother died, it completely devastated my parents. I still grieve his loss, every day, but there is absolutely nothing that can replace the loss of a child. Nothing. Even if you have more children, that lost child is never replaced. If you become a widow you can always remarry, and although you only get one set of parents, if you are young enough like Brady is, you can get a pretty close replacement (or in this case a legal one). Yes, the grandparents caused OP a lot of emotional and financial hardship, but their actions came from such a deep sense of loss and grief, they did it in complete and utter desperation. It does not excuse their actions, but understanding why they made them is so important. They might not have the money to make OP whole. If they do it would be a great first step to mending things if they were to reimburse them for expenses of the lawsuit, but if they can\u2019t pay it back, they can\u2019t. Like I said, OP is NTA, but I don\u2019t think OP can emotionally put herself in the grandparents shoes. Nothing prepares you for the loss of a child, and nothing compares to it. It\u2019s absolutely world crushing and all consuming. Everyone could use a little grace in this situation.\n\nIf OP truly wants to move forward, and feel heard, she just needs to be honest with the grandparents about how she and her husband feels about the whole thing. They say they accepted the grandparents\u2019 apology, but they didn\u2019t really accept it. They should be honest and say an apology isn\u2019t enough and they are still very hurt by what they said and did and it will take (time, therapy, reimbursement\u2026 whatever) until they will be ready to accept the apology.", "No, we hyphenated it.\n\nLet\u2019s say Aiden\u2019s last name is Smith and ours is Doe.

There is zero problem with doing that, especially when the son wants his name to match his families name.

I was too emotionally exhausted to handle it anymore.", "It\u2019s not the same name. Everyone knows that. The fact she\u2019s so bewildered by what\u2019s happening makes her the asshole", "So they haven't actually done anything to make up for being massive assholes.

It sounds like they need to see some actual consequences for their actions.", "Then they have not finished making even a basic apology. Apology includes making amends for the damage done. They damaged your finances, they damaged their relationship with you, they damaged their relationship with Justin. Where are the amends? Apology isn't just \"I'm sorry\", it's acknowledging the harm done, showing genuine remorse, and taking action to mitigate the harm to whatever extent is possible. It may or may not be possible to undo the relationship damage. (Though it's certainly possible to try...) But they sure as heck have a clear way to undo the financial harm they did to your family. I get why YOU didn't pursue it. But that doesn't explain why THEY have not attempted to make this much right. I think you know in your heart why they haven't.", "She's not the one bewildered by what's happening.

What matters is she's NTA for telling the grandparents they FAFO and now their grandsons papa is going to be cordial and frosty, which in turn will affect how their grandson views them.

They were hurt and acted badly so are the bigger ah but I think you may have unintentionally stomped on their hearts. The adoption creates a nice little family picture for you.

The paper trail is small and limited to one document housed in one database under a single agency. Adoption itself is long, complicated, and diverse. When dealing with large populations, some information just needs to be simple. Also, US doesn\u2019t have national identification like some other countries. Adults have a couple of substitutes (driver\u2019s license, ssn, ect), but for minors birth certificate is the big one that will come up over and over again. So it needs to be simple, and it needs to be accurate.\n\nFor the surviving parent/child it\u2019s convenient because it alleviates the difficulty of constantly carrying around a copy of a death certificate when trying to prove guardianship -especially in situations like for OP where the parents may not have been married and the death certificate could be difficult to get a hold of. For example, if the mom wanted to take the child to get a passport, before the adoption there would have been a whole other set of paperwork to complete in order to prove the father\u2019s death.
