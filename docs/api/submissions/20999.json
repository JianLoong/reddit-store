This was out of your control.

Not that what she's feeling isn't valid or real, but it is likely that her hormones and depression could be out of this world after having the baby, which could make her emotions a lot stronger than she would normally feel when she's not in postpartum. \n\nIt's important to check in with her, and if necessary, both of you talk to a professional \u2764\ufe0f   Not as a way to wedge the two of you, or find whos right and whis wrong, but rather, to make sure she's getting the support she needs for healing physically and mentally, and so that you don't get steamrolled due to the pregnancy whiplash. \n\nMuch love to all 3 of you, and congrats on your baby's huge milestone!!!", "NTA\n\nHow the hell are you supposed to make your daughter wait to try and walk?

It might be worth a date night/ breakfast and a small conversation about how she\u2019s feeling, just reassure her that she\u2019s doing okay.
