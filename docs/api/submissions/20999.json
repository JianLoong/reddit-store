As a father of five, I can tell you there will be plenty of \"firsts\" to go around. Some you miss, some you don't.  I get the impression this is a first child, so just wait until the first word comes out. I kind of wonder how she'll react if (more when) that first word is da/dada/dad because it's much easier to say (and other sciency nonsense). I hope for your sake her head doesn't explode!", "NTA  When it happens, it happens.", "NTA\n\nIt's easy to say \"you should've waited for her to wake up\" or \"you should've woken her up if you thought she would walk\" but in the heat of the moment in moments like that, I don't see why anything else would be on your mind.", "NTA.  Both of my kids (one of whom took her first steps less than a month ago) seemed right on the verge of walking for weeks before actually doing it.  You can't possibly be held responsible for that being the exact time she succeeded.\n\nYour wife sounds like she needs more naps and to get better at recognizing her own emotions.  She sounds like she was disappointed and turned it into anger at you.  That's really not good.  You seem like a doting and great dad, and this was an extreme - and if she literally called you an \"asshole\" in front of a small child, very concerning for several reasons - reaction.", "NTA  imagine all the moms/dads at work missing out a loooot of stuff their kids are doing for the first time while they\u2019re earning money to buy food and pay rent. sad but it is what is is.", "NTA, it's unfortunate your Wife wasn't there, but you had no control on when your Daughter decided to take her first steps.", "What\u2019d she want you to do, pin your toddler down to the floor and scream for your wife because your daughter MIGHT be taking her first step?

Sucks for your wife missing it, but you don't hold back progress for a child who's ready.", "NTA \n\nYou were being a good father and engaging your child.

A great life lesson. /s", "NTA, it\u2019s hard to miss firsts though, i baby sat my granddaughter and after baby did first roll over for me, we decided I just wouldn\u2019t tell her, so she got all the firsts too", "NTA, your wife is just jealous/sad that she missed the 1st steps and you got to be apart of that.

I mean one parent is working and the other one is staying home. There are always first times one parents will see while the other one is busy, that\u2019s all I\u2018m saying.
