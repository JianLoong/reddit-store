This was out of your control.

Not that what she's feeling isn't valid or real, but it is likely that her hormones and depression could be out of this world after having the baby, which could make her emotions a lot stronger than she would normally feel when she's not in postpartum. \n\nIt's important to check in with her, and if necessary, both of you talk to a professional \u2764\ufe0f   Not as a way to wedge the two of you, or find whos right and whis wrong, but rather, to make sure she's getting the support she needs for healing physically and mentally, and so that you don't get steamrolled due to the pregnancy whiplash. \n\nMuch love to all 3 of you, and congrats on your baby's huge milestone!!!", "NTA\n\nHow the hell are you supposed to make your daughter wait to try and walk?

He literally only said that she called him an asshole. That\u2019s all. You\u2019re really coloring in the lines there. Again, I\u2019m not saying what she did was right.

Try to be accommodating about it.", "I think she was happy but the disappointment of missing it out was taking lead at that moment. I can see how she may be bummed out. Woman often take most of the childcare on them (not everywhere, but in a lot of cases there is more percentage of the care going naturally to mom). Taking care is often =work. I assume she was tired of all the work and the small moment she closed her eyes, she missed a big moment of her child's life.\n\nAlthough there are a lot of first moments, walking and talking are the major and very first ones your child will ever do. And one of them us going to come first and if you miss that, there is no re-do.\n\n Maybe she would've waited or woke her husband up for that milestone and maybe she expected the same.\n\nThough, I understand the father sure enough.  When you see your kid trying to do his first steps, you're so excited and it probably doesn't occur to delay that incredible moment for someone else's sake. \n\nI understand both.

Tears of the Kingdom. I am a proud gamer mum!)", "I'm gonna have to say YTA, because I get your wife's anger. Yes, you'll miss some milestones, but your wife was home, and would have had the option to witness this one, had you called out to her, or brought your daughter to her so that she could have woken up and witnessed it herself also.\n\nA baby's \"first\" is a big deal for many parents, and I'd argue that witnessing your baby take their first steps is one of the biggest ones (up there with hearing their first word). Your baby just reached one of her first and biggest milestones in her toddler years. It marked a significant change, and has just changed her entire world. She just, literally, took a step on the path towards a new/a more grown and independent her (thus so also taking a step away and changing from the more helpless and early/small baby you often think about when you see someone less than a year old). And there you were celebrating that and soaking it up all on your own without one thought going to your wife during this occation, when she was just some meters/rooms away. So yeah, I can completely understand why your wife is currently very unhappy with you.", "YTA. (Eta tl;dr: you aren\u2019t the asshole for enjoying the milestones, but I think you are prioritizing being right in a situation that I\u2019d guarantee is more emotionally complex than this. You are married parents. Work together here.)\n\nI am not saying this as if you are the worst person in the world, but I think the desire you have to be right in this situation where the mother of your child and your wife is clearly communicating she\u2019s hurt. Granted, that\u2019s a completely unhelpful way to communicate, but we wall have those moments. I would talk to her about this and communicate with her instead of bringing her a Reddit post to tell her how she\u2019s wrong for being upset about missing these moments. She shouldn\u2019t have called you an asshole, and she should apologize, but I think you both need to talk because this is more than \u201cyou are an asshole because you didn\u2019t wake me up.\u201d As a mother, I would have been devastated to miss those milestones for my first child (and honestly my subsequent children; it hasn\u2019t gotten old). My husband did put effort into waking me up, taking photos, or doing something to ensure that I could see because he knows how much it meant to me. I struggled really hard with a traumatic delivery and severe ppd. It was the beginning of the pandemic, my spouse is a Dr. and was gone 16 hour days. It was just me and our infant. I was struggling to find any joy in my own abilities as a mother and felt like a failure every day because I was so depressed that I considering ending my life to spare my family despite the fact that I showed up every day and have a beautifully healthy family now. So, once again, I don\u2019t think you are an asshole for taking in the moment and greatly enjoying it, but the fact that you are here posting about this instead of talking to her and trying to figure out the greater issue here makes you seem like an asshole. Your partnership as parents and spouses is going to matter more than being right or wrong in each outburst that happens in early parenthood. Studies show that marriages greatly suffer during this time. You need each other and she needs to communicate better, but you guys can do this together. You are a team and not enemies.", "YTA. You should have pushed her to the floor and screamed \"wait for mommy!\"", "Why didn't he shout of the mother when it looked like something was happening?
