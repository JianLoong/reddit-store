There\u2019s 4 of us in total (my fianc\u00e9 and I, and our 2 roommates who have their own rooms). We split all the bills four ways, which is fair. But I think rent should only be split 3 ways because we\u2019re not taking up 2 bedrooms, we have one. All of our belongings are crammed into one bedroom. So basically we\u2019re paying half the rent for 1/2 the space everyone else gets. When we first moved in one of the roommates wanted the bigger room (even though there is two of us and we previously decided that my partner and I would get the biggest room) I said that since we\u2019re being forced to pay half the rent for the same space we at least deserve the biggest room. It pissed my roommates off and they were mad at me for like 2 weeks. I want opinions because at first I didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong for thinking this, but now I kind of feel like an asshole for wanting to bring this up for re-discussion. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I wanna add and clarify: rent only includes rent. We pay utilizes, internet, trash, ect serperate (that\u2019s split 4 ways. We all have furniture in the common areas bc we didn\u2019t have all the furniture on our own, but together as a collective we furnished the house. Our bedroom is MAYBE 20sq ft bigger. Same sized closets, no bathroom in room, same distance from the bathrooms. The only difference is the maybe 20 sq ft (3 extra Ft on the length of the room)\n\nEDIT PT2: I\u2019m realizing 40-30-30 would be more fair, that\u2019s why I brought it here to get opinions. But the people making me out to be a mooch and a bad guy are confusing. I\u2019m not saying one of us won\u2019t pay rent, I\u2019m saying there should be a more fair split because we\u2019re paying for half of the house and we\u2019re barely scraping by while the other two pay 1/4 and are constantly having people over keeping us out of the common spaces due to awkwardness.", "created_utc": 1674466953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10j8plm/aita_for_wanting_our_rent_to_be_split_3_ways/", "score": 719, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your expectation that you are your fianc\u00e9 should only pay 1/3 of the rent combined despite the two of you making up 50% of the use of the kitchen, living room, bathrooms, etc is unreasonable. Their expectation that you each pay 25% is unreasonable when their 25% gets them a whole bedroom but your 25% only gets you half a bedroom. Their expectation that you not get the largest bedroom despite paying double the rent of the other two is fucking insane.\n\nSo what's fair? You need a split of the rent in which you, as a couple, pays more than 1/3 of the rent but less than 1/2, and which everyone agrees on. Unfortunately there's no easy way to work that out unless you can agree on the value of having exclusive access to each individual bedroom, and the value of shared access to the common areas of the house. (E.g. You might all come to an agreement that if your total rent is $3K/month, then the three bedrooms are worth $600 for the largest and $450 each for the other two, and the shared areas make up the remaining $1500 of the rent. So when two people occupy the largest bedroom, they'd pay $600 for that, plus half the $1500 value of the shared areas, for a total of $1350.)\n\nIf you don't want to do that math, about the only other fair way is to find a house with four equally sized bedrooms, split the rent four ways, and the couple has the option to share one bedroom while using their second one as an office.", "You are both the NTA, and YTA.

Lets say the rent is 1000 shared equally between the four of you its 250, shared between 3 its 333.33, that means an additional 83 on the rent.

Also there are online calculators that will do this math for you. You split and pay rent on the *entirety* of the space (refrigerator/cabinet space, bathroom, living room, etc), not just the rooms.

I don't think you should be paying 50%, but it definitely needs to be a larger amount than any single tenant.", "NTA also your housemates don't need to give you the silent treatment over finances. It's pretty acceptable from my experience for the couple to pay less per person, but more overall compared to a single room. If it was split 4 ways you would be paying for two rooms by the same logic. But you're not. You're getting one room. The rent also covers access to common spaces, so 40/30/30 seems very fair.

OP and her partner have one third of the sleeping spaces, so they shouldn't be paying half of the rent.  Couples tax?  Yeah that's dumb and not a thing and especially petty that you are penalizing two of the paying roommates for being a couple.

I personally feel that if you are a person.  No mater the relationship.  And, you are sharing space wirh other people.  You should be included as an equal on the rent. No matter were you sleep. You take up space in common area. I also think that if a significant other :moves in\". They are not to be \"being someone 's guest\" while staying 24/7 at the residence.  If you stay over half week . A day being 18 + hrs. You should be considered a person living there. The room mate with significant other should pay more", "YTA.  Just having the big room should mean you pay more rent. And the two of you take up space outside your bedrooms as well. So you should have to pay for the common areas.", "You (as a couple) paying half the total rent is unfair on you, because you don't get 1/2 the total space. However, you paying 1/3 of the total rent is unfair on your roommates, because that would mean you as a couple are paying the same rent as 1 of the other roommates, even though you're 2 people.

You definitely owe more than 1/3 of that. You\u2019re basically saying that your fianc\u00e9 should be allowed to live there for free because he sleeps in your room. By that logic, your roommate can put 3 bunk beds in her room and the 6 people staying there should only have to pay 1/18 of the rent. But you wouldn\u2019t want this because people also occupy the public spaces.  \nIn your edit, you say 40-30-30 sounds like a fair split. That could be reasonable if it was all agreed to agreed of time, but at this point why should your roommates agree to just start paying more? Just because you ask them? And at the end of the day, you\u2019re talking about saving an extra $170 a month, or $85 each. Is this really so much that it\u2019s worth fighting with your roommates about? And again, I don\u2019t know why your roommates would just agree to pay extra.", "Because those two people paying 20% only get half a bedroom each, whereas the two people who pay 30% get 1 bedroom each.", "You're bringing your relationship drama into the apartment by asking for them to subsidize your rent because you can't afford your bills.", "I\u2019m Norwegian and when I was a student i shared an apartment with three guys.
