There\u2019s 4 of us in total (my fianc\u00e9 and I, and our 2 roommates who have their own rooms). We split all the bills four ways, which is fair. But I think rent should only be split 3 ways because we\u2019re not taking up 2 bedrooms, we have one. All of our belongings are crammed into one bedroom. So basically we\u2019re paying half the rent for 1/2 the space everyone else gets. When we first moved in one of the roommates wanted the bigger room (even though there is two of us and we previously decided that my partner and I would get the biggest room) I said that since we\u2019re being forced to pay half the rent for the same space we at least deserve the biggest room. It pissed my roommates off and they were mad at me for like 2 weeks. I want opinions because at first I didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong for thinking this, but now I kind of feel like an asshole for wanting to bring this up for re-discussion.

Your expectation that you are your fianc\u00e9 should only pay 1/3 of the rent combined despite the two of you making up 50% of the use of the kitchen, living room, bathrooms, etc is unreasonable. Their expectation that you each pay 25% is unreasonable when their 25% gets them a whole bedroom but your 25% only gets you half a bedroom. Their expectation that you not get the largest bedroom despite paying double the rent of the other two is fucking insane.\n\nSo what's fair? You need a split of the rent in which you, as a couple, pays more than 1/3 of the rent but less than 1/2, and which everyone agrees on. Unfortunately there's no easy way to work that out unless you can agree on the value of having exclusive access to each individual bedroom, and the value of shared access to the common areas of the house. (E.g. You might all come to an agreement that if your total rent is $3K/month, then the three bedrooms are worth $600 for the largest and $450 each for the other two, and the shared areas make up the remaining $1500 of the rent. So when two people occupy the largest bedroom, they'd pay $600 for that, plus half the $1500 value of the shared areas, for a total of $1350.)\n\nIf you don't want to do that math, about the only other fair way is to find a house with four equally sized bedrooms, split the rent four ways, and the couple has the option to share one bedroom while using their second one as an office.", "You are both the NTA, and YTA.

If theyre going to pay for the bulk of the rent theyre better off getting a 1 bedroom it would be the same cost. The point of having roommates is to save money, how are they saving any money?? Theyre getting ripped off", "I think YNA but I hate roommates. Had them for only 3 months. After that only dated older women with there own place till I could get my own place.", "You say that, but would you agree to it after other terms had been agreed to and in place for some time?\n\nYou are 2 of the 4 people using the kitchen, 2 of the 4 using the bathroom, 2 of the 4 using the living room. Splitting the place 1/3 each doesnt seem right either. Thats why i said 40-30-30 seems more appropriate, but that isnt what was negotiated in the beginning. Consider it a bought lesson and do better next time.", "But the couple do have the biggest room\u2026", "We do have the biggest room, but it\u2019s only bigger by 3ft onto the length", "Mate I\u2019ve been on both sides of this coin. There is always a couples tax", "All of us do?", "Oh my mistake, I misread their post.\n\nI'd personally say them paying half is too much, but them paying 33% is too little. Due to taking up communal space etc. I think a fairer split would be along the lines of 40/30/30, say.", "Yep, which is why it would not be fair to act like you not having a bedroom to yourself is worth a 50% discount on rent. Your rent isn't only paying for the bedroom you use, it's paying for those common areas too, and your room-mates share them with both you and your partner (not just one of you). If you only paid half rent, then they get all the inconvenience of sharing a 3 bed household with 4 people, and none of the benefits.", "All good mate. I live a life full of mistakes"]}
