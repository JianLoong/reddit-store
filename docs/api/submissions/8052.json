There\u2019s 4 of us in total (my fianc\u00e9 and I, and our 2 roommates who have their own rooms). We split all the bills four ways, which is fair. But I think rent should only be split 3 ways because we\u2019re not taking up 2 bedrooms, we have one. All of our belongings are crammed into one bedroom. So basically we\u2019re paying half the rent for 1/2 the space everyone else gets. When we first moved in one of the roommates wanted the bigger room (even though there is two of us and we previously decided that my partner and I would get the biggest room) I said that since we\u2019re being forced to pay half the rent for the same space we at least deserve the biggest room. It pissed my roommates off and they were mad at me for like 2 weeks. I want opinions because at first I didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong for thinking this, but now I kind of feel like an asshole for wanting to bring this up for re-discussion. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I wanna add and clarify: rent only includes rent. We pay utilizes, internet, trash, ect serperate (that\u2019s split 4 ways.

Your expectation that you are your fianc\u00e9 should only pay 1/3 of the rent combined despite the two of you making up 50% of the use of the kitchen, living room, bathrooms, etc is unreasonable. Their expectation that you each pay 25% is unreasonable when their 25% gets them a whole bedroom but your 25% only gets you half a bedroom. Their expectation that you not get the largest bedroom despite paying double the rent of the other two is fucking insane.\n\nSo what's fair? You need a split of the rent in which you, as a couple, pays more than 1/3 of the rent but less than 1/2, and which everyone agrees on. Unfortunately there's no easy way to work that out unless you can agree on the value of having exclusive access to each individual bedroom, and the value of shared access to the common areas of the house. (E.g. You might all come to an agreement that if your total rent is $3K/month, then the three bedrooms are worth $600 for the largest and $450 each for the other two, and the shared areas make up the remaining $1500 of the rent. So when two people occupy the largest bedroom, they'd pay $600 for that, plus half the $1500 value of the shared areas, for a total of $1350.)\n\nIf you don't want to do that math, about the only other fair way is to find a house with four equally sized bedrooms, split the rent four ways, and the couple has the option to share one bedroom while using their second one as an office.", "You are both the NTA, and YTA.

Obviously a straight 3 way split wouldn\u2019t be fair anymore than the current four way split is.\nAs others have said  get the square footage of the house - calculate the cost per square foot based on rent you pay.

So each individual utilizing the common areas pays for them equally, but the one bedroom portion the couple splits between themselves. If that makes sense. It's pretty common sense but it can be confusing. With these numbers the two people with their own rooms would pay 787.50 total, and the couple would each pay 562.50 Everyone pays 337.50 for common areas. Which is 1350 divided by 4. The two people with their own rooms then add on 450 to their 337.50. The couple splits their 450 portion.

Then your two housemates add the amount for their rooms each and you both half each of your shared room. And there you go... all fair and square...

So whenever they did laundry it would take 2 dryer cycles for one load so that meant not being able to use it that night without waiting 7ish hours.  The kitchen only comfortably fits 2 people so when they were cooking it effectively blocked use of the space compared to just one person using it.  The living room had a 2 seat sofa that could fairly comfortably fit 3 but not so comfortably when 2 of the 3 are a couple snuggling so that was fun and they would always be in the living room together which mostly meant using the chairs pushed off to the side if they were in there.
