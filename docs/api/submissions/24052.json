Also I\u2019m curious to see where these sources are that don\u2019t list skin to skin as the cause of hpv as the reason why hpv is spread is because it lives on the surface of skin. \n\nHSV1 encephalitis can also be transmitted by birth. I am unfamiliar if kids who die of this are new borns or infants or children. That is percentages. It seems that the condition is more rare but I can research that further.", "Nope, still not weird. There is nothing wrong with a parent giving a peck to their child in a non sexual manner, as a form of affection. The only thing weird are the people sexualizing it. We aren\u2019t talking about child sexual abuse are we? We are talking about a completely innocent action of a 4 year old showing affection to her mother. This child isn\u2019t being sexually abused by her mother given the context. Also You can still teach your child what inappropriate touching and boundaries are. It\u2019s not mutually exclusive. I grew up with a family who showed affection that way, and still knew what appropriate and inappropriate touching was as well as boundaries. You find it weird, cool then don\u2019t do it with your children. Simple solution.  I don\u2019t always agree with what other parents do but I don\u2019t micromanage their decisions because that\u2019s not my place to. I also was abused sexually by an adult as a teenager so I don\u2019t appreciate your comments acting as if I\u2019m blind to the occurrence of child sexual abuse. I just find it wildly inappropriate to project your trauma onto others.", "It\u2019s because if you have hsv-1 of the mouth, it\u2019s likely to stay there and not also effect the genitals. It could\u2026 But it\u2019s less likely because it\u2019s so localized (probably what the courses were saying).", "If you were actually curious, you'd just Google it.\n\nAnd, yes, hsv1 can be transmitted from mother to child in utero or during birth - but those are kind of necessary for there to be a child in the first place and wholly irrelevant to the topic of mouth kissing your kid.", "i do think it's fucking weird. just like i think how Trump's dynamic with ivanka is creepy as fuck. but what do i know? i'm not a parent and apparently i just wouldn't understand.\n\nyou act as though this is a one-way street. you've responded with \"you find it weird, then don't do it with your children. problem solved.\" multiple times.\n\nyou're telling people that if they dislike something that's not their business, to ignore it and move on. yet you can't seem to come with terms with others disliking what you're doing. instead you get offended and think it's \"wildly inappropriate\" for me to \"project my trauma\" on a public forum.", "If you weren\u2019t interested in sharing information or sources you could have just said so. It\u2019s  weird of you to assume I didn\u2019t google it. I spent a literal year studying hpv and its transmission and was actually curious what source said it was not skin to skin at all. That source could be brand new or dated. \n\nRates of mortality and age do matter as if affects how you approach risk. If the number of children who get encephalitis are 80% newborns, then that dramatically affects how we look at risk of mortality/development in older children."]}
