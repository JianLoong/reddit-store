So, I dunno who you're arguing against.\n\nNot for nothing, since you mentioned significant harm, if you've ever had an actual cold sore, you have herpes. And if you kiss your child on the mouth, you can give them herpes, which - because of their underdeveloped immune system - can become herpes encephalitis, which has a roughly 70% mortality rate (though, they have anti-viral therapies that can help bring that down to 30%).", "this is coming from someone who was raised by a single parent \ud83d\udc80 I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH but OP adding the fact that she\u2019s a single parent was an irrelevant point in the story", "The plural of your anecdote is not data.", "Pass me the site that you saw those statistics on because I am curious", "Your sample size must be tiny. Also, are you spying on lots of kids with toddlers? Because that would be objectively weird.", "Live in the south. Can confirm.", "Bad bet. I take it you haven't seen her on TV on \"Countdown\" and \"7 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.\"", "And I could say that you including \u201ccoming from someone raised by a single parent\u201d is irrelevant to your comment. Everyone has different experiences with single parenting.", "To defend someone who was basically accused of a pedo / a \u201cweirdo\u201d ...you accuse others of being pedos and \u201cspying\u201d on children. \ud83d\udc80 yeah that makes sense", "Nah I\u2019m adding that bc I don\u2019t want ppl thinking I\u2019m some sheltered AH judging her for no reason- I\u2019m not saying parents should be perfect but saying that ppl should get a \u201cpass\u201d doesn\u2019t apply on AITA- it\u2019s a sub for judging actions that are objectively wrong. Which using the f word in front of ur kid is. Both ppl are technically wrong here one is just more wrong (the random lady)", "1 family? That's absurd. How many people have you met in your life?", "OP has already acknowledged that she shouldn\u2019t have sworn infront of her kid. She\u2019s not an AH for swearing, it was maybe immature but it doesn\u2019t really make her an AH (in my books anyways - with the context given).", "Many? I'm sorry you don't like how something super common for you is quite uncommon for others."]}
