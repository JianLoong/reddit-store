I still kiss both my parents on the lips to this day because I'm still comfortable doing so as an adult.\nI kiss my daughter on the lips all the time and she loves it. She will giggle and grab my face to plant a big wet kiss on my lips and it's one of those parenting moment that I cherish and enjoy. \n\nSo earlier today I was at the mall with my daughter and she wanted me to pick her up so I did and she did the face grab and kiss while giggling. Some woman about 10 feet away said \"what a weirdo\" while looking in my direction. I asked \"excuse me?\" I wasn't sure if she was talking to me. \n\nShe said \"You're a disgusting weirdo\" and when she was walking away I yelled \"Mind your f*cking business and get a life!\" and just walked off before I did something I would later regret.\n\nWhen I told one of my sisters what happened, she said that my reaction was too rude because it's possible that the woman just never had any affection from her parents so she's never been exposed to that sort of love. \n\nSo I don't know, was my action justified?

The fact that a kiss on the mouth immediately made someone think of lack of parental love is kinda weird. Like, emotional conversations, kisses on the cheek/forehead,  holding hands, hugs and a lot more are all ways to show love. Why would you assume lack of parental love because of a kiss?

I hope you don't kiss anyone ever, you might give them herpes.\n\nI'm sorry you don't understand how oral herpes is spread.
