We decided to have a weekly dinner with each set of parents so that we could see them regularly.\n\nMy parents get Saturday night. My sister, her husband and daughter also live in the same city and come to my parents house on Saturday as well so that we can all hang out\n\nMy MIL and FIL get Friday night. We spend our Friday evenings with them either at their house or ours\n\nFor a while now my MIL has been complaining about us giving my parents Saturday evenings. She thinks we\u2019re favoring my parents by giving them Saturdays. Her reasoning for wanting Saturdays is that it is one of her days off and in turn she would have more time to prepare a meal for us. She wants to relax all day and then have us come over \n\nCurrently my parents live 35 mins away from us on a good traffic day. If we were to go on any weekday evening it would take us upwards of 50 mins to an hour to get there. My In Laws live 10 mins away from us, it\u2019s much easier to go over on a weekday. \n\nMy mom does a fast for religious reasons every Friday and has for as long as I can remember. She only eats specific foods and has her meal about mid day therefore if we were to go over to my parents\u2019 house on Friday she would have to just watch us eat\n\nAlso we can\u2019t give my parents Sunday because we go to temple in the evenings.\n\nWe spend the same amount of time at each parent\u2019s house. We don\u2019t go to my parents house on Saturday and spend the whole day with them. We go there for dinner (about 2 hours) and do the exact same thing with my In Laws but on Friday and for the same amount of time\n\nI gave it a try though, recently we have given my In Laws Saturday nights every few weeks. Never has dinner been made nor any sort of special meal my MIL claimed she needed the time for. I'm in the kitchen still helping her cook every meal once we get there. We spend the exact same amount of time there as we would if it were a Friday night. Everything is absolutely the same. \n\nThis past week she complained again and I refused to give her Saturday. My husband agrees with my reasonings but he feels bad for her and thinks we should just do it for her. He thinks that I shouldn\u2019t be holding onto this too much and I should just deal with the driving and my mom not eating and go to my parents on Friday even though Saturdays also work for my sister and I get to see my whole family at once. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m being an asshole for not considering her feelings and not going to their house this past Saturday. I think the way things are (Fridays for my In Laws and Saturdays for my parents) makes it possible for us to have dinner and spend time with everyone, which was the point of all this in the first place \n\nAITA for not giving my MIL Saturday dinners?", "created_utc": 1683550321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bo6v1/aita_for_not_giving_my_mil_saturday_dinners/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re spending Friday with the in laws, Saturday with your parents, and temple on Sunday. Where\u2019s the time for you and your husband and nurturing your marriage?\n\nRegardless, NTA. But weekly dinners? That is *a lot* of family time.", "NTA\n\nBut I would alternate Saturday nights.  One Saturday with your parents, and one Saturday with your inlaws.  They can see you half the time instead.  \n\nThis will give you Friday night free to reconnect with your husband after a busy week at work.", "NTA. Stick to your guns! Never ever give in to whiny MIL pressure or she will push you around for the rest of her life. Tell her flat out that it's not going to happen, but if she doesn't like dinner on Fridays, you can cancel them altogether, but Saturday is at your parents\" house and that's that.", "nta. Never give in to whining.", "Nta. You see it right? Keeping things as are makes more people happy. Switching, Meehan\u2019s only MIL is happy.. and that is what your husband is suggesting.. just so we both are clear you husband is choosing his mothers happiness (even as you said you do the same things and actually have to help cook when MIL gets Saturday\u201d YET your husband still wants to give in and give his mother what she wants EVEN though he acknowledges I\u2019s not only easier but better since you get to se ruined whole fam in Saturday\u2019s. \n\nYOU HAVE A HUSBAND PROBLEM.", "ESH why not stop with weekly dinners overall, that would be way too much \"schedule\" for me and too little time for myself, myself & Partner and for friends.\n\nIf it were my mom I'd probably say, you know what lets not do any dinners for a while bc it is taking too much of my nerves right now.", "Your MIL should be grateful that you and your husband are willing to spend that much time with them. I\u2019m living in the same city with parents in-law and I\u2019m only having dinner with them once a month, twice the most. The rest of the weekends are just quality time between me and my husband.", "This seems way to rigid.  Spend time with people when you want to, not when you are obligated.   If you didn't have a rigid schedule, you wouldn't have issues.  Don't you have friends you want to spend time with? Or time with just your husband? Or just your sister's family?  Seems like it would be healthier all around to stop the dinner expectations.  Visit with each other when you want, don't always focus it on a meal.  Go to an event, go for a walk, to a museum, have brunch.  It is important to spend time with family (if you have the right family), but it also important to make your own life outside of family.", "I mean NTA.\n\nDo you think this attitude might come from you having weekly dinners in the first place?  That's very, very often.  You know the whole, give someone an inch and they will take a mile?  It might be your in-laws feeling more entitled to your time.  \n\nObviously, you know your in-laws better.  But I'd bet if you cut back on the dinners and said it was taking a toll on you, your MIL would be far less fussy on the days.  Same with if you stopped telling them when you were spending time with your parents.", "NTA AT ALL. Does she have any idea how lucky she is that she gets a set weekly dinner? She needs to get over it, and your husband should be taking your side here.", "Stop with these weekly dinners. Spend one Saturday per month eating with your parents, and two weeks later, one Saturday with his parents. \n\nThat way you all have a life during the weekends.\n\nNAH", "My goodness, that's A Lot of family time. Everyone every week.\n\n NTA\n\nSounds like she blanked out and forgot other adults make reasonable decisions and boundaries and how to respect them. Not everything is her choice and her way. Just hold the line. If she's not happy, maybe Friday nights become date night again! Or maybe it will click with her again that seeing you on Friday is really pretty great and it's wonderful you make time to see each other. \n\nYou are both logical and empathetic. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour current arrangement works best for the most number of people, you tried it her way and it didn't make a difference. She can ask, but shouldn't pressure you to change.\n\nMy in-laws are the same. They get jealous when we spend time with my parents and always set up scenarios where we have to choose between them, to see if we'll chose my husband's family over mine. They keep track of how many hours we are at each house.\n\nI don't think this is about convenience for your MIL. She wants to be the priority, to know you picked her over your parents / family. Don't give in. It won't just be Saturday dinners, it'll be something else, other occasions, other holidays, etc.", "The problem here is that is it NOT just about mil this involves EVERYONE and mil is ONLY seeing herself while hubby is ONLY seeing his moms pov.\n\nNot just about driving. About logistics. About food. About schedules. About who can do what. About how things are done.\n\nMight be time to sit hubby down and open his eyes to manipulation mil 101 style.\n\nNTA", "ugh, NAH but just do alternating Saturdays with each family", "ESH! I sound like you are spending the majority of your free time with you families. When do you spend time together as an actual couple? Consider alternating Saturdays with your respective families and use Friday nights for date nights with just the 2 of you.", "Why not have both families to your house on Saturday?", "E S H because of how much family time y\u2019all are having. I\u2019m getting anxiety just thinking about it. /s\n\nNTA. You have a well-reasoned solution that should make everyone happy. Maybe once every month or two you flip to make your MIL happy, but I suspect nothing will make her happy. Your husband needs to back your play though, so make sure y\u2019all are on the same page with whatever you decide", "NAH. \nI get what your MIL is saying too. It's fair that she doesn't want to work on Friday and then rush about preparing dinner every Friday. I think alternating Saturdays would be the best option for all concerned.", "How about you do dinners twice a month and have them on a Saturday for each family. I feel like dinner every week is a lot.", "How about you host everyone on a Saturday then you get to see your parents and sister, and your MIL shouldn't complain?", "Why do you not have time for yourselves as a couple? Once a month,  friend.  You guys need a life.", "YTA for refusing to compromise at all. Have you ever heard of Sunday brunch? You can see your parents occasionally on a Sunday. They could come to your house. \n\nYou're being inconsiderate. You're thinking about what's most convenient for everyone but your in-laws. You squeeze your husband's parents into your schedule when it works for you without considering it would be nice to see them when everyone can be well rested. Have you even considered inviting them to Saturday with your side of the family? You should have your husband's back on him seeing his family at a time that makes everyone happy too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Compromise would be to just have Saturday dinners and it\u2018s one week your family and the other week his family.", "NTA. How about having one big family dinner on Saturday nights (and not every one) and giving yourself some time alone with your husband.", "NTA", "Have you considered every other week with each family. Or maybe even just once a month? Quite honestly, this is maybe too much. When do you have time to do date night etc? Do you have kids? MILs point about working Fridays makes sense. Same with your moms fast. Both those are valid reasons to feel like Friday isn\u2019t a great day for anyone. Honestly, NAH but it kinda seems like your favoring your parents reasoning.", "NTA. Your reasons with the commute time and your mom\u2019s fasting schedule are reason enough, but you also have your sister and her family to consider. You want time with them too and they are there on Saturdays. Your MIL does not want to switch the schedule for any good reason but only to cause problems. Just say no and I would not even give her a Saturday every few weeks. If she complains about Fridays, then you can simply say you can go down to twice a month if every Friday is a burden on her.\n\nGood luck, and go over to the JustNoMIL sun because it sounds like you have one on your hands.", "NTA, but honestly all of this sounds like too much. \n\nI like the idea someone else suggested in the comments of alternating Saturdays between each set of parents, or picking two Saturdays per month for these parent dinners then having the other two Saturdays for you and your husband.", "This. How about alternating Saturdays between parents, and doing your own thing on Fridays?", "I have a pretty flexible work schedule and my husband doesn\u2019t have a 9-5 and can finish up his work in a couple hours so because of that we can make a lot time for each other during the week. We do do date nights, hang out, watch movies etc. but it\u2019s all mostly during the week. That\u2019s why we felt like we could give our parents some time during the weekends", "This is something we can also consider. We\u2019re thinking about just skipping weeks and not going to either parents house and just having these dinners every other weekend instead", "I was going to suggest the same.  Two family nights a week would drive me insane. \n\nEven one a week is triggering!! What if you want to go out with your husband on a Saturday and, you know, live your life?", "Completely agree with you.  Do they even have any other friends?!   This is way too much time with parents/in-laws when I have to think their friends must be like \u201chey do you ever want to hang out with us?\u201d Dial that way back to once a month on varying nights.", "Lol. I feel you. Not even sarcasm.", "This is something we can definitely do. We\u2019re also considering just skipping both families some weeks. It\u2019s all now becoming a little overwhelming and excessive and we don\u2019t want these dinners to start feeling like an obligation", "I second this idea. Dinner with both sets of parents every weekend is just so much.", "This is the best plan. Each set of parents gets one saturday a month, and then you get the other two Saturdays to yourselves. No matter how much you love them, going to see them every single weekend is going to become tiresome, just for having somewhere to be all weekend.", "Right? Somehow I get downvotes for saying the same thing.", "If instead of doing 8 dinners a month, you do alternating Saturday\u2019s , so it\u2019s only 4 days a month to visit in-laws & everyone gets 2x a month. Free up Fridays", "This would be a great idea. Once this starts to feel like an  obligation, resentment can build along with sucking the joy out of family time.", "That makes sense. Weekly would be too much for me. I'd personally do once a month. You're going to get push back but you and SO need to understand that your presence is now a reason for complaint and you're both being taken for granted. My mom acted like your Mil and caused a decades long family rift. Bite that in the butt asap."]}
