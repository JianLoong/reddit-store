Your reasons with the commute time and your mom\u2019s fasting schedule are reason enough, but you also have your sister and her family to consider.

I don't think the reasons here matter because none of the reasons seem more important than the other. A simple solution here is to simply rotate Saturdays in some way. Maybe every other. Maybe by the month. I don't know but that seems like a fine solution to me. Explain that both in-laws prefer Saturday for their own reasons and that you're going to split them up. After that there is nothing left for you to do and they can be mad if they want but as long as you're being fair and compromising here that's a them problem and not a you problem.", "NTA, and honestly, this is excessive.

I think you should to dinner twice a month on Saturday: Once with his family and once with yours. That is still way more than most people see their families, unless it is very different in your culture an I just don't understand. I'm not sure where you are from. Do you have any kids? If so, how is there any time for you and your partner? And if not, once you do, there is no way you will keep this up and then if the kids start doing activities... I think you need to reset expectations all together.", "NTA do not bend to this woman ffs.  And don't let your husband start taking her side on this.

We also have a social life. We see our mutual friends at least 2-3 times a month. He plays basketball with his friends pretty much weekly. I see my friends as regularly as all our schedules allow it.

Saturday at in laws, Saturday at your parents and two, foot loose and fancy free Saturdays with no flipping parents.", "TOO LATE, the fact that your MIL is kicking up dust about the specific night that you are there for that family time is the proof that is has already become an obligation. Curtail it and start to spend time on you and hubby (as Beck2010 stated) when is date night?", "Once a month would do.", "Doing every other Saturday honestly sounds like a great solution. This way both get Saturday every time and you get a little relief from constantly having to visit. I think there may also be a chance that your in-laws may be relieved it's not a weekly thing as well.", "I think because this is Reddit you are going to see everyone\u2019s internalized bias shining completely through.  For me, even before kids and their ridiculous extracurricular activities schedule, I truly don\u2019t think I could maintain my friendships, outside activities and work life balance if every weekend was a required two dinners with my parents and in-laws.  Heck, I don\u2019t even know when I\u2019d clean and maintain my house/apartment and food shop with that level of familial commitment.  \n\nSo I completely see your point.  There are definitely posters on here who come from the angle \u201cFAMILY=BAD\u201d but for me, I love them, but having a monopoly on my two free nights per week is way too much of a commitment.", "It may come as a surprise to you but plenty of us don't have great relationships with our parents!\n\nAnd also a lot of people need some downtime to relax at some point. Having plans every friday saturday and sunday would be exhausting for me.", "[removed]", "Sounds much better.  We do one family dinner per side per month.  That's plenty.", "and what would you or anyone else\u2019s relationship with their parents have to do with OP? \n\nthat\u2019s kinda my point, everyone\u2019s just projecting their own family boundaries onto this situation. None of anything OP said mentioned the weekly stuff being too much, the lack of downtime they feel, just trying to balance everyone else\u2019s feelings", "[removed]", "*laughs in close knit Catholic family*", "Except in comments OP does say it is a bit too much.", "[removed]", " I have to think their friends must be like \u201chey do you ever want to hang out with us?\u201d Dial that way back to once a month on varying nights.", "If Friday night dinners are good enough for Emily Gilmore, they're good enough for your mother in law. \nNTA", "So.. your mil is truly upset she cannot inconvenience more people for no reason just because? Like the principle of needing to feel like she \u201cwon\u201d ???? And your husband is just like \u201ccmon babe just deal with it plzzzzz\u201d lmao wtf NTA but your husband his mother sound exhausting and insufferable. Maybe just every other Saturday do a dinner and alternate parents. Your whole 8-parent-dinners-a-month schedule makes me stressed and hot and itchy lmao", "NTA. Tell MIL she can be grateful she gets Fridays or she can get no says. Tell her you tried Saturdays and it didn't work for you, so it's Fridays or nothing. Then mean it.  Honestly it sounds exhausting to constantly be running around to other people's homes in your limited free time. Are you and your husband averse to being home alone together?", "Have you considered rotating? One Saturday at your parents, then the next at the in-laws. Everyone gets that same amount of time, and no one is the favorite. Fridays can be your own family night. Just a thought.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut alternate saturdays between your and his parents, ahve the fridays for yourself to meet friends.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s nice you see both sets of parents regularly. It\u2019s common in my culture to spend lots of time with family and I wonder if you\u2019re an immigrant too.", "NTA. He's not considering your mom's feelings in suggesting they let her watch them eat while she fasts. Can't get around that part. If his mom wants dinners on Saturdays, then he can go to his mom's house on Saturdays, and you can have dinners with your family. MIL is being silly. Why can't both families get together on a Saturday every once in a while?", "NTA.  You tried because she wanted the night for cooking, etc. Maybe keep giving her Saturday and DO NOT help her, telling her she said she wanted Saturday night because it gave her more time to cook.   Your parents cannot do it another night.  I would move it to once a month for each", "NTA\n\nI would probably offer to do every other Saturday for each.", "NTA.. these weekle family gatherings with both sets sound exhausting.. and your inlaws are entitled..", "NTA \n\nYour hubby AGREES with you but is upset his mommy isn't getting her way... wow!", "Just spend your time separately. This MIL is exhausting.", "This is excessive. Do every other Saturday at 1 set of parents house. There's no reason for weekly dinners with both jeez when do you guys have time to unwind", "This won't work long-term, I would suggest cutting down initially as is mentioned in many posts, 8 family dinners a month is a lot.\n\n  To avoid any drama, maybe start with dividing up one Sat each, so that's meals 2 x month, then eventually move it to 1 x month on diff Saturdays.\n\nSo initially you are still having 4 family dinners a month (2 each), eventually 2- which honestly is plenty.", "ESH - What about Sunday?", "I'd stop going to her house at all.  She's jealous and petty.  No visits until she grows up.  NTA.", "Every other Saturday night at each parents house. This is so easy to solve.", "NTA - you have perfectly reasonable and valid reasons for when you see both sets of parents.  Your husband needs to grow a pair and just repeat those very reasonable and valid reasons and then offer to not come at all if it\u2019s inconvenient.", "NTA. You know what a MIL who really cares for family and have time to spend on Saturday would do? Yes, exactly, inviting your parents and sister. Your MIL is trying to measure her grip on you uncaring the religious thing (also: your mom starving while watching you eating? MILzilla dream I suppose!)", "NTA", "My reaction exactly- you\u2019re giving every non-work night to your families and they\u2019re complaining about it? Forget that- give them each one Saturday a month and take the rest of your time for YOU. Definitely NTA.", "I was just coming to say this!", "Finally. I mean, weekly dinners with my in-laws is my own personal hell but even I can see her point. \nIt sounds as if she still works and no one wants to work all day then cook and host people. \n\nEverything seems centred around OPs mum which isn\u2019t fair.\n\nI\u2019d say take turns on Saturdays.", "Alternate Saturdays.  Save your Fridays to BREATHE.", "I agree with all the others that this sounds like a great schedule. This also leaves some Saturdays open to spend with friends too!", ">we don\u2019t want these dinners to start feeling like an obligation\n\nThey already feel like an obligation to me, and I'm just reading about them, lol. I think the alternating Saturdays seems like a great idea.\n\nNTA", "Alternate once a month at each house.  Every year they get 6 dinners, and they can all be on Saturday.  Seeing your parents for dinner once a week is SO MUCH!", "You didn\u2019t mention any kids. If you have children in the future, I can tell you that this problem will most likely solve itself, as there is no way you will have the energy for this. That\u2019s a whole lotta relatives every week. You could also change it up, and let your husband go to his parents on his own sometimes. MIL sounds a bit of a pill.  NTA", "Exactly. We don't have an issue with seeing our parents weekly our issue is that it's becoming too complicated to make it all work therefore we may need to slow it down. I can see based on what other commenters are saying that maybe we're being taken for granted. I would slow down the dinners for that reason only", "Assuming OP and their husband work a typical 9-5 M-F, that leaves them with 2 nights to go and do something with friends/each other per week.  However both of those nights are occupied every single week with their parents.  Based on how OP wrote this, every Fri it's parents A and Saturday parents B.  This leaves minimal time for each other, friends, not sure if they have kids/family time.\n\nIt's not that OPs spends time with their parents. It's that they ONLY spend time with their parents.  It also sounds like Sunday is blocked partially as they have religious obligations", "I think that makes a lot of sense.  It\u2019s not about the time you currently have anymore. Now it\u2019s about the expectation and precedence this sets.\n\n Also if you have children this will all be too much but your families will still expect to have you this much.", "My husband comes from a big Catholic family. We lived near them for our first 9ish months of marriage.\n\nThere were monthly planned meals with his dad's entire extended family, monthly planned meals with just my \"nuclear\" in-laws, spontaneous meals with different family members almost every week, annual events with the entire extended family on either side...\n\nAnd not everyone in his extended family appreciated that I was from another state, where my family still lived. I received more than one guilt trip about not having a local wedding and about not committing every Christmas Eve to his extended family's celebration. \n\n(I asked my husband if he ever got guilt trips. I even described them in detail, in case he was oblivious to a guilt trip. No one in his family ever guilted *him* about our choices).", "We all lived in the same hometown so if we saw each other ONLY once a week that was a light week. I went to school with cousins, babysat other cousins multiple times a week , we had sports to attend and church every week and dinner after church\u2026 and that\u2019s not even getting into how even when I was well past the age I went to a babysitter myself I still went to my other grandparents\u2019 every week. My adult life is very different and that suits me fine but yeah. Family once a week is pretty conceivable to me."]}
