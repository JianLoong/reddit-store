I drive him to kindergarten every day that he's here and pick him up most of the days. 9 Months ago we welcomed our lovely daughter into this world (her birthday is 6 days after my stepsons) and it has been hard ever since but we make it work. Sometimes I get the feeling that my fianc\u00e9e puts his son first a lot of times because he feels like owes him for not being together with him all the time - my stepson spents 2 weeks at our house and 2 weeks at his mother's house.\n\nYesterday my fianc\u00e9 told me that he wants to celebrate both of their birthdays together when my stepson turns 5 and my daughter turns one because they are only 6 days apart and money is tight right now. He said that \"she doesn't even know what a birthday is anyways\" and that we should have a party on her birthday for the both of them. I told him that her first birthday is important to me and if he can only afford one party then he should make one for his son and I will make one for our daughter at my parents house because I don't want her to have to share her first birthday celebration. When I said that for me it's not only any birthday, it's the first birthday of my firstborn child, he got really upset and accused me of wanting to seperate his children.

I guess not? Your fianc\u00e9 seems well-meaning, but this doesn't sound like a good idea.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter doesn't need a full blown party, and your husband is right. She will not remember it. The party you want is for you and your parents. And there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nI point this out, because all you really need to celebrate her birthday is the right people over, a cake, and a camera. That is enough to mark the occasion without going into a huge budget.\n\nUltimately, the issue here is that for you this is a first, but it isn't your husbands, and instead of listening to you and honoring that, he's doubling down.", "NTA - My birthday is only 6 days away from my brother's birthday. I never once got my own birthday and once I was born neither did he. We both got to the point where we didn't even bother with birthdays because just why?\n\nYou don't have to have a party for each of them if you can't afford it but a separate family celebration is a must.

If ever there was a time to separate someone it's their birthday.  It's literally a day to celebrate just them.  Everyone deserves that.  Of course your daughter won't remember her first birthday but you will, and it's special to you.  NTA.  Everyone deserves to be celebrated independently on their birthday imo.", "NTA\n\nNowhere did you say you did not want to celebrate his birthday. You only said you wanted something small for your daughter as it's her FIRST birthday. You can make a small cake and take it to your parents or have a small group of people over to quietly sing happy birthday and take pictures. You don't need a bounce house, or character actors or anything fancy, she's ONE. \n\nI feel like he is deliberately 'misunderstanding' in order to not make much effort, or to put your daughter on the backburner.", "INFO\n\nIs money for the party a true concern? If you really can\u2019t afford a big party for both I do think this is a decent compromise. You can always do something special with your daughter like a family meal and birthday cake with just your family. \n\nI feel I need to know how legitimate the concern about money is because if finances are that tight I definitely don\u2019t recommend pushing your budget for something your daughter won\u2019t remember when there are so many cheap or free ways to make a birthday special. If you feel your finances are fine and this is an excuse then you both need to talk it out further and get to the root of why this bothers you so much.", "NAH- he\u2019s right, this birthday is not about her and she won\u2019t remember. I get wanting them seperate, but just acknowledge that it\u2019s for you", "ESH except the kids. A big first birthday party that requires a budget isn't for your child, it's for you. What you are really saying is that YOU don't want to share the spotlight with your stepson, and using your daughter to try to justify it. That makes you one of the assholes here. If budget only allows for one party, spend it on your stepson, who will likely be feeling kind of overshadowed and worried about a new baby anyway and would benefit from having the attention on him, and have a potluck or family gathering for your daughter's first birthday. She won't know the difference.

They are also different genders.   It wasn't fair on either of them sharing their birthday with the other.

You are both taking the situation to the extreme. Husband shouldn't consider this a test of your love, and you may be surprised at how little this matters five years from now. Your child is not going to remember, and she will still be loved at a joint party. You may both need to chill a bit, or it's going to be a looooong 18 years of blended family.", "You might think this is a problem now, wait until later.\n\nYou might think it's important to you to have a separate party for your daughter, think about how the 5 year old will feel.\n\nParties do not have to be expensive.  Especially for first birthdays.  Personally I'd keep them split for their own sakes.\n\nNAH, this is something you're going to have to communicate through.", "I'm curious how \"parties\" for a 1 and 5 year old could pose a budget issue. A birthday party for a toddler might consist of a handful of relatives coming over for pictures and a cupcake. Perhaps you could ask your guests to contribute something and you can buy a box of cupcakes or brownies from the grocery stores for \\~$12? These two parties shouldn't cost you more than $24?", "NTA.  \nCelebrating a child's first birthday is important. It's an important milestone in some cultures as well.\n\nYes, she will not remember this birthday. But later down the road, when she's older she could see the pictures and everything of the celebration. I will also point out that a child's first bday can be a focus on both parents and child, and there is nothing wrong with that. Parents need love too, especially that first year. \n\nNot to mention that OP missed these kinds of milestones with her stepson to begin with. In that sense, she is a new to being a mother in regards of the child being a baby, so she's gonna want to record every first of the kid. Standard parent behavior that had a baby, could be first or third, the excitement of firsts never fades.\n\nI'll also point out, sharing bdays sucks. There's a 5 year age difference here and it may set the precedence to continue to make these kids share a birthday in later years which is not gonna be fun. Like think 6 years into the future where you have a six year old and an eleven year old sharing a birthday party. That's a mess. She's proposing that each parent focusses on one child's party, nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.", "They both deserve to be celebrated on their own   Read posts on here of siblings that grew to resent each other. \n\nThey don\u2019t have to be huge things  but the kids do deserve to be celebrated for themselves", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nEveryone deserves to have their own birthday. Yes, your daughter's 1st birthday is a huge milestone, and yes, it's more for you than her at this time. That doesn't make it any less deserving to be recognized. \n\nYour stepson also deserves to have his own special day that's about him. He gets to have his friends and do activities that he's interested in.\n\nRecognizing each kid as an individual isn't separating them.", "You're NTa\n\nIt's not even about the 1yo. \n\nYour little man also deserves to be able to be celebrated by himself.

You let it start on her first birthday it\u2019s never gonna change.", "NTA - but don't pretend this is about your daughter, your daughter gives 0 shits.  Honestly I feel more bad for the son.  His life gets uprooted, now he has a little sister, and now he doesn't even get his own birthday?  That doesn't seem fair.", "NTA\n\nThis is something you should establish now and keep things the same going forward. I can guarantee that your stepson will not want to share the spotlight with his baby sister. They will also want to do different things for their birthdays. While this first birthday is more of a \"we made it a whole year!\" celebration for the parents, it will kind of set the tone. Why not establish that one will have their celebration on Saturday while the other will have it on Sunday? This stuff doesn't have to break the bank but you can still have fun and make each child feel special.   \nFor context, my husband and I have 4 kids between us, oldest two are my stepsons while the younger two are my biological children with my husband. Our Eldest's birthday is the 25th while our youngest's is on the 21st, just 4 days before.  Youngest just turned 1 this past year while oldest turned 12. We have established that we will always celebrate youngest's birthday on the Saturday and then oldest gets Sunday. They likely will never want to do the same thing for their birthday celebrations so it wouldn't be fair to either to force them to share the day. We also live far enough away from family that them coming on Saturday then spending the night makes sense and allows each child to feel special. This past year, we did a party at our house for the baby, complete with cupcakes, a bonfire, and the kids getting to stay up late with their cousins and grandparents, then we had breakfast together the next morning. After everyone headed home, we took the kids out to a trampoline park and getting ice cream as that is what oldest wanted to do for his special day.", "NTA The first birthday party is actually a \u201cwoo hoo, the baby lived\u201d, the 5 year old will want a oarty with friends and games.", "NTA. This is the problem; YOU ARE ALLOWED TO CELEBRATE YOUR FIRST YEAR AS A MOTHER!!! His son was able to celebrate his birthday by himself, but it\u2019s not fair to either child to share the birthday as they have two different, opposing, sides of family.", "Even if money is tight, how much of an extra expense is a cake (box mix is cheap) at your parents' house? Also my dad had to share his bday with his sister for years and even now he remembers hating it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nBoth children deserve their own party, and you are allowed to want a separate party for the first birthday of your first child. That doesnt mean you love your stepson any less. Your fiance may mean well, but he's doing the wrong thing by everyone.\n\nThat said, you need to have a serious conversation about your perception that he favours his son. That resentment is going to eat away at your relationship ship. Him feeling guilty about not being there all the time is fine, but if he is actually favouring him because of it, that is damaging to everyone. And if he's not, then you need to reasses why you think he is. That is the foundation of this argument, and it needs to be resolved before your marriage disintegrates.", "How is everyone glossing over the finance issues. OP even states in her comments that money is actually really tight. \n\nOtherwise I would say nta.", "NAH but i still think this is absurd. It\u2019s an infant\u2019s birthday.

His excuse for wanting the party together was financial, yet when you offered a perfectly acceptable alternative, he still refused.  To me, it does feel like the reason he wants to have the party as a joint party is to prioritise the 5 year old and show him he's important, because no doubt he'll also say when arranging the party when incorporating none of your daughters loves and interests that \"she won't even notice, she doesn't know what it is\" etc and so on.  I do agree that a one year old has no idea what's going on.  Unfortunately we were in low-down for my daughters 1st birthday so we didn't have any choice in the matter, but I felt absolutely horrid we couldn't do anything.", "Info: how does stepson feel about the idea of sharing his birthday/having it on his sister's birthday and not his?", "Soft ESH.\n\nI think there's plenty of room for compromise before y'all blow this out of proportion. It doesn't have to be the ultimatum you two have turned it into, of either separate parties or only one party.\n\nMoney being tight is valid, but you don't need much to celebrate a one-year-old's birthday, especially since she won't remember it in any capacity. She won't even know it's going on. This celebration would be more for you than her, which makes perfect sense since she's your first child. This is very special for you, but is it special enough that you have to throw an expensive shindig for a baby? Just have a small thing with people you care about and take lots of pictures for the lovely memories.", "NTA, it\u2019s her very first birthday!! That\u2019s a big one to celebrate!", "NAH\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, if money is tight, it\u2019s best to celebrate the five year olds birthday and just include the one year old. I understand that you\u2019re excited because this is your first child, but she\u2019s not gonna remember this. \n\nMy family doesn\u2019t throw birthday parties for anyone under the age of five. If anything they get a cupcake on their birthday and maybe a gift. But until children can appreciate parties and ask for them themselves, is kind of a waste of money.", "NTA.  You are correct that a first birthday is a big deal.  Your daughter may not know what a birthday is, but when she looks at the pictures later in life she will definitely know that her first birthday was not celebrated as something special.  \n\nI also really dislike it when events are combined just because they are close.  My husband and I have birthdays that are only 2 days apart and we always go out to dinner and celebrate the actual birthday person on their birthday.", "I do not think kids should share parties unless they are twins or unless they want to. Have 2 parties - spend less on each. The 5 your old should be prioritized just like the 1 year old. He will understand more that he is 'sharing' his party than she will so for him it is better not to have a shared party at this age. NTA and your husband needs to understand that. Just like if you are born on a holiday your birthday gets neglected. No need to neglect either child's special day.", "NTA.\n\nI turned 1 the same month my brother turned 6.

My brother is special and had special ed classes.  His friends attended the parties and I hated his friends and all their special needs.  My birthday was never special for ME nor were my friends invited because I was never certain it would go well for them.

I'm sure it's important for the grandparents too so just have a party with them like you planned and he can do whatever he wants, don't help him with any planning and scale back on pick ups and drop offs, that's not your responsibility at all, your focus should be on your baby.", "ESH I feel like this is a weird hill to die on.

Sometimes we would also do a sleepover or something closer to our actual days, but that was obviously when we were a bit older.

I know twins that hate their birthday cuz they have to share it", "I said in my post that it's about my own feelings as well. It's a special day for me because I have never been part of anyone's first birthday as I only my stepson when he was almost 2 years old.", "I'm sorry, English not my first language", "I didn't want to spend anything other than a homemade cake, but he said he wanted to invite people over. I said I would be happy if it could just be us and a few relatives to spend the day at my parents house", "My youngest sister said she was sad because she never had a birthday of her own until she was grown up. Even in her baby pictures the cake has both my sisters names on it.", "ugh my bday is the first week and it can be an advantage or disadvantage.", "My brothers have this scenario. 3 days apart and in December. My mother was militant that they each got their own party and no birthday-Christmas combo gifts were allowed. They only ever had one joint party and that was their own idea because combining the funds meant they could rent a bounce house. Even then, my mom scheduled the little kids earlier in the day and the big kids in the afternoon.\n\nI still hold our family tradition that Christmas doesn\u2019t start in our house until the day after the last birthday. I always remember going to get our tree that day as a great family bonding experience. Drives my husband crazy. He wants to decorate the tree after thanksgiving dinner. \n\nTLDR my mom is awesome and my brothers have always felt a deep sense of worth and love from her holding their individual birthdays separate.", "my sister is 5 days before mine and every birthday celebration was on her birthday because it was first. i could care less about my birthday because i never got cake, gifts, or even family over on my birthday, but my sister always had a birthday party and i have always been jealous even though it\u2019s not her fault. 17 was when my birthday was actual celebrated on my birthday and im currently 19. it sucked hard", "I understand what u r saying but u arent considering the nightmare its going to be explaining to them y gam gam was at girls party but couldnt b at sons party a week later. Not everyone has the time/schedule to fit back to back parties for one member of their family. Mine are 3 and 5 and we r constantly busy on weekends with kid stuff and other parties. Its simply your job to make them both feel special with the most reasonable solution. Finance has to be part of it. especially when that extra money could go towards other things the kids need", "FYI \u201cfianc\u00e9e\u201d refers to a woman and \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d refers to a man. If your partner is male, you\u2019re using the wrong term.", "I feel like him wanting a joint party is actually not treating the 5 year old well. The kid is already dealing with a lot of change having to go back and forth between parents homes and welcoming a new baby. He deserves to have his birthday be just about him, not shared with his new sibling.", "(Whispers) its French so no worry", "My sisters have birthdays about two weeks apart, and they had to share a party every year. They both hated it, and when my birthday came around they were resentful because I had my own personal one. It wasn't favoritism in my case, it was six months from theirs. It was the only time I got good attention from our mother.", "December 23 birthday here, and you are right about that. It doesn\u2019t bother me at all as an adult, but it was huge as a kid.", "Im exactly 4 years younger than my brother.\n\nI cant say how he felt the birthday sharing on the first 4-5 years of my life, but after that I can say that there was never any bad feelings from me nor my brother. It made perfect sense that the birthday parties were combined. Neither of us felt neglectes nor unappreciated as individuals. We were just happy to get presents, have our family join and both of our closest friends (whom also happened to be siblings Living 15 meters away from us)", "There\u2019s also ways of utilising birthday gear that make it cheaper, like keeping the happy birthday banners, candles, etc. One of my siblings turned 13 a couple of months before I turned 31. My mother actually send the candle (the 1 and 3 was separate so could make it 13 or 31) to Australia in my birthday card.", "[deleted]", "I combined my son and daughter\u2019s once. They\u2019re four years apart and it was a party at the community pool. The kids didn\u2019t mingle at all but I still felt guilty. Never did it again.", "It also depends on the kids and the circumstances. All three of mine have birthdays really close to each other. One year when they were pre teens  they came to me and said \u201cthey did the math\u201d. They all wanted a party at the ice skating rink and it was way less expensive per person to have one party for all three of them, than to have three separate parties. They were talking about three ice skating parties but I also did the math and a combined ice skating party was still cheaper than three no frills back yard parties. I did do it that year and your mom was right. It was chaos. Fun chaos, but still. I wouldn\u2019t have done it that way if they hadn\u2019t been the ones to bring it up.", "Two weeks seems like too much! Honestly -- my birthday is also the same week as a big holiday -- I wouldn't have blamed my mother for doing one. She was a single parent for most of our birthday years -- no money, no time. But she did it anyway.", "One of my siblings and I are literally one day after the other. As kids our parties were together and neither of us really liked it. Our parents did have us do separate activities but it was still the same party.", "Hey, that's my stepbrother's birthday!\n\nAnd yeah -- it's tough. My stepfather was ALSO a late-December baby. The force working against the birthday is profound. \n\n(I'm also born on Thanksgiving, but that rotates.)", "So two things... I know multiple people who share literal birthdays with siblings and I think it plays differently (not just twins, but people who were just born on the same day as their sibling ) because it's your ACTUAL birthday -- it's not convenience, it's not saving money, there's no room to interpret it as people not caring. It's just coincidence. \n\nSecondly -- I applaud your even-handed response, even as a child. I still think it's wiser to let each child have their day.", "LOL my mom always saved the candles too!", "But that's fine. I'm an elementary teacher. My school has a younger Kindergarten and an older K. Technically the younger is Transitional Kindergarten, but some of those kids go straight to first grade. We celebrated a little girl's 5th birthday today. She's really smart, this will probably be the only year of K she does.", "It was more detail than I felt necessary, but my mother's not crazy -- she tried it once, too. Just once, because it was bedlam. My brother and I didn't resent it -- but it was his 4th birthday and the first time he had any party at all. I was 6. I didn't care either. But she honestly ended up feeling like two parties was better all around. Even if it meant doing everything twice. \n\nI think that was definitely better when we got older.", "Yeah there was also a cousin whose birthday was between them and it was often shared with all three of them. Looking back I wish I'd at least taken the steps to give them their own cakes. Mom may have only wanted to cook one but I could have made a couple more.\n\nI hated my birthday for a totally different reason. It's right after Valentine's Day and I was always given cheap chocolate that was on sale and toys that were all pink and red and covered in hearts. I wanted books and art supplies, I hated all things girly as a kid!"]}
