My Fiancee is high risk and has an upcoming high risk consult. My fiancee has had two appointments so far. The first one with her OBGYN for the initial visit and blood work for confirmation and the second was an Ultrasound. I could not attend the first appointment due to being my first week back at work in 5 months after an injury. I have no PTO and new hospital, department and manager. So my future MIL went to the first appointment.  When speaking to my new manager, I was told \"no problem, please just give us as much heads up as possible for the appointments you need to make.\"  \n\nWhen my Fianc\u00e9e was updating me on how the appointment went and what to come says \"my mom will be coming with me to the high risk consult since I want you to come to the first Ultrasound.\" I stated \"I want to be at the high risk consult because this our journey of becoming parents and I have more to add with the doctor since I worked bedside critical care for a few years.\" I was told \"no, my mom really wanted to be at the first ultrasound too. You're getting to come to that[.](https://that.My) My mom was crying, making me feel guilty because her mom wasn't there when she got pregnant due to her passing and this is her first grandbaby.\" I got the day off anyway and my fianc\u00e9e says \"to give back the day since her mom is already coming. I need you at the next ultrasound plus you need to have PTO when the baby comes.\" My fianc\u00e9e will get ultrasounds every 2 weeks.   \n\n\nI told my fianc\u00e9e \" I feel very disrespected by this. I am a the father of the child and I want to be there. Your mom is trying to get her way like she constantly does.\" ( constantly fighting over holidays and sunday dinners. I come from divorced parents so this is especially hard.)  She told me \" I will fill you in. I already told my mom she could come and I don't want her to be upset.

You're engaged and about to become a father.  Yet a very big issue is looming in the background and clearly this has not been dealt with.  I'm talking about your comment that mom wins \"like she always does\".\n\nThis isn't a minor issue, because it has the potential to blow up your relationship.  Mom is overbearing, but that means it's well past the time when your fiancee needs to start putting you and your upcoming child first.  She's not doing that, and it's your job to point this out to her.\n\nIt's not surprising this has turned into ultimatums on her part, and pointless discussions on PTO.  This stuff is just symptoms of your inability or unwillingness to tackle the much bigger issue, which is that she needs a priority adjustment.", "Nah but please don't be this person:\n\n>I have more to add with the doctor since I worked bedside critical care for a few years.\n\nIt's great you have medical experience, but it's still HER medical care. Saying this sounds like you're trying to overrule her decisions.", "As a fellow nurse, I'm going with very soft YWBTA here, and this is why: You think you have more to contribute to the medical appointments than your future MIL. These appointments aren't about your experience as a nursing professional, or getting to the bottom of how your partner's pregnancy \"became\" high risk, etc. These appointments are about keeping your partner and the baby safe. In these appointments, your partner is the patient and you are the supportive partner. So leave the medical part at the door when you go to these appointments, or you will be overbearing. Also, once baby is born, you'll have to go back to work, and who will be there to support your partner with a newborn? Your MIL, so don't you want her to hear things straight from the doctor?", "INFO: What do you mean by \"I have more to add with the doctor since I worked bedside critical care for a few years.\"\n\nBecause to me, that sounds like you want to get your opinion in with the doctor, regardless of what your fiance wants or needs. You might have worked in critical care but unless you worked in obgyn your thoughts may not be needed nor wanted.", "NAH but when you make comments like this I can see why your fianc\u00e9e is wary of you being there:\n\n'I have more to add with the doctor since I worked bedside critical care for a few years'\n\nHer health, her doctor.\n\nIf attending this particular appointment means you can't make the ones your fianc\u00e9e wants you at, I'd say verging on Y T A.", "NAH. This is your child, too, but she is the patient. This is her medical appointment and her body. It is entirely her choice who she does or does not bring to any appointment. \n\nYour MIL is being a jerk, but you need to have a conversation about boundaries outside of this particular situation. Do not make this a power struggle or put your pregnant, high risk partner in a stressful situation. Going the \"cut your nose off to spite your face\" route will not be a good strategy.", "She may be more comfortable having another woman with her.", "YTA. The second paragraph of your post quite clearly states \u201cmy mom will be coming with me to the high risk appointment since I want you to come to the first ultrasound\u201d. She\u2019s told you what she wants. Listen to her.", "I guess I\u2019m going against the grain here but YTA\n\nPregnancy is a medical event. Your wife gets to decide who is involved in which steps of her medical care. Your medical experience isn\u2019t important because you are not her doctor. Sometimes people just want their moms for these big, scary things.", "YTA. This is your wife's medical appointment. Her name is on the chart, not the baby's. Sorry your MIL is a bossy lady who bullies your wife, but I don't think the solution is to also try to bully her.", "NTA.\n\nYou have every right to be there over your MIL. I feel for your partner as her mother is putting her in a tough spot but the MIL is massively overstepping boundaries, and that won\u2019t change until your fianc\u00e9e enforces them.", "YTA - it is a patient's decision who gets to be in the room. If you keep pushing it, she may not want you in the delivery room. I understand you have good intentions. But, pushing this issue will get worse. Let it go.", "YTA for pushing against her wishes. If you had stopped once voiced your concerns and feelings it would be a different story BUT you tried to force your way there and took time off to be there after she said NO. That makes me wonder if the problem is really your future MIL and I think there are missing details in all of this. You are being inappropriately aggressive after she said no. She has the ultimate say in who is at her appointments and if she doesn't want you at any of them you have to accept that. This does show a problem between the two of you relationship wise and maybe this is something you can move past BUT you trying to overrule her decisions is unacceptable. This is her medical journey not yours. You will be along for the ride but it is up to her to ask the questions or ask your help asking those questions. Talk to her and respect her.", "Dude, how many times does your wife need to say that her mom is more important to her than you are for you to finally get it?  NTA", "Soft YTA.  Based on your replies in the comments, you're so busy being another doctor in the room that you're not being her husband or support system.  You can ask medical questions, but not at the expense of providing her the emotional and spousal support she needs.\n\nSome perspective: You're a doctor so micromanaging her medical care is making you feel better about the high risk pregnancy.  Sounds like your wife is not a doctor so IT'S NOT HELPING HER feel better.  It's probably making her feel worse.  I know you're scared but she's scared too; it's her body that has to physically go through this.  Stop and ask her how you can best support her, not just yourself.", "NAH except MIL shouldn\u2019t be using her past trauma as a tactic to muscle in\u2026 I too have lost my mum before I had both of my kids, actually I had lost both of my parents but I wouldn\u2019t dream of guilt tripping my daughter into forcing her to take me to her appointment. That being said you should know working in a hospital yourself that the patient who is your fianc\u00e9e reserves the right to have whoever she wants to the appointment. \n\nI think you need to sit down and have a respectful chat about it with her again, but ultimately as she is the patient it is her decision.", "NTA. Your partner is not considering your feelings and it sounds like the future MIL doesn't know boundaries. This child is very much yours as it is your partner and guaranteed if anything happens (knock on wood), MIL would drop the ball and you'd have to pick up all of the pieces. You want to be a part of important appointments and MIL is getting in the way. Next thing you know she is in the room while the daughter gives birth, she names the baby, tells you what school the child will be attending, where to live, how the child should dress, etc. I would have a stern conversation with my partner. Let her know your thoughts and how boundaries will be implemented from here on out. You are a team of two, not three, and are being excluded and told what to do and not do. This isn't the old days, people aren't tolerating in-laws as much anymore. Your partner also disrespected you by silencing you, and then stated that \u201cthe decision is final\u201d. There are some things you need to work out before marriage. Just because you are having a child doesn't mean you have to rush into that level of commitment. Having a child is one thing, but marrying someone who doesn't consider you to be their equal and confidant is another.", "What are these comments? There is no child yet. The patient is OPs wife and she is the one who has a right to decide who she wants at her appointments. ESH except the actual patient. Half this post is irrelevant. If she doesn\u2019t want you there, it\u2019s her medical care and you\u2019re allowed to have your feelings about it. Her mother is allowed to have her feelings about it, and both of you get to back off and let her make her own medical decisions. You don\u2019t have a right to attend medical appointments for anyone but yourself and your children. There are currently no children. End of. I\u2019m sorry biology isn\u2019t fair. It\u2019s not fair women have to risk their lives to bring kids into the world. That\u2019s life.", "YTA\n\nPregnant high-risk person gets to decide who comes to their appointments. Full stop.", "I absolutely get that you want to be there, it is your child too, and you obviously love your fianc\u00e9e. But ultimately, this is medical care, and your fianc\u00e9e is the patient, and she needs to do what she feels is best for her care and her body. And you can be upset by that, but you shouldn't be adding to the stress of a woman with a high-risk pregnancy.", "NTA Yes mom to be is the patient but you are the father and engaged.  Her justification for her mom being there is not even for support but because her mom cried and is guilting her and mom's own mom wasn't there and her first grandchild...  Those should all be irrelevant.  You're the Dad, your first child trumps her being a grandmom.  If this is how you are treated now, what does this mean for you when the baby arrives?  Will mom guilt your fiance into decisions that exclude you?  The it's final comment is also very disrespectful. So yes she's the patient but this shows you something about what your life with this woman will be like.", "I know you're hurt,  but at the end of the day who attends the appointment - and who *doesn't* attend - is *entirely* up to your fiancee.\n\nIt really is up to her.    \n\nHaving said that,   you're NTA.    Not right now.    You're hurt,  and you're entitled to feel disrespected.      Just don't become TA,   y'know?", "INFO: why can\u2019t your wife have two support people at the high risk appt? Is it a hospital policy?", "Better put your foot down now or your mother in law will name baby,  decide where you live, be on all your vacations and rule your family.\n\nAsk \"fiancee\" if you two need to take a break.  Does she want to be a single mother?\n\nShe sounds awful.", "NTA but Tbh I\u2019d immediately go to marriage/couples counseling. This whole situation of me vs mil has the potential to blow up your entire relationship. Let her know that she\u2019s letting her mom take over every memory of this pregnancy from you even though you\u2019re the father. Make it clear that this needs to be a serious conversation and express how you feel secondary to her mother.", "NRA for wanting to be there, but you will be if you keep pushing it.\n\nThis is you *fiancee's* appt, and she is high risk. **She** needs to be calm, not you. If she wants her mom there, she should have her mom there. This isn't about you.", "NTA for wanting to be, but you need to sort out why your gf doesn\u2019t care if you are there. She is the patient and you don\u2019t have any \u201cright\u201d to be there. So if she\u2019s just caving to her mom, that\u2019s an issue to work on together. If, as may well be the case, she finds her mom\u2019s presence more reassuring, that\u2019s a whole different issue\u2014perhaps. Could be she can\u2019t cut the cord. Could be, instead, that she isn\u2019t confident about you. Have you done\u2014or failed to do\u2014things that might shake her confidence in you, for example? \n\nNo way to know what\u2019s going on without talking it out. I just know what it\u2019s like not to have confidence in a partner.", "NTA but welcome to a view of your future. You will always be second to your MIL, even (and maybe especially) when it comes to your own child. You have every right to be hurt and angry and your fianc\u00e9e doesn't even seem to care because she values her mother's feelings over yours.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird/pushy that you want to be there for the high risk appointment to discuss and ask questions because of your medical background. I\u2019m assuming you and fianc\u00e9e live together and spend every day together if not at work. It\u2019s odd that she is just giving in to someone telling a sob story instead of having the person she lives with and will spend the majority of her pregnancy with. The person that will drop everything to be there if there\u2019s an emergency happening during the pregnancy to be there.  I feel like it\u2019s important you both are aware of her high pregnancy information . Let\u2019s be real, there\u2019s no way she is going to be able to fill you in on every info she is given, questions and answers she gets. \nI have had 2 children and my husband has always been to every single appointment/ultrasound. I was even 19 during our first child living with my parents and I still never had my mom go with me.  We\u2019re 27 now, pregnant with our last and he still is the only one always because I want him there and he wants to be to.\n\n I\u2019m really sorry that this is happening. I would understand her mom going with her if you weren\u2019t available to go/if she was a single mom but you want to be involved and care for her health. I can only see more issues coming with MIL during this pregnancy. I think you guys should have a more serious sincere conversation that isn\u2019t arguing about this and let her know how important all of this is to you and that she is important to you, and your child. Don\u2019t give her any ultimatums, but she should definitely know that if she doesn\u2019t set boundaries with her mom, your relationship/potential marriage could suffer in the long run. In the end, you are the child\u2019s father and she is the grandmother, she shouldn\u2019t be guilt tripping or making demands. If your fianc\u00e9e, doesn\u2019t care about making you a priority above her mom for your new family, then I don\u2019t see how this can work out.", "YTA. This is not about her respecting you. It's about her getting medical care. She gets to invite whoever she wants, and your job is to support her. Take your damned ego right out of it!", "NTA - Of course you want to be there over your MIL, it\u2019s your baby not hers. However it is your wife\u2019s decision, not yours. Her body, her choice.", "This situation seems challenging, especially as you're trying to navigate both your fianc\u00e9e's needs and the dynamics within your families. It's completely understandable that you want to be present at the high-risk consult, considering your professional background and the significance of these appointments for both you and your fianc\u00e9e.\r  \n\r  \nThe feelings of being disregarded and disrespected are valid. It's important for both you and your fianc\u00e9e to communicate openly about your desires and concerns regarding these appointments. In a situation as crucial as this, both of you should be able to express your preferences and needs without feeling pressured or guilty. It might be beneficial to have a calm and open conversation with your fianc\u00e9e about the importance of your involvement in these appointments.\r  \n\r  \nPerhaps finding a compromise where both you and your fianc\u00e9e's mother can attend different significant appointments, ensuring that you're present at the high-risk consult while her mother attends another important ultrasound or appointment, could be a solution.\r  \n\r  \nFamily dynamics can be complex, but it's essential that both partners feel respected and included in these pivotal moments. The key is to communicate openly, understanding each other's needs and finding a solution that works for both of you.", "Can't more than one person come?", "NAH, except your MIL. At the end of the day, you might be the father, but it\u2019s her medical appointment so you actually don\u2019t have any rights to be there. \n\nThat being said, your MIL has no rights either. You could gently point out her behavior to your wife and remind her she doesn\u2019t deserve a guilt trip. Your wife is going to need to find her spine at some point or this is going to continue. But, at the end of the day, if your wife wants her mom there, she should have her mom.", "YTA\n\nI think I\u2019ve read a lot of this differently from the few other comments I\u2019ve read. \n\nIt sounds like your wife is concerned about your job and financial security. She seems to want you to save whatever PTO you have for when she will need it most - when the baby finally arrives. \n\nYou seem to be dismissing that and instead putting it as a you-vs-MIL issue. Your wife has already said that she wants you at the ultrasound - she wants YOU at the appointment she considers most important and worthy of you taking time off. \n\nWhile your new manager sounds awesome and accommodating, the fact remains that you don\u2019t have any paid time off. You\u2019ve just spent 5 months off work due to injury - how well are you and your wife doing financially right now?\n\nI think you need to communicate better with your wife. I think you have been very dismissive of her - she wants you to be at the (what she considers) important appointment, and to save your time off for when the baby arrives. She says nothing about actually wanting her mom there - in fact she told her mom flat out NO to the ultrasound appointment. \n\nYou\u2019ve instead decided to act like she is disrespecting you and are actually coming off as very controlling and competitive. \n\nSit with your wife and talk about your finances. This really doesn\u2019t seem to be about you-vs-MIL but you\u2019re being an asshole by acting like it is.", "I mean she doesnt have to invite you to any of her appointments. This actually isnt both of your \u201cjourney\u201ds into parenthood. These are her medical appointments and medical appointments are not spectator sports.", "I\u2019m surprised by all the N A H votes. I think OP\u2019s wife is 100% the asshole. Putting her mother\u2019s wants above her husband\u2019s? That\u2019s pretty fucked up.", "NTA and she can update her mother as much as she likes   but this is your baby and you should be there and grandma can have a phone call. And I would tell her that you are serious about this. If she persists than just go and tell the Dr that you are the father and it is important for you to know from them how things are progressing.", "YTA\n\nYou proposed and impregnated someone with whom you have major relationship issues. You aren't marriage ready. You need multiple years of getting over your personal issues before taking those major steps.", "NTA \nSeems like it\u2019s not your fianc\u00e9 who needs specifically her mother, but more like MIL solving her own trauma . You are right for highlighting how it makes you feel.", "NAH MIL got some issues!", "INFO: Why can\u2019t both you and MIL go to the consultation? It\u2019s not and either / or situation.", "NAH. If your fianc\u00e9 is high risk, as in her health is at risk, then yeah I can see her wanting her mom there!! I understand it\u2019s your baby too but at this stage it\u2019s more about the pregnant person. Your fianc\u00e9 wants her mom with her and that\u2019s okay!  \n\nJust my personal story here: my mom is one of my best friends and I always thought she\u2019d be the one I wanted during labour. Labour time came, both my mom and my husband were there, and I ended up asking my mom to leave for a bit and come back. It was such a bonding moment where I hadn\u2019t even realized until I was in the thick of it that it was my husband I wanted there and not my mom.  I didn\u2019t even invite my mom for the second birth. \n\nSo definitely need to talk things out with fianc\u00e9, but from an outsiders perspective your fianc\u00e9 is saying she wants her mom at her doctors appointment and you\u2019re saying that what you want is more important than what she wants.  When it comes to her body and her health.  So tread carefully!", "NAH but you have some serious thinking to do and I would show your fianc\u00e9 this thread.

You have a baby on the way, and if this is not nipped in the bud, it will get worse.", "NTA but welcome to the rest of your life, OP. Partners who are tied to Mommy's apron strings are toxic AF.", "Info: is it an option right now to suggest that, as her primary support person, you attend the first appointment and first ultrasound, then MIL can attend some of the others? It might be too late now, since you're already fighting about it, which cannot be good for baby or your fianc\u00e9, but if she has a lot of medical appointments coming up, that's a lot of chances for MIL to be there. The first appointment is pretty dull anyhow. And her obesity will be noted at lots of appointments, so going to the first one rather than MIL won't spare your fianc\u00e9 that. \n\nCounselling would be a good idea too, because you mention that you're the kind of person who cuts off their nose to spite their face and your fianc\u00e9 seems to either struggle with boundaries with her mom or is using that as an excuse and not telling you that she truly wants her mom to be there. \n\nThis is all stuff to get through before you add a screaming, weak necked, soft skulled sleep destroyer (I say this lovingly) to your home. Being a new parent amplifies existing cracks in the foundation of every relationship, it's such a hard time for many people. They say having a child is forever having your heart walking around outside of your body. You're so vulnerable and tired and scared and tired and broke and tired and also very tired. Strengthening the relationship and your boundaries is a good idea if at all possible. \n\nFinally, as someone who has a boundary stomping mother who would absolutely pull this shit with me, your fianc\u00e9 likely isn't prioritizing your MIL over you, she's choosing the path of least stress, trying to make everyone happy in order to not rock the boat. MIL sounds like an expert boat rocker.

Most importantly, this is your partner and your child and YOU as the spouse and father need to know and understand 100% of what is going on and be present to ask the questions your wife isn\u2019t going to think of in the moment and advocate for her when she is too overwhelmed to advocate for herself. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you can persuade your wife to allow you to come to the appointment, but it is possible she can have you on the phone to listen and ask questions?
