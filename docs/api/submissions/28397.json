The kid might not have known but there\u2019s no excuse for the mom.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you said, your service dog is medical equipment, and if someone were to pet him, that could potentially distract him from doing what you need him to do.  Since the mom kept pushing, she deserved the response you gave her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a wheelchair user, and it bugs me to no end when people touch my chair.  Even a slight bump can cause shockwaves of pain through my body.  Besides that, I'd rather not have people touching my stuff without permission.", "That was honestly so quick witted, really put in perspective how it feels to treat your lifesaving equipment as a toy.

Nta.", "NTA\n\nSorry about the situation you found yourself in, but my god that comeback had me chuckling like a loony!

That\u2019s a fantastic response.", "I saw the title and thought that was weird, but when I read the first sentence, I was like, \"Ohhh I see where this is going!\" Yeah, NTA", "I would have loved to witness this interaction", "NTA. At all. The parents need to teach the kid to never, ever approach a strange dog, much less one wearing a vest. He'll get bitten/mauled. God forbid he appears threatening or aggressive to a GSD's or Malinois' person...", "NTA, you clearly told them they couldn\u2019t and they still acted entitled to what they wanted", "NTA and congratulations on that amazing comeback on her.", "Nta.  It was harsh yes, but the kid needed to learn and the mother proved he wouldn't learn from her.\n\nOn a complete side note, there's several service dogs (and a bunch of obviously fake ones sadly) in my area and I have the horrible luck to be around when accidents and weird situations happen.  Obviously every situation is different, but I'm curious on your opinion if bystanders should offer help when there's no visible injuries or just leave you be.  When were close enough to notice something anyway.", "NTA\nWell done you!!  Hopefully this kid will remember how much of an AH his mother was to you and he will learn you can't have everything you want just because you have a disability.", "Definitely NTA.", "People push into my wheelchair, not realising that every shove goes through my body & causes pain. I\u2019d love to push someone into a barrier so they know how it feels. The day is young.", "I'm a service dog handler and I'm on the fence about this. On one hand, I 10000% empathize with being asked if someone can pet my dog while he's working and people not taking \"no\" as a complete sentence. If I'm shopping, its because I have no alternatives to doing so, and I want to get out of there as fast as possible. It is not possible to do so when I'm being forced into conversation and stopped by people wanting to pet Odin. On the other hand, I understand that a child may not understand the... how do I say this.. Basically, they may not understand that it isn't normal for people to touch their mobility aide because a lot of kids have their parents or family members or even friends and teachers who touch their wheelchair or guide their wheelchair or whatever their wheelchair and they haven't yet learned that autonomy. They may feel like \"well, everyone in my life does things with me and my wheelchair that I don't always consent to, so why can't I touch your aid?\" \n\nThe mom is TA, regardless. If I'm not in a rush or if I'm doing something like waiting for the cashier to scan my groceries, I usually let people pet Odin if they ask first. I have seizures and Odin has never missed an alert because he's been getting pet and if your dog is well trained, then they also shouldn't miss an alert if they're being pet either. I'm not saying that you need to let anyone pet them all of the time or even most times, but I don't personally agree with people who don't let people pet their service dogs ever.", "YTA\n\nI find it hard to believe that a mother of a disabled 12 yr old doesn't understand that your dog is your medical equipment, but if that's true, there was no need for you to snap. You could have easily told the kid that the way he needs his wheelchair, you need your dog, and he wouldn't want anyone to touch his wheelchair, and you don't want anyone touching your dog. You could say that you know he looks cute, but that your dog is working at the moment and can't have any distractions like strangers petting him. All of that would have taken less time than what you ended up doing. You would have likely saved time, avoided lashing out, and taught someone a valuable lesson.", "I can understand it's annoying to have people pet your service dog, but surely an exception can be made for a child in a wheelchair.", "Imagine yelling infront of a kid", "ETA (except the kid) you likely have a similar condition to me that causes me to collapse all the time so I get it, you shouldn't touch service dogs. But it was a kid, you didn't need to swear at him. He could have had a broken leg but he could have had complex disabilities & a learning disability- you don't know. If anything, the mom was in the wrong but you still didn't need to swear at people to resolve the situation. Your delivery makes you an AH.\n\n*Interesting downvotes given my position as another disabled person in the same situation as OP. I get asked annoying and infuriating questions all the time, sometimes people try to touch me and my dog. Difference is I don't snap at curious disabled children. OP could have delivered their point better & that's the opinion I'm sticking to.", "YTA. For calling your dog medical equipment...", "NTA\n\nBut you are my hero.", "NTA - you have a big sign on the dog ! People aught to be able to read ! Mom even asking is very entitled! \ngood comeback with the wheelchair. Some people are so dense.", "you can see where her son gets it. NTA", "NTA honestly this is the world we live in now.

Sadly, some just don't learn.", "That sounds so odd to me I'll be honest.", "No one should be touching/ bumping your chair in the same way no one should be touching OP\u2019s service dog\u2026", "wow you live a boring life...", "To be fair, stories like this are made up to create interactions so that the accounts can be sold. These days, it's no longer about interwebz cred most of the time...\n\nThis is something that might have happened - but I suspect you're right...", "The kid is 12 old enough to already know how service dogs works. She already explained when she said \u201cno\u201d the first time indeed she said \u201cno, he is working, I do not want my medical equipment to be distracted\u201d", "With a mother like his, he probably doesn\u2019t need to imagine.", "Imagine being so precious you think no one should yell ever if there's a kid there lol.", "She didn't swear at the kid. \n\nShe said \"yes, that's the fucking point\" to the mom, and frankly? Kids hear swearing. Also? The one single swear word was used to emphasise a viewpoint not as a derogatory insult.\n\nThe mom on the other hand swore directly at OP, using her expletive as an insult. She was fine with using crude language around her kid, so I don't know why you are holding OP to a higher standard.", "Me, they didn't listen.  Sometimes a swear word can shock people into listening.", "Service dogs are medical equipment though? Like, legally recognized as such.", "Yes he does need to learn that, but he asked and didn't just pet it, so he is half way even if he's insistent.  The service dog should be trained not to attack let alone maul someone though.  Theres nothing to indicate that ops dog is poorly trained.", "It is absolutely not NAH, because the mother was rude beyond belief in being so pushy and calling OP an asshole.\n\nAlso? OP was not rude to the kid. \"You let me pet your wheelchair and I'll let you pet my dog\" is not rude. It's making a point.", ".", "There was a U.K. TV show with a girl in a wheelchair. The staff went to the pub & someone actually moved her chair backwards so they could get in, then bumped it back again. When people said \u201cthat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d, the actress said that had happened to her. People in wheelchairs are seen like inanimate objects sometimes - like OP\u2019s dog, but his inanimate object is fluffy!", "Nonsense. Most adults don't know how service dogs work. And if she used those words, at 12 he likely wouldn't have understood her. You can pretend that the average 12 yr old is more advanced than that, but in general, you would be wrong.", "But again, maybe the child has mental disabilities or issues with impulse control. 12 is still young and still considered a child. I won\u2019t ever agree to yelling at a child even if they ask the same question 5 different times in 5 different ways. Have at it with the mom if that makes you feel better but never with the child.", "There's no need to use any kind of strong language. I'm holding OP to the same standards as myself. As I said, I also am disabled and collapse all the time, use a mobility aid and a dog so am well equipped to give an opinion on this topic. It pisses me off royally when people ask me stupid questions. Do I use foul language though? no. Would I snap at a TWELVE YEAR OLD for asking a stupid question? No. The mum was also wrong in this situation but I can't see the part where she swore at anyone..?", "What OP said was actually a very good learning point, they pointed out that the dog is as much an aid as a wheelchair. All the previous times the kid asked they hadn't been made aware of this. It would likely have been enough of a point on its own to get the kid to understand. It's the delivery though makes OP an AH imo.", "And she did snap at the mother, when she said that touching medical equipment is strange.", "Asshole may be a \"mild\" expletive that many people don't think about much, but it's in the exact same class of \"bodily-function-referencing crude language\" that \"fuck\" is. So is \"pisses me off\", btw. \n\nAnd OP did not snap at the twelve year old. She answered him politely, and he left, apparently understanding her refusal. \n\nHis mom then barreled in and harassed OP, refusing to take no for an answer and calling OP an asshole for her refusal.", "But OP didn't snap at a 12 year old, they snapped at a mom who badgered them to let their kid pet the dog after repeatedly being politely told no.", "She gave him 2 nos, you'd really stand there trying for a third no?  Id be annoyed enough to swear two at that point.", "Op wrote in the text that they snapped. \n\nI said the mom was an AH too. I said everyone except the little boy is, so I'm not disagreeing with you there.", "If you have a short temper then you do you, I guess. I agree that If it was an adult I'd probably lose it but with children, especially ones with obvious disabilities, I tend to exert patience.", "You originally claimed she swore at the kid. \n\nYes, she snapped. That doesn't mean that she was rude, only that she became annoyed by the harassment and let that emotion show. It also doesn't mean that she verbally snapped *at* the kid. OP had already politely explained the situation to him twice, and when pushed to the point of annoyance her response to the kid was direct and to the point - \"you let me pet your wheelchair and I'll let you pet my dog\" - but not rude or crude, and only as offensive as their continuing harassment already was for her. \n\nThe following swearing was in a sentence directed solely towards the mom harassing and swearing at her.\n\nAnd frankly, the little boy is an AH as well, because on re-reading, his mom isn't the only person that harassed OP. It shouldn't have taken multiple refusals from OP to get him to drop the subject and leave. Especially given that his leaving was immediately followed by his mom's appearance.", "He's got a physical disability, but given he is able to ask to pet the dog, argue with her and there's no other indication mentioned of a mental disability id treat him like any other teenager.  The shock factor can still work to make kids who won't listen pay attention.  Also, my patience probably would run out after repeated nos, yeah.", "Op doesn't know what disability the child has, just that they are in a wheelchair. I said above that there was no way of OP knowing, they could just have had a broken leg but they could also have had a complex disability. As well as being disabled I work in a role supporting disabled people and you often find comorbidities. If I didn't know for sure I would always proceed with that in mind. \n\nI vehemently disagree that shocking a kid into 'learning' is a good idea but this is an opinion sub so I respect your opinion."]}
