Obviously every situation is different, but I'm curious on your opinion if bystanders should offer help when there's no visible injuries or just leave you be.

I\u2019d love to push someone into a barrier so they know how it feels. The day is young.", "I'm a service dog handler and I'm on the fence about this. On one hand, I 10000% empathize with being asked if someone can pet my dog while he's working and people not taking \"no\" as a complete sentence. If I'm shopping, its because I have no alternatives to doing so, and I want to get out of there as fast as possible. It is not possible to do so when I'm being forced into conversation and stopped by people wanting to pet Odin. On the other hand, I understand that a child may not understand the... how do I say this.. Basically, they may not understand that it isn't normal for people to touch their mobility aide because a lot of kids have their parents or family members or even friends and teachers who touch their wheelchair or guide their wheelchair or whatever their wheelchair and they haven't yet learned that autonomy. They may feel like \"well, everyone in my life does things with me and my wheelchair that I don't always consent to, so why can't I touch your aid?\" \n\nThe mom is TA, regardless. If I'm not in a rush or if I'm doing something like waiting for the cashier to scan my groceries, I usually let people pet Odin if they ask first. I have seizures and Odin has never missed an alert because he's been getting pet and if your dog is well trained, then they also shouldn't miss an alert if they're being pet either. I'm not saying that you need to let anyone pet them all of the time or even most times, but I don't personally agree with people who don't let people pet their service dogs ever.", "YTA\n\nI find it hard to believe that a mother of a disabled 12 yr old doesn't understand that your dog is your medical equipment, but if that's true, there was no need for you to snap. You could have easily told the kid that the way he needs his wheelchair, you need your dog, and he wouldn't want anyone to touch his wheelchair, and you don't want anyone touching your dog. You could say that you know he looks cute, but that your dog is working at the moment and can't have any distractions like strangers petting him. All of that would have taken less time than what you ended up doing. You would have likely saved time, avoided lashing out, and taught someone a valuable lesson.", "I can understand it's annoying to have people pet your service dog, but surely an exception can be made for a child in a wheelchair.", "Imagine yelling infront of a kid", "ETA (except the kid) you likely have a similar condition to me that causes me to collapse all the time so I get it, you shouldn't touch service dogs. But it was a kid, you didn't need to swear at him. He could have had a broken leg but he could have had complex disabilities & a learning disability- you don't know. If anything, the mom was in the wrong but you still didn't need to swear at people to resolve the situation. Your delivery makes you an AH.\n\n*Interesting downvotes given my position as another disabled person in the same situation as OP. I get asked annoying and infuriating questions all the time, sometimes people try to touch me and my dog. Difference is I don't snap at curious disabled children.

Kids hear swearing. Also? The one single swear word was used to emphasise a viewpoint not as a derogatory insult.\n\nThe mom on the other hand swore directly at OP, using her expletive as an insult. She was fine with using crude language around her kid, so I don't know why you are holding OP to a higher standard.", "Me, they didn't listen.  Sometimes a swear word can shock people into listening.", "Service dogs are medical equipment though? Like, legally recognized as such.", "Yes he does need to learn that, but he asked and didn't just pet it, so he is half way even if he's insistent.  The service dog should be trained not to attack let alone maul someone though.  Theres nothing to indicate that ops dog is poorly trained.", "It is absolutely not NAH, because the mother was rude beyond belief in being so pushy and calling OP an asshole.\n\nAlso?

And if she used those words, at 12 he likely wouldn't have understood her. You can pretend that the average 12 yr old is more advanced than that, but in general, you would be wrong.", "But again, maybe the child has mental disabilities or issues with impulse control. 12 is still young and still considered a child. I won\u2019t ever agree to yelling at a child even if they ask the same question 5 different times in 5 different ways. Have at it with the mom if that makes you feel better but never with the child.", "There's no need to use any kind of strong language. I'm holding OP to the same standards as myself. As I said, I also am disabled and collapse all the time, use a mobility aid and a dog so am well equipped to give an opinion on this topic. It pisses me off royally when people ask me stupid questions. Do I use foul language though? no. Would I snap at a TWELVE YEAR OLD for asking a stupid question? No. The mum was also wrong in this situation but I can't see the part where she swore at anyone..?", "What OP said was actually a very good learning point, they pointed out that the dog is as much an aid as a wheelchair. All the previous times the kid asked they hadn't been made aware of this. It would likely have been enough of a point on its own to get the kid to understand. It's the delivery though makes OP an AH imo.", "And she did snap at the mother, when she said that touching medical equipment is strange.", "Asshole may be a \"mild\" expletive that many people don't think about much, but it's in the exact same class of \"bodily-function-referencing crude language\" that \"fuck\" is. So is \"pisses me off\", btw. \n\nAnd OP did not snap at the twelve year old. She answered him politely, and he left, apparently understanding her refusal. \n\nHis mom then barreled in and harassed OP, refusing to take no for an answer and calling OP an asshole for her refusal.", "But OP didn't snap at a 12 year old, they snapped at a mom who badgered them to let their kid pet the dog after repeatedly being politely told no.", "She gave him 2 nos, you'd really stand there trying for a third no?  Id be annoyed enough to swear two at that point.", "Op wrote in the text that they snapped. \n\nI said the mom was an AH too. I said everyone except the little boy is, so I'm not disagreeing with you there.", "If you have a short temper then you do you, I guess. I agree that If it was an adult I'd probably lose it but with children, especially ones with obvious disabilities, I tend to exert patience.", "You originally claimed she swore at the kid. \n\nYes, she snapped. That doesn't mean that she was rude, only that she became annoyed by the harassment and let that emotion show. It also doesn't mean that she verbally snapped *at* the kid. OP had already politely explained the situation to him twice, and when pushed to the point of annoyance her response to the kid was direct and to the point - \"you let me pet your wheelchair and I'll let you pet my dog\" - but not rude or crude, and only as offensive as their continuing harassment already was for her. \n\nThe following swearing was in a sentence directed solely towards the mom harassing and swearing at her.\n\nAnd frankly, the little boy is an AH as well, because on re-reading, his mom isn't the only person that harassed OP. It shouldn't have taken multiple refusals from OP to get him to drop the subject and leave. Especially given that his leaving was immediately followed by his mom's appearance.", "He's got a physical disability, but given he is able to ask to pet the dog, argue with her and there's no other indication mentioned of a mental disability id treat him like any other teenager.  The shock factor can still work to make kids who won't listen pay attention.  Also, my patience probably would run out after repeated nos, yeah.", "Op doesn't know what disability the child has, just that they are in a wheelchair. I said above that there was no way of OP knowing, they could just have had a broken leg but they could also have had a complex disability. As well as being disabled I work in a role supporting disabled people and you often find comorbidities. If I didn't know for sure I would always proceed with that in mind. \n\nI vehemently disagree that shocking a kid into 'learning' is a good idea but this is an opinion sub so I respect your opinion.", "Honestly, even if the dog wasn't a medical aid, you should never insist on patting a dog when the owner says no!", "If the answer is no to any question that starts with something like \u201cCan I touch your\u2026\u201d, the asker should not try to change the person\u2019s mind\u2026.", "I don't understand why people have such a problem understanding this. I was literally taught this in public school. In first grade, they had a blind guy come talk to us, and one of the things the guy and our teachers stressed is that you never pet a working dog. You don't even ask. We understood it just fine.\n\nI was in a yoga class not too long ago that had a blind guy with a dog (the dog just chilled in the back), and another student asked if she could pet the dog. The owner hesitated, like he didn't want to be mean, but the instructor jumped right in and said that you don't pet service dogs.", "NTA - seems everyone has a story with service dogs, so here's mine. MBA classes and one of the students has a service dog with vest. Rest of class was very good about respecting the vest. One class near the end of term, she rolls in and doggo is not wearing his vest. She tells us to pet away. Doggo and the class spent about 10 minutes laughing with lots of pets. Doggo spinning in circles looking for next pet delivery person was awesome. She took him out to potty/calm down, vest went back on and we all got to work. It was a nice treat for the class and I think a way for her to thank us collectively for recognizing the vest as the not a pet sign that it is.", "I don't understand why people are even asking when they won't accept no as an answer.\nMy dog is a pet, not a service dog, but while he is generally all sweet and cuddly he is also anxious and even more so as he got old and doesn't hear or see well. So while adults petting him is perfectly safe, loud and fast moving kids are to be avoided. Which I am doing. Except these kids often go out of their way to come and ask to pet the dog and then start petting him despite the hard no and explanation being given. And parents are typically enablers of such behavior.\nI swear I'm gonna kick one of these kids in the ass one day.\nNTA OP, and tell your dog I said Hi!", "Not the AH. Mother was being entitled and teaching her kid it was okay. No means no. No matter what the circumstances are. She got put in her place and you did it by asking the same question they were. You tried to show them the connection and they ignored it. It doesn't matter if he was disabled or not. No means no. I'm proud of you tbh. She needs to teach her child a bit more.", "NTA No one should be touching your dog when you say no, even if it were not a service dog. Anyone who touches your things without permission but even more so when they've been told no is an AH. It doesn't matter what the thing is, legos, clothes, toys, dogs, pregnant bellies, hair, etc. people are AH for touching without permission, period.", "NTA.  That is a genius way to respond.\n\nBut also, how does a dog snap you out of fainting?  I'm genuinely curious how that works.", "NTA\n\nWas going to say yes based on title but NTA", "NTA, people REALLY need to learn to respect service dogs and leave them alone.", "NTA. What a brilliant comeback!", "NTA\n\nThe dog is even wearing a sign. I'd ask them if they can read and then tell them to read the sign", "Yeah fuck that kid, he's not a little toddler no more he can't just go arouns touching people's LABELED medical equipment. That's like asking an old guy to *pretty pleeeaseee* unplug their life support", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right, THEY were the AHs for not respecting your NO.", "NTA, you made a perfectly valid point.", "NTA\n\nI don't think it's wrong to ask you if he can pet the dg. But you said no. At that point you don't ask again.\n\nThe mother then escalated it. Your response was reasonable in that context.", "NTA, side note I read it at first at farting episodes\u2026 so yeh that happened", "Nta, she didn\u2019t like how the tables were turned.", "This was such an excellent response.  NTA.", "Nta. She was.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, why so they bother asking if it's OK if they aren't prepared for a no answer? Whatever the question is, no means no.\n\nAlso insisting on petting someone's dog after being told no is a good way to get bitten by a dog. \n\n Their behavior was very rude and presumptuous. They got what they deserved.", "You weren't rude out of the gate.  They kept insisting", "NTA. As you said he is medical equipment. When people don\u2019t want to listen, sometimes rudeness becomes a necessity. Also, even apart from all this - you don\u2019t touch people\u2019s stuff or animals without their permission. Even if he was just a regular pet, nobody has the right to touch him. I don\u2019t understand the audacity of these people.", "NTA.", "Nta. His disability doesn\u2019t cancel out yours. Both of them were being disrespectful", "NTA", "Nta, but you might be a hero. Medical equipment is medical equipment, and even if yours is far cuter than most, when doggo is on duty, doggo is off limits.", "NTA\n\nI am a huge, huge animal person, to the point where even though I always ask if I can say hello to any dog I meet in public, over half the time the dog has made the question moot by time I\u2019m halfway through asking it because the dog has already decided that regardless of their owner\u2019s feelings they\u2019re going to get all up in my business. But the key is that unless I\u2019m just minding my business and a dog comes out of nowhere and attaches itself to me (which has happened, tbh) I *always ask*. It\u2019s not just a courtesy for service dogs, it\u2019s thing you have to do for all dogs. Sometimes dogs have sensitivities or triggers or medical issues themselves. Sometimes they need training on how to approach people. Sometimes the owner is just in a rush. Sometimes owners of service dogs are perfectly fine with or even welcome you petting their service dog because the dog is on a break in certain scenarios, but sometimes they\u2019re not, which is again why you *ask* if the dog is working and then you respect the answer. You don\u2019t even need to bring the fact that your dog is a service dog into it, though that does add an extra layer of irony. If someone says not to pet their dog, DO NOT PET THEIR DOG. This is for the safety of you, the dog, and the person asking. Period. If you need to keep pushing with the stupid question of why, you\u2019re gonna get the stupid answer.", "NTA. I get the 12 YO maybe asking once or twice. It took me a while to understand as a kid that you no touchy working Doggy, but I was still always taught to ask. But for shame on his mother. An adult should understand perfectly well that it his a working dog, so you cannot pet while he is working. She should explain that to her boy. And your comeback was the perfect point to get across that he is medical equipment at the moment, not just some fluffy good Boi.", "NTA. That was a fantastic comeback! I have to applaud you for your quick wit. \n\nI don\u2019t get the asking - the dog had the vest on them and it was very plain. But, even when the kid asked and you said no, for the kid to insist was just rude. Then to get Mom involved - basically try to intimidate you into giving in. Both of them deserved everything you gave them and more. \n\nEven if it weren\u2019t a service dog - people are not entitled to pet other people\u2019s animals. This is even more for working animals. People need to learn to keep their hands to themselves.", "NTA and was actually a great teaching point For both children and adults. While adults should have enough sense I've honestly seen them be worse about this than children.  You broke it down in a way that I believe a child could recognize the significance.  And even if this mom wasn't getting it maybe her son did.", "If you wouldn't try to distract a doctor treating a patient, you shouldn't distract a service dog while they're working either. You shouldn't really be disturbing or touching anyone while they're working lol, dogs included. Idk what it is about people that as soon as they see a dog, baby, or even pregnant belly, they lose all wits about them and wanna put their grubby hands all over. My husband and I literally just adopted two puppies, and they were too young to be left home alone when we needed some supplies, so we brought them to the pet store and IMMEDIATELY people come up and just touch them without permission. They see the dog before they even see us and then always make very uncomfortable conversation about \"if you don't want them I'll take them!\" I'm a very introverted autistic person so when thinking about whether or not to have dogs, I really did consider that we'd get extra attention and I was just hoping it wouldn't be bad. I hate it. I can't imagine how it feels having a dog that is meant to do life-saving medical work and people always want to distract it or grab at it. NTA.", "NTA - a perfectly reasonable response after being nice and polite the first few times. \n\nAnd yay! You got a husky to work! lol.. mine just eats up the house and snores all night.", "Can I pet your wheelchair lol", "Not the asshole. \n\nYour dog was working, and assists you during your daily activities and is there to make sure you are safe. Even if your dog wasn't working, they should still respect and obey your answer when you tell them they can't pet your dog.", "NTA. You didn't snap right away.

But speaking from the experience of having disabled friends and family members and having been temporarily disabled myself due to injury, it\u2019s sadly not all that implausible it\u2019s true, either. There\u2019s such a deeply engrained disgust and fear of disability that it\u2019s not at all uncommon for even people with disabilities themselves or who are like, professionals whose job it is to help people with disabilities, will when confronted with a disability promptly forget every scrap of common sense or everything they\u2019ve ever been taught about how interacting with human beings is supposed to work. It was always amazing to me when I first started having friends and family members who needed me to push them places in wheelchairs how many people don\u2019t understand basic mechanics like how to hold open doors (most people will stand inside the door instead of behind it, blocking the wheelchair) or that even one \u201clittle\u201d step is too big a step for a wheelchair.

(Spoiler: I got better but never got the software.) I only personally lived with it for nine months, but even in that time I developed dozens of \u201cspontaneous\u201d seeming comebacks that were actually just canned responses I had to give over and over and over. When it\u2019s a thing you\u2019ve been dealing with for years or even your entire life, your repertoire gets even bigger.

When working, that's basically what it is.", "The real asshole here is you.", "Because, by definition, it is.", "According to the original post, it\u2019s a medical alert dog. It can be dangerous to let someone pet a medical alert dog, because that distracts the dog, meaning it may not notice critical warnings pointing to the thing the dog is trained to alert the owner for. For example, many medical alert dogs are trained to alert their owner if they\u2019re about to have a seizure or lose consciousness. If you are someone who has a dog trained for this sort of task, and a stranger starts petting the dog, the dog will get distracted, and may not notice signs of the owner about to have a seizure or lose consciousness. While the dog is distracted, the owner could very well pass out or have a seizure without having enough of a warning to prepare for that (by laying down, for example) and could end up hitting their head, causing them to need medical treatment or even killing them. \n\nWhen disabled people say not to pet service dogs, it isn\u2019t because they\u2019re being mean. Many disabled people rely on their service animals to keep them alive, and if someone distracts their service dog by petting it, they could very easily get the dog\u2019s owner injured or killed. \n\nAnd even if the dog isn\u2019t a medical alert dog, you still shouldn\u2019t distract it. (Blind people rely on seeing eye dogs for their mobility, just as someone with a cane or a wheelchair relies on their cane/chair for mobility. Obviously it would be pretty messed up to move someone out of their wheelchair so you can sit there or take someone\u2019s cane or crutches out of their hands for you to play with them. So why would it be ok to prevent a blind person from being able to use THEIR mobility aid? Because the mobility aid in question is cute?)\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying this all as an attack against you, and I\u2019m not trying to insult you for not knowing. However, it\u2019s important to remember that disability doesn\u2019t always look like a person in a wheelchair. Sometimes disability is a person with a white cane, hearing aids, a cochlear implant, a service dog, work/school accommodations, an insulin pump, an AAC device, or any number of other aids. Regardless of what aids a disabled person may use, you should never mess with their disability aids without their consent.
