They go to a private Jewish kindergarten where it\u2019s very customary to invite the whole class to birthday parties, it might even be a school rule but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to take this to the school.\n\nJude and Jonah are very well mannered and reserved, obviously I\u2019m biased but they\u2019ve always gotten along with all of their peers and have never gotten into any drama. Jude is definitely a slow reader and we\u2019ve gotten him a tutor but it\u2019s still been very hard for him.\n\nAt our synagogue the bathroom signs just say men and women with no little picture and they are single bathrooms. 2 weekends ago Jude walked into the women\u2019s by accident and I guess the door wasn\u2019t locked correctly because he walked in on this women named Jess who is the mother of a little girl in his class. He says he just saw her on the toilet and ran out, closed the door and said sorry. \n\nJude immediately came up to me and told me and he was very embarrassed. I told him it wasn\u2019t a big deal and he should just remember to knock next time and the longer word says women. He said he will and that he thought it would be a stalled bathroom like most public bathrooms and that\u2019s fair so I left it there.\n\nJess came up to talk to me after and told me like he needed to be punished, she said it was extremely inappropriate. I assured her he didn\u2019t know and wouldn\u2019t do it again but she said there\u2019s \u201cno way he can\u2019t read men and women\u201d and that her daughter can and told me I had to nip this behavior in the bud. I often feel talked down to because of my age by other parents at the school so I just said I would take care of it and left it there.\n\nOn Friday her daughter was handing out birthday invites and gave one to Jonah, not Jude. They both asked her why and she said her mom said not to give him one and wouldn\u2019t tell her why. Jude cried the whole rest of the day and wouldn\u2019t tell anyone why because he doesn\u2019t want to be a tattle tale. I asked Jude if anything else had happened between the 2 of them and he promised me it didn\u2019t and said they\u2019ve even been playing together at recess this whole last week. And her daughter was trying to cheer him up by suggesting ways to sneak him in.\n\nI\u2019m honestly livid, I wouldn\u2019t care if she had given neither of them an invite but giving one twin and not the other is incredibly rude and passive aggressive. I\u2019m considering calling her and talking about it because I think it\u2019s ridiculous to hold this much of a grudge against a 5 year old. Would that make me an AH? Should I just decline Jonahs invite? I think the birthday rule is silly and it\u2019s her choice who she invites but this is just ridiculous.\n\nEdit: Synagogue and School are 2 separate places, but there\u2019s a lot of overlap with the people. Also, I\u2019m not planning on sending either of them to the party at the moment, but I\u2019m considering calling her to confront her about it rather than just having this weird dynamic where I\u2019m hearing things from Jude that come from her kid that come from her.", "created_utc": 1701691957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18aix6c/wibta_if_i_called_a_little_girls_mother_to_ask/", "score": 2023, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This might be discussed.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry. This woman is crazy.", "NTA but I wouldn't bother. You know why he wasn't invited and while it's cruel to exclude him for something he did by accident, don't escalate it further. Decline the invite and just let it be.

If you don't think it's fair, don't send either kid and don't send a gift. This nonsense of \"it's customary to invite the whole class\" thing needs to stop.

It being \"customary\" for employees to invite every coworker so as not to offend anyone. Eventually, your kid is going to need to learn that not everyone is going to like him and he's not going to be invited to every party.

The initial conversation with the mom where she said you have to punish your son seemed weird to me. Had the girl only been friends with one of your sons, maybe the party invite would have been more understandable. But here, it seems the girl is friends with both of your sons, and the party invite was just the mom being ultra petty about the bathroom incident.", "Ywbta.

She wanted you to punish a 5 year old for walking into the bathroom and then fleeing. To me she thinks her behavior is justified. Most likely because she doesn't think you punished him enough so now she is trying to do it herself. \n\nDon't let one twin go and not the other. Tell them that the girls mom is being mean to them both because she only wants one to go. Instead take them out the day of the party.

We\u2019re not even mentioning the fact that she didn\u2019t lock the door. But let me get onto the point because I am a parent of two teenagers, and there was a similar situation that happened in my children\u2019s day school back when they were your kids age. It became tradition to hand out birthday invitations in school, but at some point not every kid was getting invitations to every party And it became a real problem, lots of hurt feelings. \n\nSo I actually think the answer to your situation is right there in the beginning of your post, which is to do the very thing you said you didn\u2019t really want to do: go to the school. Especially if it\u2019s a Jewish day school there is obviously a very family oriented vibe to those types of schools and I think the head of school would take it very seriously. It\u2019s one thing to choose who you want to give out birthday invitations to, it is a completely different thing to hand them out in front of everybody and make a child feel excluded. After the drama unfolded at my kids\u2019 school, they passed a rule that birthday invites would no longer be allowed to be given out in the classroom. If you could get that change made, I think it would send a very strong signal to that mother that she was a fucking asshole and you could feel better about having prevented future kids from experiencing what your one son did i.e. the social pain of being left out. This woman is a complete fucking monster and weaponized a little kids birthday party to punish your child. It\u2019s actually insane and I think the school needs to know about it immediately. While it may not result in Jude getting an invite, it will certainly make the story \u201cgo public\u201d, when the rest of the parents find out that invites will not be handed out in class anymore because recently one mother invited everyone in the class except for your child. People will start asking who, and hopefully she will take the reputation hit she deserves. \n\nYour story made my blood boil.  Do not be quiet on this, you have the right of it and this woman needs to learn her lesson, she is toxic and likely the complete opposite of the values of the school. Honestly, this is tantamount to bullying to me and it happened on school property from a parent to a child - it must be addressed.", "NTA, but why?  That itch won\u2019t change.  I suggest NOT telling your kids anything except that they can\u2019t go because y\u2019all have something special planned on that day. Go do something special.

At the end of the day, she left the bathroom door unlocked and a little kid walked in. Shit happens, it was a mistake. The fact that she\u2019s taken it this far tells me there\u2019s nothing about that woman that makes me want our kids to hang out together. \n\nPolitley decline the invite for your one son, and take the boys somewhere fun for the day. Also, have a chat with your other boy so he doesn\u2019t internalize this forever.", "Nta take the boys elsewhere on her birthday.", "Definitely call the school and let them know because you don't know what else she will do.

Normally, I wouldn\u2019t advocate confronting another parent over party invites.  But this was so obviously done to single one of your twins out.  She\u2019s being petty and is punishing you through your child as she doesn\u2019t approve of your parenting style.  I mean, your son apologized at the time and you told her you\u2019d take care of it.   Frankly, it\u2019s none of her business how you take care of it.  And you did take care of it by having a conversation with your son about being more aware.  \n\nDo it in a non-confrontational way.  Ask her if it was an oversight that one twin got an invite but the other didn\u2019t.  She\u2019ll either own it or prevaricate and backtrack. \n\nIf she owns it, you follow up with asking her why she would invite one twin and not the other.

She may or may not finally admit the real reason.  \n\nIf she does, this gives you the opportunity to express your shock that she would be so harsh over a mistake that even adults make, as we all have walked into the wrong public restroom in error.  If she doesn\u2019t but stands her ground, you have to decide whether or not to allow your other son to attend alone.   Personally, if she stood her ground, I would likely decline by telling her that you\u2019re aware her daughter wanted to invite Jude as the two children have talked during recess, that this sort of passive-aggressive parenting by unauthorized proxy isn\u2019t okay.  \n\nIf she backtracks and invites Jude, I\u2019d be inclined to let it go.  You will have made your point and essentially called her out on this BS.  Keeping your sons away makes the children the collateral damage in this battle.

Ask her about the bathroom incident and if it is still upsetting her. Ask if she thinks that you are not strict enough with your kids. Ask her if her daughter understands why she has to treat your twins differently. Ask her to imagine having twins who are both friends with another child, but only one was invited to the party. What would she do? In this way, you are causing her to consider the consequences of her actions, but you are not telling her what to do. \n\nThis is also an important teaching moment for your family.
