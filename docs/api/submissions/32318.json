They go to a private Jewish kindergarten where it\u2019s very customary to invite the whole class to birthday parties, it might even be a school rule but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to take this to the school.\n\nJude and Jonah are very well mannered and reserved, obviously I\u2019m biased but they\u2019ve always gotten along with all of their peers and have never gotten into any drama. Jude is definitely a slow reader and we\u2019ve gotten him a tutor but it\u2019s still been very hard for him.\n\nAt our synagogue the bathroom signs just say men and women with no little picture and they are single bathrooms. 2 weekends ago Jude walked into the women\u2019s by accident and I guess the door wasn\u2019t locked correctly because he walked in on this women named Jess who is the mother of a little girl in his class. He says he just saw her on the toilet and ran out, closed the door and said sorry. \n\nJude immediately came up to me and told me and he was very embarrassed. I told him it wasn\u2019t a big deal and he should just remember to knock next time and the longer word says women. He said he will and that he thought it would be a stalled bathroom like most public bathrooms and that\u2019s fair so I left it there.\n\nJess came up to talk to me after and told me like he needed to be punished, she said it was extremely inappropriate. I assured her he didn\u2019t know and wouldn\u2019t do it again but she said there\u2019s \u201cno way he can\u2019t read men and women\u201d and that her daughter can and told me I had to nip this behavior in the bud. I often feel talked down to because of my age by other parents at the school so I just said I would take care of it and left it there.\n\nOn Friday her daughter was handing out birthday invites and gave one to Jonah, not Jude. They both asked her why and she said her mom said not to give him one and wouldn\u2019t tell her why. Jude cried the whole rest of the day and wouldn\u2019t tell anyone why because he doesn\u2019t want to be a tattle tale. I asked Jude if anything else had happened between the 2 of them and he promised me it didn\u2019t and said they\u2019ve even been playing together at recess this whole last week. And her daughter was trying to cheer him up by suggesting ways to sneak him in.\n\nI\u2019m honestly livid, I wouldn\u2019t care if she had given neither of them an invite but giving one twin and not the other is incredibly rude and passive aggressive. I\u2019m considering calling her and talking about it because I think it\u2019s ridiculous to hold this much of a grudge against a 5 year old. Would that make me an AH? Should I just decline Jonahs invite? I think the birthday rule is silly and it\u2019s her choice who she invites but this is just ridiculous.", "created_utc": 1701691957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18aix6c/wibta_if_i_called_a_little_girls_mother_to_ask/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That woman has issues..", "YWNBTA\n\nBut you will be wasting your time since the reason he was excluded is pretty obvious.\n\nIt's a disgraceful, shitty, and downright petty thing to do to a wean because of an accident, but she's throwing the party so it's her choice.\n\nThe best thing I can suggest is you take both your weans for a day out instead of letting just one attend the party, I'd also suggest maybe getting Jude tested for Dyslexia because that might be why he's having issues reading or change the way he's learning because not all methods work the same way (I was taught to read in an unusual way and it resulted in me reading way above my age group, it also resulted in me being a heavy reader to the point where I was once reading 7 to 8 books a week).", "Nta. \n\nIm sure theres gotta be something about taking out anger for the mistakes of children on the child in your scripture right? Im sure that (equivalent of pastor) would agree that punishing a child for an innocent mistake made in his house of worship because the woman was careless and forgot to lock the door doesnt warrant this behavior to a child, right?\n\n100% id bring it up, either to the school or synagogue about her treatment to your child.", "Edit: WBNTA. \n\nI misred and thought your son surprised the little girl on the toilet.  \n\nThis is why i wrote the following:\n\n A five year old is free to decide if she wants both twins there or not. \n\nEven if the situation with the toilet was an accident, it was certainly very very unpleasent for the girl. When I was five that would have been enough for me to not invite someone.   \n\nA five year old girl should not have to learn that her boundaries do not matter and that she has to invite a boy after such an incident...\n\nIt might be different if you think the mother made that decision and not the girl. This might be discussed.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry. This woman is crazy.", "NTA but I wouldn't bother. You know why he wasn't invited and while it's cruel to exclude him for something he did by accident, don't escalate it further. Decline the invite and just let it be. I think it would be even more uncomfortable for the kids involved since it seems like this lady is already involving her daughter by forcing her to leave out one twin.", "Yes, YWBTA\n\nWhile her reasoning might be ridiculous, it's her right to not invite your kid. If you don't think it's fair, don't send either kid and don't send a gift. This nonsense of \"it's customary to invite the whole class\" thing needs to stop. I couldn't care less what the reasoning is behind not inviting someone.... It's their party they can invite (or not invite) whomever they want. \n\nCould you imagine if this type of dynamic in the work place?... It being \"customary\" for employees to invite every coworker so as not to offend anyone. Eventually, your kid is going to need to learn that not everyone is going to like him and he's not going to be invited to every party. IMO, it's better to learn it at a younger age than it is later.", "What would you want and expect to come out of your phone call? You know the answer to both. Just decline the invite for Jonah and go do something fun with the kids. Ignore the hateful woman. Let it go. Be the bigger person. YWBTAH if you called her.", "How do you envision this conversation will go?  Do you think it will be well received?  Do you think it will resolve anything or inflame things further?  I think the woman's behaviour is wrong, but YWBTA and two wrongs don't make it right.", "YWNBTA. However, you're not going to achieve anything by it. This is obviously a woman who is a monomaniac, shading your boy on the basis of one accidental mistake. Rather than waste your breath at her, use this as an opportunity to teach Jonah how exclusion works, why people do it, and how one must combat it. Then let him decide whether he wants to go to the party.", "That's nasty they are brothers \ud83d\ude15 and kids making such a drama from that traumatized a 5 year old boy she's a B....", "Call her up and give her a piece of your k8nd, but dont send either boy and no gifts\u2026.", "YWBTA  \nYou're not entitled a invites for anything, neither your son.  \nYour kids can even be good friends, your son can be sad ( it sucks, but it's a thing that he will need to learn about living in society), but she(the mom) is the one that is founding and planning the party.  \nJust it.  \n\n\nleave her alone, and IF YOU FEEL LIKE, offer the olive branch invinting her and her girl in your boy's next birthday.  \nor not, not every bridge burned deserve to be rebuilt", "Jess is definitely being unreasonable, but you don\u2019t have to take her bait to make it worse. I would call her and ask if there was a mistake and if she meant to invite both boys. Have her specifically speak to why she thinks your son should be punished for something so innocent. If she says it wasn\u2019t a mistake then thank her for her explanation, and tell her both boys won\u2019t be in attendance in a polite and calm manner. I would schedule something fun for the boys on that day so they don\u2019t feel so bad for not going.", "Tell her to stop taking shits in the kids bathroom.", "NTA. \n\nThe mother of the girl knows exactly what she is doing.. she is TA.\n\nJust tell her that your boys(emphasis boy'S) will not be attending", "NTA\n\nI think the friend's mom is being overly dramatic & petty about the whole situation. I think given all the factors (like no picture, he's 5 yrs old, etc) are enough to show that the bathroom incident was a simple mistake that could have happened to any kid in similar circumstances. The initial conversation with the mom where she said you have to punish your son seemed weird to me. Had the girl only been friends with one of your sons, maybe the party invite would have been more understandable. But here, it seems the girl is friends with both of your sons, and the party invite was just the mom being ultra petty about the bathroom incident.", "Ywbta.  I think it\u2019s ridiculous that whole classes have to be invited to parties.  It should be up to the parents and child who they want to invite to their home.  Just decline the invite and move on.", "NTA. But don't call this woman. She is getting off on bullying a little boy and his mother because he made a very common mistake a lot of children make. \n\nSeriously though do not call her, she obviously doesn't care that she is bullying a 5 year old. She wanted you to punish a 5 year old for walking into the bathroom and then fleeing. To me she thinks her behavior is justified. Most likely because she doesn't think you punished him enough so now she is trying to do it herself. \n\nDon't let one twin go and not the other. Tell them that the girls mom is being mean to them both because she only wants one to go. Instead take them out the day of the party. Go to a fun place they enjoy or take them to the park or to get pizza. The only thing talking to that woman will do is take years off your life and put you in the same bracket as her.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d also point out that there\u2019s no way an adult doesn\u2019t know how to lock a door and someone should nip her behaviour in the bud.", "NTA for the simple fact that one twin was invited but not the other all because the kid had to potty and did not take the extra second to check the word. He made a mistake any kid would make. They tend to have a one track mind at that age. Poor kid already felt embarrassed, but now feeling worse because one mom overreacted to a simple mistake. SMH", "Normally I'd go with the person who's birthday it is get to decide who to invite, but this time I think it's fairly reasonable to ask why one of the twins weren't invited. Passive aggressiveness towards a 5 year old is never ok.

Don\u2019t take either kid and do something nice instead.", "I think that YWNBTA but since this woman is clearly insane, I just wouldn't do it.", "How bizarre is this woman\u2019s behavior!\n\nYWNBTA if you ask her but honestly, I don\u2019t foresee anything constructive or productive coming from it if you do.\n\nThis lady is awful and given how she approached you after he walked into the bathroom, she\u2019s unsympathetic to the cause.\n\nShe\u2019s cruel enough to punish a 5 year old bc she was embarrassed from an innocent mistake.

My sister was considered delayed when she couldn't read by 5. Like, extra tutoring, being assessed for a learning disability considered delayed. As it turned out, she was just not keen on doing things she wasn't immediately good at, and by the time we moved when she was 6.5, her teacher took our parents aside to tell them they shouldn't push her so much, as she was reading well above age level. She could still identify the ladies vs gents toilets by 5.\n\nHowever, even if the child could read fluently, this woman is massively overreacting to a child of 5 bursting in on her...

Children with hyperlexia can learn to read as early as age 3, and will have greatly accelerated reading comprehension until everyone else catches up around age 9-10.\n\nI say 'condition' because while it might seem like a good thing to have a child who is so good at reading, 90% of children who display hyperlexia are autistic. It's probably demonstrative of a very early special interest/hyperfixation.", "It\u2019s not expected for a five-year old to be able to read.
