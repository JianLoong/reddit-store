Stop enabling your brother.", "YWNBTA - Bro is using you and will continue to do so with no concern for your $$ stability. With every week that passes you being reimbursed slips further away. Yes, your wife and you should be concerned on an alarming level.\n\nHe can't generate cash now do you think he can give you $3,333 a month to pay this off in a year? How about  $1,666 months (2 yrs), $1,111 (3 yrs). You pissed money away and now you can't invest it for how many years?\n\nAre you giving him the money or paying the services directly? His behavior is concerning as in is the $$ supporting an addiction? He needs to be a food stamps, energy supplement discounts....all the things. The act of applying and being interviewed kicks many prideful folks but let-him-go-threw-this!  Perhaps he has a history of others saving him (hard to tell).\n\nHow does he answer when you ask....there are no jobs? A year of unemployment is hard to imagine. The headlines are filled with various industries who need people on the daily. He needs to get any job or create one. There are hiring agencies who want to place him.\n\nIf he has no money why the heck are you paying COBRA??  This is crazy expensive.  If in the US he should qualify for poverty insurance (Medicaid) or insurance market place. Best to you. You stated a deadline and he blew you off. He is not taking this issue serious.", "NTA, and bro IS using you so he doesn't have to look for a job. Stop enabling him and put yourself and your SO first without guilt.", "I have always told people not to let their close ones borrow money... family or friend... I do let some people borrow $20 or $100, but in the thousand, you got me fu*ed up!", "NTA\n\nBy now, he should have been able to get some kind of job or have put his house up for sale or something.  You will never see the money you've \"lent\" him.\n\n\"Sorry,Bro, I can't afford to give you any more money.  You'll need to figure out something else.\"", "NTA. Stop giving him money. You're not getting it back. He's a grown man.", "YWNBTA. Why should the financial strains of one person be dumped on another? You\u2019ve lent far more than most people would or even could. Your brother needs to make some effort. If it takes being broke to motivate him, so be it. You\u2019ve been beyond generous.", "NTA.  My husband I have been giving money to a niece of mine and she just asked for more, and I can't do it because it will cause us to start to suffer financially.  I feel so bad about it, but I have to draw the line somewhere.  You have given more than enough.  It's okay to stop.", "NTA, but you would be the AH if you lend him any more money. He needs a dose of reality, and its so hard to be the one that delivers it.\n\nHe might still not get a job and you might never see the 40k returned. He might get in trouble if you dont lend him money, but that's how it is. If you keep saving him, he won't stop. Ever.\n\nYou've already done what you can, you been supportive and helpful. Now he is starting to take advantage of you and then it's no longer a fair deal.", "NTA \n\nFor not loaning him the money, and frankly YWBTA If you do. \n\nYou're enabling his behavior, it's time to stop this, and only you can. \n\nIf you want to help him, take him to refinance **HIS** house and he can try to pull equity out. You giving him cash isn't helping", "NTA. The rule when you lend money is they can't borrow more until the first loan is paid off.", "instead, help him find a job and if he refuses any help or suggestions then you really know he's a lost cause...", "YWNBTA.  Just say NO you can\u2019t do it. You don\u2019t have to explain, or make excuses, or say it\u2019s because your partner is getting angry (don\u2019t throw them under the bus).  A simple \u201csorry , no, I can\u2019t do that\u201d is a full sentence.", "NTA.  You told him you can't keep giving him money (these are not \"loans\" if he has no way to pay them back), yet he asked you again.  At this point your own finances are strained, so you can't keep giving him any money even if you wanted to.\n\nNo means no.  Maybe without your safety net, he'll be more motivated to make an extra effort to get a job.  At this point you are basically enabling him, to your own, and his, detriment.", "NTA.\n\nYour SO is right to be POed. And the 40K he owes you is gone. And I also agree with your take that he's using you to keep from making a sincere effort at finding a job.\n\nAlso, even if you do lend him money, never put it in his hands. Have him give you a bill, then you pay it. Buy him groceries instead of giving him money for groceries.", "You have to take care of yourself first. No one can tell you what to do with your money. I know how hard it is to get a job when you desperately need one but you have to be willing to do anything. Sell plasma, works in fast food and do free lance rather than borrowing money you likely cannot pay back. Tell him it's putting a strain on you and you cannot afford to lend him any money. Maybe it's time he downsize.", "NTA for not wanting to compromise your finances for his sake.\n\nTry not to get mad at him.... I was without a job for 18 months and it was fucking demoralizing.", "NTA You gave your brother 40 k and he is asking for more. Unles he is disabled and unable to work, he needs to find a job any job that he can do.  As long as you keep funding him he will not look. YWBTA if you keep giving him money risking your own financial health.", "YTA \n\nBut not for saying no, for allowing him to get this deep in debt with you when he's got no opportunities on the horizon to pay you back. \n\nIf he's not going to put fourth an honest effort he has got to accept his circumstances and start living within his means. \n\nThere is ALWAYS a job available, just not always the perfect job. Retail/food industry is always looking for people and if he was serious about paying his bills and debts he would be working 2 part time jobs to make ends meat. \n\nCUT HIM OFF!!!", "If it\u2019s a mortgage he also has a house he can presumably sell. Assuming he has equity that gives him some cash and he can get a small apartment. \n\nI think I had COBRA for like a month one time? It\u2019s outrageous."]}
