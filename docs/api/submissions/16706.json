Mike is living with his fianc\u00e9e Sara (30f) and her daughter from a previous relationship Eve (6). Sara works from home as a freelancer.\n\nEver since the move I went to hang out at Mike\u2019s a lot because I miss him. Sara and I got along OK, but Eve was attached to me from the start. She said I look like one of the princess dolls she has. Thus our friendship is born.\n\nOne of the activities Eve and I enjoy is styling our hair. Our hair is very similar: long, blonde, fine and super straight. We enjoy braiding, curling and ornamenting our locks, as Sara has had short hair all her life and cannot style her daughter\u2019s hair beyond a simple ponytail. Eve loved it when I put our hair in matching styles and we often went to dinner like that. My brother and Sara thought it was adorable.\n\nA few days ago an incident at school caused Eve\u2019s hair to be damaged. Sara took her to the salon but the best they could do was cut and trim her hair to just above shoulder\u2019s length. Eve was crying and really upset; she said she won\u2019t get to play hair styling and have matching hair with me anymore since her hair is short now. She said it\u2019s not fair that I will be the only princess in the family now. \n\nSara called me and asked if I can cut my hair to match with Eve so she wouldn\u2019t be sad. She said it will be a nice change of pace and our hair will grow back. \n\nI told her no. A trim of an inch is one thing but shoulder length is too short for my liking. Sara said I\u2019m not being considerate as it\u2019ll mean a lot to Eve to know her aunt matches with her. \n\nMike said my hair my decision, but my mom said it would be a nice thing to do.

GB left a pretty intact system when we gained independence (infrastructure, schools, courts etc.) which we then used to modernise our country. So colonisation is a thing of the past, well for a majority of us anyway. \n\nCharles and the BRF have always been supportive of the Commonwealth, and hopefully those ties will continue to mature and strengthen.

You think I called her tampon lady because she is a woman? No. I called her that bc in the 90s when Charles and Diana were still married there was a leaked tape of a phone convo between Charles and Camilla where he said he wanted to be a tampon in her. It\u2019s a very famous incident that might not have been such a big deal in 1st world countries, but it was a HUGE deal in other nations where they\u2019re more reticent about discussing things like periods, sex, tampon use isn\u2019t really a thing bc pads are barely available in fact there was a whole movie about it (Padman starring Akshay Kumar, feel free to watch). It\u2019s an incident that stuck out to many people of these countries and especially after Diana died was a bit deal. You may not know but Diana, for all her faults, still did a lot of charity work in India particularly in making people feel safe to touch people with HIV/AIDS and even people with leprosy as you may not know, formerly there were leper colonies where people with leprosy would be forced to live together far away from the cities and their families.", "Is that your name?", "there isn't anyone who doesn't know about the tampon phone call or that Diana did charity work, babes.  i'm saying referring to her as \"the tampon lady\" is pretty damn sexist .... which has nothing to do with leper colonies?", "Seriously.

The Irish went through hell to escape English rule and Scotland has a strong independance movement too.\n\n>And I\u2019m sorry, but being from Wales, another white country, is NOT the same as being from a former colony of POC so please don\u2019t try and act like it is. \n\nHmm.  Well only those within the UK are required to be part of it without a say in that.  All the overseas colonies can freely leave whenever they choose to, but many don't for various reasons such as security and trade.

Not enough Information", "Wow, you guys are harsh. Of course OP is NTA, but kindness and empathy would go a long way here. While we don't know exactly what happened at school, if the child was bullied and that's  why she had to have her hair cut,  she may be traumatized. Even if it was just an accident that caused it, her world is crashing down.  She's only 6 for heaven's sake. It sounds to me more that she's upset that she and her aunt won't be able to play together like they used to. We also don't know if her mother did all the things you all are insisting on, but her child is inconsolable. I don't  think asking is a problem, and it's up to OP to create her boundaries.

She\u2019s really little and really sad about her hair. That said, it\u2019s absolutely fair and appropriate to say no.

If you were already saying to people \"you know, I really want to change up my hair sometime,\" I could see suggesting it, but beyond that, nah.\n\nI feel awful for Eve, because I went from butt length to shoulder length as an *adult* and the year and a half it took to grow back was PAINFUL (turns out I really do prefer it ungodly long and am not \"just used to it\").  And for a little kid that's an eon.  I had more than my share of bad haircuts as a kid.  But it WILL grow back.  Maybe now is the time for Eve to get cool colored streaks or something so she feels better about it, though, it could be fun for her.\n\nFor the people saying this could be a teachable moment, I agree, but not about patience or being beautiful with any type of hair.  I think this could be a great time for learning that your parents cannot fix everything that goes wrong in your life, but they can be sympathetic and understanding and listen when you feel sad.  Time for Sara to get in there and agree that yeah, this sucks and she wishes it didn't happen too.  The best lesson your kid can learn is \"my family is there for me.\"  No, this isn't a huge deal tragedy...to an adult.  To a six year old?  It's a big deal.  It's okay for her to be upset.  No one needs to \"make her feel better.\"  She WILL get over it eventually, but give her time to get there.", "NAH \n\n\nIf you can get some princess dolls and cut their off.
