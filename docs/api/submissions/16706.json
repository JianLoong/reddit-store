Mike is living with his fianc\u00e9e Sara (30f) and her daughter from a previous relationship Eve (6). Sara works from home as a freelancer.\n\nEver since the move I went to hang out at Mike\u2019s a lot because I miss him. Sara and I got along OK, but Eve was attached to me from the start. She said I look like one of the princess dolls she has. Thus our friendship is born.\n\nOne of the activities Eve and I enjoy is styling our hair. Our hair is very similar: long, blonde, fine and super straight. We enjoy braiding, curling and ornamenting our locks, as Sara has had short hair all her life and cannot style her daughter\u2019s hair beyond a simple ponytail. Eve loved it when I put our hair in matching styles and we often went to dinner like that. My brother and Sara thought it was adorable.\n\nA few days ago an incident at school caused Eve\u2019s hair to be damaged. Sara took her to the salon but the best they could do was cut and trim her hair to just above shoulder\u2019s length. Eve was crying and really upset; she said she won\u2019t get to play hair styling and have matching hair with me anymore since her hair is short now. She said it\u2019s not fair that I will be the only princess in the family now. \n\nSara called me and asked if I can cut my hair to match with Eve so she wouldn\u2019t be sad. She said it will be a nice change of pace and our hair will grow back. \n\nI told her no. A trim of an inch is one thing but shoulder length is too short for my liking. Sara said I\u2019m not being considerate as it\u2019ll mean a lot to Eve to know her aunt matches with her. \n\nMike said my hair my decision, but my mom said it would be a nice thing to do.
