{"id": 17173, "submission_id": "13gx56z", "title": "AITA for defending my brother after he proposed to her girlfriend at my sister's reception?", "selftext": "Last Saturday my sister Rosie got married. It was a simple ceremony in the courtyard outside the hall and then some dinner, drinks and dancing. Rosie and her husband Billy wanted to keep it under \u00a37000 and they spent most of it on the dinner and reception for the guests. They had the actual wedding when the sun was setting and did the photos before the ceremony instead of afterwards. Which I thought was a good idea and will follow suit if I ever get married. \n\nAfter the dinner during the reception my brother Danny proposed to his girlfriend Jamie. He said he was mesmerized by her when they were dancing and decided it was the time. Rosie is angry at Danny for doing it at her reception in front of her guests. Now Danny has been with Jamie for almost 3 years. Me and Rosie among others knew Danny had been talking about proposing. He had bought a ring a few days before. Rosie's only objection was that he did it at the reception.\n\nRosie and Danny purposely did not have a large wedding on purpose. They didn't have a lot of the normal wedding things. They had it night so they didn't keep their guests all day. Even for the honeymoon they only went to Aberystwyth, and spent two nights there. They drove back home Monday morning.\n\nIt's out of character for Rosie (and Billy) to be upset about other people getting attention or not getting attention. They had a small wedding on purpose. Rosie is angry at Danny and at me for defending him. She already had her photos and ceremony and the reception was half over. Had Danny done it at the ceremony or if Rosie had a big wedding and wanted more attention I would think differently.\n\nAm I TA for defending Danny? I'm not married but if I was getting married I would have been excited and happy for Danny and Jamie. I did think Jamie asking the photographer to take engagement portraits was slightly rude. But I can't blame her that much because she was so excited. Is it really that big of a deal? I don't feel like it's a problem and I think Rosie and Billy and others who are angry at Danny are overreacting. I'm surprised because this is out of character for Rosie to get upset about something like this. I think we should be happy for Danny and Jamie. Their engagement is a good thing.

So, that means what...that because it's smaller, it's not as important?  YTA.  Your brother is definitely the asshole for doing it at her reception (and also is apparently an idiot who has been living under a rock, if he didn't know that it's EXTREMELY poor etiquette to propose at someone else's wedding).  And you're the asshole for defending him.", "YTA. It is NEVER acceptable to hijack someone else's event. Your sister may have wanted a small, low-key wedding, but she wanted the focus of the entire event to be her and her new husband. \n\nDanny could have proposed privately if he was so \"mesmerized\" by Jamie's dancing and then announced said engagement at a later time. \n\nYou owe your sister and her husband an apology.

And hijacking the photographer? Holy hell. Y\u2019all all owe the bride and groom a huge apology.", "Regardless of how big or how small the wedding was, it was your sister's moment and wedding and your oaf of a brother stomped all over it. \n\nYou and he are both collosal assholes. \n\nYTA and he's the asshole.   I cannot believe you are defending him when he used his sister's dime to take engagement photos.  I hope your sister burns them instead of giving them to him.", "You keep saying your sister purposefully had a small wedding, as if that has any relevance at all. It's very rude to steal the spotlight at someone else's celebration, regardless of size. YTA.", "YTA\n\nAnd Danny is also AH. No matter the size/type of the event, a wedding is about the the two people getting married. It is their event, their time, their rules. Proposing during their event without asking for permission beforehand is incredibly rude and inappropriate.", "YTA. It doesn't matter how you'd react to this if it happened to you. It was Rosie's day and your brother interfered. Try and see it from her perspective and not your own.", "YTA, as are Danny and Jamie.  Do any of you have any sense of manners whatsoever?  I guess it really would have killed Danny (and Jamie) to let someone else have the spotlight for one day.", "YTA\n\nOnly bc you don't recognize that proper protocol in these situations is to ask the bride and groom beforehand. It's fine if he got caught up in the moment, but he could have stepped aside and asked them first. They aren't upset that they are engaged, but that they didn't even ask and did it at their small wedding. Maybe their wedding was small because that's all they could afford or they are saving for something else. But either way it was their day and they deserves to be alerted first.", "YTA.. Wedding Days are to celebrate the Bride and Groom. It's massively disrespectful to them for someone else to propose at a wedding without any warning and you've defended this behavior, which is just as disrespectful.\n\nNo wonder the Bride is ticked.", "YTA -  You are the a-hole. There are 231+ other days to conduct a proposal in 2023. Never at a wedding. Why couldn't the 3 of 'you be happy' for Rosie and hubby for 24 hours by not interrupting their marriage day with selfishness?!\n\nYou're demeaning when describing their wedding. Is was 'less than' so it was 'ok' for a proposal to occur?! How incredibly hurtful to the bride, groom and parents (who had one day to witness their child marry). Stop justifying your defense of their thoughtless act.", "YTA. You're neither Rosie nor Billy.", "YTA.  It's never ok to hijack someone else's event no matter how big or small it is.  Then they pulled the photographer that they didn't even pay for, for engagement pictures? That's so trashy. \n\nIt also doesn't matter how you would have felt because it's not about you. None of this is about you, so why did you have to stick your nose in it?

Instead of being happy for his sister and her new husband and celebrating that, he made it all about himself.", "YTA. \n\nDanny is t a h.  \n\nYou all suck.", "YTA. Everyone except bride and groom. Asking for engagement pictures at the wedding? That\u2019s the tackiest thing I\u2019ve ever read and you are defending it.", "YTA, and your brother is.  There are four cardinal rules for wedding guests:\n\n* Do not wear white.  \n* Do not steal the gifts.  \n* Do not bring kids if they're not invited.\n* ***Do not propose at someone else's wedding***  \n\nThe only exception for any of these if the bride AND groom, in person, and without any duress, give both permission and blessing.  \n\nThey obviously did not.\n\nWhy don't you go and have a birthday party, and let someone else hijack it for their graduation or promotion?  \n\nY'all TAs.", "Yta. Your bro basically commandeered a party that he did not plan or pay for that was to honour your sisters wedding and turned it into his own free engagement party. It doesnt matter how small or inexpensive the wedding was. It was your sis wedding.That was selfish,classless and tacky of your bro. Basic etiquette and manners you never ever propose announce an engagement or pregnancy at someone elses event unless you specifically get their permission. And him asking the wedding photographer to take some engagement photos wasn't \"slightly rude\" it was presumptuous and arrogant. The photog was there to take photos of her wedding.\nYou don't get a vote or opinion on how she should share her day just because you think you would be happy on your hypothetical day. Your brother was 1000% in the wrong and you are too", "Well, Danny and Jamie were the huge assholes here, but yes, a very big YTA for standing up for him.\n\nDanny could have waited until after the wedding ceremony was over. It's horribly, ridiculously rude to propose at a wedding, and there really is zero excuse for it.", "You and your brother are the AH. You should never make someone else event your event - unless you have permission. The fact that your brother purchase the ring just days before the wedding and made his sister wedding about him and not her happiness is rude. Also, his fiance asking the photographer to take engagement pictures is very tacky. He hijacked an event to save money and planning. The fact that it was a small party is more disgusting because his proposal was seen by the full  party and took attention from the bride and groom.\n\nHe should apologize to your sister and pay for the photographer. If he doesn't, he doesn't care about his sister. You should also apologize. I hope your sister holds their pictures hostage until they apologize.", "You and Danny are As. I had a very similar wedding to your sister's because my partner and I didn't think a one-time party was worth throwing away a ton of money (think about spending 7,000 euro on one party). We also wanted the day to be about us and our love, not about the flowers or the cake or the venue or whatever. Your brother took that away from them. It was no longer about them and a celebration of their love, but about a celebration of your brother and his girlfriend. Some people are fine with engagements at their wedding, but honestly, most are not. He should have asked first. And he can't say he got caught up in the moment if he brought the ring with him to the wedding - sounds planned to me.", "YTA \nDanny was wrong. Period. And you trying to defend him is wrong too.", "YTA. As someone else said it is never ok to highjack someone\u2019s wedding to propose. Whether it\u2019s a big wedding or a small intimate affair. In fact I\u2019d say that it being small makes it even worse because it\u2019s even more obvious and even more the center of attention. And yeah how did she have the gall to ask thorium sister\u2019s wedding photographer to take engagement pictures? Honestly?!", "YTA and so is your brother. It was your sister's special day and your brother took the attention away from the couple, and his girlfriend hijacked the photographer for engagement photos. In what universe is that OK? The size of the celebration is irrelevant.", "The first rule of weddings is don't upstage the bride. Your brother is an AH and YTA too if you defend him. If he doesn't apologize he shouldn't be surprised when sis shows up at his wedding wearing white.", "YTA. You should never propose at a wedding unless you have permission from the bride and groom first. What your brother did was the epitome of trash. He used your sister's party so he didn't have to plan or pay for anything on his own. It's disgusting and you're disgusting for supporting him.", "YTA\n\nIt is tacky to make someone else's event about you. It was your sister's wedding. The event was about then and the focus should've stayed on them. your brother could've waited till after to ask his gf out asked  the couple beforehand if they'd be ok with him proposing. He did neither and that's kinda rude. You should've stayed out of it or acknowledged general etiquette would make Danny the ah", "There is literally zero question, YTA, but your attention seeking brother is a bigger ah. There is no way he didn\u2019t have this planned, and hitch makes it worse. Also for the balls of the gf to grab the photographer to get pictures taken. Honestly the more I type, the more positive I am the they would be cut out of my life.", "YTA\u2014 it was your sister\u2019s wedding.. small or not, your brother should absolutely not have proposed. Your sister already said to NOT do it at her reception and he did it anyways.. \n\nAnd Jamie asking the photographer to take photos when Rosie was paying that photographer?! Rude is an understatement", "You spend multiple sentences going out of your way to denigrate your sister's wedding - as if it's less valid because it's less traditional, so totally fine for your brother to take a day about them and instead make it about himself. \n\n>I did think Jamie asking the photographer to take engagement portraits was slightly rude. \n\nYou're fucking joking right? I actually hope you're a troll because otherwise the level of obtuse is really sad. ESH except your poor sister.", "YTA -- not your wedding, not your reception to be upset about. Rosie and Billy get this once in their lives, and they deserve to have it go as they want. If they're upset, they are valid to be upset\n\nGod, what I would GIVE to have the confidence of a mediocre man to be like, \"I can decide how everyone should feel about the consequences of my actions\"", "YTA for defending outrageous behavior by your brother.  It was selfish and inconsiderate for Danny to propose at someone else's wedding.  The size and organization of the wedding is completely irrelevant.

Your brothers behaviour is outrageous and you are TA for defending his nonsense", "YTA...We also just had a small wedding under $10,000 canadian and we're weird about being the center of attention, but I would have physically fought someone who did this.

Not your wedding, not your right to defend or forgive.", "YTA \u2014 well more specifically your brother but you aren\u2019t much better for defending him. \nYou never upstage the bride, no matter how simple the wedding is.", "YTA\n\nAnyone proposing at another's  wedding without their permission are all AH.", "A wedding is about celebrating the couple that has just been married.\n\nAny major announcements on someone else\u2019s celebration is inappropriate. \n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nDid Danny pay half the cost of the reception so it could also be used for his engagement? Did he pay half the cost of the photographer? \n\nAnd even if those were answered as yes its still rude as fuck\n\nYou are entitled as hell, as is your brother.  \n\nA small intimate wedding is romantic as hell and is the last place you should propose unless the bride and groom give permission \n\n\nAlso you sound like a green eyed monster that no one wants to marry you.

It was a simple ceremony in the courtyard outside the hall and then some dinner, drinks and dancing. Rosie and her husband Billy wanted to keep it under \u00a37000 and they spent most of it on the dinner and reception for the guests. They had the actual wedding when the sun was setting and did the photos before the ceremony instead of afterwards. Which I thought was a good idea and will follow suit if I ever get married. \n\nAfter the dinner during the reception my brother Danny proposed to his girlfriend Jamie. He said he was mesmerized by her when they were dancing and decided it was the time. Rosie is angry at Danny for doing it at her reception in front of her guests. Now Danny has been with Jamie for almost 3 years. Me and Rosie among others knew Danny had been talking about proposing. He had bought a ring a few days before. Rosie's only objection was that he did it at the reception.\n\nRosie and Danny purposely did not have a large wedding on purpose. They didn't have a lot of the normal wedding things. They had it night so they didn't keep their guests all day. Even for the honeymoon they only went to Aberystwyth, and spent two nights there. They drove back home Monday morning.\n\nIt's out of character for Rosie (and Billy) to be upset about other people getting attention or not getting attention. They had a small wedding on purpose. Rosie is angry at Danny and at me for defending him. She already had her photos and ceremony and the reception was half over. Had Danny done it at the ceremony or if Rosie had a big wedding and wanted more attention I would think differently.\n\nAm I TA for defending Danny? I'm not married but if I was getting married I would have been excited and happy for Danny and Jamie. I did think Jamie asking the photographer to take engagement portraits was slightly rude. But I can't blame her that much because she was so excited. Is it really that big of a deal? I don't feel like it's a problem and I think Rosie and Billy and others who are angry at Danny are overreacting. I'm surprised because this is out of character for Rosie to get upset about something like this. I think we should be happy for Danny and Jamie. Their engagement is a good thing.

I own a DSLR camera and through high school and for years afterwards enjoy offering nice photos to my friends (for example, in high school I photographed them playing sports and gave all of them to the players including the ones I used in the yearbook). These kinds of photographs with this caliber of camera is so special to me that the level of assholery of the person saying no don\u2019t use it (presuming  they aren\u2019t doing much at the time) greatly exceeds the level of selfishness of asking for a few photos. My uncle is a professional photographer and I LOVE his photos of family events. I would never expect it for free but if he were around with his camera I would think because he loves me he would snap some and he often ends up as do I, as a backup wedding photographer (we pull groups of known people together such as three besties from elementary school or mom, grandma, kid) while the actual photographer gets dancing photos or eats etc. Usually in my case, the photographer dips early actually because they are only there 2-4 hours, so more than once I and my family have stepped up and are doing our best exit photos totally unexpected by the couple just because I value photos so much.

I would never. Reasonable to bill Danny and he probably should throw a few bucks their way for it. I would because I agree it is a major expense and I keep seething over her getting photos back and having to see them as part of HER day. But to ask the photographer for a discount is insane. I would say $200 is reasonable regardless of package price. $300 and people will say that\u2019s a lot of money when they were already there anyways, $100 and people will say that\u2019s all their worth? They are really paying for the editing of the photos more than anything which will be like you know, $20-$50 per photo and it\u2019s likely just a preset photoshop thing.

When it seems \"out of character\" for someone to be upset, maybe you should consider that the person in question isn't behaving oddly, but that the transgression is much worse than you perceive it to be.

Even with a small wedding, even with not doing a lot of traditional wedding things, it's the bride and groom's day, and most people should realize that a proposal at someone else's wedding is pretty tacky, especially swiping their photographer.

How is it still not common knowledge/sense that you do not propose to someone at someone else's wedding unless given explicit permission by the bride and groom?

A wedding ( big or small) is not a place to propose. Period. No ifs or buts. IT IS NOT YOUR DAY. IT IS THE BRIDE AND GROOMS DAY. How can you and your brother have a mentality so obtuse? You keep emphasizing that your sister purposefully had a small wedding as if that means a damn thing. They are validated in feeling hurt and angry because your brother broke one of the golden rules of a wedding and you defending him is an arsehole move. So what if their wedding and honeymoon was minimal? It was still their day and NO ONE has a right to take that away from them. They only get this opportunity once ( hopefully). Your brother would have had plenty of days to find his other half \" mesmerizing\" enough for him to propose to her. \n\nYour ignorance makes me very angry. You're a HARD AH!", "YTA-They aren\u2019t overreacting. It doesn\u2019t matter how small the wedding is, what time of day it\u2019s being held, if the people getting married usually don\u2019t have a problem sharing the spotlight. Nothing makes it okay to propose at a wedding/reception without permission from both parties getting married.", "I really hate how dismissive OP is over it being a small wedding. I'm sure Rosie had to bust her ass whining budget friendly options for months. Just because it was small doesn't mean she didn't work to keep it affordable. \n\nAnd I think it's kind of hilarious that OP actually likes how Rosie did part of her wedding, to the point she's going to mimic it if she has a wedding of her own, but it's also talking down about the wedding.\n\nI'm getting strong Rosie is the black sheep of the family vibes, because even when she does something right the spotlight is stolen and her effort is completely dismissed.", "YTA  \nThat's the part that gets me, doing it infront of everyone in the middle of the event. Ya could have easilly found a corner alone for a moment or just waited until everyone was getting ready to leave. What they don't get is that it's not the proposel itself that's the issue it's how it takes eyes off the bride and groom and can taint the memory of the event. This isn't just some birthday, it's a hopefully only once in a lifetime event. There were so many ways to handle this where everyone would have been happy. You only do proposals in front of everyone at that kind of event if the people getting married give you the OK.", "> He said he was mesmerized by her when they were dancing and decided it was the time.\n\nHe\u2019s also a liar.

GTFOH with that BS! \n\nHe knew he intended to do it, the fiance-girlfriend knew(no way she'd have instantly demanded portraits unless she'd planned to look her best, there's a reason that everyone looks wild in wedding receptionphotos), the sister knew, the BIL knew.
