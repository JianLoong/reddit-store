{"id": 17173, "submission_id": "13gx56z", "title": "AITA for defending my brother after he proposed to her girlfriend at my sister's reception?", "selftext": "Last Saturday my sister Rosie got married. It was a simple ceremony in the courtyard outside the hall and then some dinner, drinks and dancing. Rosie and her husband Billy wanted to keep it under \u00a37000 and they spent most of it on the dinner and reception for the guests. They had the actual wedding when the sun was setting and did the photos before the ceremony instead of afterwards. Which I thought was a good idea and will follow suit if I ever get married. \n\nAfter the dinner during the reception my brother Danny proposed to his girlfriend Jamie. He said he was mesmerized by her when they were dancing and decided it was the time. Rosie is angry at Danny for doing it at her reception in front of her guests. Now Danny has been with Jamie for almost 3 years. Me and Rosie among others knew Danny had been talking about proposing. He had bought a ring a few days before. Rosie's only objection was that he did it at the reception.\n\nRosie and Danny purposely did not have a large wedding on purpose. They didn't have a lot of the normal wedding things. They had it night so they didn't keep their guests all day. Even for the honeymoon they only went to Aberystwyth, and spent two nights there. They drove back home Monday morning.\n\nIt's out of character for Rosie (and Billy) to be upset about other people getting attention or not getting attention. They had a small wedding on purpose. Rosie is angry at Danny and at me for defending him. She already had her photos and ceremony and the reception was half over. Had Danny done it at the ceremony or if Rosie had a big wedding and wanted more attention I would think differently.\n\nAm I TA for defending Danny? I'm not married but if I was getting married I would have been excited and happy for Danny and Jamie. I did think Jamie asking the photographer to take engagement portraits was slightly rude. But I can't blame her that much because she was so excited. Is it really that big of a deal? I don't feel like it's a problem and I think Rosie and Billy and others who are angry at Danny are overreacting. I'm surprised because this is out of character for Rosie to get upset about something like this. I think we should be happy for Danny and Jamie. Their engagement is a good thing.

So, that means what...that because it's smaller, it's not as important?  YTA.  Your brother is definitely the asshole for doing it at her reception (and also is apparently an idiot who has been living under a rock, if he didn't know that it's EXTREMELY poor etiquette to propose at someone else's wedding).  And you're the asshole for defending him.", "YTA. It is NEVER acceptable to hijack someone else's event. Your sister may have wanted a small, low-key wedding, but she wanted the focus of the entire event to be her and her new husband. \n\nDanny could have proposed privately if he was so \"mesmerized\" by Jamie's dancing and then announced said engagement at a later time. \n\nYou owe your sister and her husband an apology. Danny and Jamie owe your sister and her husband a PUBLIC acknowledgment of their rudeness and an apology for it and a private offer to reimburse your sister and her husband for the reception they usurped and the photographer Jamie horned in on.", "YTA- someone else\u2019s hard worked for event is not the time nor place to take over. And hijacking the photographer? Holy hell. Y\u2019all all owe the bride and groom a huge apology.", "Regardless of how big or how small the wedding was, it was your sister's moment and wedding and your oaf of a brother stomped all over it. \n\nYou and he are both collosal assholes. \n\nYTA and he's the asshole.   I cannot believe you are defending him when he used his sister's dime to take engagement photos.  I hope your sister burns them instead of giving them to him.", "You keep saying your sister purposefully had a small wedding, as if that has any relevance at all. It's very rude to steal the spotlight at someone else's celebration, regardless of size. YTA.", "YTA\n\nAnd Danny is also AH. No matter the size/type of the event, a wedding is about the the two people getting married. It is their event, their time, their rules. Proposing during their event without asking for permission beforehand is incredibly rude and inappropriate.", "YTA. It doesn't matter how you'd react to this if it happened to you. It was Rosie's day and your brother interfered. Try and see it from her perspective and not your own.", "YTA, as are Danny and Jamie.  Do any of you have any sense of manners whatsoever?  I guess it really would have killed Danny (and Jamie) to let someone else have the spotlight for one day.", "YTA\n\nOnly bc you don't recognize that proper protocol in these situations is to ask the bride and groom beforehand. It's fine if he got caught up in the moment, but he could have stepped aside and asked them first. They aren't upset that they are engaged, but that they didn't even ask and did it at their small wedding. Maybe their wedding was small because that's all they could afford or they are saving for something else. But either way it was their day and they deserves to be alerted first.", "YTA.. Wedding Days are to celebrate the Bride and Groom. It's massively disrespectful to them for someone else to propose at a wedding without any warning and you've defended this behavior, which is just as disrespectful.\n\nNo wonder the Bride is ticked.", "YTA -  You are the a-hole. There are 231+ other days to conduct a proposal in 2023. Never at a wedding. Why couldn't the 3 of 'you be happy' for Rosie and hubby for 24 hours by not interrupting their marriage day with selfishness?!\n\nYou're demeaning when describing their wedding. Is was 'less than' so it was 'ok' for a proposal to occur?! How incredibly hurtful to the bride, groom and parents (who had one day to witness their child marry). Stop justifying your defense of their thoughtless act.", "YTA. You're neither Rosie nor Billy.", "YTA.  It's never ok to hijack someone else's event no matter how big or small it is.  Then they pulled the photographer that they didn't even pay for, for engagement pictures? That's so trashy. \n\nIt also doesn't matter how you would have felt because it's not about you. None of this is about you, so why did you have to stick your nose in it?

Instead of being happy for his sister and her new husband and celebrating that, he made it all about himself.", "YTA. \n\nDanny is t a h.  \n\nYou all suck.", "YTA. Everyone except bride and groom. Asking for engagement pictures at the wedding? That\u2019s the tackiest thing I\u2019ve ever read and you are defending it.", "YTA, and your brother is.  There are four cardinal rules for wedding guests:\n\n* Do not wear white.  \n* Do not steal the gifts.  \n* Do not bring kids if they're not invited.\n* ***Do not propose at someone else's wedding***  \n\nThe only exception for any of these if the bride AND groom, in person, and without any duress, give both permission and blessing.  \n\nThey obviously did not.\n\nWhy don't you go and have a birthday party, and let someone else hijack it for their graduation or promotion?  \n\nY'all TAs.", "Yta. Your bro basically commandeered a party that he did not plan or pay for that was to honour your sisters wedding and turned it into his own free engagement party. It doesnt matter how small or inexpensive the wedding was. It was your sis wedding.That was selfish,classless and tacky of your bro. Basic etiquette and manners you never ever propose announce an engagement or pregnancy at someone elses event unless you specifically get their permission. And him asking the wedding photographer to take some engagement photos wasn't \"slightly rude\" it was presumptuous and arrogant. The photog was there to take photos of her wedding.\nYou don't get a vote or opinion on how she should share her day just because you think you would be happy on your hypothetical day. Your brother was 1000% in the wrong and you are too", "Well, Danny and Jamie were the huge assholes here, but yes, a very big YTA for standing up for him.\n\nDanny could have waited until after the wedding ceremony was over. It's horribly, ridiculously rude to propose at a wedding, and there really is zero excuse for it.", "You and your brother are the AH. You should never make someone else event your event - unless you have permission. The fact that your brother purchase the ring just days before the wedding and made his sister wedding about him and not her happiness is rude. Also, his fiance asking the photographer to take engagement pictures is very tacky. He hijacked an event to save money and planning. The fact that it was a small party is more disgusting because his proposal was seen by the full  party and took attention from the bride and groom.\n\nHe should apologize to your sister and pay for the photographer. If he doesn't, he doesn't care about his sister. You should also apologize. I hope your sister holds their pictures hostage until they apologize.", "You and Danny are As. I had a very similar wedding to your sister's because my partner and I didn't think a one-time party was worth throwing away a ton of money (think about spending 7,000 euro on one party). We also wanted the day to be about us and our love, not about the flowers or the cake or the venue or whatever. Your brother took that away from them. It was no longer about them and a celebration of their love, but about a celebration of your brother and his girlfriend. Some people are fine with engagements at their wedding, but honestly, most are not. He should have asked first. And he can't say he got caught up in the moment if he brought the ring with him to the wedding - sounds planned to me.", "YTA \nDanny was wrong. Period. And you trying to defend him is wrong too.", "YTA. As someone else said it is never ok to highjack someone\u2019s wedding to propose. Whether it\u2019s a big wedding or a small intimate affair. In fact I\u2019d say that it being small makes it even worse because it\u2019s even more obvious and even more the center of attention. And yeah how did she have the gall to ask thorium sister\u2019s wedding photographer to take engagement pictures? Honestly?!", "YTA and so is your brother. It was your sister's special day and your brother took the attention away from the couple, and his girlfriend hijacked the photographer for engagement photos. In what universe is that OK? The size of the celebration is irrelevant.", "The first rule of weddings is don't upstage the bride. Your brother is an AH and YTA too if you defend him. If he doesn't apologize he shouldn't be surprised when sis shows up at his wedding wearing white.", "YTA. You should never propose at a wedding unless you have permission from the bride and groom first. What your brother did was the epitome of trash. He used your sister's party so he didn't have to plan or pay for anything on his own. It's disgusting and you're disgusting for supporting him.", "YTA\n\nIt is tacky to make someone else's event about you. It was your sister's wedding. The event was about then and the focus should've stayed on them. your brother could've waited till after to ask his gf out asked  the couple beforehand if they'd be ok with him proposing. He did neither and that's kinda rude. You should've stayed out of it or acknowledged general etiquette would make Danny the ah", "There is literally zero question, YTA, but your attention seeking brother is a bigger ah. There is no way he didn\u2019t have this planned, and hitch makes it worse. Also for the balls of the gf to grab the photographer to get pictures taken. Honestly the more I type, the more positive I am the they would be cut out of my life.", "YTA\u2014 it was your sister\u2019s wedding.. small or not, your brother should absolutely not have proposed. Your sister already said to NOT do it at her reception and he did it anyways.. \n\nAnd Jamie asking the photographer to take photos when Rosie was paying that photographer?! Rude is an understatement", "You spend multiple sentences going out of your way to denigrate your sister's wedding - as if it's less valid because it's less traditional, so totally fine for your brother to take a day about them and instead make it about himself. \n\n>I did think Jamie asking the photographer to take engagement portraits was slightly rude. \n\nYou're fucking joking right? I actually hope you're a troll because otherwise the level of obtuse is really sad. ESH except your poor sister.", "YTA -- not your wedding, not your reception to be upset about. Rosie and Billy get this once in their lives, and they deserve to have it go as they want. If they're upset, they are valid to be upset\n\nGod, what I would GIVE to have the confidence of a mediocre man to be like, \"I can decide how everyone should feel about the consequences of my actions\"", "YTA for defending outrageous behavior by your brother.  It was selfish and inconsiderate for Danny to propose at someone else's wedding.  The size and organization of the wedding is completely irrelevant.

Your brothers behaviour is outrageous and you are TA for defending his nonsense", "YTA...We also just had a small wedding under $10,000 canadian and we're weird about being the center of attention, but I would have physically fought someone who did this.

Not your wedding, not your right to defend or forgive.", "YTA \u2014 well more specifically your brother but you aren\u2019t much better for defending him. \nYou never upstage the bride, no matter how simple the wedding is.", "YTA\n\nAnyone proposing at another's  wedding without their permission are all AH.", "A wedding is about celebrating the couple that has just been married.\n\nAny major announcements on someone else\u2019s celebration is inappropriate. \n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nDid Danny pay half the cost of the reception so it could also be used for his engagement? Did he pay half the cost of the photographer? \n\nAnd even if those were answered as yes its still rude as fuck\n\nYou are entitled as hell, as is your brother.  \n\nA small intimate wedding is romantic as hell and is the last place you should propose unless the bride and groom give permission \n\n\nAlso you sound like a green eyed monster that no one wants to marry you.

It was a simple ceremony in the courtyard outside the hall and then some dinner, drinks and dancing. Rosie and her husband Billy wanted to keep it under \u00a37000 and they spent most of it on the dinner and reception for the guests. They had the actual wedding when the sun was setting and did the photos before the ceremony instead of afterwards. Which I thought was a good idea and will follow suit if I ever get married. \n\nAfter the dinner during the reception my brother Danny proposed to his girlfriend Jamie. He said he was mesmerized by her when they were dancing and decided it was the time. Rosie is angry at Danny for doing it at her reception in front of her guests. Now Danny has been with Jamie for almost 3 years. Me and Rosie among others knew Danny had been talking about proposing. He had bought a ring a few days before. Rosie's only objection was that he did it at the reception.\n\nRosie and Danny purposely did not have a large wedding on purpose. They didn't have a lot of the normal wedding things. They had it night so they didn't keep their guests all day. Even for the honeymoon they only went to Aberystwyth, and spent two nights there. They drove back home Monday morning.\n\nIt's out of character for Rosie (and Billy) to be upset about other people getting attention or not getting attention. They had a small wedding on purpose. Rosie is angry at Danny and at me for defending him. She already had her photos and ceremony and the reception was half over. Had Danny done it at the ceremony or if Rosie had a big wedding and wanted more attention I would think differently.\n\nAm I TA for defending Danny? I'm not married but if I was getting married I would have been excited and happy for Danny and Jamie. I did think Jamie asking the photographer to take engagement portraits was slightly rude. But I can't blame her that much because she was so excited. Is it really that big of a deal? I don't feel like it's a problem and I think Rosie and Billy and others who are angry at Danny are overreacting. I'm surprised because this is out of character for Rosie to get upset about something like this. I think we should be happy for Danny and Jamie. Their engagement is a good thing.

I explained my opinion further in another comment.", "$7000 engagement pictures", "Jealous of their financial success, I think.", "Unfortunately, this is way too common. \n\nMy friend's wife is a wedding photographer. One time, the best man came up to her and tried to ask her to make sure she got photos of them getting engaged. She told both the DJ and the Bride (who was 100% not on board and barely tolerated the best man). When he tried to go for it (during the best man speech, nonetheless), the DJ cut his mic and started blasting music.", "I like the way you think.", "No, \u201cy\u2019all\u201d would not be okay with that. It\u2019s never okay to hijack someone else\u2019s event with your own. \n\nWhere did you read that everyone had already left? The reception was only half over. What Jamie did was extremely tacky, she and Danny are perfect for each other.", "The photographer was paid for by the couple getting married and the reception was not over - the photog still being there meant they were photographing the party. I don\u2019t care if she was excited, she became an asshole the second she asked for those pics. Danny may have put her in the position, but she grabbed that baton and fuckin ran with it. If she wants engagement photos, she can book and pay for her own photographer.\n\nThis was wildly inappropriate, start to finish. The fact the photographer agreed to do those photos is also mind boggling to me.", "Just because a photographer may not be pointing their camera at something at that moment, doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t still working. There\u2019s a lot of thinking and attention that needs to be done to figure out what good shots are.\n\nBtw from what I\u2019ve seen on this sub, we would be firmly N T A to a bride refusing to allow others to demand special pictures from their wedding photographer.", "You honestly believe that Jamie is not at fault for demanding engagement photos at someone else\u2019s wedding on someone else\u2019s dime? Remind me to never invite you to any important events.", "During the best man speech?! My man was crazy if he thought that was okay.", "I interpreted it as people having left being an indicator of it being half over and not a literal amount of time. Which is usually how receptions go, only family and close friends stay latest.", "I think you are sarcastic so I will leave it at that but respond with an updated opinion anyways because I can. If she asked for a photo shoot, definitely tacky. Dragging mom and dad over for a group photo? Tacky. Ten photos or less? Of the event, couple, ring, and maybe one intentionally with the bride and groom? Acceptable.", "I think we are splitting hairs on how much was going on at the reception at this time. If she dragged the photographer across the venue then yes, Jamie sucks. I am assuming photographer was nearby and relatively available, and perhaps the venue was emptying out.", "Demanding is a stretch to me. I honestly believe as someone who photographed events for fun, it\u2019s not a big deal. The photos are obviously not the issue.", "Definitely a worst man not a best one.", "Absolutely no part of my comment was sarcastic.\n\nNo number of photos was acceptable. Zero. It was not her event and she was not paying for the photographer.", "Even if he was sitting down doing SFA, this photographer was not available. They were there because they had been hired by Rosie and Billy. They are not to be grabbed by others. And if they were truly done photographing the wedding, they would have already put their equipment safely away.\n\nIt is rude AF to be at someone\u2019s small intimate wedding celebration and start piggybacking your own stuff.", "Ok well then I will respond seriously because why not. I own a DSLR camera and through high school and for years afterwards enjoy offering nice photos to my friends (for example, in high school I photographed them playing sports and gave all of them to the players including the ones I used in the yearbook). These kinds of photographs with this caliber of camera is so special to me that the level of assholery of the person saying no don\u2019t use it (presuming  they aren\u2019t doing much at the time) greatly exceeds the level of selfishness of asking for a few photos. My uncle is a professional photographer and I LOVE his photos of family events. I would never expect it for free but if he were around with his camera I would think because he loves me he would snap some and he often ends up as do I, as a backup wedding photographer (we pull groups of known people together such as three besties from elementary school or mom, grandma, kid) while the actual photographer gets dancing photos or eats etc. Usually in my case, the photographer dips early actually because they are only there 2-4 hours, so more than once I and my family have stepped up and are doing our best exit photos totally unexpected by the couple just because I value photos so much. In a perfect world they have their own photographer- but they didn\u2019t. Jamie is just likely NTA and she had no control over this and isn\u2019t being unreasonable in my opinion.", "So\u2026you\u2019re fixated on the nice camera that was around and figure sure, why the hell not? Your story is irrelevant because you don\u2019t indicate anywhere that you\u2019re shoehorning someone else\u2019s impromptu event into the primary one.\n\nYou keep saying stuff about the camera not being used for much but *it was.* It was being used to photograph a wedding reception. The photographer was not standing around doing nothing. \nIn a perfect world, they\u2019d have their own photographer. *So they should have booked one and done a separate shoot.* Engagement portraits don\u2019t have to happen at the time of the engagement. And since it was Jamie that asked for the photos, the question had already been popped so it\u2019s not like they were capturing an irreplaceable moment.\n\nI paid several thousand dollars to my wedding photographer. If something like this had happened, I\u2019d be telling the photographer that they needed to discount my rate and bill my brother and FSIL if they wanted to see their photos.\n\nIt\u2019s nice that you value photos so much but that has absolutely nothing to do with the situation here.", "Are you serious? I would never. Reasonable to bill Danny and he probably should throw a few bucks their way for it. I would because I agree it is a major expense and I keep seething over her getting photos back and having to see them as part of HER day. But to ask the photographer for a discount is insane. I would say $200 is reasonable regardless of package price. $300 and people will say that\u2019s a lot of money when they were already there anyways, $100 and people will say that\u2019s all their worth? They are really paying for the editing of the photos more than anything which will be like you know, $20-$50 per photo and it\u2019s likely just a preset photoshop thing. And Danny has ZERO comments on quality of photos. He says thank you for what he gets."]}
