She has always had a lot of insecurities and rarely ever says anything positive about her own body. She constantly compares herself to others online and in real life. She feels bad about her appearance for almost the entire day about 4-7 times a week. It's very common for us to be watching a movie/TV show where an attractive woman (with some feature that my GF feels she lacks) will appear. After the movie/episode is over, she will then feel horrible for the rest of the day about why that feature doesn't \"look as good\" on her.\n\nI have ALWAYS been very supportive and genuinely compliment her appearance multiple times, DAILY.  She is very beautiful and has a great body, that I ALWAYS make sure to appreciate. I spent our first year together only seeing her on most weekends when I was in the army training for a year. On average I got about 4-5 hours of sleep every night because I would stay up late texting with her and comforting her about her insecurities when I could've been sleeping 8+ hours. Maybe I'm dumb, young, and naive, but I truly believed after all of these years that me always showing her that I find her absolutely stunning would help her get through her insecurities, at least a bit, but nothing has changed..\n\nIn the past few months I've been very stressed with everything going on in life and I haven't had the time or energy to sit for hours and comfort her when she feels down about an insecurity. I don't show my stress on the outside and always try to keep a positive attitude when others are around. I've gotten to the point where I'm so incredibly fed up with the CONSTANT complaining about her insecurities that it causes me a lot of stress to have to deal with such negativity almost daily. If I'm having a really good day and feel great, there's about a 30% chance that I'll come home to super negative complaining, and it really bums me out. To give you an idea, she sometimes complains about shit that I have NEVER noticed, such as \"one eyebrow is lower than the other\", or \"one of my butt cheeks is smaller than the other\". \n\nNow on to what happened today. I got home from work in a great mood and started talking to her about some funny stuff that happened. After I was done telling her the funny stuff, she started showing me comparison photos that she took of herself. She was complaining about something that I have never ever noticed in 4 years of being together, trying to convince me that there was something wrong with her, and I got really annoyed. I raised my voice a little and told her something along the lines of \"stop giving a shit about childish stuff like this! Nobody notices this stuff, not even I do and I see your body basically every day! Use common sense!\" She left the room and started crying.. Now she won't even speak to me. \n\nI feel bad about making her upset, I just can't handle the negativity anymore.

You\u2019re her boyfriend, you can be supportive (as you have been) but you can\u2019t treat underlying issues. \n\nAnd you have a right to step away when her issues are starting to affect your own mental health.

I'm sorry to say that but your relationship is very unhealthy.", "NTA. As others have said, she needs professional help if she\u2019s taking photos to compare, it is really unhealthy. \n\nWhile supporting your gf is important, it sounds also that she\u2019s feeding on the validation you give her (if your usual comments are like \u201coh, that\u2019s not true, you\u2019re perfect, I love you just the way you are, etc\u201d); but it\u2019s never enough because she will always need more from you and that is not fair. \n\nI think you can have a conversation that goes along the lines \u201cI\u2019m sorry that my outburst happened like that, but I don\u2019t want to hear you go on about this topic anymore. I love you and I think you\u2019re perfect just the way you are, and I can see and tell you this every day; but I don\u2019t want to discuss what you see as imperfections.

If you can suggest or support her in getting to therapy that\u2019d be great.", "NTA - There's only so much you can do. It sounds like she needs therapy. It's not fair to you at all. \nIt doesn't even seem like she paid any attention to whatever you shared with her. She just jumped right into complaining about whatever insecurity was bothering her at that moment. None of this is healthy, for either of you.", "NTA, Jesus Christ that sounds exhausting \n\nIf I were you I would apologise for making her cry but you can no longer take part in her self-harming and you will no longer partake in these conversations about her comparing herself to others", "NTA You weren't even that harsh. This girl needs professional help. Period. Full stop. If you truly care about her, then you need to force the issue with the help of her family, if need be. She honestly sounds like a time bomb for self harm.\n\nIf you're emotionally done though, run now. 4 years is enough wasted time at your ages to be running in a circles already.", "I think you could have worded what you said to her a lot better, but you're NTA. Now, I'm no doctor, but I have body dysmorphia and have suffered with it for a very long time, and everything you have described sounds incredibly similar to my own experiences. She needs to talk to a professional as this seems to be a lot deeper than just 'normal' insecurities. I hope she can learn to accept and trust that you see her as beautiful. It's not easy feeling like all your words of encouragement are just going through one ear and out the other. Unfortunately, insecurities at that level can eat away at you and control your life, and it feels impossible to see yourself the same way your loved ones do, so it might take a long time to improve. I hope she can get the help she needs.\n\nDon't forget that your mental health is also important too and we can't always be there for someone.  You need to take care of yourself as well", "ESH, (I have clarified below what I mean by this because I don\u2019t think this is a fault situation either way).\n\n I can completely understand why you had the response you did, I actually think you sound like a very empathetic person.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been hugely supportive over the years, but I think the kind of help she needs is beyond your scope as a partner.\n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s got body dysmorphia and she most definitely needs to see a therapist about that.\n\nYou need to sit down with her and explain that it\u2019s having an impact on your relationship and on your well-being as well, and you understand that that\u2019s genuinely how she feels about her body, but it doesn\u2019t tally with the reality of her body.\n\nI find it really difficult to say that everyone sucks because clearly she\u2019s not well and she\u2019s not intending to have this impact on you and you have been dealing with this for years on end to your own detriment and had a moment of just snapping. The only thing that you even need to be slightly sorry for is that. But I feel it will be perfectly reasonable to say I\u2019m sorry I snapped this is the reason why.\n\nI hope you get this sorted out soon because it does sound really difficult.", "YTA.\n\nYou slipped up and did something that was very hurtful to your gf and you had no other intention, than to shut her up with a hurtful comment.

Nothing will change, if you don't articulate your feelings, needs and wants. A relationship can be so incredibly beautiful, if both of you talk and listen to each other and both of you put effort into making each others lives better and easier.\n\nApart from that your gf behavior sounds like she needs some professional help. This is NOT normal behavior by any means.", "NTA. I'm exhausted on your behalf just reading how much time and energy you spend trying to alleviate her insecurities. This is not normal behavior, and it's not fair to dump it on you. I think your girlfriend needs a wake-up call. Either she finds some other way to manage her insecurities, like a therapist, or you should jump ship.", "AH\n\nYou need to keep your cool when dealing with an SO's emotional triggers. Losing it is unacceptable, particularly if you were in a good mood before/your patience wasn't obviously fraying. Be patient with her.", "Overall NTA though you could have handled it better.

I tend to bottle up my emotions a lot, but I'll try to really tell her how it makes me feel. \n\nI've suspected for a while that it must sadly be body dysmorphia, which I understand can't be treated in any other way other than professionally (if I'm not mistaken).", "This.

Nobody is 100% perfect all of the time.\n\nI'd also tell her that your reaction was not ideal, but that she needs to take your needs and feelings into account as well. At the moment it looks like as if the relationship is pretty one-sided when it comes to supporting the other. She needs to see that she also needs to put in effort when she wants your relationship to last, so making sure that she has a place to dump her feelings, but also to learn and grow, should be high on her list.\n\nIf therapy is too expensive there are a lot of ways to get started: there's literature, self-help groups, videos on body dysmorphia, etc etc.\n\nBut she needs to understand first that this is necessary for herself and for your relationship, if she thinks it's just a \"you\"-thing it won't work.", "Ive only recently started getting therapy for it as in the past other therapists I had didn't know how to help me.
