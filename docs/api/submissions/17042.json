She has always had a lot of insecurities and rarely ever says anything positive about her own body. She constantly compares herself to others online and in real life. She feels bad about her appearance for almost the entire day about 4-7 times a week. It's very common for us to be watching a movie/TV show where an attractive woman (with some feature that my GF feels she lacks) will appear. After the movie/episode is over, she will then feel horrible for the rest of the day about why that feature doesn't \"look as good\" on her.\n\nI have ALWAYS been very supportive and genuinely compliment her appearance multiple times, DAILY.  She is very beautiful and has a great body, that I ALWAYS make sure to appreciate. I spent our first year together only seeing her on most weekends when I was in the army training for a year. On average I got about 4-5 hours of sleep every night because I would stay up late texting with her and comforting her about her insecurities when I could've been sleeping 8+ hours. Maybe I'm dumb, young, and naive, but I truly believed after all of these years that me always showing her that I find her absolutely stunning would help her get through her insecurities, at least a bit, but nothing has changed..\n\nIn the past few months I've been very stressed with everything going on in life and I haven't had the time or energy to sit for hours and comfort her when she feels down about an insecurity. I don't show my stress on the outside and always try to keep a positive attitude when others are around. I've gotten to the point where I'm so incredibly fed up with the CONSTANT complaining about her insecurities that it causes me a lot of stress to have to deal with such negativity almost daily. If I'm having a really good day and feel great, there's about a 30% chance that I'll come home to super negative complaining, and it really bums me out. To give you an idea, she sometimes complains about shit that I have NEVER noticed, such as \"one eyebrow is lower than the other\", or \"one of my butt cheeks is smaller than the other\". \n\nNow on to what happened today. I got home from work in a great mood and started talking to her about some funny stuff that happened. After I was done telling her the funny stuff, she started showing me comparison photos that she took of herself. She was complaining about something that I have never ever noticed in 4 years of being together, trying to convince me that there was something wrong with her, and I got really annoyed. I raised my voice a little and told her something along the lines of \"stop giving a shit about childish stuff like this! Nobody notices this stuff, not even I do and I see your body basically every day! Use common sense!\" She left the room and started crying.. Now she won't even speak to me. \n\nI feel bad about making her upset, I just can't handle the negativity anymore.

It's not easy feeling like all your words of encouragement are just going through one ear and out the other. Unfortunately, insecurities at that level can eat away at you and control your life, and it feels impossible to see yourself the same way your loved ones do, so it might take a long time to improve.

This can be used in therapy later, to see how it influences mood, to confront yourself with how much time you invest in this behaviour and develop coping mechanisms. Like for example reducing it step by step by first designating one time a week she is allowed to do it for 10min, then reducing further, modifying your reaction to triggers etc.\n\nEdit: NTA your reaction was completely normal, especially if the problem has already been discussed.

She does have some growing up to do, but the phrase \"use common sense\" is \\*deeply\\* patronizing, and if there's something you can't handle your options are to be compassionate while helping her get past it, or to break up, not to be needlessly mean.", "NTA.  This sounds absolutely exhausting to deal with.  She needs professional help.", " She needs some therapy most likely. NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe should talk to a mental health professional, she may have something going on. I am not a doctor or a therapist but it sounds a lot like how I've heard people describe body dysmorphia.", "NTA, it is draining dealing with someone who needs constant reassurance and it does nothing for your morale. 4 Years is alot  and its a exhausting to have to put up with that.  I hope she gets help soon or this relationship is not going to last because you will burn yourself out and resent her for wasting all those years on things so petty.", "> This. I understand that OP interprets his actions as \"supportive\" but what he is doing is basically invalidating his gf's emotions, which is not helpful, and only perpetuates the cycle.\n\nIt doesn't sound like OP thinks this response was \"supportive\" at all. It sounds like he is supportive *in general*, but this one time was so frustrated with his GF's insecurities that he snapped at her.", "Most of the top models have had at least one thing \u201coff\u201d (as in what your gf would consider imperfect) about them. Think tooth gaps, moles, big foreheads, huge eyes. It\u2019s what makes them look special and stand out from other models. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t really about your gfs looks. And she\u2019s not lacking external validation from you. This is internal and requires a professional to work through. Or some really diligent self help. \n\nI understand your frustration, but you can\u2019t help her with this. I would apologize for being abrupt and harsh. But explain to her that you are upset bc you don\u2019t know how to help her. That hyperfixation is not healthy and that all you want is for her to be healthy mentally and physically and gently suggest seeking help. \n\nHonestly, it would probably be better for this girl to be alone and work on her self esteem for awhile rather than letting her issues sour the relationship you already have. You are already in the beginning stages of resentment. Try not to let it fester. \n\nGl", ">\"I know but I wish I was perfect.\"\n\nNothing you can ever do will help as long as she thinks this.

I was a college athlete and I knew too many girls that had a lot of body dysmorphia. A good friend of mine had it and even though she was very fit and skinny no matter how much anyone insisted that she wasn\u2019t fat she took it as people being nice to her so she wouldn\u2019t feel bad about being fat. So it was a really difficult situation where being supportive seemed to do the opposite of help.\nThankfully she eventually overcame it but it was a big moment for her.", "NTA - she needs to get professional help, she might be going through body dysmorphia (not an excuse) and just not able to process any of these things on her own so she relies on you. you seem super supportive, i recommend therapy.", "NTA but I think your girlfriend is making you miserable, you should reconsider the relationship. Being insecure is not her fault, but it is her responsability to manage it. You sacrificed a good chunk of necessary hours of sleep, I find her quite selfish for allowing this to happen.", "NTA. You snapped. You are stressed out too. She needs to stop using you for emotional validation as it\u2019s exhausting. She should try seeing a therapist. Maybe try suggesting it to her?", "NTA but you kind of set the bar for years of listening to her terrible behaviour. Expectations create an interest and your story makes it sound like you enabled this awful behaviour for years.", "NTA, but you were naive to think that constantly showering her with praise would make any difference. I was a lot like your gf at 16 yo and I struggled with anorexia for a long time (I still do but nowhere near as bad as then). Nothing anybody said ever made a difference. The only thing that ever made a dent was a lot of therapy and really accepting myself as I am.", "NTA please talk with her about therapy, this mindset can be dangerous resulting in starving or overeating, self harm, and other dangerous behavior.", "NTA. It is really, really hard for her, but it is is also her responsibility to deal with this. Unfortunately it sounds like y'all need a come to Jesus moment. You need to tell her that she either starts anxiety meds and talking to a therapist or you're done. This isn't sustainable for either of you.", "NTA except to yourself. You are giving up time to do anything else, including sleep, in order to spend all your time comforting your girlfriend. You are permitting her to constantly ruin your mood.\n \nShe\u2019s become addicted to being soothed by you.\n\nYou need to have a talk with her.

You can not fix this, and it should never be your job to do so.", "NTA.\n\nUnfortunately, your gf is an emotional black hole for you and is an energy vampire. It's a wonder that your relationship has survived this long, honestly.\n\nWere you perhaps slightly harsh in your delivery? Maybe. But after four years of constant reassurance and daily encouragement, it's no wonder that you are emotionally spent. \n\nIf you want this relationship to continue, it's time to have a conversation with your gf that she needs help that you can't give her. She needs intense therapy because it seems that she has some deep seated body image issues. Whatever the cause of the issues, this is something that a licensed therapist needs to address. If she refuses to seek treatment, then you're going to have to reevaluate whether you can continue to be her emotional dumping ground.", "NTA.

I have really bad anxiety, like, didn't eat in public for years because \"eating confirms I'm a fat pig and I can't let people know I'm a fat pig on the inside AND outside\" anxiety. One of my \"core beliefs\" my therapist calls it, is just that I am shit and I will never be anything but shit do insert shitty thoughts here. It's something that feels so true and natural to me that I've built my whole life around the concept. \n\nIt's REALLY hard to unlearn, and unfortunately, there's really nothing you can personally do to help her except encourage her to get therapy. And please do start making boundaries. Again, as someone who can relate to her, it's not fair to ask you to comfort her for hours or walk on egg shells or anything like that. Your feelings and mental health and life and experiences matter, too.", "> I raised my voice a little and told her something along the lines of \"stop giving a shit about childish stuff like this! Nobody notices this stuff, not even I do and I see your body basically every day! Use common sense!\"\n\nYTA.  Insulting and shaming her is being an AH.  It's also incorrect as this behavior isn't \"childish\" or lacking in common sense.  Our society is set up to shame women for how they look and it takes a lot of strength to fight against it.  \n\nYou wrote out this long post about how it's been affecting you *for years* and at no point do you mention having an actual conversation with her about it.  You need to learn to communicate better instead of waiting until you blow up.  \n\nLook.  I get that the complaining and having to comfort her all the time is exhausting.  However, you can't fix your GF by complimenting her.  Insulting and shaming her is likely going to make it even worse.  She needs professional help.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with you. She needs therapy. No one should spend so much time and energy on this pursuit. She needs to move on from this.\n\nYou could also start shutting her down. Tell her that this is not healthy.

I understand why OP *thinks* that him \"always showing her that I find her absolutely stunning would help her get through her insecurities\", but this does not work like that because his girlfriend's problem is not *his* opinion, but her own. By him directing the discussion towards his own perspective he is not listening to his girlfriend, and that is not helpful at all. \n\nI understand it is hard to listen to people who are so obviously misguided or suffer from issues that don't seem real. But I'm pretty sure these issues are very *very* real for OPs girlfriend, and her own perspective is not being heard here, and her emotions are not being validated.", "I just wanted to say good for you in the way you've taken the feedback.  It speaks volumes about how much you care for her.   Don't feel bad it's got to this point.   It was a natural assumption to think she just lacked confidence and was insecure and trying to say positive things and it can be hard to recognize that it's more than that and that her internal filter may be taking that positivity and using it against herself (our heads can be weird, it's like telling someone with depression that they are fun to be around, it can be turned around in your head to 'if only you knew what I was really like').\n\nOne of the differences between a behavior and a disorder is if it is maladaptive and causes distress and dysfunction in normal life.  Unfortunately, your partner is well into this territory as it is a major factor in her day-to-day life and it really does need professional help for both of your sakes.   I am sure from everything you've said that you will support her and make any adaptations they suggest as part of her treatment if they give advice on how areas around this are discussed between you. \n\nDon't feel bad about having a bad reaction in one moment, you've been under a lot of strain and trying to carry it on your shoulders.  Hopefully, this moment will be the thing that brings it into the light and shows that you both can't keep going on day by day doing the same thing but that this needs very specific support to get better.  I wish you both the best.", "On the one hand I see your point, but on the other hand, his own opinion is all he really has to give. He can't fix what's going on in her head.\n\nI think, since she keeps coming to him for support and they talk about this for hours, that his compliments do provide some relief in the moment. But since it doesn't fix the underlying issue, she keeps needing constant reassurance.", "You are NTA.  When I met my wife she was the same way.  And now we have been together 20 years and she is still the same way.  What happened is that her career became the most important thing, and then we had kids and they became the most important thing.  But her self image is still a burden.  My take is you are even more supportive than I have been.  But, in my personal experience your gf needs professional help, the sooner the better.  My wife finally found a good fit with a therapist a little over a year ago and it is helping a lot, but man is it a journey.  That\u2019s why your gf should start looking now, just finding the right person to help can take years, let alone the work that needs to happen after finding the right person.  Hope for her sake you are in it for the long haul.  If not, get out now.  That toll on your mental health will not be insignificant", "Nta but you need to just break up with her. A relationship is about balance and pulling each other up. She only brings you down.

She needs to be whole before you can ever meet her needs in a relationship.  If she is broken inside, she will exhaust you as you pour into her all day every day because she will never fill up.  You are fooling yourself if you think you can fix this.  She needs therapy and you probably need time apart until she handles her issues.  She WILL take you down into her depression with her, and she should not be in a relationship until she is mentally healthy.", "NTA but for me I couldn't be with someone this insecure  it would drive me nuts trying to constantly tell someone and give them compliments and nothing is going through. The worst part is that constant negativity would just depress me and bring me down. She needs thearpy ASAP because if she doesn't get it she will drag you down with her that may sound harsh but for me I am normally always happy so when someone feels like this all the time I would just want to get out", "NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend sounds like she's suffering from a severe case of body dysmorphia, and needs professional help. The fact that she's been like this for years and neither of you have concluded that she needs therapy is honestly mind-boggling.\n\nIf you wanna be with her, help her find psychiatric help stat, because no amount of love or compliments is gonna fix this.

Your girlfriend sounds like she has body dismorphia, which means she sees and fixates on bodily imperfections that may or may not actually exist. And it sounds really severe. She desperately needs some mental help and maybe some medication. This isn't something you can fix with love or affirmations. She literally sees something you don't see and has spent years fixating on this, so now, it's just how her brain works.

It sounds like you tried really hard to give her what she \"needs\", but it unfortunately led to burnout, something that anyone would've eventually gotten to. \n\nYTA too for allowing it to go on that long. Your GF has no boundaries with herself and her thought patterns and unfortunately, you enabled her. Our minds become addicted to cortisol (stress chemical) and want more, so the brain feeds into that thought pattern and it cycles and spirals.
