Recently we've been running into some issues because of his grooming.\n\nI occasionally noticed a funk coming off of him, and a few times it got bad enough to ask him to take a shower because it was distracting me and grossing me out. He apologized, and said he had a lessened sense of smell, which made him less likely to realize he needed a shower. Sounded kinda BS to me, but he showered, so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nOur apartment has two full bathrooms in the hallway, and I ordered a bidet for mine. The other day, I was installing it, and he happened upon me doing so. He asked what it was for, and I explained. He chuckled, and said \"You gay guys are something else.\" I laughed and said, \"It's less invasive than toilet paper, and more effective!\" and he laughed and said \"Yeah, but I don't use that either!\"\n\nSomething clicked in my head, and I asked him for clarification. Apparently he never wipes. He says he thinks it's gross to \"rub \\[his\\] ass with a piece of paper that doesn't really do anything.\" He said no straight guy does, and it's not a big deal. I asked what he does if he eats taco bell or something, and he said he just takes a shower. I asked what if he's in a public bathroom. He says he waits until he gets home. I then asked if he washes his butt in the shower and he said that the soap from his back drips down and takes care of it.\n\nAt this point I was basically gagging, and told him he can't sit on any of the furniture I pay for (which is most of it) until he wipes and washes his crusty ass. He got mad, and says the only reason I care is because I get fucked in mine, to which I responded that I'm a top.\n\nHe got pissy and left after this, and I haven't seen him since. I called his girlfriend to ask if she has heard from him, and she said he came over, explained the situation, she got grossed out, and he left her place.

I have an education that encompasses both biology and psychology, so I am aware that as an animal we have not always bathed. I am aware that we have not always had access to a lot of amenities that we do now, especially in regard to cleanliness. None of that excuses what I just read.\n\nI also had a friend in grad school who, after a lecture on the topic, stopped bathing in order to preserve his biome. I never smelled any funk coming from him, but he was very clean aside from that. His hair, over the span of several months, even looked less \"dirty and/or oily.\" However, again, he did maintain his hygiene aside from not bathing; meaning that he washed his clothes, would spot bathe, including using water, but only water to clean himself after things like taking a shit (he did use toilet paper, but would not use wet wipes, so particularly nasty shits would lead to him taking a shower), or going on a run, or doing yard work, etc... Actually, as I type this, he is the first person I knew who had a bidet... hu... \n\nFor the record, we hung out a lot and as someone who bathes every day, and always has, I was absolutely stunned by his behavior and asked questions all the time. This is why I know so much about his habits. The young psychiatrist in me simply could not reconcile someone choosing to live in such a way.\n\nI digress, I think I started typing all that in a stream of conscious state to reconcile that there is a difference between someone who simply does not bathe for whatever reason, and someone who is disgusting and filthy.
