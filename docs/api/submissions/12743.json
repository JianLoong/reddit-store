He apologized, and said he had a lessened sense of smell, which made him less likely to realize he needed a shower. Sounded kinda BS to me, but he showered, so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nOur apartment has two full bathrooms in the hallway, and I ordered a bidet for mine. The other day, I was installing it, and he happened upon me doing so. He asked what it was for, and I explained. He chuckled, and said \"You gay guys are something else.\" I laughed and said, \"It's less invasive than toilet paper, and more effective!\" and he laughed and said \"Yeah, but I don't use that either!\"\n\nSomething clicked in my head, and I asked him for clarification. Apparently he never wipes. He says he thinks it's gross to \"rub \\[his\\] ass with a piece of paper that doesn't really do anything.\" He said no straight guy does, and it's not a big deal. I asked what he does if he eats taco bell or something, and he said he just takes a shower. I asked what if he's in a public bathroom. He says he waits until he gets home. I then asked if he washes his butt in the shower and he said that the soap from his back drips down and takes care of it.\n\nAt this point I was basically gagging, and told him he can't sit on any of the furniture I pay for (which is most of it) until he wipes and washes his crusty ass. He got mad, and says the only reason I care is because I get fucked in mine, to which I responded that I'm a top.\n\nHe got pissy and left after this, and I haven't seen him since. I called his girlfriend to ask if she has heard from him, and she said he came over, explained the situation, she got grossed out, and he left her place.
