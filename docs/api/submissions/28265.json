I never got adopted or found a forever family. I'm now married to my husband Jamie. Jamie's sister Bev and her husband Mike are foster parents. They were starting the process when I first met them 5 years ago and they have been actively fostering for the last three years. 18 months ago they had Daisy (12) placed with them. She's their first longer time foster and they have mentioned they want to keep her and adopt her in the near future.\n\nDaisy has not been on board with that idea and there's a tension surrounding them and a lack of trust on Daisy's part. Bev and Mike have not always discussed what's going on with their family. For the most part they act like things are perfect. But Daisy talks to me. She knows I'm a former foster kid and I think she finds comfort in having someone who gets certain things.\n\nDaisy's willingness to talk to me drives Bev crazy. Recently she cornered me and said we needed to talk. She was pissed that Daisy and I had been deep in conversation for a couple of hours and that Daisy said more to me, though she couldn't hear exactly what she was saying, in the two hours we spoke than Daisy had said to her since she moved in with them 18 months prior.\n\nThe biggest issue is Bev and Mike cannot understand that Daisy loves her mom and wants to be with her again. Daisy has talked about Mike and Bev being against her feelings for her mom. Bev also went on a tyraid about it not being good for Daisy. That in the fostering classes it was mentioned and discussed at length but she never figured a kid would want a drug addicted parent over a loving family who do everything she never got with her bio parent. Bev sees it as the job of a foster parent to show their foster kid that it's not good to crave someone who doesn't treat you right. She said it would be their failure to let a kid refuse to accept a family in favor of someone who didn't want them.\n\nThen she ranted about Daisy talking to me openly and being more upfront with me. I said sometimes foster kids want someone who gets it. Bev said it didn't make sense though and I should be doing more to help and encouraging Daisy to open up. I told her she and Mike needed help before Daisy should be talking more openly to them. She asked what the fuck that meant and I said it was the way she talked about Daisy's love for her mom and wish to return to her. I told her it makes her the worst kind of trying to do good foster parent there is. Because you can't look beyond what you think is right to try and understand and accept that being a foster kid comes with complex emotions and wishes and while I fully believe that you are trying to do good for Daisy, you are doing way more harm than you realize.\n\nBev is furious with me and while Jamie and even some of my other ILs defended me, I wonder if I stepped over the line.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696493503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170ccr8/aita_for_telling_my_sil_shes_the_worst_kind_of/", "score": 372, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needles to understand that your parent is your parent, and although some adults/kids understand their parents faults and want nothing to do with them that's up to them to decide - not someone else. \n\nIt sounds like she had a great childhood and just cannot empathise with people who didn't. She needs to take a step back, swallow her pride, admit she needs to do more learning and get on with it. \n\nShe's lucky to have you to help her tbh", "NTA, Daisy is lucky to have you in her corner.

But although I have never been in the system nor do I know anybody in person who was, to me it's quite natural to just want your mom. The bond you share with your bio-family and especially with your mom is strong. \n\nI always thought this was common knowledge. Obviously it isn't. \n\nSomeone who tries to supress the feelings of a kid in their care is not mature enough to actually foster a kid. Especially if said kid went through a lot. I agree with you that such saviour-people do more harm than good. They don't mean to but that doesn't change the outcome. \n\nI am happy for Daisy she has at least you. And no I don't think you overstepped. You probably know it yourself, deep down you not only stood up and were there for Daisy. Part of you did it for the kid you were. And that is totally awsome. You doing something you maybe would've needed when you were young gives Daisy what she needs now. Someone who gets it, like you stated so perfectly already.

You are 100% not wrong.", "NTA OP.\n\nBev is using true information (or semi true) to support her own warped goals. You see it a lot with foster or adoptive parents where they get a child as a way to avoid dealing with their own psychological problems. Don\u2019t know what those are for Bev, maybe infertility, or maybe projection. But that\u2019s her problem.\n\nFor Daisy, it so sucks being hard wired to love the person that birthed you, that societally and biologically is supposed to love you, yet they love drugs more. This love, or love in general doesn\u2019t need to be logical, it rarely ever is. Daisy\u2019s a teenager, with her own truly hellish situation, where logic and feelings barely overlap and where one can only feel lost.\n\nShe\u2019s turning to you **because** you walked this path before and survived. Because in a world she\u2019s lost and confused in there\u2019s someone who might just know what she\u2019s going through and find a way out.\n\nAlso, with the foster system. It\u2019s a true eye opener to kids about how in reality their lives are in control of very few adults, and how they do often are very poorly suited to make choices over them. Look at Bev, she\u2019s letting her own emotions blind her judgement over her foster child.\n\nIt\u2019s what psychologists would define as \u201cOppositional Defiance Disorder\u201d, or what a competent psychologist or anyone with an understanding of kids and the foster system would call \u201ca learnt distrust of a system not built to support you\u201d. The CPS agents are part of that system, Bev and Jamie are part of that system. Naturally Daisy wouldn\u2019t talk to them, but you survived the system, she would talk to you.\n\nEveryone here needs a level of a reality check, given to them in the best ways suited for them. \n\nBev and Mike need to be told \u201cDaisy isn\u2019t your daughter, she doesn\u2019t have to love you. You\u2019re there to support her, not the other way around, and I understand you\u2019re hurt that she doesn\u2019t trust you and doesn\u2019t really talk to you but that\u2019s life. It\u2019s unfair and the most important job you can have as a parent is to accept and suffer that unfairness head on so your child doesn\u2019t have to\u201d.\n\nFor Daisy it\u2019s to learn that Mommy isn\u2019t a healthy person to be with. There\u2019s a level of acceptance to arrive to in that, to truly ask yourself how much control and emotional investment I should give this person in my life. Daisy\u2019s unfortunate that she has to ask herself this so young but she\u2019s fortunate to have you as a big sister to help her. If you trust in Mike and Bev, and if they get their heads on straight, it might benefit Daisy to allow herself to give them a chance. \n\nDon\u2019t force her, don\u2019t tell her what to do. Just provide arguments, let her consider them and then agree with her conclusion. Understand that Ike and Bev don\u2019t replace her mom, that they\u2019ll just be there to care for her and give her the affection she deserves. Ultimately unless Mommy dearest changes she will be stuck in the system, it might help if she can learn acceptance in that, if she can look past the denial and the desperate need for comfort and familiarity of her mom. \n\nThis issue is way deep, and If not already I\u2019d recommend a therapist. And please seriously do get a therapist that\u2019s as critical of the parents as the child, it\u2019s the only way they\u2019ll have equal footing in the discussion and the only chance Daisy will have at success and healing through it. \n\nBest of luck OP, you\u2019re NTA, you\u2019re her guardian Angel.", "NTA, and I sort of think you have an obligation to report this behavior to... someone. I'm not sure if CPS handles fosters or if there is another department that would be more apt, but if they are housing her and waging war on her emotionally like that, it could have very negative consequences for Daisy down the line. Her life is complicated enough without a foster mother who seems more fixated on her own personal fulfillment than Daisy's mental health needs. I realize this could seriously create problems for your family, if this information is some that only you could have and report them for, but it might be necessary. They shouldn't be able to adopt her if they're going to spend her remaining childhood years trying to pressure her into hating her biological mother and loving them instead.", "NTA. I am very glad that Daisy has you.", "NTA. You are a great human being, keep it up!", "NTA. your SIL is fostering for herself. She wants to make herself feel good and special by how much she\u2019s \u201cdoing for the children\u201d vs focusing on what the child truly needs. \n\nYou\u2019re looking out for daisy. No matter how crap a parent may be, that\u2019s daisy\u2019s parent and it\u2019s not weird/crazy/whatever that\u2019s she\u2019s going to want them in their life, that\u2019s just such a natural desire. Daisy may change her mind as she gets older,  goes to therapy, and realizes that the bio parent that they want and deserve is likely never going to happen and then she will likely have to mourn that before being able to move on. (I was not a foster child but I had an addicted father and an enabler mother, so I myself had many of these feelings well into adulthood). \n\nKeep being there for Daisy. This is about her. Not about your SILs \u201cfeelings\u201d. Daisy is a child and she needs someone she trusts in her corner.", "NTA.  As another commentor said you should reach out to their caseworker.  Based on this behavior I don't think they have Daisy's best interest in mind.

Frankly Daisy's feelings are far more important in this situation than Bev's", "Nta can you report Bev to the agency to get more classes ? This situation sounds toxic for daisy. \n\nForster care should be focused on family re-unification when it\u2019s appropriate. Bev should get that.

You brought a real-world perspective: complex emotions. \n\nI do see Bev\u2019s perspective: she provides a loving home and education and friends over and sock hops. Whatever. \n\nBut Daisy loves her mom still. That\u2019s a fact. And it\u2019s actually a strength of Daisy\u2019s character: she continues to love someone struggling. \n\nBev absolutely needs to get that.

If she still doesn't get it through her thick skull that she's currently being a problem in this young girls life, then maybe something more firm is in order. \n\nNTA.

Thank you for listening to Daisy as Bev obviously is not listening to her.", "The thing is, what Bev was told in the classes, that kids loving and missing their bio families is natural and wanting to go home is as well but all kids are different and will respond differently, is correct. Also the part about not talking negatively about their feelings for their bio family. But it doesn't feed into what Bev feels is right and she feels she knows better than the people teaching the classes, her foster daughter currently feeling this stuff, and a former foster kid who has experience of the complex feelings that can happen.\n\nIt is depressingly common and even more depressing is it is a common enough thing with foster parents.", "There can be if you want.

They should never be allowed to foster and I really hope you report this to someone. Bev sounds like a nightmare from hell. Who does she think she is getting mad at a child for loving their mother? Much less a child she\u2019s only known 18 months.

You are supporting this child and doing what's right for her although Bev is not getting it.\n\nFun fact: we ended up going NC with my Mom's side of the family minus two of my aunts to to abuse of various kinds and a blow-up with a revelation about more abuse from one of the aunts. I wasn't overly close to my grandmother (Had started to notice she was a little off-she was the abusive one.) but I adored my grandfather. He was just an enabler. Didn't abuse anybody but didn't do anything. When we broke off Mom told him that if he didn't fight for me (at least writing me letters or SOMETHING she would not be letting him try to come back in down the road pretending nothing happened. Years later he did try to get in contact with me and pointed out how much of a loving stay at home mother my grandmother was (She WORKED outside the home for most of their childhood, lol) and I told him that if he could not ACKNOWLEDGE that bad things happened (not talk about but just not pretend they didn't happen) then we were done. Never heard from him again.  He's dead now and sometimes I still miss the grandfather who would collect walnuts with me and joke about the planet Murple. \n\nLong winded point..... It's hard to cut contract with someone you LOVE no matter how toxic or screwed up the relationship is; especially when you are young. My Mom let me decide (to a degree) how I wanted to process with things when my grandpa reached out because it was MY relationship. It sucked, but I realized she was right because she gave me all the facts and I was able to come to the conclusion not having a relationship was healthier all on my own.", "NTA. I'm so glad Daisy has you to talk to.", "NTA.\n\nBev is making it all about herself instead of making it about Daisy and how she feels.

I've been working with foster kids for years, and fact is, even children who were horribly physically abused often want to go back to their parents. Even if it's unsafe. Even if parental rights are terminated. Even if it's genuinely not in their best interest.\n\nThe best way to help a foster kid through that, or anything, is to do what you're doing: Listen, and give them some agency about how they feel. Most come to realize as they mature that going 'home' isn't the best idea, even if they don't want you to adopt them.

It takes time to build up trust and depends on the amount of trauma experienced by the kid. \n\nFoster parenting classes specifically teach how to parent traumatized kids (e.g. never put the kids in \u201ctime-out\u201d in their room, put the kids in \u201ctime-in\u201d sitting quietly in the same room as you because many kids have abandonment issues). Your SIL has willfully not listened in the foster parenting classes and is doing mental damage to Daisy.\n\nUnfortunately, social workers will not remove Daisy from her placement due to lack of available foster families - she is physically well cared for and the conflict will be considered too minor to warrant a new placement. I\u2019ve had 2 emergency placements with me when foster kids were transferred from other foster families to me. They were only transferred when their mental state became so bad, the social workers determined that it would be physically dangerous for the kids\u2019 well-being to stay in their original foster homes.\n\nOP, please continue being Daisy\u2019s confidant. As one of my emergency placement kids told me, it helps immensely to know she\u2019s being heard and that somebody understands.", "Adoptee here, you are absolutely correct, and Bev is completely in the wrong.", "Not sure if the adoptive mom knew.  But my mom remembers that when D came to live with them, she had a lot of nice clothes and toys from her home.  They were the first foster.  So no indication that her home was bad. From what D found out from extended family her birth mother had no close living relatives and birth father's family was just his widowed mother with several minor kids.  This was in the late 50's so the place her for adoption and most information was strongly sealed.", "Sounds like the caseworker needs to be called...", "Call the caseworker so that bev and Mike can be reminded of the purpose of foster care, which is obviously not their own emotional fulfillment.", "You're speaking with the voice of experience. Assuming you said it the way you report here - calmly, no insults - then NTA. Bev might not like what she heard, but she can't fault you for saying it.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA! Bev needs a wake up call and I think it\u2019s awesome that Daisy has you and feels comfortable with you. You voiced the needs for a child who doesn\u2019t feel like they have a voice that will be heard, you did right by her!!", "No.  This was a hard truth only you could explain.  If she had been open to what you were telling her she would have heard that she is pushing too hard and trying to force Daisy to love her.  She needs to back the f off and give Daisy the chance to learn to trust her and allow her feelings to grow and change at her own pace.  They either love her unconditionally, or they don't.  What are they going to do when Daisy is a teenager, acting like a normal teenager who hates them and treats them like garbage?  If Daisy's unconditional love is part of that equation the relationship will self-combust.", "NTA. You told her the truth and she needs to hear it repeatedly until she stops emotionally abusing this child because that's what she's doing.", "NTA - its a truth she absolutely needed to hear.  Kids can love the most theoretically inappropriate parents and attempting to brainwash them out of it is an automatic failure point.", "NTA. Shit like this is why I get so frustrated when people on reddit say \"you're so selfish to do IVF when there are plenty of kids in the foster system who need parents!\"\n\nThe purpose of the foster system is not to provide rich people with adoptable children, it never has been, and it never should be.", "I worked as a contract manager for family services. I worked the numbers end so I could get out of direct care. You are correct. Everything you said. Correct. And she needed to hear it. \n\nWhy?\n\nThe numbers also say nearly 100% of children will seek out the parents when the child reaches 18. Across the board, unless there is complete termination due to abuse (most cases are neglect), the child seeks out the parent. \n\nNTA. She shouldn\u2019t poison her own chance with her foster daughter\u2019s bio mother if there is any possibility of future reunifications at any point. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest to say bio mom was a good person but bad at parenting. Best thing to say. Not everyone can parent a child that they love very much.", "You're NTA. It's a shame that Bev is more concerned about her own feelings than she is about Daisy's feelings. I thought the purpose of fostering children was to help the kids and give them a safe place to stay. I didn't think it was all about making the adults feel good.\n\nOn one hand, I want to say good for Bev and Mike for being foster parents, but it doesn't sound like Bev's motives are totally pure. Maybe she needs to take those courses again. Or at least, be quiet and listen to you and her foster daughter.", "NTA.\n\nYeah, your SIL has an issue she needs to work on.  You can't force someone to love you (or anyone else), nor force them to stop loving someone.  The kid isn't going to just stop loving their mom and want to be with SIL and adopted because SIL says so.\n\nYou were right in what you said, and it was your truthful opinion.  Not an AH for that since she asked for it.", "NTA I can\u2019t really elaborate why bc it\u2019s kinda obvious to me\u2026? but ur just NTA", "Your SILs approach essentially says that love is conditional and that you should abandon your family when they let you down.\n\nIn what universe is that an appropriate message to send to a child that you would like to have as a part of your family?", "Every time I read stuff like this it makes me want foster kids NOW! I was not a foster kid but easily could have been (I was on a \"foster\" programme where I spent weekends with a family), and I find this very easy to understand.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm nowhere near being stable enough to offer my home up. :(", "Can you report her?? Like, she doesn't care and she thinks she's right, where she clearly isn't. NTA OP at all", "What about hope? It could be Daisy still has hope for her parents to get better? Does she see or visit them?\n\nIf they\u2019re not trying that would break the illusion of hope, and false hope can be super toxic, so there\u2019s that.", "Well, of course they didn't, why would they, it's not like you want to do the best possible job."]}
