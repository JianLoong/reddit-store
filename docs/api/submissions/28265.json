I never got adopted or found a forever family. I'm now married to my husband Jamie. Jamie's sister Bev and her husband Mike are foster parents. They were starting the process when I first met them 5 years ago and they have been actively fostering for the last three years. 18 months ago they had Daisy (12) placed with them. She's their first longer time foster and they have mentioned they want to keep her and adopt her in the near future.\n\nDaisy has not been on board with that idea and there's a tension surrounding them and a lack of trust on Daisy's part. Bev and Mike have not always discussed what's going on with their family. For the most part they act like things are perfect. But Daisy talks to me. She knows I'm a former foster kid and I think she finds comfort in having someone who gets certain things.\n\nDaisy's willingness to talk to me drives Bev crazy. Recently she cornered me and said we needed to talk. She was pissed that Daisy and I had been deep in conversation for a couple of hours and that Daisy said more to me, though she couldn't hear exactly what she was saying, in the two hours we spoke than Daisy had said to her since she moved in with them 18 months prior.\n\nThe biggest issue is Bev and Mike cannot understand that Daisy loves her mom and wants to be with her again. Daisy has talked about Mike and Bev being against her feelings for her mom. Bev also went on a tyraid about it not being good for Daisy. That in the fostering classes it was mentioned and discussed at length but she never figured a kid would want a drug addicted parent over a loving family who do everything she never got with her bio parent. Bev sees it as the job of a foster parent to show their foster kid that it's not good to crave someone who doesn't treat you right. She said it would be their failure to let a kid refuse to accept a family in favor of someone who didn't want them.\n\nThen she ranted about Daisy talking to me openly and being more upfront with me. I said sometimes foster kids want someone who gets it. Bev said it didn't make sense though and I should be doing more to help and encouraging Daisy to open up. I told her she and Mike needed help before Daisy should be talking more openly to them. She asked what the fuck that meant and I said it was the way she talked about Daisy's love for her mom and wish to return to her. I told her it makes her the worst kind of trying to do good foster parent there is. Because you can't look beyond what you think is right to try and understand and accept that being a foster kid comes with complex emotions and wishes and while I fully believe that you are trying to do good for Daisy, you are doing way more harm than you realize.\n\nBev is furious with me and while Jamie and even some of my other ILs defended me, I wonder if I stepped over the line.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696493503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170ccr8/aita_for_telling_my_sil_shes_the_worst_kind_of/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure the foster classes say one thing but the thing is things are not always textbook! Bev is a moron.\nSide note this is depressingly common that people listen and don\u2019t understand. Sad.", "NTA, try to get a hold of her case worker.  It is abusive to tell her that she should not be missing her mom.  Your SIL is not the right fit for this girl or any girl.  I was adopted at the age of 10 days old.  Like many adoptees I have a large number of friends that were adopted.  One friend D was adopted at the age of 4.  Her adoptive mother never stopped reminding her that they \"saved\" her from the system and how luck she was to have a \"real\" family not the awful one she was born into.  Messed her up a lot.  It was not until a few years ago she found out her parents were killed in a car accident.", "NTA, and Bev is TA by far. How dare you -checks notes- be someone who's had similar experience to a troubled child? Wtf? She's not listening to the kid she's caring for, and Daisy's never gonna trust her the way she's doing things now. I hope you're able to be there for Daisy, it sounds like she's gonna need someone in her corner.", "NTA Bev is not acting very mature as it seems she\u2018s just trying to fulfil her perfect family fantasies without even taking daisy\u2018s thoughts and feelings into consideration. That does not seem like the right home for a child, eventhough they can provide her with stuff money can buy but lack the emotional labour it takes to bond. I am glad Daisy has someone in her corner.", "Nta!! **not the asshole!!** nope, not, no way!\n\nBev needs to be listening to you, you're the one with experience here, not her!\n\nI do think you could have been gentler about it, in an ideal world, but she was the one who cornered you at a family function to berate you about having a relationship with your Foster neice. She needed to hear it. \n\nOnce she's calmed down I would speak to her and apologise for your tone but that you stand by what you said. She needles to understand that your parent is your parent, and although some adults/kids understand their parents faults and want nothing to do with them that's up to them to decide - not someone else. \n\nIt sounds like she had a great childhood and just cannot empathise with people who didn't. She needs to take a step back, swallow her pride, admit she needs to do more learning and get on with it. \n\nShe's lucky to have you to help her tbh", "NTA, Daisy is lucky to have you in her corner. Is there continuing classes or therapy or something for foster families? Something like that would be really helpful. I feel like Daisy wanting to be with her mom is natural, that your sil should know its just common sense.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe bev is not cut out for this kind of work?", "I'm not a foster kid. But although I have never been in the system nor do I know anybody in person who was, to me it's quite natural to just want your mom. The bond you share with your bio-family and especially with your mom is strong. \n\nI always thought this was common knowledge. Obviously it isn't. \n\nSomeone who tries to supress the feelings of a kid in their care is not mature enough to actually foster a kid. Especially if said kid went through a lot. I agree with you that such saviour-people do more harm than good. They don't mean to but that doesn't change the outcome. \n\nI am happy for Daisy she has at least you. And no I don't think you overstepped. You probably know it yourself, deep down you not only stood up and were there for Daisy. Part of you did it for the kid you were. And that is totally awsome. You doing something you maybe would've needed when you were young gives Daisy what she needs now. Someone who gets it, like you stated so perfectly already. Someone who listens and takes her seriously. \n\nYou did not cross a line. You stood up for Daisy who could not make herself heard. I think you're doing a great job here. \n\nNTA", "NTA - you did not step over a line. Your SIL asked, you answered honestly. You have experience from the \"other\" side as it were, which is why Daisy feels comfortable confiding in you. Bev is not listening to what her foster daughter is saying, and from the sounds of it, refuses to believe that humans can be actual humans with feelings and stuff.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are 100% not wrong.", "NTA OP.\n\nBev is using true information (or semi true) to support her own warped goals. You see it a lot with foster or adoptive parents where they get a child as a way to avoid dealing with their own psychological problems. Don\u2019t know what those are for Bev, maybe infertility, or maybe projection. But that\u2019s her problem.\n\nFor Daisy, it so sucks being hard wired to love the person that birthed you, that societally and biologically is supposed to love you, yet they love drugs more. This love, or love in general doesn\u2019t need to be logical, it rarely ever is. Daisy\u2019s a teenager, with her own truly hellish situation, where logic and feelings barely overlap and where one can only feel lost.\n\nShe\u2019s turning to you **because** you walked this path before and survived. Because in a world she\u2019s lost and confused in there\u2019s someone who might just know what she\u2019s going through and find a way out.\n\nAlso, with the foster system. It\u2019s a true eye opener to kids about how in reality their lives are in control of very few adults, and how they do often are very poorly suited to make choices over them. Look at Bev, she\u2019s letting her own emotions blind her judgement over her foster child.\n\nIt\u2019s what psychologists would define as \u201cOppositional Defiance Disorder\u201d, or what a competent psychologist or anyone with an understanding of kids and the foster system would call \u201ca learnt distrust of a system not built to support you\u201d. The CPS agents are part of that system, Bev and Jamie are part of that system. Naturally Daisy wouldn\u2019t talk to them, but you survived the system, she would talk to you.\n\nEveryone here needs a level of a reality check, given to them in the best ways suited for them. \n\nBev and Mike need to be told \u201cDaisy isn\u2019t your daughter, she doesn\u2019t have to love you. You\u2019re there to support her, not the other way around, and I understand you\u2019re hurt that she doesn\u2019t trust you and doesn\u2019t really talk to you but that\u2019s life. It\u2019s unfair and the most important job you can have as a parent is to accept and suffer that unfairness head on so your child doesn\u2019t have to\u201d.\n\nFor Daisy it\u2019s to learn that Mommy isn\u2019t a healthy person to be with. There\u2019s a level of acceptance to arrive to in that, to truly ask yourself how much control and emotional investment I should give this person in my life. Daisy\u2019s unfortunate that she has to ask herself this so young but she\u2019s fortunate to have you as a big sister to help her. If you trust in Mike and Bev, and if they get their heads on straight, it might benefit Daisy to allow herself to give them a chance. \n\nDon\u2019t force her, don\u2019t tell her what to do. Just provide arguments, let her consider them and then agree with her conclusion. Understand that Ike and Bev don\u2019t replace her mom, that they\u2019ll just be there to care for her and give her the affection she deserves. Ultimately unless Mommy dearest changes she will be stuck in the system, it might help if she can learn acceptance in that, if she can look past the denial and the desperate need for comfort and familiarity of her mom. \n\nThis issue is way deep, and If not already I\u2019d recommend a therapist. And please seriously do get a therapist that\u2019s as critical of the parents as the child, it\u2019s the only way they\u2019ll have equal footing in the discussion and the only chance Daisy will have at success and healing through it. \n\nBest of luck OP, you\u2019re NTA, you\u2019re her guardian Angel.", "NTA, and I sort of think you have an obligation to report this behavior to... someone. I'm not sure if CPS handles fosters or if there is another department that would be more apt, but if they are housing her and waging war on her emotionally like that, it could have very negative consequences for Daisy down the line. Her life is complicated enough without a foster mother who seems more fixated on her own personal fulfillment than Daisy's mental health needs. I realize this could seriously create problems for your family, if this information is some that only you could have and report them for, but it might be necessary. They shouldn't be able to adopt her if they're going to spend her remaining childhood years trying to pressure her into hating her biological mother and loving them instead.", "NTA. I am very glad that Daisy has you.", "NTA. You are a great human being, keep it up!", "NTA. your SIL is fostering for herself. She wants to make herself feel good and special by how much she\u2019s \u201cdoing for the children\u201d vs focusing on what the child truly needs. \n\nYou\u2019re looking out for daisy. No matter how crap a parent may be, that\u2019s daisy\u2019s parent and it\u2019s not weird/crazy/whatever that\u2019s she\u2019s going to want them in their life, that\u2019s just such a natural desire. Daisy may change her mind as she gets older,  goes to therapy, and realizes that the bio parent that they want and deserve is likely never going to happen and then she will likely have to mourn that before being able to move on. (I was not a foster child but I had an addicted father and an enabler mother, so I myself had many of these feelings well into adulthood). \n\nKeep being there for Daisy. This is about her. Not about your SILs \u201cfeelings\u201d. Daisy is a child and she needs someone she trusts in her corner.", "NTA.  As another commentor said you should reach out to their caseworker.  Based on this behavior I don't think they have Daisy's best interest in mind.  Your sister seems to see Daisy as an accessory to complete her picture perfect family, not a child who has her own experiences and trauma.  Frankly Daisy's feelings are far more important in this situation than Bev's", "Nta can you report Bev to the agency to get more classes ? This situation sounds toxic for daisy. \n\nForster care should be focused on family re-unification when it\u2019s appropriate. Bev should get that. It sucks daisys mom isn\u2019t getting the support and rehab to get her back. Daisys feelings totally make sense", "NTA. You brought a real-world perspective: complex emotions. \n\nI do see Bev\u2019s perspective: she provides a loving home and education and friends over and sock hops. Whatever. \n\nBut Daisy loves her mom still. That\u2019s a fact. And it\u2019s actually a strength of Daisy\u2019s character: she continues to love someone struggling. \n\nBev absolutely needs to get that. But Daisy, not OP, needs to talk to the caseworker if this placement is an inappropriate fit.", "Advocating for a traumatized 12 year old pining for her mother isn\u2019t over the line. You are the expert in this situation, foster mom sounds like the type who\u2019ll only hear what they want to hear and reject everything else.", "NTA", "Oh no, you told her like it is. The horror of being real with someone who is misunderstanding the situation. If she still doesn't get it through her thick skull that she's currently being a problem in this young girls life, then maybe something more firm is in order. \n\nNTA. If you don't advocate for this child, who will? Her foster parents obviously have a set vision of what it should be like and they're trying to force a square peg into a round hole. Something is going to break, and I hope it isn't the poor child.", "NTA.   Thank you for listening to Daisy as Bev obviously is not listening to her.", "The thing is, what Bev was told in the classes, that kids loving and missing their bio families is natural and wanting to go home is as well but all kids are different and will respond differently, is correct. Also the part about not talking negatively about their feelings for their bio family. But it doesn't feed into what Bev feels is right and she feels she knows better than the people teaching the classes, her foster daughter currently feeling this stuff, and a former foster kid who has experience of the complex feelings that can happen.\n\nIt is depressingly common and even more depressing is it is a common enough thing with foster parents.", "There can be if you want. But it's not mandatory in any way and Bev and Mike did not attend more than they were obligated to.", "Sounds like Bev needs a shrink for herself", "Thank you for being there for Daisy. I\u2019m sure it means the world to her. \n\nBev does not seem emotionally mature enough to understand the nuances and psychology of kids. I was abused by my mother and even now in my 30s I *still* crave a relationship with her which I know can never exist. This shit is hard. I\u2019m glad Daisy has you to talk to. You\u2019re 100% NTA", "I mean...honestly, at this point Daisy would ask to be fostered with *you*."]}
