Prior to this, our relationship was pretty good, but after moving in I realized some stuff about him that frankly, I probably would not have known beforehand.\n\nHe has a really weird and frankly offputting obsession with hentai. He has skimpy anime girls with massive breasts as all of his laptop wallpapers, he has an entire folder of his bookshelves have a bunch of soft porny manga, he has posters with skimpy anime girls on them, along with figures of scantily clad anime girls and video game characters, and around half of the games he plays have these insanely hypersexualized female characters who he often plays as. He's an artist and his sketchbooks are half taken up by art of a similar nature.\n\nIf this was just the porn he liked to look at privately, whatever, I wouldn't care. If it was just a few anime figures, whatever, a little weird, but I still wouldn't care that much. The problem I have is that this obsession with porny cartoon women extends way further into his life than just his taste in porn. The issue is, you would *never* know he was into this sort of stuff from just meeting him. He never talks about it or acts skeevy or brings it up. The only reason I even know is because I live with him.\n\nI basically sat down and told him I don't like how prevalent the hentai and softcore anime porn stuff is in our house. I told him it makes me uncomfortable in my own house. I asked him to either box it up and put it away, or to get rid of it entirely. He refused, so I tried to find a way to compromise. I asked him to start small, like maybe just putting the anime figures in storage and changing his desktop wallpaper, but told him his obsession with this sort of media makes me uncomfortable. He offered to take down the posters above his desk and move the anime figures and his desk to another part of our apartment so they wouldn't be displayed so prominently, but refused to change his desktop background or put the figures away. I told him that anyone who comes in our apartment is going to think he's a skeevy porn creep, and that I find the fact that he's *this* into hentai stuff offputting. He told me I was trying to police his interests or what he's allowed to own or have in our house, and it devolved into an argument.

I don't think softcore hentai is appropriate apartment decorations for adults who want to have guests and a normal life. He has some growing up to do.", "INFO: where is this happening? Bedroom? Or common areas guests would be likely to visit. The latter gives you more leeway to object because it's your place too.\n\nINFO: how the hell didn't you notice this? Did you *never* arrange to see how he lived? I mean, if you were ever in his prior apartment/bedroom, you wouldn't be able to miss it if he's always like this. It's one thing to miss some little poster on the wall, but if it's all over the place you'd have to have seen it.\n\nThe assholery turns entirely on where these things are. You can't just be like \"this part of your life you seem to be really into needs to go right now\". I suppose you can, but it'd have to be \"or I'm going to leave\" form. Which...might not get you the result you want", "INFO: If you had more space and he has his own gaming/office/hobby room and kept all the stuff in there, would that be okay?", "I'm really between E S H and N A h.\n\n\n\n-First of all... That's not hentai. It's just... Not. I came here REALLY wanting to be on your side OP, but I just can't after reading the whole post. A lot of anime and gamer type culture involves fanservice and super sexualized female characters. It's part of the allure of the fandom. Do I think it's a little bit childish? Yes. Would I bar my partner from engaging with it? Absolutely not. Do I think a grown adult man should base his entire decoration style around anime tiddies? Hell no. That said though, this is clearly something he is passionate about. I don't think barring him from expressing it at all is a healthy way to start off cohabitating.\n\n\n\n\n-If you are really serious about staying with this guy, and honestly given how you framed this, I don't think you are, maybe a little compromise is in order. I've watched this scenario play out a million times before, even been a part of it myself, and this is what I have seen works. \n\nIf there are enough rooms to do so, designate one room as a room for that type of artwork/decor. For example, I have a \"witch room\" for all my misc. spiritual decor and books to keep them out of the central parts of the house (this is my choice to avoid issues with religious family members.) My fiance has all his various outdoor and hiking gear in his office.\n\nMy best friend and her husband have their office set up so they both have their various interests on display in a non-objectionable way. He has all his Legos and transformers figurines set up nicely, and she has her small library on the other side with all her craft things. The rest of the house is set up very nicely with little touches of both of them, but nothing that screams \"NEERRRRRRRD!\" \n\nIf that doesn't work for y'all, be it because space is limited or you just cannot allow him to have any safe space to express himself, find the figurines/art pieces you find the least objectionable and offer to allow those to stay and that he pack up the more objectionable ones and POLITELY explain why. Explain that he doesn't have to get rid of them, but that you would prefer he have some of the more profane ones put up. \n\n\n\n\n-If none of that works? Get out of his house, honey.", "Info: I wish we could see the figures etc.\n\nBecause a lot of mainstream anime figures look really sus but i wouldnt expect my partner to put away their Asuna figure or their Rem figure yk.\n\nBut if its some niche ass hentai and its all super graphic then i can see having an issue with that. \n\nI think asking him to change his desktop background is a bit far, who else is using his pc besides himself? And with the figures thats often a normal part of the hobby so without knowing how it all looks its hard to judge\n\nAsking him to take down presumably large posters of scantily clad women seems reasonable tho. Thats much more in your face that figures on a shelf or desk. \n\nAnd if the issue is that you arent able to decorate how you want then that is a different issue and you should definitely be able to have a say in customising the home. \n\nWhether that means you each get different rooms to decorate or certain things become a compromise etc.", "How does it \u201creach further into his life\u201d if the literal only reason you know about it is from moving into a place he previously (presumably) lived in alone?\n\nYTA\n\nYou said yourself you\u2019d never know, he doesn\u2019t act skeevy, he\u2019s a normal dude and an artist, this is one of the mediums he likes. Personally I don\u2019t care about hentai and such, so I wouldn\u2019t deck my place out in it, but I certainly have gaming decorations etc.\n\nAlso not everyone wants socializing to take place in their apartment, so they decorate for themself.", "INFO: Going off of all the comments you've made, I feel like we need a better idea of what exactly these figures or posters are of. You say they're hentai, he says they aren't. They could be ecchi, or this could be blown out of proportion, as some people have different levels of comfort with lewdness or suggestivity. If they're normal anime figures, there's nothing wrong with that. If she has her whole ass spread, then there's some issues\n\nAt the moment, YTA for failing to come to any sort of compromise other than \"get rid of all of your probably expensive things because I don't like them\" after moving in together, when a house should be equal parts both of yours. He offered to move his stuff to a more secluded place, you flat out denied him and basically offered nothing in return.\n\nHow come he can't just hide the figures and posters when guests come over?", "NTA. NSFW anime stuff is for college apartment decorations, not decor for a shared space with your partner. I am saying this as someone with a Sailor Moon merch collection. \n\nI would question if this is the kind of person you want to spend your life (or even just the next few years) with, not because he watches hentai, but because he\u2019s not getting your discomfort with it and making his obsession with lewd anime women known to anyone who comes into your home. The fact that he has no sense of shame about it is genuinely concerning.", "Before moving in with him, did you never visit his house? \n\nHow prominent can it be if you never noticed it before when you were dating,  visiting, sleeping over etc. \n\nYtA. \n\nEven his desktop? When do you even see that? And timing feels like now that you moved in you think you can dictate what he gets to like.", "Time to move out imo", "Eh ESH\n\nMy husband has the Ren and Rem \u201cwedding dress\u201d figures where it\u2019s basically a slutty bikini.\n\nIn our apartment I didn\u2019t like them because the only two places to display them were our living room, and our bedroom. I disliked both. So they lived in a box until we got our house where he has a game room and I have my craft room.\n\nI bring this up just to point out that I\u2019m familiar with the stuff that\u2019s out there. Anything worse then those figures is solid no from me. I don\u2019t even want him to buy it. But I also knew he was into this stuff looong before that and we had already talked about it and what I was comfortable with vs what he wanted. We made agreements that are mutually respectful of each other.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how you never saw that stuff and didn\u2019t know he was into it. I can\u2019t tell if you just didn\u2019t pay attention or if he hid it. That said, he knows how most people feel about that stuff and probably should have brought it up.\n\nBut honestly, it sounds like neither of you are willing to compromise and you just aren\u2019t compatible.", "NTA - Most women would be uncomfortable, especially when they\u2019re being portrayed as big bimbo caricatures. I had a (male) friend who put on this anime that was basically hentai without the sex and they main protagonist just openly assaulted the woman and sexually harassed them without any consequences and it boggled my mind how he could watch that and not see the issue with that kind of media being created.", "YTA. After reading your replies and seeing pictures of a couple figurines, I can honestly say YTA. \n\nExpecting someone to change what they're into and how they want to decorate is asshole behavior. You gave him an ultimatum, put them away or get rid of them. He gave you a compromise, move them out of the way. \n\nAnd from the pictures you've provided, they don't seem to be that lewd. Definitely not Hentai. \n\nHe should break up with you, and then you can decorate however you want.", "Ok first of all it's not \"all over the apartment\" as op claims if it's just his desk... given its the computer background, some figurines on his desk and a couple of posters above it. Sounds to me like they're not compatible if she's going to trash his interests.", "YTA.  He offered a reasonable compromise, the figures aren't even ecchi, let alone hentai.", "YTA.\n\nThis is obviously not some little quirk he has, but is a huge HUGE ginormous part of his personality and who he is.\n\nYou don't want to be with someone who is not free to be himself, do you?\n\nThat doesn't mean you have to put up with something in a partner that makes you uncomfortable, though.\n\nGiven this info, I'd just have to go ahead and label you two incompatible.  I'd suggest a bit of due diligence beforehand in  your next relationship, though.  It's dumbfounding to me that you didn't know that about him before *moving in*.", "Just leave him girl.", "NAH.\n\nHe has a right to like what he wants. If it was a model train collection, or records, or whatever, wanting to display and own that facet of personality is a god given right. Trying to force him to hide it (expressing you\u2019re ashamed of it and others would be too) is a very blurred sentiment of being ashamed of him. It will sour your relationship a ton.\n\nOn the other hand, you don\u2019t like it, and he can\u2019t force you to. I don\u2019t like it either. It\u2019s uncomfortable. Even if he boxed up all his stuff, he will still like it, enjoy it, and it will be a part of him. Can you come to terms with that? You can\u2019t erase it from your shared life together no matter what. He deserves a personal space for his hobbies, his office, and trying to control his space is not healthy for either of you.\n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me and I\u2019d walk away. I do not mesh with otaku culture, and personally I think that it\u2019s often an indicator of many red flags (not all people of course, but my personal experiences with people who enjoy this was not good - and I used to be REALLY into anime - and I mean all genders who partake).\n\nGrow up and get out or suck it up and learn to love the whole person. I hate it where people enter relationships with the intent to \u201cfix\u201d people.", "YTA and learned a lesson. Your post doesn\u2019t suggest he his this from you. You didn\u2019t do your due diligence. You have a responsibility to identify your deal breakers and communicate. And this should have been done before you moved in. You say you could never tell he had this interest? But it\u2019s pervasive in the apartment and takes up half or a majority of his artistic output. I suspect you never really paid him attention for who he was. Do him a favor and let him go. Let this poor dude find a partner that shares his interest. \n\nI can\u2019t tell whether this is anime, hentai, or full-on porn.

That really sucked, and I didn't like how she tried to suppress that interest of mine.\n\nOn the flipside, if these, as you're suggesting, lewd, and semi-pornographic figures and posters are on display in common areas, and even private areas in a shared space, that's also not particularly appropriate or adult (unless agreed upon beforehand).\n\nThis kind of thing should really be hashed out prior to moving in together.", "NTA\n\nFor decorations?

To me it just sounds like another person who thinks anime is immature and childish and wants her bf to change b", "No I think it's the hypersexualized posters of women part that is bothering people. \n\nBut you can't and shouldn't try to force people to change, so she should just leave.", "Its toxic to ask you partner to take his softcore porn and not have it plastered everywhere? Again, this tells us all we need to know.", "Yeah that doesn't make it better. Functional adults don't move in with people without having ever been to their place before.\n\nIt sounds like you probably don't have the life experience to write a story like this in a believable way.", "Then she has to tell him this way maybe instead of just saying that she doesn't want it.\n\nTalking is lava", "Sure and so does he. His idea of tasteful does not match hers. Compatibility issue.", "He\u2019s already offered to move his things to a less visible area of the apartment and clean it up a little, which she refused. What she wants is for him to put it all away. She literally made a comment that she doesn\u2019t like his books sharing a shelf with hers. She made herself look a lot better than reality in her post.", "german autocorrect likes capitals. \nI forgot to activate english keyboard aswell now it's fixed my bad", "It starts with something small, then it becomes your friends, family, diet, and once she gets you just how she likes she grows bored and then monkey branches to some new male project. Spend some time on relationship/infidelity survival reedits and you will see it is pretty damn common.", "I think part of the problem is improper terminology. Hentai is porn. What she describes are figurines of scantily clad women, which aren't exactly a rare decoration.", "If your Hobby IS Reading books and your Partner wants to remove all the books cause He hates Reading, would that be fine for you?", "From her admissions on other comments she\u2019s admit that some are video game characters and it\u2019s all constrained to his desk area. If anything it sounds as though she simply doesn\u2019t like anime and is calling anything she doesn\u2019t like or is too sexual for her \u201chentai\u201d which is ignorant and makes her look dumb.", "She was not able to confirm it was indeed soft core porn her own comments sounds like a video game character or a popular anime character \n\nPlus he is reaching for a middle ground doesn\u2019t that means nothing ? Why can\u2019t he have his weird shit in his space  that can\u2019t be barely seen ?", "Let\u2019s break it down, you\u2019re telling me she had NEVER visit his place before moving in? You\u2019re telling me she somehow didn\u2019t know this was how he lived? Why are you moving in with someone if you barely know them? He\u2019s not allowed to have anything of his own up in his own apartment but she\u2019s allowed to decorate however she wants simply because yall deem it more of an \u201cadult\u201d style? \n\nShe can not like it all she wants, but trying to force someone to change how they live simply because you don\u2019t like it is not how relationships work. She either needs to be okay with a compromise or leave.", "I think they just want different things. This is the adult he wants to be. I don't think he's the person she really wants", "Yeah at this point in her comments and learning more info she\u2019s being too controlling. But if its an insecurity thing for her she needs to straight up tell him that", "Spend less time on those subs, it's not good for you.", "Not an equal comparison. She said him watching/reading hentai in his private time is NOT the issue. Books are read by yourself in private, if that\u2019s all he did there wouldn\u2019t be an issue for her", "I saw the pictures she posted and while it's not hentai, it's too sexual for me too. I really think she should just either accept it or leave.", "Yeah idk why she said \u201ccompromise\u201d when she and everyone else is saying let her have his way\u2026he can\u2019t even have a computer background?? Wild.", "And that's exactly why you don't move together so soon ^^", "I have to agree, but after one of our neighbors divorced over cheating me an my wife spent some time thinking about how that could happen. So when one of my daughters told us to check out a reddit we looked into it. Some of it I think is fake, but some of what is there can really make you jaded. Think it is helpful to use as a reference but much of what is there in the comments is scary and toxic.", "Ironically enough? In one of her replies above this... She demanded he remove books because \"she was an avid reader and it was embarrassing for her books to be on the same shelf as his.\"", "So she decides what time of his is private and what is not?", "The statues are not even pornographic mate she posted in her comments freaking wild the take people are taking here", "So right."]}
