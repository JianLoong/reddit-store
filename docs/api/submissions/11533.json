The kicker is that the couple agreed to a $100 ride and I only agreed to a $95 car ride, they still charge me $50, half of the cost of my ride would have been $47.50, so clearly we are in an entirely different agreement, so the \u201coriginal\u201d 2 car situation is null, if that were the case, I\u2019d have to be held to the original $95 not the new $100.

Who cares if it was two fares combined into one, quit being obtuse.", "Further, if it got collapsed into a single fare it is no longer the two reservations. If this is a cab, it should be treated as a single journey and fare, and splitting by person would be de rigueur as if it was a group of friends. \n\nThe hotel or car does not get to seek the benefit of securing \u201ctwo reservations\u201d if they have failed to provide the reserved service.", "Of course you are.  I just don't think \"I haven't seen it so it's not the norm\" is a good argument.  If you didn't know about android would that make the idea \"everyone has an iphone\" a true statement?", ">It makes complete sense\n\nYou declaring that and ignoring all the similar situations where that isn't the case isn't much of an argument.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou say it doesn't affect the cost, but it does.  It wasn't specified how it was split, and you just declare by party is fair.  Two of the largest taxi alternatives, bigger than all regular taxi servies do it opposite of what you say is fair and natural but we can't use information on how every other taxi works to determine what's 'normal and expected'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they sent a van and the other party had 5 people, he'd still have to pay half?  What about a bus with 15 people?  At what point does it just stop \"making sense\"?", "Did they agree in advance to split by reservation?  The OP didn't indicate as much.", "So if the other fare has two people, they should split 50/50. If it\u2019s 15 they shouldn\u2019t. \n\nWhat about 4? 5? 6? \n\nWhy does the other fare having 2 people represent a special situation, distinct from the others in how it should be treated?", "Fine, hotel it is.

Under the OPs proposed scenario he isn't seeking additional rectification from the party who placed him in that situation(which he agreed to) he is seeking it from the couple who had nothing to do with this which makes him the AH in this situation given that he agreed to Car service's proposal to \"make things right\".", "OP was told it would be divided with a second reservation - no comment on by person.

They received two full meals (in this analogy). Are you arguing that each person in the couple only got half as much service as the single guy? \n\nThey got one service as defined by the provider not 2. The service provider did not get into agreement with individuals because they chose not to segment their product that way. The 2 people were one party so they got 1 service.\n\n\n\n>How do you feel about the bus scenario? At what point does the single person have to pay half, regardless of the size of the other party.\n\nThe payment system and responsibility of a single payer is more a reflection of their implied agreement with the service provider based on the what they define the product as than tried directly to what's received. \n\n\nIn an Uber/taxi situation in a *private* ride, the service/product is the whole car and the ride itself. The servicer makes an agreement with defined parties. There could be multiple people, you could fill the car with luggage, you could be by yourself but they are charging the 1 party for one service (unless you're overriding that to indicate multiple parties and split post) Now in op's case, the car service changed the agreement and took away the \u201cprivate\u201d from the product fundamentally changing the service received. From that point on it was an agreement between the servicer and two parties it just happened to include 3 people. \n\nIn a public bus scenario the implied rules are different and doesn't quite work as a 1:1 comparison because based on fare rules \u201cparties\u201d are defined as individuals **BUT** this situation would be more akin to a mother and baby paying one fare vs a single traveler. In this case the service provider defines the mother and baby as one traveling party and therefore it costs 1 fare.", "They didn\u2019t receive two full meals.

Furthermore, I'll state that space and privacy do matter when being transported, that's why first class exists.", "You are technically correct but here is what I don't get. We have the situation that happened as op stated. In an theoretical altnerative, let's say the couple didn't know each other and were combined w OP and all had to split it accordingly. Why should this result in a better scenario for OP?  Why does something completely outside his control affect his booking arragement?\n\nImo, if there are reservations that get combined, then the people who are a couple should have a split cost. The OP should have to pay 1/3, and the responsible company should have to pay the remaining 1/6. If the latter is not practcal (maybe expecting the taxi company or the people who make reservations to be accountable is not practical), then AT LEAST on reddit, everyone should sympathize with OP imo.\n\nIf strangers, Tonya, Frank, and Jack are all mushed into a cab from 3 separate reservations and all have to pay 33 and 1/3, I don't really see why Jack should have to pay for half if Tonya and frank happen to have booked together SIMPLY BC the original reservations were not held up by the company.", "Their dispute is with the payment the driver is demanding, not the other couple.\n\nThe question is if they are an asshole for thinking they should pay less. And they aren\u2019t.", "In one analogy, one person gets double the food as the other two, and therefore pays double.  Are you really arguing that the single person in a taxi got double the service as each of the individuals in the couple?  By that reasoning the more people you share with the better the service you are getting.  God I'd be lucky to pay for half the fare and be jammed into a van with 5 others.", "A little more naying and you could get a horse to ride that OP could retroactively haggle over the price of instead", "It's a terrible analogy. Restaurants charge per person and cars charge per trip, regardless of how many seats are full. The car only had two customers, one just happened to be two people. The couple wasn't paying double what he was. They had confirmed at a staggering five whole dollars more than he had confirmed at.\n\nOP paid $50 instead of the original $95 and they still came to cry about it on Reddit and acted like they got hustled along the way.", "The third person did ride for free.  I'm going to ignore the 95/100 $5 difference here.  A singleton and a couple were each going to get a ride for effectively the same price.  That means the couple got 1 person to ride for free.  This discount stayed when the fare was split 50/50 between the 2 groups.  Each paid 50.  That means the couple paid the same as the singleton.\n\nNext, you talk about agreement.  OP was essentially forced to accept a diminished contract, or missing his flight.  Agreement under duress doesn't mean you lose the right to complain about the new situation, particularly if you feel parts of the new agreement were unfair.", "Lol you paid LESS than what you were originally going to. Stop making yourself into some sort of martyr."]}
