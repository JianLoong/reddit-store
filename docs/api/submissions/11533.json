The kicker is that the couple agreed to a $100 ride and I only agreed to a $95 car ride, they still charge me $50, half of the cost of my ride would have been $47.50, so clearly we are in an entirely different agreement, so the \u201coriginal\u201d 2 car situation is null, if that were the case, I\u2019d have to be held to the original $95 not the new $100.

But, if OP were to sue or file a chargeback for more than $2.50, the company would likely win.", "I mean, that's your opinion, but stating it doesn't make it true.\n\nWhats important here is what was delivered. Not what was ordered.\n\nOP didn't get his private transfer and instead shared a ride with two other people.\nWhy does he pay 1/2 of a ride which three people shared?", "They wanted a private car too, so it\u2019s not on them to only take 1/3rd off for not having a private car. Your issue is with the hotel, not them.", ">It was two fares, combined into one.\n\nI don't think this is a good or fair way to look at the situation.\n\nBoth ordered private transfers, instead were giving a combined transfer. Its normal to pay on a per seat basis for combined transfer. \n\nThe fact that they originally ordered something else is irrelevant. What is delivered is what matters.", "I never was quoted a $100 fare at any point. $50 is an arbitrary charge", "Yup. Trains charge by the seat. You got a train instead of private transportation", "If you can\u2019t see why the example proves OP\u2019s point, then you are the daft one.", "Yeah, and he got 50% off. That\u2019s the compensation. That was established early on", "I agree. It doesn\u2019t matter how many cars the company decided to combine. I paid for a private car and was forced to share it with 2 other people and only got 1/3 the experience, I should only pay 1/3.", "Yes, I do have that documentation and it clearly states my reservation has a passenger number of 1. If the number of passengers per reservation didn\u2019t matter, it would not specify.", "About 45min at 5am", "Yeah, as was the couple. Then they were informed that had changed. \n\nOP can definitely ask for more and provided the company isn\u2019t awful they\u2019ll probably get it, but I\u2019d say they\u2019re only guaranteed $2.50.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make the couple AHs", "What is wrong with you people", "Uncomfortable having to listen to this NJ couple loudly banter about dog sitters the entire 45 minute ride at 5am", "It's two reservations not three admissions! Why does the couple have to further compensate the OP from their share of the total cost of the reservation? You don't think it's an inconvenience for them to have a stranger on board as well?", "Because OP was told it would be split between two reservations. It\u2019s not actually the couple\u2019s fault that they had one other person in their reservation than him, and they originally booked for a private car too, for the two of them. \n\nIf OP has an issue with the lack of private travel and wanting compensation, that should get taken up with the hotel. It\u2019s not on the couple to take 1/3rd discount on their original $100 fee rather than the 1/2 off they arrived on the day expecting.", "Exactly", "Yes, which makes the hotel/driver an asshole for making OP deal with the couple at all", "But they got 2/3 of the car", "Agreed", "Because there\u2019s 13 people and \u2018squashed\u2019 element of that scenario missing. Hyperbole only goes so far", "That wasn\u2019t even a discount. That was just splitting the new fare. In fact, it\u2019s more than 50% of his originally agreed fare.\n\nThe hotel should be embarrassed for how they handled this.", "1/3 of the experience but 100% of the actual purpose of the ride, which is to transport you from the hotel to the airport.", "Checkmate. Hotel should not have made you deal with this shit, and forcing you to have an uncomfortable negotiation with the passengers is the cherry on top.", "The issue is the hotel and the car service. OP shouldn\u2019t have to deal with the couple at all, but the driver only offered an arbitrary and unfair payment term", "I wasn\u2019t told what the split would be ahead of time just that \u201cit will be divided\u201d no more details were given", ">Because OP was told it would be split between two reservations.\n\nHe was told the cost would be divided. The cost divided between people, would normally mean 1/3rd. Certainly if you book a transfer with two friends, i would consider that paying a third would be appropriate. Also if you book a seat on a transfer, you pay on a seat basis.", "Yeah, I mean I'm with you. I don't know what logic school the majority of the people responding went to but it wasn't a good one. You reserved a private ride. If you have to share it with 2 other people it's a three way split", "Not the driver, I doubt they had anything to do with the merging bookings. \n\nI mean the couple also had to deal with OP and wanted a private car. It\u2019s only the hotel I see as truly the AH here.", "Were you going to lay out across those seats if they weren't there?", "This just implies you were all on top of each other. \n\nWhat, you intending to lie across all the seats? \n\nIt\u2019s not a fair argument on making them pay more than you, when they were told they\u2019d be splitting as two reservations. They were also sacrificing a private car\n\nChase it up with hotel if you\u2019ve decided you deserve some sort of compensation. They\u2019re not the AHs in this.", "How are you going to take up more than 1/3 of the car. It's not going to affect you either ways", "Yeah, by $2.50. They could have been shitty and dropped them to $60 each and call it shared ride fees - companies are usually far worse than this, and if either party had kicked up a massive fuss they probably could have stuck with 2 cars each. \n\nExpecting it free is absurd", "Hear hear", "That\u2019s shaky grounds and I think you know it. You were told 2 reservations in one car, you decided they should pay 2/3rds upon seeing them. \n\nThey were also told 2 reservations in one car and split the bill. Not on them. And you should have asked for further clarity if you were going to push a by-the-person split before the day. \n\nChase the hotel if you feel like you deserve something. They didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and the driver was probably told 50/50 split between bookings.", "Divided between two reservations - neither party knew how many people were there before the day. \n\nIf Op was squashed in with too many people, sure. A couple? C\u2019mon.\n\nThe couple will have also been told they are no longer having a private car they were gonna pay $100, but the charge is split between 2 reservations. They\u2019re not AHs for arguing against paying 2/3rds on the day. \n\nWrong people to blow up at.", "That's what's crazy to me. The couple reserved a ride for 100 (supposedly), so they're only paying 50 each. OP reserve a PRIVATE ride for 95. OP suddenly has to share this ride, and split it. Now the couple only has to pay 50 total, so 25 each and OP still has to pay over half of THEIR reservation. This is a shitty way to do business in the part of the can company/hotel/airport and this is exactly why rideshare apps are getting so popular in most cities, over the traditional yellow cabs and black car services. Frankly no passenger is in the right here, as it's not the couples fault the company has a foolish method, but they also could've used a little logic and saw that OP makes sense, even if they're not expressing themselves correctly.\n\nIf two reservations hire two cars, you send two cars, you don't force strangers into a vehicle together like that. It's baffling.", "Maybe. It was 5am and I had to listen to them banter about dog sitters for 45min", "How do they charge for each seat in a train car? By seat or by reservation? Is it more to have a private car", "Nobody was told what the split was ahead of time. I was the only one to ask and was told it will \u201cbe divided\u201d that\u2019s it", "It was 5am and I was hoping to spread out a little in peace. Instead I got to hear 45minutes of banter about dog sitters", ">Expecting it free is absurd\n\nWhat's absurd is that the original schedule and expected service was not received by the customer.\n\nIt absolutely should have been free, and I'd be submitting a charge back for incredibly poor service.", "Exactly. Fact is that both passengers shouldn\u2019t have been forced to settle the bill with each other. They should only have to deal with the driver / hotel. It\u2019s like going out to eat and being forced to settle the bill with the table next to you.", "The couple were going to pay $100 for a private car. OP was going to pay $95 (not a notable difference)\n\nThey were told it would be split between reservations with no information on numbers of people. If a party of 6 showed up against 1 person, sure. But that couple did nothing wrong after being told it would be split between 2 reservations. \n\nThey\u2019re not on a train, not really relevant", "You were the only one to ask? You check that with the couple?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. Pal, it isn\u2019t their fault. As you can see from this thread, plenty of us would have assumed we were paying 50% due to a split on 2 reservations - this is not on them or the driver. \n\nNext time I\u2019d either get a very firm answer on how much you\u2019ll be paying from the hotel, or just insist on a private car and go ahead and pay the whole $95.", "Exactly what I suggested. Charge back for service not delivered", "Nobody was told what the split ratio would be ahead of time. I was the only one to ask and was simply told it would \u201cbe divided\u201d no other details given until arrival at destination", "I don\u2019t begrudge the couple for squeezing out a better discount off me. It\u2019s a rat race out there. The company should have done right by me. We went from private cars to a shared ride. New rules of engagement. A shared Uber is charged by the seat which is essentially what this became.", "You don\u2019t know that. You\u2019ve decided that. Doubt you were with the couple before the journey. \n\nThis is a clutching straws scenario. Complain to the hotel, it\u2019s not the other reservation\u2019s fault", "Yeah, but that\u2019s not what they established so it\u2019s not what you can decide has to be the outcome. \n\nThey weren\u2019t squeezing you, they were paying what they expected. Not on them that you travelled alone. \n\nShould have just ordered a car share to begin with. $95 isn\u2019t worth it for airport travel, in my honest opinion. But I suppose that\u2019s personal preference"]}
