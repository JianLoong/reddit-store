If 5 people had gotten in with you, it still would have been 2 fares.", "Esh. It's 50/50, cause you are one ride and they are one ride. But you should have also only have to pay 47.5, since your professional fare was lower (even if by 5, it's the principle", "Let\u2019s compare this with dinner: If you split food between the 3 of you (you + couple) in a restaurant then everyone should pay 1/3. Your way of arguing would be because you are 3 so it\u2019s fair that everyone pays correct? Well yes and no. Yes that line of argument is correct here but that\u2019s a coincidence. The correct argument is that it\u2019s split 3 ways because the additional person increased the costs, it would be cheaper if it was just you + 1 additional person. That\u2019s why a split of 1/3pp is fair here. \n\nIf we apply this argument to the taxi you can see that them being 2 didn\u2019t change the costs. The company didn\u2019t charge per person but per vehicle. You only needed one vehicle so everyone only pays for half of the service that was ordered. Hence YTA", "I don't think there is a single right answer. I lean towards the 50/50 split as there were originally two cars, which got reduced to one. I think they are right about that part.\n\nI do think you should have paid $47.50, so instead of getting 50% savings you only got a 47% savings.\n\nThis \"The couple leave the car laughing at me\" was 100% your fault.", "This is just petty. You got told you were going to pay less than you originally agreed to, then on the day you got mad when you realised you could try to scrape even more off. \n\nThe couple also found out they were gonna get half off, and then had to deal with an AH telling them they deserve a third off, because they\u2019ve decided they get 2/3rds off what they agreed to. \n\nAnd getting mad over a five dollar difference that actually nets to 2.50\n\nYTA", "NAH. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any assholes here tbf as I can see where you\u2019re coming from and I know many many people who would\u2019ve thought the same way as you. I personally would\u2019ve seen that as a 50/50 thing and wouldn\u2019t have expected to pay any more or less \n\nHowever you were told $95 so I guess you could\u2019ve paid half of that and then they pay the extra $5 for the $100 they agreed to? \n\nEither way, you saved money and I think that\u2019s what you should focus on. You could perhaps contact the company and ask them to review this procedure in the future, 2 reservations combined should be honoured at the lower price imo", "YTA. If two fares are combined which both cost around 100 $ each, how could you come to the conclusion that you only owe a third instead of a half? It obviously doesn't matter how many people are in the car. The two of them would have paid the same price as you, even though they are double the amount of passengers.", "YTA.", "NTA\nThere were 3 people in the car.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You still ended up paying less than what your original fare was. The $2.50 difference is nothing to get worked up over.", "YTA it isn\u2019t a 3 way split, it\u2019s a 2 way. The couple is considered as one reservation group, and you\u2019re the other. If you\u2019re trying to be a stickler, you can order a taxi. YSK You\u2019re the only one that expected the 3 way split, AS the taxi driver himself said 50/50 lol", "NTA you only owe 1/3. Did you pay with credit card?  I also would not have tipped in this case due to the driver screwing you in real time. I would dispute the charge with your credit card and say you did not get the service you contracted", "YTA.  It\u2019s by reservation, not number of people.", "Why would it be split 3 ways?  It's two reservations, you're going to your destination, they're going elsewhere.  Or your both going to the same spot.  It's nice the company cut your fee in half.\n\nYou weren't going out to dinner & drinks with a couple who then wanted to split the bill in half despite eating 2/3 of the food.\n\nYTA and a bit of a weirdo to try and argue this.", "Why are you only splitting it 3 ways?  Surely you should take into the account the weight of each passenger plus their luggage.  That way you can be certain that everyone pays for their specific conveyance to the airport instead of just a notional amount.\n\nYTA.  You were happy to pay 95.  You only paid 50 and you still arrived at the airport safely and on time for your flight.  You are quids in, stop mithering and call it a win.", "NTA. I would have reported that driver.", "NTA. But not for the reason you think. The hotel shouldn\u2019t unilaterally downgrade your service and expect you to pay. You ordered and confirmed private car service. It\u2019s like ordering steak and the restaurant demands you pay for a hamburger they bring out instead. \n\nThey should have comped the whole ride.", " NTA.   It should have been split three ways.

That\u2019s not freebie-worthy", "I think this sums up my sentiments most accurately. I was looking forward to a quiet, private ride and didn\u2019t mind paying for it. Instead, I had to share with 2 other people who loudly bantered about their dog sitters and other crap the entire time. It was certainly a downgrade without my consent.", "There was no specific split determination communicated.

Taxis don\u2019t charge per person, they charge per car. You combined two cars. End of story.\n\nYou also saved $45 on what you originally would have paid by doing so, so why are you complaining? You\u2019re out $2.50 total from what you reasonably could have expected, which sucks, but certainly is not worth even the time you took to write this post. If you proceed with disputing it, you\u2019re literally just trying to get out of paying for a service that you used.
