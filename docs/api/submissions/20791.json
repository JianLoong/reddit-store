But once they try to get her to move she is yelling and crying that she can\u2019t move. She starts to calm down and let\u2019s them move her but as they are she starts moaning and groaning in pain. 2 out of 5-6 paramedics are straight up laughing at her and not like smiling I mean bursting out laughing. I tell him to stop laughing at her grow up and do ur job. They get all tough with me and say this is our job back off. So I said to fuck off.

I'm taking your post at face value and assuming everything you posted here is true. You are NTA and I'd like to say that it is fucked up that you had to advocate for a patient AGAINST the healthcare providers.\n\nI'm a Firefighter/EMT-I and my SO is a Paramedic.\nThe behaviour you have described is incredibly unethical and potentially harmful. Not just to the lady involved but also to other potential patients. A provider should NEVER act in such a manner as to make a patient feel uncomfortable or embarrassed as this can cause them to withhold vital information relevant to their care.\n\nPlease, if you feel comfortable doing so, report this to the department involved. If you are unsure how to do so you may DM me and I will assist you. If the department brushes you off then I would suggest reporting this to your state's licensing board and or the NREMT. \n\nYou might also wish to ask about this over at r/ems.", "You did the right thing.

I used to work in a nursing home and anytime we had to send someone to the hospital they were always so condescending.\n\nCall whatever county you are in non emergency number and report the incident", "NTA.

I'd complain if you can get ahold of their boss or the agency they work for.", "Wait, they sent out 6 paramedics for someone falling in a grocery store? I was LITERALLY hit by an 18 wheeler in car accident and they only sent 1 ambulance with two paramedics \ud83d\ude02", "ESH, assuming this is all accurate.  They shouldn\u2019t laugh at a patient, but you also shouldn\u2019t have gotten in their faces at the moment.  All you did was slow down them getting her to the ER.  If you want to affect anything you need to file a formal complaint with the department.", " NTA. Very unusual behavior on their part. It\u2019s not that paramedics don\u2019t laugh at patients. It 100% happens. Paramedics just usually don\u2019t laugh at patients\u2026 in front of the patient. Huh.\n\nWeird.", "NTA.
