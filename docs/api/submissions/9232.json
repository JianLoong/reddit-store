We don\u2019t like super extravagant weddings, so we plan to keep things simple and frugal. We received money from our families, but we\u2019re using it for a nice honeymoon and using our own bank accounts for the wedding day.\n\nAlthough the title may make it seem otherwise, my step-mother \u201cKim\u201d and I have a good relationship. She gave me a hefty amount of money and asked that I use it for a dress. She said she was very poor at the time of her first wedding and didn\u2019t get to wear a beautiful dress on her big day, and it would mean the world for me to get to wear one. I obliged. I wasn\u2019t planning on spending my own money on an expensive dress, but the amount of money she gave me the opportunity to wear my dream dress. She even took me dress shopping along with my grandmother and helped me pick the most perfect dress. It was a classic fit and flare, and with all the money I was able to get some custom embroidery done. Not only was it a beautiful dress, but it flattered my body perfectly.\n\nA few days after I picked out the dress, however, Kim approached me and asked me if I would like to wear her mother\u2019s old wedding dress from the 1970s, and said she\u2019d give me twice the money she had initially offered to do whatever I pleased with if I agreed. I turned her down. I know it\u2019s a lot of money, but the wedding will be a day I remember for the rest of my life and I really wanted to wear a dress that suits me. The dress in question was puffy with no shape\u2013it would be like getting married in a down jacket.\n\nWhen I said no, Kim explained that she sent me a photo of me in the dress to my step-sister \u201cBea\u201d 25F and Bea had a freakout and said she wouldn\u2019t come to my wedding if I wore that dress. Some background on Bea: our relationship was strained from the beginning. I had better grades than her, dated better looking guys, went to a more prestigious college, got a higher paying job, and I\u2019m now getting married to the guy we both liked in high school while she is still single. Plus, Bea is overweight and very insecure about how she looks, and has always taken out her insecurities on me. Kim said watching me get married to Jim would be hard enough, and I didn't need to wear a dress like that and make it worse.\u00a0\n\nI still refused to wear the old dress. I told her I\u2019m not going to compromise my wedding to coddle Bea\u2019s insecurities. She then asked for her money back and I said no, she gave me the money and the dress is already paid for.\n\nI left it at that but then I got a call from my dad telling me I was rude to Kim and Bea and that I should be able to compromise a small thing about an otherwise perfect wedding for Bea\u2019s sake, or at least pay Kim back the money for the dress. I *did* give her back the leftover money, which was a couple hundred dollars, but I refuse to give back the money I spent on my dress, or wear a different dress.

To me though, and granted I am a random redditor guy, it wouldn\u2019t be worth the trouble and if the dress was returnable I would give her back her money and tell her to stuff it. Because at least for me, it would cast a shadow over the whole day. Which would be her fault but ultimately the day is about happiness, joy and peace, not the specific dress.

It\u2019s your day, Bea should have nothing to do with it.\nBut you really should find a safe place for that dress!\n\nETA: I completely disagree with the people who are telling you to give the $ back. You did exactly what you were told to do with the monetary gift. Your dad and Kim offered you even more $ to not wear the dress. Asking for their $ back is just about punishing you for not giving in to their ridiculous demand. Keep the dress and the money.", "NTA, you can\u2019t just un-order a dress and walk away whole, you would be forced to pay her out of your own pocket at least in part, leaving you with even less money to buy another adequate dress.

The only benefit to Bea is that she gets to giggle under her breath at how ridiculous you look. Does that help her? Does it make her into a better person?

Life\u2019s not fair stepsister needs to understand that she is the only person that is holding herself back. Instead of trying to compete with you she should focus on herself and self esteem. Stepmom is only doing her daughter an injustice if she caters to her tantrum about the dress. And in the process stands to loose you in the future.

The whole speech about how she's super frugal and doesn't like extravagant weddings, *but,* people were just *giving* her money and begging her to spend it, so she *obliged* and got her custom dream dress was a little sus, too.", "Maybe it's just because I'm in a particularly resentful mood lately, but I would only offer to pay her back with the condition that the wedding invite goes away as well.\n\nIf the other daughter means so much that you are willing to fuck up my wedding... Put your money where your mouth is... and fuck up my wedding... for yourself.", "Yeah, but I guarantee it's still not going to fix her longstanding insecurity issues.", "If she has a MOH in her bridal party, and Bea, Kim or people in the family don\u2019t have access to MOH\u2019s house (as the MOH may be family) it may work as you suggest. \ud83d\ude0a", "Ooh so petty- I love it! But really what an awful thing to do- I know it must be so hard for step mum to see her child unhappy and hurting (regardless of whether it\u2019s logical/justified or not) but to put such demands and make your other child unhappy during what is supposed to be one of the happiest times of her life is not right.\n\nOur parents generously funded our wedding and I will never regret the $$$ spent on my dress- even though I know it could have been put to better use. I felt beautiful, just like a princess- what better feeling is there than that!", "I suppose I should have added the sarcasm slash\ud83d\ude09 The whole family, with the exception of OP, are ridiculous.", "Oh, I'm sorry! Lol, long day, I should've realized!"]}
