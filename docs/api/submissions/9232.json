We don\u2019t like super extravagant weddings, so we plan to keep things simple and frugal. We received money from our families, but we\u2019re using it for a nice honeymoon and using our own bank accounts for the wedding day.\n\nAlthough the title may make it seem otherwise, my step-mother \u201cKim\u201d and I have a good relationship. She gave me a hefty amount of money and asked that I use it for a dress. She said she was very poor at the time of her first wedding and didn\u2019t get to wear a beautiful dress on her big day, and it would mean the world for me to get to wear one. I obliged. I wasn\u2019t planning on spending my own money on an expensive dress, but the amount of money she gave me the opportunity to wear my dream dress. She even took me dress shopping along with my grandmother and helped me pick the most perfect dress. It was a classic fit and flare, and with all the money I was able to get some custom embroidery done. Not only was it a beautiful dress, but it flattered my body perfectly.\n\nA few days after I picked out the dress, however, Kim approached me and asked me if I would like to wear her mother\u2019s old wedding dress from the 1970s, and said she\u2019d give me twice the money she had initially offered to do whatever I pleased with if I agreed. I turned her down. I know it\u2019s a lot of money, but the wedding will be a day I remember for the rest of my life and I really wanted to wear a dress that suits me. The dress in question was puffy with no shape\u2013it would be like getting married in a down jacket.\n\nWhen I said no, Kim explained that she sent me a photo of me in the dress to my step-sister \u201cBea\u201d 25F and Bea had a freakout and said she wouldn\u2019t come to my wedding if I wore that dress. Some background on Bea: our relationship was strained from the beginning. I had better grades than her, dated better looking guys, went to a more prestigious college, got a higher paying job, and I\u2019m now getting married to the guy we both liked in high school while she is still single. Plus, Bea is overweight and very insecure about how she looks, and has always taken out her insecurities on me. Kim said watching me get married to Jim would be hard enough, and I didn't need to wear a dress like that and make it worse.\u00a0\n\nI still refused to wear the old dress. I told her I\u2019m not going to compromise my wedding to coddle Bea\u2019s insecurities. She then asked for her money back and I said no, she gave me the money and the dress is already paid for.\n\nI left it at that but then I got a call from my dad telling me I was rude to Kim and Bea and that I should be able to compromise a small thing about an otherwise perfect wedding for Bea\u2019s sake, or at least pay Kim back the money for the dress. I *did* give her back the leftover money, which was a couple hundred dollars, but I refuse to give back the money I spent on my dress, or wear a different dress.

Because at least for me, it would cast a shadow over the whole day. Which would be her fault but ultimately the day is about happiness, joy and peace, not the specific dress.

It\u2019s your day, Bea should have nothing to do with it.\nBut you really should find a safe place for that dress!\n\nETA: I completely disagree with the people who are telling you to give the $ back. You did exactly what you were told to do with the monetary gift. Your dad and Kim offered you even more $ to not wear the dress. Asking for their $ back is just about punishing you for not giving in to their ridiculous demand. Keep the dress and the money.", "NTA, you can\u2019t just un-order a dress and walk away whole, you would be forced to pay her out of your own pocket at least in part, leaving you with even less money to buy another adequate dress.

The only benefit to Bea is that she gets to giggle under her breath at how ridiculous you look. Does that help her? Does it make her into a better person?

Life\u2019s not fair stepsister needs to understand that she is the only person that is holding herself back. Instead of trying to compete with you she should focus on herself and self esteem. Stepmom is only doing her daughter an injustice if she caters to her tantrum about the dress. And in the process stands to loose you in the future.
