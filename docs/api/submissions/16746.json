They were on a road trip and picked them up at one of the hotels they stayed at.  They didn't realize it until after they got home.  From what my wife has described about what SIL and her family have had to do to get rid of them, it sounds terrible.  \n\nA week ago, my wife told me that SIL and her husband need to have their whole house fumigated and need to be out of the house for 48 hours.  She said SIL asked if they could come stay with us during that time since they only live 30 minutes away.  My initial reaction was \"no.\"  My wife had already told me about the hell that SIL and her family was going through to get rid of the bed bugs, I don't want to risk a single chance that they could bring them into our home.  \n\nMy wife said that they had to buy all new clothes and wouldn't bring anything to our house that had any contact with the bed bugs.  She said that the bugs don't live on actual people and since SIL and her family wouldn't be bringing over any clothing or bedding that had bed bugs, we don't have anything to worry about.  She also said that since they picked them up at a hotel, they are obviously wary about spending nights in a hotel during the fumigation.  \n\nI told her that I feel bad for them, but I don't want to take any risk of us ending up in a similar situation.  I don't care if it's even a 1% chance that we get bed bugs too, the things that SIL and her family have had to do to get rid of them sound terrible and to me it's not worth even the slightest risk.

I don't have anything against SIL or her family, but to me it's a simple fact of being absolutely sure we aren't exposing our house and family to the same situation that SIL finds her family in.  \n\nMy wife ended up telling her SIL that they couldn't stay with us, but now my wife is very upset with me.  She feels like the risk was low enough and that SIL and her family would be careful enough not to bring anything to our house that could bring the bed bugs with them.  But the whole situation that SIL's family is in sounds like something that I would never wish on my worst enemy and the only way we can be completely sure is to keep it far away from us.\n\nI do feel bad for SIL and her family, I'm not heartless.  But my wife feels I should have trusted her and her sister to make sure that nothing would come into our house that would put us at risk.  SIL and her family ended up driving 4 hours to stay with some of her husband's family in a townhome that did not have nearly enough room for them.  \n\nNow my wife feels like if we ever need help with anything, there's no way we can ask SIL because we didn't help them with this.", "created_utc": 1683573093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c1lax/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_and_her_family_stay/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also if they had bed bugs on their stuff then they probably need their car checked as well.", "NTA\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling bad, though, maybe you can help pay for the hotel? They\u2019ve probably had an incredible amount of expenses over this mess.", "NTA, it\u2019s your house too and bed bugs are hell to get rid of like you\u2019re saying", "Bedbugs and other household pests travel. They go with you and create new colonies. So, unless you want an infestation, I recommend the family stay at a hotel and just make the circle of contagion smaller and less impactful for all concerned. NTA. This isn't about being generous or gracious. Its about reducing your exposure to household pests.", "NTA! I remember reading a few years ago a lawyer brought bed bugs to the courthouse from his clothes (sorry don\u2019t remember the state) and they shut the courthouse down. They are very hard to get rid of, my cousin had a infestation from a brand new bed she bought and it took a year or two and lots of money replacing beds, furniture, moving etc before they were able to live without them. Once you have an infestation they don\u2019t just live in the beds they get in other furniture like couches, clocks.", "NTA - *years* ago a relative caused a severe bedbug infestation at my grandparents when they stayed for a while, at the same time I lived with them. I *STILL*have a burning hatred for those bugs and get itchy seeing pics or videos.. like *a decade* later. Also moved in with people and found out later they, too, had bedbugs in their room. I would make the same choice you did.. they *ARE* a nightmare to get rid of. They almost made me anemic because I had been donating blood regularly before we figured out they were in my grandparents house. And with the roommates I had to take an unpaid LOA from work for like A WHOLE MONTH until we were cleared as BB free by a pest control company, which we had to pay $1,000 to said company to treat the bugs.  \n\nBB can effect your job, finances, and your health. And can reproduce *asexually*.. aka one female BB on *anything* on them and then you can have a problem.", "NTA that\u2019s literally my worst nightmare. Not taking chances with that!", "NTA.  I had bed bugs once for nearly a year (fumigation company my building was contracted with was garbage).  It was costly (had to buy a new mattress, among other things), quite a few of my good clothes ended up ruined (had to run all fabrics through the dryer on high heat to be sure the bugs were dead), and it took an extreme toll on my mental and physical health (couldn't go anywhere for fear of spreading them, bedroom was basically quarantined off so I worked/slept/lived out of a space that was maybe 12'x6', had to alternate between sleeping on the couch and an air mattress, and I still have scars from the bites). I fully empathize with your SIL's situation but you need to do what's best to keep your household pest free.  Agree with other commenters' suggestion of offering to pay for their hotel stay to help out.", "NTA. At all. IMO, SIL is an absolute asshole for even asking and your wife is terrible for asking. Of course they could bring bedbugs to your house! We aren\u2019t talking about kitchen ants; we\u2019re talking about an infestation of disgusting parasitic insects that burrow under your skin and make you scratch like a meth addict. That is one problem the family needs to shoulder alone, and they never should have asked!\n\nEdit: ok, I confused them with scabies. Bedbugs don\u2019t burrow, but they still bite \ud83e\udd2e", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NAH. I think it\u2019s completely understandable on both sides. I\u2019d feel just as frustrated as the wife if I wasn\u2019t able to help my sister in their time of need, especially if there was someone preventing me from doing so. I also understand OP\u2019s caution. I had to deal with a bedbug infestation a few years back and it\u2019s incredibly inconvenient, incredibly uncomfortable and surprisingly expensive to deal. I can honestly say I\u2019d go to some serious extremes to prevent my family going through that again.\n\nIt\u2019s a frustrating situation for everyone involved but \nthe only AH here are the bed bugs.", "NTA. Sure they bought new clothes and the risk is extremely low they would carry one with them but all it takes is ONE single bed bug for your house to get invaded and that would be a nightmare. I\u2019d tell them to stay at a hotel too - it sucks for them but odds are if they stay somewhere nice they will be just fine and dandy before going home", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t even risk it either! But in the spirit of helping and recognizing how expensive it must be to fumigate your house, perhaps you could offer to cover the cost of the hotel for them? That might be a happy compromise where it wouldn\u2019t cost your SIL money out of pocket and it would t cost you your peace of mind.", "NTA, this is your house too. You have a right to veto anyone staying for any reason.", "NTA", "NAH. Didn\u2019t even finish reading b4 coming down bc I was you OP. I let a friend and her kid stay with me while their place was fumigated and guess who got bed bugs. It ended up costing me over $13,000. Next time I\u2019ll offer to pay for the hotel but sorry no can do at my house again.\n\nEdit: changed from N T A to N A H. I get all sides but I am team OP stand your ground!", "NTA, no way I am risking that nightmare\u2026", "NTA I would not risk bed bugs either", "NTA. That's risky. But I would help them secure a hotel if they needed help with funds, no question.", "NTA at all. I wouldn't risk bed bugs either.", "Have to say NAH. Bedbugs are easy to spread and difficult to eradicate. It can actually be quite traumatic to live with them. We got them years ago when the neighbor across the hall ran a prostitution ring and all the dirty johns brought them in. It was horrible. They get absolutely everywhere and you can't see them until they mature. All it takes is one pregnant female in your house. I'd want to help someone in need but no way I'm going to risk going through that again.", "[deleted]", "Slight YTA. its understandable that you don't want to risk it, but if wife is getting her info from your SIL chances are she is probably right. she has probably been constantly talking with experts while dealing with this situation and likely wouldn't risk infesting your house unless she was 100% sure there was no risk of them spreading any more", "YTA. I'm a nurse and have dealt with bed bugs - she's right, they don't live on people. They're going through hell - HELP YOUR FAMILY.  \n\nIf you're *that concerned*, then buy clothes for them and have them at the house when they show up, have them immediately shower, and put mattress protectors on the bed, or get air mattresses for them. \n\nBut yeah, YTA in a big way.", "Your wife is right. I would never help you no matter what.", ">To me, the only way we can be 100% sure we don't get bed bugs is to not have SIL and her family stay with us.\n\nI totally understand your worries and that you want to prevent getting bed bugs, but reality is, you can always get them from anywhere. (I've had experience with that \ud83d\ude1e)  There is no 100% security to not get bed bugs, unless you lock yourself in for the rest of your life. \n\nYour SIL has the advantage that she knows she needs to be careful, shower, wear new clothes, does everything she can to not infect you. I dare say the chance of you getting infected from her is smaller than if you or your wife sleep in a random hotel.\n\nFact is, your wife wanted to support her family, but you overruled her. You left your SIL hanging when she needed you. She had to sleep somewhere. If you're so afraid she carries bed bugs with her, is it better she carries them to the next hotel where 100 other people are going to sleep? Is it better if her husband's family gets infected?\n\nSomeone had to step up and take her in. Your wife wanted to be that person, but you put yourself first. Your wife is right, you can't rely on family if they can't rely on you. \n\nAnd bed bugs, as horrible as they are, are not a life threatening disease and not the end of the world.

Not to mention their car that they drive to yours and could carry them into yours.  I don\u2019t blame you and to be honest you were being sensible.

Of course maybe you are absolutely fine taking known risks", "Hotels have contracts with pest control agencies for this reason, if they have a guest bring them into the hotel, they can have the service out within the week to get rid of them, so it would be more reasonable to spend the night at a hotel rather than another family members house and infecting a whole HOUSE rather than just a hotel ROOM.", "From terminex\u2019s website:\n\nSo, are bed bugs contagious? No. They don't live on people and can't be directly transmitted from one person to another.
