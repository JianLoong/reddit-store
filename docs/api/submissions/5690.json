I told her she had to go to one of our family members' house, I can't help her.\n\n\nToday, I'm in class and she calls again. I text her that I'm in class and she says that she got kicked out, has nowhere to go, and will be coming to me. I once again stress that it's prohibited and she should go to someone else and put my phone back into my backpack. \n\nAfter class was over, I was headed towards the cantine when my sister suddenly shows up with the security guy. She goes \"that's my sister\" and thanks him for bringing her in while I stand there dumbfounded. She laughs and says that I must have never expected her to do this. I ask her what she's doing here and she says to see me. \n\nWe argue back and forth about the feasibility of taking her in for a solid 10 minutes and my exam was about to start in another 5. I tell her again in a fit of anger that even if it was allowed, I would not let her live with me because she'd take it for granted and never leave and that she should be ashamed of herself for even thinking about jeopardizing my final semester like this. \n\nShe ignores me, puts her luggage and sits there on the grass and says go pass the exam first I'll wait for you. I yell at her not to wait for me and to get the fuck out or I'll be bringing security. She still ignores me and I walk off fuming.\n\nAfter the exam she was no longer there and when I asked security, he said that she was crying when she left and I felt horrible about how I blew her off.

But there's more. If she stays in your dorm, that's going to cause trouble for you, that you do not need. It sucks that she's been evicted, but she needs to sort out her living arrangements, not you. You are well within your right to tell her no.", "NTA. The rules are the rules for a reason. She does not get to change them for her benefit at the risk of you being expelled or left without housing..

Your sister had been evicted - I can only guess there was a good reason for this. You do not have the ability to let her live with you because your dorm doesn't allow guests. More importantly you do not want her to live with you. She is trying to make her problem, your problem. Don't let her. She's 36 - she can figure it out herself.", "NTA - A 36 year old woman should not be moving into to form of a collage she doesn\u2019t attend.  In your case, it\u2019s also against the rules so you had no choice.", "NTA. You\u2019re literally unable to help her. Sure, some of the words were harsh but it\u2019s understandable.

You explained that but she didn't listen.", "NTA. Nothing you could do, you were right not to risk being expelled.", "NTA. She was fully planning on taking advantage of you. She is 36 years old. She should have her crap together enough to find a place to live that doesn't put you in jeopardy.", "NTA. Your sister is being unreasonable and selfish.", "Nope, NTA.  Your sister sounds like a classic narcissist.  You're not obligated to drown in order to save a drowning person.  She's 36 years old, ffs.  She needs to figure her situation out without destroying your prospects.  \n\nDon't feel bad about this for one moment, OP.  If I were you, I'd block her texts and calls for pulling this stunt.", "NTA. At all. \n\nIt\u2019s prohibited.

She chose to ignore that. I\u2019m reluctant to call her an AH because it seems like she\u2019s in a tough place and desperate, but she also needs to listen to no and shouldn\u2019t have shown up and acted like that.", "NTA, she's in a bad way but you literally can't help her without becoming homeless yourself. She's 35, she has options.", "NTA, she wouldn\u2019t take no for answer. That type of person is very hard to deal with, especially when you\u2019re already stressed. Your reaction was not out of proportion.", "NTA. She's selfish and she was going to risk your education for her benefit. What was her backup plan for when you got kicked out and you *both* didn't have anywhere to go? She doesn't have one, because in her mind it's inconceivable that her master plan of staying with you would fail.\n\nNarcissists are the worst, you did the right thing", "NTA.\n\nEven if you could have let her stay with you, you would not have been the asshole to tel her \"no.\" Dorm rooms are intended for students, not grown-ass adults with nowhere to stay, and it would not be fair on your roommate to allow her to stay with you. \n\nBut since it's entirely prohibited for non-students to even enter the building, it's simply impossible.", "NTA\n\nI understand the guilt you are feeling, but there's nothing you could do. She didn't listen to you at all, then made a passing joke about how you didn't expect her to come. Obviously, you wouldn't expect it; you already told her no.", "NTA\n\nShe is expecting you to jeopardize your future for her.\n\nShe has other options. She doesn't like those options, but, she has them.\n\nShe really thought she could strong-arm you into accepting her plan. Good for you that you didn't.", "NTA. She sounds scared and you're the #1 person she trusts and wants to be with, but you may be out of a home too if she stays over. She may or may not understand that, but it just isn't feasible. I'm sorry you two are having to deal with that stress! Take care.", "Very strong NTA. Your sister needs a reality check.", "NTA\n\nI have an morroccan friend (she libes in europe) and went with her this year for about 6 months there. \nAnd believe me I was shocked how entitled they were. \nAnd acting like \"not being able\" for so many things.\nBuuuut when manipulating doesn't work they are able to fix their \"problems\" or when they neefed a place to stay they found suddenly family memberr that before weren't existent or didn't help", "NTA. Your hands were tied.", "You are absolutely NTA here. I don't know what the situation is with your family, but I don't really need to.\n\nYour sister is one year younger than me and the idea that I would ever demand that my baby sister allow me to set up shop in her life when mine wasn't working out is unconscionable to me. Your sister may be about to get a long overdue lesson in adulting, and it's not your job as a person just starting out her own adult life to hold her hand through it.\n\nShe has other people she can reach out to but believes you present the path of least resistance for her. Do not allow her to guilt you over her poor choices.", "NTA.  Talk to her though, try to find a solution.  See if there is any financial ways you could temporarily help her.  I\u2019m not sure about your city regulations but maybe do some research for recent homeless situations, maybe there\u2019s something she can do for being evicted so quickly.   It depends on your country\u2019s laws.", "NTA - She is a selfish person , you say you cant and dont want her there , no is no", "Nta, your sister really needs to get her life together", "NTA especially since you would get kicked out of the dorm or at very least get in serious trouble if you did this and were caught.", "NTA. WTF is this BS. Shit at this point I'd put her out there for the family yourself. She is 36 years old messing with your education situation.", "NTA but it doesn\u2019t end there.  She\u2019s going to need to evoke pity from the next person.  How is she going to tell this story, and who will she tell it to?  \n\nIf you don\u2019t want the next person to think you are awful, you have to think ahead about how to communicate the fact that you cannot have guests in the dorm or during exams.  You also should do this without specifically calling dangerous attention to her situation.  You definitely don\u2019t want to cast her in such a bad light that an older relative won\u2019t take her in and give her the lecture and safe refuge she needs. \n\nMaybe telling a story about the last person to sneak someone in and how much trouble they got into would help.  \n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to look up a shelter or work and stay program, preferably somewhere far from you.  It may be a good idea to text her with that information so you don\u2019t feel uncaring.\n\nAfter this, you won\u2019t be able to turn to her for favors. \n\nThere is a real possibility that she will end up in a dangerous situation.  If she goes missing, you may need to report her as a missing person, because your parents will not be able to do that well.", "YTA and so is she. Taking for granted that her just showing up and expecting to live with you was wrong, so was your reaction. This is your sister going through something traumatic (getting kicked out and not knowing where she are going to live) she turns to you for help. Rather than explaining she can't live with you (according to rules and roommate) but you will figure something out together after school, you go off on her and say even if it were allowed you would not let her.

The delivery the third time was because she just wouldn't listen before", "She didn't pay regularly as in always late...etc. She doesn't have a job and has been depending on our other siblings' help and some guy she's been seeing.", "She's been alive for 13 more years than you so she should at least know she needs to work to get money to pay for rent. She should be looking out for you, not the other way around. NTA and good luck with your studies.", "She came in the middle of your midterms to make a scene and coerce you into letting her stay at your home that isnt even really your home but a school dorm with RULES you have to oblige to, knowing she could get you kicked out. \n\n\nNta", "NTA. It\u2019s prohibited. It\u2019s a solution guaranteed to not work and will only have bad consequences for everyone including her WHILE not working.", "NTA. She is trying to force you into doing something you are not allowed to do. Don't give in, and don't feel bad.\n\nShe's 13 years older than you. You are not responsible for solving her problems.", "NTA. I feel bad for your sister, but you can't risk getting kicked out of the dorm for breaking the rules.", "NTA.

When telling her quietly doesn't get the message across, you have no choice but to get louder. Sister needs to grow up.", "NTA - So she chooses to be unemployed and live off her family and boyfriend\u2019s money to pay her bills and then when that didn\u2019t work out, she comes crying to her little sister??? That is CRAZY. Don\u2019t let her stay with you because she just seems like a user and won\u2019t actually ever leave and will cause problems for you if you break the rules", "NTA.  Some people think the rules don't apply to them.  You were right to say no - really, what else could you have done?", "NTA my Moroccan friend, this is a bit of support you are not reasonably able to give her.", "Keep your boundaries OP. She is obviously not concerned about your future ( causing you so much stress five minutes before your exams !!!) and is only concerned about herself. That is not the behavior of some one who cares about you. Keep that in mind and don\u2019t let her rationalize it by saying she had no other choice. She has many other choices, just not ones that will allow her to get away with such antics without any accountability. Keep those boundaries strong, now and when you move out and live your life. She may turn up again and again in the future if she sees you as a soft gullible fool.", "She has proven herself to be completely untrustworthy. Do not let her drag you into her problems."]}
