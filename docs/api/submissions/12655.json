When the day came she had a great time and loved all her gifts.\n\nThe next day she asked what I\u2019m doing for her birthday. I was confused and asked what does she mean, we had a party yesterday. She said that didn\u2019t count that was a group thing she wanted something just from me. I said we could get some takeout and watch a movie. She wasn\u2019t happy with that and wanted me do something special.

Takeout and a movie sounds absolutely lovely, especially after an evening of socializing at a party the night before.", "NTA \n\nI was going to first ask you how long you've been together then decided not to because no matter if it's been 3 months or 3 years, it's still rude of her to ask for more.", "NTA - how old is she? 16? 17? If she's an adult she needs to grow up and stop acting like a petulant child. She got a nice party with people she cares about and presents. No one has thrown me a party in 20 years. I'd love for someone to be thoughtful enough to throw a birthday party for me.", "Nta - maybe it\u2019s time to reevaluate the relationship", "Nta you need to remind your girlfriend that she's not 16 anymore", "NTA I think big birthdays are for children or for milestones. One birthday party such as you described is plenty.", "NTA\n\nYou already did something, and it makes no matter that it was a group thing.  Whatever happened to \"it's the thought that counts?\"  She's clearly pretty entitled.\n\nGet ready to move on from here, my guy.  If this is just a first taste of things, it only can get worse.", "NTA I get the need to feel special on your birthday, but to ask for more when enough has already been done is kind of childish.  You should've asked her if there was something in particular that she wanted to do, like a dinner in a restaurant or maybe go for a drive.  But honestly, she kind of ungrateful, ngl.", "NTA that's...a wee bit entitled of her. If that's the gift she wanted, then she should have clarified beforehand that she wanted to do something special and intimate with you. If you're still together next year, now you know you can skip the group thing and focus on something intimate. But I kinda suspect she might still have a problem with that...", "Info: Did she plan anything or do a separate thing on your birthday?", "Nta- if something special was important to her she should have told you beforehand. She is an adult who can clearly communicate her needs and wishes. To drop it onto you the day before Is rude. But maybe she did try to hint at it? How did she celebrate your birthday? Maybe she felt like this was example enough\u2026", "NTA but also maybe take out and a movie isn\u2019t exactly romantic. Maybe just something a little more heartfelt and private is all she was looking for from you.", "No she's the ungrateful AH.", "NTA - and I'm sorry, but your girlfriend sounds like she's incredibly high maintenance.", "NTA  I would have thought that one big party would have been enough.  She needs to specify what she wants for the \"something special\" as you are not a mind reader.\n\nYou have to ask, are you just an ATM to her?", "NTA but it also, In my opinion kinda depends on what she means by \"something special\" \nDoes she want you to go do something with her and take her out somewhere nice, etc \n\nBecause \"something special\" could be considered just staying home and having a movie night\nIf she's upset because you didn't do something extravagant for her birthday right after the party for her (which I assume is what's going on) then you're NTA\n\nBut if she's upset bc she wanted to do something with just the two of you (which could easily just be a at home movie night) and got upset bc you didn't think about it I'd say it's reasonable for her to be at least a bit upset,\nI've never dated but I know even if I was dating and  I had a party with all my friends for my birthday I'd wanna just stay home and do something with just the two of us (which again, for me it'd be enough to just have an at home movie night) and it'd be the thought of us doing something together that would make it \"something special\" you suggested takeout and a movie but IF the case with her is the second option maybe she got upset bc you didn't actually think of anything for the two of y'all until she said something and it seemed like a quick thing just put together without any thought to it\n\n Although based on the story and replies, I highly doubt it's the second option, seems more like the first option and her acting pretty spoiled", "I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion, but I understand where your girlfriend is coming from. At the end of the day, this is about how she'd like to celebrate birthdays. \nIt sounds like she gives you an individual gift and plans an individual event for your birthday, and so expects the same on hers. I don't see anything wrong with that. But if this isn't something you want to deal with, maybe you're not meant for eachother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
