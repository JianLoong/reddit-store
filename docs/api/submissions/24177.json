My siblings are understandably upset but have done very little to actually help since they\u2019ve moved away.", "selftext": "So obviously this is a screwed up situation all around. My dad is 58 and a severe alcoholic. I am 22, I have a half sister who is 45 and a full brother who is 24. They live in different states. I did not stay behind to care for my dad but I\u2019ve really been his only support system.\n\nHe has been in and out of rehab, he\u2019s been arrested for public intoxication, public indecency, DUI well over 20 times and numerous other things that would probably break the rules to talk about them. This has been going on as long as I can remember. He is destitute, malnourished and has advanced ARD (alcohol related dementia) which is worse when he doesn\u2019t drink. He can\u2019t work, drive or care for himself in any meaningful way. I\u2019ve been there for all of it while my siblings left a long time ago and have done nothing other than an occasional check.\n\nMy sister arranged for him to be put in a long term care facility (she was not paying for it, state funded) fairly close to me. He was \u201csober\u201d but was caught several times stealing alcohol wipes to either suck on them. I visited him twice and it was like a horror show, I didn\u2019t realize places like this existed outside of the movies. During one of his coherent moments he begged me to take him out. I told him the second he had access to alcohol he\u2019ll drink again. He said he knew but he\u2019s ready to die and he\u2019s at peace with it.\n\nI talked it over with my husband and we hired a specialist to examine my dad and he said if he drinks he has maybe 6 months left. We did a quick remodel on our house so my dad will have easy access to a bathroom and we said we will buy him a 30 pack of cheap beer a day and he can stay with us until he\u2019s gone.\n\nYes it suck\u2019s but on one hand he has his family, he\u2019s not covered in bed bugs, hes clean and has entertainment. He\u2019s not stealing to fund his habit, he\u2019s not bothering the public and he won\u2019t get arrested. \n\nMy siblings think that he was going to get better in the facility and think Ive signed him up for a death sentence. I told them that they are welcome to move him to a facility closer to them so they can be the ones to visit him and see his food covered in roaches and his baths being wiped down with chemicals. My sister said she can\u2019t because of her \u201creputation as a real estate agent\u201d (my stomach hurt I laughed so hard) and my brother said he doesn\u2019t want his kids to see their grandpa like that. Both ridiculous excuses but they insist on being angry with me when I\u2019m the one who\u2019s borne all the stress and heartache of seeing this in person.\n\nTo me this allows a man who has made some terrible choices in his life the ability to at least not linger in some hell hole for the next 10 years and die as crappy as he lived\u2026but at least on his own terms.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691498733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lh7z9/aita_for_moving_my_alcoholic_dad_in_with_me_to/", "score": 334, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's what he's going to do. \n\nMy dad's parents spent hundreds of thousands getting him rehab for heroin. Forced sobriety never ever works. It never sticks. He the same day of release always 'relapsed'. I say it that way, as in my mind it's not a relapse if sobriety is forced and they knew as soon as they get out they'll be back on. He didn't relapse he continued his addiction. \n\nThe last time they got him thrown into a rehab was the last time. See, he got out, got picked up by his dealer who gave him heroin and dropped him off down the road, my dad being so desperate to shoot up, decided hey the rehab has a big carpark and shit to hide behind like the dumpsters. So he went there to shoot up. \n\nHe was found dead hours later by one of the rehabs workers. He overdosed next to the dumpster in a puddle of bin juice and his own filth.

Still the same addict when 'sober'. Still the same addict when released from treatment time and time again. The money to pay for this, is doing nothing to extend his life, it actually risks it even more, dad getting out and drowning in a bottle of vodka could well kill him that first day. \n\nYour dad is cognisant of what he wants. Realistically if he has 6mths to live, a sober life for him is extremely bleak with medical issues and the like he won't even be able to pay to have treated and be sober in pain until he does die. He wants to die on his own terms, he seems to have accepted his mortality and he's willing to shut away and do his thing with some supervision and stop wasting others money on treatment. \n\nThey don't like it, but they also aren't there and helping and are refusing to.

I did not stay behind to care for my dad but I\u2019ve really been his only support system.\n\nHe has been in and out of rehab, he\u2019s been arrested for public intoxication, public indecency, DUI well over 20 times and numerous other things that would probably break the rules to talk about them. This has been going on as long as I can remember. He is destitute, malnourished and has advanced ARD (alcohol related dementia) which is worse when he doesn\u2019t drink. He can\u2019t work, drive or care for himself in any meaningful way. I\u2019ve been there for all of it while my siblings left a long time ago and have done nothing other than an occasional check.\n\nMy sister arranged for him to be put in a long term care facility (she was not paying for it, state funded) fairly close to me. He was \u201csober\u201d but was caught several times stealing alcohol wipes to either suck on them. I visited him twice and it was like a horror show, I didn\u2019t realize places like this existed outside of the movies. During one of his coherent moments he begged me to take him out. I told him the second he had access to alcohol he\u2019ll drink again. He said he knew but he\u2019s ready to die and he\u2019s at peace with it.\n\nI talked it over with my husband and we hired a specialist to examine my dad and he said if he drinks he has maybe 6 months left. We did a quick remodel on our house so my dad will have easy access to a bathroom and we said we will buy him a 30 pack of cheap beer a day and he can stay with us until he\u2019s gone.\n\nYes it suck\u2019s but on one hand he has his family, he\u2019s not covered in bed bugs, hes clean and has entertainment. He\u2019s not stealing to fund his habit, he\u2019s not bothering the public and he won\u2019t get arrested. \n\nMy siblings think that he was going to get better in the facility and think Ive signed him up for a death sentence. I told them that they are welcome to move him to a facility closer to them so they can be the ones to visit him and see his food covered in roaches and his baths being wiped down with chemicals. My sister said she can\u2019t because of her \u201creputation as a real estate agent\u201d (my stomach hurt I laughed so hard) and my brother said he doesn\u2019t want his kids to see their grandpa like that. Both ridiculous excuses but they insist on being angry with me when I\u2019m the one who\u2019s borne all the stress and heartache of seeing this in person.\n\nTo me this allows a man who has made some terrible choices in his life the ability to at least not linger in some hell hole for the next 10 years and die as crappy as he lived\u2026but at least on his own terms.\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They will stop eating and become bedridden, needing supervision and help with basic bodily functions like cleaning urine/feces and turning to prevent bed sores. Have a plan for what you will do when that happens. Ask his doctor or a social worker for information on charity Hospice services, which could go a long way even starting now to keep him comfortable \n\n* If your dad still has any decision making capacity, please consider asking his doctor or a lawyer about a Medical Power of Attorney form. This becomes important during end of life decisions, especially if there is disagreement among children who are often legally given equal weight. If your dad is unable to make such decisions for himself however, ask a lawyer about obtaining legal guardianship.\n\n* If you are able to secure medical decision making power, look into local laws about Out of Hospital Do Not Resuscitate orders in case you find him near death in your home to prevent traumatic resuscitation efforts", "NTA.

I would also say 30 beers a day seems excessive. Especially where he's not been drinking, I think you could lower that number significantly.
