My siblings are understandably upset but have done very little to actually help since they\u2019ve moved away.", "selftext": "So obviously this is a screwed up situation all around. My dad is 58 and a severe alcoholic. I am 22, I have a half sister who is 45 and a full brother who is 24. They live in different states. I did not stay behind to care for my dad but I\u2019ve really been his only support system.\n\nHe has been in and out of rehab, he\u2019s been arrested for public intoxication, public indecency, DUI well over 20 times and numerous other things that would probably break the rules to talk about them. This has been going on as long as I can remember. He is destitute, malnourished and has advanced ARD (alcohol related dementia) which is worse when he doesn\u2019t drink. He can\u2019t work, drive or care for himself in any meaningful way. I\u2019ve been there for all of it while my siblings left a long time ago and have done nothing other than an occasional check.\n\nMy sister arranged for him to be put in a long term care facility (she was not paying for it, state funded) fairly close to me. He was \u201csober\u201d but was caught several times stealing alcohol wipes to either suck on them. I visited him twice and it was like a horror show, I didn\u2019t realize places like this existed outside of the movies. During one of his coherent moments he begged me to take him out. I told him the second he had access to alcohol he\u2019ll drink again. He said he knew but he\u2019s ready to die and he\u2019s at peace with it.\n\nI talked it over with my husband and we hired a specialist to examine my dad and he said if he drinks he has maybe 6 months left. We did a quick remodel on our house so my dad will have easy access to a bathroom and we said we will buy him a 30 pack of cheap beer a day and he can stay with us until he\u2019s gone.\n\nYes it suck\u2019s but on one hand he has his family, he\u2019s not covered in bed bugs, hes clean and has entertainment. He\u2019s not stealing to fund his habit, he\u2019s not bothering the public and he won\u2019t get arrested. \n\nMy siblings think that he was going to get better in the facility and think Ive signed him up for a death sentence. I told them that they are welcome to move him to a facility closer to them so they can be the ones to visit him and see his food covered in roaches and his baths being wiped down with chemicals. My sister said she can\u2019t because of her \u201creputation as a real estate agent\u201d (my stomach hurt I laughed so hard) and my brother said he doesn\u2019t want his kids to see their grandpa like that. Both ridiculous excuses but they insist on being angry with me when I\u2019m the one who\u2019s borne all the stress and heartache of seeing this in person.\n\nTo me this allows a man who has made some terrible choices in his life the ability to at least not linger in some hell hole for the next 10 years and die as crappy as he lived\u2026but at least on his own terms.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691498733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lh7z9/aita_for_moving_my_alcoholic_dad_in_with_me_to/", "score": 1354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's what he's going to do. \n\nMy dad's parents spent hundreds of thousands getting him rehab for heroin. Forced sobriety never ever works. It never sticks. He the same day of release always 'relapsed'. I say it that way, as in my mind it's not a relapse if sobriety is forced and they knew as soon as they get out they'll be back on. He didn't relapse he continued his addiction. \n\nThe last time they got him thrown into a rehab was the last time. See, he got out, got picked up by his dealer who gave him heroin and dropped him off down the road, my dad being so desperate to shoot up, decided hey the rehab has a big carpark and shit to hide behind like the dumpsters. So he went there to shoot up. \n\nHe was found dead hours later by one of the rehabs workers. He overdosed next to the dumpster in a puddle of bin juice and his own filth.

Still the same addict when 'sober'. Still the same addict when released from treatment time and time again. The money to pay for this, is doing nothing to extend his life, it actually risks it even more, dad getting out and drowning in a bottle of vodka could well kill him that first day. \n\nYour dad is cognisant of what he wants. Realistically if he has 6mths to live, a sober life for him is extremely bleak with medical issues and the like he won't even be able to pay to have treated and be sober in pain until he does die. He wants to die on his own terms, he seems to have accepted his mortality and he's willing to shut away and do his thing with some supervision and stop wasting others money on treatment. \n\nThey don't like it, but they also aren't there and helping and are refusing to.

I did not stay behind to care for my dad but I\u2019ve really been his only support system.\n\nHe has been in and out of rehab, he\u2019s been arrested for public intoxication, public indecency, DUI well over 20 times and numerous other things that would probably break the rules to talk about them. This has been going on as long as I can remember. He is destitute, malnourished and has advanced ARD (alcohol related dementia) which is worse when he doesn\u2019t drink. He can\u2019t work, drive or care for himself in any meaningful way. I\u2019ve been there for all of it while my siblings left a long time ago and have done nothing other than an occasional check.\n\nMy sister arranged for him to be put in a long term care facility (she was not paying for it, state funded) fairly close to me. He was \u201csober\u201d but was caught several times stealing alcohol wipes to either suck on them. I visited him twice and it was like a horror show, I didn\u2019t realize places like this existed outside of the movies. During one of his coherent moments he begged me to take him out. I told him the second he had access to alcohol he\u2019ll drink again. He said he knew but he\u2019s ready to die and he\u2019s at peace with it.\n\nI talked it over with my husband and we hired a specialist to examine my dad and he said if he drinks he has maybe 6 months left. We did a quick remodel on our house so my dad will have easy access to a bathroom and we said we will buy him a 30 pack of cheap beer a day and he can stay with us until he\u2019s gone.\n\nYes it suck\u2019s but on one hand he has his family, he\u2019s not covered in bed bugs, hes clean and has entertainment. He\u2019s not stealing to fund his habit, he\u2019s not bothering the public and he won\u2019t get arrested. \n\nMy siblings think that he was going to get better in the facility and think Ive signed him up for a death sentence. I told them that they are welcome to move him to a facility closer to them so they can be the ones to visit him and see his food covered in roaches and his baths being wiped down with chemicals. My sister said she can\u2019t because of her \u201creputation as a real estate agent\u201d (my stomach hurt I laughed so hard) and my brother said he doesn\u2019t want his kids to see their grandpa like that. Both ridiculous excuses but they insist on being angry with me when I\u2019m the one who\u2019s borne all the stress and heartache of seeing this in person.\n\nTo me this allows a man who has made some terrible choices in his life the ability to at least not linger in some hell hole for the next 10 years and die as crappy as he lived\u2026but at least on his own terms.\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even in a good, clean, caring facility, he would not be expected to have that much time left, because you don't get this far down the alcoholism road without seriously damaging your body. Taking him in and taking care of him as best as possible is a kindness, not an AH move. Please be aware though that this is going to be far harder than you probably thought going into it.

Those places are horrible and it sounds like your father has been wanting to die for a while. Speak with a chemical dependency specialist for guidelines on setting boundaries. I worked in transitional housing for a while that would allot alcohol to our dependent clients, for example they would sign a contract and be allotted one beer in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one at night, the rest of the time it was locked up. This is with the agreement that if they brought in outside alcohol they would go right back.  The CDP will look at how to navigate this because when someone is this far along they absolutely cannot quit cold turkey.

Your siblings are doing NOTHING. Your dad is a lifelong addict, and you know he's not going clean. You're taking better care of him than they ever would, and your dad has made the decision to trust you to continue to care for him in his last months. Yes, addiction is scary and dangerous, but there's already a number on his days.

Alcohol isn\u2019t like other drugs and as long as he\u2019s been a full blown alcoholic? He doesn\u2019t stand a chance.

I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that for my father (addict) but if the situation were like this and someone else did, I\u2019d thank them profusely.

Not just detox, but solid mental health support to go with it.  My uncle  drinks to forget having to identify his mom (my grandma) who got hit by a car.

She never lived in a city, and it was the first time she was in one, jaywalked and got killed.  \n\nHe also lives with the guilt of not telling my grandfather that the woman he was marrying (so he could keep custody of his daughters) beat the shit out of her girl children and molested her boys.  She lived in the same apartment building as my uncle and he heard the abuse every day\n  Early 60's, CPS didn't care, unless it was a man raising daughters alone.\n\nAnyway we won't make him sober up.

You should never regret your choice.", "I would have done this for my father if I\u2019d had the chance. I think we could have had some really wonderful moments in the final months. He was \u201can alcoholic\u201d because he was horribly depressed, and he was horribly depressed because he understood the world too well and was genuinely far too Good for the rest of us. It wasn\u2019t his fault. Ultimately he was probably the best person I knew, and the world destroyed him and drove him to awful places.

You should be very proud of yourself.", "NTA\n\nI think you are doing the best you can by bringing him into your home, ensuring he is well taken care of, and accepting that as long as he does not want to stop drinking, he will drink.\n\nYou mention he has severe dementia, and also a 30 pack of beer a day. If I can offer any suggestion, it would be to rethink such a massive amount of beer. What you could aim for is the minimum amount to keep him living with you, not the maximum he can pour down his throat in 24 hours. What has me a little worried is that you seem to have an incentive for him to go asap, and you are not making decisions to truly reduce harm.", "NTA. You are caring for him in the best way you can plain and simple.", "NTA and I wish you, yiur partner and your dad the best in the time to come.\n\nThis was a situation that was discussed in my family too in regards to an alcoholic with dementia if his wife who had cancer died. We ended up pretty much ready to do the same solution as you plan to, but it ended up working out differently for other reasons.", "NTA \n\nThere are no good options in a situation like this. But you\u2019ve chosen to give your dad agency over his own body and life, and to be more comfortable in his remaining time.", "Wow. Definitely NTA. He's lucky to have you", "NTA. Good luck.

We just took this path a year ago with a family member so I empathize with your situation.", "Your father is so incredibly fortunate to have you in his life.\n\nYou are so NTA I'm not sure I can adequately state it for you.\n\nYou are doing the right thing. Go to bed with that thought, when you wake up during the night repeat it to yourself, when you get up in the morning say it again.", "NTA - you're giving him the dignity to go out on his own terms. Is it self-destructive yes, he probably also needs help, but if his experience at the facility was tortuous, then let him make his decisions on how he wants to live like an adult.\n\nYour siblings are pathetic virtue signallers, if they really wanted to help your dad, they would've done more to make his stay at the facility bearable.", "Youre NTA. I would highly recommend you attend Al Anon or meet with a therapist while you cope with this. Watching a parent drink themself to death will be difficult and I think you will need the support. It's a rough road and you have my sympathy.", "My father is the same. 10 years ago the Dr told family he had months to live. He's still alive 10 years later. Me personally, I don't have anything to do with him. He was hardly in my life growing up, so I've never close to him. I had my parents who raised me (my dad since I was 3, who passed away unexpectedly 18 years ago and my mom who I'm very close to). \nBack to my father's family, my aunt who I talk to about one a month,  informs me all the time about my father's health conditions. She knows how I feel about him (I care, but yet I don't care, if that makes sense). I have told her I don't care what happens, where he ends up as long as I don't have to pay for it. She informed me that she put him into a Catholic Charities that has sober living and drunk living \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Whatever. He has a roof over his head, he gets fed 3 times a day and he spends his social security on alcohol. The Dr is shocked he is not dead yet. \nSorry this is long, but just because the Dr says your dad has 6 months to live, he might live a lot longer than that. You might be taking care of your dad for many more years. \nIf this starts to put a strain on your personal life and your family, you might want to look into something long term. The Catholic Charities facility that my father is at is supposedly really nice. My aunt goes there at least twice a month and has never seen any issues.", "NTA-My parents had a neighbor that would come help out sometimes with various things.  Also would talk to my dad and play with the family dog.  He drank and smoked his SS check every month but kept just enough to feed himself and pay his minor bills.  He was a good person that didn\u2019t have a mean or abusive attitude.  He of course died due to heart issues related to his drinking but no one ever would have told him to stop because that is how he coped with the losses and issues he had with life.  No shame just living with the consequences of the choice of how he wanted to live and die.  \n\nMay your father have the same peace in his last days.", "NTA \nYou are the one stuck in this situation. Your father does not want to and can not leave drinking. Only thing you can ensure is a little dignity for him in his last days and you are doing everything you can.", "NTA. It\u2019s his life and his death. I think you did a pretty amazing thing. \n\nI knew someone with 5 siblings yet he was the only one to care for their ailing father for years. Even when he was hospitalized he was the only one visiting. Eventually his father was alive only because of the machines and since he had medical POA he asked his siblings if they wanted to see him before he pulled the plug. All of a sudden everyone had an opinion and told him he was cruel and giving up and how could he. So he pulled the plug and went back to his life. Some people just suck when it comes to dealing with dying family members. Tell them to come get him or pound sand.", "My mom was like this with my grandfather; she moved him into her house, gave him the second suite with an attached bathroom and basically took care of him when he really didn't have anything more to give.  My grandma passed away and while my grandfather never drank, he didn't have anyone who could take care of him and the house was a disaster thanks to Hurricane Maria.  So my mom brought him into her home.\n\nNTA.  You are doing what you can by this man and yeah it sucks, but at least he will be comfortable and as you said, go out on his own terms.  This makes your a saint.", "NTA. Awful situation. But if the place is horrible, and he doesn't want to get better (and let's be honest - is a bedbug-infested shithole really a place to increase your desire to survive?), then you are at least giving him some compassion. I hope you and your husband aren't too badly affected by it all.", "NTA, I'd say as an alcoholic's daughter. if he wants to drink himself to death, it's ultimately his choice. I 'll tell you my story. My father quit smoking cigars in his mid 30s and drinking in his mid 40s. Died of a lung issue at 59, it was genetic and not from smoking. Life goes as it goes, but he was given 5 years to live almost 10 years before he finally passed away. He could've kept drinking, it never interfered with his family or work, was quite light, and been more relaxed and still died when he died. Sounds like your dad's alcoholism is way past the final stage, with the dementia and all, he'll be pretty miserable the rest of his life if he quits drinking and there's no guarantee he'll live long anyway. the alcohol has already done a lot or irreparable damage which would severely impair his quality of life, even sober. it's heart-breaking i know, but in a way you're doing him an enormous favour giving him the chance to go out on his own terms. I wish you all the courage!", "Sorry for what you are going through brother", "I read *Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End* by Atul Gawande and there's a lot in there about end of life care that supports your outlook here. You are doing the best you can in a difficult situation, and I wish the best for all of you.", "NTA. you\u2019re doing the best thing you can possibly do in this situation and i commend your strength. even if he decided to get sober the extreme long term alcohol abuse would cause life threatening withdrawal and based off the ARD he will probably pass anyway. thank you for giving him a kind and peaceful place to live out the rest of his days", "NTA \u2014 what you\u2019re doing is beyond compassionate.  I can\u2019t imagine seeing someone you love slowly kill themselves.  But you\u2019re giving him a safe space to do it.  Your siblings are also NTA for their well-intentioned thoughts \u2014 but they\u2019re not living it.  \n\nI really really hope you\u2019re able to get them to see his side of things and how you\u2019re helping before his life ends.  I am afraid they will be upset or downright hate you for what you\u2019re doing for him.\n\nGood luck with it all.", "NTA \n\nI really commend you for your compassion. It\u2019s such a hard decision to make but you see the reality of the situation and just want to make him as safe and comfortable as possible. \n\nYou family clearly do not understand it and they might not forgive you but that\u2019s ok too. Know that you are doing right by him, if even the circumstances feel tragic.", "my wife watched her brother die in a hospital of liver and kidney failure.  It was not easy to watch.  Maybe you can get him on an advance directive for no life support.", "ESH everyone sucks here. Like so much. Oh my god. SO much. Except your brother, it absolutely IS a valid issue for him to not want his kids exposed to that.\n\nYou are very young and someday may regret helping your father unalive himself. You gave up on him. So why would he not give up on himself?\n\nGive us an update when he croaks, I guess", "NTA- but also no one really is. I dont think you should be asking this here. \n\nYou need to see a therapist before you sign on to do something like this. It's 1 thing for your siblings or your dad to be judging. You will have to live with this for the rest of your life and you are pretty young to be making this decision that could essentially kill someone. Just make sure you're thinking about yourself too during this time. \n\nAlso a 30pack of cheap beer a day is still going to add up. Living with your dad is going to be tougher than you think. I would recommend posting this or going to a support group for Adult Children of Alcoholics or similar groups.", "You are an angel.  You are giving him his last wish.  \nI'm so sorry, but you're doing the right thing.  \nNTA", "So clearly NTA. I'm so sorry for the choices you've been given, there doesn't seem to be a good one. But yours is filled with kindness and respect. Respect for your father and for the people who need to be protected from him. Good luck", "NTA. At this point, you are doing in home hospice care. The focus is on having your father live his last days on his own terms, and to be treated with respect. It's no longer about managing the disease.", "NTA. You\u2019re giving your father a peaceful end to his life, surrounded by family. You\u2019re really brave for doing this and shouldn\u2019t really care what your siblings say since they don\u2019t want to be involved in your father\u2019s life.\n\nI hope you and your partner and family find peace, and know deep down in your heart that you did the right thing to the best of your abilities. Be proud of that.", "NTA. I'm in favour of euthanasia as well, so while drinking oneself to death maybe isn't what most people would call dying with dignity, between the two choices here I think it is the more dignified one, and the one I would prefer as your father. It's unconventional, but the more human thing to do, and I applaud you for making the sacrifice.", "NTA. BUT...you are signing up for a lot of grief. Have you ever attended an AlAnon meeting? Because I think you need to talk with someone. This is not your responsibility and this could your immediate family and is hurting your relationships with your siblings who will be around long after your Dad is gone. Also, I have found that people can outlive estimates by sometimes years. This is a huge burden.", "NTA, but I'm only judging your siblings for criticizing your decision.   They're wrong for that.\n\nThere's a lot of judgment in your post and in these comments of your siblings being hands off with your dad that I don't agree with.  They aren't required to remain close with a raging alcoholic who is making it everyone else's problem too.  I would have cut this guy out of my life somewhere before the 20th DUI.  They shouldn't be telling you what to do, but it is quite reasonable that they want little to do with him.  I wouldn't want him around my kids either.", "NTA.  \n\nWhen my paternal grandmother died, my grandfather was crushed.  They were heavy drinkers (I assume alcoholics, but high-functioning, and it's not my place to diagnose them). My grandfather retired and started spending his days at the local tavern.  Eventually, we was unable to get back and forth, so just sat in his easy chair and drank day and night.  He refused medical attention and intervention.\n\nAfter about a year, my father (who had been divorced form my mother for a few years) and his new wife moved into the big family house to \"take care of him.\" He and my grandfather drank for about four years when my grandfather finally died.\n\nPeople were furious that my father let that happen.  My position has always been that my grandfather was doing what he wanted to do:  drink himself to death.  He had no interest in living without my grandmother.  My father had moved in, drank with him, but also maintained the house, cooked three meals each day, got him up and down the stairs, and generally took care of him.\n\nPeople get angry when a family member dies and blaming someone else is a common reaction.  None of my aunts and uncles lifted a finger.\n\nYour efforts are not AH-ish.", "Late to the party but OP you're the same age as me when I lost my father to alcohol. We tried as a family so hard. But nothing worked. My dad and I lived with gran, his mum. No one outside the household ever understood. But we were there not happily, trust me many nights he was locked out. He stole, he lied. But it was better he died knowing someone cared not on the streets, dirty and alone. Whatever he did thats my dad. My conscious is clean. Its been over 10 years and not once have I questioned it. Make sure you've got house insurance. You're doing amazingly Op incase anyone hasnt told you lately. This too shall pass and you'll be stronger for it.\n\nYou're NTA you've got a heart of gold. Good luck Op", "NTA \nI have so much respect for you and your partner. Enabling him to drink himself to death versus leaving him in that horrendous place to prolong his life in hell is not an easy decision. With such a dilemma most people would choose the one less taxing on themselves - ie, leaving him in the facility, out of sight. Visiting less. Trying not to think about it. Instead you have chosen to do something not everyone will understand or approve of at the expense of your own relative comfort. I truly admire you. \n\nI would just like to add i understand the need to provide him with alcohol. At least that way he will only be hurting himself, rather than potentially hurting others in pursuit of it. \n\nYour selfless, compassionate pragmatism is truly awe inspiring. I hope you survive the next few months without it taking too severe a toll on you.", "NTA, but please consider a few things:\n\n* There is no guarantee someone will last the amount of time the doctor prognosticates. He could pass next week, he could be alive in 5 years. Please be sure you're ready for either possibility\n\n* Dementia often progresses to the point that the person needs full time care before they die. They will stop eating and become bedridden, needing supervision and help with basic bodily functions like cleaning urine/feces and turning to prevent bed sores. Have a plan for what you will do when that happens. Ask his doctor or a social worker for information on charity Hospice services, which could go a long way even starting now to keep him comfortable \n\n* If your dad still has any decision making capacity, please consider asking his doctor or a lawyer about a Medical Power of Attorney form. This becomes important during end of life decisions, especially if there is disagreement among children who are often legally given equal weight. If your dad is unable to make such decisions for himself however, ask a lawyer about obtaining legal guardianship.\n\n* If you are able to secure medical decision making power, look into local laws about Out of Hospital Do Not Resuscitate orders in case you find him near death in your home to prevent traumatic resuscitation efforts", "NTA. This is a really hard situation where there's not really a good option available, so I'm not going to label anyone an AH. \n\nOne thing I would say is that there's a difference between saying \"let's move him into our home so he kills himself\" vs \"let's move him into our home so he can be treated with dignity, even though we know that means he will most likely kill himself drinking.\"  The latter seems ethical, the former sounds quite questionable. I would also say 30 beers a day seems excessive. Especially where he's not been drinking, I think you could lower that number significantly. Maybe speak to a harm reduction expert to figure out what a reasonable number would be. Unless you are actually trying to kill him as soon as possible, in which case I will say I think you are morally and ethically wrong, but not an AH.  I feel for you. It's a terrible situation to be in.", "NTA- you sound like a realistic person that\u2019s been put it a horrible situation. Such a sad story for everyone involved. I truly wish you peace.", "NTA- I feel incredibly sorry for you, especially when all the pressure is pretty much only put on you and your husband. \n\nIt seems like your dad no longer wants to live and is content with that thought (although it sounds morbid). The facility and other options also don\u2019t seem to be much use and can sometimes be pretty bad places so I understand not wanting to keep him there. \n\nI think I would\u2019ve made the same decision as you, and kept him in the house and provided him the alcohol he needed to keep him away from crime. \n\nHowever, if this becomes a huge burden on you and you feel it is ongoing and you cannot live with it, then I feel you need to do what\u2019s best for YOU and perhaps send him back to a care facility, don\u2019t let your life be destroyed as well", "You deserve a reward for being the only person in your family willing to stick up for your dad even though everyone else has given up on him long time ago. Yes he might be dead in a few months time but so could you, I or anyone else, we don't know how long we have left all. We can do is make what time we have left as precious as we can, and you're doing that for your dad, I hope your dad obviously has longer than a few months but whatever time he does have left at least he's with you, happy, clean and safe and that's what's most important.", "NTA, I cared for 2 of my grandparenta to the last moment. I can't fault you. I've seen illness ravish my grandparents, that I used to pray that they go before it gets too bad. I felt horrible for my prayer but I saw how much they were suffering.

I am sorry you had to make this choice. Much love and prayers!", "NTA. But understand that this is going to be extremely hard. This will forever change your relationship with your siblings. Get yourself into therapy. Look into home health now before you have to scramble. Look into things like a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and Medical Power of Attorney. Make sure that he has a will on file. Get all of the documents filed now while you still can, and make sure that these things are ironclad so that your siblings can't swoop in and either contest them or make changes. The road ahead of you is going to be difficult. He may well pass in his sleep, but it may well be a road of unimaginable suffering, and you need to get ahead of it now.

I can't blame your brother for not wanting his children to see him like that--seeing your grandparent in the final stage of life can be very upsetting and traumatizing (based on personal experience).\n\nWhat I CAN blame them for is never coming in person to check in on him. For your sister picking the cheapest possible place the state will pay for. For assuming he was fine there, even with your reports. For letting that hope interfere with making the best decision for his well-being and only thinking of themselves. For your sister putting her reputation above her own father.\n\nYou spent your own money to modify your home and set him up to let him die somewhere clean and peaceful on his own terms, where he is safe and has edible food. Where he isn't having to steal or wandering drunk in public. This is a final act of compassion.", "NTA at all. What you\u2019re doing is incredibly compassionate and treating him like a human. Yes its difficult but if this is what he wants, who is anyone to stop him? At least this way he\u2019s in a loving and safe environment and will be at peace. I commend you, I really really do.", "NTA. \n\nGood luck, and my thoughts are with you over the next few months.", "It's not assisting suicide but it's allowing things to happen without the luxury of blame to the state/ not being aware/ feigning ignorance...etc. It's likely to cause hurt because most won't be able to accept this.

But honestly I think you are providing a mercy.", "NTA\n\nThis feels like assisted suicide to me if I'm keeping it real. I almost respect the fact of how at peace your dad is with his likely fate.  \n\nOP, this sounds like a really difficult position. I don't think your siblings should have any say if they are not willing to help themselves. I almost understand your brother's reasoning but your sister I would have laughed too. \n\nIf your dad was at the point of stealing alcohol wipes to support his addiction, it was honestly likely he was never going to get clean. And this is coming from someone that struggles with alcohol myself and has had family that has too. Nobody ever got to that point, that's REALLY bad. \n\nHe seems like he would rather die early in his family's home rather than live longer in that facility. Given the conditions that you described, it's hard to blame him or you for these decisions", "It's a difficult situation. I don't think your or your siblings are the asshole. Likely your dad did many things that made him an asshole over his life and has resulted in your siblings disengaging. They have many more years of interaction with him and so more opportunity to have been hurt and want boundaries. \n\nI commend your siblings for holding their boundaries and I commend you for making a difficult choice to allow him to stay with you. \n\nPlease approach with an abundance of caution, and I highly recommend seeking out family support for children of alcoholics, Al-Anon \n\nHis situation is a result of his actions. Alcoholism is a serious disease and one of the worse to come away from.

I don\u2019t know anything about the legalities here but I would suggest talking to a lawyer. An angry sibling or aunt or uncle could suddenly materialize charging you with negligence or worse over your plan to provide him with the alcohol to drink himself to death.

I cut them off when I became an adult because I was tired of being called a whore by my grandma when I wouldn't drive to the store and buy her more Wild Turkey. I lived within 4 hours of them but didn't speak to them for over 10 years. My father called me one day and asked me to drive there a couple of days after Christmas because both had fallen and had been taken to different hospitals. I got there to find it was much worse than I originally thought, my grandmother fell first so my grandfather was there to call her an ambulance and she was taken to a hospital immediately. My grandfather fell and hit his head the next day and laid there for 3 days until his drinking buddies came to look for him. When I got to their city I immediately went to my grandfather and he was conscious and seemed okay, the nurses told me that his condition was much worse than it seemed because he laid there so long and his body was already ravaged from the alcohol for 60 plus years that they didn't think he was going to make it. He passed peacefully a couple of days later in the hospital. My grandmother at this time had been moved into a care facility because she was basically a child. This is a woman who is not only a lifelong alcoholic but also a diabetic. They told me that when she finally woke up at the hospital that she didn't know who she was or where she was and wasn't really talking. I was able to see her both before she woke up and after and she was basically just the shell of a person that I used to know. She fought hard and she was in and out of the hospital and care facilities for almost a year. I had her moved close to me so that I could at least visit her and make sure that she wasn't being mistreated. She luckily had very good health insurance because my grandfather was retired from the army. At some point she came back to herself and I had to break it to her that her husband was dead and had passed while she was in this haze. They were alcoholics and terrible to their family but the one thing they did have was love for each other, they were definitely soulmates so this crushed her. She began begging to get out of the care facility she was in, it was a very nice care facility not at all like the one that your father was in, that would have been horrifying to see how you've described it. I spoke with my parents and because they lived several states away the original plan was to move her into my house, and let me care for her until she inevitably passed because we also knew that once we took her out of the hospital there was no way she would stay sober. I ended up being diagnosed with cancer that year so my parents had to move her to their home several states away where she lived for several years until she insisted to live on her own and then drank herself to death within 6 months. I miss her, especially since we were able to kind of bond a little at the end, but it was a much nicer death than it could have been. She definitely could have been suffering at the end and she luckily was in her happy place.\n\nI said all of this to say that you are a thousand percent correct in that it's better for him to pass on his own terms in a place that respects him as a person and helps keep some of his dignity intact. I'm very happy that my grandmother was able to be around all of us at the end and we did kind of mend some fences after she realized what she had lost when her husband passed. None of this was enough to stop her from drinking again though, which none of us expected her to anyways. Her health, being a diabetic, was always in danger because of her drinking and that never stopped her. She had multiple heart attacks and once crashed into a telephone pole that took out the electricity for her entire neighborhood and that didn't stop her either. I kind of looked at it as we were making her comfortable and keeping her from hurting anybody else, because she was very destructive as a drunk.\n\nThis is such a tough situation to be in and I don't think it's fair for your siblings to judge unless they're willing to put themselves there too and help out.", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear everything that\u2019s happened to you.

But hey, he has you as big bro to tell him \"chill bro, nothing bad could ever happen to you\", so I guess he's going to be fine. Waiting to check your lawyer degrees.", "They are NOT possible consequences. You can give a 30 pack of beer to an alcoholic every day and house them at their request without ANY legal liability. \n\nThe father is a terminal alcoholic, there is nothing remotely illegal happening here.  If you don't believe me feel free to use Ask a Lawyer subreddit for confirmation. You won't though, because you are aware you're wrong (after your search for any case that might prove your erroneous theory).  It's hilarious that your ego won't allow you to admit you were wrong on Reddit... I can't imagine how well you function IRL if this is how adamant you are about resisting new information. \n\nIt's OK to be wrong and to learn, it's actually a fundamental necessity in order to reach full emotional maturity and have satisfying relationships in the real world.  I hope with all my being you're not yet 25, so your brain isn't done settling yet."]}
