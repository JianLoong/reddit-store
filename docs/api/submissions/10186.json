That\u2019s not how it works. Brother & SIL need to chill out & take care of their own kid. \n\nMy youngest son\u2019s first word was mama... so sweet! For the next 3 months he would point at everything & call it mama. Clearly, didn\u2019t get it. Kids are funny lil creatures. \n\nNTA", "NTA- my son was almost two the first time he spoke, and it was 2 words.  I was singing to him, like I did every time I put him to sleep, and he put his hand on my mouth and said \"No Mama \". He proceeded to do the same every time I tried to sing to him.  Talk about a bruised ego!! That being said,  I was just happy to finally hear him talk. I'm very concerned about what a mother screaming and crying when her baby tries to talk will do to that baby's development.  I hope I'm wrong,  but that sounds like she just taught the lesson that talking is the worst thing ever and may cause a set back.  I would strongly suggest someone find a way to get her some mental health help.", "NTA\n\nYou have the kid five days a week. Of course he'll bond with you and it's not surprising he said your name. You're the one raising him. I have no idea what's the matter with your SIL that she leaves him with you this much when she's at home, maybe she has PPD? But anyways, this whole outburst is the result of her insecurities because she knows she's not doing what she should be doing if she wants to be her son's main person. It's a her-problem, not a you-problem.", "NTA. One thing your SIL is absolutely wrong about is who the first word belongs to. It belongs to the child saying it. Yes, many parents do happen to be around when it\u2019s said but many aren\u2019t. It\u2019s just the way it is and most parents would cheer on the kid saying it, no matter what. Hell, my sister and BIL used to study architecture so they said their kid\u2019s first word would be \u201cinfrastructure\u201d. It wasn\u2019t. They knew it wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s just the matter of attitude. I don\u2019t even remember what their kids\u2019 first words were. I bet they don\u2019t remember, either. One thing\u2019s for sure, though, shouting at each other AND the kid after saying his first word? That\u2019s fucked up. There\u2019s a good chance they just made it the first real bad experience and he\u2019ll easily connect it with talking so good luck with getting anything out of him after this. Your SIL is the AH.", "NTA.  Anyone thinking that they control what random syllable or two is going to be the first out of a baby's mouth is not thinking clearly and likely to be disappointed.  At 15 months he probably has a lot of words in his head but hasn't been able to vocalize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYears ago, I spent a lot of time around a kid who could point to the right colors, letters, and animals at three years old, but could only say \"Guh guh.\"  That kid went from \"guh guh\" to full, short sentences.", "NTA. My son\u2019s first word was bird. I doubt the cardinal outside his window was coaching him.", "NTA people are too precious. Hell my first word was \u201cget\u201d that\u2019s what happens when you have older siblings. Lol", "Do they never baby talk to their kid?  That plays an important part in the earliest stages of language acquisition, because it\u2018s simpler sounds that the baby starts trying out.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you could possibly be TA, you didn\u2019t do anything. Babies start talking to communicate what they want, and you spend quality time with him, so he wanted you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI will start by saying that this circumstance is VERY odd. It sounds like we're maybe missing pieces of the situation. But, given what we are, there's no possible way as it's told, that you could be the ahole; even if you WERE coaching the kid to say your name haha. \n\nHe spends all his time with you. And you can never predict what a baby's first word(s) will be. They should just be happy that the kid didn't call YOU \"father\" bwhahahhahaha. All things aside, what a weird thing for them to get upset at you for and storm out over. If they were so concerned, they should have done more parenting themselves. And learned how babies work haha...Because \"mother\" and \"father\" is not it. hahhahahhaha", "NTA They're being ridiculous", "NTA\n\nDon't apologise, don't get riled up. Anyone who causes aggro about this tell them \n\n1) your the babies primary caregiver. of course he's going to say your name first.  If they have an issue they need to actually play and look after the baby. \n\n2) after the negative feedback he received after his first words good luck to them because baby might go back to clamping up.", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like you\u2019re more of a parent to your nephew than his own!! She\u2019s a SAHM and you have her child 5 days a week??? No wonder he said your name first!! She sounds like she made at herself for not being preset in her son\u2019s life, but rather than being angry at herself and being accountable for not being a parent, it\u2019s easier for her to put the blame on you! As much as I\u2019m sure you love your nephew, stop babysitting so much for them. If she were working I could understand! But WTF is she doing 5 days a week while you\u2019re basically raising HER kid??!", "NTA. OP literally has zero control over what and when those words come out.  Maybe if the parents aren't more time, well, parenting the outcome would have been different.  Sorry your family sucks OP, but you need to take a step back from being used for free childcare", "NTA. My kid\u2019s first word was the name of the cat. That said, 15 months seems late to have words, and this seems like an awful situation. How old are you all? Why is your nephew your responsibility? Why aren\u2019t your parents involved?", "NTA - You can't control the babies first words. It is a bit unfortunate, but at the end of the day, there's really way no way to control what the first word is. Sometimes, it's the most random thing. The parents need to let it go and just celebrate this milestone.", "NTA\n\nMy second kid's first word was duck. Am I to wage a grudge on waterfowl? They're being weird.", "NTA - parents owe you a huge apology", "NTA.\n\nThis only shows how little time they are spending with their own child. A child picks up the names and language of the people who are around them the most. In this case it happens to be you. If your brother and SIL wanted their child's first words to be about them, they should've spent more time with him.", "NTA. In all honesty I'd apologise to the mother saying \"I'm so sorry that I have YOUR son with me 5 days a week whilst you pamper yourself. Maybe if you spent more time with him he would say mama.\" I'd also stop having him so much. If they still want you to babysit tell them it's twice a week and no more at family functions. You're his uncle not his mother or his father.", "NTA \n\n15 months seem late for a first word though.\n\nGiven his moms reaction at shouting at the baby, I\u2019d guess there was some postpartum issues which is why you\u2019ve been asked to look after him so much even though she\u2019s home.", "Nta\n\nBrother and SIL sound like less than good parents", "NTA. Maybe, instead of getting angry at you, they should take this as an opportunity to take a look at their own lives and how much time they are *not* spending with their own child and, perhaps, how much affection they actually show their child.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Do not apologize. Do make yourself unavailable to them for all childcare going forward.", "They made their bed, now they have to lie in it. You did nothing wrong, quite the opposite, actually. They've been using you & are now unhappy that it's backfiring on them. They sound ungrateful, on top of it all. **NTA.**", "NTA your brother and SIL are incredibly selfish. The child doesnt exist to feed their ego. And the mother father thing is also wierd AF. You sound fun! I would be so happy if my kids' first word was their uncle's name. It would be such a special story and connection.", "This is the dumbest conflict ever. \u2018BEN\u2019 is a lot easier than \u2018mother/father\u2019. \n\nLet alone, if you\u2019re the primary caregiver and people are calling your name, it\u2019s something he hears repeatedly.\n\nNTA\n\nBut now I want rice.", "NTA. \n\nBrother and SIL are absolutely disgusting shitstained assholes though. Shouting at their kid over this is gross and everyone who thinks otherwise needs to fuck off.", "NTA obviously.\n\nYou literally can't control a baby's first words. They should in turn be happy about it and make it a family joke lol. But yeah you are NTA.", "NTA \n\nDo you want to look after him 5 days a week? I world say no more unless they apologise and then only if they accept that the next few words may be dairy related.\n\nThen the petty in me would teach him mmmmilk, mooooo and at a push fffffarmer \ud83e\udd23", "NTA kids say whatever, my sister first word was: nothing! She was 9 months old and my mom asked her: Virginia what are you doing? And I guess she decided it was time to talk and answer truthfully", "What\u2019s wrong with your family \ud83d\ude33 you and the baby seems to be the only normal people here. You took away the first word?! Shouting at the little baby, cause it talks?!?? And your parents think, you are the asshole here?! Show them the all the comments here. I feel sorry for you and the baby. They really should just spend more nice time with their kid, if they want to be real parents.", "Nta. \n\nIt was bound to happen. \nAlso, please call child safety. There is something seriously wrong with your brother and SIL.", "NTA and holy hell. These two are horribly unfit parents and you are an amazing uncle. You need to 1) get CPS involved (or your equivalent) because this is clearly abuse and 2) try an stay involved in this kids life because he will need you and too keep and eye out for physical abuse. Them just leaving the kid at your place and then just forking off is probably enough by itself to have them declared unfit parents.", "You are definitely NTA. The parents however so are. For one thing, what 1 year old uses the term mother and father?!?! My daughter is 3 and still doesn\u2019t use those terms. It\u2019s mama and dada, or lately mommy and daddy. To expect him to use that formal of a title is ridiculous. Then putting so much pressure on the poor kid. It\u2019s going to backfire on them and then he\u2019s not going to speak at all.", "NTA and your brother and SIL are abusive. Calling the baby an idiot! Shoving him when he tries to walk! Stealing him down when he crawls! Not playing/talking to him! They are awful parents. Call cps on them. You are a great uncle and sounds like the only on me in the family that actually cares about the kids. Your parents want you to apologize! Wow, enabling much? Keep watching him (even though you shouldn\u2019t have to). Look out for bruises. Call cps every time you witness anything remotely abusive. Maybe if you are financially secure enough, and really want to see if you can adopt the baby. He is not in a good environment with his \u201cmother and father\u201d. The abuse will get worse.

Tell them they should watch their own son if you're such an AH. I bet they'll still offload him on you and still treat you like dirt. \n\nTry not to walk too much infront of nephew. God knows what your brother and SIL are gonna do if your nephew takes his first steps in front of you.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nSaw your other comments about your nephew walking. Your SIL is batshit insane. Part of me wishes this post is fake knowing AITA.", "Dude, you need to have a serious talk with your brother. Not your SIL or anybody else, your brother alone. This is well within abusive behaviour which, thanks to your SIL not looking after their own child, you get to witness. But you shouldn\u2019t assist. And by doing what she demands, you would. I hope you manage to get this child out if this situation, one way or another! \u2764\ufe0f", "That's straight-up abusive.", "That is straight up emotional abuse she is telling you to do. I am really concerned about the poor kid.", "Then they are fools and need to learn about early childhood development. \u201cJust making sounds\u201d is an important step in language acquisition!  Experimenting with random sounds is how most babies start, and then they start trying to shape sounds to get the attention they want.", "And now it\u2019s 15 months and it\u2019s like you\u2019re the primary caregiver. Why isn\u2019t your brother stepping up? I just feel so bad for you", "That's insane. If she's in therapy, she's lying to her therapist because that is not normal behavior.", "I believe that SIL needs help. She is teaching the baby to not take initiative or try new things and that everything he does is terrible and should be punished. No wonder it takes him longer to feel safe to try. Maybe try talking to your brother? \n\nThat baby is lucky to have you in his life. Definitely NTA.", "Uncle\u2026Ben.", "Go for moooooo!!!! Interesting how mad they were, but not mad enough to look after their kid!!\n\nGo for all the baby talk you can though,  seriously, he needs it!!", "I'd kill for a day off. I don't even have time off when my kids(twins 16f) go to their dad's house because they are always texting or calling me for something. If I'm lucky enough to not hear from them for a few hours, my oldest daughter is calling to chat or my granddaughter wants to talk. I don't think I've had a day off from parenting in 29 years.", "my brother is fully on board with her i tried talking to them alone but he tells me im not a father and so m opnion is worth less and that My SIL as a mother knows what best", "brother works 4 days a week mon tue thursday friday i have nephew all week except weekends ive aksed them multiple times to stop and i want to expand farming but cant and they just ignore me sometimes ill come up from the morning milking and hell be just left on my sofa at 7:30 in the morning and they wont take him back till like 8:30", "talking to my brother is pointless he agrees with everything she says even when shes not around he would also shove him down when he tried walking when he tried crawling my brother picked him up and would strap him tightly into the car seat that just sits on the their living room floor", "Oh, that\u2019s very sad.. :( One thing you can do is keep having him over, purely to keep an eye on him if he ever has bruises (more or different ones than a child typically his age would have). Because a parent that uses verbal abuse this early on will also likely end up physically hurting him. I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019d say stop doing this favour for them and let them parent him, but at this stage the kid\u2019s better off spending time with you. And don\u2019t stop talking to him. F\u2019 that horrible woman, if she doesn\u2019t care enough to be his mom (sorry\u2026 MOTHER), then that\u2019s on her.", "Your nephew is with you five days a week. If they want you to keep parenting him your input matters just as much. If your parents refuse to look after their grandson so should you. Can't you lock your property or does your brother and SIL have a spare key?", "Dude you need to stop that. I know you love your nephew but they\u2019re totally taking advantage of you.", "You\u2019re a young guy with his own dreams. You shouldn\u2019t be saddled with someone else\u2019s baby, especially if your SIL does nothing all day.", "That is really sad... It's wonderful that you have the time and you want to help right now and I'm sure your contribution is helping him a lot, but that might not be the case forever. What if you have your own family, or something happens and you don't have the time or the ability to help. My heart breaks for the little guy.\n\nMaybe if you talked to your parents or some other family/friends that could talk to them and possibly advise them to see a psychologist as a family? Or a professional on childcare that could gently show them what they are doing wrong?\n\nIn any case, don't feel bad for this, even for a second. This baby is lucky to have you. I had horrible parents and no one else to turn to, this little guy has a wonderful uncle that cares deeply for him. I'm sure he will cherish your relationship for years to come.", "My god, they are absolutely terrible and abusive parents.  Does no one else in your family see this?   Something needs to change at home for that kid or he is going to have real problems.", "Please report this to CPS", "what can i do ive tried bringing him back to their house but they ignore me and will dissapear to town if they see my pickup coming over the hills and i dont want to neglect him i seem to be the only positive influence in his life", "You can report this to CPS (or equivalent where you live)", "Wait. They\u2019re just coming into your house and leaving him in your sofa?!  WHOA. That\u2019s seriously screwed up."]}
