My brother and his wife have been trying to get him to say his first words although its not simple and they don't exactly make it easier, instead of mamma or dadda they coax him to say Mother and father and my nephew just dosent get it he's a baby and those words seem kinda complicated for a baby.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe where all over at my parents house for a Sunday get together and i was sitting playing blocks with my nephew, He suddenly looks up at me and starts going B B B B B BE BE i thought it was just normal baby talk then he gets more aggressive repeating those letters over and over again then He starts going N N N N N, he then shouts BEN and points at me and laughs BEN BEN BEN (my name) my brother and SIL start yelling at me saying i was coaching him and how i was being selfish, they immediately pick him up and My brother yells at me \"you took away his first word that was supposed to be our moment\" they storm off to another room they stay in there for about 10 mins and then come out and leave but as they are leaving the baby looks at me again and shouts in the playful baby voice BEN and points at me again my sil shouts at her son so her son starts crying then she shouts at him more starts crying herself and they leave\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents think I'm an ass and i shouldn't have been teaching him my name, but i havent the only time he hears my name is when anyone else says it. they think i should apologise to My SIL for ruining why should have been a mothers special moment.

That\u2019s not how it works. Brother & SIL need to chill out & take care of their own kid. \n\nMy youngest son\u2019s first word was mama... so sweet! For the next 3 months he would point at everything & call it mama. Clearly, didn\u2019t get it. Kids are funny lil creatures. \n\nNTA", "NTA- my son was almost two the first time he spoke, and it was 2 words.  I was singing to him, like I did every time I put him to sleep, and he put his hand on my mouth and said \"No Mama \". He proceeded to do the same every time I tried to sing to him.  Talk about a bruised ego!! That being said,  I was just happy to finally hear him talk. I'm very concerned about what a mother screaming and crying when her baby tries to talk will do to that baby's development.  I hope I'm wrong,  but that sounds like she just taught the lesson that talking is the worst thing ever and may cause a set back.  I would strongly suggest someone find a way to get her some mental health help.", "NTA\n\nYou have the kid five days a week. Of course he'll bond with you and it's not surprising he said your name. You're the one raising him. I have no idea what's the matter with your SIL that she leaves him with you this much when she's at home, maybe she has PPD? But anyways, this whole outburst is the result of her insecurities because she knows she's not doing what she should be doing if she wants to be her son's main person. It's a her-problem, not a you-problem.", "NTA. One thing your SIL is absolutely wrong about is who the first word belongs to. It belongs to the child saying it. Yes, many parents do happen to be around when it\u2019s said but many aren\u2019t. It\u2019s just the way it is and most parents would cheer on the kid saying it, no matter what. Hell, my sister and BIL used to study architecture so they said their kid\u2019s first word would be \u201cinfrastructure\u201d. It wasn\u2019t. They knew it wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s just the matter of attitude. I don\u2019t even remember what their kids\u2019 first words were. I bet they don\u2019t remember, either. One thing\u2019s for sure, though, shouting at each other AND the kid after saying his first word? That\u2019s fucked up. There\u2019s a good chance they just made it the first real bad experience and he\u2019ll easily connect it with talking so good luck with getting anything out of him after this. Your SIL is the AH.", "NTA.  Anyone thinking that they control what random syllable or two is going to be the first out of a baby's mouth is not thinking clearly and likely to be disappointed.  At 15 months he probably has a lot of words in his head but hasn't been able to vocalize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYears ago, I spent a lot of time around a kid who could point to the right colors, letters, and animals at three years old, but could only say \"Guh guh.\"  That kid went from \"guh guh\" to full, short sentences.", "NTA. My son\u2019s first word was bird. I doubt the cardinal outside his window was coaching him.", "NTA people are too precious. Hell my first word was \u201cget\u201d that\u2019s what happens when you have older siblings. Lol", "Do they never baby talk to their kid?  That plays an important part in the earliest stages of language acquisition, because it\u2018s simpler sounds that the baby starts trying out.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you could possibly be TA, you didn\u2019t do anything. Babies start talking to communicate what they want, and you spend quality time with him, so he wanted you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI will start by saying that this circumstance is VERY odd. It sounds like we're maybe missing pieces of the situation. But, given what we are, there's no possible way as it's told, that you could be the ahole; even if you WERE coaching the kid to say your name haha. \n\nHe spends all his time with you. And you can never predict what a baby's first word(s) will be. They should just be happy that the kid didn't call YOU \"father\" bwhahahhahaha. All things aside, what a weird thing for them to get upset at you for and storm out over. If they were so concerned, they should have done more parenting themselves. And learned how babies work haha...Because \"mother\" and \"father\" is not it. hahhahahhaha", "NTA They're being ridiculous", "NTA\n\nDon't apologise, don't get riled up. Anyone who causes aggro about this tell them \n\n1) your the babies primary caregiver. of course he's going to say your name first.  If they have an issue they need to actually play and look after the baby. \n\n2) after the negative feedback he received after his first words good luck to them because baby might go back to clamping up.", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like you\u2019re more of a parent to your nephew than his own!! She\u2019s a SAHM and you have her child 5 days a week??? No wonder he said your name first!! She sounds like she made at herself for not being preset in her son\u2019s life, but rather than being angry at herself and being accountable for not being a parent, it\u2019s easier for her to put the blame on you! As much as I\u2019m sure you love your nephew, stop babysitting so much for them. If she were working I could understand! But WTF is she doing 5 days a week while you\u2019re basically raising HER kid??!", "NTA. OP literally has zero control over what and when those words come out.  Maybe if the parents aren't more time, well, parenting the outcome would have been different.  Sorry your family sucks OP, but you need to take a step back from being used for free childcare", "NTA. My kid\u2019s first word was the name of the cat. That said, 15 months seems late to have words, and this seems like an awful situation. How old are you all? Why is your nephew your responsibility? Why aren\u2019t your parents involved?", "NTA - You can't control the babies first words. It is a bit unfortunate, but at the end of the day, there's really way no way to control what the first word is. Sometimes, it's the most random thing. The parents need to let it go and just celebrate this milestone.", "NTA\n\nMy second kid's first word was duck. Am I to wage a grudge on waterfowl? They're being weird.", "NTA - parents owe you a huge apology", "NTA.\n\nThis only shows how little time they are spending with their own child. A child picks up the names and language of the people who are around them the most. In this case it happens to be you. If your brother and SIL wanted their child's first words to be about them, they should've spent more time with him.", "NTA. In all honesty I'd apologise to the mother saying \"I'm so sorry that I have YOUR son with me 5 days a week whilst you pamper yourself. Maybe if you spent more time with him he would say mama.\" I'd also stop having him so much. If they still want you to babysit tell them it's twice a week and no more at family functions. You're his uncle not his mother or his father.", "NTA \n\n15 months seem late for a first word though.\n\nGiven his moms reaction at shouting at the baby, I\u2019d guess there was some postpartum issues which is why you\u2019ve been asked to look after him so much even though she\u2019s home.", "Nta\n\nBrother and SIL sound like less than good parents", "NTA. Maybe, instead of getting angry at you, they should take this as an opportunity to take a look at their own lives and how much time they are *not* spending with their own child and, perhaps, how much affection they actually show their child.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Do not apologize. Do make yourself unavailable to them for all childcare going forward.", "They made their bed, now they have to lie in it. You did nothing wrong, quite the opposite, actually. They've been using you & are now unhappy that it's backfiring on them. They sound ungrateful, on top of it all. **NTA.**", "NTA your brother and SIL are incredibly selfish. The child doesnt exist to feed their ego. And the mother father thing is also wierd AF. You sound fun! I would be so happy if my kids' first word was their uncle's name. It would be such a special story and connection.", "This is the dumbest conflict ever. \u2018BEN\u2019 is a lot easier than \u2018mother/father\u2019. \n\nLet alone, if you\u2019re the primary caregiver and people are calling your name, it\u2019s something he hears repeatedly.\n\nNTA\n\nBut now I want rice.", "NTA. \n\nBrother and SIL are absolutely disgusting shitstained assholes though. Shouting at their kid over this is gross and everyone who thinks otherwise needs to fuck off.", "NTA obviously.\n\nYou literally can't control a baby's first words. They should in turn be happy about it and make it a family joke lol. But yeah you are NTA.", "NTA \n\nDo you want to look after him 5 days a week? I world say no more unless they apologise and then only if they accept that the next few words may be dairy related.\n\nThen the petty in me would teach him mmmmilk, mooooo and at a push fffffarmer \ud83e\udd23", "NTA kids say whatever, my sister first word was: nothing! She was 9 months old and my mom asked her: Virginia what are you doing? And I guess she decided it was time to talk and answer truthfully", "What\u2019s wrong with your family \ud83d\ude33 you and the baby seems to be the only normal people here. You took away the first word?! Shouting at the little baby, cause it talks?!?? And your parents think, you are the asshole here?! Show them the all the comments here. I feel sorry for you and the baby. They really should just spend more nice time with their kid, if they want to be real parents.", "Nta. \n\nIt was bound to happen. \nAlso, please call child safety. There is something seriously wrong with your brother and SIL.", "NTA and holy hell. These two are horribly unfit parents and you are an amazing uncle. You need to 1) get CPS involved (or your equivalent) because this is clearly abuse and 2) try an stay involved in this kids life because he will need you and too keep and eye out for physical abuse. Them just leaving the kid at your place and then just forking off is probably enough by itself to have them declared unfit parents.", "You are definitely NTA. The parents however so are. For one thing, what 1 year old uses the term mother and father?!?! My daughter is 3 and still doesn\u2019t use those terms. It\u2019s mama and dada, or lately mommy and daddy. To expect him to use that formal of a title is ridiculous. Then putting so much pressure on the poor kid. It\u2019s going to backfire on them and then he\u2019s not going to speak at all.", "NTA and your brother and SIL are abusive. Calling the baby an idiot! Shoving him when he tries to walk! Stealing him down when he crawls! Not playing/talking to him! They are awful parents. Call cps on them. You are a great uncle and sounds like the only on me in the family that actually cares about the kids. Your parents want you to apologize! Wow, enabling much? Keep watching him (even though you shouldn\u2019t have to). Look out for bruises. Call cps every time you witness anything remotely abusive. Maybe if you are financially secure enough, and really want to see if you can adopt the baby. He is not in a good environment with his \u201cmother and father\u201d. The abuse will get worse.

First word, first steps - kids are so novel! Then they grow up and the newness wears off. They are no longer cute, helpless babies, but they become people with opinions who sometimes make bad decisions, and sometimes parents will stop being as kind, and before you know it, they're grown adults who sometimes aren't the greatest people. Parents and others who care for the children of the world, be grateful they are in your life, and try to be a good example  and not grouse about stupid arbitrary b.s. like their first word, steps, full diaper, spit up, crying all night for months without any reason you ever find out because there was none.

I do have nephews, nieces, and students though, and they all have expressed at times how much they wish their parents understood and respected them like I do. The parents ask again and again how do I get them to do things? How do I get through to them? What is my magic formula for communicating with them? Ykw it is? I listen to them and treat them like people. This is a completely alien concept to them, apparently.

At least you\u2019d have a chance of getting her bullshit on record for CPS.", ">Yelling at a baby because you\u2019re tired and you\u2019re losing your mind is pretty bad\n\nAgreed but at least it's understandable. Everyone does things  when they're overwhelmed, exhausted, or stressed that they regret as soon as they can think straight again. That doesn't make it less traumatic for the kid in the moment but easier to work through when they get older. What the SIL is doing is straight up psychotic.", "NTA. They told their baby he was an idiot!?!", "Holy shit, these people should NOT be allowed to have custody of a child!! They're punishing him for being a real baby doing real baby things instead of being their perfect toy! They've probably already caused plenty of trauma in his developing brain, and it's only going to get worse with time.", "He is a child, oooh they are going to give that kid a complex amd stress him out", "LOL, ok there are studies in developmental psychology about the reason we use 'baby speak' with babies and it actually having a function to promote faster language acquisition. And if they want him to develop faster they need to be paying crazy personal attention to the little guy, sounds like they're absent an awful lot for wanting him to be a wunderkind.", "Apparently my first words were a full sentence: \"I love you, dada.\" My mother was *pissed*. \ud83e\udd23", "My mom\u2019s first sentence was \u201cgive me meat!\u201d And she\u2019d still rather have steak than cookies!", "THIS. THIS is your opening. It gives you grounds for calling police/CPS for child abandonment (not to mention child endangerment being left completely alone without anyone aware he\u2019s there) and then you tack on everything else you\u2019ve observed. That\u2019s what you can do. It\u2019s what you need to do. You\u2019ve gone above and beyond already for that little boy when it\u2019s never been your responsibility or obligation and it is so admirable. I know it\u2019s unfair to you but you truly give him a safe place to just be a baby. You are a bright light for him and one day he will know it and truly comprehend. That\u2019s worth something. It seems unfair to ask anything else of you but truly, it\u2019s the best thing you can do for him. The next time they drop him and run off, call the cops. Record their interactions when you can. At least start a paper trail bc they will not get better. It would be nice if you could take him in bc you are someone he loves and trusts, probably the only one .. but again.. that\u2019s a lot to ask for and you never signed up for it. Maybe something to keep in mind though if it\u2019s something that\u2019s doable. \n\nYou\u2019re a damn good uncle and a good person. I\u2019m so glad your nephew has you.", "Report them to customers for child abandonment", "Useful is certainly one word to describe the collection.", "They don't want a child; they want a trophy. NTA", "Yea developmental issues they caused\u2026 on purpose. It\u2019s incomprehensible"]}
