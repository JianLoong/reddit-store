I'm a long time lurker.\n\nI'm a 36 female and was a bridesmaid to my good friend's wedding, Anna 46. I was initially very honoured, until I went to the first bridesmaid's meeting at her house on Thursday.\n\nI realised Anna, hadn't chosen 8 of us, to be her bridesmaids because of our friendships with her, but because of our skills. Example one of her bridesmaids is a Hairdresser, so she will be doing all the hairstyles of the bridesmaids, Anna, Anna's sisters (whom are not bridesmaids) and her mother.\n\nI come from a big family so am used to cooking for large amounts of people, so I was expected to cook for 80 guests. I also make sculptures and jewellery out of wire silver clay, so was expected to make Anna's crown and necklaces, bracelets for Anna, the bridesmaids, sisters and mother. I was also expected make 20 wire sculptures for each table. (She wasn't offering any money for the ingredients and materials).\n\nAnna then said, that each bridesmaid needs to make an \u00a3800 donation. One of the bridesmaids (a Make up Artist) said she is not going to pay, to work for free and Anna said that a bridesmaid is meant to support the bride. Other bridesmaids spoke up, so Anna started shouting and at one point her husband to be, Mark stepped in. Two of the bridesmaids stormed off in the garden to smoke, but because one of them moved so fast their toddler seemed a little confused, so he ran in circles and then put his hand on my knee. I then scooped him up in my arms and placed him on my lap. Anna then shouted \"why are you moving when I'm talking, you stupid r... whore.\" I was very upset as she was dragging up my past and I don't know the other bridesmaids, they all went to University with Anna, I didn't. I wanted to leave but I had the little boy on my lap. Everyone was staring at me, whilst Anna kept talking and I desperately tried to hold back tears.\n\nI haven't told my loved ones about this because I'm just so upset and don't want to upset them, but Anna sent an email today with her bank details for the \u00a3800 and an attachment of the contract, detailing my duties. I emailed back saying that I can't fulfill my duties as a bridesmaid, so will be stepping down.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676209189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110fyj4/aita_for_stepping_down_as_bridesmaid/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it were me I would drop her so fast I would leave skid marks.", "As insane as this situation sounds I believe it\u2019s 100% true. Because I\u2019ve witnessed first hand the sudden rush of what looks like outright demonic possession when a seemingly \u201cnormal\u201d woman is planning her big day. Fortunately most people I\u2019ve come across remain normal throughout the whole process, but there are some that need to be put in a padded room to think about their choices.\n\nMy dad is a pastor. I play piano and sing, so a lot of couples who had my dad officiate would ask if I\u2019d play, sing, or both. 90% of the time I enjoyed every part of it. \n\nThe other 10% included a woman who, during the rehearsal, burst into ragey tears and dramatically collapsed to the floor while doing her practice walk to the front because \u201cother women just can\u2019t stop lusting after the man who was ordained by God to be her husband\u201d followed by \u201ceven the pastor\u2019s daughter can\u2019t contain her lust!!!\u201d The entire room fell silent looking at me and wondering what had just happened. She explained, still in her tearful rage, that while she walked down the aisle to a \u201clove song\u201d I was staring at her fianc\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s SO obvious she wants him!!\u201d Yeah no. As I was playing, my dad gave me the subtle signal we had between us to slow the tempo of the song. I was playing too fast. He was standing next to the groom for obvious reasons, but I wasn\u2019t looking at the groom, I was watching the tempo my dad was setting by tapping his leg. Apparently my \u201clust\u201d was so obvious for her man she \u201cfinally had to say something\u201d.\n\nThe funny part of the whole debacle was when she declared that \u201cwe all need to cover my relationship in prayer because Satan is at work here\u201d the grooms\u2019s best man said perfectly loud enough for all to hear, \u201cyes, Satan is clearly at work today but not in the way she\u2019s implying\u201d. My dad had to turn his head to hide his quiet laugh. She stormed out but not before demanding that I be removed from the wedding AND to \u201cinstruct her that she needs to worship elsewhere from now on\u201d (they both attended our church, groom had been there with his family since he was a kid, she\u2019d only been coming with him for 8 months)\n\nI calmly told the whole room that I\u2019m happy to have nothing to do with her wedding. They were all apologizing, groom\u2019s parents were mortified. Her parents ran out with her but they were clearly humiliated by their daughter\u2019s behavior. But they all knew at this point that I would not do it. My dad called the groom aside for a private conversation. The next morning my dad told me the wedding was still on but he wasn\u2019t officiating, it had to be rescheduled and done elsewhere if the groom wanted to proceed. In the meantime, the bride was badmouthing me all over the church, calling people, taking to social media with epic long posts to preach about lust and integrity, calling me out along with other women in the church by NAME (some single, but some *married*). Two days later we found out the groom called the whole thing off. He was so angry with her. He met with me and my parents and explained that ever since he proposed, a terrible side of her came out and it\u2019s been getting worse. He didn\u2019t want to marry her. And he apologized to me again for her behavior. I assured him he didn\u2019t need to do that on her behalf. What happened was necessary for him to finally have enough and make the wise choice to call it off.\n\nHe\u2019s now married to a really wonderful woman with a beautiful young family. They\u2019re happy and thriving and still in our church. Original bride wasn\u2019t heard from or seen again. But her parents sent me a nice note with a generous Starbucks gift card apologizing profusely as they were just as stunned by her recent behavior. (apparently more stuff was going on behind the scenes, which is not surprising)\n\nThe whole rehearsal, including the tantrum, storming out and the conversations we had after were all caught on camera, too. They\u2019d hired one of our church members to be the videographer and he just left it running. I saw it later that week. I would give anything for a copy of that right now. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. At all. How fucking dare she?", "Uh, no NTA, by a long shot.  And that isn't a friend, that's a user.  Drop out as bridesmaid and drop her as a friend.  What an awful person she sounds like.  \n\n\nAlso, you aren't burdening anyone with your duties, if she chooses to pass this one to someone else, and they agree, that is their decision, they are adults, just like you made the decision to not be a bridesmaid.  It sounds like Anna is basically just trying to use all of you to fund her wedding.  Bridesmaids don't fund the wedding, and I'm sure if you and the others drop out eventually all the bridesmaids will leave since her demands are ridiculous and then Anna and her husband to be will have to do what so many other people do, which is pay for her own wedding.", "NTA. \n\nI have to wonder how you could even think in a\nmillion years how you could be an asshole here.", "Tell her to \"get to fxxk\". She's a nasty piece of work and how dare she make such demands and speak to you in that way. University education or not, nobody speaks to anybody, especially a \"friend\" in this way. You sound like an amazing woman with many creative and nurturing skills as well as deep empathy. You are so so superior to her. You should have absolutely no regrets for dumping this bxxch.", "This wasn\u2019t a bridezilla, this was Mecha-Bridezilla, destroyer of worlds.", "NTA. And by the way . . . Contract!?", "This.  NTA, OP, and I am so sorry you had to deal with that.", "She is a user. This is true for all the (hopefully former) bridesmaids", "I\u2019d keep the \u00a3800, contact the other \u2018bridesmaids\u2019 and plan a holiday with them scheduled for the weekend of the wedding, being sure to post all the best photos.", "She...doesn't.  OP clearly stated the 8 people she asked to be bridesmaids were NOT friends but rather people she thought would pay and slave away to be in the wedding.", "Right, bride wasn't drunk when she picked her 8 skilled bridesmaids, she wasn't drunk when she sent her banking info, and she wasn't drunk when she decided on the dollar amount and labor she was entitled to.... OP is NTA, except for maybe being unkind to herself for even considering being TAH in this scenario.", "Yes, Anna the Hun certainly gifted her indentured bridesmaids with the knowledge of how little she valued the as friends/people  more as slaves and ATM machines. Helpful knowledge before anyone invests anytime.  \n\nSounds like she and her fiance are a match made in hell.", "This isn\u2019t even a bride. This is Godzilla herself.", "Exactly the image I had when I read that comment.", "She doesn't really want bridesmaids. She wants a work crew and a cash cow.", "Hey now let\u2019s not insult Godzilla\ud83d\ude02."]}
