I'm a long time lurker.\n\nI'm a 36 female and was a bridesmaid to my good friend's wedding, Anna 46. I was initially very honoured, until I went to the first bridesmaid's meeting at her house on Thursday.\n\nI realised Anna, hadn't chosen 8 of us, to be her bridesmaids because of our friendships with her, but because of our skills. Example one of her bridesmaids is a Hairdresser, so she will be doing all the hairstyles of the bridesmaids, Anna, Anna's sisters (whom are not bridesmaids) and her mother.\n\nI come from a big family so am used to cooking for large amounts of people, so I was expected to cook for 80 guests. I also make sculptures and jewellery out of wire silver clay, so was expected to make Anna's crown and necklaces, bracelets for Anna, the bridesmaids, sisters and mother. I was also expected make 20 wire sculptures for each table. (She wasn't offering any money for the ingredients and materials).\n\nAnna then said, that each bridesmaid needs to make an \u00a3800 donation. One of the bridesmaids (a Make up Artist) said she is not going to pay, to work for free and Anna said that a bridesmaid is meant to support the bride. Other bridesmaids spoke up, so Anna started shouting and at one point her husband to be, Mark stepped in. Two of the bridesmaids stormed off in the garden to smoke, but because one of them moved so fast their toddler seemed a little confused, so he ran in circles and then put his hand on my knee. I then scooped him up in my arms and placed him on my lap. Anna then shouted \"why are you moving when I'm talking, you stupid r... whore.\" I was very upset as she was dragging up my past and I don't know the other bridesmaids, they all went to University with Anna, I didn't. I wanted to leave but I had the little boy on my lap. Everyone was staring at me, whilst Anna kept talking and I desperately tried to hold back tears.\n\nI haven't told my loved ones about this because I'm just so upset and don't want to upset them, but Anna sent an email today with her bank details for the \u00a3800 and an attachment of the contract, detailing my duties. I emailed back saying that I can't fulfill my duties as a bridesmaid, so will be stepping down.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676209189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110fyj4/aita_for_stepping_down_as_bridesmaid/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't even go to the wedding. Some people, for some crazy reason, feel like it is an honor to attend their wedding and that they are owed some kind of tribute.
