This is something huge for you to deal with, and it's totally understandable that you are upset that you didn't know before (and perhaps even more upset that it was your aunt and not your parents who told you).  But. \n\nThink back, if you can, to when you were 12, 13, 14.  Would you really have wanted to know that you weren't expected to live to 25?  Can you imagine how that would have felt?\n\nYour parents wanted you to have a happy life without the burden and expectation that you would die soon.  They wanted you, in short, to be a normal teenager.  And they took on the entire burden of worrying that their beloved child would die far too young, without telling you or apparently even letting it slip at all that you had this horrible prognosis.  I'd call that wonderful parenting, and I applaud them. \n\nNAH", "NAH, they were parents trying to protect a 12 year old.\n\nYou have every right to be angry, but they were trying to make your live happy and not have you live expecting to die. It would be a different ruling if the doctor gave you month to live, but at 10years a lot can happen to extend that indefinitely.", "NAH there's no good way to tell a 12 year old that. That information could have sent you spiraling mentally which would have impacted you physically and could have made you get worse.  \n  \nIf things were looking bad after a while they could have let you in on it to help you prepare but thankfully that didn't have to happen.  \n    \nYou're well within your rights to be upset they withheld that information from you. Can you think of a way to tell a 12 year old they are going to die soon that wouldn't negatively impact their life? Sometimes in life you have to kick hard decisions down the line and hope by the time you revisit them the situation has changed enough to avoid it.  \n  \nAlso you were 12. You weren't exactly going to be out there living the wild life experiencing everything the world has to offer while you still could. You would have been in the exact same place but now angry and scared", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for being mad. They\u2019re not assholes for deciding not to tell their 12 year old that they had 10 years to live. They made that decision because they thought it was in your best interest. You can be mad about it all you want, but it doesn\u2019t change what happened or make them assholes. \n\nSeems like it worked out for the best, considering. You didn\u2019t live in fear of death and you didn\u2019t decline either.

Parents can\u2019t win, especially in situations like this one. \n\nCan\u2019t you guys just be happy you didn\u2019t die?\n\nNo one is the asshole, just move past it.", "NTA but one question would your life been better if you knew.", "NAH I can understand it hurts you now but what they did wasn't to hurt you but to let you have the best 10yrs without fear , Imagine if they did tell you at that age &  how those 10 yrs would have been for you .", "NAH, you have every right to be angry at them. But try to see it from their point of view, they were trying to protect you and give you a good life. So that you can live and not always think about the fact that you might die soon.", "NAH \n\nI understand why your angry as its information that as an adult and adult would have known.\n\nHowever. I fully understand why your parents never told you as a child that you had 10 years to live. \n\nAlso bare in mind the medical professionals didn't disclose this either to you.\n\nTo them, if you truly have 10 years to live, then they didn't want those 10 years with a poor prognosis in everyones minds.\n\nNot telling you probably gave you a chance at somewhat a normal teenage life without that prognosis lingering.", "Nah - I understand you're shocked. But who knows what would be our own reaction facing such a terrible situation? Hopefully we'll never know.\n\nThe only a-holish move here is your parents dismissing your feelings. They could acknowledge them, but it doesn't mean they have to agree with you. Maybe telling you at 12 would have created damages. Look at the bigger picture. Are they usually respectful and trustworthy parents? If so, then put yourself in their shoes as well. If not, the issue goes beyond not telling you 10 years ago.\n\nHappy to know you're healthy today.", "I think a little momentary angst for what is obviously a very heavy situation is understandable, but ultimately let it go.  That's a crazy situation for any parent to navigate, I am sure it was a hard choice for them and they did what they thought was best for you.  No one can know if that was ultimately right or wrong.", "NAH.  Your feelings are real and valid, \\*and\\* they did the right thing.  I'm a therapist and two of my most...complicated clients were people who had terminal illnesses in childhood who ended up outliving expectations.\n\nTelling a kid that shit (unless it requires a host of treatments the kid has to brace for and live with) sets the kid up for death as an outcome, not only stealing his future, but stealing his present.  Almost no kids that age are perfectly transcendent, aware of the reality of death but detached from it; it messes with them to receive either message, or both.", "NAH\n\nI can understand why your parents didn\u2019t tell you at 12, especially as they watched you improve and the prognosis was no longer accurate.\n\nI can also understand your feelings now. And it would be unforgivable if it happened now, at your age. But it didn\u2019t. You were still very much a child.\n\nAnd your aunt\u2019s not the AH for telling you, although perhaps the way she did so wasn\u2019t ideal.", "Don't think too badly of your parents. They did what they thought was best - imagine if you'd lived the last ten years being afraid you were going to die soon?\n\nIt's fine to be mad, but don't take it out on them.", "NAH. i can understand hiding that from a 12 year old, and i can understand being shocked to have pertinent information about your life hidden away from you. it sounds like this diagnosis was during a short time period in which you were severely i'll (?) not sure, but if that's true and you decreased in severity not long after then i would honestly say i can understand hiding it for a little while, and then choosing not to reveal it once your health seemed to improve.", "NAH\n\nYour parents are not dismissing you.. you have to understand that for them... \n\nYou were still a child. Burdening you with the idea that you may or may not have long to live would have done nothing for you and made things worse on you. They opted not to say anything so you could have some chance at having normalcy, rather than potentially falling into hopelessness and despair and missing out. \n\nYou were lucky to be able to enjoy that normalcy and grow into adulthood without that worry. And what good would it be to tell you now? Its a wound that probably wont ever heal for your parents. Your parents probably spent so many sleepless and tear filled nights worrying about if you would wake up in the morning, spent so much energy worrying about emergencies you would have at school or at activities while doing everything they could to make things feel as normal for you as possible so you could enjoy your life and be happy. All their efforts paid off and I think that is cause for joy.", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR life. You have every right to know if there\u2019s a chance it could be cut short.", "NTA I get their reasoning, but what if the results were different. Bet they didn't think of that", "YTA they did what they could to make sure you had a normal life. People only have so many years to be carefree children. I think they did what they could to provide you with a childhood. You wouldn't have had as happy as a life thinking you were a ticking time bomb. Edited", "I simply cannot imagine exactly how a parent is supposed to tell a 12 year old they only have ten years to live. I can, however, imagine very clearly that there are staff specially trained to help parents broach this kind of situation and help children start to come to terms, if that's the correct expression, with their own mortality.\n\nWhatever the situation now, they risked denying the older teenage you and the young adult you the opportunity to plan your life according to your life expectancy. To die with life unfulfilled must be miserable indeed. \n\nFrom an outsider's point of view, it would be interesting to know when you received your revised prognosis though, of course, that is no-one's business but your own. \n\nI would say NTA for being mad but don't be too hard on them. They may have done the wrong thing in your eyes but I'm sure they did it for the right reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Talk to your parents and listen to their side of the story. You might gain some insight from\ntheir perspective. Lupus is one of the hardest diseases to diagnose. I am one of those unlucky individuals who had a hard time. You were lucky to find out at a young age. I know it sucks more than a porn star to have this disease and win the prize for the defect in the gene pool but at least you have an idea of what to expect and have knowledge at an early age for the flare ups, pain, fatigue, and everything that goes along with this rotten disease. I never knew what was wrong. I had to call my mother and find out what to do. Lupus is so rampant in my family that it is ridiculous!!!! There are many groups on Facebook to join that can help you understand as well as the lupus website.

But the most a doctor could say about a long-term illness is something like: based on the severity of her illness at this hospitalization and taking into account demographic trends, it\u2019s possible that she could have a reduced life expectancy of only around 10 more years. Any such statement comes with tons of caveats and what-ifs. It is speculative. Not a hard prediction, which would be impossible for even the most brilliant rheumatologist to state accurately. I doubt the veracity of your aunt\u2019s story, and I question what your parents were actually told back then. Medicine changes. Rheumatology in particular has seen many remarkable advances in new therapies and new generation medications. Which is probably something your parents were hoping for at the time of your crisis. Your parents had no obligation to share with you what amounts to a random stab in the dark by some physician who probably only cared for you for a very short time, and who probably wasn\u2019t even a specialist in your illness.

The second is intended to communicate the potential severity of your illness, to get buy-in for the treatment plan, so you could change the medical outcome. \n\ntl;dr: the doctor most likely said your life expectancy **without the proposed treatment plan** was 10 more years.", "NAH.

They chose what they thought was best in the moment.", "The results can change if the person knows they have a chance of dying.

If the patient believes they\u2019ll live, it\u2019s likely they will.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for being upset or emotional\u2026but your parents did the right thing.", "I agree. Sometimes it's medically necessary to keep things from the patient, and mental health is health too. Knowing that you might be dying in 10 years as a kid could have led to depression, anxiety, so many more issues, impacted your will to attend treatment and tons of other issues. If that diagnosis continued when you were older, it would have been a different story, but thankfully, you're ok now. \n\nIn fact, in my country, even doctors will keep the truth from you if your life is endangered sometimes. Even going as far as to consider an adult being treated for severe or potentially mortal injuries unfit to sign consent forms and such (this is mostly in regards to accidents, things suddenly going wrong in routine surgeries, and things like that, not the treatment of long lasting issues like autoimmune diseases or cancer). \n\nI was 22 years old, admitted to the highest level of intensive care unit, with doctors fighting for my life for three days. Not once was I told what exactly is going on, even though I was fully concious and lucid (only my heart was the problem, no issues with cognitive abilities). One of the doctors on my case lied to my face when I asked if there's a possibility of death. Later on, when I was cleared and out of the woods, they told me everything and explained that they could not risk my heart rate spiking up even for a minute, therefore my entire family was warned to act normal and they were considered legally able to allow treatment, even signed a consent form to induce a coma if it becomes necessary.\n\nSo, while it does feel weird to find out you had such tragic diagnosis, and knew nothing of it, try to understand that your parents were probably working with doctors and according to their advice. And while they could and maybe should have told you later on, I assure you the possibility of your kid dying is not something they want to revisit now that everything is ok. It might be good to talk to them, ask for details that you feel you need and get closure that all of you deserve, and hopefully no such situation will arise for you again.", "Lupus or not-no one knows how long they have. Could have died the next day in a car accident, and I wouldn't want my kid worried about their inevitable death. I wouldn't say anything either.", "OP should really thank her parents, because attitude matters so much when it comes to survival.  Sometimes being given a life expectancy takes the fight out of someone, much less a child.", "NAH I double BecauseICanTest on their statement", "NAH. Agree with this. As someone with lupus, I fully understand, and have felt, how significantly stress can impact your condition. Your parents made the correct choice.\n\nBeing told you have a certain length of time left to live is earth shattering for anyone, but can you imagine being a 12 year old and having to process that?\n\nI know that hearing it now is still shocking and that's completely understandable. Take some time to process it, but know that your parents did what was best for you.", "Good to hear from someone with the opposite experience. I think the way your parents handled it is best.", "Hold up here ... I have a friend from college who was born with a heart defect. The doctors estimated that she wouldn't live past 20 (and she knew this). But she \\*wanted\\* to get as far in school as possible so she graduated high school at 17, graduated college at 20, and finished her PhD at 25 (on borrowed time). She's now in her 30s, still alive and healthy, and she got tenure before I even finished my PhD, and she has a kid.\n\nSome kids might react the way you suggest, but others will let it drive them.", "Absolutely. When a patient is given the news they only have X amount of time left to live, they will believe that and most certainly die within that timeframe. That's called the \"Nocebo Effect\". If a patient is given a treatment and told it was going to cure them, the patient believed it would and it almost always cured them. Even if all they were given was a sugar pill. That's called a \"Placebo Effect\". The same holds true for the opposite. If a patient is told during treatment, that there's no hope for getting better, it will almost always be the case. That's called the \"Nocebo Effect\". OP only knew when she was a child that she was getting treatment and it was going to make her better. That's all she needed to know. And it worked.", "NTA. They could have told you at 18yrs.", "NTA but i basically agree with what they did. Obviously that wasn\u2019t a sure thing and it turned out not to be true. But you would have fearful all through those teen years and it\u2019s so much better that you only found out after the danger has somewhat passed.", "NTA but i basically agree with what they did. Obviously that wasn\u2019t a sure thing and it turned out not to be true. But you would have fearful all through those teen years and it\u2019s so much better that you only found out after the danger has somewhat passed.", "NAH. You can't reasonably be expected to hear such news and not feel upset by it. However. You need to seriously think about your parents and how they felt hearing their child had limited time to live. They gave you as normal a childhood as they could--and here you are, ten years later, still with us! This is the best possible outcome. Please work through your anger to a point of understanding.", "There's no reason to tell a 10 year old that they're dying slowly.  To what purpose? What would you have done differently? How would it have helped? \n\nNAH", "NAH \n\nI kinda get where you are coming from.  When I was about the same age I broke my back pretty badly and suffered a couple other injuries.  The doctors told my parents I would never walk again, and was 50/50 for the night.  \n\nOf course no one told me these things.  About six months later I was starting to walk again.  I'm still walking 30+ years later.  Doctors are amazing, but they aren't infallible.  Your parents probably didn't want to scare you or overwhelm you.", "NAH. Your parents were trying to protect their 12 year old child. Thankfully the doctors were wrong. I can get that you\u2019re upset about this, but put yourself in their shoes", "No assholes here. You are right to be angry but they were also right to keep it from you then. Put themselves in their shoes. Its ok to be angry now, in shock of finding the truth, but I am sure you will eventually forgive them. Ofcourse your anger will not make them treat you any worse, They love you, so, think about it a bit. Its great that you are healthy now, thats all your parents wanted to begin with. Better have an angry kid then a dead kid (and yes, even as an adult, to your parents you will always be a kid). Its good that you still have each other. They just protected you from bad news. and I am sure they would have told you later had your condition not improved,", "Why should they tell you? I don't understand why parents would tell a 12yr old she has 10yrs left. Obviously I wasn't true. Noone knows when they are gonna die. Noone. Some get a time frame. Others do not. Yours was wrong", "NAH. It sounds like your prognosis improved, so when they told them 10 years it was probably a shock to them and something they didn't think you'd be able to handle. You're assuming they wouldn't have told you had the prognosis remained the same, but I'm fairly sure your declining health would have given the game away. Your auntie is talking about Old News.", "NTA but your parents aren\u2019t either. This is a complete catch 22 situation. You entitled to your feelings but I think any parent can see their perspective as well.", "NAH\n\nYou have every right to be upset. I totally get it.\n\nBut I also think I would never, ever tell my 12yr old child that they had only a decade of life left. That\u2019s information they don\u2019t have to know, and it could be insanely traumatic to a child who is already hugely stressed by puberty.\n\nI would eventually divulge the earlier diagnosis/prognosis, and probably before my kid turned 22yrs old. But yeah I can absolutely see why your parents did it.", "As an adult with an expiration stamp,  it is absolutely a mindfuck and while you think they did you wrong... I'm gonna go with nope. Life is wretched when you have to face your mortality before your time.  I hope I'm lucky enough to outlive my diagnosis.", "NAH - That's some shocking stuff to hear so I don't really take issue with your reaction. I think your parents did the right thing. \"Oh yeah, maybe 10 years\" from a doctor is them being honest based on statistical relevance. It's complete BS on an individual scale. Everyone knows somebody who got a prognosis like that and was fine. I don't blame your parents one bit for not telling 12 year old \"oh yeah you're going to die by the way\", god they'd be horribly cruel people to do that.", "It\u2019s not inherently wrong to be mad, but I hope you can see how much better you lived your life not straddled with the fear of death in a few years.", "Exactly. Telling a 12 year old they have \"X\" amount of life left will just make the kid go into a depression about life and living to the point that OP would actually drive themselves into death.", "I went to school with a girl who had muscular dystrophy (not sure if that's the right term), she was in a wheelchair and barely able to speak, write or draw. It was always a given that she would die in her teens or early twenties. She finished high school with good grades and went to university for graphic design before she eventually passed away. I basically agree with you, but it's not a given OP would have reacted this way - maybe they would have tried to enjoy the time they had even more.", "Adults really have a right to know their own medical conditions and prognosis", "Could you explain this another way to me? Doctors won\u2019t tell their patients they have a chance of dying? Or they won\u2019t give a time frame of expected death?", "I think (and hope) that they're referring to situations in which the patient COULD die but there's still a good chance they'll live as well. In that case, what they're saying makes sense, and the patient's perception could easily be the deciding factor between life and death. I would HOPE that if a person is pretty much sure to die, they would be told. It seems cruel to give someone false hope", "This is more for longer battles and younger people. It\u2019s more about framing it to be hopeful. Telling a 12 year old they only have 10 years will absolutely destroy their quality of life that they\u2019ve been given. Especially with cases that you can survive\u2014like this one. It was more likely that the Dr said to the parents she wasn\u2019t dying immediately, but it looked more likely than not. So you need to weigh the options on placing the burden of mortality on a tween or waiting a bit to see how things progress. (On both a medical advancement and an individual standpoint) someone who is given no hope is less likely to care about trying to survive and more likely to give up, it\u2019s also wildly traumatic to place it on a young kid like that.", "Doctors will disagree with you too.", "NAH", "I\u2019m sure your parents didn\u2019t want to believe it either.", "NAH\n\npersonal question that has no bearing on the situation, but do you think you'd have lived the past 10 years differently had you thought you'd be six feet under right now?", "Honestly I\u2019d be fuming if it were me. When I was 12 I was already thinking about what kind of home insurance I might have and it would\u2019ve been a blessing to be able to live more in the moment (and a crime to be denied that chance)", "Sounds like NAH, but INFO: when did you get better? Because I understand wanting to protect a 12yo kid (while I also understand how you can feel betrayed by that), but hiding it to a 16yo for example is much less understandable. Did you get better soon after, or not so long ago?", "YTA. \n\nThey didn't tell you a quack life expectancy that was wrong and instead got you health care that has led to you being healthy since then. If they told you, at 12, this would have just led to a worse outcome, since you would have been a child suddenly facing mortality when instead you just needed to rest and get proper medications. Mental and emotional stress can have a very negative effect on healing and can make autoimmune disorders much worse. \n\nYou just don't tell children these things, unless it's like cancer and literally all the fights have been fought and you're letting them know it's okay to go..  \n\nAnd considering how obviously wrong the Dr was, idk why your aunt even brought it up. So, she's an AH too.", "NAH. Hindsight is 20/20. \n\nIn a very traumatic and stressful situation they chose to lie in order to protect their child. They made a choice, and it didn\u2019t really affect you at all. There aren\u2019t consequences to them not telling you, but there could have been extreme consequences telling you. I understand you think you deserved to know, but really think about how different your life could be if you were told as a CHILD you only had a decade to live. \n\nI just don\u2019t see the point in getting more than upset over it. You have every right to feel weird, but you also have no idea what it\u2019s like to be told your child only has a decade to live. They did what they thought was right at the time.", "INFO:\n\nWhat harm has been done to you by this?  Honest question. \n\nHow long was that prognosis in place?  Is it a shock that you're alive now, or when you were 14, did doctors tell them 'holy shit, amazing recovery, he'll be fine?'", "NAH The stress of that would have been immense and likely exacerbated your condition, you were a minor, it was their call, and they made a kind call. I get the shock but it worked out OK, live long and prosper OP, and hug those parents!", "NAH.  This was a tough call.  I can totally see why parents would want to keep this info from their child.  You were 12.  Hearing that you only had 10 years to live could have significantly impacted every decision you made from that moment forward - and not for the better.", "NAH. You\u2019re looking at things from a 22 year old\u2019s perspective. Put yourself in the shoes of a 12 year old. They likely won\u2019t have the mental and emotional capacity to cope with it. They tried to protect you from all that fear and uncertainty and dread. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m glad you beat that prognosis. That\u2019s something worth celebrating!", "NAH. I would have done the same for my children.\n\nI'm not sure why you're so angry though. Is there something else going on where you feel your parents have been dishonest or something?", "My mother worked nursing home and hospice most of her nursing career.  Telling someone they have 10 years to live doesn't make any sense.  I'm sure they heard something along those lines and turned in into that.  No one can tell how long someone has left, they can maybe provide an estimate, but unless you are really close to dying, no one can tell.", "yeah OP has a right to be angry, but I highly doubt OP would've enjoyed his childhood, if they had the fear that it would all be meaningless before they even get a chance to be an adult. Parents did what they thought was right and this is one of the few times you can't fault them for that", "I'm in my 30s now, when I was a kid I knew a handful of kids with cystic fibrosis. I remember being told by my parents what a serious illness it was and that they would probably die by age twenty\u2014 they're all still alive today. Sometimes medicine changes *really* quickly.", "I agree that no one is the asshole, but someone who just figured out that a doctor said they would die around this age would freak anyone out, so I think the \"just move past it\" is a little too much.", "I'm curious when OP's health improved so significantly. If she was 18 with supposedly four more years and they still didn't tell her, that might be different. But it sounds like it all blew over pretty quickly (thankfully!)", "If I found out later in life that I had an estimated 10 years left as a 12 year old, I would be irritated with my parents for letting me live my life normally. I would want to travel and have memorable experiences, not be stuck going to middle school/high school. I understand education would be necessary, but I think I'd love prefer to be home schooled so I can do as much as I can. I can see some parents not wanting to spend that money on traveling and experiences though, mine likely wouldn't.", "What country is this? When dr's want to tell me too much info for my anxiety to handle and don't listen when I tell them I don't want to know \"too much\" they just barrel right along and call it consent.", "And then where would you be when you didn\u2019t die, and were left trying to navigate life as an adult with no education? How would your parents afford all this traveling while working a job that allows them to travel all the time, yet be able to run back home at a moment\u2019s notice to your specialist if your condition worsens? It\u2019s a nice dream, but not very practical.", "Nobody is saying that everyone reacts the same. But they are saying it\u2019s reasonable for the parents to work towards avoiding the worse outcome.", "OP wasn\u2019t an adult, and in those 6 years I bet the prognosis wasn\u2019t the same.", "> If a patient is given a treatment and told it was going to cure them, the patient believed it would and it almost always cured them. Even if all they were given was a sugar pill.\n\nBullshit. Placebo effect isn't magic and doesn't work on shit like lupus or cancer.", "No. Because you won\u2019t live your life how you would. You going to not finish school and die. You couldn\u2019t prepare", "I\u2019m not even sure why a doctor would give such a prognosis unless it\u2019s to say \u201c this will happen unless you take these steps.\u201d", "The placebo effect is strong and worthy of much study but I agree with you completely."]}
