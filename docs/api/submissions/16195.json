This is something huge for you to deal with, and it's totally understandable that you are upset that you didn't know before (and perhaps even more upset that it was your aunt and not your parents who told you).  But. \n\nThink back, if you can, to when you were 12, 13, 14.  Would you really have wanted to know that you weren't expected to live to 25?  Can you imagine how that would have felt?\n\nYour parents wanted you to have a happy life without the burden and expectation that you would die soon.  They wanted you, in short, to be a normal teenager.  And they took on the entire burden of worrying that their beloved child would die far too young, without telling you or apparently even letting it slip at all that you had this horrible prognosis.  I'd call that wonderful parenting, and I applaud them. \n\nNAH", "NAH, they were parents trying to protect a 12 year old.\n\nYou have every right to be angry, but they were trying to make your live happy and not have you live expecting to die. It would be a different ruling if the doctor gave you month to live, but at 10years a lot can happen to extend that indefinitely.", "NAH there's no good way to tell a 12 year old that. That information could have sent you spiraling mentally which would have impacted you physically and could have made you get worse.  \n  \nIf things were looking bad after a while they could have let you in on it to help you prepare but thankfully that didn't have to happen.  \n    \nYou're well within your rights to be upset they withheld that information from you. Can you think of a way to tell a 12 year old they are going to die soon that wouldn't negatively impact their life? Sometimes in life you have to kick hard decisions down the line and hope by the time you revisit them the situation has changed enough to avoid it.  \n  \nAlso you were 12. You weren't exactly going to be out there living the wild life experiencing everything the world has to offer while you still could. You would have been in the exact same place but now angry and scared", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for being mad. They\u2019re not assholes for deciding not to tell their 12 year old that they had 10 years to live. They made that decision because they thought it was in your best interest. You can be mad about it all you want, but it doesn\u2019t change what happened or make them assholes. \n\nSeems like it worked out for the best, considering. You didn\u2019t live in fear of death and you didn\u2019t decline either. A single 10 year estimate is also pretty wishy-washy, I\u2019m sure they were glad you make a full recovery and it wasn\u2019t relevant anymore, and we don\u2019t know when that was.", "I wont say YTAH but imagine being in your parents shoes for a time, how devastated they must've felt back then knowing their child will only live 10 more years and seeing that you got better theres no need to burden you with such news. So not the AH but try to comprehend your parents, there was no bad intentions on their side", "NAH, no one needs to hear they have a certain period to live, especially when it could turn out false.", "If they told you I can imagine an AITA post for you being mad about that. Parents can\u2019t win, especially in situations like this one. \n\nCan\u2019t you guys just be happy you didn\u2019t die?\n\nNo one is the asshole, just move past it.", "NTA but one question would your life been better if you knew.", "NAH I can understand it hurts you now but what they did wasn't to hurt you but to let you have the best 10yrs without fear , Imagine if they did tell you at that age &  how those 10 yrs would have been for you .", "NAH, you have every right to be angry at them. But try to see it from their point of view, they were trying to protect you and give you a good life. So that you can live and not always think about the fact that you might die soon.", "NAH \n\nI understand why your angry as its information that as an adult and adult would have known.\n\nHowever. I fully understand why your parents never told you as a child that you had 10 years to live. \n\nAlso bare in mind the medical professionals didn't disclose this either to you.\n\nTo them, if you truly have 10 years to live, then they didn't want those 10 years with a poor prognosis in everyones minds.\n\nNot telling you probably gave you a chance at somewhat a normal teenage life without that prognosis lingering.", "Nah - I understand you're shocked. But who knows what would be our own reaction facing such a terrible situation? Hopefully we'll never know.\n\nThe only a-holish move here is your parents dismissing your feelings. They could acknowledge them, but it doesn't mean they have to agree with you. Maybe telling you at 12 would have created damages. Look at the bigger picture. Are they usually respectful and trustworthy parents? If so, then put yourself in their shoes as well. If not, the issue goes beyond not telling you 10 years ago.\n\nHappy to know you're healthy today.", "I think a little momentary angst for what is obviously a very heavy situation is understandable, but ultimately let it go.  That's a crazy situation for any parent to navigate, I am sure it was a hard choice for them and they did what they thought was best for you.  No one can know if that was ultimately right or wrong.", "NAH.  Your feelings are real and valid, \\*and\\* they did the right thing.  I'm a therapist and two of my most...complicated clients were people who had terminal illnesses in childhood who ended up outliving expectations.\n\nTelling a kid that shit (unless it requires a host of treatments the kid has to brace for and live with) sets the kid up for death as an outcome, not only stealing his future, but stealing his present.  Almost no kids that age are perfectly transcendent, aware of the reality of death but detached from it; it messes with them to receive either message, or both.", "NAH\n\nI can understand why your parents didn\u2019t tell you at 12, especially as they watched you improve and the prognosis was no longer accurate.\n\nI can also understand your feelings now. And it would be unforgivable if it happened now, at your age. But it didn\u2019t. You were still very much a child.\n\nAnd your aunt\u2019s not the AH for telling you, although perhaps the way she did so wasn\u2019t ideal.", "Don't think too badly of your parents. They did what they thought was best - imagine if you'd lived the last ten years being afraid you were going to die soon?\n\nIt's fine to be mad, but don't take it out on them.", "NAH. i can understand hiding that from a 12 year old, and i can understand being shocked to have pertinent information about your life hidden away from you. it sounds like this diagnosis was during a short time period in which you were severely i'll (?) not sure, but if that's true and you decreased in severity not long after then i would honestly say i can understand hiding it for a little while, and then choosing not to reveal it once your health seemed to improve.", "NAH\n\nYour parents are not dismissing you.. you have to understand that for them... \n\nYou were still a child. Burdening you with the idea that you may or may not have long to live would have done nothing for you and made things worse on you. They opted not to say anything so you could have some chance at having normalcy, rather than potentially falling into hopelessness and despair and missing out. \n\nYou were lucky to be able to enjoy that normalcy and grow into adulthood without that worry. And what good would it be to tell you now? Its a wound that probably wont ever heal for your parents. Your parents probably spent so many sleepless and tear filled nights worrying about if you would wake up in the morning, spent so much energy worrying about emergencies you would have at school or at activities while doing everything they could to make things feel as normal for you as possible so you could enjoy your life and be happy. All their efforts paid off and I think that is cause for joy.", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR life. You have every right to know if there\u2019s a chance it could be cut short.", "NTA I get their reasoning, but what if the results were different. Bet they didn't think of that", "YTA they did what they could to make sure you had a normal life. People only have so many years to be carefree children. I think they did what they could to provide you with a childhood. You wouldn't have had as happy as a life thinking you were a ticking time bomb. Edited", "I simply cannot imagine exactly how a parent is supposed to tell a 12 year old they only have ten years to live. I can, however, imagine very clearly that there are staff specially trained to help parents broach this kind of situation and help children start to come to terms, if that's the correct expression, with their own mortality.\n\nWhatever the situation now, they risked denying the older teenage you and the young adult you the opportunity to plan your life according to your life expectancy. To die with life unfulfilled must be miserable indeed. \n\nFrom an outsider's point of view, it would be interesting to know when you received your revised prognosis though, of course, that is no-one's business but your own. \n\nI would say NTA for being mad but don't be too hard on them. They may have done the wrong thing in your eyes but I'm sure they did it for the right reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Telling a 12 year old they won't make it to 22 will mess with their head.\nAnd OP's anger is valid.\n\nI get this situation, as my whole life I've had the cloud of premature death hanging over me (I was born with an life altering condition) 100's of doctors appointments with 100's of medical professionals treating me like a rare pokemon messed with my head. Being depressed and suicidal by 8, due to many factors, but being told I could get ill again and not many people who've had my condition lived past their 30's.\n\nYes, being informed is important, but having that rain cloud over a child's head messes with you.\n\nPersonally, OP's parents should have sat down with them at 18 and gone over all their medical information, including the prior prognosis.", "NAH your parents tried to protect you as best they could. And I do think, that when the Initial shock wears off you will feel better. Your parents did Not want' for this to become a self-fulfilling prophecy", "NAH. Your not a parent yet, but if you become one someday you will understand. TBH id probably do the same thing they did.", "I don't know which way to go on this. You finding out upset you and that's understandable. But look at it from your parents point of view. You were only 12 at the time. They didn't want their little girl living in fear.", "You are entitled to your feelings but YTA for yelling at your parents. One of the reasons they probably didn\u2019t tell you is that medical prognosis\u2019s like this, especially with such a long forecast, are often inaccurate. Science changes over time, and treatments have become dramatically more effective. Telling you wouldn\u2019t have changed your behaviour or theirs. I", "NAH at 12 you had a disease and were in the hospital. It would have done you no good to know that this might kill you and there are actually studies that show it could have really hurt you. But after you got better or were older enough to handle it, they should have been honest about how seriously sick that you were so you didn't find out like this.", "I disagree, I think parents should have the right to withhold some information from pre teens at least. Considering OP made a full recovery, it\u2019s not like they were sitting on a time bomb for 10 years. I can\u2019t imagine 10 years to live was the prognosis for long anyway, think about how much trauma they saved OP.", "There would\u2019ve been 10 whole years to tell them, with declining health the whole time. It didn\u2019t happen.", "But imagine if OP was staring down death at that 10 year mark and their parents knew that this would happen and never shared it. All their dreams, some of which they could\u2019ve pursued during those ten years, would been foregone. They\u2019d die with regret. Doctors are trained in proper bed-side manners with children too and therapy exists. I think it\u2019s reasonable to say that OP could\u2019ve been folded into their prognosis (with the aforementioned resources in mind) and not have some big traumatic meltdown. I\u2019d imagine that they\u2019d be grateful for their parents\u2019 honesty.", "12 is not a pre-teen but a teen. She could've been more than half way through puberty. \n\n\nAlso, they didn't tell her at 18 either?", "Fair. Idk I was lied to until I was 17 about something less serious (but still very fucked up) so I'm not sure I can vibe with parents lying to their kids. Not about heritage, not about disease, not about fairies who break in and take teeth in exchange for the change under the couch cushions.", "You think OP\u2019s parents never would have told them??? If they were going to die of lupus in 10 years, they would be getting worse, it\u2019s a progressive disease. It\u2019s not something OP\u2019s parents would have been able to hide. But by waiting, instead OP got better and never had to know that some doctor though that they were going to die in 10 years. \n\nThis made up scenario you\u2019re conjuring to justify OP\u2019s parents being an asshole is a. fake and irrelevant and b. Totally without empathy for the parents of a really sick 12 year old who didn\u2019t want to tell them that they\u2019d be sick for the next 10 years until they died.", "I also think 12 and 17 are very different, especially if one is a very very sick 12 year old who has recently been hospitalized and intubated.", "Sorry if I think a patient should be told their full diagnosis??? The fuck? \n\nWhy are you so worked up over this? I see you fighting with everyone else who\u2019s given an \u201cNTA\u201d opinion too. I gave my opinion and my justification. Relax, it\u2019s just a Reddit post. OP will make their decision on their own.", "Clarification: I found out I was being lied to at 17. My mom hid my biological dad from me since forever (\"I didn't think it mattered\" was her logic but my step-dad had been S-assaulting me since age 7 so it did matter.)\n\nAlso, OP was 22 finding out."]}
