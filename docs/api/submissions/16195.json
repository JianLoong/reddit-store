This is something huge for you to deal with, and it's totally understandable that you are upset that you didn't know before (and perhaps even more upset that it was your aunt and not your parents who told you).  But. \n\nThink back, if you can, to when you were 12, 13, 14.  Would you really have wanted to know that you weren't expected to live to 25?  Can you imagine how that would have felt?\n\nYour parents wanted you to have a happy life without the burden and expectation that you would die soon.  They wanted you, in short, to be a normal teenager.  And they took on the entire burden of worrying that their beloved child would die far too young, without telling you or apparently even letting it slip at all that you had this horrible prognosis.  I'd call that wonderful parenting, and I applaud them. \n\nNAH", "NAH, they were parents trying to protect a 12 year old.\n\nYou have every right to be angry, but they were trying to make your live happy and not have you live expecting to die. It would be a different ruling if the doctor gave you month to live, but at 10years a lot can happen to extend that indefinitely.", "NAH there's no good way to tell a 12 year old that. That information could have sent you spiraling mentally which would have impacted you physically and could have made you get worse.  \n  \nIf things were looking bad after a while they could have let you in on it to help you prepare but thankfully that didn't have to happen.  \n    \nYou're well within your rights to be upset they withheld that information from you. Can you think of a way to tell a 12 year old they are going to die soon that wouldn't negatively impact their life? Sometimes in life you have to kick hard decisions down the line and hope by the time you revisit them the situation has changed enough to avoid it.  \n  \nAlso you were 12. You weren't exactly going to be out there living the wild life experiencing everything the world has to offer while you still could. You would have been in the exact same place but now angry and scared", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for being mad. They\u2019re not assholes for deciding not to tell their 12 year old that they had 10 years to live. They made that decision because they thought it was in your best interest. You can be mad about it all you want, but it doesn\u2019t change what happened or make them assholes. \n\nSeems like it worked out for the best, considering. You didn\u2019t live in fear of death and you didn\u2019t decline either. A single 10 year estimate is also pretty wishy-washy, I\u2019m sure they were glad you make a full recovery and it wasn\u2019t relevant anymore, and we don\u2019t know when that was.", "I wont say YTAH but imagine being in your parents shoes for a time, how devastated they must've felt back then knowing their child will only live 10 more years and seeing that you got better theres no need to burden you with such news. So not the AH but try to comprehend your parents, there was no bad intentions on their side", "NAH, no one needs to hear they have a certain period to live, especially when it could turn out false.", "If they told you I can imagine an AITA post for you being mad about that. Parents can\u2019t win, especially in situations like this one. \n\nCan\u2019t you guys just be happy you didn\u2019t die?\n\nNo one is the asshole, just move past it.", "NTA but one question would your life been better if you knew.", "NAH I can understand it hurts you now but what they did wasn't to hurt you but to let you have the best 10yrs without fear , Imagine if they did tell you at that age &  how those 10 yrs would have been for you .", "NAH, you have every right to be angry at them. But try to see it from their point of view, they were trying to protect you and give you a good life. So that you can live and not always think about the fact that you might die soon.", "NAH \n\nI understand why your angry as its information that as an adult and adult would have known.\n\nHowever. I fully understand why your parents never told you as a child that you had 10 years to live. \n\nAlso bare in mind the medical professionals didn't disclose this either to you.\n\nTo them, if you truly have 10 years to live, then they didn't want those 10 years with a poor prognosis in everyones minds.\n\nNot telling you probably gave you a chance at somewhat a normal teenage life without that prognosis lingering.", "Nah - I understand you're shocked. But who knows what would be our own reaction facing such a terrible situation? Hopefully we'll never know.\n\nThe only a-holish move here is your parents dismissing your feelings. They could acknowledge them, but it doesn't mean they have to agree with you. Maybe telling you at 12 would have created damages. Look at the bigger picture. Are they usually respectful and trustworthy parents? If so, then put yourself in their shoes as well. If not, the issue goes beyond not telling you 10 years ago.\n\nHappy to know you're healthy today.", "I think a little momentary angst for what is obviously a very heavy situation is understandable, but ultimately let it go.  That's a crazy situation for any parent to navigate, I am sure it was a hard choice for them and they did what they thought was best for you.  No one can know if that was ultimately right or wrong.", "NAH.  Your feelings are real and valid, \\*and\\* they did the right thing.  I'm a therapist and two of my most...complicated clients were people who had terminal illnesses in childhood who ended up outliving expectations.\n\nTelling a kid that shit (unless it requires a host of treatments the kid has to brace for and live with) sets the kid up for death as an outcome, not only stealing his future, but stealing his present.  Almost no kids that age are perfectly transcendent, aware of the reality of death but detached from it; it messes with them to receive either message, or both.", "NAH\n\nI can understand why your parents didn\u2019t tell you at 12, especially as they watched you improve and the prognosis was no longer accurate.\n\nI can also understand your feelings now. And it would be unforgivable if it happened now, at your age. But it didn\u2019t. You were still very much a child.\n\nAnd your aunt\u2019s not the AH for telling you, although perhaps the way she did so wasn\u2019t ideal.", "Don't think too badly of your parents. They did what they thought was best - imagine if you'd lived the last ten years being afraid you were going to die soon?\n\nIt's fine to be mad, but don't take it out on them.", "NAH. i can understand hiding that from a 12 year old, and i can understand being shocked to have pertinent information about your life hidden away from you. it sounds like this diagnosis was during a short time period in which you were severely i'll (?) not sure, but if that's true and you decreased in severity not long after then i would honestly say i can understand hiding it for a little while, and then choosing not to reveal it once your health seemed to improve.", "NAH\n\nYour parents are not dismissing you.. you have to understand that for them... \n\nYou were still a child. Burdening you with the idea that you may or may not have long to live would have done nothing for you and made things worse on you. They opted not to say anything so you could have some chance at having normalcy, rather than potentially falling into hopelessness and despair and missing out. \n\nYou were lucky to be able to enjoy that normalcy and grow into adulthood without that worry. And what good would it be to tell you now? Its a wound that probably wont ever heal for your parents. Your parents probably spent so many sleepless and tear filled nights worrying about if you would wake up in the morning, spent so much energy worrying about emergencies you would have at school or at activities while doing everything they could to make things feel as normal for you as possible so you could enjoy your life and be happy. All their efforts paid off and I think that is cause for joy.", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR life. You have every right to know if there\u2019s a chance it could be cut short.", "NTA I get their reasoning, but what if the results were different. Bet they didn't think of that", "YTA they did what they could to make sure you had a normal life. People only have so many years to be carefree children. I think they did what they could to provide you with a childhood. You wouldn't have had as happy as a life thinking you were a ticking time bomb. Edited", "I simply cannot imagine exactly how a parent is supposed to tell a 12 year old they only have ten years to live. I can, however, imagine very clearly that there are staff specially trained to help parents broach this kind of situation and help children start to come to terms, if that's the correct expression, with their own mortality.\n\nWhatever the situation now, they risked denying the older teenage you and the young adult you the opportunity to plan your life according to your life expectancy. To die with life unfulfilled must be miserable indeed. \n\nFrom an outsider's point of view, it would be interesting to know when you received your revised prognosis though, of course, that is no-one's business but your own. \n\nI would say NTA for being mad but don't be too hard on them. They may have done the wrong thing in your eyes but I'm sure they did it for the right reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All their dreams, some of which they could\u2019ve pursued during those ten years, would been foregone. They\u2019d die with regret. Doctors are trained in proper bed-side manners with children too and therapy exists.

I had signs and symptoms of lupus starting at the age of 16. Wasn\u2019t fully diagnosed until I was in my mid 40\u2019s. Your parents were trying to protect you from living life like it was your last day every day. They wanted you to have a childhood and live free from the worries of death. Talk to your parents and listen to their side of the story. You might gain some insight from\ntheir perspective. Lupus is one of the hardest diseases to diagnose. I am one of those unlucky individuals who had a hard time. You were lucky to find out at a young age. I know it sucks more than a porn star to have this disease and win the prize for the defect in the gene pool but at least you have an idea of what to expect and have knowledge at an early age for the flare ups, pain, fatigue, and everything that goes along with this rotten disease. I never knew what was wrong. I had to call my mother and find out what to do. Lupus is so rampant in my family that it is ridiculous!!!! There are many groups on Facebook to join that can help you understand as well as the lupus website. I\u2019m sorry that you have this disease but you have the knowledge of having it and knowledge is POWER! Good luck, best wishes, and love coming from a fellow lupus patient! Remember to talk to your parents without judgement!", "No one is TA. As a parent i couldn\u2019t tell my 12 year old that. Your life would\u2019ve been very different if you had known those details xx", "I mean. If you think you're going to die before you turn 21, you live your life differently. Your parents did not hide a diagnosis from you. You were not actively dying. I get that you're angry, it makes sense that you're angry! You feel like you were lied to for your whole life. But if your parents had told you that the doctors said you would die before you could legally drink, it would have negatively affected your mental state and how you lived. \n\nI say this as someone who had a lot of messed up thought patterns as a kid/teen, and as someone who has a friend who was expected to die before they turned eighteen: you did not need to know. It would have hurt you to know You're not the asshole for being upset right now, but your parents aren't the assholes for not letting you know the exact details of your prognosis. \n\nNAH.", "NAH\n\nObviously your parents were trying to ensure you have you have at least some semblance of normalcy in childhood when faced with a stark future that the doctors told them. Even so, your anger toward them for withholding key information about your health is valid and proper, especially involving lupus.", "My parents didn't tell me that at age 8 I was expected to die of whooping cough (get your kids vaccinated, folks) until many years later. I am quite glad they didn't tell me at the time.", "I can understand why you're annoyed, but I got to say as a parent I probably would have done exactly what your parents did because they did what they did out of love not malice.\n\nAlso Doctors can be wrong, I worked as a support worker (care worker) and his parents were told he'd never reach 2yrs old, then it was 7yrs, then it was 13yrs then it was 20yrs because of his condition, he made it 25 but died of pneumonia, he had a low immune system.\n\nThey wanted to make sure childhood was filled with love and happiness, don't begrudge then for that.\n\nNAH", "I mean, your parents did what Parents should, protected you.  12-year-old you and a 22-year-old are two different people.", "NTA. \n\nI was very very sick as a kid with heart and lung problems. I had a similar prognosis but I\u2019ve beaten every milestone the doctors ever gave me. Things have advanced and changed so much in pediatric medicine. My parents were always 100% up front with me about everything. They started involving me in decision making early on. They still pushed me to live my best life. They made sure I had access to therapy and whatever else I needed to process what was happening. They were always honest when I asked if I was dying - sometimes the answer really was yes. I had an experimental surgery at 18 that drastically changed my life and health for the better. They didn\u2019t want to take the risk, but I did, and they supported me 100%. \n\nI would be devastated if they had hid me from reality. I don\u2019t think that is the healthy way to deal with it.", "Do you really think 12 year old you would want to think you only had 10 years to live?

Because if they pretended everything was fine and dandy and ignored giving you better medicine, that would have been truly asshole-ish.\n\nYour parents would have dug themselves into a bigger hole if the doctor's prediction was right. IF you had realized this lie while you were dying, thinking you were going to be all right, it would have been a whole 'nother story.\n\nYour parents have gambled with the information they were given, and they've won. I'm not saying the situation wasn't easy on them - a white lie can be more comforting than this horrible truth, especially with one's own child. Some situations have no easy answers, and it depends on the intention.", "Sometimes, positive outlook is important.   If they told you you were gonna die, maybe you'd make it happen.  NTA but try to think of it from their view as well.", "A lot of bad could have happened to you mentally, if, you spent your teenage years expecting to die. I speak from partial experience. \n\nOn top of that, your physical health would not have faired as well if you didn't mentally believe in it.\n\nThey probably still cry some days knowing they kept it from you, but they would have shed many more tears imaging their kid growing up, not seeing the point in bothering, probably wanting to try everything while they think they still can. Imagining the scene that would play had they told you, then you survived with wasted youth...\n\nLet them know they did the right thing before their time comes if you can.", "Yeah, honestly, not something I would have told a kid or even an adult either. 10 years is a long time and anything can happen in that time. A child having to live like she is going to die is awful. OP think of all the things you would not have done if you thought you would be dead at 22. Would you have bothered to go to college (if you did), would you have bothered to graduate high school or bothered to get good grades? Would you be trying for any type of career? You would have been so depressed and unhappy for the last ten years. And honestly, being told you would die could have become a self fulfilling prophecy. If you thought you were dying you may not have lived, emotionally or literally.", "Yeah, I feel like the parents could have worked with a therapist on the best way to tell their child. It might not have been when OP was 12 (because hope can be important), but OP should NOT have found through their aunt. If they didn't want to tell OP, they shouldn't have told other relatives. They should have spoken to a therapist.", "Why tell her at 18 if the prognosis changed during the previous 6 years? Being told what doctors thought 6 years earlier when it no longer applies is pointless."]}
