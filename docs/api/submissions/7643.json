He thinks YOU are the problem in the marriage, and he expected the therapist to be on his side. Expect to be told that everything is your fault by him, and pretty soon he will refuse to go to therapy at all.", "NTA\n\nYou're going to couples therapy for a reason. All cards need to be on the table. If his mental health is part of your problems then it needs to be discussed. Him withholding the information doesn't help anything. He should have provided that info himself but chose not to. He's an AH and isn't on board with the couples therapy from the sounds of it.", "Ya, WTF. He's trying to participate in couple's therapy- that's the very definition of a place where you share your mental health history and current treatment plan. Dude's gonna have a hard time getting effective therapy if he keeps that game up.", "Yta.", "NTA. For therapy to work all facts are needed, honesty I think is the key word for therapy to work. Also if your husband suffers with depression or any condition similar then your therapist need to know to better adress and treat the situation that get you guys there in the first place.", "NTA.  This was the perfect time to talk about it, you aren't chatting up a stranger on the street. And you suggesting he see a psychiatrist is not diagnosing him.  It's suggesting there might be a problem and that he should see a qualified person to talk to about it.  Believing there's a problem with his antidepressants (whether it's the efficacy or if he needs to change prescriptions) **is** a marital problem - depression can have significant effect on the spouse and marriage, as well.  \n\nI think you should address this when you are both calm and explain that (I am guessing from the way you wrote your post) you are concerned about him and concerned about the effect this is having on you working together as a couple.", "NTA. If you had disclosed this to your husband's personal therapist then there would be a privacy issue. But the reality is you are in couples therapy. Your therapist should know the whole story and your husband wasn't giving it.  This therapist is still bound to confidentiality and if his mental health struggles affect you then it is pertinent info.", "I'm going with ESH. I can see why you're in couple's therapy and I'm glad you are. Both of you are talking around each other.\n\n1. No, ideally, you don't disclose anyone's medical information to anyone unless you have their express permission\n2. I hope your husband understands that *the therapist* is someone who should know that he has his own personal mental health issues.\n3. Having depression and seeing a psychiatrist doesn't mean there's anything wrong with someone, I don't know why your husband thinks that\n4. You are not legally obligated to keep your husband's medical information private. Any time someone says this, I don't know, it just raises a flag for me. This is the kind of thing that anti-vax conspiracists like to say.", "NTA. Going to couple\u2019s therapy implies that he would be ok with you talking about the issues affecting the relationship, INCLUDING medical issues. It\u2019s pointless to go but ignore issues or have some off limits.", "YTA\n\nThe therapist knowing this information is important and could really help the issues you are both having and I see you just want the best outcome from this situation. However, your husband is right, that was his information to share when he was ready, it is his private medical information and only he should decide who knows about it and when.\n\nIn my opinion you steam rolled him to get the information to the therapist when it would have been more constructive to build up to him feeling ready to share this information himself.", "YTA you don't ever disclose someone else's medical information unless it's a life or death situation. apologise and promise to respect his boundaries in future.", "I don't think YTA, I just think you took the wrong approach. Maybe before the session you could've discussed it with your husband. Like hey maybe we should bring this up and see if the therapist finds the info useful. Some of those drugs lead to intimacy issues and make people dulled down to control their depression. That could be necessary info for the therapist. Butttttt you being the one to just blurt it out was not right.", "YTA, it's not up to you to disclose his medical information. On top off that, it makes your husband feel as if you're shifting all responsibility of the issues to his depressive state. Which might be true, but if it is, the right approach is to support your husband and NOT degrade him in a couples therapy.", "Personally, I'd say yes.\n\nThat information was personal and not for you to share.\n\nI get you had good intentions but i do think it was bit sneaky or at least a misjudgement.", "yta, i see why you two are in couples counseling....", "NTA - medical history is important in this case, and I assume the therapist cannot disclose the info to anyone else.", "Seems to be an unpopular opinion but NTA. I would assume going to couples therapy that it is a safe space to talk about anything in your relationship unless otherwise discussed (but in that case if there are things you can\u2019t talk about how effective will it be) Anyway, in order for therapy to work you have to be vulnerable and talk about difficult topics in your relationship\u2026.but how can you do that if you have to tip toe around certain topics? And the reality is that your partners mental health probably effects you too\u2026so how can you talk about how you are feeling about any of those things if you\u2019re not allowed to talk about them? So I guess my opinion is if you\u2019re in couples therapy everything should be fair game. And if there are certain topics that are just to hard to talk about then maybe that person would benefit from individual therapy to process them so they are able to talk about them. Hope that all makes sense.", "NTA, this is a health care professional. It's irresponsible to not mention it.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your information to share. Not at all. You shouldn't have said anything and while the therapist mightve needed to know, IT'S NOT YOURS TO SHARE. \n\nIt's normal to have to warm up to a therapist.. You should've let him speak on his own time.", "ESH \n\nYou should share personal medical information \n\nHe was in a situation where that information was relevant, and should have volunteered it", "ESH\n\nWhy are you answering for your husband? Once he became defensive about your statements of his behavior you or the therapist should have switched back to him to disclose his relevant medical information. \n\nWhy is your husband attending couples therapy if he\u2019s not planning to be honest about himself? There\u2019s no point in him being there. Not sure what you\u2019re expecting to happen but it\u2019s going to be pretty challenging to achieve your goals without your partner\u2019s participation.\n\neta \u2014 btw I\u2019m including the therapist in my judgment. She should have been the one to put pressure on your husband to answer for himself. She put you in an awkward spot.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And he said nothing.   He admitted in private he is depressed.   He was being defensive and dishonest, and I honestly felt offended by his behavior.   I see a psychiatrist- does he think I\u2019m some kind of whack job?  I recognize I may be the asshole but feel very discouraged about us", "I would go to individual counseling. You are not the \"problem\" but you need to build up coping skills and self-protection skills so that his ridiculous gaslighting attempts don't work on you anymore. You deserve an affirming therapy experience and if he isn't contributing to that then you're better off going without him. (And frankly, I hope individual therapy gets you strong enough to leave him. He sounds like someone you do not need to be married to.)", "The best of yourself that you can give to anyone is your authenticity. Be open in therapy about your hopes and your fears, about the recriminations you got from your husband afterwards, about how that made you feel. He doesn\u2019t want to talk about himself, but he is supposed to be HALF the marriage! The most you can show is \u201cthis my half, this is what I put in\u201d, and if he refuses to match you, he ain\u2019t putting in his half, and he expects you to do it all. Whether or not that is the actual case in your marriage will become clearer as you progress in therapy. The therapist will try to remain neutral and objective, so don\u2019t expect them to reprimand your husband or anything, but you yourself WILL be able to see the patterns emerging by talking it out with a neutral third party. At the end of the day, if you find out he\u2019s not invested in this relationship with you, you can at least tell yourself that you gave it your best shot. You did all the things you could do to try and evolve the relationship to where it needed to be. You just have to realize that you can\u2019t take it there all by yourself, it requires equal effort from both sides. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, and make sure you have a separate bank account and your income goes to that, not into a joint account.", "NAH\n\nYou can\u2019t read your therapist\u2019s mind, so chances are you\u2019re projecting on your therapist what YOU think is going on\u2026\n\nYour therapist\u2019s job is to be an objective third party. They are not judge, jury, or attorney.\n\nRemind your husband of this, and that your therapist isn\u2019t looking to single out a person as being the \u201cproblem\u201d. Your therapist\u2019s #1 goal is probably to help you with your communication.\n\nIf your husband has depression and is on psychiatric medication, then YES, that will affect your relationship dynamic, and it\u2019s important your therapist knows about it. \n\nThat said, this whole conversation about whether you should have told the therapist - that\u2019s also a good conversation to have in front of the therapist. If he asked you not to tell them ahead of time, then you violated his boundaries, etc\u2026", "I definitely get what you're saying. But I will also just say in general that terms like \"implied consent\", \"legally protected\"--these terms are simply not relevant when it comes to individuals discussing personal medical history. This type of legal terminology really only applies to entities such as health care providers, insurers, etc. When it comes to individuals, health information is the same as any other type of information. You can share someone else's secret if you want to, though you certainly might be an AH for doing so.", "Your husband isnt someone who couples therapy is going to work with if he cant be honest with the therapist.", "I am sorry you are in such a difficult situation, I can see why you would be discouraged. Depression is debilitating and all consuming, loving somebody with depression is one fo the hardest things a person can deal with, especially if you have other stuff going on in the relationship. I feel for you I really do.\n\nPlease know that his feelings about his own depression do not necessarily reflect how he feels about you seeing a psychiatrist, people tend to have more empathy and understanding for others than they do themselves. I have worked with people who say they feel weak and unlovable because they have a mental illness and when I ask them if they view others with a mental illness in that way and they usually say \"of course not, they just need help\". \n\nMaybe in the future, if you run into a similar issue, mention that there is something your husband will not disclose but that you feel is important to discuss in couples therapy and maybe the therapist can organise a way to help your husband disclose this himself, that way he may become more comfortable sharing other things in the future. Being honest about mental illness is a difficult process. \n\nHowever, if something is going on that may put your husband or others at risk of harm, do tell the therapist, that is a different situation. \n\nMeanwhile, please reach out to support groups for family/loved ones of people with depression, you should not deal with this alone and remember to look after yourself first and foremost, I hope things get better OP.", "I didn't intend it as a legal term.

If you go in thinking you are not the issue, then you will not get far. If you both go in with the mindset that you both need help then you will have a much stronger chance to succeed. I feel that your spouse is not in this to save the marriage, but only because he was told/encouraged to go.\n\nIdeally your spouse needed to provide that information, not you, but he was clearly not going to share it so this is why I say you are NTA (when I started reading I thought I was going to say yta, but it is not the case). This is information your therapist should know so that they can better understand the relationship and behavioristic dynamics between you two.\n\nYou would typically provide this information when you fill out the new patient forms about any medications you take, especially ones that impact your mental health. \n\nI think your therapist would be good to set up individual sessions for you guys (especially for the husband) to be able to get the best results. Good luck OP", "NTA- In most family/couple's therapy- there are (hopefully written) agreements that when you are in session together, you are allowed to talk freely about any information know to you or know to both of you (or all family members). It is not considered Protected Health Information if it is know to you, and him, and relevant to the treatment in therapy- I would assume the therapist's service agreement/privacy policy outlines this. \n\nIf you are not in your own individual therapy- I recommend you do so. It sounds like your husband wants YOU to be the identified patient in the room, and lie about himself being in treatment.", "NTA", "She can\u2019t help if she doesn\u2019t have all the information.

It's directly relevant to your relationship, so your therapist should know about it.", "ESH. Yay for couples' therapy but you should've let him tell HIS OWN medical/depression info. Maybe he wasn't ready to tell it right then and there.", "ESH.\n\nYes, it's information that needs to be disclosed.  No, it's not your information to disclose.  You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink, and you can lead somebody to mental health support, but you can't make them engage.\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that this whole 'I'm going to do what I want, regardless of my husband's spoken preference or consent' is part of the whole issue.", "It\u2019s not your history don\u2019t share it YTA", "Sorry, you're somehow turning 'wife reveals husband's medical history without his consent' into the husband doing something wrong?", "He needs to be ready to accept the help and part of that being willing to hear the hard things. Being willing to be told that you're not perfect especially when you are someone who sees yourself as blameless and everyone else is the problem. Because those people don't realize that actually it's the opposite - THEY'RE the problem, THEY'RE the constant in all these situations. Therapy isn't a magic wand to fix your problems if you're not willing to face them head on. The therapist can only help you reframe your thinking and destroy negative cyclic thought patterns but the rest is up to the person seeking help to employ those techniques in their everyday life. If he's not there yet you might aswell stop wasting your money.", "Not \u201cmedical history\u201d as in *an embarrassing rash*.

If he chooses not to disclose this, and thereby to not engage in the therapy in good faith, well, now she has more information on hand to decide how to proceed with the relationship, or not proceed with the relationship.\n\nTherapy is about feeling comfortable to talk, and it's hard to feel comfortable when you'll just be spoken on behalf of.", "Not neccesarily true. He might have been willing to engage in good faith, but is scared of the stigma. Getting a guy to talk about stuff like that demands a high level of trust to begin with, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s unwilling.\n\nIn an ideal situation, the therapist gently explains why it\u2019s best to reveal all the facts, laying out how he can benefit from doing so. \n\nUnfortunately in this case, we have the wife and the therapist talking over and around him, which isnt conducive to him engaging in the process. Why would he trust either of them now?\n\nFrankly I think the therapist is the real asshole here - as a professional, they should know better."]}
