All cards need to be on the table. If his mental health is part of your problems then it needs to be discussed. Him withholding the information doesn't help anything. He should have provided that info himself but chose not to. He's an AH and isn't on board with the couples therapy from the sounds of it.", "Ya, WTF. He's trying to participate in couple's therapy- that's the very definition of a place where you share your mental health history and current treatment plan. Dude's gonna have a hard time getting effective therapy if he keeps that game up.", "Yta.", "NTA. For therapy to work all facts are needed, honesty I think is the key word for therapy to work. Also if your husband suffers with depression or any condition similar then your therapist need to know to better adress and treat the situation that get you guys there in the first place.", "NTA.  This was the perfect time to talk about it, you aren't chatting up a stranger on the street. And you suggesting he see a psychiatrist is not diagnosing him.  It's suggesting there might be a problem and that he should see a qualified person to talk to about it.  Believing there's a problem with his antidepressants (whether it's the efficacy or if he needs to change prescriptions) **is** a marital problem - depression can have significant effect on the spouse and marriage, as well.  \n\nI think you should address this when you are both calm and explain that (I am guessing from the way you wrote your post) you are concerned about him and concerned about the effect this is having on you working together as a couple.", "NTA. If you had disclosed this to your husband's personal therapist then there would be a privacy issue. But the reality is you are in couples therapy. Your therapist should know the whole story and your husband wasn't giving it.

I can see why you're in couple's therapy and I'm glad you are. Both of you are talking around each other.\n\n1. No, ideally, you don't disclose anyone's medical information to anyone unless you have their express permission\n2. I hope your husband understands that *the therapist* is someone who should know that he has his own personal mental health issues.\n3. Having depression and seeing a psychiatrist doesn't mean there's anything wrong with someone, I don't know why your husband thinks that\n4. You are not legally obligated to keep your husband's medical information private. Any time someone says this, I don't know, it just raises a flag for me. This is the kind of thing that anti-vax conspiracists like to say.", "NTA.

Maybe before the session you could've discussed it with your husband. Like hey maybe we should bring this up and see if the therapist finds the info useful. Some of those drugs lead to intimacy issues and make people dulled down to control their depression. That could be necessary info for the therapist. Butttttt you being the one to just blurt it out was not right.", "YTA, it's not up to you to disclose his medical information. On top off that, it makes your husband feel as if you're shifting all responsibility of the issues to his depressive state. Which might be true, but if it is, the right approach is to support your husband and NOT degrade him in a couples therapy.", "Personally, I'd say yes.\n\nThat information was personal and not for you to share.\n\nI get you had good intentions but i do think it was bit sneaky or at least a misjudgement.", "yta, i see why you two are in couples counseling....", "NTA - medical history is important in this case, and I assume the therapist cannot disclose the info to anyone else.", "Seems to be an unpopular opinion but NTA. I would assume going to couples therapy that it is a safe space to talk about anything in your relationship unless otherwise discussed (but in that case if there are things you can\u2019t talk about how effective will it be) Anyway, in order for therapy to work you have to be vulnerable and talk about difficult topics in your relationship\u2026.but how can you do that if you have to tip toe around certain topics? And the reality is that your partners mental health probably effects you too\u2026so how can you talk about how you are feeling about any of those things if you\u2019re not allowed to talk about them? So I guess my opinion is if you\u2019re in couples therapy everything should be fair game. And if there are certain topics that are just to hard to talk about then maybe that person would benefit from individual therapy to process them so they are able to talk about them. Hope that all makes sense.", "NTA, this is a health care professional. It's irresponsible to not mention it.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your information to share. Not at all.

The most you can show is \u201cthis my half, this is what I put in\u201d, and if he refuses to match you, he ain\u2019t putting in his half, and he expects you to do it all. Whether or not that is the actual case in your marriage will become clearer as you progress in therapy. The therapist will try to remain neutral and objective, so don\u2019t expect them to reprimand your husband or anything, but you yourself WILL be able to see the patterns emerging by talking it out with a neutral third party. At the end of the day, if you find out he\u2019s not invested in this relationship with you, you can at least tell yourself that you gave it your best shot. You did all the things you could do to try and evolve the relationship to where it needed to be.

I have worked with people who say they feel weak and unlovable because they have a mental illness and when I ask them if they view others with a mental illness in that way and they usually say \"of course not, they just need help\". \n\nMaybe in the future, if you run into a similar issue, mention that there is something your husband will not disclose but that you feel is important to discuss in couples therapy and maybe the therapist can organise a way to help your husband disclose this himself, that way he may become more comfortable sharing other things in the future. Being honest about mental illness is a difficult process. \n\nHowever, if something is going on that may put your husband or others at risk of harm, do tell the therapist, that is a different situation. \n\nMeanwhile, please reach out to support groups for family/loved ones of people with depression, you should not deal with this alone and remember to look after yourself first and foremost, I hope things get better OP.", "I didn't intend it as a legal term.

It's couples counseling. \n\nWhen you go to couples counseling you share all relivant information. \n\nThat's like a spouse saying \"I will go with you but don't talk about the problems we are having.\" Or \"don't talk about our sex life.\" \n\nThere are problems in the marriage. Depression, if treated uneffectivly could be a contributing factor. \n\nAlso it could change the advice given. Someone staying in bed all day could be laziness and would be delt with entirely differently than a depressive episode. \n\nAbusivers are the ones that try to muzzle their spouse, because they don't want all the facts known.", "No. She should have let him tell her.", "And if he didn\u2019t tell the therapist? There\u2019s literally no point in them going. If you go to couple\u2019s therapy you can\u2019t control what the other person says, so if he didn\u2019t want the therapist to know some stuff then he either a) should have explicitly told his wife that or b) not agreed to go. The point of therapy is you can tell them everything without judgement", "I understand that but she shouldn't have spoken for him.", "You keep saying she violated his privacy. She didn\u2019t. Couples therapy is understood and generally signed off on by both parties as a full disclosure environment.", "I get where you are coming from but also if her speaking for him is a recurring issue then now the therapist will be able to identify that so it can be worked on", "I disagree with you - based on my own experience in couples therapy where this situation went down. Therapist confirmed that sharing the other person has a diagnosis they aren\u2019t managing which is severely harmful to the relationship is kosher. Therapist should then ask husband why he is withholding info, or ask if he wants to elaborate, but ultimately the wife is not out of bounds giving this context to the counselor. It is necessary and husband doesn\u2019t get to draw boundaries around what others share, only his own reactions. Wife is part of a legal contract (marriage) where MI can impact shared finances, safety, etc. Wife is absolutely ethically obligated to share full context. If hubby isn\u2019t on board he should not have joined couples therapy - the expectation there is that all information is provided, and that expectation is generally signed during intake paperwork.\n\nAnd while your PPD example is also valid, my pregnancy one isn\u2019t inaccurate. Any condition a person has which is negatively impacting their partner is absolutely fair grounds in couple\u2019s therapy.", "You didn't say he may not have wanted to be there, you said he might not have agreed. He obviously agreed, regardless of whatever feelings he might have had.", "Unpopular judgement, but YTA. Therapist asked about his behavior, so you immediately go to \"I think he should be seeing a psychiatrist\"? How is that supposed to be taken as anything but an attack?\n\nBased on your post, you didn't say \"he shuts down and doesn't seem to be able to do X, I'm concerned he needs help\", you said \"he's been on these drugs for ten years, I think he needs to see a psychiatrist\". No justification beyond that he's on antidepressants. It sounds like you used the therapy session as an opportunity to attack him about a medical issue.", "How is that really going to work in practice? Couples' therapy is going to be FULL of potentially sensitive issues. The wife - or the husband, for that matter - is not going to be able to clear every single possible disclosure before going in to the therapist's office. Maybe you can schedule one issue to discuss per session - but if something comes up spontaneously, it would really affect communication to have to stop and say, \"I know this is couple's therapy, but can we stop for a minute while I go out and ask spouse if I'm allowed to mention this certain issue that I'm really worried about but not sure I'm permitted to speak of?\" - and just shut down the session and go out while you argue in the corridor with spouse about whether it's okay if you talk about the impotence problem, or the drinking problem, or the unemployment, or the firing, and so forth.\n\nIf you go into couples' therapy, it is by DEFINITION the revealing of private matters.", "If you see someone with an injured ankle and go to \"I think you should go to the ER and get that X-rayed to see if it's a break?\"...how is that supposed to be taken as an attack and not an expression of concern? Why do you think recommending a psychiatrist is different and denigrating?", "That's kind of like saying that when a couple is going to the same doctor to treat the case of genital warts they both have, the wife shouldn't mention that her husband was treated for syphilis in the past. The diagnosis affects them both, the treating professional needs to know the full history to evaluate both cases.", "If he\u2019s not willing to engage with counseling in good faith, including his mental health struggles that are impacting the marriage, the marriage is already over and they are wasting time and money.", "Are you me?\n\nMy husband didn't blow up or get mad but when I brought up in couples counseling that I think he should see a pysch doctor instead of getting his meds from his pcp as he has been for all these years (they are not working) he said it wasn't my business. Ok it's not my business but it is part of our marital problems, so I am going to address the issue with our marriage counselor.\n\nI know he's hesitant to change meds because he saw the ups and downs of my like 3 year journey to find my sweet spot of meds and he doesn't want to expend that type of energy on it.\n\nNTA \n\nBesides how is the couples counseling going to work if they don't have all the pertinent information?", "The only way he would be in the right is if the therapist shared PHI with the wife, without the husband's consent. Not the other way around.", "??? She's his wife, not a random stranger off the street judging him for his antidepressant use. I assume she has been exposed to his moods and behaviors for a long time. If she thinks he needs to see a psychiatrist and he is ignoring her suggestion, it's extremely valid to bring this topic up in couples therapy so that they can work towards a solution. Whether that solution results in the husband actually going to a psychiatrist is irrelevant. It's clearly a pain point in their relationship. Talking these things out is what therapy is for.", "You husband is wrong about you being subject to any laws regarding his medical records (be they mental or physical diagnoses). \n\nYour therapist, any psychiatrist, other health care providers and health insurance are subject to the federal HIPAA privacy & security regulations as well as all similar health record laws in your State. \n\nThose laws do NOT apply to YOU, unless you are a health care provider too. You violated no law by discussing his diagnoses, problems or prescriptions with your therapist.\n\nIf you have specific questions about HIPAA, please ask me, it\u2019s been my career since the regulations were promulgated years ago.\n\nNTA. Best wishes with your husband.", "I took antidepressants for a while that KILLED my libido.  I didn't even want to jack off (and god I love jacking off). \n\nIf my husband and I had gone to counseling, and he mentioned that I didn't give him sex anymore, and the therapist asked me why, and I kept giving non-answers, or lied, or danced around the truth, and my husband finally gave the actual reason why, I wouldn't feel it was a betrayal or anything of the sort.  Because that *was* the root cause.  It would save a lot of wasted time.\n\nIf my husband started the session with \"we don't have sex anymore because of some medications he takes\", even if he said which meds, and why, I *still* wouldn't feel anything other than the fact that he was just starting off by mentioning the main issue/cause of us needing the counseling. \n\nThen we could work from there.  I feel like hiding something crucial is just asking to fail.", "Contrary to the label, I think you should have discussed it with you husband beforehand. It may be relevant to the session but that was up to him to decide and to tell.\n\nIf I read this story, it looks as if you're trying to use his psychiatric condition as a way to validate your problems with him in the relationship. After all, he has psychiatric problems. It might not be the case, but I can understand his issue with that tactic and imho it will not help to solve problems (disclaimer: am not a therapist). \n\nSo yeah, I think you should apologise for not discussing it before giving his information (I'll reserve the AH-word for more serious things). The information might be very relevant or necessary for the therapy, but it was not yours to disclose..", "YTA, it just seems wrong to tell the therapist something about your husband which he didn't want to tell her.", "I see things similar this all the time in the hospital. Patients come in wanting to get better but refuse to take the steps necessary to make it happen.", "This gave me SO much validation. My ex and I went to counseling, and I told them about his current mental state (unaliving), and he got pissed at me about it. It wasn't cheap, and in the end, he's an ex for a reason. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I still feel bad about it til this day, but your comment helped immensely. Thank you!", "Yeah, seriously, there is no law saying your wife can't talk about your medical conditions. Can you imagine? How would that even work?", "So OP should lie and keep secrets from the therapist to allow her husband to refuse to engage with therapy? Why the fuck would they even go to therapy if she's expected to keep quiet about their problems?", "That's one reason I wish the op had given more context about how they had given the info and more detail about how long they had been in therapy."]}
