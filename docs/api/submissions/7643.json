All cards need to be on the table. If his mental health is part of your problems then it needs to be discussed. Him withholding the information doesn't help anything. He should have provided that info himself but chose not to. He's an AH and isn't on board with the couples therapy from the sounds of it.", "Ya, WTF. He's trying to participate in couple's therapy- that's the very definition of a place where you share your mental health history and current treatment plan. Dude's gonna have a hard time getting effective therapy if he keeps that game up.", "Yta.", "NTA. For therapy to work all facts are needed, honesty I think is the key word for therapy to work. Also if your husband suffers with depression or any condition similar then your therapist need to know to better adress and treat the situation that get you guys there in the first place.", "NTA.  This was the perfect time to talk about it, you aren't chatting up a stranger on the street. And you suggesting he see a psychiatrist is not diagnosing him.  It's suggesting there might be a problem and that he should see a qualified person to talk to about it.  Believing there's a problem with his antidepressants (whether it's the efficacy or if he needs to change prescriptions) **is** a marital problem - depression can have significant effect on the spouse and marriage, as well.  \n\nI think you should address this when you are both calm and explain that (I am guessing from the way you wrote your post) you are concerned about him and concerned about the effect this is having on you working together as a couple.", "NTA. If you had disclosed this to your husband's personal therapist then there would be a privacy issue. But the reality is you are in couples therapy. Your therapist should know the whole story and your husband wasn't giving it.

I can see why you're in couple's therapy and I'm glad you are. Both of you are talking around each other.\n\n1. No, ideally, you don't disclose anyone's medical information to anyone unless you have their express permission\n2. I hope your husband understands that *the therapist* is someone who should know that he has his own personal mental health issues.\n3. Having depression and seeing a psychiatrist doesn't mean there's anything wrong with someone, I don't know why your husband thinks that\n4. You are not legally obligated to keep your husband's medical information private. Any time someone says this, I don't know, it just raises a flag for me. This is the kind of thing that anti-vax conspiracists like to say.", "NTA.

However, your husband is right, that was his information to share when he was ready, it is his private medical information and only he should decide who knows about it and when.\n\nIn my opinion you steam rolled him to get the information to the therapist when it would have been more constructive to build up to him feeling ready to share this information himself.", "YTA you don't ever disclose someone else's medical information unless it's a life or death situation. apologise and promise to respect his boundaries in future.", "I don't think YTA, I just think you took the wrong approach. Maybe before the session you could've discussed it with your husband. Like hey maybe we should bring this up and see if the therapist finds the info useful. Some of those drugs lead to intimacy issues and make people dulled down to control their depression. That could be necessary info for the therapist. Butttttt you being the one to just blurt it out was not right.", "YTA, it's not up to you to disclose his medical information. On top off that, it makes your husband feel as if you're shifting all responsibility of the issues to his depressive state. Which might be true, but if it is, the right approach is to support your husband and NOT degrade him in a couples therapy.", "Personally, I'd say yes.\n\nThat information was personal and not for you to share.\n\nI get you had good intentions but i do think it was bit sneaky or at least a misjudgement.", "yta, i see why you two are in couples counseling....", "NTA - medical history is important in this case, and I assume the therapist cannot disclose the info to anyone else.", "Seems to be an unpopular opinion but NTA. I would assume going to couples therapy that it is a safe space to talk about anything in your relationship unless otherwise discussed (but in that case if there are things you can\u2019t talk about how effective will it be) Anyway, in order for therapy to work you have to be vulnerable and talk about difficult topics in your relationship\u2026.but how can you do that if you have to tip toe around certain topics? And the reality is that your partners mental health probably effects you too\u2026so how can you talk about how you are feeling about any of those things if you\u2019re not allowed to talk about them? So I guess my opinion is if you\u2019re in couples therapy everything should be fair game. And if there are certain topics that are just to hard to talk about then maybe that person would benefit from individual therapy to process them so they are able to talk about them. Hope that all makes sense.", "NTA, this is a health care professional. It's irresponsible to not mention it.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your information to share. Not at all.

The most you can show is \u201cthis my half, this is what I put in\u201d, and if he refuses to match you, he ain\u2019t putting in his half, and he expects you to do it all. Whether or not that is the actual case in your marriage will become clearer as you progress in therapy. The therapist will try to remain neutral and objective, so don\u2019t expect them to reprimand your husband or anything, but you yourself WILL be able to see the patterns emerging by talking it out with a neutral third party. At the end of the day, if you find out he\u2019s not invested in this relationship with you, you can at least tell yourself that you gave it your best shot. You did all the things you could do to try and evolve the relationship to where it needed to be. You just have to realize that you can\u2019t take it there all by yourself, it requires equal effort from both sides.

I have worked with people who say they feel weak and unlovable because they have a mental illness and when I ask them if they view others with a mental illness in that way and they usually say \"of course not, they just need help\". \n\nMaybe in the future, if you run into a similar issue, mention that there is something your husband will not disclose but that you feel is important to discuss in couples therapy and maybe the therapist can organise a way to help your husband disclose this himself, that way he may become more comfortable sharing other things in the future. Being honest about mental illness is a difficult process. \n\nHowever, if something is going on that may put your husband or others at risk of harm, do tell the therapist, that is a different situation. \n\nMeanwhile, please reach out to support groups for family/loved ones of people with depression, you should not deal with this alone and remember to look after yourself first and foremost, I hope things get better OP.", "I didn't intend it as a legal term.

Because those people don't realize that actually it's the opposite - THEY'RE the problem, THEY'RE the constant in all these situations.
