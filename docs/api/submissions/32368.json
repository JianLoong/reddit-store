Everything was going good at the church and it was time for the reception. For a little background we are a Mexican ranchero family, the wedding was formal attire. As I arrived to the reception I noticed my family wasn\u2019t getting let in. I know that the reception was by invitation only and I had their invitation in hand so I assumed that was the problem. As I was waiting to be let in I was informed that my family wasn\u2019t allowed in because of their attire. My uncles were wearing very expensive boots, black pant slacks, and a nice button up shirt. For context the bride had sent a group message to all family saying what attire was not allowed and my family followed the guideline. It said no hats/sombreros, jeans, sandals, and T-shirts. So I was confused when they told me that they weren\u2019t allowed in due to them wearing boots. I told them that we were never informed that they weren\u2019t allowed boots. To my surprise there was another groupchat with my immediate family not included stating that boots were not allowed. The bride then said we can go to Walmart to get some cheap dress shoes instead. Now I wasn\u2019t too mad about that until I noticed that there was already people inside the venue who had boots on and hats which were against the attire but they weren\u2019t told anything. And when I mentioned this the groom acted like he couldn\u2019t see them even though they were right in-front of them. So instead of causing conflict we decided to leave, when I went to go say my goodbyes all of a sudden the bride said that it was okay and we could stay. At that point it was embarrassing not being let into the venue and we declined and left. \nLater we were told that family was asking where we went and the brides family had told everyone that we went to the store and would be right back. I also want to point out that the invitation system was wack. One of the bridesmaid didn\u2019t have an invitation because the bride forgot to give it to her. And even though she was wearing the same dress as the other brides maid and all the bridesmaid were saying that she was included they wouldn\u2019t let her in. So am I the asshole for leaving with my family and not staying to finish the bridesmaid duties?", "created_utc": 1701742863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18b19ve/aita_for_leaving_my_cousins_wedding_even_though_i/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
