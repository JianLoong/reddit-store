It's like the tiniest speck of dust can trigger a sneezing fit. Sometimes the fits get so bad that I end up having a head cold for 2-3 days. \n\nMy mom(43F) used to work as a nurse. I have asked her if they'd take me to an allergist a few times and she said no. (She's the one who decides medical related stuff in the family). She says that allergy medications have severe side effects but I've had enough with this thing. Sometimes my nose gets so stuffy that I can't literally sleep(and I'm a heavy sleeper). So I told her that I'll go to the government hospital(cheaper) tomorrow after college(the hospital is near my college). She hasn't said anything and I can feel that she doesn't approve. So am I the AH if I went to an allergist?\n\nEdit: she knows how bad my allergies are. She doesn't make me clean around the house anymore(it took a lot of sneezing fits for her to realise)\n\nI also asked her a few times if I could go by myself. The answer was still no\n\nEdit 2: fit got so bad one nostril is clogged and almost peed my pants.

If you are clearly having issues, I don't know why she wouldn't want you to seek help.  Any medication can have side effects, but unless you are actually taking those medications, you will not know how they effect you.  If they help you, it is obviously worth it.", "NTA - You're 18, you can see a doctor without anyone's permission. \n\nAllergies can come on at different points in your life.

You get to make your own medical decisions and if you feel the need to go to an allergist, by all means, go to an allergist.\n\nThe only exception to this is if you're in a country with bad health care financing (like the US) your health insurance situation might cause your parents to get a large bill for this. You should still go but your parents might become reasonably upset by this.", "NTA - it\u2019s your health.", "NTA. You are an adult and should be in charge of your own medical decisions. \n\nHowever: Allergy testing can be very expensive, so you might want to look into that before booking an appointment (especially if you expect your parents to pay for it. At age 18, the bills will be sent to you and you may end up burdening yourself with debt just to find out that you're allergic to dust, which you seem to already suspect. Your parents would not be obligated to pay those bills, even if you're still on their insurance.). It's also very possible that your allergies can be controlled by taking an over-the-counter allergy medication. You are old enough to make that decision for yourself.", "NTA\n\n1) Why do you need her permission? You're an adult...

I also have allergies but for me is cough is it's so bad sometimes and just last week I went for the first time to a specific doctor and in less than a week I feel do much better and I can finally sleep and breath much better in day to day... This is to say that, you are doing the right thing to seek the right medical care for your allergy, it will be the best for you in the long run.\nYou are not a minor anymore so you don't need your parents permission to go to the doctor.\nYou are the one feeling and suffering with that allergy and it all can be better if you get the proper medication or treatment.

If you feel you need to see someone - you should go.", "NTA. It isn't fun to be stuck with allergies but finding out specifically what you're allergic to will be key to managing them. And there are many medications to relieve symptoms. Side effects are minimal. \n\nYour mother is the AH here for denying you the health care you need. Good news is that you're 18 and legally in most places, you're very much an adult and can make your own decisions.", "NTA, you need to see a doctor. Either way, you are legally an adult, your mother has no say in your medical treatment nor can she have access to your medical information without your permission.", "And over the counter allergy meds are so much better than they used to be. They have ones that don't make you drowsy anymore. The newer ones have a LOT fewer side effects than the older ones because allergy science has advancd a lot in the past 40 years, even faster in the last 10 years. Zyrtec, Clairitin, Allegra and Zyzal are all common now and the side effects are minimal. \n\nAllergies CAN turn deadly, so you DEFINITELY should see a doctor. It isn't JUST food allergies that can kill you, I get anaphylaxis from pollen in the spring so I need to carry an epi-pen all the time. I've had to use it many times, before that I would end up in the emergency room quite frequently, just because pollen is everywhere in spring and breathing isn't optional.", "You are 18 you don\u2019t need her permission any longer. \n\nEven if you are on your parents insurance, you can make your own Dr appointments", "NTA. Hun, you are 18, a legal adult now. You don't have to ask your mother to do anything anymore unless you feel like you need to. But her permission is not needed. If you feel you need to go, then go.
