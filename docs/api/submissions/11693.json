But when it happens it's harder to have compassion with a jerk than with your average classmate.", "NTA empathy is a feeling you have, not something you need to have.

Its life and we all are human.", "Nta. Karmas a bitch.", "NTA buddy sounds like an AH", "NTA, you don't owe him anything, especially if he hasn't apologised to you for what he did.

Turn about is in fact NOT fair play. Two wrongs don't make a right, and so on. But I wouldn't say you were the only AH. I'll go with an ESH as it seems your heart might actually be in the right place. I'm in no way justifying bullying, but vengeance does not help anything and can only give you a moment's joy.", "Eeeeh, going against the grain and saying YTA. He was a shitty kid, but you're a shitty adult. It's been ten years,  people grow and change and (should) learn empathy and compassion. You've decided at 28 to own a 12 year old that only exists in your memories. You don't have to go over and fix his life or personally console him, but you can keep your mouth shut and choose to not be petty, hurtful and rude because he was an asshole 16 years ago.", "Laughing at people who haven't done well later i life never happens at our finest moment, does it? It is, however, very hard not to have at least a smirk on your face, when it happens to someone who made your life hell when you were a child. As long as you don't do it again, NTA.

Depends how far you take it but jokes/commentary at a reunion that I think are pretty mild?  I don't think so.  Its obvious people are going to talk about each other at a reunion.  People are going to talk about my bald head and my fat gut, and its reasonable that its going to be negative.

Anything to justify your behavior, huh?"]}
