I\u2019m sorry, that sounds so traumatic for him. If you haven\u2019t done this already I would look into counseling for him. He\u2019s probably got a lot of big feelings he needs help identifying.

It takes two (most times) for him to feel so much like you may get back together to tell your kids about it. \n\nHow the situation should have been handled was you speak to you ex about this first, even if it took days or weeks to get ahold of him.
