And, if you ignore her decisions, she'll give you the cold shoulder for weeks.  \nUsually, it's whatever, everyone has a thing they're a little crazy about. However, for halloween its a different story compared to other holidays.  \nWhen putting together a costume that match the theme, she gets final say in what everyone wears-and again, I wouldn't really have an issue with this... except, she only approves of 'high quality' costumes.  \nHigh quality meaning costumes that typically cost more than what you would find at the store-- think $55\\~$85, which to me is a large amount for a costume that I will only wear once and only for a few hours.  \nUsually, I don't follow this rule and I'll find something that matches the theme for a cheaper price, and then accept my sister's ire and snide comments the following weeks after.  \nI don't mind, she gets out her annoyance toward me for not following the dress code and I save on some money.  \nThat being said, today my sister was out shopping and texted me to see if I would like her to buy me a $5 accessory to go with my halloween costume this year.  \nI told her no, but thanks for the offer. To which she replied saying she had already bought it and that I can pay her back whenever.  \nNow I'm a stubborn SOAB, so when I saw she had gotten it after I said no, I told her I would not pay her the $5 and she should return it.  \nShe was not happy with that, and said she's not even sure if she could return it now. And that I should just pay her for my accessory because it was only $5.  \nI told her that I don't have an accessory, she does. I don't want it and she bought it, therefore it's hers and if she doesn't want it, she should return it.  \nShe didn't reply after that, but now my mom and younger sister are calling me an A-hole for not just taking the accessory because it's only $5.  \nBut it's not about the money for me, it's about the fact that I said no, and then she went over my head and bought the accessory anyway because she thought if she got it I would just have to take it since she purchased the item, despite me explicitly telling her no.  \nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1696053894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vz50r/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_sister_back_5_for_a/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
