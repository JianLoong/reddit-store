I kept reassuring him that he wasn't failing, babies are just hard work, that he was doing an amazing job etc... Eventually I stopped asking him \"do you want to feed/change/hold baby?\" Because he just kept declining. I started telling him \"it's your turn to feed\" and just handing baby over to him.\n\nThe second day we were home he asked me if I'd be comfortable sitting downstairs on my own with baby while he went off and did his own thing in another room. I said sure, he's as entitled to his free time as I am! But since then there hasn't been a single day where he hasn't either left the house for 6+ hours a day (he's on paternity leave so not leaving for work), or has done his own thing in a different part of the house while I'm on my own.\n\nI'm doing 90% of the parenting as he's often either not in the house or he's so far away he doesn't hear her cry. At night he doesn't wake up to her crying or when she needs a feed, her Moses basket is on my side of the bed so I pretty much do the entire night alone while he sleeps. The lack of sleep has made my chronic pain hard to manage on top of everything else.\n\nI understand that he seems to have some anxieties about being a new dad, but it's barely been 3 weeks and I'm already feeling burnt out and resentful towards him, especially as he keeps saying he feels guilty for doing so little then does nothing to change...\n\nSo...

He needs to step up and pull his weight. No one said being a parent was easy.\n\nAlso, how was he during your pregnancy?", "Wait ... he's taken paternity leave which is available so men can help their wives, who've just given birth,  and spend time with their newborns ... and is using it to leave you on your own while he plays?\n\nHe is a major asshole and I would be asking him not to come back at all if he doesn't realize he's being completely pathetic and unsupportive here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Telling his to step up.  This is his child afterall.", "NTA you need to rest too and he is a parent on the same terms as you are", "NTA. Here\u2019s a trick that really works. Don\u2019t ask so much and just leave him with the baby. They\u2019ll bond. If there\u2019s nobody else to take care of the baby, he\u2019ll step in. And he\u2019ll discover he can do it. And by being able to do it he\u2019ll feel confident and love it.", "NTA at all and do not marry him if nothing changes", "NTA. He 100% needs to step it up. New things are always challenging. But there is a difference between struggling with something new and weaponized incomptence. Your husband sounds like the second and marinara flags everywhere for leaving every day to do what exactly? You need to have some serious conversations.", "tell him hes the AH please keep me updated", "NTA he absolutely needs to step up and you need to do something now before it becomes normal for him to act like this. 6+ hours a day in the first few weeks of babies life is not really ok. As a new Dad I didn't do anything for myself for a couple of months when we had sort of settled into some kind of routine. \n\nThat said post partum depression is something men can get too and it's likely he may need to address that. Often it doesn't get better on its own and can take years if left", "NTA You need to talk to him. Tell him how you are feeling. Explain to him, that it is your first child too, you are both learning.\nHe has barely helped you. He needs to step up immediately. He is only allowed to go out for that long, if you get the same privileges", "NTA you are a hero for being so nice to him so far.  \n\nPaternaty leave is so that he can support you.  does he know what your body has been through? \n\nIs he so overwhelmed by this that he only NOW realizes its not a puppy or a bunny rabbit?  Babies are more than a fully time job .  If he isn't using this as an opportunity to support you then it is wasted.\n\nWhen he goes back to work full time he will be even more useless but now with an excuse that he is 'tired' from his job.  chances are he will leave earlier and return later, being sure the carve out hi's ME TIME.\n\nHe must learn that ME time is only available after the baby and his partner are fully squared away", "YWNBTA No one wants to effectively be  a single parent and he clearly needs to step up. You probably need to communicate constructively and exactly what he needs to do rather than just saying he needs to step up.", "NTA. She's his baby as much as shevs yours! I understand that being a parent for the first time is difficult, but ignoring you an the baby is no good. Make him understand that you can't do it alone any ore and that he must take responsability of your baby!", "NTA, but honey, you need to stop enabling his escapist behavior immediately.   If he gets 6 hours nonparenting, YOU get 6 hours nonparenting, starting NOW.", "NTA, you\u2019ve been very kind thus far. But you do need to nip this in the bud before the situation and resentment becomes untenable. He does need to step up.\n\nSit down and have a conversation with him. Tell him that, yeah, you get that he\u2019s having a hard time being a parent but he isn\u2019t the only person in the world, let alone your house, who feels that way and the baby isn\u2019t going to take care of itself.", "Update - I spoke to him. I told him that I'm in no way calling him a bad father or having a go at him, but I feel like he's continuing to live his life as normal, going out for hours at a time and enjoying his free time away from the baby everyday, while I'm doing pretty much everything.\n\nHe disagreed with this aggressively saying that he'd only gone to the gym for a couple of hours and been to a few other places but it wasn't as it he was going to the bar or out with friends. I agreed that might be the case but he was still getting some alone time that I wasn't.\n\nI told him if it was a case of anxiety or something then I'd be happy to support him and do whatever I could but I need him to support me more in the day. His only response was \"Ok\" and he's since only spoken to the baby and not me... \n\nHopefully we'll sort it out in the morning", "NTA you really need to tell him now. He will just keep putting it off if you do not. It's hard being 1st time parents for both.", "If you are doing \u201c90% of the parenting\u201d then yeah he needs to step up! NTA", "NTA. At this point, despite living in the same house, you are already a single parent and he has minimal visiting hours.\n\nyou want your entire parenting relationship to be this way, or do you want a relationship with a man who is an active father/parent?\n\nIf him never doing better seems like the likely outcome of you staying silent and just wishing and hoping he will do better, then maybe consider letting him know he either steps up, or you - and baby - are stepping out.  Like I said, you are already living like a single parent, anyway.", "NTA. Tell him as long as he is on Paternity leave, he needs to do most of the daytime parenting, since you are the one getting up at night. Every day hand him the child BEFORE he walks away in the AM, and get in the car, go do 2 hours in the library and/ or meet a friend for lunch. And then take a nap in the afternoon with your door locked, him and the baby out of the room.", "NAH, you need to talk it out.", "NTA- but, he might not the AH either. If both of you are home each of you is going to handle things differently. You might be proactive, he might just not be fighting you taking the lead.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being in different parts of the house with a new baby. This can give one of you some productive time while the other tends to the baby. You just have to make sure you switch out regularly. You'll also find there are plenty of things you can do together even with a new baby; but be prepared to accept that at first if you are both present he will probably be more comfortable with you taking the lead on childcare. \n\nSome advice- go out yourself for an hour or two. It gives you a break and gives him some alone time with the baby. Your method of handing him his daughter is spot-on. Do that when you need a break. And set a schedule for each of you to sleep- the sleep deprivation is the worst. Take turn sleeping in the room with her- the other one can crash in a spare bedroom, the couch, whatever. \n\nIt does get better. Hang in there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You've been letting him act like this... NTA but you will be if you let this keep going on", "I\u2019d say neither of you are the AH, your getting worn out and he is probably nervous as hell. Being a new parent is hard and in some ways I think (biased as I\u2019m a dad) being a new Dad can be particularly scary because we don\u2019t often like to admit we are struggling or are scared. We just had baby #3 and I\u2019m still nervous at times. The trick is practice and patience for both of you. Then trying to find compromise between the two of you. For instance we split the nights, I take the baby from 10ish until about 1:30 then put him in his crib on my wife\u2019s side of the bed, she handles from then until 7 or so when I get up. We handle the days together often splitting time away. Our goal isn\u2019t always split everything with the baby 50/50 but the work in total 50/50.", "Not putting a judgment. Just a bit of advice.\n\nBeing new parents is not easy. Even parents of two or more kids still can have a hard time. \n\nStart slow and small with your fianc\u00e9. Have him hold the baby while you have do something like a restroom break.", "Wish I could upvote this more.\n\nParenting, like all skills, is a learning process. No one is born an amazing parent, we all go through doubt throughout our kids life. Please listen to 2006bruin on this, do NOT let him make this the \"new normal\"\n\nDo NOT let him think this acceptable to you OR your child.\n\nCrap like this becomes a habit if allowed to persist, which makes it \ud83d\udcaf times harder to fix/combat. \n\nYou need rest too. You need \"me\" time too. You need a break too. Remind him of this, you guys are a TEAM now, set the stage for future success and make these boundaries now.\n\nEdit: Autocorrect is the bane of my existence", "He was great during my pregnancy, and aside from the baby he's a great fiance/person to live with, we both split the housework 50/50 and he's not the kind of person I have to tell what to do. (As in I don't have to ask him to do dishes or wash clothes, he just gets on with whatever needs doing)", "Yeah take paternity leave and goof off.", "I asked him to call his doctors last week as I suspect he's suffering with post partum depression. He told me that men can't get it (I told him the absolutely can) and that nothing was wrong, he's perfectly fine, then that was the end of the conversation, he wouldn't even acknowledge me after that if I tried to bring it up again.", "Oh my god he\u2019s not a child. It\u2019s time he actually act as a father. Holding the baby while she goes to the bathroom, unbelievable  lol", "He could be having some insecurities and personal struggles going on. Maybe sit down with him and ask him about it. Let him know that you noticed that he's been acting differently and that you're worried about him and you would just like to know if there is something bothering him and if he would like to talk about it.
