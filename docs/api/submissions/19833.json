Each unit has a rooftop patio, and the only thing that separates our patios are wooden fences.\n\nYesterday, we had some workmen in the house. They must have not closed the door to the roof properly because at 10:30PM last night my partner finds the door wide open. It was raining and our cat was gone.\n\nWe searched everywhere, both inside and outside, calling her name in hopes she would come. I had to check the bushes all up and down the base of our units for her body - which luckily I didn\u2019t find.\n\nI decide to ring the doorbells of my neighbours to see if she walked the narrow ledge to one of their patios. I checked to see if the lights were on, then rang the doorbell of my neighbour to the right. They were the nicest people - should mention that we have never really spoken to any of our neighbours in 2 years of living here - and they brought me up to their patio to look for her. Even leant me a headlamp to help me see better in the rain. \n\nWhen that failed, I went to my neighbour on the left. I could see lights on through the window, so I rang the doorbell.\n\nOur doors are all frosted glass, with a small frame of transparent glass around the edges. A man comes to the door, but doesn\u2019t open it. He just stares at me through the sliver of glass. I yell at him through the door that my cat is missing, and would he be willing to check his patio for her. I think I see him nod, and he leaves. I wait (in the rain) and he eventually returns. He opens the door a sliver and tells me there was no cat. Then, he says \u201cI have kids\u201d. I\u2019m not really sure what to do with this information at this point, so I apologize and tell him that I wouldn\u2019t have bothered him if it weren\u2019t an emergency. Then I go back to looking.\n\nWe did find her eventually and I went to bed that night at 11:30PM. We found her, dried her off, I had a tall glass of water to calm my nerves, got ready for bed, scrolled some tik tok, and went to sleep. I hope that gives some indication of the time that we found her, because I wasn\u2019t looking at my watch.\n\nSo this morning I hear my doorbell ring multiple times. I rush downstairs - because no one has ever rung my doorbell that much, usually it\u2019s one and done. It was the neighbour\u2019s wife. \n\nWhen I opened the door she yells at me for ringing her doorbell \"at midnight\" and waking up her 4 year old. I don\u2019t handle confrontation well. My therapist says that I choose the secret third option from \u201cfight or flight\u201d which is apparently \u201cfreeze\u201d.\n\nSo, I told her my cat was missing and went to shut the door. She then tried to physically stop me from closing the door. I manage to get the door shut, and am hurriedly locking it when I hear her yell that she would call the cops on me if I ever did it again. At this point I am already running back up the stairs two at a time, and the only thing I can think to yell back as I\u2019m retreating is \u201cyou\u2019re a bitch!\u201d\n\nNo idea if she heard me.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1686930450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14b09rk/aita_for_waking_up_my_neighbours_4_year_old_at/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You owe them an apology.\n\nYour neighbor gave you an opportunity to apologize and you froze because of the perceived threat. Parents sometimes spend hours trying to get their kids to sleep and she was rightfully upset, however it is not right for her to be aggressive towards you.\n\nI think you should formally apologize and then explain to her that you felt threatened when she aggressively rang your doorbell.  \n\nMaybe buy them a pizza if you can.", "YTA.  This was your problem.  Waking people that late is rude.  Clearly you did not exhaust your resources before taking this step.  \n\nIf they had your cat wouldn\u2019t they knock on your door to return it?   If not, you have bigger issues with your neighbor.  I think a swift apology accompanied by lots of goodies in a basket would be in order.  You can try to make \u201cfriends\u201d of your neighbors.  If you don\u2019t do this, you should expect further discord.", "YTA, don\u2019t ring other peoples doorbells late at night.  It\u2019s hard to get kids back to sleep.

A missing cat does not warrant you to go knocking on people's doors at 11 pm! Use common sense.", "ESH.  That was too late to be bothering people, kids or no kids, for non-emergencies.

Your neighbours sound like assholes but so are you for ringing their doorbell at 11pm. For a cat.", "I totally see your side of this. I have an indoor cat who I love with all my heart. If she got out and went missing, I would lose my mind. I'd be out looking, regardless of weather, I'd be asking everyone on the street if they've seen a cat. I'd probably trample through some gardens to look in bushes, calling her name not giving a Damn who I was disturbing.\n\nBut at the same time, I would be so angry with myself. I was careless and she got out because of me. Because I didn't prepare or pay attention. In your case, I think you should of moved your cat to another room and settled them in there. \n\nI'm going with ESH. You shouldn't be knocking that late/should of prevented this from happening. But the reaction the next day was way over the top.", "Gentle YTA. It\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s problem that you lost your cat. That late at night would wake up children and when the mother complained instead of just apologising you called her a bitch. That was uncalled for.", "ESH.  Sorry to say but waking people up in the middle of the night to look for a missing cat is uncool and does not constitute an emergency to anyone else but you.  Especially if you have zero prior relationship.  However, shit happens and the neighbor escalated for no reason.  Glad you found kitty and I would steer clear of these unpleasant people.", "EHS - if you had workmen and your cat isn't allowed out, then you should have secured her in a room or travel crate or something. And then you only notice so late in the evening that the door is open? Didn't you see your cat at all after the workmen left? You don't have anyone's number that you could have rather sent a message so not to disturb their households?

Ringing on my neighbour's doorbell at 10:45PM was a pretty sucky thing to do. You're right, my emergency isn't her emergency. I didn't consider that the middle of the night, but then again I don't have kids.   \n\n\nI want to clear up a couple things I've been seeing in the comments:  \n1. We could have climbed on the ledges of the roof to search everyone else's patios, but that felt way more violating than checking for lights and ringing some doorbells. And yes, we had exhausted all of our options before we resorted to bothering the neighbours.  \n2. I had no idea that they had kids. I had never seen them before.  \n3. The door was blown open by the wind and rain. I couldn't go into too much detail because of character counts, but she was around at 9PM, then we noticed her missing at 10PM. She was safely shut away with me in my office when the workmen were here midday. I didn't even know they had gone onto the roof.  \n4. When I say that I \"yelled through the door\" I don't mean aggressively. Just loud enough to be heard. When I say that she yelled at me, I do mean aggressively.  \n5. We ended up finding her on another neighbour's patio.   \n\n\nThank you for your perspectives!", "NTA. If my pet went missing I would knock on everyone\u2019s door too.

We leave lights on in case someone needs to get up in the middle of the night, it's not so neighbors can rudely wake my kids up. \n\nThen you tried to shut the door in her face without even an apology and then ran like a child and called her a bitch. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with you?", "NTA- wow she sure is.  If you were waking the kid up all the time I could understand but it was ONE time.  Why in the world would the police need to be called over a neighbor looking for their cat which the husband took care of just fine.", "NTA. Was leaning NAH at the start because I could see why they'd be annoyed at you ringing late at night and waking their kid, even though you had good reason, but holy shit, no, their reaction the next day is WAY over the line.\n\nCall the cops? For what? It's not illegal to ring someone's doorbell that's why they fucking have them. Same type of person who shoots a child through their door because he was looking for help after dark.", "NTA.\n\nBut she is.", "NTA it's not like you do this on a weekly basis or that you intentionally put an airhorn to their babies head to wake them, it was an emergency and thats where the discussion ends", "This is tough. It would have been best if you lightly knocked instead of rung the bell. But in the ment i get that isnt in the forefront of your mind. My dog is my child so i get the panic that would ensue if he was missing (he sometimes blends in with the furniture and gives me a chill in my spine when i cant locate him for a few min)\n\nThe neighbor has a right to be upset, but to yell is over the top and is not called for given the situation.", "Nta, you fucked up by not securing your cat in the first place, but it's not safe for her to be outside like that.", "ESH - your neighbor coming to you the next day was very aggressive and uncalled for. Theyre an AH for that. \n\nBut that is very late to be ringing doorbells and I completely get them not wanting to let someone they dont actually know into their house at 1130pm. \n\nAlso, what is with this sub and people not knowing their neighbors?!", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault the workers left your door open and let your cat out. You went to go looking for your cat and you asked neighbors for help. You apologized for the inconvenience and went about your way. It was a small inconvenience that didn\u2019t warrant such aggression from your neighbors. I have a kid and had a similar thing happen to me when my kid was a few months and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. My neighbors rang my doorbell telling me their dog got out and asked us to check our backyard. My baby whined from the doorbell so my husband went to the room to soothe her while I went to look for the dog. Which btw was actually in my background he was sleeping with my dog in his dog house. We laughed about it, and she grabbed her dog and she apologized for disturbing us. That\u2019s it. I did not go to her house the next day and threaten her. And my child is significantly younger than hers meaning those sleeping hours are significantly more precious \ud83d\ude05. She made a big deal out of something small and she seems like an asshole honestly.", "YTA.\n\n> as I\u2019m retreating is \u201cyou\u2019re a bitch!\u201d\n\nShe's not though. It's entirely reasonable for her to be upset and to also threaten to get the cops involved if you ever do anything like that again.\n\nI might have let you slide on ESH... had you not picked that particular response.

Sorry OP, but if you came to my door at 11:30 pm or thereabouts, waking up my entire household because your cat is gone, I'd be pissed. \n\nYou can politely write little notes and slide them under the door, with your cell #, asking people to please let you know if they see your cat. With a gentle knock to get their attention. Creating a scene at that time of the night isn't considerate, even in light of the situation you were in.\n\nAnd also, calling a woman a bitch is terrible. You say you freeze instead of flight or fight, but you have enough mental bandwidth to insult someone?? That's just childish. Even if she is blocking the doorway - it's not confrontation, it's accountability and you chose to insult someone instead of acknowledge and apologize. YTA", "NTA so over dramatic, it wasn\u2019t that late even for a 4 year old and a one off. Glad you found your cat, neighbours need to chill.", "NTA \n\nDo what you need to do in order to help find your pet.  People aren't required to help of course, but they could have at the very least taken your number, and offered to keep a look at. Especially neighbors ffs.  People are just awful.. Like their kid has never once woken you up or anything lol.. They can be bothered to answer their door once after two years.", "NTA.\n\nIn my area, the coyotes would have eaten the cat by morning. Doorbells exist to alert people at the door. OP did the only thing available at the time. It's a one time thing. Give the neighbors a gift and thank you note after disturbing them. \n\nCrazy aggressive neighbor with a 4 year old makes no sense. Kid would just fall back asleep after one ring. If its multiple rings to the same house, then OP messed up. And should apologize sincerely. Calling the cops is wildly inappropriate.", "ESH. The proper response in that situation is to sincerely apologize for waking the child and THEN shut the door in her face if she doesn\u2019t settle the fuck down.", "Wow I am so glad that my neighbors aren\u2019t like most of the people in this thread. Op I\u2019m glad you got your cat back and I\u2019m sorry people are such fucking assholes to you.", "nta", "ESH your neighbor was aggressive, but you should not go around bothering people at 1130 12 at night because you didn't keep any eye on your pets or some how even know you had a door in your house open.", "Dude. You rang the doorbell close to midnight on people you don't even know. I'd be freaked out if I were your neighbor and totally embarrassed if I were you. The other poster is correct, it's an emergency for you, not for them. I get why you did but you shouldn't have, or at least you should have knocked (calmly and with control). You need to send over baked goods or dinner with a very sincere apology.\n\nYTA", "ESH. Your neighbours sound like assholes but so are you for ringing their doorbell at 11pm.", "ESH , the neighbor shouldn't have stopped you from closing the door, but you shouldn't have rang doorbells and yelled in the middle of the night.", "ESH. Your neighbor overreacted. You're an adult. Conflict and confrontation are not bad things. They're a part of life. Conquer that fear or you will be a doormat. I used to be a doormat.

I say this as an owner of two small dogs and as someone who goes to bed at 9pm every night. It\u2019s not your neighbours problem and it was rude of you to ring their doorbell in the middle of the night. I know it was distressing to have your pet go missing but it was too late in the night to ask if they saw your cat. Also it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure that everything is closed whenever someone leaves your house.", "Nta you didn\u2019t know about her kids and you checked the lights to see if they were awake. It\u2019s fine she was upset and she was okay to tell you that she has a child and you woke them up but to get aggressive is too far", "Yes.  YTA.", "NTA. I agree with what you called her, and she was overly dramatic and blew things way out of propotion. A gentle \"hey that was too late last night\", followed by you apologising and explaining - done and dusted. Pets are family and are important.", "YTA.\n\nI think neighbor reacted badly, but i can empathize enough for her not to be an AH.\n\nSo you had people doing work at your place, more likely than not they were making noise, probably keeping the kid up, but it was during the day time, so neighbors didn't complain.\n\nBut then you go in the middle of the night, and wake up their kid, and yeah neighbor shouldn't have yelled, but you went to shut the door on her face when you could have you know...apologized.", "NTA\n\nI assume if her baby was missing her or the cops would ring you your doorbell too. \n\nGlad you found kitty safe and sound.", "You the asshole", "YTA", "Esh. You live so close to your neighbors why have you not tried to meet them? If you knew them better maybe you could\u2019ve shot over a text instead of ringing the doorbell.", "ESH, but whilst I fully appreciate your panic when your cat went missing and why you acted as you did, you DID disturb them very late at night. Her response was equally as bad\n\nWhat I would do in this case is buy her a bunch of flowers and apologise sincerely. These things happen, but you are going to remain neighbours.", "ESH\n\nYour neighbor's reaction was out of line but she's right do not go ringing people's doorbells late at night unless you know some well enough to know it won't bother them or it is to tell them that the building is on fire and they need to evacuate. I don't care how much you missed your cat or how much you were worried about her it is incredibly rude and disrespectful to your neighbors. \n\nJust because YOU didn't check the time and YOU didn't feel it was late doesn't make it okay.", "ESH.  \nBut I think you probably learned from it so I don\u2019t think you are an AH. I get how upset you must have been. It wasn\u2019t dire or life and death even though you were super upset. You didn\u2019t let your pet tiger loose. They didn\u2019t need to deal with it at that hour.", "ESH. Your neighbour is an AH for trying to stop you from shutting your own door but your cat going missing is only an emergency for you, not other people. You shouldn\u2019t be knocking on doors at that time of night unless it\u2019s a real emergency, you know, like you\u2019re dying or something", "And seeing lights on DOES NOT mean anyone is up.

The neighbors' light was on. She knew someone was awake. A knock would have been better than ringing the doorbell, yes, but for me I would consider helping someone look for their lost pet an emergency, too.

OP still felt they were staunchly in the right and the neighbor completely in the wrong. They\u2019ve since written that they understand why bothering neighbors in the middle of the night barring a real emergency is not cool, but per the actual post, OP still felt they had done nothing wrong after the neighbor yelled at them, and that\u2019s not at all accurate.

One, people at my door unexpectedly late at night freak me out. So I\u2019d be like pushed into panic. Two, to then have my kid woken up and possibly spend hours resettling them.

What preventing some suffering is worth.  Good day.", "And how about the suffering the mom of the 4-year-old went through when their kid was woken up? That doesn\u2019t matter? The fact that OP\u2019s actions negatively impacted other people doesn\u2019t matter?", "If i had a nickel for any time, a neighbor's kid woke me up in the middle of the night.  You know why I put up with the inconvenience?  Empathy.  \n\nIf my dog got out, I'm letting my neighbors know to keep an eye out, and to make sure they have my number.
