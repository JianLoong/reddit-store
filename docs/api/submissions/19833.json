Each unit has a rooftop patio, and the only thing that separates our patios are wooden fences.\n\nYesterday, we had some workmen in the house. They must have not closed the door to the roof properly because at 10:30PM last night my partner finds the door wide open. It was raining and our cat was gone.\n\nWe searched everywhere, both inside and outside, calling her name in hopes she would come. I had to check the bushes all up and down the base of our units for her body - which luckily I didn\u2019t find.\n\nI decide to ring the doorbells of my neighbours to see if she walked the narrow ledge to one of their patios. I checked to see if the lights were on, then rang the doorbell of my neighbour to the right. They were the nicest people - should mention that we have never really spoken to any of our neighbours in 2 years of living here - and they brought me up to their patio to look for her. Even leant me a headlamp to help me see better in the rain. \n\nWhen that failed, I went to my neighbour on the left. I could see lights on through the window, so I rang the doorbell.\n\nOur doors are all frosted glass, with a small frame of transparent glass around the edges. A man comes to the door, but doesn\u2019t open it. He just stares at me through the sliver of glass. I yell at him through the door that my cat is missing, and would he be willing to check his patio for her. I think I see him nod, and he leaves. I wait (in the rain) and he eventually returns. He opens the door a sliver and tells me there was no cat. Then, he says \u201cI have kids\u201d. I\u2019m not really sure what to do with this information at this point, so I apologize and tell him that I wouldn\u2019t have bothered him if it weren\u2019t an emergency. Then I go back to looking.\n\nWe did find her eventually and I went to bed that night at 11:30PM. We found her, dried her off, I had a tall glass of water to calm my nerves, got ready for bed, scrolled some tik tok, and went to sleep. I hope that gives some indication of the time that we found her, because I wasn\u2019t looking at my watch.\n\nSo this morning I hear my doorbell ring multiple times. I rush downstairs - because no one has ever rung my doorbell that much, usually it\u2019s one and done. It was the neighbour\u2019s wife. \n\nWhen I opened the door she yells at me for ringing her doorbell \"at midnight\" and waking up her 4 year old. I don\u2019t handle confrontation well. My therapist says that I choose the secret third option from \u201cfight or flight\u201d which is apparently \u201cfreeze\u201d.\n\nSo, I told her my cat was missing and went to shut the door. She then tried to physically stop me from closing the door. I manage to get the door shut, and am hurriedly locking it when I hear her yell that she would call the cops on me if I ever did it again. At this point I am already running back up the stairs two at a time, and the only thing I can think to yell back as I\u2019m retreating is \u201cyou\u2019re a bitch!\u201d\n\nNo idea if she heard me.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1686930450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14b09rk/aita_for_waking_up_my_neighbours_4_year_old_at/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your neighbor was beyond aggressive trying to prevent you from shutting the door to your own home, but it is wildly inappropriate to be ringing your neighbors\u2019 doorbells (people you don\u2019t even know, no less) at nearly midnight. Your cat missing is an emergency for you, not them.", "Yes YTA. I understand being worried about your cat but you don\u2019t knock or ring the neighbors at that time you of day unless you have a medical emergency or something of the sort that requires the police/ fire department/ paramedics.", "Yta - I get it, I've definitely been out at midnight searching for my cat before. But you don't wake other people up to do it.", "ESH,\n\nYou should have ensured you cat was in a safe location when workers came to your house.\n\nYour emergency is not an emergency from your neighbors.  You owe them an apology.\n\nYour neighbor gave you an opportunity to apologize and you froze because of the perceived threat. Parents sometimes spend hours trying to get their kids to sleep and she was rightfully upset, however it is not right for her to be aggressive towards you.\n\nI think you should formally apologize and then explain to her that you felt threatened when she aggressively rang your doorbell.  \n\nMaybe buy them a pizza if you can.", "YTA.  This was your problem.  Waking people that late is rude.  Clearly you did not exhaust your resources before taking this step.  \n\nIf they had your cat wouldn\u2019t they knock on your door to return it?   If not, you have bigger issues with your neighbor.  I think a swift apology accompanied by lots of goodies in a basket would be in order.  You can try to make \u201cfriends\u201d of your neighbors.  If you don\u2019t do this, you should expect further discord.", "YTA, don\u2019t ring other peoples doorbells late at night.  It\u2019s hard to get kids back to sleep.  You overreacted to your cat being missing, it would have meowed if it was stuck on a ledge and you could have looked for it in the morning.", "YTA. A missing cat does not warrant you to go knocking on people's doors at 11 pm! Use common sense.", "ESH.  That was too late to be bothering people, kids or no kids, for non-emergencies.  And no, \"my cat might be on your patio\" is not an emergency.  However, neighbor lady was also out of hand for her reaction.", "ESH. Your neighbours sound like assholes but so are you for ringing their doorbell at 11pm. For a cat.", "I totally see your side of this. I have an indoor cat who I love with all my heart. If she got out and went missing, I would lose my mind. I'd be out looking, regardless of weather, I'd be asking everyone on the street if they've seen a cat. I'd probably trample through some gardens to look in bushes, calling her name not giving a Damn who I was disturbing.\n\nBut at the same time, I would be so angry with myself. I was careless and she got out because of me. Because I didn't prepare or pay attention. In your case, I think you should of moved your cat to another room and settled them in there. \n\nI'm going with ESH. You shouldn't be knocking that late/should of prevented this from happening. But the reaction the next day was way over the top.", "Gentle YTA. It\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s problem that you lost your cat. That late at night would wake up children and when the mother complained instead of just apologising you called her a bitch. That was uncalled for.", "ESH.  Sorry to say but waking people up in the middle of the night to look for a missing cat is uncool and does not constitute an emergency to anyone else but you.  Especially if you have zero prior relationship.  However, shit happens and the neighbor escalated for no reason.  Glad you found kitty and I would steer clear of these unpleasant people.", "EHS - if you had workmen and your cat isn't allowed out, then you should have secured her in a room or travel crate or something. And then you only notice so late in the evening that the door is open? Didn't you see your cat at all after the workmen left? You don't have anyone's number that you could have rather sent a message so not to disturb their households? Why did you have to yell, I've never had to yell to be heard through a door?\n\nShe didn't have to be so aggressive, but if she had a bad night after you disturbed them then maybe she was cranky about that.", "OP here.  \n\n\nThanks for all of your feedback! Ringing on my neighbour's doorbell at 10:45PM was a pretty sucky thing to do. You're right, my emergency isn't her emergency. I didn't consider that the middle of the night, but then again I don't have kids.   \n\n\nI want to clear up a couple things I've been seeing in the comments:  \n1. We could have climbed on the ledges of the roof to search everyone else's patios, but that felt way more violating than checking for lights and ringing some doorbells. And yes, we had exhausted all of our options before we resorted to bothering the neighbours.  \n2. I had no idea that they had kids. I had never seen them before.  \n3. The door was blown open by the wind and rain. I couldn't go into too much detail because of character counts, but she was around at 9PM, then we noticed her missing at 10PM. She was safely shut away with me in my office when the workmen were here midday. I didn't even know they had gone onto the roof.  \n4. When I say that I \"yelled through the door\" I don't mean aggressively. Just loud enough to be heard. When I say that she yelled at me, I do mean aggressively.  \n5. We ended up finding her on another neighbour's patio.   \n\n\nThank you for your perspectives!", "NTA. If my pet went missing I would knock on everyone\u2019s door too. If my neighbor woke me or my family over this I wouldn\u2019t be an AH and go yell at them the morning after.", "YTA\n\nYou rang doorbells late at night when you could have quietly knocked or just waited until a decent hour the next day while continuing to look by yourself. We leave lights on in case someone needs to get up in the middle of the night, it's not so neighbors can rudely wake my kids up. \n\nThen you tried to shut the door in her face without even an apology and then ran like a child and called her a bitch. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with you?", "NTA- wow she sure is.  If you were waking the kid up all the time I could understand but it was ONE time.  Why in the world would the police need to be called over a neighbor looking for their cat which the husband took care of just fine.", "NTA. Was leaning NAH at the start because I could see why they'd be annoyed at you ringing late at night and waking their kid, even though you had good reason, but holy shit, no, their reaction the next day is WAY over the line.\n\nCall the cops? For what? It's not illegal to ring someone's doorbell that's why they fucking have them. Same type of person who shoots a child through their door because he was looking for help after dark.", "NTA.\n\nBut she is.", "NTA it's not like you do this on a weekly basis or that you intentionally put an airhorn to their babies head to wake them, it was an emergency and thats where the discussion ends", "This is tough. It would have been best if you lightly knocked instead of rung the bell. But in the ment i get that isnt in the forefront of your mind. My dog is my child so i get the panic that would ensue if he was missing (he sometimes blends in with the furniture and gives me a chill in my spine when i cant locate him for a few min)\n\nThe neighbor has a right to be upset, but to yell is over the top and is not called for given the situation.", "Nta, you fucked up by not securing your cat in the first place, but it's not safe for her to be outside like that.", "ESH - your neighbor coming to you the next day was very aggressive and uncalled for. Theyre an AH for that. \n\nBut that is very late to be ringing doorbells and I completely get them not wanting to let someone they dont actually know into their house at 1130pm. \n\nAlso, what is with this sub and people not knowing their neighbors?!", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault the workers left your door open and let your cat out. You went to go looking for your cat and you asked neighbors for help. You apologized for the inconvenience and went about your way. It was a small inconvenience that didn\u2019t warrant such aggression from your neighbors. I have a kid and had a similar thing happen to me when my kid was a few months and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. My neighbors rang my doorbell telling me their dog got out and asked us to check our backyard. My baby whined from the doorbell so my husband went to the room to soothe her while I went to look for the dog. Which btw was actually in my background he was sleeping with my dog in his dog house. We laughed about it, and she grabbed her dog and she apologized for disturbing us. That\u2019s it. I did not go to her house the next day and threaten her. And my child is significantly younger than hers meaning those sleeping hours are significantly more precious \ud83d\ude05. She made a big deal out of something small and she seems like an asshole honestly.", "YTA.\n\n> as I\u2019m retreating is \u201cyou\u2019re a bitch!\u201d\n\nShe's not though. It's entirely reasonable for her to be upset and to also threaten to get the cops involved if you ever do anything like that again.\n\nI might have let you slide on ESH... had you not picked that particular response. What you did was inappropriate.", "NTW she\u2019s being completely in reasonable you should start ringing the door bell late at night and hiding after.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
