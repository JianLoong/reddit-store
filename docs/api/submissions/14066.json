He continued to say this for years because my son wanted one and he would always say \"Sorry buddy but I don't want a dog here\". \n\nWell, my mom (who treats dogs better than her own kids and is part of my trauma surrounding them) had 8 Corgi mixed puppies. She knew my son wanted a dog and asked if we wanted one for free. I said no, so did my fianc\u00e9. However, 3 days later he went to pick up my son from my mom's and showed up with one of the puppies. I was absolutely livid and it definitely caused fights between him and I AND between me and my mother. I told him to bring the dog back and he refused. He said we had to give it a chance for my son's sake. I felt like I had no say in this and I honestly shut down completely. Became depressed, hated being home because now my home smelt like constant dog shit/piss/wet dog. I couldn't deal with the whining or the barking. My trauma is so severe that even watching my son and fianc\u00e9 interact with this dog \"triggered\" me, causing me to shut down further. I tried, desperately, to bond this dog. I pushed my limits daily. I forced myself to play with her. I forced myself to be a part of the training. All it did was make me want to leave my fianc\u00e9 and let him keep the dog.

The only person who wants her is my fianc\u00e9. Final straw was her going after an old man the other day and got his hand, completely unwarranted (she's showed signs of being reactive in the past). I told him this was the final straw and she needs to go. He reluctantly agreed. Then two days later he finds out his grandmother is sick, starts crying nonstop and says he needs to register the dog as an ESA. I honestly lost it completely. I told him that he is now pulling at any string possible to keep an aggressive  animal and I'm done. He says I'm an AH because instead of comforting him I'm just finding ways to attack what is comforting him and says I obviously don't care about him.

That said, OP is NTA.", "google is a simple tool. ESA do grant people more access to housing, because they can't be denied as just a \"pet.\" they certainly aren't service animals, but they do have extra rights.", "Actually an ESA pet can sometimes be accepted as a service animal, as this status has not been tested in a UK court yet. Shops accept it and will allow access etc. \nOnce it's challenged in court then it may be that ESA won't be accepted as pet required for a disability,  but until that time someone sues for disability discrimination for not allowing the ESA access, then it's not right to categorically say its not a service animal. Case law will ultimately decide this in the UK.", "Sorry I just realised from the spelling of Mom this is a USA issue ! Not UK !", "Then those employees are poorly trained because they can kick an ESA out for any reason and a service dog can be booted for not being house trained.\n\n\"Q25. When can service animals be excluded?  \nA. The ADA does not require covered entities to modify policies, practices, or procedures if it would \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the nature of the goods, services, programs, or activities provided to the public.  Nor does it overrule legitimate safety requirements.  If admitting service animals would fundamentally alter the nature of a service or program, service animals may be prohibited.  In addition, if a particular service animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it, **or if it is not housebroken, that animal may be excluded**.\"\n\n[https://archive.ada.gov/regs2010/service\\_animal\\_qa.html#:\\~:text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20about%20Service%20Animals%20and%20the,OF%20SERVICE%20ANIMALS%20Q25.%20...%206%20MISCELLANEOUS%20Q31](https://archive.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html#:~:text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20about%20Service%20Animals%20and%20the,OF%20SERVICE%20ANIMALS%20Q25.%20...%206%20MISCELLANEOUS%20Q31) (yes this is an archived link, but it is easier to quote from than the new layout).", "HUD is a bit vague, you are right.  And it doesn\u2019t even say ESA exactly, IIRC. I have a service dog, too, so this is a soapbox for me.", "An ESA and a service dog are two different things. An ESA is not task trained and does not have public access rights.  They are just an animal that can comfort and support a person with a mental health disability, that\u2019s pretty much the only requirement.", "I know that.  You missed the part of the comment that the person I was replying to that triggered my reply:\n\n>And a puppy biting is totally normal and would in no way prevent it from being a **service dog**.", "You\u2019re right I did miss that. However a puppy biting would not necessarily wash it out of training to be a service dog either.", "Which is why I mentioned a puppy biting and it *can't* be trained out of them:\n\n>If that dog got rejected for being too friendly **a puppy who is quick to bite and you can't train it out of them** would also be rejected.", "Tried to bond with the dog.  I doubt that.  You hated the dog from the start.   When you \u201cforced\u201d yourself to play with the dog, she could tell you weren\u2019t sincere.   Let your fianc\u00e9 keep the dog for his grandmother but not at your place.", "YTA trauma surrounding corgis..... come on you could drop kick it even as a 5 year old. Acting like its terrorizing the neighbourhood. It's a tiny puppy, get it trained or give it to a family who can actually love it. Something really wrong with someone afraid of a puppy", "NTA. Your mother and fianc\u00e9 both fucked up and tbh I would call off this engagement since he clearly doesn't care about your mental well being at all.", "NTA. Emotional support animals definitely have legitimate benefits, but so many people severely abuse the privilege, and a dog who has bitten an innocent person is obviously not prepared to be one. Regardless, fiance sucks for bringing home an animal that the two of you agreed neither of you wanted in the first place without discussing it with you.", "NTA. Tell him that he and the dog have to go.", "NTA\n\nINFO: Do these people (the ones calling you an asshole) even know the full story? Because I would stress the fact that your house smells like pee, that she\u2019s reactive? If you stress that more, they might be more understanding. Also, how old is the dog at this point? It takes a lot of patience to train a puppy especially depending on how young it is.", "It\u2019s a doctors note.", "OP isn't trying to punish the puppy. She didn't want to live with it due to her self-proclaimed irrational hatred of dogs. She has deep trauma from this and never wanted a dog, which her fiance knew and accepted as reality. Now all of a sudden OP is being forced to live with a puppy completely against her will.", "Yeah, I think the FHA technically calls both ESAs and SDs 'assistance animals' or some such. And I think the whole ESA in public thing is a soapbox for a lot of us who have service dogs, seeing how much money and time are invested in ours, how valuable their work is to us, and how easily all of it can go out the window if one of those 'non-service service dogs' attacks. Had to retire my previous dog because of that exact issue, so I'm right there with you on the soapbox!", "I couldn\u2019t find anything in FHA about animals at all only generic \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d.  HUD mentions animals as accommodations.  I\u2019m not sure if my searches were accurate, but I just couldn\u2019t find anything."]}
