This morning I woke up with a venmo request from my roommate (21f) for an uber. I texted her confused on why she tried to charge me when I hadn\u2019t taken an uber last night and she said that since they were forced to take an uber because I backed out of my promise to drive them, they all agreed I should pay my half of the uber. I argued that I was under no obligation to drive them and they could have ended the night early with me or waited for someone else to sober up. She said that I didn\u2019t have to offer to drive in the first place if I wasn\u2019t actually going to go, so I should pay.

Or would somebody have drank less so they could drive to the party?\n\nBecause it sounds like the only thing that changed is that on the way back to get more drinks at your place you offered to drive but if you hadn\u2019t or you had decided to drink more you all would\u2019ve Uber.\n\nIt actually sounds like their argument is that if you had stayed awake you would\u2019ve paid for some of the Uber. And because you decided not to go they had to pay for 100% of the Uber. They were actually hoping to not have to pay for any Uber, putting aside that they probably don\u2019t donate gas money to you.\n\nThe only argument they could have is if there were long-standing plans or somebody changed what they did based on what you offered. But it really just sounds like in that moment they were hoping not to have an Uber and then they were disappointing they did. And why is it half? Weren\u2019t there several people?\n\nAlso she is the only one that Venmoed you, is she the one that paid for the Uber and everyone gave their share to her?\n\nYou are NTA but if this is uncomfortable I would verify the amount of the Uber by asking to look at the trip and make sure cost is *divided by the correct number of people* and then I would send her that amount of money\u2026\n\nAnd tell her you understand she was disappointed although they would\u2019ve had to take an Uber anyway if you hadn\u2019t offered - and it\u2019s not like all of the night\u2019s plans were built on this offer. \n\nAnd in the future you will not offer to drive anyone because honestly it\u2019s a hassle for you, no one gives you any gas money or helps with the wear and tear or expenses for your car, and you were just trying to do something nice and you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be so tired. \n\n\u201cI understand people were disappointed, but I don\u2019t really think they were put out given they were going to take an Uber anyway.

If she hasn\u2019t said that, then presumably another one of them could have abstained from drinking at home so they they could drive, but she removed that option for them by functionally giving them to okay to all continue drinking at home.\n\nRegardless, I think people take not following through with what they said they\u2019d too far too lightly. It\u2019s always an AH move to back out on something you said you\u2019d do a short time before and that had a direct impact on others.", "\u2026 a white claw is 1.3 standard drinks. she fell asleep because she was tired.", "Not necessarily. Depends on the person.", "That doesn't really matter, it's still illegal to drive with a BAC under the limit but more than zero.", "> That doesn't really matter, it's still illegal to drive with a BAC under the limit but more than zero.\n\nThen what exactly do you think \u201cthe limit\u201d is for?", "That's not true lol", "It is possible to be too drunk to drive even if your BAC is under the legal limit. It\u2019s just that if your BAC is at or over the legal limit, by definition, by law, you are too drunk to drive.\n\nThe only comparison I can think of is rape. Obviously, if you have sex with someone without their consent, that\u2019s rape. But there is a legal age under which, it doesn\u2019t matter if the person appears to offer consent. The law says they are too young to consent to sex, so by statute, that is also rape. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called \u201cstatutory rape.\u201c\n\nThere are people, like me, who can have one drink and not be capable of driving safely.
