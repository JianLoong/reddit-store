We fought about this for months (I didn't want to get it done against her will), her reason for wanting another was that she always wanted a bigger family. My reason against was that I felt that she had a hard time keeping up with daily tasks with only 2 kids, I also spoke to her at length about how another child would be financially unsustainable since I have 2 jobs and am barely making ends meet (not to mention that I too am exhausted all the time).\n\nAnyway, before we could reach a conclusion she fell pregnant (she was on the pill and according to her, barely ever missed a day). We now have a total of four beautiful children that I love, but I can not bring myself to giving her the extra help for the twins. We now are stressed and fight all the time. I sometimes want to help her with the twins but it gets me so discouraged to see everything I warned her against come to pass. I know they are my children too, but it is not fair to get yourself in a situation when everyone is advising you against it.. then ask for help when the shit hits the fan. Now when I come home from work, I help just as much as I used to with our first 2 children, nothing more nothing less. AITA for refusing to help my wife with the twins?\n\nTLDR: wife didn't want me to get a vasectomy and now she had twins that she needs constant help with.\n\n**EDIT**:\n\n\nThanks for your replies, you guys held no punches and tore me a new asshole in the process. \n\nJokes aside, to address the recurring concerns. \n\n- We live in a small house and meal prep for a couple of days at a time, so cleaning and cooking shouldn't take long. My eldest is in school during the day and my 4 year old actually helps with the twins. My wife is tired all the time not due to the work load but because she spends all day on her phone even going to bed past 3am daily because she \"lost track of time\". On my days off I used to take over so that she can rest, it takes me a little over an hour to do everything and I manage to put the kids to bed by 730pm. I feel that I am feeding into her bad habit (phone) by being so hands on. \n\n-I understand that the pill is not 100% but she does not enjoy sex with condoms which is why we use BC. Marriage is about trust.\n\n- As for abstinence anyone that lives with their SO will tell you that it's easier said than done. \n\n- I do take care of all my children (homework, playing, feeding, bathing etc.), when I say I refuse to give her the extra help I mean I do not go above and beyond or take over after work as much as I used to. Especially since I told her prior to having the twins that I am already limited in what I can do due to my work hours.\n\n- I agree, therapy would help get over the resentment I feel, but I do not have the time or money for that right now.", "created_utc": 1693582080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167a8kx/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_so_with_our_twins/", "score": 4732, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I\u2019m going to tell you that this is going to make or break your marriage, but with the attitude you have it\u2019s going to break it. You say you love your kids, but you already seem resentful of them otherwise you would have no problem helping them with their bath/homework/ feeding. Ya I get it is hard, while my husband only had one job he was gone 12 hours a day and he would help me with the baths and take the night shift with the baby every night.

So based on this post, I think your wife is an incredibly selfish person. \n\nHowever, you now have 2 more kids and unfortunately you\u2019re just going to have to suck that up and be a proper dad. Think of the kids. \n\nIf you weren\u2019t happy with her pushing you, you should\u2019ve left earlier.\n\nYour wife is selfish and disrespectful, and you\u2019re holding too much of a grudge and not considering your children.\n\nInterestingly some people are still saying YTA and not taking into consideration your wife\u2019s actions.

You are JUST as responsible for the twins as she is, she may have carried them but they are still all your children.", "YTA. It takes two to make a baby. You could have had the vasectomy whether she liked it or not. You could have refused to sleep with her if you didn't trust her to take the pill reliably. It's always difficult when a couple disagrees on how many children to have as there isn't really a way to compromise, but you could have dug your heals in as your reasons for stopping at two were good.", "I think you both need to have marriage therapy. She feels neglected you feel trapped and you both have a right to feel that way. What you need is to find a way forward through counselling or to separate and co parent.

It\u2019s just an excuse to be lazy.", "YTA - If you were absolutely against having more children, then it was your responsibility to use a condom, not rely on your wife's pill. In addition, you should've suggested couples counseling to discuss your desire for the vasectomy and your wife's opposition to it.

You, because it takes two to tango, and while you had both agreed on using the pill as contraception, even if she was taking it absolutely perfectly every single day (and let me tell you not one woman on this planet does this), it\u2019s still not 100% effective, so the onus, if you were dead set against kids, is also on you. If that means that there\u2019s no sex without a condom, that means no sex. Those children are still your children, and your responsibility. They didn\u2019t ask to be born. \nYour wife, because she seems to have thought she has control over your body by not allowing you to have a vasectomy, potentially messing with her BC and making sure you had more kids.

You should have both been in agreement and since you didn't want to have more you should have either abstained or used condoms, forgive me if you did, I know fully well everyone can do what they need to and still pregnancies can happen, but the way you phrase it, sounds like the birth control was only on her end, so until you resolved the argument you should have either abstained or have extra protection and worry about her actually taking the pill every day.\n\nHowever, the deed is done, you now have FOUR children, is not about \"helping her\", is about being a father, that's not \"helping\" that's raising. Those kids didn't ask to come into this world yet here they are and they deserve your love and involvement, not because of your wife although she did just carry two humans to term, but because of them, what, are you always going to be a little away and a little resentful of them for the rest of their lives so they'll notice their brother and sister have more love and attention from you and involvement from you than they get? You already have four children, neither of them asked to be here, so you owe it TO THEM, to dedicate time and love and attention to all of them not just pick and choose because you're angry at your wife.\n\nETA: I just read a comment that \"she didn't want condoms and I can only hope she takes the pill every day\", yeah no, I'm changing my vote to Y T A because nobody forced you to do the horizontal mambo lol.

This is on you and regardless you have a responsibility to those children. They\u2019re yours.

Step up and care for the kids you helped create.", "If your wife was refusing to practice adequate birth control (barely ever missing a pill means she was missing pills, this makes then ineffective) and not letting you use options (condoms or a vasectomy), then you should have stopped having penetrative sex. \n\nHand jobs exist. Using toys exist. BJs exist. Cunnilingus exists. There are ways to get off that would have prevented this.\n\nOr you could have put your foot down and said no condom/vasectomy, no sex.\n\nYou didn't. You kept having sex. \n\nIt takes two to embryo, my friend.

You could have easily done any of these things.  I have my ribs tied, and I'm still extra careful so as not to have even more children.

Helping with them means having a relationship with them. They basically don't know you right now. It does sound like you have a lot of problems in your relationship and a lack of boundaries.

You chose to have sex with someone who sometimes forgets? to take the pill. If you didn't want kids you should have either not had sex or used extra protection. If you do not take your pool every day at the same time like a robot it becomes a lot less effective quickly. Like drastically. When I was on the pill as a teenager I made sure to take it every day at the same time. That sucked and required quite some forward planning, especially during summer, but I did it. You know why? Because I didn't want to get pregnant. You don't barely miss any days if you don't want to get pregnant, you simply don't miss any days at all.", "How can she \"refuse condoms\"?  You guys NEED to find a therapist NOW before baby #5 is on the way.  Tell her you're getting a vasectomy -- you're beyond the asking stage.

Therefore, at that point you should have stopped having sex with her.\n\nSo I still think the YTA verdict for not caring for your children. If you were forced into sex though, then that would be different.", "You get a vasectomy if you wanted one. She wanted more children and made that decision independently.", "Lol didn't know she could physically stop them from being in your penis, no glove no love have you not heard of that phrase?
