We're in debt and spending this much will ruin us...\"\n\n>W: \"What!? You know this vacation has been a dream of mine! You can't just cancel it!\"\n\n>H: \"I'm sorry, but if we spend that money, we'll be homeless.\"\n\n>W: \"We'll talk about this later!\"\n\n>A week later.\n\n>W: \"Honey, I just bought the tickets and paid for the hotels for our vacation.\"\n\n>H: \"What!?\"\n\n>H goes to reddit and asks if he's the asshole for getting upset about this situation.\n\n>You: \"Well, he didn't cancel his credit cards so this is on him.\"\n\nThis whole analogy makes zero sense. LOL.", "Those are not the same at all. No one saying that he shouldn't be mad at her but at the end of the day there his kids and he should be looking after his kids regardless.", "Except a holiday isn't a pair of living,  breathing human beings. The kids need to come first! Getting all petulant about being right isn't a good look for anyone. A father saying that about his babies? The older kids will have picked up his animosity towards the two babies, it will have affected them already, if not the babies too. Those poor kids. I feel sorry for them. Not the adult who thought that sex without contraception apart from birth control pills with someone who wants more kids wouldn't lead to more kids. It takes two to make a baby (or twins in this case). He should have got the vasectomy - his body his choice (I say that as a wife who was on the fence about her husband getting one before he got one.)", "And the thing is, we, nor OP knows if this was on purpose or an accident. So, this still falls back to if he didn't want another kid he should have abstained or put many restrictions in place, like condom only. It's very common knowledge that the pill can fail.", "But get ready bc this shit about to get heavy, \n\nI just settled all my lawsuits. FUCK YOU DEBBIE!!", "1 in 5 is still very high numbers for pregnancy. \nGood job you can't get pregnant via your mouth", "Exactly. She was clear she\u2019s not perfect at her birth control and he was adamant about not having kids. He just assumed she was responsible for deciding to get pregnant or not so he didn\u2019t take his own birth control into his own hands. You never leave it up to someone else. Ever.\n\nEdit: and then when a kid does come around you don\u2019t just decide you aren\u2019t responsible for the child. Or claim your partner coerced you when it\u2019s not provable given the circumstances to get out of parental responsibility. If he didn\u2019t want to be the father he could have relinquished his parental rights (which given he\u2019s married and these are his kids then I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s possible)", "Yea, honestly I\u2019d always feel like there\u2019s would be a nagging suspicion that getting pregnant was intentional", "Just to note in this case it's clearly OP's choice, not a requirement from his doctor.  In my case: snipped a little less than 20 years ago and although my wife was very much in favor, her opinion or consent never came up with my personal physician nor the surgical office that did the procedure.", "My point is, she may very well have stopped taking the pill entirely, and just lied to OP about it. People lie constantly. And women are people, too. And she was already adamant about wanting to get pregnant again, hence the arguments between her and OP before she got pregnant.\n \nTo me, that would be the same as a guy removing a condom mid-coitus. If one is rape, both are.", "i\u2019m sure she\u2019s killing herself too, with all the household  responsibilities AND the children. \nI agree, she sucks, cuz she shouldn\u2019t have pushed having another baby. HOWEVER he didn\u2019t decide to stop having sex with her unless she wore a condom, or definitively decided on a vasectomy. He CHOSE to continue having sex with her and cumming inside her, despite knowing it might lead to a kid. Cuz sex might lead to a kid, and if it does, you have to take responsibility for your actions", "It's literally almost a direct analog... Not really my problem if you can't make the connections.", "And now I will this will be on repeat in my head for 2 days", "He called her SO and not spouse so they may not be married. In any case, always be warry of any protection you are using especially when one person is adamant on being pregnant. And make sure not to put your genitalia in!", "Except OP knew that she wasn't even being consistent about her birth control and as an adult who's capable of understanding that inconsistent birth control is equivalent to no birth control even if she was lying about taking it at all he was playing a risky game and won the prize (prizes, in this case) accordingly. He was lying to himself and is now trying to push all of the responsibility onto his wife because he wanted to get his dick wet.", "You\u2019re right. But that\u2019s a technicality in this case. \n\nNever relinquish responsibility for your own fertility people! Ever! Ever! Ever!", "He knew what? She told him she almost never missed a day. From what I understand, that's a pretty good rate for a woman if true. \n \nI'm not arguing that he had no responsibility. I'm pointing out that some people seem to be giving her more leeway than seems appropriate to me. On its face, it certainly seems like **she actively lied** to get the pregnancy she wanted, and people are just glossing over that fact because he has a penis.", "Missing even one day makes the birth control less effective.\n\nThat\u2019s literally why they make you go to the doctor to ask them about it and they walk us through the risks, side effects and what happens if we\u2019re not consistent.", "Your understanding of how birth control works is incorrect. That doesn't magically make your assumption that she actively lied correct. OP knew she wanted more kids and didn't want to use the effective methods available to ensure there wouldn't be and still CHOSE to have sex with her. They both suck equally.", "And purposefully not taking them makes them completely useless.", "She told him after she was pregnant", "I fully agree with your last sentence. But my assumption that she lied is just as valid as everyone else's assumption that she didn't, and all I've been trying to do is point that out to people.", "fr i would never ever ever rely on just the pill. you gotta take that at the same time every day for it to work! and when he knows that she sometimes misses a day (hardly ever=sometimes=this is not effective birth control this is just regulating her period) agreeing to have sex without any other protection is fully agreeing to unprotected sex. now, would i keep a kid if the other party does not want it? hell no. is it fucked up that she kept the pregnancy? hell yes. but he could have said \u201ci\u2019m not having unprotected sex with you\u201d he could have said \u201ci\u2019m getting a vasectomy and i don\u2019t need your permission\u201d he could have said \u201cif you do not terminate this pregnancy i will leave you\u201d. punishing her now? after the kids are born? that\u2019s just messed up. \u201cshe\u201d does not have twins, both of them do. he is not \u201chelping\u201d with two of his children, he is barely parenting half his kids and neglecting the other half. and he claims to love them. if you love your kids, why are you punishing them? if you hate your wife, why don\u2019t you get a divorce? on what planet is *this* the reasonable thing to do? for this situation? yta. on a larger scale esh and i am glad i don\u2019t know any of these people."]}
