We met in pre-k and were inseparable for most of our lives. Literally a sister I always wanted. I ultimately cut ties with her. I could tell by the time we were in middle school and had gone to different schools we were drifting apart. Our interests changed and she began associating herself with people completely opposite to her or so I thought. Our senior year of high school she invited me to go on a forced \u201cdouble date\u201d with her bf at the time M (19) and his brother M (20). We were both 17 at the time and she didn\u2019t tell me his age. I agreed after her constant begging and went despite my uneasy feeling. Her bf picked us up from my house and as soon as we got in the car they all began smoking. Mind you she knows I don\u2019t smoke weed and the smell alone triggers my migraines. I rolled down my window and didn\u2019t speak to her the entire car ride ignoring her trying to make me smoke and \u201clet loose\u201d. We went bowling and the entire time my \u201cdate\u201d had his hands on me every chance he got and kept making nasty comments about my ass and body every time I stood up. I got up and left without saying anything and ubered home ignoring all her calls. I answered her the next day and she told me I was prude and it wouldn\u2019t hurt to sleep with him because he\u2019s a nice guy and she knows him. I told her she was an AH and I was uncomfortable and as my bsf she should\u2019ve known that. That night I told her I wanted to distance myself from her for awhile and she said she was just stringing me along bc she felt obligated and she\u2019s happy it\u2019s over.\n  During covid she apologized half assed and we have since been civil with each other. I now have a beautiful group of friends from college who support me and she has tried to regain my friendship but I told her I don\u2019t feel that will ever happen but we can talk from time to time. She doesn\u2019t have any close friendships and only has her bf because she has always prioritized him (another reason I cut ties) She updates me on her life here and there and vice versa. \nRecently she got engaged and I congratulated them and wished them well. She invited me and I said ofc Id attend (as a guest). She began hinting at me being her MOH and that she has no sisters or close friends and I\u2019m \u201cher last hope\u201d. I said I don\u2019t want that responsibility and she can do without or have her mother be it. She said I was being unreasonable and could set aside our differences for this one time. She also brought up how we have always dreamed of this since we were babies and can set aside petty drama for her big day. I said no because the bond we once had is long gone and it wouldn\u2019t feel right. Her bf texted me the other day saying I\u2019m being a bitch to his gf and I should really set my priorities straight. I said she\u2019s been a bitch to me more than once and she\u2019ll live.

She doesn\u2019t care about y\u2019all\u2019s friendship, she cares about how it\u2019ll look for her to not have a friend that is excited to be her MOH. Not your issue, and you were respectful when you turned the offer down both times. Though you shouldn\u2019t have needed to, she was obviously just trying to guilt you into changing your mind after the first \u2018no\u2019.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do. They can\u2019t force you to be her MOH. You have good reasons for not wanting to do it, and even if you didn\u2019t, who cares? They can\u2019t force you. I would simply tell them both that if they keep it up, you won\u2019t even be attending as a guest. Actually, no, I wouldn\u2019t even go because her boyfriend called you a bitch. Why would you want to support her marriage to someone who insults you and resorts to petty name calling? If he was really concerned, I would think he would be extra nice trying to convince you to be her MOH, not insult and call you names. I would just send her a final message and wish her well and tell her it\u2019s the last time the two of you will be speaking, then I would block both of them on your phone and social media. You don\u2019t need toxic people like that in your life. You removed yourself from it once, I think you should remove yourself from it again.", "NTA\n\nShe is a friend from your past.  You both have moved on with your lives.\n\nWish her well and tell her you cannot be in her wedding party or her maid of honor.  Don't let her guilt you into it, \"since we used to be so close.\"\n\nGood Luck", "NTA. No means no. It's not an obligation.", "NTA.\n\nI can't believe this needs to be said in 2023, but \"No.\" is a complete sentence. Plain and simple. Even if you and your ex-BFF didn't have a falling out and were still BFFs, you have no obligation to be her MOH if you don't desire that kind of responsibility. Even more so now, you don't have that obligation as you've split apart more as her desires, personality, and interests changed as you both aged. I can understand BFFs gaining different interests as they age. However, under no circumstances should those new interests lead others down potentially illegal matters.", "NTA\n\nThis person has treated you and spoken to you like garbage. She tried to make you smoke weed. She forced you on a double date with a guy who sexually harassed you the whole night, then called you a prude for not sleeping with him. Her apologies were half-assed. It seems clear to me that she only wants you around when it conveniences her, and she always manages to make things uncomfortable for you.\n\nHonestly, it says a lot about you (in a good way), that you said you'd go to the wedding at all, despite all of this. However, if I were you, I'd block off all contact with her and her boyfriend/fianc\u00e9. They seem like totally toxic individuals, and you said you have an amazing friend group now. You don't need these two dragging you down when you have this friend circle lifting you up.", "NTA\n\nYeah calling you a bitch is an *excellent* way to convince someone to take the time and trouble of being an MOH /end sarcasm.\n\nI love that you have found your folks. The people who support you and who you support. I am generally unsympathetic to the 'but she has no friends' argument when made by adults. When grown people have no friends, there's usually an excellent reason. And a problem where the fix is completely out of anyone's hands to fix but their own. \n\nPlease do not get pulled into her toxic vortex again.", "NTA. I wouldn't attend her wedding after that. Unreasonable, entitled and d*** people.", "Huge NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t even go.  She\u2019s never shown any remorse or accountability for how she\u2019s treated you and just expects you to sweep it under the rug.", "NTA You've been clear that you are not a good friend and you don't feel comfortable taking on the role of MOH. Berating you and nagging you isn't going to win you over. It just cements the fact that you've made the correct choice.", "NTA - She tried to drug you so you would sleep with her bf's brother. RED F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* FLAG. Why are you still in contact with her.", "NTA\n\nI think OP\u2019s priorities are right on target.", "You don\u2019t seem to like each other very much. It\u2019s okay to not force socialization with someone when you\u2019re an adult just because you went to the same school as children. That\u2019s one of the perks of growing up. \n\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever going to grow up.\n\n\nNTA and time to move on.", "Run far far away. I would absolutely cut ties and contact with her after this stunt. I wouldn't go to the wedding either, just to stay on the safe side. After her gem of a husband-to-be sent you that text, neither of them deserve a follow up or response. \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated.\n\nYour friend was a shitty friend, but i wouldn\u2019t be so quick to throw the whole relationship away. As of now, distance is healthy, but she may grow up, and there may come a time when you wish you had kept her in your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
