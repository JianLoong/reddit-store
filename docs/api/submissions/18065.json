I just know that rainy days always come up so I save for those days. My boyfriend (25) is currently unemployed - and has been for the past year.\n\nNote: We live outside the US.\n\nTwo weeks ago, he asked me to loan him $1000 and said that he was selling his gaming consoles, so when he gets money from that, he\u2019ll give me back my $1000.\n\nI said okay and loaned it to him. On three different occasions he said he would give the money back to me.\n\nFast forward to last night. He sold his consoles for over 5k yesterday and told me that he was carrying me out on a date as a reward for assisting him when he needed it most.\n\nHe took me to a fancy Italian restaurant a few blocks down from my house. It\u2019s my favourite restaurant and I frequent there a lot. We get there and we order. I had shrimp pasta and two mocktails. He ordered a steak, extra sides of fries, and a couple alcoholic drinks. \n\nAnyway, the bill came up to $1200.\n\nHe paid the bill. \n\nOn our way home, he held my hand, looked me in the eyes, and thanked me for an amazing night out and an amazing meal.\n\nI said, \u201cI should be thanking you, you\u2019re the one who took ME out\u201d and I laughed. He looked confused. He said, \u201cTechnically, you took US out, since you paid.\u201d\n\nIf I wasn\u2019t confused before, I was definitely confused now. I asked him what he meant and he said \u201cwith the $1000.\u201d\n\nI just looked at him in confusion. He said that he thought that instead of giving me back the $1000, he would use that money to take us on a date - and that he contributed as well as he put the extra $200.\n\nI pointed out that he didn\u2019t even tip the waiter,  I never told him to use that money on a date for us, and if I knew I was essentially going to be paying for it, I wouldn\u2019t have come.\n\nHe said that I was an AH for being ungrateful and for not appreciating the time and effort it took him to plan this date.\n\nI told him that all he did was use my money without my permission when he should have just given it back to me like he promised - and \u201crewarded\u201d me with his own money. \n\nI also pointed out that I have taken him on lots of dates with my own money, so using my money in this way behind my back was shady. He got visibly upset and looked like he wanted to cry. \n\nI just walked away and got home on my own. \n\nI messaged him when I got home to let him know that I\u2019m home safely and he said he needs some space away from me because he can\u2019t trust me with financial issues - and he can\u2019t trust me to not walk off when things get rough. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m wrong.", "created_utc": 1684936177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qma6l/aita_for_walking_off_on_my_boyfriend_after_an/", "score": 819, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Calling you ungrateful, the almost crying, the \"I need space.\" It's all a bluff to get you to feel guilty and apologize to him... for not being happy that he didn't return the loan as agreed and that he was purposely shady in his wording to treat HIMSELF to fancy dining ON YOUR DIME. \n\nDepending on where you live, you could take him to small claims court if you wanted because your loaning him the money was contingent on him returning it when he sold his consoles, this was agreed upon before you gave him the money, and he effectively broke that agreement. \n\nNot saying it'd be worth the trouble, necessarily, but to put it in perspective. He scammed you. Don't let that slide.", "NTA - I would take him to small claims court.

He never paid you back, so how can he claim that was your money he spent?\n\nThis is gaslighting 101. Saying HE can't trust YOU with financial issues??? He played a trick on you, dear. He can't be trusted. You did nothing wrong, yet he's upset? This is all very manipulative. \n\nI'd take this \"space away\" to think long and hard about what a future with this man would look like (hint: he thinks your money belongs to him).

He doesn't get to decide how you spend that money.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is gaslighting you. What kind of boyfriend rewards his partner for her being there when he needed her most by making her pay for an extravagant dinner without her fucking knowledge beforehand? He tried to get out of repaying you your money (while also getting a luxury dinner) by tricking you and when you saw through it he flipped it back on you to make you feel bad. You did absolutely nothing wrong and your boyfriend has got to go.", "NTA. Good God, I\u2019m speechless.\nLet just see things straight: he is unemployed; he asked you to LEND him some money; he got the money back; he asks you out on a date and says he\u2019s going to pay; after the date he thanks you and says casually that he paid with YOUR MONEY.\n\nOP, just think calmly about the situation and I think you will be able to see the mind game he played with you. That was so abusive.\n\nPlease don\u2019t think for a moment that this was your fault. He\u2019s trying to control you.\n\nHe\u2019s such an AH\u2026 like one of the hugest I\u2019ve ever heard of on Reddit.", "NTA.  He's gas lighting you.  He still owes you the $1k.  Also, why is he not in a job?  It's been a year.  If he has crippling medical health issues fair enough but if not then he's gas lighting you here too because presumably you're paying for food and keeping a roof over your heads?  Are you ok with being his meal ticket if that's the case?", "NTA you lent him cash and he paid you back by taking to dinner. It sounds like he got more out of the dinner and the relationship. He is deflecting by saying he can\u2019t trust you with money issues. He is the untrustworthy one. You walked away because he was not listening to you and you needed to remove yourself from the conversation and cool down. He should have been mature enough to recognize he is in the wrong, reflect and apologize. Placing blame on you is a huge red flag and honestly reminds me of DARVO tactics used by abusers. \n\nYou may want to rethink what this guy brings to the relationship.", "He\u2019s financially using you, he\u2019s emotionally immature.

I think him taking space is a good thing for you", "NTA. Wow, he\u2019s not even trying to be sneaky about it. He\u2019s just openly stealing your money and attempting to gaslight you to get away with it.

Get rid, NTA.", "NTA, you might want to keep walking away from this one. Doing that with your money is very wrong, and how he acted after you found out is another warning sign.

You agreed he would pay you back when he sold his stuff, he hasn't done that.", "NTA.  Demand the $1000 back in cash immediately, THEN he can take a few days to think about things.

I would break up with him. \n\nHe should never have planned such an expensive date until he had a job.

Please", "NTA. It\u2019s him. There are so many red flags. Taking you out on a $1200 date when he is unemployed is concerning. Even more concerning that he thought it was okay for the $1000 to come from the money he still owes you. He needs to get his priorities straight. I\u2019m not one to tell people to break up with their significant other, but I really hope you do get rid of him. Is he even trying to find a job instead of trying to make quick money by selling his stuff? I would not trust him at all. I feel like I\u2019ve seen this story over and over and it never ends pretty. I hope you get your money and run. Even if you never get it back because judging by what I know so far, he\u2019s not trustworthy, but a $1000 loss is better than being stuck with someone so irresponsible and manipulative. You seem financially responsible but people like that will try to milk you for what you are worth. I can\u2019t imagine what can be redeeming about this person so it sounds like you\u2019re much better off without him.", "NTA. He owes you $1,000. Then he can get all the time away from you that he wants.", "NTA\u2026and here we go again:  good $ earning women ( not the easiest to find) dating a broke as$ loser.  When will the ridiculousness end?", "NTA. You expected to be paid back, that\u2019s normal. On top of it he\u2019s trying to guilt you. Cut your loses and get rid of the bf too.", "NTA - you have done nothing wrong in this situation, your boyfriend is the AH here. Personally I would break up with him, he seems to have no moral sense of right or wrong. But that\u2019s your call. Also, HE \u2018needs some space\u2019 away from YOU?!

In reality, sound relationships are a 100-100 effort/investment. Outside of a good time your Bf is contributing 0 and it\u2019s been this way for a year. \n\nI don\u2019t understand his reasoning at all, but it\u2019s shady. Then gaslighting you after the fact. How much \u201ctime and effort\u201d could it have taken him to plan a date a few blocks from where you live at a restaurant you frequent and he knows is your favorite?\n\nClearly don\u2019t lend him money ever again.

At all.", "\"he said he needs space away from me because he can't trust me with financial issues\"\n\nthis is gaslighting and he's the ah.

Get your $1000 and leave before it gets worse.", "NTA... This is not how loaning someone money works. He 100% should have paid you back, and not assumed you would accept a like-kind exchange instead.
