He immediately messaged my friend asking why he made the decision to tell me this in this manner, and my friend stated he feels the optics of hanging out 1 on 1 with another woman would not look good. I feel hurt and confused, especially since I would never ever dream of standing in between someone\u2019s marriage. I responded and said this would be ok and that I respect his boundaries, which I do. But I\u2019m realizing that I also command a level of respect from my friendships, and this feels like he doesn\u2019t trust me after all this time. I can\u2019t get over the fact that \u201coptics\u201d would be placed above a lifelong friendship. His fianc\u00e9e is super kind and wonderful, and I have really enjoyed getting to know her.

Am I in the wrong for feeling blindsided, for wanting to explicitly ask what tf our friendship is going to look like now???

This exact thing happened to me in my 20s with someone I considered one of my best friends.  I absolutely broke my heart at the time.

I can't hang out with you anymore remember?", "YTA.\n\nIf you can not respect his ask of you you really are not that close of a friend. \n\n\nIt is like you think only what you want matters.

Maybe his GF is secretly jealous of you?\n\nI'm leaning towards NTA though.  You don't need a reason to end a friendship if you don't want one.  You don't need to justify that to anyone but yourself.", "Idk I feel like there\u2019s missing info your not telling us but honestly nah he\u2019s not asking to not see you anymore just not one on one but you also don\u2019t need a reason to end a friendship", "ESH\n\nGiven how long the two of you have been friends, he should have spoken to you face to face.

Doing it over a text message without any explanation was not cool.\n\nOn the other hand it is totally normal for couples to set a boundary around hanging out with members of the opposite sex in one-on-one situations. You are right it is kind of antiquated. But it's not abnormal or all that unreasonable.\n\nYou might be going to a bit of an extreme by ending the friendship entirely. If you really do like his fiance and really do want to continue being his friend, just relax and lean away from that one friendship for a little while. Like you said, you have a lot of guy friends.\n\nHow's your friend and his fiance get more comfortable in their relationship and she gets to know you better, it's quite possible that you and your friend could go back to hanging out one-on-one at some point in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I thought I was good friends with both of them before this happened. I threw them a going away party when they moved out of state, planned a fun gas money fundraiser for them.   At the time I was in a serious relationship. My long time boyfriend and I broke up AFTER they moved thousands of miles away and that's when I was told no more hangs. I was suddenly a threat.  Thanks for making a hard time worse, my childhood best friend. Even if it was all her idea, he didn't stick up for me.  He agreed with her.  I'll never ever forget that even if I can forgive him enough to see him at friend group reunions and hang out. All desire to be buds with him has disappeared.

Not your problem either way but I'll say this very thing that he did to you is not indicative that his relationship with her is healthy. You have no idea what they talk about in private.

In other words, wait for him to reach out to you.

You can leave the friendship if that's what you want to do, and that doesn't make you TA.  But asking about his fianc\u00e9s involvement in his decision making is too far. Relationships change.

Personally, it just seems ridiculous; I didn't expect it of my ex (who had several close female friends through work that would confide in him) and he didn't expect it of me. \nI have a friend from university and spending occasional time with him has, I understood after, caused a bit of an issue with various girlfriends - after almost 40 years of our friendship, it's inconceivable to me that his partners could feel so insecure!\nSure, all relationships change, ebb and flow, over the years but I've always felt that you either trust your partner or you don't. If you don't trust them and they never given you any reason to doubt them, what kind of way is that to live? \nDunno why your friend has done this, if it's a decision he came to on his own but, sadly, I don't think you'll ever see him in the same light. As he gets older, hopefully, he'll appreciate how important good friendships can be. NTA.", "It sucks, but it seems like we as women are usually able to see our male friends as just friends (not necessarily potential BF material) whereas in 9/10 cases (in my experience - im 30F) males see their female friends as a friend too buuuutttt with a giant question mark over their head - a potential GF, if given the opportunity, or a FWB if nothing else. So if thats the case here, he probably had an easy time moving out of the friendship once he got his GF/fiance. You might have been a \"backup GF\" your whole friendship which explains his feeling like he needs to separate out of \"respect\" for his fiance. Absolutely not your fault. Sorry this happened to you.", "I get how much it sucks to discover your friendship with this guy has been more important to you than to him. It's normal to grieve the friendship you thought you had.\n\nAs someone who is edging in on 40, and has gained and lost friendships along the way, I can tell you that this guy really did you a huge favor.  He was totally honest with you about the fact that optics are more important to him than your friendship.\n\nTime to demote his importance in your life.", "I, a female  have a male close friend who would like to stay over night when visiting, since it would be more practical.\n\nI live in a very small town, the kind where it is interesting whether you had coffee or tea this morning and If they don't know, there will be a few insisting and spreading that I started my day with vodka.\n\nI really don't need people telling each other I slept with him, so off home he goes in the evening...\n\nHas zero to do with him- it is all about the optics. I am also quite sure that if he had a gf she wouldn't be comfortable with him stayimg overnight by himself. \nIf he had and If he loved her, he wouldn't skirt her boundaries as close as he could- he wouldn't want to cause her distress  so he would give a wide berth around her boundaries to show her respect.\n\nThis  I think you can understand. Appreciate this guy. It is NOT about you.", "You could at least try this new dynamic. If he is a great friend then his  partner may be great as well, this could be an opportunity to add another close friend in your life. I\u2019m sure if you and she become friends the boundaries will shake out to a place where you all feel comfortable.\n\nYou are certainly within your right to bail but it seems silly to throw a friendship away entirely without even trying. You said you live hours away so it\u2019s not like you see each other in person much anyway. \n\nIf you throw in the towel without trying, you may find you regret it later in life.", "I will say that I don\u2019t think this is coming from a fear of cheating perspective. From reading these comments and talking with others, this decision has much more nuance. I don\u2019t want to be equally reductive in assuming it\u2019s all coming down to cheating for him.", "Okay but what is the reason why that can't hang out? Because he thinks they'll have sex or something? \n\nIt's crazy to \"create a boundary\" when the solution is for him not to cheat. \n\nIt also shows that he thinks she might try to sleep with him? Which is also kinda gross", "That\u2019s fair. And definitely, relationships change a lot. I think it\u2019s only natural and positive for change to happen, being stuck in the past doesn\u2019t leave room for us to grow as people", "It isn\u2019t a boundary, it\u2019s being controlling. A boundary is something personal and is centered around how others treat you. For example- please don\u2019t use language like that with me when we have disagreements. \n\nWhen you dictate how someone else interacts with third parties, that\u2019s control. For example, you can\u2019t hang out for your friends one-on-one", "I have to disagree, it's about trust. He isn't doing this to all of his friends, only OP. I find that super weird. If you trust your partner you don't mind hanging out with people they could be attracted to. If you trust yourself you don't mind hanging out with people you could find attractive.\n\nI'd be pretty pissed too if I was OP. She isn't her genitals. She is a whole person, this \"friend\" can take it or leave it, it's not OK to expect her to accept being a friend whenever it's convenient for him.", "How many of his male friends do you think got this message because he has his whole mind and focus on his wife now", "It could be his insecurities and this is a boundary he requested of his partner and is just making it fair. We don\u2019t don\u2019t know and neither does OP. \n\nOP lives hours away so this barely changes anything, the guy could have not mentioned anything and just only made non 1 on 1 plans. He was honest and didn\u2019t just ghost her.\n\nOP can think the worst and bail or try it and see how things go.", "If the two partners together decided that they would not spend 1 on 1 time with the opposite gender, then it is a boundary for their relationship. Every relationship has boundaries; I don\u2019t mind if my partner goes to a strip club occasionally but for some people that is a hard line. If the two partners are in agreement then it is not a control issue. We do not know anything about the dudes relationship.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "I understand this discourse on all sides\u2026 I get where you are coming from and like statistically speaking, it is correct that married people social lives look very different from the social life they had as a single 20 something. I will say that she\u2019s clearly not an abusive person, and me not knowing his fianc\u00e9e too well, I don\u2019t want to speculate about peoples lives."]}
