I messaged my other good friend about it (also a 24M, the three of us have grown up together), since I didn\u2019t know how to respond/react. He immediately messaged my friend asking why he made the decision to tell me this in this manner, and my friend stated he feels the optics of hanging out 1 on 1 with another woman would not look good. I feel hurt and confused, especially since I would never ever dream of standing in between someone\u2019s marriage. I responded and said this would be ok and that I respect his boundaries, which I do. But I\u2019m realizing that I also command a level of respect from my friendships, and this feels like he doesn\u2019t trust me after all this time. I can\u2019t get over the fact that \u201coptics\u201d would be placed above a lifelong friendship. His fianc\u00e9e is super kind and wonderful, and I have really enjoyed getting to know her. I don\u2019t really know how to feel, especially considering we made plans well before I came to town. He still lives in our hometown, but I have moved away and only get about 2-3 weeks of vacation time off from my job/year.

He\u2019s felt very distant since stating this relationship and I am trying to be mindful and respectful. I don\u2019t want to cause any amount of drama, but this whole thing feels very antiquated. I have plenty of close guy friends that I hang out with in close proximity despite the fact they are dating other people/are engaged. It\u2019s never been an issue. I\u2019m now just angry and hurt, and questioning if I even have the energy to keep up this friendship. I want to speak my mind and not let this slide past, but I\u2019m prone to overreacting about things and I\u2019m not sure how to go about this. Am I in the wrong for feeling blindsided, for wanting to explicitly ask what tf our friendship is going to look like now??? Is it an overstep to ask if he and his fianc\u00e9e made the decision together?

Your entire friendship is being redefined under a perspective of potential sexual relationship which I would find very disturbing with someone with whom I have a longstanding friendship. It also feels like small stuff that used to be normal for you two could easily turn into drama.\n\nYou are definitely not TA for taking a step away from the friendship or ending it.

Either he doesn\u2019t trust himself and feel secure in his relationship or his fianc\u00e9 is jealous and doesn\u2019t trust the friendship. \n\nEither way, you are fully valid in how you feel and if you really want some kind of answer - ask. Be direct, don\u2019t go overboard with delving into questions. Ask and be prepared for an answer you\u2019re not going to like and to say goodbye to this friendship.

Optics, indeed.", "NTA\n\nI'm a single guy (30) whose best friend is a married woman (33) and it's not weird hanging out one-on-one.

Unfortunately, sometimes people grow apart or begin to go in different directions in life, even if they've been friends a long time. Perhaps wait a bit before you talk to him, try to give yourself a little time to process so you don't say something hasty and regret it later. It might be time to just allow a bit of distance to naturally grow between you. It's awful, and it sucks, and losing a friend feels like a break-up sometimes, even if you weren't dating.

It's a complete betrayal of your friendship by him.\n\nFriendships and closeness of friendships come about organically. By erecting a sudden barrier to that I wouldn't be surprised if it just caused it to pretty much completely go out as a result.\n\nI wouldn't blame you if you wanted to get more info on why this has come about when it was never an issue before as nothing has changed (engagement doesn't magically add new relationship boundaries)", "INFO\n\nPerhaps he has objected to his fiancee hanging out with a male friend one on one and she has said in that case the same rules apply to him?

I\u2019d leave the friendship if I were you.", "NTA for wanting to leave. \n\nHowever, if you think of him as a dear friend like you say you do I would take some time to adjust to this new boundary of his and see where this leads. Will he become cold and distant when you meet in group setting then perhaps you are right to distance yourself. \n\nI just would not burn any bridges just yet while you digest and get used to this new boundary.

This exact thing happened to me in my 20s with someone I considered one of my best friends.  I absolutely broke my heart at the time. We were in a group of friend and I was the only girl so it definitely singled me. I'm so sorry. In my case it irreparably damaged the friendship. How could I look at him the same way again?  After they got divorced (bc OF COURSE they did) he reached out. I was getting married and I think he wanted to come bc others from our group were.  Sorry jerk. I can't hang out with you anymore remember?", "YTA.\n\nIf you can not respect his ask of you you really are not that close of a friend. \n\n\nIt is like you think only what you want matters. If he can't be properly available for you, you don't want him.", "It feels like there's missing info here...\n\nDid you ever have 'a thing'?  Maybe he has some secret feelings for you?  Maybe his GF is secretly jealous of you?\n\nI'm leaning towards NTA though.  You don't need a reason to end a friendship if you don't want one.  You don't need to justify that to anyone but yourself.", "Idk I feel like there\u2019s missing info your not telling us but honestly nah he\u2019s not asking to not see you anymore just not one on one but you also don\u2019t need a reason to end a friendship", "ESH\n\nGiven how long the two of you have been friends, he should have spoken to you face to face. Or at least called you voice. Doing it over a text message without any explanation was not cool.\n\nOn the other hand it is totally normal for couples to set a boundary around hanging out with members of the opposite sex in one-on-one situations. You are right it is kind of antiquated. But it's not abnormal or all that unreasonable.\n\nYou might be going to a bit of an extreme by ending the friendship entirely. If you really do like his fiance and really do want to continue being his friend, just relax and lean away from that one friendship for a little while. Like you said, you have a lot of guy friends.\n\nHow's your friend and his fiance get more comfortable in their relationship and she gets to know you better, it's quite possible that you and your friend could go back to hanging out one-on-one at some point in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They chose for this to happen. The full ramifications of what this means for you,  for your friend group, etc., is still yet to be felt. I 100% guarantee that the fiance was a part of this decision. I thought I was good friends with both of them before this happened. I threw them a going away party when they moved out of state, planned a fun gas money fundraiser for them.   At the time I was in a serious relationship. My long time boyfriend and I broke up AFTER they moved thousands of miles away and that's when I was told no more hangs. I was suddenly a threat.  Thanks for making a hard time worse, my childhood best friend. Even if it was all her idea, he didn't stick up for me.  He agreed with her.  I'll never ever forget that even if I can forgive him enough to see him at friend group reunions and hang out. All desire to be buds with him has disappeared. If he dumped me as a friend once just bc I'm a girl, he doesn't see me as a person,  only as a \"female\". That broke my heart.  About the divorce, it very well might happen. It might not. Not your problem either way but I'll say this very thing that he did to you is not indicative that his relationship with her is healthy. You have no idea what they talk about in private. But he agreed to it. Its his bed and he's going to have to lie in it. So so sorry about this. But you need know this is about him and his relationship not you so go live your best life.  You learned about what kind of person he really is and you've got the rest of your life to hang out with better people. I do and you will too. It's tough though. There is a lot of advice when someone you're dating dumps you and not so much when a friend does and in my opinion it hurts a lot worse when a close friend relationship goes sour.", "That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he never had feelings for you.", "I understand it does suck to loose a friend but he wants to have his reasons and if you don\u2019t agree with them that\u2019s understandable too", "I\u2019m sort of wondering if it\u2019s an overstep to ask if they did come to this decision together as well.

We are in our 40s. One of the first things I brought up as we were getting to know each other is that I tend to have more female friends than male friends.\n\nThat was something that we talked about as we were figuring out whether or not we were compatible and Suited to be in a long-term relationship with each other.\n\nFriends are up there on the list next to finances religion and politics that can cause significant incompatibilities between people.\n\nMy suggestion is to give your friend some space and let him take the lead on modeling what the Friendship is going to be like going forward. In other words, wait for him to reach out to you. Or if you reach out to him, do it once or twice and see how it goes.\n\nThe most important thing is to accept that the dynamic of his friendship with you has changed. The two of you can still be friends.

That sucks so bad. You are completely right in that there\u2019s soooo much advice for relationship breakups but basically none for friendship breakups. It really just hits you in the chest. It\u2019s sobering getting older and watch people make these decisions \ud83d\ude22", "Your instinct is correct. It would be overstepping your bounds to ask about how they came to the decision. That is their business in between themselves as a couple.\n\nMost people in their twenties are still figuring out who they are. It is super common for people do not want their partner hanging out in one on one situations with friends of the opposite sex.\n\nDon't take it personally though. You didn't do anything wrong. She might be a little bit insecure.", "Yeah, idk. This is not a bash on her at all, I don\u2019t really know her that well and can\u2019t comment to that", "I just reread your post. It is clear that you want some structure and clear understanding of the new boundaries for your friendship.\n\nI do not think you are going to get those in the near term. Those are going to evolve and become clear over the next few months, and even longer.\n\nI'm guessing that you don't have anyone else to confide things in like you did with your friend. That can be tough. If you find those kind of things sticking in your thoughts, you can write them down in a journal."]}
