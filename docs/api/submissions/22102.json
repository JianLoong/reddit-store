He's exhausted and offered multiple compromises-- either she goes alone or with a friend, or they can go together Monday-- while she's offering none. NTA in the slightest.", "What? Planning to relax is 100% plans. GF can also be more flexible. If I had been looking foward to doing nothing for a day all week and my partner knew that, then asked me to do something instead, sticking to my original plans is not being an ah. GF can ask a friend to do something if she needs to get outta the house so bad, and op is NOT responsible for her mental health, nor does he need to prioritize hers above his. OP is NTA. GF is manipulative!", "NTA. She doesn't seem to care about your health at all, or she wouldn't be demanding you to jump at her will to serve her instead of letting you rest.

Since you don\u2019t actually explain what your gf was going through at the moment.... I don\u2019t think anyone can judge her. Was it a reasonable request? I have no clue. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think either of you are ah. \n\nInstead of pointing fingers at each other perhaps you should have a conversation about how to better manage this type of situation in the future.\n\nIf this is an ongoing issue then maybe you\u2019re not compatible as a couple.", "She just said she was feeling low so there's nothing I can explain about what she was gonig throguh beause that's all she would say.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an ah but .... if my husband really needed me to help him get through some struggles I would probably just change my plans to the best of my ability. After 31 years of marriage I can tell you compromise is a healthy relationship tool. But if neither of you are feeling your best I can totally understand why this turned into an issue. \n\nIf she just doesn\u2019t believe you get a day to relax then that\u2019s just ridiculous. You should talk about what happened from each of your perspectives. Why was it important that it happen the exact way you wanted it to happen?

A get out of jail free card? \n\nIt's just a new way to manipulate at an old game. Yes, we have different needs and we can mention what would make us happy, but we dont demand it at the cost of the other person's wellbeing.", "NTA - She knew your plans and is asking you to sacrifice your mental health so her mental health prospers. It sounds like she's co-dependent and needs to have more hobbies of her own. She also could've waited until Monday if you were both off.\n\nI would have a serious discussion with her, because I have a feeling she will unfairly resent you for not adhering to her plans. If this is a constant thing, then I would reconsider the relationship.", "NTA and I\u2019d be looking long and hard at someone who put their needs ahead of mine when I\u2019d stated my intentions with plenty of time for them to adjust to what they needed. I tell my husband regularly-I am not leaving the house unless a fireman has me in their arms! It\u2019s necessary and you were well within your rights!", "NTA - gf has a lot of growing up to do.  \n\nShe is very dependant on this relationship.  She needs to be an individual first before considering being in a couple.  I'd be allergic to this kind of clinging", "NTA - It's okay for you to do your own things sometimes. Scheduling a day to relax is still a plan and she doesn't get to just override it because she wants to. It sounds like you communicated this early as well.

Although it may not seem like a big issue in the grand scheme of things, it is concerning that your girlfriend is completely disregarding your mental health in order to prioritise her own. I hope that this is a one time thing and doesn\u2019t crop up elsewhere.\n\nYou made her aware of your plans with more than enough notice, and offered solutions such as going out the following day, or her meeting up with a friend. You were willing to hear her out, but she wasn\u2019t with you.\n\nBoth of your needs are just as important, but you scheduled yours in first. That\u2019s all there should be to it.", "Why couldn't your gf go out for a walk herself and you stay in? Like, I'm in the exact same situation with my partner and if we both had different needs (which we often do) then we're not joined at the hip and could just do our respective things.", "NTA. Is your girlfriend one of those people that can't stand seeing someone else sitting around for 5 minutes without finding something for them to do? Sounds like less of a mental health thing and more of a I don't like seeing you being \"lazy\"", "NTA she is asking you to put her mental health before your own that is a huge red flag! There is no reason you can\u2019t have your day to relax and she can go out and have her day out.", "NTA\n\nMighty convenient that she waited till that morning to suddenly need to go out for her mental health and drag you along. \n\nYou already made plans. She knew about them. She can go out by herself.", "NTA and big red flag right here. Resorting to trying to get her way by saying \u201cbut my mental health!\u201d and ignoring your mental health is a sign of a narcissist. I know you\u2019re not asking about breaking up, but think about how she is going to try and manipulate you in the future like this again.", "NTA. It's troubling that she knew about your plans in advance and still tried to prioritize her needs over yours. It's like she did it on purpose. You two may need to work on whatever that underlying issue is to have a healthy relationship.", "NTA, this is very serious in my eyes, I'd suggest a long talk about boundaries and self-preservation and even some therapy for both of you individually. Unfortunately, if she refuses to accept that you put yourself first, you gotta make some hard decisions.", "NTA. Stay firm on your boundaries and don\u2019t let her get away when crap like that", "NTA - I\u2019m glad to see you stuck to your boundaries", "NTA- and maybe time for some reflection? Does your GF consistently try and undermine your mental health, and use hers as a way to get what she wants?", "The fact that you think you might be an asshole for wanting to practice self care is pretty alarming.  Does she regularly not acknowledge that your feelings/needs matter?", "Codependent much?", "NAH. Sometimes everyone is burnt out. And the less mental energy we have, the harder it is to spend it on others and seeing their perspective. I\u2019m sure normally you\u2019d have no issue taking her out, but on this day you didn\u2019t have it in you to do so. Just like on other days I\u2019m sure she could have understood that and left you alone or made other plans. It sounds like you both need a break and being kind to each other can be hard when you\u2019re both in that state of mind.", "I would not call either of you AHs. I would say you both need to learn to compromise more. Neither of you is wrong or right in this circumstance. If you can't learn to compromise with each other then it will be impossible to build an enduring relationship.", "You are not important.  You should realize this.  What she wants is the priority because she is the princess.  We ALL struggle with issues.   Who doesn't?", "Lol, NTA, but wait until you\u2019re married.

Why is your mental health more important than mine?  No, why is yours more important than *mine*.  Jesus Krispies what a joke.  Who cares who declared their plans hours ahead of the other.

ESH", "You both sound bratty, tbh. Why couldn't you switch your plans to Monday? What difference does it make?", "Feels like YTA. Spending time with your gf is kinda bare minimum effort. You didn't have \"plans\" you were just staying home which you could have easily done the next day. Why did it make such a big difference to you to do nothing on Sunday vs Monday?", "Was she wrong to ask you the same morning when you\u2019ve had planned beforehand? Absolutely, but it seems like you\u2019re standing firm just to make a point\u2026 I call this 49% NTA and 51% YTA.", "NTA if her mental health is prohibiting her from doing something without you there, she needs to respect your position. It sounds exhausting.", "Nta.", "NTA.

You can both have your mental health day. You can stay in, and she can go out. You don't need to do it together.\n\nThis shouldn't be a conflict but your girlfriend is making it into one.", "NTA from experience I can say burn out can really wear on you and some days you just need that rest. It isn't your job to be going out every day even if it is your girlfriend.", "NTA. You and your mental health matter too. You offered reasonable alternatives, at that point she was being capricious for wanting YOUR presence in particular. She could've gone out with her friend Sunday and you on Monday. There needs to be a compromise.", "NTA, she clearly DOES think her mental health is more important than yours, she insisted in how her own plans that would make her feel better are more important. Good for you for prioritizing your health. Hope you feel better soon.", "No nta. Why should her mental health be more important than yours", "NTA. You told her before Sunday. You explain again, but her actions show she thinks her mental health is more important than yours.", "NTA", "Nta, she can go do her things without you", "NTA.  If she wanted a day trip so badly and you weren't up for it, she should stop nagging you and make plans with a friend.  You said you were going to spend the day chilling at home, if she wanted more activity than that, then that's on her to find a solution that didn't involve you.  This has nothing to do with mental health of anyone, it's about making choices for yourself.  If her mental health issues are getting out of hand, she needs to discuss this with her therapist.\nWork was killing me too, but I had the opportunity to retire early.  Browse info about new career options while you're relaxing.  My 30 year old son got fed up with his job and is now in training to be a train conductor.  You don't have to stay in a job that's burning you out.  Look for a new job, go to trade school, look at certificate options at community college.  Some community colleges offer aptitude tests and can help guide you to a new career.", "NTA.

And she cannot go out without you? Why?", "NTA.  You offered a compromise and she said no,   and also like you said she could out with family or friends.", "NTA.  You made plans, and communicated those plans with your partner in advance.  Her deciding day-of that she also needs a day, and somehow her needs trump yours, make her an asshole.

You're right: her mental health is not more important than yours.", "NTA", "Major NTA. You expressed in advance your plans for the day. Suddenly that day arrives and she needs to be out and with you? Nope. Her decompression time absolutely does not trump yours, nor should she expect it to. \n\nThis is a bigger conversation, I think.

Op, it\u2019s time to have a sit-down with your gf and talk about reciprocal empathy and support.

Fairness is not one-sided.", "Sounds exhausting", "NTA", "NTA. Your gf is displaying a level of co-dependency on you that isn\u2019t fair nor healthy. It\u2019s not a reasonable expectation to rely on only your partner to get needs met. Ideally she should feel secure enough to go out without you. If she has difficulties with this, if you have the option to go to therapy together, I highly recommend it.", "NTA - your gf is suffering from a case of \"I can do that to you, but you can't do that to me\".", " NTA. Your mental health is just as important as hers, and you had already communicated your plans for the day in advance. Many people think that resting is simply laziness, but it is important to listen to our bodies and give them what they need when they need it. Resting when needed (not talking about days-long depression sleeping here) is a productive activity because you are actively taking care of yourself in that moment. If she was in such need of going out for the day for her own mental health, then she could have invited a friend out or just gone out solo instead.", "NTA,\n\n but I would suggest to consult for your ongoing depression/burnout", "NTA - why can\u2019t she go out and do something by herself?", "NTA at all.", "NTA.

And if she ruins it, have a relaxing Monday as well!", "NTA.\n\nYou know what we do when one person wants to go chase dopamine by going bargain hunting in supermarkets and the other one finds that activity exhausting and dopamine-draining? That's right, the dopamine chaser goes on their bargain hunt alone while the other one stays at home. That way we both get what we need. Because we're adults who can do things by ourselves now and then.", "NTA to put this in a physical analogy, its like you've each got a broken leg, she's asked you to rub her errands because her leg is broken and when you've suggested \"Could you use a delivery service or ask a friend who doesn't currently have a broken leg to run your errands?\" She's responded by complaining that you don't care that her leg is broken. It's ridiculous", "NTA. You can do things separately. It would really annoy me if my SO couldn't get up and out and do their own thing without me.", "NTA.

I often would oblige but I slowly grew resentful my needs weren\u2019t being respected or considered, despite repeatedly and politely expressing them. I also grew exhausted because I work full time and like to have one day a week (just one!) to lay low around home, it\u2019s how I like to recharge and prep for the next week. Needless to say that relationship wasn\u2019t meant to be. NTA", "NTA. Sounds like she took what you said about needing time for you, and tried to twist it into being all about her instead.
