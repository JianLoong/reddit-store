That's unreasonable. \n\nYou both recharge in different ways and she should respect that.  And you offered to do it another day, so no, you're not the asshole.", "NTA \n\nI completely get that level of burnout and needing to decompress, I need those days and tell my wife 2, 3 days in advance that I need this day to unwind. She's happy to be lazy sometimes if not she'll go see some friends or family or get her nails done whatever, you don't have to do everything together all the time.\n\nShe'll invite me or ask if I'd like to do something but there is zero expectation and more she's just seeing if I changed my mind which sometimes I do. \n\nLook after your health and well being OP and encourage your partner to do the same", "NTA\n\nYou'd made your plans to relax at home on Sunday very clear and explained that you were burnt out and needed this to improve your mental state.\n\nWhen she decided she needed to go out, you offered her the option to push it to Monday. That's a very reasonable compromise, and only a day later. \n\nShe seems to think that her desires and needs (whether related to mental health or not) trump yours and that's a bit of a worrying trait in a long term partner.", "NTA\nYou communicated your plans beforehand  and offered her a decent alternative for what she suggested.", "You made a boundary. You communicated it clearly.  A decent person would accept this without question. \n\nThe rest is just \u2018noise\u2019. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, its her bad that she can't do her mental health by herself.

You stated your needs clearly and your gf shat all over them. She doesn't care about your mental health, only her own. You gave her clear options, but it seems that she expects you to be her only option and doesn't care what it costs you.", "NTA is she always in capable of doing things alone? Does she always want to be prioritized over you? Or is this a one off? If you communicated your plans that should be enough.

She should respect that.  She could ask her friend to go out with or go on her own.  You even told her that you both will go out together on Monday.  I suspect that she's jealous and is trying to take your day away from you and wants it to be her, her, her.  \n\nYou both need to keep communicating even though you have been communicated with her often.  She needs to learn to keep communication open.", "NTA. You need to put your own health first.", "NTA. My husband works at an office, I work from home. On the weekends he exercises in the mornings and then likes to rest, eat, catch up on tv shows. I sometimes excuse myself for a few hours to get my dose of social interaction and then I join him back at home. Everybody has needs and they\u2019re not always the same, the key word here is respect. And adults don\u2019t need to be attached at the hip either.", "NTA- She could have gone out alone.", "She's trying to control you.  RED FLAG ALERT", "NTA\nIt seems like she sees your \"rest and recharge\" day as \"not doing anything\" that she can schedule for you at her whim.\nHer using \"mental health\" as her reason for \"needing\" you to sacrifice your plans for hers seems manipulative. Rather than accepting your decision and explanation, she's made it a power struggle over who controls your time.", "I agree so much with this. OP made a boundary to have his needs met. Anyone who challenges or argues against that is disrespectful of that boundary.", "I was thinking along these lines. \n\nIf this is a pattern, it could be to do with control or attention or making you prove you value her? \n\nThe one day you need for your MH and suddenly she comes in wanting you to go out with her for her MH\u2026.sounds off.", "No there's no reason. Neither of us drive so we'd have been getting the train and no shes not disabled", "What do you mean we had a different perspective? I communicated to my gf that I would be using the full day to relax and recharge as I was burnt out and then when the day came she expected me to cancel it because she wanted to go out. That isn't a different perspective, it's just expecting me to cancel my plans", "Me having a day to relax and recharge is a plan. Why is it my job to be flexible and not my partner? There is nothing she wanted to so on Sunday that could not have been done on the Monday so why is it different?", "For people that need alone time to recuperate these are definitely 'plans'. 'Going out' is not a clear plan either, no reason why it can't be done the next day like he suggested.\nHe clearly stated his plans for that day beforehand, which trumps her last minute idea to do something.", ">\"watching netflix and playing video games\" are not \"plans.\"\n\nBro his plan is to do whatever the hell he wants to do. His plan is to do the things he wants to do for himself. His plan is literally to stay home and relax, how is that not a plan?", "Seriously? He needs to be more flexible? He's exhausted and offered multiple compromises-- either she goes alone or with a friend, or they can go together Monday-- while she's offering none. NTA in the slightest.", "What? Planning to relax is 100% plans. GF can also be more flexible. If I had been looking foward to doing nothing for a day all week and my partner knew that, then asked me to do something instead, sticking to my original plans is not being an ah. GF can ask a friend to do something if she needs to get outta the house so bad, and op is NOT responsible for her mental health, nor does he need to prioritize hers above his. OP is NTA. GF is manipulative!", "NTA. She doesn't seem to care about your health at all, or she wouldn't be demanding you to jump at her will to serve her instead of letting you rest. You offered to go out with her the day after, so she can either take that offer or go out with someone else or by herself on that day. She could even go out both days!", ".... you needed to stay home & she needed to get out of the house to relax & recharge. That\u2019s just a different perspective of how to manage your needs.", "Yes but when I've already communicated what I need then my gf should accept that instead of thinking her needs come first. I suggested she go on her own or with friends but she was adamant that I cancel my plans", "That's not a different perspective, that's having different needs.", "You both thought your needs should come first .... it\u2019s possible for 2 people to be burnt out & need different things to help them cope. \n\nI\u2019m guessing you feel very strongly that you\u2019re right & she\u2019s wrong. Since you don\u2019t actually explain what your gf was going through at the moment.... I don\u2019t think anyone can judge her. Was it a reasonable request? I have no clue. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think either of you are ah. \n\nInstead of pointing fingers at each other perhaps you should have a conversation about how to better manage this type of situation in the future.\n\nIf this is an ongoing issue then maybe you\u2019re not compatible as a couple.", "She just said she was feeling low so there's nothing I can explain about what she was gonig throguh beause that's all she would say.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an ah but .... if my husband really needed me to help him get through some struggles I would probably just change my plans to the best of my ability. After 31 years of marriage I can tell you compromise is a healthy relationship tool. But if neither of you are feeling your best I can totally understand why this turned into an issue. \n\nIf she just doesn\u2019t believe you get a day to relax then that\u2019s just ridiculous. You should talk about what happened from each of your perspectives. Why was it important that it happen the exact way you wanted it to happen? Sometimes people in relationships just annoy each other.... it happens. Often. \n\nHopefully you\u2019re both feeling better"]}
