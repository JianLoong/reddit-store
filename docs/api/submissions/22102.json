Planning to relax is 100% plans. GF can also be more flexible. If I had been looking foward to doing nothing for a day all week and my partner knew that, then asked me to do something instead, sticking to my original plans is not being an ah.

GF is manipulative!", "NTA. She doesn't seem to care about your health at all, or she wouldn't be demanding you to jump at her will to serve her instead of letting you rest.

Since you don\u2019t actually explain what your gf was going through at the moment.... I don\u2019t think anyone can judge her. Was it a reasonable request? I have no clue. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think either of you are ah. \n\nInstead of pointing fingers at each other perhaps you should have a conversation about how to better manage this type of situation in the future.\n\nIf this is an ongoing issue then maybe you\u2019re not compatible as a couple.", "She just said she was feeling low so there's nothing I can explain about what she was gonig throguh beause that's all she would say.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an ah but .... if my husband really needed me to help him get through some struggles I would probably just change my plans to the best of my ability. After 31 years of marriage I can tell you compromise is a healthy relationship tool. But if neither of you are feeling your best I can totally understand why this turned into an issue. \n\nIf she just doesn\u2019t believe you get a day to relax then that\u2019s just ridiculous.

Is it like a book of tokens? A get out of jail free card? \n\nIt's just a new way to manipulate at an old game. Yes, we have different needs and we can mention what would make us happy, but we dont demand it at the cost of the other person's wellbeing.", "NTA - She knew your plans and is asking you to sacrifice your mental health so her mental health prospers. It sounds like she's co-dependent and needs to have more hobbies of her own.

If this is a constant thing, then I would reconsider the relationship.", "NTA and I\u2019d be looking long and hard at someone who put their needs ahead of mine when I\u2019d stated my intentions with plenty of time for them to adjust to what they needed.

It\u2019s necessary and you were well within your rights!", "NTA - gf has a lot of growing up to do.  \n\nShe is very dependant on this relationship.  She needs to be an individual first before considering being in a couple.  I'd be allergic to this kind of clinging", "NTA - It's okay for you to do your own things sometimes. Scheduling a day to relax is still a plan and she doesn't get to just override it because she wants to. It sounds like you communicated this early as well.

Although it may not seem like a big issue in the grand scheme of things, it is concerning that your girlfriend is completely disregarding your mental health in order to prioritise her own. I hope that this is a one time thing and doesn\u2019t crop up elsewhere.\n\nYou made her aware of your plans with more than enough notice, and offered solutions such as going out the following day, or her meeting up with a friend. You were willing to hear her out, but she wasn\u2019t with you.\n\nBoth of your needs are just as important, but you scheduled yours in first. That\u2019s all there should be to it.", "Why couldn't your gf go out for a walk herself and you stay in? Like, I'm in the exact same situation with my partner and if we both had different needs (which we often do) then we're not joined at the hip and could just do our respective things.", "NTA. Is your girlfriend one of those people that can't stand seeing someone else sitting around for 5 minutes without finding something for them to do? Sounds like less of a mental health thing and more of a I don't like seeing you being \"lazy\"", "NTA she is asking you to put her mental health before your own that is a huge red flag! There is no reason you can\u2019t have your day to relax and she can go out and have her day out.", "NTA\n\nMighty convenient that she waited till that morning to suddenly need to go out for her mental health and drag you along. \n\nYou already made plans. She knew about them. She can go out by herself.", "NTA and big red flag right here. Resorting to trying to get her way by saying \u201cbut my mental health!\u201d and ignoring your mental health is a sign of a narcissist. I know you\u2019re not asking about breaking up, but think about how she is going to try and manipulate you in the future like this again.", "NTA. It's troubling that she knew about your plans in advance and still tried to prioritize her needs over yours. It's like she did it on purpose. You two may need to work on whatever that underlying issue is to have a healthy relationship.", "NTA, this is very serious in my eyes, I'd suggest a long talk about boundaries and self-preservation and even some therapy for both of you individually. Unfortunately, if she refuses to accept that you put yourself first, you gotta make some hard decisions.", "NTA. Stay firm on your boundaries and don\u2019t let her get away when crap like that", "NTA - I\u2019m glad to see you stuck to your boundaries", "NTA- and maybe time for some reflection? Does your GF consistently try and undermine your mental health, and use hers as a way to get what she wants?", "The fact that you think you might be an asshole for wanting to practice self care is pretty alarming.  Does she regularly not acknowledge that your feelings/needs matter?", "Codependent much?", "NAH. Sometimes everyone is burnt out. And the less mental energy we have, the harder it is to spend it on others and seeing their perspective. I\u2019m sure normally you\u2019d have no issue taking her out, but on this day you didn\u2019t have it in you to do so. Just like on other days I\u2019m sure she could have understood that and left you alone or made other plans. It sounds like you both need a break and being kind to each other can be hard when you\u2019re both in that state of mind.", "I would not call either of you AHs.

What she wants is the priority because she is the princess.  We ALL struggle with issues.   Who doesn't?", "Lol, NTA, but wait until you\u2019re married.

Why is your mental health more important than mine?  No, why is yours more important than *mine*.  Jesus Krispies what a joke.  Who cares who declared their plans hours ahead of the other.

It isn't your job to be going out every day even if it is your girlfriend.", "NTA. You and your mental health matter too. You offered reasonable alternatives, at that point she was being capricious for wanting YOUR presence in particular. She could've gone out with her friend Sunday and you on Monday.

Good for you for prioritizing your health. Hope you feel better soon.", "No nta. Why should her mental health be more important than yours", "NTA. You told her before Sunday. You explain again, but her actions show she thinks her mental health is more important than yours.", "NTA", "Nta, she can go do her things without you", "NTA.  If she wanted a day trip so badly and you weren't up for it, she should stop nagging you and make plans with a friend.  You said you were going to spend the day chilling at home, if she wanted more activity than that, then that's on her to find a solution that didn't involve you.  This has nothing to do with mental health of anyone, it's about making choices for yourself.

Your mental health is just as important as hers, and you had already communicated your plans for the day in advance. Many people think that resting is simply laziness, but it is important to listen to our bodies and give them what they need when they need it. Resting when needed (not talking about days-long depression sleeping here) is a productive activity because you are actively taking care of yourself in that moment.

That's right, the dopamine chaser goes on their bargain hunt alone while the other one stays at home. That way we both get what we need. Because we're adults who can do things by ourselves now and then.", "NTA to put this in a physical analogy, its like you've each got a broken leg, she's asked you to rub her errands because her leg is broken and when you've suggested \"Could you use a delivery service or ask a friend who doesn't currently have a broken leg to run your errands?\" She's responded by complaining that you don't care that her leg is broken. It's ridiculous", "NTA. You can do things separately. It would really annoy me if my SO couldn't get up and out and do their own thing without me.", "NTA.

I often would oblige but I slowly grew resentful my needs weren\u2019t being respected or considered, despite repeatedly and politely expressing them. I also grew exhausted because I work full time and like to have one day a week (just one!) to lay low around home, it\u2019s how I like to recharge and prep for the next week.

See if you can meet on common ground of care, understanding, and appreciation for one another. \n\nI really hope you both feel better soon!! God luck!!", "What a bad girlfriend. Completely dismissed his mental health needs for her own. Literally as if she should be coming before himself. Selfish.", "It's a double edged sword. I think the recent focus on mental health as a thing we need to watch is great, BUT we are responsible for our own mental health needs.\n\nWe don't all get an emotional support human at our beck and call. And we need to learn how to meet our own needs when an emotional support human isn't available or willing.", "Maybe try communicating and sorting that out? Marriage doesn\u2019t have to suck.", "Why? Why does everything need to be a compromise? He told her his plans to do nothing because he felt burnt out. He tried compromising by suggesting the next day to do stuff.", "Hell no. It's 2023. Men deserve to have their needs met as well as women.", "What about her? Why can\u2019t she put her plans off either? She knew about his plans and waited till day of to ask which makes it worse. The same should be for her. If she has a day off on Monday than why can\u2019t she wait till then?", "They made plans for Sunday.\n\nWhy couldn't gf make plans for a day when, ya know, plans hadn't already been made?", "Key difference in each plan that you're not paying attention to though:\n\nOPs partner wants to leave the house. She does not need OP to do this with her. She can leave alone or go with a friend. It is NOT OPs job to put her mental health over his own, and in fact should be discouraged from doing that because if he's burnt out, he's no use to anyone. Basic care principle. \n\nOPs plan do not impose on his partner in any way. She still has full reign to do exactly what she wants, just without OP. Why should he sacrifice his mental health for another day just to accommodate someone who can do what they want anyway without him?", "One of the biggest game changers about being motivated to go to things for me was exactly this. Booking the Monday off to drive back or chill out if coming back on a Sunday after a weekend event. \n\nNo surprises my better half suggested it\u2026", "or as a loving partner, you can communicate peacefully and plan to address it at a time convenient for both. \u201cShe can Stfu\u201d isn\u2019t good relationship advice.", "If she is half the manipulative abuser I think she is then yes it is.\n\nHe has made it abundantly clear well in advance that he finally needs some time to rest and she is mounting a campaign to rob him off that when he is already vulnerable.\n\nA boundary needs to be set and it is vital that she isn't allowed to pivot and rob him of his day of rest by her replacing it with a day of relationship drama.  A very firm \"not today, I'm resting!\" and literally nothing else is appropriate until she accepts that she can't take that away from him.", "What was he going to do that wouldn't lose self respect? He's burnt out and planned a day for himself and ok it a week in advance, the girlfriend then tries to take over those plans the day of, op suggests a great compromise of her going out with a friend", "How is that not acting like an adult? If anything the gf was the childish one. He made it clear a week in advance his plans for that day. He tried to compromise with her about going out the next day or even if she wanted to go without him or with friends she could. He was absolutely correct that his mental health was just as important as hers. She was trying to trample on that. Unless he was stomping his feet and whining like a little kid then he acted like an adult would.", "He says on a comment thread started by someone doing exactly that.", "Exactly what I was thinking", "Does maintaining one's self respect require intransigence? Does it require digging in one's heels? It still seems neither party behaved with any particular maturity in this situation.  Why does this opinion rankle so?", "No they refused multiple times because they were an AH.\n\nAnd going by your selfish views, why aren't you saying N A H or E S H if they are both acting similarly?\n\nBecause in your world, all you do is take care of yourself without giving a fuck about others. There's a word for that. It's called selfish. There's another word for that. It's called AH.", "Honey, how often do you do what she asks because of her mental health? How much of the mental load are you carrying? Is she getting support? Seeing a therapist? Talking to anyone other than you? Are you feeling burnt out because of this?\n\nYou're allowed to say no to your partner. You're allowed to prioritize your needs. Making plans for yourself on your day off does not make you an asshole. A good therapist can help you determine if this relationship is truly serving your needs or not. You deserve a soft life full of love and a partner who contributes meaningfully to that. You are worthy. \u2764\ufe0f  Be kind to yourself. NTA.", "Yea I recently realized I\u2019m an extrovert (apparently when my mental health is good I actually can function lmao) and my roommate is an introvert. If I want to do something we either have to plan it a few days in advance so she can mentally prepare for it or I have to find someone else. \n\nAnd I know to leave her alone when she needs time because I\u2019m not an AH.", "Let's see...DARVO and \"don't set yourself on fire...\" \n\nI'm sure there's waaay more.", "Lol. True. I also forgot FAFO \ud83d\ude04", "A boundary is just a line you don\u2019t want people to cross. Some are deal breakers, some aren\u2019t. A boundary of mine is don\u2019t watch certain shows around me, but if someone forget, I just mention it. Others, like ultimatums, are basically deal breakers."]}
