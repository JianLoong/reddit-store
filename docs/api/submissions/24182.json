I\u2019m a nursing student, I know that this could be a sign of something serious, so did some tests. When the results came, the doctor told me that my blood is low, and there\u2019s a high chance that I could possibly have PCOS, but we can\u2019t be sure until I do an ultrasound, which they had given me an appointment for for the next month. \n\nMy mom has a friend, basically a family friend, who we\u2019ll call Samantha.

My mom got defensive and said that Samantha\u2019s daughter can help me get free treatment. I yelled and said if her daughter said that PCOS is curable, then she isn\u2019t fit to be a doctor.

But yelling at moms only gives them power. The silent treatment is a much better way of handling that shit. When you yell it makes them feel like you're just an emotional overreacting child and they still have the power to upset you. When you stop telling her things about your life is when she will wake up to her shitty behavior and change her ways.", "NTA, other people have voiced what my opinion is, but I thought I'd mention that gossips cant always control themselves. I'm not excusing her, I'm asking if you think Samanthas daughter would abuse her position as a Doctor to access your medical records. \n\nI know access to the files are generally logged. If you feel like it might happen you may want to look into some form of preventative action to restrict access if thats possible.

It's very unfortunate, but she has proved you can't trust her to keep secrets like this", "That what I literally told my mom, it can only be managed, not cured. And it really bothers me that Samantha\u2019s daughter said it could be cured because she spent 9 years studying to be a doctor, graduated 3 years ago.", "Thank you for your judgement, I feel bad because I could tell my mom was concerned and was hurt by me yelling at her.", "I honestly would\u2019ve been fine if she shared it with someone other than Samantha or my family. My family is known for gossip, a lot of issues has happened because of gossip, my uncle and his wife of 8 years literally divorced because of the gossip.", "She did, this time it was just too personal.", "Luckily she can\u2019t since she\u2019s working in a private hospital. The hospital I\u2019m in can show if a staff viewed your profile, doctor or nurses can get in trouble if they access a patient profile they have no business at.", "I accept your judgment. I could\u2019ve not yell at her, she was just trying to help, she\u2019s my mother after all.", "I know, I would talk to your mum and apologise and explain where you're head was at.", "It might be time to put your mom on an info diet until you both are sure she can handle sensitive information discretely.", "As long as you're confident she can't get info if she goes digging. It sounds outlandish that someone would ruin their medical career over gossip but people have done much stupider things.", "If she wanted to help, she would have booked a doctor\u2019s appointment for you", "Your mom fundamentally violated your privacy. You have every right to yell. If she wanted to help you she would have asked before telling her friend", "Yeah, it could be possible if she used someone else\u2019s account to view my profile.", "Idk where op lives but that may take time or cost money", "Might be worth setting a reminder for a month to ask if anyone has accessed your records then. If not, no harm no foul. If so... Well you know the repercussions and why they're there. Can't do anything about gossip but using her credentials for that would be a massive abuse of her power. \n\nAlso I'd say your mother has proven she can't be trusted with any information more than what you had for lunch. You should consider putting her on an information diet, knowing anything you share with her should be considered public knowledge. I'm sorry you can't have private conversations with your mum.", "Medical care and treatment in my country is free.

Does Samantha\u2019s daughter being a doctor change anything? Like can she get you to skip the line?", "Regardless, I hope it ends up being something curable or atleast fully treatable.

Your mum was gossiping (to relieve her own worry, but that's what a lot of gossip actually is, \u2014shortsighted attempt at relieving social anxiety \u2014it's still indiscreet and gossip). Your mum wasn't getting your medical help. Not at all.\n\n A Dr can't help you via 3rd party gossip. You have your own medical appointments to help you.  \n\nI'd probably tell mum the Dr said it's not PCOS then never trust her again as she is a gossip.  She gossiped about her own daughter! It was obvious that's personal and private information. In-laws broke a promise not to repeat something about me then told me I should tell people. No, it was private. Telling others is unnecessary and unhelpful: it's actually damaging as then people neg you and can cause you nocebo effect.  My relationship with them has abeen frosty since although they would blame me for that too. Sadly family isn't always respecting your boundaries", "NTA\n\nI would be furious with my mom if she did that!! You were so in the right!!!", "NTA. However, while I don't know your mother at all, if she has a history of doing it, I'd suggest that you stop trusting her with that kind of information.

Lots of offences are done by people just being helpful. How could she have thought gossip could help? It's not a medical appointment", "PCOS is incredibly common affecting up to 20% of women. It's not on you to do this but we need to normalize talking about \"women problems\". These were issues that weren't diagnosed in the past because nobody talked about what was and wasn't normal when it came to\"womens problems\" and Drs would just blow wonen off (and by past I mean as recently as 10-15 years ago). I actually dont think either of you are the Ass in this situation. Your mom wants to help you and this is her way of trying to do it. Women need to support each other in these struggles...you may find out you actually know a number of folks with the same issues.", "Or your mum feels hurt for herself feeling guilty because she was called out for doing what she knew was wrong. She broke her own daughter's trust. It's Pride and Prejudice style gossip: a  meaningless compulsion", "Slight YTA.\n\nYour mom was talking to her friend about her daughter. People share things with their friends. I bet you have talked about your family to your friends. Did you tell your mom to keep it to herself? If so, then I'll change my answer. She was just trying to help you. This is really not that big of an issue.", "NTA. No one should be sharing your private medical information without your permission. \n\nIANAD but I will say, if your blood count is low, you should see about having a colonoscopy as well. Doctors have a bit of a blind spot when it comes to menstruation. A study they did some years ago took several women who had been told their low blood count was related to menstruation and found that a significant majority of them actually had a GI bleed. \n\nAlso note that high levels of stress, like say from an intensive schooling program, can also interfere with your menstrual cycle to a significant degree. I know people who stopped having a period for like 3 months from the stress of planning their wedding. \n\nI hope you get this all figured out in a qay that keeps you heakthy. Best of luck.", "NTA.  Your mom is TA.  I had a mom who would tell ppl my business too.  I hated it.  Unfortunately, she would just brush me off whenever I called her on something.  Your mom is telling ppl your business & who cares if Samantha's daughter is a doctor.  She's not your doctor.  And that's who you should be getting your medical advice from, your doctor.", "You shouldn't have yelled at her. YTA for that, but your anger is understandable. I would have asked her what she was planning to do when Samantha and her daughters spread the news about your medical issues. There's a Mexican expression that comes to mind, \"Flies won't go into a closed mouth.\" Unfortunately, you know for a fact that you can't trust her to keep your personal matters confidential. So, now you know that you will have to behave around her the same way you would with Samantha and her daughters.", "There isn\u2019t anything I\u2019m stressed about except this issue. I went to see a doctor at June for the tests, when the the results came out I was assigned to a different doctor, and she dismissed everything, saying I\u2019m fine and just need to relax. When my period haven\u2019t came at all, I went to another doctor, when she saw my tests results, she was surprised that my blood was very low, and she prescribed me iron supplements for 6 months. She also said that my hormones are a little abnormal, so there\u2019s that.", "You can not seriously be comparing a gossipy mom to Hitler", "She was trying to help her own urge to blab about you. When she needs medical help herself does she get it via 3rd party gossip or via a medical appointment? She didn't actually think she was helping you, she was just relieving her own urge to speak about the matter, like pressure building up a kettle about to boil", "Yes all this but also OP isn't officially diagnosed yet and if OP is diagnosed with something else now there's a chance of blame for lying or switching it up.", "The mum owes her an apology. L The mum knows she broke her own daughter's confidence mum deserved the yelling. Gossip is never helpful.", "NTA. Yelling about it isn\u2019t great, but understandable. I love that my mum asks before talking about my health issues, and that\u2019s despite me not really caring about who knows about it and regularly talking about it myself with strangers anyway.", "NTA. This is the main reason I don\u2019t tell my mother anything anymore because she has a big mouth and no tact. I can\u2019t trust her with anything and she doesn\u2019t like that but she doesn\u2019t understand that she\u2019s the problem.", "NTA your mother took your private business to the village loud mouths because she couldn't bother to Google. That's completely messed up, and she needs to go on an info diet since she can't keep herself from blabbing either.", "NTA\n\nYour mom crossed a boundary and you are right for letting her know! The way some moms behave as if their child is their property whose boundaries don\u2019t need to be respected really frustrates me aswell. And then getting defensive instead of admitting her mistake, typical toxic mom behavior.", "Are you sure that Samantha\u2019s daughter claimed it could be cured? Maybe your mum or Samantha misunderstood something or something got mixed up.", "Sorry to say, but she won\u2019t stop"]}
