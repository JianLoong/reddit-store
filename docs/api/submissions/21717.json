(Approximately 6 months). when we met, I told him I am a part time author. I\u2019ve always had a passion for writing, and my ex encouraged me to keep up my hobby. Eventually, I got good enough to feel confident in publishing. Although I am not some big known writer like Stephen king, or Charles Dickens, I make a decent amount of money off it between writing, and my full time job. \nI am currently 100 pages into my newest book, and my bf asked to see a preview. I allowed it and he said there is way too much sex involved. I reminded him the genre I write. (Romance) and he says I have so much talent, but doesn\u2019t see why I need to put porn on paper. I brush this off as not everyone has a liking to romance novels for their own personal reason. \nA week goes by and he sees me working on my novel, and argued that I should change the plot to make it \u201cbetter\u201d. I told him in the nicest way possible I am not looking for feedback. He signed frustrated. I turn around in my chair and say \u201cis there something you\u2019d like to communicate to me?\u201d And his reasoning left me speechless. He goes on to say, he doesn\u2019t like how I am keeping up with this hobby all because my ex was nice enough to encourage it. He believes I secretly write my romance novels as him and I as the main characters and it\u2019s my \u201cperfect little fantasy world\u201d where our relationship would have worked out. I told him how ridiculous he sounds, as this has always been my content, even in that relationship and reminded him that relationship has ended on mutual terms due to myself wanting children someday, and he being very adamant on not having children. (In none of my previous books, or current one have I made a plot where the main characters even have a baby). He is refusing to believe me and thinks it\u2019s something I am choosing not to admit too, and won\u2019t be satisfied until I change my entire book to the plot he has suggested. I told him no, and if this is going to be a problem for him, he needs to figure out if me writing romance is a deal breaker or not. He says my writing isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s what and \u201cwho\u201d I\u2019m writing about. I again argue, my books are fiction, and this is a passion of mine I finally put together for myself. I am fed up with the argument and told him if he feels insecure he can either talk to me about it with out projection, or deal with it himself. He argues back that I am not being empathetic on his feelings and I say \u201cyou\u2019ll get my empathy when you realize my work, and personal life are separate.\u201d Now he is choosing not to speak to me. So, AITA?\n\nTLDR; I write romance novels and my bf of 6 months says the genre is not within his comfort zone and thinks they\u2019re all secretly about my ex who I\u2019ve mutually broke up with due to the difference on how we felt about having children.

He could have gotten some spicy tips \ud83c\udf36, but instead he\u2019s cockblocking your work because of insecurity.", "What an absolute insecure child.", "NTA.... and tell him that it's not your fault that the majority of women who read your stuff probably have asswipe partners who wouldn't know how to even find that little bit with directions from Google maps.\n\nIf he wants you to stop writing, tell him to start educating his homies on how to make more than just bacon sizzle.", "NTA. He\u2019s way too insecure.", "NTA, that would be your current fling demanding either you make him the star or change the plot line or not write.  Next, you have to ask yourself if the relationship is worth keeping because he wants you to not do this hobby so he's going to nitpick at you about anything and everything from past flames to your current story.", "Man is scared of your imagination. Get outta there!", "Ugh babe that sucks. NTA. \n\nAlso, I totally want to read your book when you get published. All I want to read is porn. He sounds like bad news \ud83d\ude41\ud83d\udc7f", "Don\u2019t stay with someone that doesn\u2019t support your creative work. It will destroy you long term.", "NTA. If you were in fact reliving your past relationship with an ex through novel form, then I would have probably voted YTA. Since that would be difficult for your current partner to navigate but it doesn't seem like that's the case here.\n\nIt sounds like your current bf is pretty damn insecure. You might want to really evaluate whether you can put up with that level of insecurity. It usually gets worse rather than better.", "NTA. And he deserves to never be in any real-life hot sex scenes again. DTMFA", "NTA. If you want to stay in a relationship with him you\u2019ll need to sort this out. People who don\u2019t write don\u2019t understand the writing process and imagine lots of incorrect things. \n\nYour bf is insecure. We all are insecure about something. He needs reassurance. Don\u2019t we all? The question is is he willing to try to let it go and are you willing to help. Help -not coddle. \nI always recommend therapy bc a third party with expert knowledge is helpful. \n\nYou could also find examples of other authors whose work is not their life.", "So he's not talking to you anymore? Good! He isn't worth it...at all. NTA You are much more valuable than to waste your energy on an insecure person that wants to control you. Best wishes :-)", "NTA. Drop him, more time to finish your novel!", "NTA. \n\nYour bf is incredibly immature.  None of what he's doing are earmarks of mature, adult relationships.  Insisting that he knows your true intent is essentially calling you a liar. Demanding that you change your novel to assuage his insecurities is irrational and giving you the silent treatment because you won't is childish.\nI don't even have any useful advice or middle ground to suggest. Unless he changes his behavior, there's not much room for resolution.", "NTA romance is the biggest selling genre keep the writing going and ditch the guy", "NTA. Please take everything in that he is says to you. Something that you have been passionate about for long period of time (certainly longer than he\u2019s been around), he largely dislikes if not hates. There is NOTHING that you can do to change his mind. Your writing is part of who you are, and has more staying power in your life then he does. Take a step back from the relationship at the very least (or end it). \n\nDo not consider changing who you fundamentally are to make him \u201chappy\u201d for now. Keep living your life on your terms. Making any concessions are only going to hurt you and strengthen what he would say is your relationship, but is really his control on your life.\nNever give up securing a bag for anyone, especially if you love what you do. \n\nGood luck and keep writing!", "NTA. Boyfriend sounds insecure on lot of levels. Honesty worst kind of partner who rains on other\u2019s parade. And childish to fret over an ex. And to stifle your content because of sexuality. Mildly possessive imo. Keep writing and living your best steamiest written life. Now I\u2019m the ahole here to say this: but for the love of all that\u2019s good plz stop abusing them commas, holy run ons Batman. I say this with great compassion as this was my primary critique I received in my early writing classes. But take it or leave it as you said to your boyfriend, you\u2019re not looking for feedback. If you consider it, try to break those four line long ones down into multiple sentences. As they are, it\u2019s hard to follow the train of thought with the stream of consciousness style ramble. Not grading your novel writing abilities though, surely you\u2019re frustrated venting here. I had to reread handful few times, so bit confusing.", "NTA I suggest you edit the boyfriend out of your life.", "Imagine someone saying you don\u2019t have empathy for them because you won\u2019t completely drop a hobby and change everything about it. This guys nuts", "NTA.  Time to write the boyfriend out of your life.", "NTA", "Your BF is not a partner, he's a road block and a very immature one too!!\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe right partner will help you excel in life, the wrong one will hold you back.

This is a major red flag \ud83d\udea9 so not pass go, do not collect $200", "This post makes me so livid and fired up from personal experiences similar to yours. I am also a romance writer who got herself published but works at it as a hobby. It's astounding how many people freak out about the sex in romance books. Hello! I told you the genre was romance! It's not my fault if you don't read and didn't know what it meant. I've had people tell me a lot of the things you're saying your bf said. Fuck him. And anyone that treats your hard worked for books like anything less than deserving. You are not the asshole, get him out of your life, don't wait for him to decide if he can handle it because it'll always be a problem for him. Keep writing!", "NYA", "NTA. He\u2019s pushing boundaries to see how controlling he can get away with being in the future.

The world needs your words!", "NTA, geez I'm sick and tired of men thinking that they can dictate your life and making sure it revolves around them. \nGood on you OP for not backing down because if you had, it will graduate into other things, what you say, how you dress, who you are friends with, completely eroding your boundaries till you cannot recognise yourself anymore.", "NTA. I\u2019m a novelist myself, so I know all too well when I say non-writers are never gonna properly understand how character creation and development works. While all characters you write are always gonna be an extension of yourself and you\u2019re gonna subconsciously put pieces of yourself in there whether you realize it or not, they also have a mind of their own after a while, and that\u2019s where they no longer are a reflection of you and your fantasies. You\u2019ll have plans for them and they\u2019ll veer hard left instead sometimes. And more often than not, the things that characters do aren\u2019t even things you would choose or support in real life\u2026 cuz it\u2019s not supposed to reflect your real life, it\u2019s escapism\u2026", "He\u2019s the boyfriends of 6 months trying to tell you what to do when it comes to your passion.

Please read this again, \" he doesn\u2019t like how I am keeping up with this hobby all because my ex was nice enough to encourage it.\" He's belittling you and your hard work, and suggesting that it's only allowable when tolerated by the male partner. He will allow it only if you change the plot to suit his ego.\n\nPlease don't give up writing and publishing for any man, but especially not one like this. Ask yourself, is he worth giving up your dreams and creative outlet? Absolutely not. My advice is to dump him.", "You know full well that he is the asshole here. If you don't act accordingly, I think you also have an inkling of how that's likely to turn out for you. good luck.", "He is not the man for you. He is jealous and insecure, and allows those feelings to interfere with his treatment of you and it keeps him from supporting your dreams.  They are YOUR dreams and passions.

Never let anyone cast clouds on your sparkle!", "It's time to get yourself a new boyfriend and keep writing your novel. When someone is sulking about a passion of yours because their values don't align with yours, it is a him problem.
