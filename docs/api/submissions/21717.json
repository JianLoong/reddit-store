(Approximately 6 months). when we met, I told him I am a part time author. I\u2019ve always had a passion for writing, and my ex encouraged me to keep up my hobby. Eventually, I got good enough to feel confident in publishing. Although I am not some big known writer like Stephen king, or Charles Dickens, I make a decent amount of money off it between writing, and my full time job. \nI am currently 100 pages into my newest book, and my bf asked to see a preview. I allowed it and he said there is way too much sex involved. I reminded him the genre I write. (Romance) and he says I have so much talent, but doesn\u2019t see why I need to put porn on paper. I brush this off as not everyone has a liking to romance novels for their own personal reason. \nA week goes by and he sees me working on my novel, and argued that I should change the plot to make it \u201cbetter\u201d. I told him in the nicest way possible I am not looking for feedback. He signed frustrated. I turn around in my chair and say \u201cis there something you\u2019d like to communicate to me?\u201d And his reasoning left me speechless. He goes on to say, he doesn\u2019t like how I am keeping up with this hobby all because my ex was nice enough to encourage it. He believes I secretly write my romance novels as him and I as the main characters and it\u2019s my \u201cperfect little fantasy world\u201d where our relationship would have worked out. I told him how ridiculous he sounds, as this has always been my content, even in that relationship and reminded him that relationship has ended on mutual terms due to myself wanting children someday, and he being very adamant on not having children. (In none of my previous books, or current one have I made a plot where the main characters even have a baby). He is refusing to believe me and thinks it\u2019s something I am choosing not to admit too, and won\u2019t be satisfied until I change my entire book to the plot he has suggested. I told him no, and if this is going to be a problem for him, he needs to figure out if me writing romance is a deal breaker or not. He says my writing isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s what and \u201cwho\u201d I\u2019m writing about. I again argue, my books are fiction, and this is a passion of mine I finally put together for myself. I am fed up with the argument and told him if he feels insecure he can either talk to me about it with out projection, or deal with it himself. He argues back that I am not being empathetic on his feelings and I say \u201cyou\u2019ll get my empathy when you realize my work, and personal life are separate.\u201d Now he is choosing not to speak to me. So, AITA?\n\nTLDR; I write romance novels and my bf of 6 months says the genre is not within his comfort zone and thinks they\u2019re all secretly about my ex who I\u2019ve mutually broke up with due to the difference on how we felt about having children. He says I am not considering how he feels, to which I said I\u2019ll consider how he feels when he realizes my work and personal romance life are different.", "created_utc": 1688867685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ulw8k/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_i_am_going_to_write/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now you've got some new ideas for antagonist characteristics to work with too.", "NTA\n\nI don't think he's going to believe you no matter what.

I tend toward the dark fantasy/horror genre, and there is no way in HELL that my personal life overlaps some of the shit I write.

That needs to be addressed, but for that, he has to recognize it... Which is unlikely to happen at the moment, seeing how adamant he is at putting the blame on you.\n\nAlso, even if your novel was about you and your ex... It is still a novel, a fiction. It's like a kink/sexual fantasy: not all of them are to be played out in reality, but it is still fine to fantasize about it.\n\nWhich gets me thinking... how do you think your bf would react if he learned you watch porn with male actors that have nothing to do with him physical/in appearance? Would he still try to blame you/try to control you?", "Keep on writing. You bring joy and agency to your readers. It\u2019s a gift. This guy can give you nothing so good. You do not need his resentment, insecurity, and self righteous attempts at control.", "NTA. It's important to have a partner that supports you and wants the same things you do (hence the ending of your previous relationship). Clearly the guy you're dating believes that he has the right to interfere with your work and your passion. He does not. \n\nYou said you've been dating for just six months, and he's doing this? It's going to get worse if you stay, believe me. He'll start telling you where you can go, who you can see, etc. Cut this insecure child loose and save your time and energy for a real man who will add to your life, not take away from it.", "NTA and this is a hill to die on.  He is being this controlling after 6 months?  About fiction that you actually make part of your living on?\n\nAnyone who can actually write and get published deserves kudos, not the disrespect and BS he is giving you.  (I wouldn't even care if it WAS porn myself.  If my partner could make ANY money writing ANYTHING I'd be ecstatic).\n\nThere is no point in arguing.  Just tell him this is how it is and if he doesn't drop it IMMEDIATELY AND FOREVER you are done.\n\nPersonally I think if you go down this slippery slope you'll be barefoot and pregnant OR constantly arguing and likely abused.  This is so controlling.\n\nMyself I'd just drop him.", "NTA.

NO ONE gets to censor what I write.  Your bf is incredibly insecure if he thinks your novels are about your ex.  Your writing contributes to your financial success.
