If you're the only one away from the family, I think it's up to you to visit, although grandparents should make the effort too. If they expect YOU to visit, then YOU choose how often and when. Those who want to see you more often are welcome to come.\n\nIt's time to have a discussion with your husband about lowering the number of visits. If he refuses, tell him he's free to go and handle the kids while you rest and enjoy your bed. He may soon change his mind.\n\nNTA", "NTA- I would tell your husband he can take the kids by himself- that he will have to do everything- pack the bags, get extra snacks, drinks etc. and then the kids must be home at their normal bedtime if he wants help putting them down cuz otherwise he will have to do it and their will be no giving him a break the next day bc you \u201cgot time off\u201d", "NTA.\n\n>we make the 3 hour drive multiple times a month\n\n>In the past decade my husbands family has made the trip out to see us less than 5 times.\n\nYour husband must really enjoy car journeys. It's a pity he's not bothered about you and your children.", "NTA\n\nThis family dynamic is toxic. \n\nYou're absolutely within your rights to do so.\n\nMy father's family took precedence over my mother's family when I was a kid in terms of holidays.\n\nI lost out on a lot of time that I could've had with family members on my mother's side that passed away due to cancer and other diseases.\n\nThe only way this gets better is if both families are visited equally 50%\n\nAND \n\nThat the In-laws family make the trip to your place when it is an event that is hosted there (family birthdays, taking turns for christmas/thanksgivings/etc, alternating holidays, etc etc)\n\nLess the fact that it is also a large gas sink to drive there all the time, they don't seem to value the fact that you show up to those events all the time and take it for granted.\n\nDon't back down, demand 50%.", "NTA. Any relationship needs to be two way. The visits back and forth doesn\u2019t need to be one-for-one, but they can certainly make some kind of effort than they do now, make you feel more than someone who shows up for command performances while they stay comfortably at their own home.", "INFO: How big is the extended family? For example, does he have three siblings who each have two kids so we're talking a gathering at Grandma's that includes four cars and fifteen grandkids?\n\n(I'm leaning towards N-T-A honestly, but sometimes there's just practicality - I drag my family six hours each way to see my extended family because it's literally four housefuls of people in one place and then my one at the other.)", "Once a month is enough considering how long the drive is imho.", "There comes a time in every young family's life where they do put the brakes on long trips with their little ones. Whether the other families come to you for holidays or other events is up to them, but traveling with young children is tedious at best. An hour and a half seems like a million years to them. At least a teenager can stay at home or use their electronic devices while riding.", "NTA \nI had the same issue until one Christmas day we were on the road for 6 hours, and it essentially ruined Christmas for my children.\n\nSo Christmas, Easter, and our kids' birthdays we stayed home. They could come to our house but we weren't going anywhere.\n\nThanksgiving, and the in-laws' birthdays, and their anniversary, we would go there. \nWe also only traveled to see them once every three months outside of the holidays/special days listed above.\nThis has to be a hard boundary you set and don't deter unless it's an emergency.", "As long as you don\u2019t keep him and the kids from going, I think you aren\u2019t the AH. If you\u2019re trying to stop your whole family from visiting then yes you are.", " NTA.   A 90 minute drive with teenagers is way easier than with little kids. They can all make the trip at least a few times a year. And no way you should be going multiple times a month if they don\u2019t reciprocate.", "NTA. You don't get to have access to the children of someone who you don't treat well. And you get what you give in life", "NTA Maybe your husband could drive the kids there by himself? You could get a spa treatment in the meantime: win-win. I'm betting he will be less eager to take care of 2 small children on his own, and more willing to compromise.\n\nI had a person like your in-laws in my family and it hurt that they never wanted to visit me. Just be honest with them and say it's too exhausting and they're welcome to come themselves. If they laugh, well \"I'm sorry you don't want to see your grandchildren\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My in-laws include my BIL and his wife and four kids, a SIL, and my MIL and FIL (MIL passed away two years ago). They've always lived 11ish hours from our family (except SIL lives even farther). We all were able to split the travel 50/50 and their location is the epitome of a small town. \nBest course of action is to talk to them. Explain the strain, gas $$$$, the time away from your own home. It's definitely unfair for them to not make more of an effort. But before you talk to them, definitely talk to your husband and make sure your both a united front on this.", "Info: how often are you visiting with your family and are they nearby?", "NTA. With two toddlers, you drive there several times a month? That\u2019s excessive. Your husband needs to set some boundaries.\n\nOP\u2019s husband-this is NOT normal. You have two toddlers. Why won\u2019t your family come to see you?", "Even without small children, that's a lot of travel.", "NTA", "NTA  tell your husband he's welcome to take the kids by himself as much as he wants, you're not going.", "NTA\n\nIve fought exactly this fight.  We live roughly 2 hours from all of the grandparents.  \n\nMy mother made frequent trips to visit.  My FIL and his wife made occasional trips.  My father barely made the trip and my MIL only a couple of times total in 35 years. \n\nMy kids know my mother and my FIL much better than the others.", "We live 5 hours from my fam. In the 20 years I\u2019ve lived here we always made the drive. My aunts have visited the area twice, my mom 5 times, my brother maybe 10 times (he was in the area for work and needed a place to stay).\n\nAll holidays? It was us traveling. 9 months pregnant or when the kid was an infant. Always us. \n\nWe just stopped. I don\u2019t hear from any of them any more. Silence and not driving all over is amazing.", "NTA. Visiting should be more split. It doesn't have to be an even split, but they should male the trip more. Your husband enabling this is unfair. I would personally not interfere with him going. He can go as much as he wants. But the kids can stay with mom.", "Exactly. The interstate goes both ways. The responsibility to maintain relationships isn\u2019t only on OP.", "Normal i would say it would be up to op family to travel. However its only op husband parents, sister, bil and four teenage kids. Thats not a lot of people for them to occasionally travel.", "They are great people- but refuse to leave their small town ever. We\u2019ve offered to host holidays and got laughed out of the room. I\u2019m grateful for them but sick of being the only one to put in effort. It\u2019s so much driving with little ones.", "Def a fair question. It\u2019s his mom and dad, then sister with her husband and 4 kids out there. We would never expect them to come here for every holiday or anything like that- but ONCE a year would be nice??", "This sounds like a good question. It's much easier to move 4-5 people than 20. Is it a question of logistics and cost per person or just general assholery.", "I\u2019d never stop them from going. I\u2019m just hanging back now.", "I asked my husband if he thought they\u2019d ever see their grandkids again if we didn\u2019t drive them out there- and he said no. They are that set in their ways.", "That\u2019s part of the problem. I think it needs to be discussed but they are NOT a family that hashes things out. So my husband will just continue to make the ride a few times a month. Don\u2019t get me wrong- I appreciate and like my in laws veryyyy much. But I\u2019m just so frustrated with hauling two toddlers around all the time and never getting a visit in return.", "My mom and stepdad  lives 6 hours away and she comes here a few times a year and we go there maybe 2 or 3 times.", "If they laughed you out of the room, I would seriously reconsider ever going back to their town ever again.\n\nThat screams to me that they don't respect you and if they want to see you, they can do it on your terms from now on.\n\nAlso great people don't laugh at people's wants and needs.", "Is your home big enough for if they decide to stay the night?", "It sounds like you have done all the things to show the ILs that you want to have a relationship with them. The fact that they don\u2019t show interest in your child/family nor reciprocate the drive back and forth says a lot. I\u2019m hoping that you and your husband will create a great network of chosen family that you all can enjoy spending your time with. These people don\u2019t deserve you investing any more energy in this situation.", "Yep and we\u2019ve let them know that. It\u2019s just so frustrating. They live 90 minutes from us and we\u2019re last here in June of 2022", "I would take a step back too"]}
