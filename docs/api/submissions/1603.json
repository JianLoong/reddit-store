They were not getting immediate results, so with the oldest sister\u2019s wedding coming up in 2 weeks, the boyfriend on speakerphone with my whole family (minus me and my boyfriend) threatened to show up at the wedding and spread a nasty rumor and ruin not only the wedding, but the marriage. The oldest sister caved and gave him what he wanted so she could try to enjoy her wedding. I reached out to my middle sister (27) before the wedding and let her know that my boyfriend and I were no longer comfortable hosting her boyfriend at our home for holiday events or on vacations that we pay for/host. This threw her and him into a tailspin that has been ongoing for over a month now. They completely ignored us at the oldest sister\u2019s wedding and continue to send me texts imploring me to change my mind, as well as asking other family members to pressure me. A couple of weeks ago I went to visit my parents and my sister (27), who lives with them, was home. Once she saw I was there, she called him and put him on speakerphone and let him say all kinds of hurtful and untrue things to me, such as that I am not capable of emotions and have no feelings, I am a horrible sister, all I care about is controlling other people, I have a vendetta against him, etc. Because they obviously were not done discussing this, I asked that they stop talking to me about it and talk to my boyfriend if they want to. My boyfriend called and sent a text, no response to either. There has been no further communication with either of them since this. He moved back home with his parents to FL in August and has been unemployed his whole life and my sister works part time, so this disagreement is their whole focus.

At this point I'd think your whole family would be ready to cut ties with your sister too.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and check that LinkedIn.", "NTA. WTHeck? LinkedIn profiles are public. What is the big deal about looking at it? \n\nThe guy sounds like an absolute joy to be around. /s", "He's an abusive asshole. Your sister is in danger and I hope she ends the relationship soon and finds a better-hearted person. You're not the asshole for wanting to have peaceful, enjoyable times without him.", "NTA\n\n>I am not capable of emotions and have no feelings, I am a horrible sister, all I care about is controlling other people, I have a vendetta against him, etc.\n\nThis is what they are doing. Cut them out of your lives.", "NTA\n\nIt's your choice to whom you want to spend your money on, and you don't want to spend it on people who act childish. It's fair.", "NTA, but all of you made a huge mistake! You never give in or negotiate with a terrorist and this guy is an emotional terrorist and blackmailer. Your sister should have told your other sister and her slimy boyfriend, if they try to show up at her wedding, they'll be escorted off the premises by security or the police. Why would you even sit there and listen to all the garbage he spewed at you over the phone? HANG UP!!\n\nFunny! This boyfriend of hers has some big balls when it comes to intimidating women, but when a man confronts him, he slithers away and hides. Of course he won't answer your boyfriend! He has no spine and he's certainly unbalanced. Distance yourself from this nut and your sister.", "NTA. Hopefully your family will be fed up with him soon too. I'd disinvite the sister as well, she's the one who put him on speakerphone and didn't hang up immediately.  HOWEVER, he  may be very deliberately driving her apart from her family and manipulating her. Let her know that if she realizes who he is and leaves him, she'll have a place to stay with you (or, if she'll stay with your parents, that you'll support her decision). He's going to alienate the lot of you and then, sadly, chances are good he'll start in on her. Then again, he could just be a general AH and she's willing to let him be the center of drama.", "Nta...this drama was not caused by you and you are doing something to actively avoid it. You have no need to feel guilty for not putting up with childlike tantrums. Besides, anything you are paying for is completely up to you anyways. You don't need a reason at all to tell someone you aren't including them in something you are funding. And stuff like vacations?! far too expensive for any adult to feel entitled to", "NTA.\n\nHe sounds unhinged. Stand your ground, if you did invite him you just know he would ruin it or destroy your stuff.", "NTA\n\n\nThey don't want to talk to your boyfriend because they know they will get nowhere.  They are BAD WORDs and would rather try to pull the same BS on you cause it worked on your sister for her wedding.\n\n\n\nHonestly rid them from your life.", "NTA. The boyfriend is irrationally mad about his LinkedIn being checked out, huh? I\u2019d keep digging, but that\u2019s just me.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds potentially dangerous. You don't need to deal with this insanity.", "Not related to the content of post, but including fake names and some paragraphs will help readers out. Just a suggestion\n\nEdit: sorry NTA", "NTA, but please be careful in cutting him off such that you don\u2019t cut your sister off as well.  She needs options for when she needs to flee this horrible man.", "NTA. *He threatened to ruin your sister's wedding because she looked at his LinkedIn*. You're refusing to be blackmailed and extorted by an unstable person.  It's totally reasonable to assume that he'd take offence to *something* about you, what would he do to your home and events? Better to do this now and keep him out of your home. Let him rant and shout about you all he wants, he's the one that no one is going to want to speak to (and your sister along with him).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
