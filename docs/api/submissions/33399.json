You are entitled to your feelings, but hating your parents isn\u2019t going to benefit you in any way. It sounds like your parents have become healthier people than they once were, and that could potentially translate into them being better and more loving parents now. \n\nYou have a lot of wounds from your childhood, and your feelings of hurt and abandonment are warranted. If your parents really have grown as human beings they may be prepared to make amends. Hating them closes off that option.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe them forgiveness, but you should think about the potential for better things that could come from opening that door. If nothing else, I would really encourage you to pursue therapy to resolve the years of pent-up hurt you have inside you.", "NTA.\n\nRemember, though:\n\nYou do have the right to feel anything.\n\nYou do not have the right to act on those feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It works wonders.", "Remind your stepdad that he wasn\u2019t around from the time of the divorce until you moved out. He didn\u2019t witness the vitriol or the nosebleeds or the complete disregard for your needs as their child, and therefore has no right or ability to judge the legitimacy of your pain.", "No. They want OP to apologize for telling the truth.", "That I said that I hate them", "Exactly.", "NTA. Your little brother is a do-over. Your parents wrote you off and then replaced you. That's what happened.\n\nThe fact that your parents haven't acknowledged the harm they caused you, let alone apologized for it, shows that they're not worth your time anymore. They sent stepdad, who wasn't around for your childhood, to do their dirty work.\n\nI don't even know your parents, and I hate them too.", "Ahh.  The accused responding with righteous indignation.... nope they are not gonna admit their failures.  Sad but true.

I hope you can heal from this, eventually, and enjoy a happy life, even when not around your 3 parents.

I know cutting your parenta out of your life hurts but these people have never wanted you well and done a whole lot of harm, proceeding through life on your own will be the better option.\n\n  \nand get some therapy from a therapist that don't preach reconciliation at all cost.", "NTA", "The least they should do is try to understand your feelings. They owe you that. NTA", "NTA. You grew up early because you had to look after themselves. Your parents are now showing you what could have been and you are grieving that it wasn't. And they made that conscious choice to put themselves over your needs. It is fair to be angry.\n\nAsfor your step-dad, tell him that he is yet an (other) adult telling you that your needs as a child were secondary to his co-parents' emotions and desire to hurt one another. And would he really want that for his son? Your parents absented themselves emotionally from your life and though you may be happy for your brother's sake they have matured, you are not going to apologise for telling how they made you feel. It is part of growing up to realise that actions have consequences and can't just be swept under carpet to make the less involved feel good.", "NTA.", "Stay low contact with him until they decide to grow up themselves", "Reconciliation can't happen when the side that did the wrong isn't willing to accept accountability. They wouldn't even admit what they did wrong, let alone apologize. \n\nRemaining no-contact with his parents can benefit OP in one very important way: it guarantees they won't get close enough to hurt him again.", "they're not better people when they blame OP for not loving them for being emotionally abusive and failing him in every way. you can't reconcile with people who won't acknowledge that they fucked up in major fashion. The very first step on healing that relationship would be the parents owning up and massively apologizing to OP.\n\nAnd anger can lead to growth and healing, we need yo stop pretending that it can't because abusers are too uncomfortable having to deal with even the mildest consequence of the harm they did.", "Your experience isn't universal", "Why are you still talking to these people? Like legitimately, why? They don't care about you, by the sounds of it they never have, and you're rightfully resentful of it. NTA, but not sure why you bother to be in contact with them at all.", "Probably because OP loves his brother. I've found loved children is the top reason people keep communication with family abusers.", "probably to keep contact with lil bro, OP was pretty much abandoned by their parents so they don't want to do the same to another kid."]}
