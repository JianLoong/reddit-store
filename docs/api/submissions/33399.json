They owe you that. NTA", "NTA. You grew up early because you had to look after themselves. Your parents are now showing you what could have been and you are grieving that it wasn't. And they made that conscious choice to put themselves over your needs. It is fair to be angry.\n\nAsfor your step-dad, tell him that he is yet an (other) adult telling you that your needs as a child were secondary to his co-parents' emotions and desire to hurt one another. And would he really want that for his son? Your parents absented themselves emotionally from your life and though you may be happy for your brother's sake they have matured, you are not going to apologise for telling how they made you feel. It is part of growing up to realise that actions have consequences and can't just be swept under carpet to make the less involved feel good.", "NTA.", "Stay low contact with him until they decide to grow up themselves", "Reconciliation can't happen when the side that did the wrong isn't willing to accept accountability.

The very first step on healing that relationship would be the parents owning up and massively apologizing to OP.\n\nAnd anger can lead to growth and healing, we need yo stop pretending that it can't because abusers are too uncomfortable having to deal with even the mildest consequence of the harm they did.", "Your experience isn't universal", "Why are you still talking to these people?

You did grow up, and if they don't like how you are now, that's on them for not being the adults and helping you grow up when you needed them to. They have only themselves to blame if they don't like the result of leaving a kid to figure it out for himself.", "NTA, your dad definitely deserved that comment. Remember that it is not because they are your parents that you have to talk to them. Sometimes it is better to cut ties (even only temporarily) with toxic people who make you feel less than you are worth. You opened your heart and your father brushed off your feelings, maybe going no contact for a few weeks/months would make them appreciate you more.", ">My stepdad texted me and said I should apologize and that they all think I should grow up.\n\nYou did grow up. Alone, forgotten, and in a broken home with parents who hated each other. And it was all for nothing because clearly they CAN do better. They just chose not to for you. They sucked then, and they still are choosing to suck for you now, rather than acknowledging they obviously messed up. I'm enraged on your behalf. NTA", ">\u201dI said I have the right to feel anyway I want.\u201d\n\nI seriously doubt that you *want* to feel this way.  You were neglected and subjected to a household of anger.  Now you witness the fact that your parents were capable showing love to a child; they simply weren\u2019t capable of showing love to *you* as a child.  There are no pictures of them kissing you, adoring you, beaming at you together.  There are no loving texts, no \u201cthank you for sharing this fabulous child person with me\u201d moments.  There were no happy coparenting adults participating in your school events or celebrating your milestones, despite your (over)achievements.\n\nYou were then and are now absolutely deserving of the same level of devotion this child receives.  Your parents simply weren\u2019t capable of it back then.  They, like so many parents, are like reformed criminals or \u2018saved\u2019 sinners.  They prefer to forget their crimes or their past sins - and showcase their reformed lives or current spotless lives.  In your case, the replacement child has thrown into sharp relief the difference in treatment that you received versus that which he receives.  \n\nI do hope you find an excellent therapist to help you navigate your feelings.  You are not alone.  This happens in all kinds of families.  Older kids see younger kids get more mature parents because the parents made their mistakes on the first ones.  Or the step kids get much better parents from the same people that were failures to their own kids.  It hurts.  All your parents see is a 24-year-old that is acting jealous of a 6-year-old.  It is so much deeper.  A la Good Will Hunting, insert Robin Williams\u2019 voice: \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.  It\u2019s not your fault.  It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d  \n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA. They hurt you and now want an apology for them hurting you.
