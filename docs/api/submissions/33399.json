You are entitled to your feelings, but hating your parents isn\u2019t going to benefit you in any way. It sounds like your parents have become healthier people than they once were, and that could potentially translate into them being better and more loving parents now. \n\nYou have a lot of wounds from your childhood, and your feelings of hurt and abandonment are warranted. If your parents really have grown as human beings they may be prepared to make amends. Hating them closes off that option.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe them forgiveness, but you should think about the potential for better things that could come from opening that door. If nothing else, I would really encourage you to pursue therapy to resolve the years of pent-up hurt you have inside you.", "NTA.\n\nRemember, though:\n\nYou do have the right to feel anything.\n\nYou do not have the right to act on those feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Parents mess up to. And even if they don\u2019t express it to you, they love with the guilt, they\u2019re not oblivious they probably both noticed they also neglected u. As someone who was neglected also, it\u2019s honestly easier to genuinely forgive them. Holding grudges doesn\u2019t make the abandonment go away. It doesn\u2019t make you forget, it just adds another negative feeling on something already negative.", "Ah, yes. The sarcasm to hide the pain.
