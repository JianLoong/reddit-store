The other students who went with us are in a different year.\n\nI ended up doing schoolwork until the last minute and didn't prepare my presentation for the conference in advance (though everyone else seemed to be in a similar boat).

I thought I could do this in the morning, so I set my alarm a few hours before my talk and went to sleep.\n\nI wake up to my friend [20F] banging on the door. My talk is in five minutes, why am I not downstairs? I'm like oh no, my alarm didn't get off. My boyfriend says my alarm did get off and he turned it off. I jump into my clothes and run downstairs with my presentation, no makeup and hair tied behind my head in 2 seconds. I get there on time to take the stage (they wouldn't let you take the stage if you were late).\n\nI stumbled through an overlong presentation and got cut three quarters of the way through. I was doubly nervous because we were the only ones from a non-English-speaking country and university and it was my first time in an English-speaking crowd in an English-speaking country. I spoke rather slowly and then looked like I wasn't intelligent enough to prepare a presentation that's the right length.\n\nAfter my talk, I went back to my room, and I started crying. I told my boyfriend that he had no right to touch my alarm. The alarm was on my phone, the phone was on my side, he had to have gotten up, stopped my alarm, and gone back to sleep. He said the alarm was annoying so he turned it off. Then I was like \"then why didn't you wake me up?\". But he was adamant that the alarm was loud enough and if he heard it then I must have heard it too and it was my fault for not waking up. I was like \"you can't turn off someone's alarm\" and he was like \"you are crazy, I did nothing wrong\". He said I am a huge asshole, he did nothing wrong, he doesn't want to hear about it ever again, and he doesn't want to see me for the rest of the trip.\n\nMy friend was there for all of this. She stayed out of it, but when my boyfriend asked her who she sided with, she said she agreed with my boyfriend. We left and she suggested I spend the day with her to forget about it.\n\nThe next day, I wasn't emotional anymore, I accepted I did something wrong, I apologized to my friend, and once my boyfriend agreed to talk after the trip, I apologized to my boyfriend, said he was right, I was wrong.", "created_utc": 1683928111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fy61c/aita_for_reacting_poorly_when_my_boyfriend_turned/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He could have woken you up or at least tried to wake you up before switching it off. Would have been different if he kept trying with no luck, but that didn\u2019t happen.

Too incredible. This must be bs.", " NTA- my husband will sleep through his alarm. What I will do is push him or tap him until he wakes up and shuts it off.

And it worked. You let it happen once, it will happen again. And not just with the alarm. This will escalate as he will push how far he can go. Don\u2019t let him. Stop it right here. One and done.", "I'm a night owl. I sometimes spend the night with a friend who's an early bird. Sometimes I hear her alarm first, and it drives me nuts because it's way before I want to be up. But because I know she wants to be up, I elbow her until she does something about it. This is what you do for someone whose basic wants and needs you care about. Your boyfriend is apparently no such person.\n\nNTA, and please ask him why he felt he had the right to make decisions on your behalf. He's still mad about it? How does he have the right to be mad at all, when he was the one taking your agency away from you?", "NTA your boyfriend is an idiot and your friend wants to bang him", "NTA\n\n\n\nAs other ppl said already in the comments, you deserve better! \n\n\nThat was important to you and he messed it up for you, instead of helping and being supportive.

People set alarms for a reason, especially when you\u2019re at a conference, you don\u2019t just turn off somebody else\u2019s alarm. And what is this shit about \u201cyou must have heard it too,\u201d I mean he turned off your phone that was right next to you, he can visually confirm whether you\u2019re asleep or not.

In a healthy relationship even if you strongly disagree with someone, you hear them out. You try to see the other person\u2019s point of view. Here all I see is you coming to adopt his point of view because he outright refuses to hear yours. I\u2019m not going to say this is abusive because there\u2019s no evidence yet, but this is how people slide into patterns of abuse. You are not the asshole, his actions created the situation, his tantrum when you called him out put him clearly in the AH category.\n\n>\tI accepted I did something wrong, I apologized to my friend, and once my boyfriend agreed to talk after the trip, I apologized to my boyfriend, said he was right, I was wrong.\n\nHe was not right. He was completely wrong.", "YTA for apologizing to him \nDump that selfish and Immature man", "NTA. Near-strangers in shared hostel rooms are kinder than your boyfriend. They won't wake you up, but they won't turn your alarm off and get mad at you for getting mad about it! Your boyfriend is not acting angry because his feelings are hurt, he just doesn't respect you.", "NTA dump him", "This made me furious. Very honest question, why do you consider either of them your friends? NTA", "NTA. As someone who has a very difficult time waking up, for no fault of my own, that was a real jerk move of your bf. Partners are supposed to raise you up.", "I agree with all of this but want to add that OPs so called friend should have not taken the boyfriends side. Not because she\u2019s OPs friend but because boyfriend was in the wrong. \n\nIf OP was in the wrong then yes friend should be a friend and point that out. But in this instance boyfriend was wrong and friend should\u2019ve been supportive", "NTA and boyfriend was definitely in the wrong. The whole \"the alarm woke me up so it should have woken you up\" is a bogus argument. PLUS a true partner (or even a friend) would've made sure OP was awake and would've done whatever possible for OP to have the best possible presentation. That is the exact opposite of turning off an alarm without making sure the person who set the alarm is actually awake.", "I apologized for my outburst and for saying in an accusatory tone that it was wrong to turn off my alarm. My friend wasn't involved in the argument, but she was still a witness. I feel like it's not common to cry in front of people and I was crying pretty hard and they both seemed to think I was being a baby or crazy.\n\nMy friend sided with him, but it didn't cause any issue between her and me. She suggested I hang out with her to get my mind off the incident and that's what we did. We visited the city, went to the clubs, walked through the city at night. I thought her advice to just try to have fun was pretty mature.", "I didn't snooze the alarm. I don't know how long it went off for.", "And a better friend!! Your boyfriend was absolutely in the wrong and so is your friend. It's a no brainer. You don't touch someone else's stuff without permission. You definitely don't mess with their alarm. And if you MUST turn it off because you're sharing a room, obviously you wake them up. Roommates deal with this shit all the time. \n\nI could never imagine making my **partner** nearly miss an important presentation and then expect them to apologise to me. He should be apologising to you!!", "he was wrong to turn off the alarm.\n\nacute stress at being rushed for an important event and feeling humiliated at a huge opportunity for your academic career is a common thing to cry about. it's not a sign of immaturity or \"crazy\".\n\nsorry to tell you but your friend and your boyfriend are both shitty people.", "because he did something shitty and inconsiderate and is now trying to turn it around and play the victim so you're the one apologizing and he gets off scott free. he's manipulating", "Oh dear.  Your boyfriend has zero reason to be mad.  But he (and your \"friend\") have convinced you that you were wrong when you were not.  Now he's dragging it out and punishing you.  This is very controlling and manipulative behavior and those things are warning signs of future, escalating abuse.  Please take some time to consider - without asking your gaslighting friend - how your boyfriend makes you feel on a regular basis.  Are you the one who always apologizes, even when you didn't do anything wrong?  Do you have to make significant effort to keep everything smooth and ok so your boyfriend doesn't get mad?  Do you do only the things he wants to do?  Just think about that stuff and if it's not happening - great!  Maybe this was an isolated asshole moment for him, but the fact that he's still mad and you apologized is worrisome.  Good luck OP", "He\u2019s angry you held him accountable for his actions. This will not go away.", "Nope. He's the asshole and double that because he made you apologize for his poor behavior.  \n\nI don't believe him anyway. No one with any respect for their partner would just turn off an alarm and go back to bed. He either turned it off on purpose to sabotage you or he is just extremely self centered. \n\nHe's still being an asshole about it, which makes me think it was in purpose because people overreact and drag that kind of thing out so you feel at fault.", "Did your boyfriend mention how long it was going off for? Why would your friend side with him? Surely this was discussed.", "It wasn't discussed because duration was not something that he brought up in his defense. He didn't say \"it went on for so long I turned it off\". It was just that it was loud enough to wake him up so he went to turn it off. Even if I ask him, I don't think he looked at the time when he turned it off. But I don't think it could have gone on for that long because I wake up with this alarm every day so I don't think I can sleep through this alarm for several minutes. He must have turned it off pretty quickly.\n\nWe also didn't discuss why my friend sided with him. We knew my boyfriend and I didn't see eye to eye and she was this neutral observer who didn't have a dog in the fight so we weren't going to argue with her. I mean she had nothing to do with it, she just gave her opinion. And then when I hung out with her we didn't care about it, we just moved on and it wasn't weird between us.", "Or it didn't go off.", "If my boyfriend said it never went off, I would have believed it and been none the wiser, but he said it went off and he turned it off, and he described that happening.", "I'm saying I don't buy his story. I think he turned it off before it went off. \n\nYou said you worked on the presentation in the evening but you didn't state being up super late. This is your normal alarm. You were in a hotel room, most people don't sleep as heavily in hotel rooms. Somehow you slept through your normal alarm, in a strange place, and slept through your boyfriend getting up, going around, turning off an alarm that was going off, and back into bed. \n\nNow days later, he's still being an asshole about everything. To me that reads as suspicious but maybe he's just a garden variety asshole."]}
