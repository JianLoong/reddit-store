In a healthy relationship even if you strongly disagree with someone, you hear them out. You try to see the other person\u2019s point of view. Here all I see is you coming to adopt his point of view because he outright refuses to hear yours. I\u2019m not going to say this is abusive because there\u2019s no evidence yet, but this is how people slide into patterns of abuse. You are not the asshole, his actions created the situation, his tantrum when you called him out put him clearly in the AH category.\n\n>\tI accepted I did something wrong, I apologized to my friend, and once my boyfriend agreed to talk after the trip, I apologized to my boyfriend, said he was right, I was wrong.\n\nHe was not right.

Your boyfriend has zero reason to be mad.  But he (and your \"friend\") have convinced you that you were wrong when you were not.  Now he's dragging it out and punishing you.  This is very controlling and manipulative behavior and those things are warning signs of future, escalating abuse.  Please take some time to consider - without asking your gaslighting friend - how your boyfriend makes you feel on a regular basis.  Are you the one who always apologizes, even when you didn't do anything wrong?  Do you have to make significant effort to keep everything smooth and ok so your boyfriend doesn't get mad?  Do you do only the things he wants to do?  Just think about that stuff and if it's not happening - great!

No one with any respect for their partner would just turn off an alarm and go back to bed.

Why would your friend side with him? Surely this was discussed.", "It wasn't discussed because duration was not something that he brought up in his defense. He didn't say \"it went on for so long I turned it off\". It was just that it was loud enough to wake him up so he went to turn it off. Even if I ask him, I don't think he looked at the time when he turned it off. But I don't think it could have gone on for that long because I wake up with this alarm every day so I don't think I can sleep through this alarm for several minutes. He must have turned it off pretty quickly.\n\nWe also didn't discuss why my friend sided with him. We knew my boyfriend and I didn't see eye to eye and she was this neutral observer who didn't have a dog in the fight so we weren't going to argue with her. I mean she had nothing to do with it, she just gave her opinion. And then when I hung out with her we didn't care about it, we just moved on and it wasn't weird between us.", "Or it didn't go off.", "If my boyfriend said it never went off, I would have believed it and been none the wiser, but he said it went off and he turned it off, and he described that happening.", "I'm saying I don't buy his story.

You weren't in the wrong and there was no reason for you to apologize and he knows it. He wanted to fight and he wanted to hurt you. This relationship is not going anywhere good. NTA and I wish you all the best in getting the fuck away from this boy.", "There are many variables to sleep and conditions around. I suppose you were very tired and the bed was extra comfortable. \ud83d\ude04\n\nWhile my alarm also does its job and I wake up 99% of the times it rings, I've experienced that 1% of times that it rings and I don't wake up, or rings and I disconnect without being conscious about it.\nThat's where your bf could have came in, and wake you up.\n\nI don't know if you communicated with him on the situation of setting up the alarm and what you needed to do, but that is a good step to bring you guys to the same page on a next occasion, whether with this or any future one. \n\nGood luck.", "Wonder if the friend fancies the boyfriend, can't see why else they would side with him. It was an important event, bf knew op wanted to prepare, he would have seen op was not awake when he turned off the alarm. He did it on purpose. Control. NTA", "She could walk away. She\u2019s not staying in their room she doesn\u2019t.  share their home. She could have turned around and left while they were fighting.", "Agree! Wrong to turn off the alarm. Never interfere with someone\u2019s agency and their ability to make money.", "You have an excellent point here, maybe he turned it off because he wasn't actually in the bed anymore but in another one and didn't want her to wake up. The friend could be siding with the bf because he was with her instead. I mean what friend thinks it's ok to turn off an alarm and not wake the person up so that can be ready for their presentation? Someone may be projecting to cover their tracks.", "NTA!!! What your boyfriend did was horrible!!! And the fact that he is blaming you for his actions shows that he's a coward and a liar. He actively sabotaged you and then convinced you it was your own fault. This is not what a good guy does. You can't trust this person.", "'You must have been awake'\nYet he noticed he had to turn off your alarm.\n\nThe guy is an idiot. If you were awake you would have turned it off yourself.\n\nYour boyfriend is an asshole and an idiot.\n\nSurely he knew you needed to get up?", "NTA. \n\nI understand him getting annoyed that your alarm kept going off. What I don\u2019t understand is why he didn\u2019t make sure you were awake. It\u2019s obvious you weren\u2019t since the alarm didn\u2019t stop & kept going. His excuse that he thought you heard it since he did is asinine. Why wouldn\u2019t you turn it off if you did hear it?", "Esh.", "What?! Gurl you did nothing wrong there! He knew you had a presentation and turned your alarm off. He\u2019s a massive arsehole", "The alarm part is bad. Turning of someone's alarm and letting them oversleep is horrible, especially if you know they need to get up.\n\nThe part after - demanding her to apologize, and succeeding - is highly manipulative, and demonstrates a disturbing level of control. In that context there's *at least* a 50% chance that he intentionally deactivated the alarm before it went off.\n\nOP, I strongly recommend you lock your phone with a passcode, no fingerprint (easy to bypass when you sleep). Then please spend at least 2 hours reading everything you can find about abuse, cycle of abuse, and narcissism.", "SHE didn't hear the alarm. Should he have woke her, absolutely, but NOT his responsibility so tough for her. Get up when your alarm goes off!!!", "Why are you holding him responsible for her getting up?", "It\u2019s one thing if your alarm was repeatedly going off, and you kept hitting SNOOZE, but that\u2019s not what happened here. \n\nYour boyfriend was a major A H for turning off your alarm without waking you up.  \n\nHe wrongly ASSumed that you had to have heard it. \n\nNTA.", "Dump the boyfriend, dump the friend, and treat yourself better by associating with kinder, more empathic people.  \n\n\nNTA OP.  But the boyfriend and friend are AH's.", "Except she couldn't, because he turned the alarm off while she was still asleep.\n\n*He* doesn't need to wake her, but he damn sure can't interfere with her alarm waking her.", "He PREVENTED her from getting up. If he hadn't been with her, she would have gotten up.", "when i finished reading, i was thoroughly confused as to why she needed to apologize \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She should have woken up to her own alarm. Not depending on the boyfriend. He should NOT have touched her alarm."]}
