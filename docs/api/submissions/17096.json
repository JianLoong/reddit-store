We all flew there and stayed at the hotel for free. My boyfriend and I were the only ones in our year who decided to go because we had exams and homework due right before. The other students who went with us are in a different year.\n\nI ended up doing schoolwork until the last minute and didn't prepare my presentation for the conference in advance (though everyone else seemed to be in a similar boat). Once we got there, I found out that my talk was scheduled to be the first on the first morning of the conference. I worked on my presentation that evening and I was happy with the result, except that I wanted to practice saying it out loud 2-3 times and I wanted to remove stuff to fit the time limit. I thought I could do this in the morning, so I set my alarm a few hours before my talk and went to sleep.\n\nI wake up to my friend [20F] banging on the door. My talk is in five minutes, why am I not downstairs? I'm like oh no, my alarm didn't get off. My boyfriend says my alarm did get off and he turned it off. I jump into my clothes and run downstairs with my presentation, no makeup and hair tied behind my head in 2 seconds. I get there on time to take the stage (they wouldn't let you take the stage if you were late).\n\nI stumbled through an overlong presentation and got cut three quarters of the way through. I was doubly nervous because we were the only ones from a non-English-speaking country and university and it was my first time in an English-speaking crowd in an English-speaking country. I spoke rather slowly and then looked like I wasn't intelligent enough to prepare a presentation that's the right length.\n\nAfter my talk, I went back to my room, and I started crying. I told my boyfriend that he had no right to touch my alarm. The alarm was on my phone, the phone was on my side, he had to have gotten up, stopped my alarm, and gone back to sleep. He said the alarm was annoying so he turned it off. Then I was like \"then why didn't you wake me up?\". But he was adamant that the alarm was loud enough and if he heard it then I must have heard it too and it was my fault for not waking up. I was like \"you can't turn off someone's alarm\" and he was like \"you are crazy, I did nothing wrong\". He said I am a huge asshole, he did nothing wrong, he doesn't want to hear about it ever again, and he doesn't want to see me for the rest of the trip.\n\nMy friend was there for all of this. She stayed out of it, but when my boyfriend asked her who she sided with, she said she agreed with my boyfriend. We left and she suggested I spend the day with her to forget about it.\n\nThe next day, I wasn't emotional anymore, I accepted I did something wrong, I apologized to my friend, and once my boyfriend agreed to talk after the trip, I apologized to my boyfriend, said he was right, I was wrong.", "created_utc": 1683928111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fy61c/aita_for_reacting_poorly_when_my_boyfriend_turned/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn't give a shit about you.", "NTA. What did you apologise for exactly? For getting upset that his actions caused you a lot of stress and embarrassment? \nAnd has your friend got a crush on him?

You did nothing wrong and had no reason to apologise.", "NTA, girl you did not deserve that", "What the HELL am I reading? Of course you\u2019re NTA and your boyfriend is absolutely one. Huge betrayal of trust. There\u2019s no reason for him to have turned off your alarm when he knew you had a big important presentation the next day. That\u2019s a disgraceful act of sabotage and you should be so angry with him.

It's kind of infuriating for you to post something where your bf is SO CLEARLY the AH in the situation, but then you say that you were wrong, and *apologized to him,* etc. \n\nI'm a much lighter sleeper than my husband, who has had to give lots of talks and presentations at conferences all over the world, and if I jumped up and turned off his alarm *before he woke up,* and didn't ALSO make sure he was awake, that would be a horrible thing to do to him. He would be right to be very upset and would probably start to sleep in a separate room whenever he had something he had to get up for, if he couldn't count on me letting his alarm wake HIM up. \n\nYour friend is an AH also for agreeing with him.", "NTA only because your boyfriend didn't make sure he woke you up when the alarm was turned off.", "NTA. I can certainly understand why you were angry. \n\nI can also understand why your BF thought you must have heard the alarm. He was half asleep himself at the time. Why I don't understand is why he wasn't apologetic once he realized that you bumbled through your presentation and in fact, almost missed it entirely because of his action. This guy does not sound like a winner to me.", "NTA but you need to not let people walk all over you", "NTA. If my husband turned my alarm off at all without waking me up I would be SO mad.

He could have woken you up or at least tried to wake you up before switching it off. Would have been different if he kept trying with no luck, but that didn\u2019t happen.
