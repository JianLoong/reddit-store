However , she should tell you in advance so you can rearrange yourself and \"look decent\" in the photos she's taking . My mother is the same , she would take pic of me when eating( I used to be a mess and I would always have something on my hand / face), when speaking ( no comments) or when I was making weird face because i was very anxious with strangers around me . I would tell her that I hated the way I looked and needed to be warned about her taking pics so I could actually like the picture  or at least look at them without wanting to cry ( yes I was a really depressed child that already hated her looks).\nSo you should do the same , she doesn't mean any harm with those pics.", "My dad was a professional photographer for a  national newspaper long before digital when dark rooms, chemicals and expensive paper were required to turn film into photographs.

Most taken without our permission. \n\nMy son got a hold of those pictures and made 3 photo books out of  them (printed and bound) that showed the story of my dads life and family from the 1950\u2019s until 2023.

Or are they just pictures she wants to have of her child?\n\nThis is going to get me downvoted I know, but I'll say it anyway.  I feel that today too many people act like everyone needs \"consent\" for any action.  You were in public, right?  Well guess what, chances are you were photographed a number of times.  The restaurant probably had security cameras.  There may have been traffic cameras on the street.  Someone may have taken a picture with you in the background.  Ever go to an ATM?  Surprise, your picture was taken. All of those things are perfectly legal and valid.\n\nParents like to have pictures of their children.   Everything doesn't need to be perfectly curated to be what YOU like.  It sounds like your mom probably has very few pictures of you since you get pissy about it.\n\nIf she was posting it online, I'd agree with you.  If she had a plan to print it out and frame it in her home, I'd agree with you.  If she just wants a picture of you from a nice day you had together, that she can look at when she is having a bad day or thinking of you, you are overreacting.\n\nEdit:  In the comments it says they aren't going on social media.

A compromise could look like you letting her take a photo of you when you say \"I feel confident today, it's ok to take a photo right now\" or sharing selfies or photos with her that your friends take. Maybe say once a month you agree to have your photo taken. She wants to look at your photo, which is sweet, but she also needs help respecting your boundaries, it's not cool to rejoice about crossing them. I don't think her behavior is ok but it sounds like you're not communicating with her. Honestly this seems pretty low stakes, use it as a test case for establishing, communicating, and respecting boundaries.", "YTA.\n\nUnless your mother has a habit of popping around and taking candid photos of you in uncompromising situations, it's fine. According to you, you were in a public place anyways and the photo was for your mum's personal album ONLY. Chances are that multiple people out there have taken photos that include you somewhere in the background over the years.\n\nI rarely look good in photos either.

If its true, its true. No amount of denying or wilful ignorance will make my double chin disappear.\n\n2.

Not just the staged, posed photos you like but the candid ones which she can look back on to remind herself of the times she shared with you. Maybe just try to compromise, she can keep the photos but can't share them or post them anywhere. \n\nAlso, I guarantee you when you look back you won't think you look nearly as bad as you think you do now, because you are at the age of peak insecurity. I remember photos of myself that made me cry because I thought I looked so hideous when I was a teenager.

My mom is getting older these days too and, while I don\u2019t because again consent matters the most, I really do sometimes desperately want to just take photos of her to keep for the day she isn\u2019t around anymore.

Nobody needs your consent to take your photo when in a public place. You don't need to like other people\u2019s photos they do.

I get it, I have a similar attitude to yours even if it's not for exactly the same reason. I don't like seeing myself in photos so I don't like people taking them. And at the end of the day, I think it's up to the subject of the photo to consent whether the photo is being put on social media or not.\n\nThat said, as I've got older, I've realised more and more that my mother doesn't care how I look in the photos, like at all. She just wants something to look at and remember the times we've spent together. At your age, I assume you'll be moving out of your mother's house soon if you haven't already. She will miss the hell out of you and would like to have those photos to look at. The carefully posed photos you have of yourself aren't the same because your mother wasn't a part of the experience.\n\nYou do not owe your mother these photos, but please consider allowing her to take more photos.

A compromise can be made here though, you can figure out what angles looks good on you/ shows you in a way you want to be shown. \n\nI know the urge to photograph family to have an image of the person you love and the happy memories. But I always make sure they are satisfied with the photo.  \n\nI am guessing your mother wants to have photos to remember pre-transition you by, since she might be worrying that she is losing the you she knows and loves.
