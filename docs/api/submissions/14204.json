His mother broke your trust by telling people abt your pregnancy when you weren't ready. The part where he said he didn't know how to get you to listen sounds like he wants to control you through his mom. All in all it sounds like a pretty stressful situation for you. You are allowed to not want her in your life, you just can't make her not be in your boyfriends life. And if they're that close you will probably not get rid of her if you don't get rid of him. \nIf you want advice, maybe sit them both down and tell them that you will not tolerate this behaviour.

You only live once! \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to you to hold that over your head, it\u2019s also not fair to \u201cteam up\u201d against you. It should always be \u201cus against the problem\u201d\n\nI\u2019d recommend seeking therapy, losing a child is incredibly difficult on the mother.

I think this forum is a little too on board with dropping every relationship without trying to work it out, but in this case, get out before it\u2019s too late. Everything you ever do, he is going to filter through his mother. They spend hours on the phone every day. She\u2019s probably been running your relationship for a while.

They were already treating you like a child who couldn\u2019t possibly know what\u2019s best for you and your baby. Imagine if you got pregnant again. After baby is born, they would constantly be telling you how to be a mother, how you are doing it wrong, etc. That is not a life that seems happy.
