It started last October when I found out I was pregnant. I told my boyfriend not to tell anyone yet since until we get the ultrasounds for our baby. But we agreed to tell his mom as he insisted on it.\n\nA few days later, I met with my aunts and one of them said I shouldn\u2019t eat too much cause it would be hard to give birth when I get heavy. I was shocked because I haven\u2019t told anyone from my side of the family yet. I was devastated because I wanted to be the one to tell my family about my pregnancy when I was ready.\n\nI asked my boyfriend if he found it weird that my aunts already know about my pregnancy and he brushed it off like it was a normal thing by saying, \u201coh mom must have mentioned it to them, don\u2019t worry about it\u201d\n\nA few days later my boyfriend and I got into an arguement about a vacation I booked for us months prior to finding out. I told him that we should still go since the flights were already booked and we can\u2019t cancel or refund them. We can still go sight seeing at least before we get anchored down to the house with a baby. \n\nHe was strongly opposed to it and said that it\u2019s best we stayed home and that I rest. Later in the day, my boyfriend\u2019s mom calls me, to check in. I told her that everything was fine. There was a lull and she mentioned that \u201cit would be best that I stay home and rest until my baby is here and that I shouldn\u2019t be wasting money on useless trips\u201d I immediately wanted to to drop the call. I felt suffocated.\n\nI confronted my boyfriend about it when he came from work. He told me he didn\u2019t know how else to make me listen about not going to our trip and he told his mom that I was being stubborn. I told him that we didn\u2019t need anyone else\u2019s opinion on how to live our life and that he shouldn\u2019t be telling his mom private matters.\n\nThen that\u2019s where I began to notice that every little thing I do, his mom would give me \u201cmotherly advice\u201d, I got so stressed about it. And the later on I found out that during they days when my boyfriend is at work, he and his mom are on the phone for 2 to 3 hours, catching up (ALMOST DAILY, he has Wednesdays off and his mom doesn\u2019t call him when he\u2019s home)\n\nI lost the baby in January of this year. And his mom still had a lot to say about how we should have listened to her.\n\nSo, AITA for no longer wanting to put up with my boyfriend\u2019s mom?", "created_utc": 1680856881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12eeji7/aita_for_no_longer_wanting_to_put_up_with_my/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hope you're keeping ok?\n\nI'm sorry to say this, but your bf is going to be like this for the rest of your lives.

Consider seriously if you would be able to endure another pregnancy and raising a child in this environment. \nBecause it would not be different the next time around. It would probably be worse, because they will use your loss to wield as a weapon against you, and guilt trip you. \n\nYour BF's mom is already guilt tripping you for something that is decidedly *not* your fault, in no way, at all, ever. \nBut she frames it as if you not listening to her caused you to lose the pregnancy. Giant RED flag. \n\nWhat they are doing is highly manipulative. \nHe uses his mother to \"make you listen\". She lets him. They put pressure on you. He refers to you as \"stubborn\" when you stand by what you want and think. \n\nSeriously think about wanting to put up with this at all.

Because then you would be TA. Otherwise you are allowed to set a boundry.\n\nFrom what you've said i don't think you are TA. His mother broke your trust by telling people abt your pregnancy when you weren't ready. The part where he said he didn't know how to get you to listen sounds like he wants to control you through his mom. All in all it sounds like a pretty stressful situation for you. You are allowed to not want her in your life, you just can't make her not be in your boyfriends life. And if they're that close you will probably not get rid of her if you don't get rid of him. \nIf you want advice, maybe sit them both down and tell them that you will not tolerate this behaviour. You will not tolerate her telling people about your business and you will not tolerate her judgements about your life unless you ask. Set a clear boundry. And if that doesn't work, maybe your bf and you just aren't compatible.\n\nEdit for judgement: NTA", "NTA  I\u2018d be more upset about the bf, running to his mommy for help when he can\u2018t get you to listen to him. And telling people about your private life. \n\nYou should talk to him and make him understand that it is not okay when he gets his mom involved in your personal business.", "Definitely NTA, run.", "ESH\n\nHonestly this situation sounds very hard. I\u2019m very sorry to hear about the loss of your baby, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s so hard for you. I wish you peace in your heart and mind.\n\nAs far as the question goes? It sounds like they are very close, but honestly that\u2019s up to you to decide if it\u2019s okay or not. Daily phone calls for hours sounds a little extreme to me, but I never had the best relationship with my parents. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing to be close with his mom HOWEVER you should not feel suffocated by it.\n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s a lot going on, her help isn\u2019t the best, but she\u2019s genuinely trying. I thought that this post was about the vacation, which I would have recommended going on myself. You only live once! \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to you to hold that over your head, it\u2019s also not fair to \u201cteam up\u201d against you. It should always be \u201cus against the problem\u201d\n\nI\u2019d recommend seeking therapy, losing a child is incredibly difficult on the mother. The hormones go out of control, it can make everything more difficult, but having a safe place to talk will help you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
