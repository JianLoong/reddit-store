You get zero say in the custody agreement between the child's parents. \n\nIf you are unhappy with the custody agreement between the child's *legal* *guardians*, them that's just unfortunate for you.", "NTA, I completely see where you\u2019re coming from here, you have the best of intentions for this kid and your concern is honourable. It sounds like his mother is a source of chaos and instability in his life, your BF is not seeing the long term picture like you are and I empathize with and feel your frustration just reading about the situation. I don\u2019t get how people think you\u2019re the asshole when you\u2019re trying to help this child and looking out for his best interests while it seems your BF is done with the litigation/mediation process and just wants it to be over. \n\nI feel you, I validate you, and I see why you\u2019re frustrated, and it sounds like you have a good heart and genuine concern for this poor kid whose life has been turned upside down by his unstable and inconsistent mother. The downvotes and some of the \u201cYTA\u201d verdicts are tough love at best and cruel at worst given the nuances of the situation. The genuine concern you seem to have for the wellbeing of this child and the stability you are willing to provide are obvious.\n\nUnfortunately, I also see that as the GF, you have no legal say in this arrangement, and your BF and his ex are the only two people with rights here. The court process can be emotionally exhausting and extremely stressful, I have seen friends go through it. I see why your BF just wants it to be over, but I see your reasoning behind why his having full custody is far better for his son.\n\nYou sound like a kind, sensitive, compassionate person, not an asshole. My heart goes out to you and the feelings of helplessness you must be feeling. Sadly, you don\u2019t have a say, and I am so sorry, I really am. If you can\u2019t convince your boyfriend to look at the long term benefits of having full custody in a calm and reasoned way when he is relaxed and having a good day, there is nothing you can do but accept what he and his ex decide about their son. I get \u201ccourt exhaustion,\u201d it\u2019s so emotionally charged and difficult, and I wish I had a viable solution for you. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nYou have made it clear in the comments that you would ensure his son maintains contact with his mother if you got full custody, which further tells me you are sensitive to family bonds and are not trying to steal him away from his biological mother. As an adoptee who had no contact with my biological mother from birth until I tracked her down as a teen, I appreciate you placing importance on this. I feel like I missed out on not knowing her earlier.\n\nIf reasoning with your BF doesn\u2019t work, sadly your only option is to be a bystander to what the parents and courts decide. You can do your best to be a positive influence in the life of this teen in the time that you have him. I understand the absolute frustration you must feel, however your only options are to do your best with the situation you are presented with. Do the best you can to maintain your relationship and provide a stable home for the child in the time that you have him, or distance yourself from the heartbreak of the entire situation and leave for your own peace of mind.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not telling you to leave, that\u2019s your call, you know your relationship and your capabilities and emotional limits. If you are willing to take on the challenge for what you anticipate will be your new household and relationship reality for the split weekly custody, then do so. If you can\u2019t, no judgement sister, do what gives you the most meaning, peace and happiness in your life. In a situation where you have no legal say, you need to think about you and how you wish to proceed.\n\nI recommend talking to a therapist about this one on one to help you cope and decide what is ultimately best for ~you~ and your psychological wellbeing in the long term, because it sounds like you are thinking about everyone else but yourself here, and you\u2019re important too. I truly wish you the best, it\u2019s a difficult situation and my heart goes out to you.\n\nEdit: Clarity.

And also, a 14 year old starting to acting out is not that uncommon. \n\nAnyway, like the other redditor said, even if your intentions are good, it is not your place to comment on their decisions regarding their child. And even if you were to be his wife, there are some situations where you won't be able to parent your stepson if the parents do not agree to that. Even if you deem the mother unfit. That's for a court to decide.", "You can keep replying this but it doesn\u2019t change that YOU DONT GET A SAY IN THE AGREEMENT", "I understand you want consistency but I\u2019m saying if you love this boy let his parents hash it out.

We are in nc if that makes a difference. They say it doesnt matter because the agreement says she has sole legal and physical custody and he just has visitation. Even though shes been MIA for for 4 years", "She won't agree to rules or punishments\n She will not parent him. That's what's hard. He's essentially living on his own when he's with her and when he's with us he has rules, expectations, and routine. Going back and forth so much with her for such long periods throws him completely off", "I don't have to have a say but I feel he should listen to my concerns and try to see it from another point of view, not just from stressed parent overdrive. Thanks for the kind concern", "Thank you for being kind.  I just worry for both of them in the long term. That was my only point of the post", "Okay, great. You still have no legal rights. \n\nWhy are you arguing with someone who voted that you were not the asshole here?", "Just but a suggestion. Due to the obvious deterioration of his schooling and personal options that have really been detrimental to his development, you normally can file an emergency motion for custody. I believe some affidavits from teachers and coaches will be unbiased and be based on grade records and attendance before and after removal.\n\nAlso, doing drugs alone is a major issue that is interfering with his education. This is also a red flag for emergency removal. That could be a CPS issue, and that's the last thing anyone wants.\n\nJust suggestions because if your lawyer is not taking these circumstances into account right now, he is doing the child a disservice unless you failed to explain all of the issues you talked about.\n\nCustody is always decided based upon the best interest of the minor child.\n\nBottom line, though, unless your bf wants to do emergency custody or any of the other things, you probably should step back and let hum handle it.  I will say you genuinely seem to have your stepson's best interest at heart - not a pissing contest with her.", "Sorry, but you don't get to decide what happens in her household. If your bf wanted full custody, he should've gone after it a long time ago.     \n\nYou are not this child's parent. You're not even married to his father. You're not even *old enough* to be his parent. Stay out of it.", "She has her own parenting. One that I don't agree with and I don't implement with my kid but there are people with a very more lax parenting. To be honest, my parents never gave me boundaries or times to get home or rules. I acted out as every teen, made mistakes like evryone else, but learned very early to create my boundaries, to learn when is the right time to go home. My mom lived with rules all her life and didn't want that for me because it didn't work out for her. She hated it. I had no rules at all and, now that I'm a mother myself, I have a more routine and classical education with my own child. \n\nListen you're just his gf, you're young (yes, I saw your previous comments and remembered your previous post and the tremendous age gap) you don't have to put up with that if this situation makes you uncomfortable. You can still leave the relationship.\n\nThe fact is, we can discuss for the next 4 years about what we think will be good for that kid, it's still not our place to make decisions about him.
