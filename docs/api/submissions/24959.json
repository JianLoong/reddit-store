Just an hour ago I went to the store right up the street from us. This particular store just opened and when my husband and I first went I noticed the woman that ran the store was being very flirtatious with my husband. Giving him the \u201ceyes\u201d laughing at literally everything he said. Staring at him. I kept it to myself though because I didn\u2019t wanna seem jealous and insecure. My husband has been going to that store about 3 times a week weather it\u2019s for quick snacks or a beer. It always takes him longer than it should. But I never brought it up because I didn\u2019t want to make a fuss. So when I walked in the store that same woman poked her head up from behind the counter and gave me the most empathetic look I\u2019ve ever seen. She asked me \u201coh my goodness hi, how\u2019s your baby boy?\u201d I walked over to her smiling about to tell her about the weight gain and why he was there when she then told me that my husband was up there a few days ago (we were in the hospital at this time) saying that our son had a hole in his heart. Not knowing what to do I went along with it to avoid telling her that my husband is a damn liar. I was stuttering. Thinking why he would lie about something so serious. Wondering how that conversation Even started. I paid for my items and left. Was he trying to get sympathy from this woman? Attention? I called my husbands phone as soon as I got home and let him have it. He said I\u2019m being unreasonable and it wasn\u2019t like that. So AITA?\n\nUPDATE: We are currently arguing over text.
