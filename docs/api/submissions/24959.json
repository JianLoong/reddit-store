Secondly..... Something is not right, whether he will admit it of not", "NTA. I would have told her the truth. Your husband is busy with shady shit and you need to wake up. What a shitty thing to lie about too.", "Nta...and I'd have totally ratted him out to her. Hell, this might even be a deal breaker for me. Cause for one he lied about your sons health, for two he did it to gain sympathy from a woman that flirts with him all the time and he's trying to get in her pants. Nope.....I'd be done. Tell her she can have his lying ass.", "100% NTA. Your husband is a dirty lying cheat and you deserve so much better than his games. Get out before you get sucked in too much deeper", "Exactly. He keeps apologizing saying he\u2019ll never go to that store again but like that\u2019s not the damn point you literally lied about our sons health to get sympathy", "> setting up his little side-piece\n\nDon\u2019t gloss over this OP! \n\nYour husband is actively engaging with this woman, spending time with her, gaining her sympathy and interest.

Gaslight vibes.", "And telling you he'll never go to that store again is also a lie.", "Don't worry about lying for him, when he was using your child to try to pick up a woman. What reason did he have to flat out lie. It's either he's trying to kick her up, or something scarier like noticing he gets more attention with a sick kid... And that can lead to them making your kid sick.\n\nNta.", "As much as it makes me mad to think about that\u2019s what I was thinking too", "I forgot to mention the woman was being overly friendly. She kept complementing me and then she goes \u201cyeah he\u2019s always up here talking about-\u201c then she cut herself off like she was trying to hurry up and change what she was about to say and continued saying \u201che\u2019s always up here talking about you and y\u2019all\u2019s family\u201d this to me is a huge red flag."]}
