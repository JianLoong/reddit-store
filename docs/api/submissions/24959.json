They didn\u2019t find anything wrong but after 5 days and being placed on a higher calorie formula & noticing weight gain he was discharged . Just an hour ago I went to the store right up the street from us. This particular store just opened and when my husband and I first went I noticed the woman that ran the store was being very flirtatious with my husband. Giving him the \u201ceyes\u201d laughing at literally everything he said. Staring at him. I kept it to myself though because I didn\u2019t wanna seem jealous and insecure. My husband has been going to that store about 3 times a week weather it\u2019s for quick snacks or a beer. It always takes him longer than it should. But I never brought it up because I didn\u2019t want to make a fuss. So when I walked in the store that same woman poked her head up from behind the counter and gave me the most empathetic look I\u2019ve ever seen. She asked me \u201coh my goodness hi, how\u2019s your baby boy?\u201d I walked over to her smiling about to tell her about the weight gain and why he was there when she then told me that my husband was up there a few days ago (we were in the hospital at this time) saying that our son had a hole in his heart. Not knowing what to do I went along with it to avoid telling her that my husband is a damn liar. I was stuttering. Thinking why he would lie about something so serious. Wondering how that conversation Even started. I paid for my items and left. Was he trying to get sympathy from this woman? Attention? I called my husbands phone as soon as I got home and let him have it. He said I\u2019m being unreasonable and it wasn\u2019t like that. So AITA?\n\nUPDATE: We are currently arguing over text. He\u2019s at work right now and gets off tonight so I\u2019ll update you guys when he gets home and what lies he tries to spin. He keeps saying \u201cshe misunderstood my words.\u201d This woman doesn\u2019t know anything about me she has no reason to lie. He\u2019s pissing me off. I\u2019m thinking about leaving. This is not just him flirting with a woman or him liking instagram pictures you lied about ours sons health to get sympathy. I think I\u2019m done. I want to separate.\n\nUPDATE 2: so the dick is home and we definitely argued. I know when my husband is lying his eyes dart back and forth a lot and that\u2019s exactly what he was doing along with shaky breathing. He kept trying to lie to me and tell me that that\u2019s not what he said. Claiming he said \u201cI said he has a hole in his heart because I have a hole in mine because he\u2019s in the hospital\u201d lord I wanted to smack him. I just stared at him and walked off. I came back and told him if you don\u2019t tell me the truth right now I\u2019m leaving. Getting a divorce and I\u2019m taking our kids. He started to cry and beg me not to. Then he finally told the truth. He told me exactly what the woman told me. I just shook my head and told him to get out. He\u2019s packed his stuff right now and gone to his dads house. Thank you everyone who supported me on this post. I am gonna take some time away from my husband until I figure out what I want but right now I\u2019m considering getting a divorce.

But your son was literally in the hospital, he was ltierally sick and instead of focusing on the son he's going wow, how can I exploit this to hit on this woman I'm attracted to.\n\nDegenerate doesn't even begin to cover it.\n\nIt would also immediately make me believe this is entirely normal behaviour for him when he's not around you and if he's constantly hitting on women, there is likely a reason for that.", "I think there are far bigger issues going on in this relationship than what this post is stating", "what kind of absolute tool lies about their child having a medical condition to get nookie?", "NTA. You better demand couples therapy asap.", "She was thinking about her child, she can love him and still leave him. He had no right to lie about something so serious about his child to some random lady at a corner-store. I'm sure she loves him, they were together for 6 years. But she's putting her child first and that's a damn-good mama! I'd divorce him too. Having a hole in your heart is very dangerous--my older brother has a hole in his heart do to a valve never closing. It is dangerous, and not okay to lie about to ANYONE. She's being a good mom, and more power to her.", "I'm not sure he thinks too little of his son, just too much about his dick.", "Doubt he said they were polly. Probably was sleeping or trying to sleep with the woman at the store though.\n\nOtherwise why all the bullshit? If hed gotten confused at the doctor, which is pretty normal, not everyone understands medical jargon and medical staff arent always good at translating it into something everyone can understand. If that were the case though he wouldnt have doubled down on the lie and played dumb.", "Manifestation is based on the theory of quantum physics that everything in the universe is energy. Positive and negative. Ever hear of the law of attraction? Murphy\u2019s law? \n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cmagic\u201d.", "Sounds like a borderline form of Munchausen by proxy.", "Yeah I checked their previous posts as well and husband sounds like an absolute prick.", "Absolutely. I don't see any other motivation for this other than to garner sympathy from this woman in order to get closer to her and possibly sleep with her.", "It happened to me.  It was awful.  I really feel for OP.\n\nFortunately I was able to buy a new mirror.", "That we could all be so fortunate...", "Somewhat of a sidenote, but mysterious failure to thrive is frequently connected to cases of Munchausen's by proxy. Lying about your son's health to that degree also makes me think Munchausen's by proxy... Something to be very wary of from your husband (or ex-husband) moving forward.", "Failure to thrive? Wtf?", "Depending on what that actually is that can be a very minor condition \n\nFor instance ALL babies have a hole in the hard that is necessary during pregnancy and closes up later in the first two years.\n\nAnd as long as you aren't a Tech Diver you usually don't give a single fuck about it.\n\nGoogle PFO", "YTA", "ok I'm sorry op but YTA \n\nI've worked as a clerk and the entire job is being nice to people all day, if you are cute and you do this people will think you are flirting with their men, please understand that this clerk is not flirting with your man, she is being nice because that's her job.\n\nshe was nice to you too, she asked about your baby, I bet she asks your husband about how you are too, (possibly because she got vibes about how you feel and wants to remind him that he's married) she sounds like a nice person who works in customer service. not a homewrecker. I hope you can be friends with her.\n\nyour husband is a dingbat, he made a stupid decision to lie for no reason, but I do not believe that this means he is a cheater, I think this means that he is a dum dum who bothers cashiers. we get those all day long, they are annoying, you have to ask them about their baby and their wife and then they go home.\n\nI hope you can repair things with your husband, (or break up with him, like either way solves your problems) but like, I do think this may not be everything you think it is.", "How is that gonna work? He hooks up with this chick and it works out\u2026 isn\u2019t she gonna find out? And be mad he lied to her?", "Woah, that\u2019s actually scary.", "He sounds like a possible malignant narcissist. Very scary!", "He sounds like a malignant narcissist. If so, she needs to run so fast not even light can catch her!", "Then thats fuckin' weird. NTA.", "And also a gross over exaggeration. No \u201cI\u2019ll deal with the root of this problem\u201d just \u201cI\u2019ll avoid that specific woman, she\u2019s the problem!\u201d", "Was in doubt until the egg & garage part. He's crafty, but we're all in danger now, because this might go wrong, in which case the gravity could come down off the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, then not just the people in OPs town, but all of us will be facing a real War of the Worlds scenario. Just.... be cautious. That's all I'm saying. I don't like this. Everyone, keep your eyes on the sky all weekend, alright? I don't like this at all."]}
