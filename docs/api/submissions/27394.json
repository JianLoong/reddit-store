His grades were also average at best. \n\nMy niece is the opposite. She is extremely smart and likes doing a lot of activities and she is extremely good at some of them. Her soccer team wins many games and she can play guitar very well.\n\nSo naturally whenever we gather everyone likes to talk about her. My nephew is very jealous of his sister and he makes sure everyone knows this.\n\nEvery time we talk about my niece he likes to whine about how she is our golden child and we only talk about her.\n\nYesterday it happened again, we were talking about the new song that my niece learned to play and we were admiring her. My nephew started whinning. That's when I decided I've had enough. I told him if he wants people to talk about him then he needs to actually do something otherwise what does he expect? That we would talk about how good he plays video games? I told him that he is average and ordinary and he hasn't done anything that we would be proud of.\n\nI know I was a bit harsh but I think he needed to hear it however he called us all a bunch of jerks and left", "created_utc": 1695367278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p3rs5/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_nephew/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA.", "YTA. Most people are average and ordinary, hence the definitions of the words. You could have made the same point without being insulting. You could have assured him that you are proud of him, but the conversation was about sis's actions.", "YTA. Did it ever occur to any of you that the world doesn't revolve around your niece and the things that she does? If not, you all need to get a clue. As there is only so many times that sort of subject matter can be discussed before enough is enough.\n\nAnd trust me, I know. I have 16 nieces and nephews of various ages. Each one is completely different from each other. All with their own accomplishments and failures. When someone does something good/nice, I say good job and move on. I don't focus on just one child during every single conversation. As all that does is breed resentment and jealousy. Which has already happened in your family thanks to the way you're all acting. You're all just too ignorant to acknowledge your fault in this mess.", "> I told him that he is average and ordinary and he hasn't done anything that we would be proud of.\n\nYTA. You had me up until right here. That's especially harsh. Just because he hasn't done something exceptional doesn't mean he's done nothing to be proud of.", "YTA How about trying to play games with him, or chat about what games he is doing? Not to be proud of him for anything? How about being happy he is healthy and not doing drugs, he hasn't gotten anyone pregnant and is marrying early, and he even passed his schooling? (Based all this on the fact you didn't whine about it) Many people can't do these things but he managed it. It's small, but big for some people and is deserving of pride as anything else! You are being an elitist snob!", "YTA\n\nPeople don't need to do anything to be deserving of love and respect imo. Telling him he hasn't done anything you would be proud of is really harsh and probably not even true (like really, not once in his life did he do a kind thing or a clever thing or something that made you even a little proud?). You basically told him that he amounts to nothing as a person. That won't encourage him to do better, it will probably just cause him to want to give up on trying.", "YTA - If you were to speak to your nephew I guarantee you will realize he also has skills and interests you could talk about, you just don't want to make the effort", "YTA There is nothing wrong with being average.  MOST people are.\n\nYou nephew was 100% correct in what he said.\n\nYou post drips with disdain for your nephew.\n\nWe all have the choice in this life to be kind or to be right.  I would rather be kind.\n\nYou obviously choose differently.", "Not sure what you expect, but yeah YTA. Tons of ways to teach a lesson and you went for one of the roughest. Maybe he will hear you or maybe he'll just decide he doesn't like you one bit.", ">I told him that he is average and ordinary and he hasn't done anything that we would be proud of.\n\nThat is so mean and rude to tell anyone, let alone your own nephew. Most people in this world are average. Among bunch of musicians even your niece is average. Not saying you should stop praising your niece or something but it's just so weird you shame him for being average. Truly there's nothing he can be appreciated or praised for??? \n\nYTA. There were better ways to go about it than being an *average* b.", "YTA. Way to show who the golden child is to the entire family. You were very mean and harsh. So he\u2019s average, doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t got feelings and may want to be included in talks that aren\u2019t just about admiring his perfect sister.", "What a nasty person you are. YTA", "YTA. Every child has a right to be acknowledged. We are not all accomplished in a lot of things.\n\nIt's all right to be 'average' . You show a lot of favouritism I hurt for your nephew.\n\nMy God, you pissed me off. I teach kids who are not considered 'smart with their brain'. These kids are amazing in producing a lot of things.  \nWhy would a person need to be accomplished in things to be acknowledged and talked about?", "Yta. So what if he doesnt fit your mold of what constitutes commendable behaviour?\n\nThat gaming experience could lead them down the path of software development, one day they could be the next steve jobs.  your disinterested in their hobbies and hold the belief said hobbies are devoid of value, believe what you want on that front, but dont take that to mean your nephew lacks value and isnt worth engaging with.\n\nThe most common base response people have to that treatment results in the development of a \"why even try\" mentality, not the \"I'll prove them wrong\" mentality people like to believe they're creating by degrading the actions of others.", "YTA", "Info: What have you done that's above ordinary and average?", "Alright. I\u2019m going to say it. I have an experience where my family doesn\u2019t realize talent other than sports, academics and barely music. Music is not even really considered a talent (keeping in mind I\u2019m rather good with the piano), just a side note. This is exclusively my fathers side of the family. I graduated high school last year and at the party my grandmother (moms side) surprised me with my own photo, of the cemetery on Memorial Day in the town my aunt (dads side) lived and my aunt never knew I had that talent. Why? My parents and relatives (on dads side) always compared me to my cousins. My father died before he could put an end to it so he never knew about the talent but he hated this habit of his side of the family, and so I never told his side of the talent. He may feel you don\u2019t value him or even know him at all, and my fathers side of the family was particularly ashamed of their judgmental behavior all these years because \u201coh, he\u2019s not just some lazy burnout, he has talent\u201d and my mothers side, the less judgmental side, knew of this talent for years. It\u2019s completely a matter of how you treat people sometimes. I mean, I\u2019m a little younger than your nephew, but I can remember being him. YTA", "YTA. Quite frankly the constant fawning over one sibling over the other which has gone on far longer than the guy has been 20, seems like a massive issue of neglect. Not only that, the now 14 year old will plateau, she won\u2019t get better and the constant pressure of having to please a bunch of assholes for conditional love will break her. Congrats you have two people set up for failure.\n\nYou stink and so do the parents.", "NTA.  This was not harsh nor uncalled for.  If your nephew were a quiet guy that just liked doing what he does and was happy for his sister's accomplishments then your comments would have been terrible.  But if he were like that, you wouldn't have said any of this in the first place.  To be a 20 year old man complaining about a 14 year old girl getting attention for her hard work and accomplishments in front of her no less is pathetic.  You gave him the kick in the butt he needs.  I hope others take your lead!", "Your nephew sounds like he has a lot of growing up to do. He's an adult jealous of a child. On the other hand, you could've been more tactful. \n\nAs others have already said here. Everyone is deserving of love and respect, regardless of whether you're above average or not.\n\nESH.", "Nephew is 20yo and whines about being compared to his 14yo sister? He needed to hear that wake up call. Unless there are any other ND factors at play, you're definitely NTA. Better off hearing that from family than strangers.", "Guess I'm going against the grain here, but NTA.  You were harsh but not wrong.  He's a grown man complaining about his 14 yo sister getting attention.  All the comments condemning you are purposely misinterpreting what you said to justify their position.  You never said he was undeserving of love.  All you said was people talk about his sister's achievements because she has achievements, and if he wants people to talk about his achievements, then he needs to achieve something.  Nice words are like pebbles.  If you want to break through someone's wall of self deception, you need to fire a harsh canon ball.", "NTA. He needs a wake up call.", "YTA, but so is your nephew. Maybe he needed a wake-up call and he seems mean to his sister, but you did it in awful way and it's also not his fault he doesn't have a lot of, or even any, talents. It's OK to be avarage, you shouldn't shame him for that, but he shouldn't act this way when his sister is performing or talking about her success. However, talking only about her is also terrible and the whole family shows favourism towards your niece.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
