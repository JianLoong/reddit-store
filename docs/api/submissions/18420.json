But after they were on, it was *awful*. It felt like a really weird mix of too tight and painful when I tried to use my hands for anything, and I was just constantly aware of them in a way I'm normally not.\n \nIt stressed me out so badly I went home and soaked them in acetone right away. I can't really describe it very well, haha! I've noticed that I also don't do well with press on fake nails as well, so all I can do is nail polish without going insane.\n\nEdit: I just realized you said people with sensory issues can have issues with acrylics and now I wonder if that's what it was for me.

Most of the time I don't even bother with my fingernails because I'm so bad about ruining my manicures. The reason I do gel on my toenails is because I like to keep them polished.

If fake nails are doing that much damage to your natural nails, get a refund. If you get the right nail tech, no damage is done- so I'm struggling to see why so many people say they're damaging.", "Have you tried gummies that help strengthen your nails, or nail serums?", "You could try semi cured gel strips!

If you try a brand and it doesn\u2019t work for you, it\u2019s likely another brand will. I personally started with and continue to use dashing diva glaze, pretty nails closet (make sure they\u2019re semi cured gel and not regular polish strips - they sell both) and nailog. BFF really likes Danii and toni (sp?) and ohora. I picked up a dashing diva starter kit on sale at either cvs or ulta, can\u2019t remember which. For remover I use unisolv (a bandage adhesive remover) and floss picks."]}
