The vegetarian should have had priority with that dish. It wouldn\u2019t take a lot of time to prep a single serve dish of vegetarian lasagne and serve a larger \u201csharing dish\u201d for everyone else. \n\nThis may be my view because my family are rather particular about how to host a dinner party. I\u2019ve never been to one in my family or friend circle where the person/people with particular dietary requirements don\u2019t have a separate single serve to ensure that they actually do get enough before anyone helps themselves.

If I know it is going to be a long evening I will typically make myself something as a \"main\" at home and eat it beforehand. \n\nIt was not remotely disrespectful, and you asked if you could get her something else and she declined.

Dishes were available to her; not your fault she didn't want to eat them. That is purely her problem and for her to claim you somehow discriminated against her is idiotic to say the least.\n\nShe can choose to be upset - you're not required to acknowledge or even validate her feelings. Her not wanting to eat the food is one thing; to claim you didn't try to accommodate her is an outright lie on her part.\n\nTell her that you're sorry she didn't want to eat any of the dishes you made so you won't bother wasting time making them in the future.
