For your next dinner party, tell her, \u201cOut of a sincere wish to respect and avoid offending your dietary sensibilities, you are cordially invited to stay home.\u201d", "Nope. Being a good host means having proper food for your vegetarian guest - it does not mean you can only serve vegetarian food! I say this as a long time vegetarian. NTA", "Info: were all the roast vegetables etc cooked traditionally, as in the same roasting pan the bird was? Was the gravey made traditionally using the fat and run off from the bird? What/were there vegetarian dishes available? More than just a skoty salad.\n\nEdit: nevermind, I see in the comments there was more than enough vegetarian options including lasagna \ud83e\udd24\n\nOP NTA, just like religious people don't get to dictate what *other people* do based on their religion, nor do vegetarians/vegans/keto/anything else.", "YTA. The deal with hospitality is you meet people where they are, not where you are or where you wish they were. You invite a Jewish friend to dinner, you don't have pork. You invite a vegetarian, you don't have both a main course of meat AND no alternative for the vegetarian. If you cannot observe that simple rule of hospitality, don't invite a vegetarian or a Jew to dinner.", "NTA - One person's preferences do not get to dictate things for an entire group.\n\nIt reminds me of my mom's story about a group of ladies she used to work with who would go out to dinner together every so often. Only one woman was a smoker; the other six or so were not. But because of the smoker, who was very vocal, and the other women not wanting to make a huge thing, they would always have to eat in the restaurant's smoking section (this was back in the '80s). Apparently it did not cross the smoker's mind that being in the minority might mean the whole world did not cater to her wants.", "Kinda makes you wonder...does this person go storming into grocery stores and demanding they stop selling meat? That too would be insensitive and disrespectful to her beliefs.", "It sounds to me like before giving up on the friendship, OP might have one last conversation with guest to learn exactly how she thinks the complete interaction should have gone, starting with the invitation. Was her being a vegetarian discussed or were potentially useful facts not brought up?\n\nWhen I have a dinner party, I always ask guests if they have food sensitivities I need to know about. If I am taking the trouble to cook a dinner for guests I want everyone to feel honored and not left out.\n\nOf course, I really love to cook. I know there are people who have one dish they prepare for dinner parties and they never change (which is too bad).", "If someone invites me to dinner at their table, I assume they will honor the way I eat. If you invite someone you know can't eat a significant part of what you're serving, why did you invite them? And how do you define hospitality if you invite someone for a meal, then do not serve them food  they can eat?  Being a good just or hostess does not mean hectoring someone about their life choices, it means accepting how they are.", "Ignoring the guest's life choices is no way to treat a guest. Why was that guest invited if the host had no intention of serving her a complete meal of food she could eat?", "Your niece is old enough for what?", "A multibean salad us a great option !", "That did make me laugh but my friends are not all bad, I promise!\n\nWe moved about seven years ago and became part of a new group of friends. At the time, three people were vegetarian. Over the past seven years, that number has more than tripled and many others have drastically reduced their meat consumption.\n\nIt's not a crusade, it's just that the veggie cooks have to be a bit more imaginative with getting flavour into what they're cooking and the carnivores began to realise that they liked what they were eating.\n\nThe people I'm talking about are people with whom we have a more casual relationship and who have no great cooking skills. It doesn't happen often now though\n\nI have to say, however, that I would welcome an invite to dinner at your house. That menu sounds amazing. A shame we're on different continents!", "Hurray for you! You understand hospitality. And yeah, mashed potatoes is one dish that really doesn't translate.\n\nI have found that when it comes to alternative diets, you don't get great results taking the basic American diet and trying to find substitutes. It's much more helpful to study how the cuisine's parts interact and being guided by that.", "Mushrooms, onions, carrots and celery is my best combination.", "https://jamiegeller.com/.amp/recipes/cranberry-quinoa-stuffed-zucchini/\n\nI first made them for Thanksgiving, because the cranberry and the fact that they're squash (even if it's summer squash) felt \"fall.\" They were such a hit that I now make them for Passover as well.", "Me too, but now there are so many different alternative milks that I haven't used soy milk for years!", "Thank you for the recipe, I am drooling \ud83e\udd24, definitely making it!"]}
