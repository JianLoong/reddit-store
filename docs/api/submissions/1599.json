He seems like a nice guy.  However my kids have told her that they want to talk to me about how I'm being irresponsible with my money.  That I should be saving for my retirement.  That I am going to go through all my money and there won't be any inheritance.  LoL. My parents aren't going to leave me dick.

He sold his house to his kid and moved to Guatamala.  His costs are super low and he travels to visit about 1-2 times a year.  He set aside funds for his grandkid, but other than that he plans to live out his days in the warmth and culture of Guatamala.  NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. You seem to have retirement squared away. Their inheritance is what you want to leave them, which is everything or nothing. You're enjoying your life and not infringing on them. You got them through college, which is a lot more than many people get. Many people's support ends at HS graduation.\n\nI would be more diplomatic about the convo even if they are being greedy assholes.", "I encourage my parents to take ski holidays (spend kids inheritance).\n\nThey worked hard for their money and deserve to enjoy their retirement.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You have done more than enough I think. They need to start believing in their abilities to better their lives financially.", "NTA at all.  You've done more than most parents financially.  Your kids should be happy that you're enjoying your life", "I aspire to be you.", "NTA. I would be glad if my mom burned through all her savings living her best life - it is her money and she deserves to have a nice retirement after a life full of work. \nI hope your kids are coming around again. If not, I would not leave them a dime if I were you. But that\u2019s just petty me.", "NTA, and I love your system.  I guess it relies on being near a cheaper warmer country like Mexico... Can't see how I can make it work for me :(", "Inheritance is a weird idea to me, help your children get started in life obv but expecting money after a relative dies seems so morbid. You would hope you'd given your children enough support and taught them life skills at the start that they wouldn't be so entitled as to assume they're getting a payout. It should be a choice rather than  an expectation", "Your life? My dream!! NTA but your kids are!", "NTA. Sounds to me like you\u2019re living the dream!", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe your adult kids any money. You did everything for them (education, a good amount of money to startup in life), that's quite a lot. Now you are enjoying life, and that is absolutely fine.\n\nAnd to tell you the truth, kids thinking of \"inheritance\" money after their parents die... is really weird and shitty.", "NTA - You've provided for your kids, and now you're getting to live your best life!", "NTA but y.w.b.t.a if you talk to them and call them greedy little shits. Tell them that you understand their point but money should not be their main priority. Tell them that you care about them but that they don\u2019t understand your full life. Tell them that their behaviour is uncalled for and that you are a grown adult who knows how to save your money. That by living your lifestyle, you are actually saving money. Just go about it in a good manner and if they overreact, leave because ultimately it\u2019s your choice.", "They\u2019re counting their inheritance before you\u2019ve even died, I would say they\u2019re the assholes. Live your life and whatever is left over is a gift, it\u2019s not a right. I inherited debt, but that\u2019s just how life goes sometimes. The time I had with my parents matter more than what I could have been given", "NTA, they seem to be more concerned about inheritance than about having to support you after you retire.", "NTA and wow\u2026 when you meet up with your kids, please show up with a few coffin catalogues and maybe the brochure for the burial at sea people. Tell you kids to start saving now to pay up for your funeral as you will continue to spent YOUR money as you see fit. \n\nNew flash to them - it is YOUR money!  The level of entitlement is ludicrous. They are planning on your inheritance while you clearly have plenty of life in you. Keep on living!  Be bold and be you!", "NTA.   I wouldnt tell the kids off, instead  make your will, exclude and  give the left over money to some one you like.  \nAlso check at the dinner who is pushes the hardest for inheritance and see who is the ringleader, give that person your shoes since so desperately wants be in them.", "NTA - you have supported them long enough. It is \u201cyour\u201d money not \u201ctheir\u201d inheritance. \nAnd you are making better financial decisions by not renting a property. \nI would put them in their place.

You're definitely nta! \nIf you had a huge estate in the family you were burning through that would be different but you're living your best life, maybe the kids are jealous?\n\nAnyway, have a great one I know I'm a bit jealous. ;)", "NTA \nThey're taking about inheritance? Don't they plan on earning anything?\nYou save your money so you can enjoy their life post retirement! You've done your duty.", "NTA. You earned it, you provided, now do what makes you happy. Just make sure you don't burn through your cash and have to rely on your children before you die. Ill health can hit us at any time, no guarantee you can stay healthy and active until the end.", "NTA I think you've proven that you are in fact responsible with your money by the great start in life that you have provided for your children. Also, your two week \"holiday\" every moth actually makes great sense when you compare it to renting an apartment. Maybe if you demonstrate the logic to them the will better understand. Ultimately, whatever you choose to do with the money you earn is your business. I think they are probably jumping to conclusions that you're blowing all your paycheck on your two week adventure every month and not saving for retirement at the same time", "NTA.  It's none of their concern how you spend your money, and they are damn ballsy if they expect you to live like a pauper for the rest of your life so they can squeeze more money out of you after death.  \n\nSince I'm petty, if I were you, I'd tell those little leeches that my will has any remaining assets being donated to charity upon my death.", "NTA. It's not \"their inheritance\", it's *your money*.\n\nWhen the confrontation happens explain that you understand their concern for your welfare but that you have a retirement plan and won't be a burden. And that they don't have to worry about an inheritance because you've decided to leave whatever is left to charity.\n\nAnything other than acceptance that you've got a plan (and maybe promises that you'll be on your own financially if it goes wrong) is selfish on their behalf.", "NTA - Keep living your best life. \n\nMy dad was obsessed with leaving an inheritance to my sisters and me, until we sat him down and told him that when the day comes and he is no longer with us, we would give the entire inheritance and more just to spend one more day with him.\n\nAnd I hope when my time comes, I arrive late, in love and a little in debt. \n(a rewrite of the quote from Atticus: \"I Hope To Arrive to My Death Late, In Love & a Little Drunk\")", "NTA- you have it exactly right. the fact that they think you \\*owe\\* them more than the life you've already helped give them blows my dang mind. You gave them each $20k! \\*\\*\\*$20K!!!\\*\\*\\* With no strings attached!!! I am honest to goodness flabbergasted!", "NTA", "NTA youve already given them a handsome amount of money to start with. The 20k now is also way more valuable as it gives them more opportunities compared to in 20-30 years when youll eventually pass, and theyve had the opportunity to make their own money. \n\nAlso, the most important point... ITS NOT THEIR INHERITANCE YET.", "You're NTA as long ad you have enough to retire and cover any emergencies.\n\nMy mother dosnt spend anything on herself as she is saving it for me and my brother,  I would much rather she had a fun, happy retirement than worry about saving a few dollars.\n\nYou've earned your money, your free to spend it as you wish.", "NTA your money do as you wish. If they had the nerve to bring it up to me I\u2019d tell them not to worry not their problem. I agree that paying for a place that you only use half the time is a waste. Enjoy your life they are adults and should not be counting on an inheritance.", "NTA \n\nYou did your job as a parent supporting your kids till they are able to support themselves. Anything after that is gravy. \n\nThey should be thanking your for the $20,000. What you do with the rest of your money is up to you. Even if you wanted to leave all your money to your dog when you die, that is totally acceptable. I\u2019m sorry to say, but your kids sound a little spoiled.", "Your life sounds amazing. You did what you could for your kids and it sounds like you and your ex raised them well. Your laid back attitude will serve you well and your kids would be well served by a lesson on gratitude!", "NTA\n\nThe kids are coming off as entitled brats.", "NTA because you sound like you've thought this through.\n\nDo they get it though? Have you explained to them the same as you have on this post that you're not digging a hole for yourself?\n\nAs for the inheritance - wait for them to bring it up. If the conversation doesn't venture into 'what about us?' territory don't take it there yourself. Force them to say that's what their motive in taking to you is all about.\n\nThen, if they accept what you have to say there's been no drama.", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them an inheritance. Just because it\u2019s what\u2019s done more often than not, it\u2019s not an actual rule. I think what you are doing is great.  Love your life, spend your money how you want. Your kids are educated and have jobs. It\u2019s time for them to love their own lives and take care of themselves. They shouldn\u2019t be anticipating your death because they can get a cheque.", "NTA\n\nIf they truly want to discuss your retirement, that seems like it could be reasonable. If, as you\u2019ve said, they also want to discuss their inheritance, they\u2019re a bunch of selfish jerks.\n\nI\u2019m mid 50s, and my parents are mid 70s. They\u2019ve each separately mentioned my inheritance. I\u2019ve told them both to live life how they want to. If there\u2019s enough left to cover funeral expenses and settle any final matters, bonus.", "NTA. There\u2019s something really wrong with them if they\u2019re trying to force you to limit your life because they want your money. The only reasons they\u2019d have to talk to you about this would be if you were currently taking money from them or failing to save for yourself and planning to live off of them in retirement, neither of which is the case.", "Right?! This is dreams!\n\nNTA time to pull out your dad\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d until they stop bugging you about spending your money.", "I was planning on being more diplomatic. Maybe.", "Nah even if op said that op wouldn't be the ah sounds like the only reason they brought it up is for themselves bc they want an inheritance", "LoL", "it sounds like OP \\*has\\* thought about their own future.", "How do you mean?", "Seriously. Check into the system that Ecuador has in place for retirees from Europe and North America. It is amazing.", ">I think they are probably jumping to conclusions that you're blowing all your paycheck on your two week adventure every month and not saving for retirement at the same time\n\nI did wonder how much of this talk is going to be based on a simple lack of understanding on their part.", "Or a massive tip to the hotel staff", "Realistically my pension will cover the cost of a retirement home in a cheap city in North America.  I am not going to burden anyone.", "This! \ud83d\ude4c I want to see their faces when he tells them he is leaving everything to charity. \ud83d\ude02", "My ex and I are good at saving.", ">My mother dosnt spend anything on herself as she is saving it for me and my brother\n\nI feel this.\n\nMy parents are considering spending \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s on something that will improve their quality of life substanically, but felt the need to run it past us kids first as they said it would make a big dent in any inheritance. IMO if anyone had an objection to it they don't deserve any inheritance at all. I told them to just do it and let people know after if they need to at all.", "As someone who is 34 and has 2 living parents...I CANNOT imagine worrying about them spending my inheritance. In all honesty I don't really think about what they will leave me when they die. I worry more about how incredibly broken I will be when they die. If I had a choice between $1,000,000 or my parents living forever, I would choose my parents living forever in a heartbeat. Like wtf. You are NTA. And I like the idea of you telling them you have a plan and it involves giving anything you have left to charity. Screw them.", "No no. Greedy little shits is exactly right. Maybe add entitled in there as well. \n\nYou could always end it with pointing out that whatever you night have left will be donated to a shelter for cats or basket weaving school.", "Well,  that is what I would have done  if my kids where like this.  Mine arent, they have told they rather be loved then rich when I."]}
