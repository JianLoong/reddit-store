Our moms were close and even after they eventually gravitated apart Jane and I still remained best friends until last week. \n\nI\u2019ve always been \u201cbig boned\u201d, since childhood I was the funny friend that lightened the mood with humor and positivity. And truthfully, none of my friends ever commented on my weight ever, even Jane. She usually made sure I was comfortable without ever explicitly pointing it out and during my insecure teen years I really appreciated that. Now that I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve learned to love who I am and I feel comfortable in my body. \n\nSince we were teens we always planned our weddings, talked about being each others bridesmaids, shared Pinterest boards.. the whole deal.. and that continued until we hit our early twenties. In fact, she asked me to be a bridesmaid as soon as she got engaged with a cute care package. However last week after I sent her my measurements for our dresses (she\u2019s having them custom made) she called me and said that b/c of costs she was cutting down the number of her bridesmaids to just her sisters. Which I totally understood! A couple days later, our mutual friend Liz sent me her final pick for her dress and asked me which color I had chosen. Confused I told her we had been dropped from the wedding party for not being immediate family, I called her because she is that one friend that responds to texts 2 weeks later and I assumed she just never saw Jane\u2019s message.  Liz immediately started up the group chat to confirm that we had been dropped and that\u2019s when I got a private message from Jane saying that she had only dropped me because she didn\u2019t think \u201cthe style she chose for everyone suited me\u201d and the cost of materials would be \u201ctoo much\u201d. \n\nThis is where I might genuinely be the a-hole. I told her that if she was too ashamed to have a fat brides maid in a strapless dress then she should just tell me instead of lie to me and I thought that over a decade of friendship transcended that vanity. That night I put no on my rsvp and sent it to her. \n\nNow she\u2019s calling and texting me telling me I misunderstood her and I\u2019m blowing up for no reason and to just come to the wedding as a guest.

Caring more about how having a \"fat bridesmaid\" is gonna look rather than wanting your best friend since 13 years old is legitimately and certifiably insane to me.

Jane sees that OP dress is costing much more than the others decided to drop OP from the bridal party. Not thinking things though Jane lies to OP about the reason for dropping her.

My best friends were with me that day, and it's all that mattered.", "The aesthetic argument is fine in moderation--if my bridesmaids were all wearing shades of idek blue but one wanted to wear red, yeah, I'd be like 'hey please match the vibe and aesthetics'. But if it's about something about them as *people* ffff no, that's where the whole argument is just gross. Either you love the people in your wedding party as they are or you don't.", "This was my first thought. What was the plan? \"We all did an Ancestry.com thing and turns out Dad was pretty wild in his youth! We're all related.\"\n\nIf OP had gone, imagine the hurt and shame she'd have felt when the wedding party came out and she was the only one not in it? How was the bride planning on handling that? Does she only want OP there so she doesn't have to explain to folks why she's a shallow B?", "I especially hate in-laws that think they get to have any opinion on your wedding day. Infuriating. I hope you told her to bugger off and mind her own business", "Haha the first bit of your comment \ud83e\udd23\n\nBut yeah that's what I was thinking how was she supposed to keep up the lie? Especially with all the other bridesmaids being friends it was bound to come out sooner or later as the events in the post show. Either ops friend it's really stupid or very very thoughtless and just thought  it would all work out somehow? \n\nHer concern for aesthetic over having her best friend in her wedding does have me leaning towards the latter.

You are NTAH and she is a major one.  You're friendship is over, period.

They're garbage.", "NTA how fucking awful of her. She should have let you decide if the cost was too much. Like was she going to let you show up to the wedding and find out then that you had been dropped. What a shitty \u201cfriend\u201d!", "Nope nta. Your not wrong and she got caught", "NTA\u2026 F* her! I wouldn\u2019t go either", "NTA; I mean, what was her excuse going to be if you only found out at the wedding that she lied?", "NTA. She insulted you and lied to you. She humiliated you in front of the rest of the party, and then tried to weasel out of accountability, by saying you took it wrong. \n\nI'm so sorry she treated you the way she did. Weddings bring out the worst in people.

You deserve better and honest friends.", "When did weddings go from being a celebration of love with friends and family to being a social media opportunity whose only value is how it \"looks\"??\r  \n\r  \nI am SO SORRY your \"friend\" treated you this way -- you must be so hurt and heartbroken! \r  \n\r  \nNTA", "NTA. I wouldn't go, and probably wouldn't speak to that friend again. I am petty, but that is some childish garbage she tried to pull.", "NTA.  Lies are not a misunderstanding.", "Oh, \u201cyou misunderstood\u201d, did you?\n\nPerhaps she\u2019d like to enlighten you about what she actually meant by her comments about the dress style and cost of materials, then. And why she lied about dropping others.\n\nNTA. I\u2019m sorry that your friend turned out to be so shallow.", "Nta. I don\u2019t get people who are so worried about how their bridesmaids look that they screw over friendships. I\u2019m getting married and my bridesmaids are wearing whatever the hell they feel most comfortable in.", "NTA,\n\nThis is the type of thing that ends long term relationships. It would have been one thing had she just wanted her sisters but she is absolutely body shaming you and flat out lied. \n\nIf my bestie had our mutual friends as groomsman and removed me without explanation I would be telling him to go fuck himself. In fact I would make sure that everyone would know why I was not going and just how rude the wedding couple was being.", "ESH.. your allowed to be fat and she's allowed to not spend extra money on a dress...  If this is a hill your willing to die on, then good luck", "> Now she\u2019s calling and texting me telling me I misunderstood her and I\u2019m blowing up for no reason and to just come to the wedding as a guest. Am I the a-hole?\n\nYeah, but none of that sounds like an apology. And if she's not apologizing, it sounds like you understood her *just fine*.\n\nNTA. It's a wedding invitation, not a contract.", "Jane is the AH, OP NTA!! I wouldn't go to the wedding either", "Oh my God, sweetheart you are not the asshole. I'm so sorry that your \"friend\" did this to you. For me, I chose my bridesmaids because they are close to me, not because of how they look. And they all looked beautiful, even the larger girls.

If you want you best friend in your wedding you suck it up and save money elsewhere.", "[removed]", "See, if Jane had given that as a reason instead of a complete lie, I\u2019d think your theory has some traction.  Instead, Jane made up a reason to excise OP from her bridal party, which points to less of a concern of cost and more to nonsense \u2018aesthetics.\u2019 \n\nAlso, Jane\u2019s lie was so poorly thought out that it would have been exposed day of the wedding, so hardly a solution if Jane was trying to allow OP to gracefully exit the bridal party.  Jane was banking on OP being too gracious/polite to call her out on her wedding day, and to not have to address the real issue until her wedding was over and the slight was in the past.", "It's possibly the extra time and cost involved in making a new pattern, more so than the fabric cost.  Depending on the measurements and dress style, this could involve a lot of custom work to measure and fit a bespoke dress.\n\nOP said the dress was strapless. If the required bust size and cup size is large, then the inside of the dress should really have a custom fitted corset style bodice, in order to provide adequate support and style. This is quite complex to do well, it potentially could require extra measurement and fitting, which would be costly.\n\nJane is definitely TA for handling this poorly.", "Jane is the AH because she lied to OP also if Jane really wanted OP to be the bridesmaid they could come up with another solution for her dress.", "I suspect she wasn't lying about the cost issue - she found out how much more material the custom made dress would be for her than for the other bridesmaids and didn't want to pay it. Dropping her is still terrible though.", "I actually don't think this is an aesthetic issue at all- her friend knew how OP looked before asking her to be a bridesmaid. I would bet money that OP's dress was going to cost more money than the others. If the designer had a starting base dress that OP doesn't fit, it would be a significant amount more.\n\nThe right thing to do would have been for her friend to tell OP the truth about why she was dropped or come up with a solution for the cost. It was pretty stupid and thoughtless to lie,  but I really doubt she was just being vain and cruel. \n\nOP is NTA and right to be upset, but I would talk to your friend again before writing off a lifelong friendship", "^ bot", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
