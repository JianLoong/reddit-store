Our moms were close and even after they eventually gravitated apart Jane and I still remained best friends until last week. \n\nI\u2019ve always been \u201cbig boned\u201d, since childhood I was the funny friend that lightened the mood with humor and positivity. And truthfully, none of my friends ever commented on my weight ever, even Jane. She usually made sure I was comfortable without ever explicitly pointing it out and during my insecure teen years I really appreciated that. Now that I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve learned to love who I am and I feel comfortable in my body. \n\nSince we were teens we always planned our weddings, talked about being each others bridesmaids, shared Pinterest boards.. the whole deal.. and that continued until we hit our early twenties. In fact, she asked me to be a bridesmaid as soon as she got engaged with a cute care package. However last week after I sent her my measurements for our dresses (she\u2019s having them custom made) she called me and said that b/c of costs she was cutting down the number of her bridesmaids to just her sisters. Which I totally understood! A couple days later, our mutual friend Liz sent me her final pick for her dress and asked me which color I had chosen. Confused I told her we had been dropped from the wedding party for not being immediate family, I called her because she is that one friend that responds to texts 2 weeks later and I assumed she just never saw Jane\u2019s message.  Liz immediately started up the group chat to confirm that we had been dropped and that\u2019s when I got a private message from Jane saying that she had only dropped me because she didn\u2019t think \u201cthe style she chose for everyone suited me\u201d and the cost of materials would be \u201ctoo much\u201d. \n\nThis is where I might genuinely be the a-hole. I told her that if she was too ashamed to have a fat brides maid in a strapless dress then she should just tell me instead of lie to me and I thought that over a decade of friendship transcended that vanity. That night I put no on my rsvp and sent it to her. \n\nNow she\u2019s calling and texting me telling me I misunderstood her and I\u2019m blowing up for no reason and to just come to the wedding as a guest. Am I the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1689745484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153m24w/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that she only dropped you and LIED about it to you is enough to make her TA. Don't go anywhere you don't feel respected or wanted. NTA at all mate. If I were in your shoes I'd not attend too, not because I got dropped but because they lied to me about it.", "NTA. Caring more about how having a \"fat bridesmaid\" is gonna look rather than wanting your best friend since 13 years old is legitimately and certifiably insane to me. It tells you how little she cares about you. Good for you for loving yourself enough to not deal with her bullshit. Do not go to that wedding and if anyone asks why you aren't coming? I would be telling the truth.", "NTA\n\nCalling out toxic people for toxic behavior is never an asshole move. \n\nShe made it clear that her aesthetics for her wedding meant more than your friendship. And I know that must be hard to hear, and it is awful losing a friend like this. \n\nAwful people show their true colors at the worst time. I would get ahead of the story before your friend makes a social media post about it where she lies about why you didn't go to the wedding or anything like that. \n\nShe made her choice. She gets to deal with the consequences. Take the money you were going to spend on this wedding and treat yo self to something nice.", "NTA you did not misunderstand a single thing. I'm sorry you had to find out that way about her.", "NTA. Sorry your friend sucks.", "NTA.  Jane is a shallow, stupid, lying twit.  She knew you would find out from someone else that you were the only one being dumped, and that she lied to you about it, which is quite cruel.  This \"woman\" is not a friend. \n\nOP, everything you said to Jane in response to her actions was the truth, nothing assholish about it. Why would you attend her wedding after she treated you so rudely and callously? She asked you to be a bridesmaid out of *friendship*, not your size, didn't she? \n\nRead that last sentence you wrote.  No apology, no contrition, she's blaming you for her bad behavior.  I'm sure Jane has gotten some blowback for her disgusting treatment of you.  She's calling and texting you because she just wants you to come to her wedding so everyone doesn't think she's the bad guy.  Well, she is.  Don't go.", "Nope \n\n NTA.\n\n Who needs that shit?", "NTA\n\nShe is not a nice person.  \n\nI hope you don't consider her a friend any longer.\n\nBlock her and get on with your life.\n\nHugs", "NTA. What you said wasn\u2019t AT ALL wrong. You were pointing out her lies and standing up for yourself. \n\nMy best friend and I have been bffs since we were about 6! (We\u2019re 31/32 now) If she did this, I would not attend. \n\nAnd\u2014-I\u2019d make sure people knew the reason. I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to bash her, but I would most definitely not lie if I was asked. Do shotty things, expect people to talk about it.", "NTA NTA NTA. It's amazing how people who are hurtful to 'friends' are so misunderstood.  I'm so sad for you to lose a friendship in this way.  I think I would just cut my losses here, and definitely not attend the wedding and probably not send a gift either.", "NTA. She should not have lied to you. Such a stupid lie, since you would obviously have found out at the wedding anyway. \nHow have you misunderstood her? I wonder. I don't think you have, though. She's trying to blame you for her dishonesty and crappiness.", "NTA. This is a really sucky situation and I'm sorry you are going through this. It sucks that weddings can bring out the worst in some people. Maybe she has revealed her true colors after all of these years. What I don't understand is why she would lie about it only being immediate family. Did she not think you would find out eventually? If not before the wedding, but during? That's a low blow on her end and I don't blame you for not wanting to go. I don't think there is anything she can say to redeem herself.", "NTA -  There wasn't much to misunderstand. She lied and then gave a lame excuse. You are rightfully ticked off.\n\nJust affirm that you decline attending as a guest and wish her and her fiance the best. Leave it at that.", "Nta. \n\nThis just made me sad, not that it\u2019s an excuse but she\u2019s known you since your teens. Why even ask you to join the bridal party if you weren\u2019t gonna fit the image she wants? \n\nI say good riddance, divide that bridal party. She deserves it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't fit into the bridal party look, physically, that's in her head. Screw that BS.

First she told an incredibly stupid lie (like you wouldn't notice you were the only one dropped), then compounded it with what can only be interpreted as insulting. The cost of materials thing is just a ridiculous thing to say. You didn't misunderstand anything.\n\nI can't imagine showing up at her wedding after that with a smile on my face pretending none of it happened.", "NTA the fact that she had you in the line and kicked you out is a major AH move. On top of that she lied on her reasons. Who gives a shit if you maybe bigger than the \u201caverage\u201d it\u2019s about having the people you care about there on an important day. The fact she did that shows that her priorities are not in the right place.

You didn't misunderstand, your \"friend\" is too busy thinking about her perfect photographs.  That was an absolutely shitty thing for her to do and I wouldn't want to go to her \"perfect\" wedding either.", "And let everyone who asks why you weren't there, the real reason.   Brides that feel their aesthetic is more important than friends are having a wedding not anadult marriage.", "May want to go back on that group chat. \" I'm sorry if I caused any confusion after Bride told me I was being dropped from the wedding party.

Why'd she lie to you and make you think it was just going to be her sisters as bm's? And then when you showed up the day of the wedding and saw all your friends in bm dresses...what was your response supposed to be?

I would, however, love it if you can make it to the wedding as a guest, and be there to give the wedding speech. I know things aren't what I planned, but I want you to be there for my big day. Hope you understand, call me and we'll talk about it. Once again, I'm so sorry for dropping the bomb like this.**\", and it would've made the situation better, but instead she not only lied about the actual reason, she actually told you the actual reason, that you're fat.
