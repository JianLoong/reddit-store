Our moms were close and even after they eventually gravitated apart Jane and I still remained best friends until last week. \n\nI\u2019ve always been \u201cbig boned\u201d, since childhood I was the funny friend that lightened the mood with humor and positivity. And truthfully, none of my friends ever commented on my weight ever, even Jane. She usually made sure I was comfortable without ever explicitly pointing it out and during my insecure teen years I really appreciated that. Now that I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve learned to love who I am and I feel comfortable in my body. \n\nSince we were teens we always planned our weddings, talked about being each others bridesmaids, shared Pinterest boards.. the whole deal.. and that continued until we hit our early twenties. In fact, she asked me to be a bridesmaid as soon as she got engaged with a cute care package. However last week after I sent her my measurements for our dresses (she\u2019s having them custom made) she called me and said that b/c of costs she was cutting down the number of her bridesmaids to just her sisters. Which I totally understood! A couple days later, our mutual friend Liz sent me her final pick for her dress and asked me which color I had chosen. Confused I told her we had been dropped from the wedding party for not being immediate family, I called her because she is that one friend that responds to texts 2 weeks later and I assumed she just never saw Jane\u2019s message.  Liz immediately started up the group chat to confirm that we had been dropped and that\u2019s when I got a private message from Jane saying that she had only dropped me because she didn\u2019t think \u201cthe style she chose for everyone suited me\u201d and the cost of materials would be \u201ctoo much\u201d. \n\nThis is where I might genuinely be the a-hole. I told her that if she was too ashamed to have a fat brides maid in a strapless dress then she should just tell me instead of lie to me and I thought that over a decade of friendship transcended that vanity. That night I put no on my rsvp and sent it to her. \n\nNow she\u2019s calling and texting me telling me I misunderstood her and I\u2019m blowing up for no reason and to just come to the wedding as a guest. Am I the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1689745484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153m24w/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Caring more about how having a \"fat bridesmaid\" is gonna look rather than wanting your best friend since 13 years old is legitimately and certifiably insane to me.

My best friends were with me that day, and it's all that mattered.", "The aesthetic argument is fine in moderation--if my bridesmaids were all wearing shades of idek blue but one wanted to wear red, yeah, I'd be like 'hey please match the vibe and aesthetics'. But if it's about something about them as *people* ffff no, that's where the whole argument is just gross.

We're all related.\"\n\nIf OP had gone, imagine the hurt and shame she'd have felt when the wedding party came out and she was the only one not in it? How was the bride planning on handling that?
