You scheduled your trip on a weekend when you are supposed to be with your mother.

Their bad scheduling should not result in your losing the money that you've already spent.", "NTA - Maybe this will be a wake up call for your dad that his kid is choosing a musical festival over his wedding.", "NTA\n\nHe gets what he gets.

If you were planning on going no-contact within the next 12 months anyway, dude, do your thing.  He knew that was your mom's weekend, not his weekend, so that was HIS bad move to plan his wedding for a weekend you weren't with him.", "NTA.

They opted not to. \n\nThey could have (should have) checked dates with you- or your mom- as soon as they were looking at dates, to ensure that if it wasn't your dad's weekend that you'd be available. They didn't.\n\nThis is the end result. They're going to be embarrassed on the day of the wedding because you aren't there. In wedding photos, you'll never be there. And when people ask...well, they'll probably lie. But you'll explain that you'd made plans months earlier for that weekend that weren't changeable and your dad had never told you when he was getting married. Unfortunately, you couldn't be in two places at once.\n\nNTA Some people may say that if it was their dad they'd change their plans but they're forgetting that their dad probably wouldn't have scheduled his wedding without thinking about them.", "NTA \n\nYou already have plans.

NTA. Your dads failure to be more involved in your life and doing daft schemes means that you will not be attending his wedding. Am attending a big wedding as a guest in a few months and had to confirm my attendance 6 months before it.
