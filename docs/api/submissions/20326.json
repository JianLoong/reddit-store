They opted not to. \n\nThey could have (should have) checked dates with you- or your mom- as soon as they were looking at dates, to ensure that if it wasn't your dad's weekend that you'd be available. They didn't.\n\nThis is the end result. They're going to be embarrassed on the day of the wedding because you aren't there. In wedding photos, you'll never be there. And when people ask...well, they'll probably lie. But you'll explain that you'd made plans months earlier for that weekend that weren't changeable and your dad had never told you when he was getting married. Unfortunately, you couldn't be in two places at once.\n\nNTA Some people may say that if it was their dad they'd change their plans but they're forgetting that their dad probably wouldn't have scheduled his wedding without thinking about them.", "NTA \n\nYou already have plans.
