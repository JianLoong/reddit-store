You were making turkey, and your daughter asked for something else. If one of your other kids asked for Turkey meatloaf and the third asked for filet of sole, would you make those, too? \n\n\nAlso, I am wondering why your first two kids are with your current wife, but your third child is with someone else. Could this have something to do with your wife's feelings?", "The meal is a symptom of a bigger problem. You are NTA for the chili, as long as there is enough for others. However, you state you put your youngest on a pedestal. I guarantee your wife and other children notice this and it is affecting them. The chili on Thanksgiving is just one more way that your golden child is being treated differently.\n\nI can relate to this as my husband has a daughter from his prior relation that he puts on a pedestal. Our 16 year old has asked over the years why he does so much for golden child but not her. He doesn't even realize that he makes comparisons but in a white washed way.  \n\nPlease consider how what you are doing is being perceived by the rest of your family. You are  correct to cater to her medical condition, but make sure you do special things for your wife and other children too.", "NTA I'd make enough chili for everyone to have some, then it's a side you can all enjoy and not a separate food for her.", "NTA and why does this bother your wife so much?

Sure, being \"Thankful\" is important, but, being Thankful that you can all have food surrounded by people you love and love you back is the most important.\n\nIt has nothing to do with turkey and fixings. \n\nTell your wife not to be so jealous. I know she wouldn't trade with your daughter and her circumstances for anything in the world.\n\nShe needs to sit down and let you handle things.\n\nNTA", "nta. it's thanksgiving not turkey only day. you made a considerate and accommodating meal for your daughter due to her medical condition. your wife should be more understanding and supportive. you're doing what's best for your child's well-being and that's what really matters.", "NTA\n\nThat said, is it possible your wife is feeling frustrated because the turkey dinner was made allergen-safe and then is not being eaten by the person it is allergen safe for? Many allergy replacements are.....less than equivalent to their allergen-unfriendly counterparts, and it's possible that she had made peace with the idea that the dinner would be allergen free if your daughter was eating with you but is frustrated that a special meal will have to be eaten allergen-free even though your daughter is in fact eating something entirely different. Maybe if she had known in advance that the dinner didn't NEED to be allergen friendly she might have wanted a specific dish she has not had the option to have in a long while.\n\nSpeaking as someone with celiac's my wife will prepare and eat celiac-safe meals with me almost 100% of the time, but sometimes if she knows I'm planning to eat something else altogether, she'll get or make her own thing because she misses treats or old favorites from before my diagnosis. Holidays and special occasions are especially difficult for this, and we often have a mix of items, some that I know are safe for me and some that I know are just for her sake. Even when done willingly and out of love, restrictive medical diets can be brutal, and maybe your wife wishes she could have known this was an opportunity to do something different that would meet a craving she has been struggling with for the past few months or even years.

This is not an issue of your daughter's allergy and being unable to eat something. This is an issue of entitlement and an issue of pickiness. Your daughter has gotten so used to placation of her allergy (which is TOTALLY understandable given the severity of it) that she now feels entitled to everyone making her special meals even when the meal available is something she can eat. \n\nIts a skill that she needs to learn, and you choose whether it is Thanksgiving you want to fall on this sword, but she truly does need to learn to eat what the family eats when it is a meal she can eat. You are not doing her favors here long term.", "nta. you're just trying to accommodate your daughter's dietary restrictions and make her feel comfortable on thanksgiving. it's not like you're excluding anyone else from enjoying turkey. your wife should understand and support your decision instead of berating you. keep doing what you're doing for the sake of your daughter's well-being.", "INFO: If one of your other kids \u201creally didn\u2019t like turkey\u201d would you make them a separate Thanksgiving meal?", "NTA.

As long as we've hosted Thanksgiving, I've always included a small ham and crock pot of chicken wild rice soup for those who may not be as excited over the main course as everyone else. \n\nIf you weren't doing the cooking, I'd say maybe she has a little wiggle room to complain, but she isn't.

I somehow doubt it.", "NTA\n\nMy spouse has alpha gal, he is also fume reactive and has had some very serious reactions to food we thought was safe.

It's a horribly restrictive disease and a lot  who have it are deficit in vitamins & nutrients due to limited food choices. \n  I think your wife is being ridiculous over you making an extra meal.  And please keep in mind not all turkey is safe, always check for Carrageenan!", "YWBTA\n\nIf her allergy isn't affected, I think it's unreasonable for her to request a separate dish simply because she doesn't want to eat turkey.

I agree with the comments that she needs to understand she can't request special treatment when there's already perfectly good food. But, just make enough of the chili that everyone can have some, so its not like she's getting special treatment. Almost every family gathering we have we now make sure to have a side of soup or chili that has more \"safe\" ingredients incase anyone shows up with gluten issues or even just a stomach ache that day. If the person cooking doesn't care, no big deal.. but she needs to share, it's not just for her. I still have a nasty memory of my stepdaughter screaming at her grandfather, refusing to share her GALLON BUCKET of ice cream because it was her \"safe dessert\" when she had a suspected nut allergy. It was embarrassing, and she was being a nasty, spoiled brat. Don't let your daughter fall into that role by making it super special, all about her. And if she is old enough, she can start cooking her own special additional dishes.", "Info is your daughter allergic to turkey and potatoes?", "nta. you're just being a considerate parent and accommodating your daughter's dietary needs. it's not like you were excluding anyone else from enjoying their thanksgiving meal. your wife should understand and support your decision.", "NTA, if a mom did this and the dad had an issue, it would be the same answer.
