It was just the two of them for 10 years. Case never knew her dad which means my sister had sole custody of Case. When she was little Casey used to talk a lot about how there were these mean girls in school. One of them, Valerie, Case disliked more than the others. She was the worst. My sister did her fair share of complaining about the dad too, especially when she had to replace an eraser a couple of weeks into school starting because Valerie broke it.\n\nWhen Case was 9 my sister and Valerie's dad started to spend time together and then they got married a year later. There was a lot of shock on my part seeing as my sister knew how Case felt about Valerie and given her own complaints about Valerie's dad allowing her to get away with so much. But he's an attractive guy and I guess that won out over everything else.\n\nThe announcement to Case went about as well as can be expected. She was furious at her mom. More so on her wedding day because my sister wanted the girls to match and look like sisters for the first time. Valerie used the wedding to taunt some of Case' friends, saying she was going to replace them with her. It only added fuel to an already bright fire. Case ultimately refused to take part in the wedding on the day and sat with me.\n\nThings in their household were tense for years afterward. My sister would get upset that Case was so mad about it, that she didn't change her opinion of Valerie at all, and that she would very strongly deny that they were sisters.\n\nAbout two years after she got married my sister decided they all needed family therapy.\n\nIt was only in the last two years that Valerie appears to have grown and from the outside it does not look like she's the bully she once was. But Case still cares nothing for her.\n\nBoth girls graduated in May and Case moved out and in with me, wanting to get away from Valerie. \n\nThe other day my sister and I met up for lunch and she was venting about Case not talking to Valerie at all and how Valerie had wanted them to meet up every day after classes started (they go to different colleges but both are local) but Case didn't even answer her. She said she thought after all these years Case would see Valerie as a true sister and even if she didn't like her, there would be some sense of family loyalty there. I was shocked to hear my sister say that. She noticed and asked me why I looked like a fish. I told her I had never expected her to be so naive to think Case would feel that way when she hated Valerie long before she (my sister) met her husband. My sister's attitude changed very fast and she told me that I'm the naive little brother to think these things don't change when family bonds are created. I told her that family bonds aren't created that easily when there is already bad blood present. No matter how much she might want them to be there.\n\nShe told me I owed her an apology and she'll be waiting for it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700662932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181a8s6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_was_naive_when_she/", "score": 1215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
