I've not met a single English person who hasn't told me a version of \"I wish I paid more attention in (insert foreign language) class\"\n\nYour partner needs to learn about your (our) culture before saying something this stupid again. Cause I bet he likes the food, he's just too lazy to learn another language and his whole stance on this comes from a place of laziness and fear he won't be able to understand your conversations. In which case he should learn Bulgarian.\n\nFor you, OP (even though Google translate) I'd say: \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0448 \u0441\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044c\u043e\u0440\u044a\u0442 \u0442\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u0438 \u043d\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0449\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0431. \u0415\u0437\u0438\u043a\u044a\u0442 \u043d\u0438 \u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043d \u0438 \u0434\u044a\u0449\u0435\u0440\u044f \u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430, \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0447\u0430.", "You're so lucky! What language was it and do you speak it now?\n\n\nMy mum's English and my Latino dad never spoke Spanish to us. I now live in Spain and wish so much that he had.\n\nOP, my girls are learning Spanish at school and doing great. I couldn't imagine not speaking my own language to them when they were babies. It would have been like not being allowed to *hold* them \ud83d\udc94 \n\nLove your baby the way you KNOW is right. You both deserve that.", ">Unless you think baby is a super genius who can become fullly fluent in listening, speaking, reading and writing two different languages prior to age 5,\n\nIf the kid is living in England reading and writing in Bulgarian doesn't need to be a priority. However, learning to understand and speak 2 languages at a time is possible for every run of the mil baby, not just the super genius ones. \n\n>If baby has weak language skills for the default language at her first school, she will fall way behind her peers and likely never catch up\n\n100% not true. Never catch up? Fall behind just cause she can speak a second language? Please.", "No, you cannot express your love for your child in another language the same way you can express it in your own. Yes, you can say the words, yes the mean the same, but the feeling you get speaking to your kid in your own language is completely different. \n\nAnd why should her level of English matter in this situation?\n\nAnd let's not talk about intentions because when you have a couple with a different native language who have a child why does it need to be something specifically communicated and talked about and discussed that the mother/father intends speak in their own language to rhwir child? I call BS on that, cause it should be the norm and the expected thing to do.\n\n\nBTW if you're mute and express your love in sign language THAT IS A NATIVE LANGUAGE. So why is it not okay to express your love in another language?", "What race are the majority of Bulgarians?\n\nOP is NTA, but the reasoning of her partner is at least 40 years out of date. Teaching a child dual languages and their ability to learn and be fluent in both is not understood by everyone. OP can easily find some literature online that will highlight the advantages of raising a child bilingual.", "Xenophobic, not racist.", "Neither did mine, they were actually early. But I have read about this as well.", "I'm Dutch and the only way I can communicate with my Irish cousins is in English, though they have a Dutch father. Really a shame. They were able to understand some Dutch sentences from our grandma, but couldn't answer.\n\nIt is sad, especially since speaking Dutch also benefits their Irish somehow.", "My mom tried doing this with me. However, she sent me to school too early. As a result, I can understand Spanish pretty well but have trouble speaking it back.", "They are diagnosed with ADHD? Maybe they think quicker than the monolinguals ( which they do) and get bored much quicker.", "if that were the case then every one of the chinese kids in my pre-k wouldn't have had a slight chinese accent", "Languages should be kept completely separate. Parents should only speak in one language to the child always, no exception, not a mixture. \nIf the mom mixes languages when speaking to the child then that is the reason he isn't speaking yet. Mom is confusing the hell out of him, poor kid. Please, only speak your own language to him and nothing else.", "Xenophobic after he has a kid with a foreigner! Christ almighty you lot always go for the most extreme option. \n\nMore likely he's uninformed of how easy kids pick up multiple languages and worries his kid wont be able to speak English in England.", ">It's better to master one language prior to entering school as opposed to half-assed kind sorta mixing two languages when your teacher starts giving you assignments in only one language.\n\nLiterally none if this is true \ud83d\ude02\n\n>So unless both parents are going to spend hours a day every day to get the kid that miraculous dual-language mastery...\n\nYou don't even need 2 parents. As someone with 2 nephews who are born in Germany to not-german parents, they grew up with learning 2 languages simultaneously just fine. In fact, OP's daughter will probably, at least in het first 9-10 years, speak English better than bulgarian because she will speak it in school, will be around it all day and all her friends will speak it. But she will also grow up KNOWING (not learning) her other native language.", "Nah, Bulgaria isn't great to live in with their current salary, COL and perpetual corrupt politicians IMHO \n\nThe roads are also terrible and can give you a concussion and they've been fixing them for 20 years \ud83d\ude02", "Pre-k would be their first exposure to kids with the local accent, a few grades in and it'll be gone. Unless there are enough Chinese kids they all socialise together and not with local accented peers.\n\nhttps://www.stmarysrydalmere.catholic.edu.au/Community/News/2021/01/27/03/06/Language-experts-say-children-get-different-accents-as-they-get-more-school-friends", "Looks like it! Sorry for the confusion :)", "Needing to move away from the UK makes a lot of sense. Such a shame, although I guess for some that is in and of itself a reason to do the degree in the first place.\n\nAnd yes, literary translation is so underappreciated (and underpaid)! I have enough language skills to get by in my work, but definitely not enough to translate to anything like that level. They are both awesome individuals - I do feel lucky to have taught them."]}
