As a kid, it's freaking easy! Both my kids have been exposed to the english language a lot (besides our native language), and by 3 or 4 years, the could speak both languages.\n\nI'm just really sorry I never learned my mothers language, since I had the chance to be bilingual.

But he is far more comfortable speaking in English because of the school, his friends, the TV, etc. \n\nMany of his friends come from families where at least one of the parents speaks another language too and they put a lot of effort to make sure their children do learn that language.

You could be a mute and never be able to speak to your son at all, and you'd be able to express your love to him. By the way, I 100% agree that it's the best life choice to teach your child your langugage.  It's such a valuable gift in so many different ways.

Will she be living in Bulgaria for more than a few months at a time at any point before her 10th birthday?\n\nIf not, then it's more important for you to speak/practice English than it is for baby to hear / learn Bulgarian.\n\nThe critical point of language education is prior to 1st grade.  If baby has weak language skills for the default language at her first school, she will fall way behind her peers and likely never catch up.  But she can learn a 2nd language later.  Nothing wrong with that.  \n\nUnless you think baby is a super genius who can become fullly fluent in listening, speaking, reading and writing two different languages prior to age 5, then her focus really needs to be on learning English right now.

What you have said is actually inaccurate.

There are many many studies on multilingual kids. Babies can learn two, three languages easily. There is nothing miraculous about it. Even four doesn't seem to be a problem, it is just more rare to have consistent exposure to four languages (but does happen in certain communities). \n\nI speak French consistently with my kids since birth while they were raised in Germany. Their German is perfect and they are fluent in French as well, although they have less exposure due to not living there. They are ordinary kids. Lots of people are raised multilingual, it is completely ordinary in many families.\n\nThis kid will have so many people to speak english to her, including her own father, daycare/school, friends, TV. She will learn it with no problem."]}
