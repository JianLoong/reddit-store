His lack of remorse the minute you called tells me this was not done in good faith. Finally, he claims it was too severe \"over a few books\" -- but we bibliophiles know books are like our babies, and the fact that he doesn't respect your boundaries regarding your valuables, means he's not worth interacting with.  Ultimately, you'll have to decide how this works with your mutual friends, but he's definitely sus. As far as helping him out because he lost his job, not in a million years: tell him to go pound sand (aka F*ck off).
