She told me to look for one I wanted, but I haven\u2019t done it yet because I want to make sure and find the right one. I looking for one that was around $500 or less with decent specs, touchscreen, and not too big/heavy. Earlier today though, she told me she bought one and it was already delivered, and she wanted me to open it to make sure it worked and everything. When she showed me which one she gothowever, it was a $1300 gaming laptop. I was surprised and loved that she got me such a good gaming laptop, but I also felt really bad. I already have a pretty good desktop pc to play games on, so I would almost never play games on the laptop. It had a 3070 which is a pretty big upgrade than what I have in my pc, but I still don\u2019t think I would play on it instead of my desktop. And when I read the reviews, It said the battery was bad (only lasting for about 3-4 hours when not gaming). I felt bad because it was so much money, and I would only use it for taking notes, writing essays, watching videos, and to do other school stuff. I told her about all this, and said that I appreciate it, but I would rather her return it and get a much cheaper but better laptop for what I am going to use it for than what she got. She got pretty sad/mad and said she was just trying to get the best laptop for me, and would return it and get whatever I want. She called me ungrateful quite a lot, but I just didn\u2019t want her to spend that much money on that kind of laptop.

You\u2019re the exact opposite of being inconsiderate, and I would love the crap out of your thoughtfulness towards her if she were me.", "She sounds disappointed, but it sounds like you are trying to save her money. You explained this for her, but she probably thought she was going above and beyond and wanted to make you happy, but you\u2019re concerned that she spent way too much money for more computer than you needed.  NTA.", "NAH.\n\nYou feel guilty that she spent so much money on you, when there were cheaper options. She wants you to have the best computer possible. Both parties feelings have merit. \n\nTbh, I\u2019m not sure what the right thing to do here is.", "NTA. Your mom is kinda sucky here though, calling you ungrateful is a low blow. \n\nThere is a difference in being ungrateful and being honest when something doesn't meet the needs you currently have. Especially when she asked you to pick one then went ahead and randomly bought one.", "NTA. You sound like a very thoughtful kid! I second you telling her that you REALLY appreciate that she got you the souped up laptop and how lucky you are to be her kid. We moms love to hear that.", "NTA, if you explained your reasoning. \n\nComing from someone in IT who personally builds his workstations and custom orders his laptops, I completely understand where you are coming from. A gaming laptop has no place in college imo. It's heavy, the battery is used up in less than an hour, and for all that beef you gain no advantage in your school work (unless it's design / maybe compsci). You also seem to have extremely realistic ideas about what you need for a school laptop. \n\nThat being said your mom, as all loving parents that know little about technology, obviously went above and beyond to support you. How you cross this bridge in my opinion is completely based on you and your mother's relationship. Does she want to know more about what you need? Or does she want to just forget about this whole thing? \n\nPersonally, in your case I wouldn't feel bad about it. You are trying to save your mom's money while getting a better tool for your school work. If you truly explained it all to her like you did to us, she should not be calling you ungrateful. If my son said \"Dad thanks for getting me the Switch, but I really only need the Switch Lite\", I'd fall over backwards. \n\nYou seem like a great person who has a good head on their shoulders. This will hopefully all blow over and it will be a distant memory well before you walk across that stage. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. These conversations are always difficult and emotional. But gentle, honest communication is always the right answer. I'm guessing your mom will get over it, just make sure you go out of your way to tell her how much it meant to you that she bought you a better, more expensive laptop, and make sure you continue to thank her after you get the other one too.", "NTA, I think being candid will help you and her. It wouldn\u2019t bring her joy to see you rarely using the expensive gift.", "NTA \nI understand trying to be grateful for a present, but it's better in the long term that you save her money and have a laptop you really need.", "NTA- but why can\u2019t all moms be this evil.  :)", "NTA. If it isn\u2019t what you need, and it really cost so much, you did her a favor", "Soft YTA.\n\nYour instinct to not want people to lavish you with unnecessarily expensive gifts is good, but the laptop is perfectly functional for what you need it for and your mom tried to go above and beyond to get you a gift you'd like. Further, as you described it, you're clearly looking for reasons to dislike the gift (a battery life of 3-4 hours is perfectly fine for note taking in classes), which will make you seem ungrateful even if you genuinely do think the gift went overboard", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He literally did the most considerate thing he could've done.", "Yes. This is true", "Compsci major here. Nothing I've had to do so far has required anything that would take more than a cheap laptop (so long as it supported virtualization) cause I am still working on an old i7-4770k pc to do all of the schoolwork required for compsci courses. \n\nI do know some could be more specialized in whats required depending on the courses, but I can't imagine anything in a compsci class taking more than mine has so far, which was, running multiple server VMs at once.\n\nOP is NTA, and gaming laptops are realistically only designed to be used plugged in. Too much beef for a battery for extended use for no real gain."]}
