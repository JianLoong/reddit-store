About a month ago, her best friend passed away from cancer. My daughter has been living on her own, but after her friend passed away, she asked me if it was okay to stay at my house for a while because she didn\u2019t want to feel lonely and she was feeling very depressed. Of course, I accepted and she has been staying in the guest room for about two weeks. \r  \nOver the past two weeks, my spoons, forks, knives, plates, bowls AND cups have been going missing. I had a feeling that it was Adriana, so I kindly told her that if she had any dishes in her room, she could bring them to the sink so I could wash them. Well, no dishes appeared in the sink, but I did notice something shiny in the trash that day. I saw a fork poking out from underneath a pile of used paper towels. I pulled out the paper towels, which revealed a plate with food on it, a fork and a knife.\r  \nI took the plate and walked to the guest room and asked Adriana if she had thrown out the plate. She started telling me that she did and that she was sorry. I told her that it wasn\u2019t acceptable for her to just throw away my things! I have plastic, paper, glass and ceramic plates. She was throwing out my expensive ceramic plates instead of using the paper or plastic ones. I was very upset with her, but I asked her why. Her reasoning was that since she has been very depressed, she hasn\u2019t had the energy to wash her dishes or put them in the sink. Instead, she just throws them away in the trash then wipes down the counters and throws the used paper towels on top. \r  \nI was beyond angry when she told me she has been doing this since she has been staying with me, which means most of the items she threw away are gone. This is where I think I may have gone wrong. I told her that if she didn\u2019t repay me for the dishes by the end of the week (about $120) that she is going to have to go back to staying at her own place. She started yelling at me and telling me that I should be understanding and that I don\u2019t understand what she is going through right now. I then told her that she had to leave that day and that I would be expecting the money by the end of the week. \r  \nThat leads me to today. She left when I asked her to, but this happened last week, and she still hasn\u2019t paid me back or even reached out. So, AITA for being upset with my depressed daughter and asking her to repay me for throwing away my silverware and dishes?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1704519944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zst2o/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_depressed_daughter/", "score": 349, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is $120 something she just needs to get out of the bank or does she have to come up with it from somewhere on the middle of being in such a bad place? \n\nI think her throwing out dishes is ridiculous and inconsiderate. It honestly makes no sense to me\u2026. Its very odd behaviour that goes beyond depression IMO. Letting them pile up in her room is better thN tossing them. But why not in the sink and there are paper plates available?? And the fact that she\u2019s been doing it for two weeks is crazy pants. \n\nNta but I think your approach could have definitely been better. I\u2019d drop it for now.

It's fair to be upset, because it sucks to lose those dishes. In my opinion it is extremely bizarre to throw away \"real\" dishes. If this behaviour is totally out of the norm for your daughter then yeah, YTA, you could be upset but also find a place for more curiosity and compassion. Is she truly that depressed that it's effecting her judgement and functioning?? If that's the case she probably really needs help (though it's still reasonable to set boundaries e.g. she needs to pay you back eventually, and can only use paper plates for now).

Priorities and all that!\n\nShe came to live with you so she wouldn't be lonely during her grief and depression - so how was it that it took you so long to notice there was a problem? Have you not eaten with her, or talked to her while she was staying with you? Were you encouraging her to engage with a therapist or go to a grief support group? Did you even try empathy and sharing your own grief stories, or did you just hand her the bill and tell her to get out of your house?\n\nBecause yes, she acted badly and irrationally, but I'm not surprised that she hasn't contacted you again. And frankly that very irrationality makes me more worried for her wellbeing than for your money.", "YTA. She's suffering from severe grief and has had a break from reality, she doesn't know what is normal and how to function. She needs professional help. Importantly she needs compassion and love from the person she reached out to for help in this horrible time, that's you.

It was like a scale almost, the more someone mentioned it the less likely it was that that was the issue.", "That is indeed worth criticism; however, whataboutism is not a strong argument for giving some additional consideration to one's actions.", "Consider this, I have ADHD and depression, doesn\u2019t take a doctor to assume I\u2019m also navigating anxiety as well so you betcha I\u2019ve considered the extremely minimal environmental impact. \n\nYou sound rigid and short-sighted."]}
