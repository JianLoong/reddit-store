About a month ago, her best friend passed away from cancer. My daughter has been living on her own, but after her friend passed away, she asked me if it was okay to stay at my house for a while because she didn\u2019t want to feel lonely and she was feeling very depressed. Of course, I accepted and she has been staying in the guest room for about two weeks. \r  \nOver the past two weeks, my spoons, forks, knives, plates, bowls AND cups have been going missing. I had a feeling that it was Adriana, so I kindly told her that if she had any dishes in her room, she could bring them to the sink so I could wash them. Well, no dishes appeared in the sink, but I did notice something shiny in the trash that day. I saw a fork poking out from underneath a pile of used paper towels. I pulled out the paper towels, which revealed a plate with food on it, a fork and a knife.\r  \nI took the plate and walked to the guest room and asked Adriana if she had thrown out the plate. She started telling me that she did and that she was sorry. I told her that it wasn\u2019t acceptable for her to just throw away my things! I have plastic, paper, glass and ceramic plates. She was throwing out my expensive ceramic plates instead of using the paper or plastic ones. I was very upset with her, but I asked her why. Her reasoning was that since she has been very depressed, she hasn\u2019t had the energy to wash her dishes or put them in the sink. Instead, she just throws them away in the trash then wipes down the counters and throws the used paper towels on top. \r  \nI was beyond angry when she told me she has been doing this since she has been staying with me, which means most of the items she threw away are gone. This is where I think I may have gone wrong. I told her that if she didn\u2019t repay me for the dishes by the end of the week (about $120) that she is going to have to go back to staying at her own place. She started yelling at me and telling me that I should be understanding and that I don\u2019t understand what she is going through right now. I then told her that she had to leave that day and that I would be expecting the money by the end of the week. \r  \nThat leads me to today. She left when I asked her to, but this happened last week, and she still hasn\u2019t paid me back or even reached out. So, AITA for being upset with my depressed daughter and asking her to repay me for throwing away my silverware and dishes?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1704519944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zst2o/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_depressed_daughter/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Depression isn't an excuse to throw dishes away; she knows she doesn't have the energy to wash the dishes and that there are paper plates but she can't bother using them.

She has a choice , either reimburse you and stop the behavior or leave in the stated time frame. She also made a choice not to use your disposable options.

I\u2019ve been suicidally depressed in the past but at no point did I throw out dishes. I know every depression is different but it would be one thing if she threw out her own stuff.

Like worry about the money later? \n\nIt\u2019s also likely that your daughter wasn\u2019t just lacking energy \u2014 she was acting out.

I've been super depressed in the past, and have ADHD, and I've left shit to pile up long enough for a housemate to ask me to do it, but would never throw out a dish and cutlery, that's completely wild.", "NTA. She obviously knew what she was doing but didn't even tell you when you offered to wash them for her. You had to find them in the bin. Depression and grief don't justify such odd, disrespectful and deceitful behaviour. I don't think you went too far with the consequences at all. She doesn't get to essentially steal from you and abuse your hospitality because she's upset. Hopefully when she's feeling more like herself she will come back and apologise.", "For 2 weeks she have been throwing away ur silverware and dishes,those cost a lot.And Adriana saying she didn\u2019t have energy to put them in the sink or grab a paper plate,I\u2019m not trying to be mean but it\u2019s not that hard.You should get the money for you dishes.", "She doesn\u2019t have the energy to put the dishes in the sink but she DOES have the energy to put them in the trash and wipe the counters off? \n\nYeah no.", "Sorry, she hasn't got the energy to put a plate in the sink but somehow has the energy to wipe the counters down? When I was suicidal depressed, I just let everything pile up \u2013 I didn't throw away dishes and silverware.\n\nNTA, what a weird situation. So weird I wonder if it's actually real.", "Nta, and she couldn't be bothered to even leave your dishes in silverware in the sink, even if you didn't clean them. She was just being lazy and not depressed because apparently she wasn't so depressed that you couldn't throw things out. You were right to tell her to leave even though she might have been depressed. She was still being completely disrespectful to you. You go to try to help your daughter and this is how she pays you.\n\nBut on the negative side, it's probably going to be a while to your relationship is better because she feels that material possessions are an important over her mental health.\n\nAnd if there's things at your house that you left, put them in trash bags, store them someplace out of sight, and when she asks where they are say oh I was too depressed to leave them there so I threw everything you had out.

She knows what she is doing is wrong. NTA", "NTA. She is depressed so she wastes your money. This is not okay.", "Oh poor me I am so depressed I can't do an easy thing, like just leave my dishes in my room or on the counter but have to go over to the trash bin and throw them in there.  This is a nasty way to demand attention and you were right to call her on it.  Bet you she is telling other people some victim version of this for more sympathy. \n\nBeen depressed on and off for most of my life and I learnt early that it was no excuse to fuck other people's belongings over it.", "Nta for being upset. \n\nBut kicking her out that day and also expecting her to pay you by the end of the week (still) on top of expecting her to reach out to you while she\u2019s depressed and mourning is a bit much\n\nWhat\u2019s her financial situation? Is $120 something she just needs to get out of the bank or does she have to come up with it from somewhere on the middle of being in such a bad place? \n\nI think her throwing out dishes is ridiculous and inconsiderate. It honestly makes no sense to me\u2026. Its very odd behaviour that goes beyond depression IMO. Letting them pile up in her room is better thN tossing them. But why not in the sink and there are paper plates available?? And the fact that she\u2019s been doing it for two weeks is crazy pants. \n\nNta but I think your approach could have definitely been better. I\u2019d drop it for now. Is pushing this end of the week deawdline really worth $120? I\u2019d address it later and maybe see if she\u2019s ok? Your point has been made. \n\nNot sure if I\u2019d invite back to stay though honestly it\u2019s just a weird level of inconsideration especially for as 29 yr old", "I don't know, honestly. It's fair to be upset, because it sucks to lose those dishes. In my opinion it is extremely bizarre to throw away \"real\" dishes. If this behaviour is totally out of the norm for your daughter then yeah, YTA, you could be upset but also find a place for more curiosity and compassion. Is she truly that depressed that it's effecting her judgement and functioning?? If that's the case she probably really needs help (though it's still reasonable to set boundaries e.g. she needs to pay you back eventually, and can only use paper plates for now). If your daughter is known to be a bit selfish or not take responsibility, and this behaviour is not surprising from her, maybe you're NTA... I don't feel I have enough information.", "ESH. Your daughter absolutely should not have thrown out your china and silverware. However, I'm kind of shocked that you aren't more worried for her wellbeing, because this all seems very much like a cry for help to me. Priorities and all that!\n\nShe came to live with you so she wouldn't be lonely during her grief and depression - so how was it that it took you so long to notice there was a problem? Have you not eaten with her, or talked to her while she was staying with you? Were you encouraging her to engage with a therapist or go to a grief support group? Did you even try empathy and sharing your own grief stories, or did you just hand her the bill and tell her to get out of your house?\n\nBecause yes, she acted badly and irrationally, but I'm not surprised that she hasn't contacted you again. And frankly that very irrationality makes me more worried for her wellbeing than for your money.", "YTA. She's suffering from severe grief and has had a break from reality, she doesn't know what is normal and how to function. She needs professional help. Importantly she needs compassion and love from the person she reached out to for help in this horrible time, that's you. She could very well be on the brink of suicidal feelings and you putting the loss of your dishes over the loss of her friend might send her over the edge. You need to go into her room and apologize and let her cry into your shoulder and get it all out and then get her professional help.", "NTA. I've been the big sad spoon hoarder before, but I've never thrown them out...that's beyond weird. She doesn't get to do that. She doesn't get to throw out your stuff for no reason. I have no idea how she thought that was truly the better option.\n\nI've definitely messed up Tupperware though. Some of that's gone in the recycling bin...", "NTA It's not depression that is driving her behaviour  its something else.   \n\nShe could have asked you to wash them.", "NTA- I've had clinical depression since I can remember and I have never thrown dishes away because I couldn't be bothered with washing them. \n\nShe needs to pay you back.", "INFO: if you had come out to the kitchen to see her dirty plate in the sink, or left on the side, what would your reaction have been?\n\nDo you think other people would describe you as \u201cobsessional\u201d about cleanliness?\n\nThis sounds like \u201cmissing reasons\u201d to me - if the two of you have a good enough relationship for her to ask to stay when she\u2019s feeling sad & lonely, and you welcome her in - why would she be doing something so bizarre as throwing plates away *and wiping down the sides* rather than leaving them dirty in the sink\u2026?", "Nta", "NTA - she did this intentionally and then hid it.
