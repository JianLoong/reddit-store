I (31M) have been dating my GF (28F) for 3 years now. We love each other and get along really well. I make around 50k give or take and she makes over 250k as a dentist. Recently I have been eyeing some new laptops as my old one broke. The new generation of gaming laptops start coming out in February. So I was just going to wait and see what the pricing/availability is for them. Well, my GF took the liberty of buying me a new one. It seems nice on paper, but I told her it's not the one I wanted because the new ones are about to come out. She started to cry when I told her she should just return it and get her money back. I told her I am not mad at her and thanks for the effort but she said I am just ungrateful. Well I told her I'm just going to give her some space and time for a few days. She kept telling me I don't have to leave her house but I said no I'll let you clear her head. She has texted me a few times since yesterday questioning why won't I answer her texts.

Let that sink in a bit. She gave you a gift, it's not the one you want so you tell her it's not what you want and then you wall away and give her the silent treatment? \n\nFirst of all, why would you tell her you're not mad at her? That's just not logical. You have nothing to be mad about, she gave you a gift, that isn't something you would have any right being angry over. Disappointed its not the one you want?

I do still need a laptop, I just want XXXX. Could you help me find one?\" \n\nUSE YOUR WORDS. YTA for how you're handling it. fool.", "You sound super entitled, I'm really hoping you aren't. It's incredibly wrong to not respond to her texts, also", "YTA. You're coming  off as a child that can't have a mature conversation and decides to ghost instead.", "YTA.  Say thank you next time.", "NTA for the laptop thing, because I totally get wanting what you want specs-wise when it comes to something you use often. But YTA for how you treated her. You upset her and then ghost her? What in the world? I mean, the title itself is kind of a dead giveaway for how you feel about her right now, when that doesn't seem to frame the situation as you tell it at all, and I think I can confidently say that it's not about the laptop.", "YTA, but if this isn't a troll post, it also feels like you might genuinely not understand people's feelings and it's not intentional.\n\nPeople cry for a lot of different reasons. It can be because they're sad with themselves, upset with you, frustrated at the situation, etc. When this happens, not everyone requires space, and if they do, they will ask for it themselves. Sometimes people need a hug, reassurance you care, or that you still like them even if they make the mistake. Giving space people don't ask for can feel like silent treatment, which is an abuse tactic where people intentionally ignore you until they get what they want from you. In this case, it makes it seem like you're ignoring her until she gets you the better laptop that you actually wanted, whether it's intentional or not. \n\nIf you feel uncomfortable being around sad people and need to step away, that's okay - you need to express it clearly before you remove yourself so they know everything will be okay. People who feel insecure about their relationship with you, if they care about you, will feel even more upset and not knowing if you're gone forever or not. That's why you ignoring your girlfriend's texts hurts her feelings so much more.\n\nAnd, gift giving is about the thought and the intention behind it, not the item itself, so when you were overly frank, said you werent mad (wrong word choice because why would you be, it was free and you were planning on buying it yourself), and told her to return it, you really hurt your girlfriends feelings. In this case, you should have said \"thank you, that was really thoughtful of you to do (because it was thoughtful, she knew you wanted a gaming computer and spent a lot of money on one for you).\" and accept it and get your own computer anyways. Or, you could say, \"that was really nice of you to do, but I have been waiting for a specific gaming laptop to come out because it has the requirements that I need for the types of games I like to play. I'd still like to get that laptop, but I don't want you to feel like your gift went to waste. Can we return it and go half on the new laptop?\" and then buy her dinner in thanks for being gracious.\n\nText her that you'd like to meet at her house or get coffee somewhere, anyplace you'd like to meet. You should meet her in person, because you left her in person, and tell her you're sorry that you hurt her feelings and didn't respond to her text messages. Acknowledge that you don't know how to respond to sad people, and that you will do your best next time to listen to her when she tells you what she needs. And that you appreciate her thoughtfulness in getting you a present that she thought you'd like, and you're sorry for not showing her how much you appreciated the fact that she wanted to do that for you.", "YTA- I read your comments and you sound so dumb for a 31 year old. How naive can you be? Stop saying that your gf needed space cause doesn\u2019t want it. You do. Even though she had the right to be upset by your reaction and how you\u2019re acting now. Either give your balls a tug or end it and don\u2019t date anymore. Your brain can\u2019t comprehend what being an adult with communication is", "I don't understand this post at all.\n\nWhy mention your salaries? What purpose is that to serve? Do you feel there's relationship inequity? Do you want her to buy you the most expensive laptop?\n\nWhy leave the house? She's upset, but your concern about the laptop is valid. Why bolt out of the house and refuse to answer her messages? Are YOU the one who needs space? Are you just projecting a need for space on her?\n\nAre you actually committed to this relationship? You say you love her, but you ghosted her with little warning, and clearly don't care how she feels. She also had a very immediate and emotional reaction which makes me think you do this a lot.\n\nKnee jerk conclusion: you use emotional abuse to get what you want because of the income disparity that you feel bad about. Tell me I'm wrong. If not, YTA.", "YTA\n\nYeah, I get you wanted a specific type of PC. Her gift wasn\u2019t exactly what you wanted, but on a technicality. Imagine wanting the iPhone 14 and she got you the iPhone 13. It\u2019s such a negligible difference that you are ungrateful for acting this way.\n\nYou gave her space when she didn\u2019t want/need space. YOU wanted space because you were upset about getting a 2022 model PC instead of 2023. \n\nShes a successful dentist and you make slightly above the median income. Are you going to have a fit and ghost her every time she buys you something that you want, but want the slightly better and more expensive version? If she buys you a 2023 Honda Civic, are you going to get upset that it\u2019s not a Mercedes?", "INFO: Do you think maybe part of the reason you don\u2019t make more is that you have cream of wheat for brains?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve read through some comments now, and no longer have this question as the answer is clear. I hope your GF grows a pair and works through whatever issues had her dating you, and moves on. Time for you to go back to the kids table - you clearly have no idea how to communicate like an adult - while I\u2019d normally have a lot of grace for someone who needs therapy, it\u2019s also clear you have no intention of working on yourself or learning how to manage emotion - yours or anyone else\u2019s. If I were in her shoes I\u2019d be changing the locks right about now.", "YTA - lmao my gf bought me a new laptop and I told her it wasn't good enough and to return it and then ghosted her to convince her she was in the wrong? Make it make sense.", "NTA.  Your GF got overly emotional about not getting the expected joy from watching you open her gift to you.  Your reaction was simply not what she expected.  This is a good example of how she will react when more important things don't go as planned in life.  I would advise you to take a good hard look at what your future would look like with her acting like this.", "Clear her head of the silly thoughts that made her think he might actually be in the wrong, obviously /s\n\nOP is one of those classic manipulators who isn\u2019t even self aware enough to realise that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.

He\u2019s punishing her without using his words. It\u2019s covert emotional abuse. Imagine you try to do something nice for someone and they repay you by ghosting you? wow", "Exactly! He's mad she didn't get the right one, its why he said I'm not mad, but it's not the one I want. Why else frame it as somethign he could even be mad about.

It's been a few days and idk what to say.", "If you want space say that don't pin it on her", "Yep", "I think so too because OP said under my comment was that he gave her space because her reaction was crying to him not being thrilled about the gift.

Smth is off about that too", "This", "I'd fully agree here.

Your gf crying because you upset, shouldn't cause you to run away for a few days, ghost her, then blame it on OP thinking she needed space (after telling him she didnt). This is a messy one. Lol", "She said she was sad because of my reaction (or lack thereof) to her gift so I gave her some space? I though that was the right thing to do?", "Cause her reaction was crying when I wasn't thrilled with her gift? (That I didn't ask for)", "No she was tearing up when I told her that it's not the one I wanted. That's why I left.", "Cause she said I was ungrateful and need to repent?", "She started to cry when I told her I was going to buy the new one that comes out in a few weeks.

She tried to surprise with something that even you say was \"nice on paper\" because she liked you. And it's fair enough you said that it wasn't right and best to return and get a new model once released. But did you say thank you for caring about me enough to want to give me a present? Or was it just, I don't want that. Take it back. I suspect that she wasn't crying because she got the wrong laptop. But because you couldn't appreciate the thought behind it.\n\nAnd then because she was crying, you got uncomfortable and left but blamed her for the need to leave. She needed space to get her emotions in order to stop you being uncomfortable. Then you ignored her. I suspect you wouldn't have a relationship to worry about shortly.", "It made it look like you left because of the gift.", "YTA for leaving because of such a small disagreement. Yes, it\u2019s okay you didn\u2019t want the gift she bought you. Packing your shit up and leaving while she\u2019s crying is honestly an asshole move. Her intentions were pure. Sounds like you want to break up with her regardless\u2026 let this poor girl move on.", "Why would you leave your girlfriend when she's crying and clearly wants you to be there?", "If your plan is to leave every time you upset your SO then you are and forever will be TA. I can\u2019t believe you are 31, you are acting like a 16yo", "This comment right here makes you the biggest AH.", "It sounds like *you* need space, not her. It\u2019s weird that you\u2019re putting the need for space on her without properly communicating what *you* want. You\u2019re definitely NTA for not wanting the laptop or for being weirded out by her reaction. Not even the AH for wanting space. But the way you\u2019re communicating it is strange.", "OP you aren\u2019t ta for not wanting the gift. It\u2019s been said and agreed numerous times that for expensive purchases that you and a partner have discussed but not agreed on which one, need to NOT be surprises. \n\nIf you need space fine. But you need to communicate that instead of trying to flip the ignoring onto her and act like it\u2019s her wish & benefit. Very much YTA for that.", "i mean what else can you do but communicate though?  she said you're ungrateful, and that's not true, but you can't run away.  it's definitely a rough patch if the only way you two can handle disagreements is by running away from each other.  \n\ndo you feel some type of way about making less than her?  does she make you feel some type of way about it?  these things need to be teased out and discussed if they are subconsciously or consciously causing issues.", "What you should have done doesn\u2019t much matter at this point. \n\nWhat should you do now?  You should call her, text her, start the apology. \n\nShe didn\u2019t do anything wrong or to hurt you and she wasn\u2019t expecting your reaction of bluntly telling her it was wrong. You do seem ungrateful in that instance. \n\nStart by saying you\u2019re sorry, you overreacted, and that you\u2019d been eyeing a certain model you were waiting to be released (or whatever the case may be). That you didn\u2019t mean to be ungrateful or to show disappointment, but you knew you wouldn\u2019t get the use out of it that you would the other one and you were waiting. Recognize that how you reacted hurt her and you are sorry for that. \n\nOh and that you\u2019re really sorry for leaving and ghosting her when she was struggling to understand the situation. Definitely apologize for that. \n\nYou need some help coping with conflict, though. This isn\u2019t a normal reaction op.", "\"Hey babe, what's coming up for you, why are you crying?\"\n\nAnd then listen. \n\nAnd if either of you needs or wants a break to calm down, you can take one and then come back to the conversation. But that time is for *you* to take care of yourself and be ready to keep talking, not for you to decide how much time she \"needs\".", "Wow yeah real AH", "Haha right? \ud83e\udd23", "I'm not. I had no idea what I was doing was wrong.", "Wow you're so mature. \ud83d\ude44", "Yes I am afraid to be around someone when they are clearly emotional.", "Doubtful. Their income disparity had nothing to do with the actual situation, but he mentioned it anyways. Likely a sore spot for him.", "Ok so one of the reasons why I told her to return it was because the laptop that she bought didn't have a feature called G-Sync which is very important for the type of games I like to play. Also, the new GPU performance improvement is supposed to be HUGE. I told her to return it so she could get her money back. Idk what to tell her through text now though.", "Lol I dated a guy like this recently. It\u2019s sad seeing these grown ass men act like teenagers. Imagine running away after every minor argument and expecting a stable relationship in return lol\n\nEven if OP\u2019s gf is wrong for her reaction, does she really deserve the cold shoulder? especially after trying to get him a gift? He\u2019s literally punishing her smh. \n\nSeriously no good deed goes unpunished!", "Seriously. That is the reaction of a 13 year old.", "How so?", "When he rejected her gift he told her he isn't mad at her... like why would he be mad at her giving a gift. He turned the whole thing into this weird manipulative situation where it's become a much bigger thing than it ever should have been.", "Why?", "She has done NOTHING wrong. She bought you a laptop. You acted disappointed. Then you had a tantrum. And now you are refusing to face the truth of the matter and your part in it. This problem is entirely of your making and you are perpetuating it still, here on Reddit, and despite being called out for it you\u2019re still not taking responsibility!!\n\nYou\u2019re behaving like a child, punishing her, ignoring her, manipulating her, and gaslighting her about it.\n\nGrow up and start adulting properly. \n\nGo back to her. Apologize for reacting poorly and immaturely. Apologize for handling the situation inconsiderately. Apologize for throwing a tantrum and refusing to re-engage with her. Tell her that you know you should have - and could have - handled the situation better. Tell her you\u2019re sorry.\n\nNo \u201csorry, but\u2026\u201d\n\nNo \u201cyeah but you\u2026\u201d\n\nNo \u201cbut it\u2019s not entirely my fault\u2026\u201d\n\nAn apology with a \u201cbut\u201d is not an apology, it\u2019s an attempt to escape responsibility for your actions.\n\nYou are currently fucking this up. Stop. Change direction. Take responsibility.", "I really struggle to believe that, but I do hope it\u2019s true and you\u2019ll do better in the future.", "Yes you do, you're giving her the silent treatment, while phrasing it 'for own her good'\n\nYou're in your 30s, no one's this clueless", "She bought you a gift. You were rude and ungrateful. She became upset. You decided to hurt her by ghosting her, probably to teach her a lesson about telling you when you're out of line.", "How is it that you've been in a relationship with her for three years and still don't know how to effectively communicate or know how she needs/wants to handle a disagreement?", "Awww, thank you for saying as such, if you work hard, I'm sure one day you will be too!", "They're kind of right though. Listen to what your girlfriend is telling you. She is saying she doesn't need space and wants to talk to you and you are covering your ears saying \"la la la, you need space, I'll talk to you next week la la la!\" Good communication in a relationship also means listening and hearing what your partner is saying. \n\nWhether you mean to or not your behavior is coming across as manipulative and intentional. It really does seem like you are looking for a reason to break up with her. Like literally ignoring her attempts at communicating with you. \n\nI'm not really trying to shit on you. But this is honestly how your behavior reads as a neutral third party. \n\nAlso as a PC gamer myself, what were the specs of the laptop? Honestly depending on what was in there it might make you an even bigger asshole lol.", "Dude. You are probably the last person who needs to be insulting here.", "Why, may I ask?", "How did you make it 3 years in a relationship if you're regularly bailing out of fear your partner has feelings? \n\nYeah, it sucks to miss with a gift hard enough that you have to return it, but it's definitely not the end of the world. YTA for the silent treatment, because from the outside looking in, your lack of ability to deal with your feelings resulted in it looking like you're punishing your girlfriend emotionally for not knowing exactly what you wanted.", ">Yes I am afraid to be around someone when they are clearly emotional.\n\nYou are right. Do continue intentionally ignoring her after your childish hissy fit after being given an expensive present. Maybe she will see the light and leave your childish self. She deserves an actual adult partner, and TBH being alone is better than being ghosted and manipulated. YTA", "No one cares about the details of the laptop. We get it, she didn't get the one you wanted. Why are you ghosting her because she showed emotion?", "I don't think it's wrong for you to not be thrilled about the gift, it's mostly the reaction I take issue with. Like, I'd wait a bit before telling her if you could give it back, so you could buy your favorite. And also the ghosting and leaving the house only amplified the situation..   \n\n\nThe thank you and appreciation should've come before discussing about what you wanted instead. She might have overreacted too a little but sorry I still think you may be the bigger AH here. No offense.", "so...you not communicating is literally making it worse", "You do know the 40 Series are randomly catching fire right? It is not the time to upgrade to the 40 series. Also G-Sync isn't honestly needed. I mean I'm rocking a 1600x and a 1660 Super and still can play Elden Ring at max settings 1080p 60fps.  \n\n\nYou really don't need 4k or 144hz. It truly is not \"needed.\"", "My teenager is more emotionally available than this dude.", "Girlfriend was upset, but stated \"I don't need space.\"\nYou are ignoring her, despite her attempts to contact you.\n\nYou sound like a 17 year old who is too scared to break up with his first girlfriend.", "YTA. Not because you hurt her feelings, but because you're refusing to communicate with her.", "I don\u2019t think he actually realises that this is the behaviour that creates men who are alone at 50, wondering why no one could manage to put up with them because surely they\u2019re not that bad. These are the little things that add up to make someone feel unappreciated and undervalued day in and day out.", "Can you believe this guy?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 love this burn", "It was last year HP OMEN with the rtx 3070 ti and i7.", "Cause idk how to handle it.", "Partly cause she said she was upset with me and I was trying to let her cool off and idk what to tell her through texts", "I guess you just don't play competitive fps shooters like counter strike or don't care about how well you do. To each their own I guess \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "Idk what I should tell her though.", "That's still a beefy rig. She easily dropped close to 2 grand on that if not more. That would have set you up for like the next 5 years minimum. And the 4000 series cards are terrible value. Man. I really hope you don't torpedo your relationship over an extremely generous gift.", "So\u2026 you\u2019re an ungrateful little shit. \n\nYou make $50k a year and you\u2019re sitting here, rejecting a $2k+ gaming rig. And then you\u2019re emotionally manipulating your girlfriend about it, and acting as if you know her own emotions better than she does. She said she didn\u2019t want space, yet you\u2019ve been essentially ghosting her for days.\n\nYou don\u2019t deserve gifts. You don\u2019t deserve a girlfriend. I have *no fucking idea* how you\u2019ve managed to be in a 3 year long relationship, when you act like an emotionally ignorant, and manipulative, teenager.", "Honestly, a lot of people would sell a kidney for a machine that powerful.   \n\n\nHonestly ungrateful. You literally could have accepted it, bought the one you wanted anyways, sold the one she gave you, and if she isn't a computer nerd, she probably would have never noticed.   \n\n\nYTA: call her and communicate, ghosting is immature, then do what I suggested anyways.", "How to handle\u2026 emotions? \n\nListen, if you want to build a life with someone, being a witness to their emotions is a big freaking part of it.  That\u2019s not to say you have to tolerate emotional abuse, but it does mean that you have to support your loved one in their feelings, whether that\u2019s sadness, happiness, fear, anxiety, etc.  that\u2019s just part of being in a relationship.", "If you aren\u2019t able to be around your partner when they are experiencing big emotions, you should NOT be in a romantic relationship. \n\nPoint blank dude.", "You should not be in a relationship.", "So why did you think you deserved to build a relationship with someone if you can\u2019t do the bare minimum of handling emotions? Why aren\u2019t you single and in therapy? Why did you decide you were entitled to drag someone else down with you by pretending you were capable of having an adult relationship?", "Therapy can help with that. Emotions are normal.", "Imagine being 31 and not knowing how to handle people having emotions, including your own partner. It seems like the bigger issue here is that you need therapy OP. You can\u2019t have healthy relationships with people if you don\u2019t know how to handle emotions.", "Okay point blank, YTA. And you need to really mature emotionally before you\u2019re ready to be a proper partner.", "She didn't ask for space. She does not want space. If YOU want space you to need to communicate that like an adult. If you're struggling to communicate through text, why not see her in person?", "There is so much wrong with your responses here. Besides that, YTA, with the response you gave her when she bought you a new laptop. You sound like your games and gaming laptop are more important than your gf and her feelings. People are asking questions or posting about the situation, and you go into detail about a spec she missed when she bought you a new laptop?... in addition, your gf wants to fix the issue with her and you ignore her and leave and ghost her for several days? This sounds like a terrible situation you've created. Maybe I'm missing some context or something, but this is pretty messy, dude.", "You need to grow tf up OP. You're dating a grown women, you need to try to be a grown man. \"Idk what to tell her through texts\" is the lamest excuse ever. \n\nMature fast or she'll leave you.", "First off ... move this whole thing to r/relationshipadvice \n\nSecond \"hey, I'm sorry I responded by withdrawing. Can we try again to talk about this?\"\n\nThe problem is that you seem to think \"time to cool off\" means \"time for her feelings about this to just vanish without having to address anything\", which is not how people work.", "Actually play OW competitively, have gotten up to GM once. But counterstrike?  One of the easiest to run games in existence? I get on average 200+fps with my setup in that game.\n\nThis screams entitlement to me. This and given your other comments about not being good at handling people when they are emotional leads me to believe you lived an incredibly sheltered life growing up.", "Are you on the ASD spectrum? Because if not, youre sounding pretty manipulative and a tad narcissistic man. I cant believe shes put up with you for 3 years, YTA", "That you didn't mean to hurt her , hug her, comfort her??  Empathy?", "Do you have an autism spectrum disorder? It\u2019s the only way I can understand you being so clueless about how to handle emotions at this age.", "Literally a 2000 dollar machine. Really shameful actually. I could understand the disappointment if she got him some random outdated rig but this is still pretty high end.", "What does it matter how much fps you are getting when you say 144hz or  G-Sync doesn't matter? Youre stuck at your monitor refresh rate whether it's 60 or 75.", "I cant believe hes made it 3 years with this poor girl tbh.", "Because it's an indicator of overall performance. You are right, a lot of people get high FPS but then are bottle necked by having a monitor only capable of 60fps.   \n\n\nMy point is, you are having this stupid relationship fight over something that literally doesn't matter, and you literally do not need. Just be grateful for the gift, apologize, and learn to communicate with your SO better.   \n\n\nThen follow my advice of trading it in for the one you want anyways."]}
