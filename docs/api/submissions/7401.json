In this post the passport holder is in their home country, while in your linked post the passport holder was in a foreign country\n\nB. In the linked post the passport holder was brought to the country by the organization that the confiscator/passport thief worked for. There is an extra power dynamic that does not exist in this post. \n\nC. In this post the passport holder is related to the person who is in possession of the passport. There was (at one point) a legitimate reason for the person in possession of that passport to have that possession. In the linked post there was no family relationship and no reason (legal or otherwise) for someone else to be in possession of the passport.\n\nThese differences are important in determining what offence has been committed. In the linked post an organization brought foreign people to their country and then confiscated their government documents preventing them from returning home (or being able to access many services in the country where they are staying). That is human trafficking. \n\nHere we have a case of someone holding government documents hostage within both people\u2019s home country. This doesn\u2019t prevent the passport holder from accessing services or returning home.
