This can be something as small as editing her resume or something as big as needing a loan to make rent.  Unfortunately Lucy only has one mode, emergency.  \n\nSo whether it's a crisis or a simple problem, she always approaches it in emergency mode.  \n\nThe other day, I was in the middle of taking a timed assessment for work on my phone. I was about 5 minutes into it when Lucy called me. As I was in the middle of the assessment, I declined the call and put her into voicemail.  \n\nAs soon as I did this, she called back. I once again declined and put her into voicemail. She called back a third time and I did the same. Keeping in mind, every time she did this, it interrupted my assessment, the clock kept running, and the screen filled with her phone call taking away the question.  \n\nShe texted me, which popped up on the screen, \"911 call me.\"  \n\nI responded, \"Busy, call you in 20.\"  \n\nShe replied, \"Please, it's an emergency!\"  \n\nI closed the text, and continued my assessment. She then started calling again. I put 5 calls in a row into voicemail.  \n\nI was behind on my assessment so I tried to power through, but stress was getting to me.  \n\nLucy texted me again, \"Need you now!\"  \n\nI lost it and texted back, \"FUCK OFF!!!\"  \n\nIn 30 years neither of us has ever said that to each other but in that moment I just wanted her to leave me alone.  \n\nShe didn't respond but stopped calling me. When I finished my assessment, I called her back and she threw me into voicemail. I texted her and said was done and could talk.  \n\nShe replied, \"It's fine, I took care of it.\"  \n\nI later learned that her car had broken down and she needed a ride to work so she wouldn't miss her shift. She wound up calling her father, she was late for work, and got a written warning. She's been very cold to me and I feel very badly that I hurt her. I've apologized for cursing at her and she just says, \"It's fine,\" without any further comment. I'm beginning to doubt if my reaction was justified and feel horrible for damaging our friendship.

If her job wrote her up for one flat she\u2019s got bigger problems.  \n\nShe also could have tried others the second you weren\u2019t available.  You also have a job.  Being first call isn\u2019t same as only call.\n\nNote though, use do not disturb mode", "NTA - She could have texted 'car broke down' obviously you were busy.", "NTA: You were already at work, based on your description of Lucy, she will forgive you in time for her next emergency.", "NTA but why don\u2019t people know about silencing their phones?  This is like the third time in a week an entire drama could have been avoided if the ringer on someone\u2019s phone were off.", "NTA. Tell Lucy that she can't always ask you for everything! Did she understand that you have a life outside friends? Working and having time for yourself when needed? Didn't she learn anything on how to take care of herself in case if there is no one available to help her out? It might be time to put in some distance between Lucy and you in order to focus on YOUR own mental health. It sounds like you are having a toxic friendship with Lucy. Basically, she's trying to get you to let her walk all over you for no reasons so you could get in trouble. Please consider about putting yourself first.", "A little clarification please?  - Did she usually use this kind of tactic when in emergency mode?  calling incessantly?     You should relate the \"boy who cried wolf\" story to her.  \n\nBut honestly this is just bad communication - a text actually saying \" my car broke down and i need help\"   is better then \"911\"  and you could've taken the time with a \"im in a work thing right now that I cant walk away from for another 20 mins\"     \n\nJust have the convo with Lucy -Apologize for not being there  -explain that you wouldve if you couldve.. etc etc.   few mins of bad communication shouldnt wreck a 30 year friendship.", "NTA but you need to put some boundaries on your relationship with Lucy. I know you\u2019ve been friends for so long, and forgive me if this is out of bounds, but it just seems strange that she depends on you so much when you are not in a romantic or sexual relationship. It sounds like you\u2019re her plan for every little thing that goes wrong in her life and frankly that\u2019s just not healthy for a friendship, even a lifelong friendship. She\u2019s an adult and she needs to be able to sort her stuff out without it getting in the way of your life", "NTA", "NTA she was being annoying as hell", "Why are you friends with her? \nIf you are taking a timed assessment you should have turned your phone OFF.\nAnyway ESH because you have been enabling her and now you get mad when it is more inconvenient", "The little boy who cried wolf.

You told her you were busy, even if you had answered or knew what the issue was, you would not have been able to help her at that time. She kept calling you knowing you were busy and couldn\u2019t talk when she could\u2019ve been calling someone else to try and get a ride and avoided being late for work. Did you go a little too far by cursing at her? Probably, but you were stressed and had repeatedly made it clear that you weren\u2019t available to talk/help her and she ignored that completely.", "NTA. Lucy sounds selfish and entitled.", "NTA I hate when people call or text and don't actually say what the message is. Just say in the text the information you want me to know, don't be vague. That way I can decide if I want to contact them.", "NTB. I would have turned off my phone until the assessment was over.", "Aside from treating you like a secretarial miracle worker, is she even a decent friend? Sure doesn't sound that way.\n\nNTA. Lucy needs to put on her pull-ups and her big girl pants.", "NTA \n\nYou where busy and you have your own life, she need to respect that and accept that she will not always be first in every moment. \n\nIt may be time to rediscuss some boundaries with her and explain that her emergencies cannot always become yours.", "NTA", "A grown arsed woman at her age should know that when a call goes to voicemail or gets declined, someone is busy. You texted her as well to let her know, and she still hammered your phone. NTA for telling her to fuck off because I would have honestly done the same. The fact that she is now ignoring you proves how childish she is.", "Narrarator:  \"It was not fine\"", "NTA - She could've simply texted you what her problem was and it wasn't an actual emergency. She needs to respect you and your time.", "NTA. But you probably should have had a conversation before this about how draining she is and how you can't manage all her problems.  It sounds like she pushed you to the breaking point, and you rightfully broke.  You need to sit down and have a broader conversation about whether you can preserve this friendship which involves you putting up some really important boundaries and her respecting them.", "NTA - She prioritized her needs before yours and didn't get the cue with the forwarded calls and telling her directly that you were busy. Cursing did the trick. She should have called somebody else right away. I think you can apologize for the rudeness, but set boundaries for the future.", "NTA\n\nBut the bigger issue here is that your friend is an idiot, I don't understand how she wouldn't think to just text \"car broke down need ride to work\" since if you were ignoring her calls instead of just letting it ring you obviously were able to glance at your screen or you were even near your phone.\n\nWhat does your friend do if you just don't have your phone with you when she has an emergency?", "NTA. Crying wolf or something. Putting all eggs in one basket. Had she called her father sooner, maybe not late. Also, taxis exist.", "NTA. You were busy.

Why wasn\u2019t her father the first person she called. \nShe\u2019s used to you jumping through hoops for her to the point that now she feels you\u2019re obligated to be there for her whenever she \u201cneeds\u201d", "NTA", "NTA. My mom is a milder version of that, so I get the frustration. You guys need to have a talk about this.", "NTA - she could have got a taxi, an uber, sent a text detailing what the issue was instead of calling over and over, left a voicemail, and generally just have respected your clear signals that now was not a good time. \n\nYou say you're always there for Lucy, but is she ever there for you? The fact she pushed and pushed until you snapped then played the victim, and seems to hold her work issues against you, makes me think she's a leech and you'd see a lot less of her if you stopped jumping for her every whim.", "NTA. If it\u2019s an emergency and you aren\u2019t answering why wouldn\u2019t she text you what was wrong??? As a general rule if you call me and I don\u2019t answer, if you don\u2019t leave a voicemail or text you aren\u2019t getting a call back. I don\u2019t care if you call 1000 times, leave a message saying what is wrong. It seems sneaky to call over and over again. My sil does this and we don\u2019t answer because she\u2019s always trying to back us into a corner to do something for her. If she gets us on the phone it\u2019s harder to say no to her so we just don\u2019t even answer and don\u2019t call back unless we know why she\u2019s calling.", "NTA. Tbh, she needed to fuck off. Lucy needs a reality check that she\u2019s not the center of everyone else\u2019s universe.", "She\u2019s only your friend when she needs you.  The fact that she expected you to take time off work so you could drive her to work speaks volumes.  Stop enabling her.  This situation is entirely your fault so I\u2019m voting YTA.", "NTA. I'm around both of your ages and your friend is super immature and codependent. She also seems totally histrionic and unreliable. Does she ever do anything for you or are you always responding to every little thing that happens to her as if it's the worst thing ever?\n\nI had someone like that in my life, and I cut them off entirely. I cannot deal with someone stressing out like someone is dying over minor things that I would just take care of myself and then forget an hour later.\n\nIt really drove it home to me once when she called me in hysterics that her car battery was dead and she had a doctor's appointment she was going to miss. This person is an adult, and not a young one. I was about to go into trial (I'm a lawyer) and it almost threw me off my game.\n\nThat's when I knew that person was not bringing anything but incredible stress to my life. If my car battery was dead, I would just have a neighbor jump it to get to where I absolutely had to be, or, if I didn't have somewhere to be immediately, I'd call roadside assistance and have someone come replace it within an hour or two.\n\nAfter trial, and basically gaslighting myself into forgetting that she ever called me and then *called me horrible names* when I told her to take care of it herself, I realized what a rube I had been. This woman doesn't have a job, she's wealthy, and she's useless. She did nothing but use me and then abuse me as soon as I was not giving her attention.\n\nSound familiar? You really need to have a come-to-Jesus with your friend and, if she can't respect your boundaries, cut her off.", "Lucy is the girl who cried wolf. NTA.", "NTA, your friend needs adulthood training.", "OP, she doesn\u2019t have any right to expect you to stop what you\u2019re doing and come to her when she calls, what she\u2019s doing is very rude and you explained that you were working on something and couldn\u2019t help her at that time, besides, it wasn\u2019t even that big of an emergency, she could\u2019ve called roadside assistance and then call her job and say that she was going to be late because her car broke down.\n\nNTA, even though I don\u2019t agree with you cursing at her, I do think that your friend is very clingy to you and that\u2019s something she needs to work on, it also sounds like she might have abandonment issues as well, the only thing I can fault you for is that you haven\u2019t set up some boundaries with her yet, I mean, she\u2019s an adult and can\u2019t expect you to come at her beck and call.", "NTA. It wasn't a 911. It was an inconvenience. \n\nIt sounds like a toxic relationship in which she just uses you. Move on dude. She's not a friend.", "NTA\n\nLucy needs to learn to take a hint.

You need to set boundaries such that she can't expect you to just drop everything to help here at a moment's notice.\n\nIf you want my honest opinion, Lucy isn't really your friend. She only views you as a lifeguard while she's the toddler that keeps jumping into the pool without a lifevest and can't swim.

Sure, but after getting sent to voicemail 2 times in a row. She should have called the next person.", "ESH. She sucks because you said you were busy and she kept bothering you.

Then she could\u2019ve dialed her dad or Uber. \n\nYou\u2019ve put up with this \u201ccrisis of the day\u201d mode for 30 years? You need to start doing some reading on setting boundaries, and how to stick to them. \n\nWill you lose your \u201cfriend?\u201d Maybe. Hopefully, because she\u2019s become accustomed to you revolving around her and treating her as if she\u2019s more important than your own needs. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. I would\u2019ve told her where to go after the third call.", "NTA and friendships/relationships go both ways.  She needs to appreciate you had your own important priorities at the time and couldn't drop everything and sacrifice your work life to help her deal with hers.", "NTA so if I understand well, she wanted you to leave your work to go pick her up and bring her to work ? Why your job is supposed to be less important ? Does she knew you were at work ? Why in hell does she feel so entilted to your time ? \n\nWould love to here her answer....", "NTA has she even apologised for her completely OTT behaviour? Seems perhaps not and she is digging in and making you the bad guy. Don\u2019t fall for it.", "NTA. You can\u2019t expect someone to be available all them time. If you were working would you have been able to drop everything to take her to work? Is she frequently late to work? Seems a bit harsh an employer would give you a written warning for being late as a 1 off.", "NTA, but this doesn't sound like a healthy dynamic at all. You need to have a talk with Lucy.  Let her know that you care about her, but other people have lives too and some things can't be placed on hold for her emergencies unless it's a life-or-death situation (she had an accident and is bleeding out kind of issue).  If she sees you've seen her call but sent it to voicemail, it means you are busy.  Period.  You will get back to her, but bombing your phone is weird and rude.  She needs to knock it off or you need to distance yourself from her.", "NTA.", "NTA From how this reads, this has been a long time coming. This gal is not a friend, she\u2019s a user who takes advantage of people and expects everyone to be at her every beck and call. At her age she would fully understand that people can\u2019t just drop their lives to do things for her. You had every right to tell her to fuck off. You deserve better friends.", "NTA.. \n\n>I've apologized for cursing at her\n\nYou've done your part in this. And now it's her turn. \n\n\n>She's been very cold to me \n\nMaybe she'll use this opportunity to actually grow up and understand even you have important things in life and can't just keep magically appearing like a genie to help her out everytime. \n\nDon't think you need to take any disrespect from her over this. She's almost 40 and should have learned how to take care of a car break down by now or at least exhibit the common sense that when someone ignores your phone calls 5 times and even texts you that he is busy, that's when you call someone else..", "NTA. Males shouldn't be friends with Females this way.", "She\u2019s 38. She not your wife. She\u2019s not your problem. NTA", "NTA.\n\nBut also, put your phone on do not disturb and it'll 'hide' notifications from popping up and taking up the whole screen until you take it off. Just something to know next time.", "NTA.\n\nI have a similar friend.  We've been friends for 41 years now.\n\nShe still does not have her life together, and calls when she needs things or when she wants to give herself a pity-party.", "NTA. She needs to grow up and learn to fix her own problems.", "NTA \n\nShe sounds exhausting.  \n\nGood of you to be her go-to person 24/7, but when has she been there for you?   \n\nYou needed her to leave you alone for a few minutes and she couldn't comprehend that fact.  \n\nShe sounds like a user, and a spoiled one at that.  \n\nShe's the boy who cried wolf.    She has filled your friendship with SOSes for years and everything being an emergency for herl  she blew her ability for you to take her seriously.", "NTAH this was important but not a real emergency. She wasn\u2019t stranded on a dark road in the middle of nowhere. Your work should come first. This seems like a \u201ccry wolf\u201d story. She\u2019ll know better now not to make trivial stuff seem like an emergency. I find it interesting that she called you so many times before she thought about trying her own father. You apologized for texting \u201c fuck off\u201d. That is the only thing you did wrong, but it is understandable how you could have lost your temper. Not to mention that nothing else worked, when you were polite, she ignored you.", "NTA. Why is her work more important than yours?", "No, not at all. The only problem i see on your side, is you failed.to set boundaries early on, and enabled thia behavior.", "NTA but I suggest you try and have a chat with her about boundaries and space.  I am not very good at taking subtle hints, but I would probably get that one.", "NTA. You can not be there for 24/7 for every little emergency. Idk if she knew you would be busy and unavailable at that time but she should have taken the hint the first time she got sent to voice mail. One of these she's gonna have to realize you can't solve all her problems for her.", "NTA You can\u2019t help her with everything. But you should\u2019ve set boundaries earlier. Also why didn\u2019t she just tell you her car broke down after you ignored her phone calls or ask someone else?\n\nWait mb I forgot you said she approaches things in emergency.", "Boundaries are important. The reason why this is an issue is because you\u2019ve never stated them to her. You drop everything for her \u2018emergencies\u2019 knowing they almost always aren\u2019t. \n\nNTA\n\nBut once she cools off learn to communicate. She\u2019s your friend, not your S/O. And even if she was, she obviously doesn\u2019t respect you or your time.", "NTA\nIt really wasn't an emergency that she needed a ride to work. If she needed that ride immediately, you telling her you were busy at that moment should have been enough to tell her to ask someone else.", "NTA but in the time you wrote call in twenty, you could have put your phone on Do Not Disturb or something. Let her cool off now you've explained yourself. Hopefully she'll see what you were doing was important and come round once she stops feeling slighted. It would be a good time to discuss boundaries going forward, though.", "NTA. but oh boy you have 30 years of some poor habits to change. You had a valid reason and her expecting you to drop everything for her is ridiculous, but it seems you usually do just that. She solved the problem on her own and the best thing you can do for your friendship is to encourage her to continue doing just that. Doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be there as a friend or in a true emergency.", "NTA.  \n\nI'm trying to understand her thought process.  If you had dropped what you were doing to fix her immediate need, it would have helped her.  But it also would have hurt you.\n\nHer job isn't more important than yours.  If she had tried her dad the first time you didn't take the call, then he may have gotten her to work on time.  \n\nHer insistence about needing YOUR help only ended up giving you both a problem.   \n\nIt sounds like she has some life lessons to learn.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't damage your friendship any more than she already damaged it by designing her entire life around the expectation that you will solve all of her problems.", "Nta. She has no right to expect you to jump every time she calls. She should have called her dad after he first call to reach you went to voice mail.  After her second call you should have turned off your phone. You were at work.  She is the ahole for contacting you repeatedly  at work.  You should not have apologized.  This is all on here. People will continue to use you as a servant if you let them. Stop being  her doormat.  Grow a spine.  She deserved to be told to fuck off. She could have left a message about her car but decided to insist you answer your phone. Your phone you decide when to use it.  Not her.", "NTA, and I would have put my phone on airplane mode so I can focus in peace. Also she\u2019s kinda an AH considering she had an alternative solution to her problem but refused to accept you could not speak to her right then and there.", "NTA, but SHE IS. Uber exists. Her work does NOT prevail over your work. You are adults, not children.", "NTA. 911 call me? For a car break down. Is she serious? She was solely relying on you to help her before being told off.\n\nI'd suggest sitting her down and talking about this problem of making minor bs an emergency.", "NTA. She needs to find other ways to cope, you were busy with work, she can\u2019t expect for you to drop everything every time she has a problem. If she just wants your friendship for what she gets from you she is not a friend.", "Boundaries how many of us have them..", "Next time you\u2019re doing an assessment put your phone on do not disturb. \ud83d\ude0a", "Your only the AH you haven\u2019t yet told her you were in the middle of a timed assessment.  Once you\u2019ve apologized for telling her to fuck off, it\u2019s up to her to realize it\u2019s not that big a deal. She got a ride after all.", "NTA.\n\nSure, being told to fuck off doesn't feel good. But some people need to understand that the world doesn't revolve around them.\n\nIf you call someone once or twice and they decline, get the hint. They're busy. Needing a ride to work does not constitute an emergency. Get an Uber.", "She should have just texted you about the situation.", "NTA But you should put your phone on do not disturb or silent when you are unavailable.", "Doesn't sound like a friend if they only reach out when they need something from you", "NTA - just reading this gave me hives. In the future, don\u2019t respond at all until you\u2019re free. Or put your phone on silent", "NTA. \n\nWe can't all expect everyone to just drop everything because we think our needs are more important than someone else's. Sucks her car broke down, but you're not the only person in her life that can help when needs arise. She could've called AAA, any tow company, called work first and explained her car broke down and she maybe late, or her father after the first time you responded you are busy.", "NTA", "if someone calls multiple times while on do not disturb the call comes through", "In this case, silencing his phone wouldn't have helped. He was doing his assessment on his phone, so even if it was silenced, it would still pop up on screen and disturb the assessment.", "Why don't people know about reading the post before they comment?", "Turning the ringer off wouldn't stop the call from popping up over the assessment, but DND mode would.", "He was using his phone to do the assessment", "I don't disagree with you overall, but OP says they were doing the assessment on their phone so turning it off wasn't really an option.", "NTA! Yup! She could have mentioned she was stranded and needed a ride.  911 emergency is not a proper text message. On the other hand,  OP should have put phone on DND or silent after the first call.", "So, he should interrupt something he was doing that was time sensitive rather than her having to accept that it's not his responsibility to immediately drop everything the moment she calls? Nah, fuck that. She's a horrible self centered person and not someone that'd I'd ever call a friend.", "I disagree. If after a text saying they're busy and being sent to voicemail 8 times, Lucy should have gotten the hint that OP isn't in a position to help. OP tried to be polite, but after so many times a person's patience is going to wear down and the only way someone like Lucy is going to get the message is being told to fuck off. Sometimes that's the last resort and the only option to really get a message across.", "how is she supposed to explain, whilst doing an assessment?", "No! The other person was being unreasonable. OP was not their only option for help, they said they were busy, the person should have stopped harassing OP. Or they could have said in the message what the emergency was. OP is still under no obligation to answer the phone or help the \"friend.\" Their emergency does not mean OP has to drop everything.", "I hate Lucy just reading this. What part of I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW AND CALLING BACK A BUNCH OF TIMES WON'T HELP THAT can she not understand? I get that that was dire for her and ended in bad consequences, but not everyone is available to you at any time they need you. \n\nHonestly, if the friendship ends over this, it might very well be a relief.", "yeah, and even if op were her mother, the woman is 38 years old. she can\u2019t figure out that op has his own job and he can\u2019t put his entire life on hold because she had car trouble? why didn\u2019t she call her father in the first place? why didn\u2019t she call her job and tell them the situation? why didn\u2019t she call a cab??? so many options. and instead she\u2019s acting like op is supposed to drop everything, to his own detriment, because she has a problem. nope. should he have told her to fuck off? probably not. should he have paused his timed assessment to walk her through her options like she\u2019s five? hell no. should op have dropped his work assignment to drive her to work? absolutely not. would she have stopped calling and interrupting if op hadn\u2019t said that to her? you know, it kind of seems like she wouldn\u2019t have. so maybe it was the best thing to do. bottom line, she needs some boundaries, cause her inconvenience cannot be op\u2019s emergency forever.\n\neta: this entire rant and somehow i forgot: nta.", "Sounds like the assessment was on the phone, but yes, do not disturb for sure", "I agree with using DND mode as a precaution In the future, but it's worth noting that I don't think it would have worked here, because most phones have a function where if the same number calls multiple times in a short period it overrides the DND mode", "DND after 3rd call - definitely the way to go. I never think of it, but it's so easy to get to (at least on my android).", "She was using the phone to do the assessment. She can't turn it off.", "They were completing the assessment on the phone.", "He was doing the assessment on his phone. When someone calls or texts it covers all or part of the screen. DND mode may be your friend OP.", "[removed]", "Right, sounds like this has been a one sided friendship for 30 years", "He *was* working. Lucy seems to think he should risk his job so she does get in trouble at hers. She had a bunch of other options, including just calling a freaking Uber. But that requires behaving like a grown up.", "Actually, it probably wouldn't have got her to work on time even if OP drove over to pick her up straight away. She was obviously already running late when she called, and so any time taken to get to her location would likely have been too much. She should have just called her boss and told them what was going on and (possibly) avoided the right up, then found a ride.", "He was doing the assessment on his phone so couldn\u2019t have turned it off", "Why couldn\u2019t she just text the problem??", "This is exactly what I was thinking. Yea a breakdown is annoying, especially when you\u2019re late for work\u2026.but it\u2019s hardly a 911 call, c\u2019mon!\n\nNTA", "This! Especially in your late 30s \ud83d\ude43", "This is why you don\u2019t bother with dnd. You simply silence the thing and don\u2019t look at it.", "Well in this case, \"do not disturb\" is the move, not just silencing.", "Well, apparently not for long enough according to another comment so I guess this poor guy is just shit out of luck.", "I wouldn\u2019t go that far, but I agree that if he\u2019s busy she should understand and look elsewhere for help since they\u2019re just friends", "\u201cCar broke down, help\u201d is what she could\u2019ve said at first.\nAlso did you mean he? If so then you could still type a detailed reply under a minute like \u201csorry I\u2019m busy doing as assessment, ttyl\u201d", "It is very unlikely the assessment was only available thru mobile", "OP is a guy.", "Point taken. In that case, route the friend to VM permanently.", "OP is male", "True!", "I was literally thinking this! \n\nA quick \u201cmy car brown down, can you help?\u201d Would have been more helpful instead of beating around the bush.", "He was on his phone doing the assessment, so he had to be looking at it.", "That's not a functional solution here, if you read the post.", "She should have taken the hint that he was busy when he sent her to voicemail 8 times. She\u2019s not his wife. Might be harsh but Lucy is a grown woman and she shouldn\u2019t make every backup plan in her life depend on OP answering the phone. Not healthy", "OP did say busy 20 min.", "So it's OP's responsibility to explain why he can't help instead of Lucy accepting that OP is not in a position to help? If I'm in a time-sensitive assessment that is important to my job, I don't have time to write out why I'm busy to someone instead of them just accepting I'm busy with something important.", "That doesn't really matter if OP was already taking the assessment on his phone, he can't exactly close a timed assessment and open it back up on a computer. It's not as if he knew she would pull this, he's not wrong for taking the assessment on his phone. I agree with the advice to use DND in the future, but really no one should have to expect this level level of disturbance.", "On some phones you can set a DND mode without turning off the phone.", "Agreed", "True, I see where I\u2019m wrong"]}
