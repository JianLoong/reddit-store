This can be something as small as editing her resume or something as big as needing a loan to make rent.  Unfortunately Lucy only has one mode, emergency.  \n\nSo whether it's a crisis or a simple problem, she always approaches it in emergency mode.  \n\nThe other day, I was in the middle of taking a timed assessment for work on my phone. I was about 5 minutes into it when Lucy called me. As I was in the middle of the assessment, I declined the call and put her into voicemail.  \n\nAs soon as I did this, she called back. I once again declined and put her into voicemail. She called back a third time and I did the same. Keeping in mind, every time she did this, it interrupted my assessment, the clock kept running, and the screen filled with her phone call taking away the question.  \n\nShe texted me, which popped up on the screen, \"911 call me.\"  \n\nI responded, \"Busy, call you in 20.\"  \n\nShe replied, \"Please, it's an emergency!\"  \n\nI closed the text, and continued my assessment. She then started calling again. I put 5 calls in a row into voicemail.  \n\nI was behind on my assessment so I tried to power through, but stress was getting to me.  \n\nLucy texted me again, \"Need you now!\"  \n\nI lost it and texted back, \"FUCK OFF!!!\"  \n\nIn 30 years neither of us has ever said that to each other but in that moment I just wanted her to leave me alone.  \n\nShe didn't respond but stopped calling me. When I finished my assessment, I called her back and she threw me into voicemail. I texted her and said was done and could talk.  \n\nShe replied, \"It's fine, I took care of it.\"  \n\nI later learned that her car had broken down and she needed a ride to work so she wouldn't miss her shift. She wound up calling her father, she was late for work, and got a written warning. She's been very cold to me and I feel very badly that I hurt her. I've apologized for cursing at her and she just says, \"It's fine,\" without any further comment. I'm beginning to doubt if my reaction was justified and feel horrible for damaging our friendship.

If her job wrote her up for one flat she\u2019s got bigger problems.  \n\nShe also could have tried others the second you weren\u2019t available.  You also have a job.  Being first call isn\u2019t same as only call.\n\nNote though, use do not disturb mode", "NTA - She could have texted 'car broke down' obviously you were busy.", "NTA: You were already at work, based on your description of Lucy, she will forgive you in time for her next emergency.", "NTA but why don\u2019t people know about silencing their phones?  This is like the third time in a week an entire drama could have been avoided if the ringer on someone\u2019s phone were off.", "NTA. Tell Lucy that she can't always ask you for everything! Did she understand that you have a life outside friends? Working and having time for yourself when needed? Didn't she learn anything on how to take care of herself in case if there is no one available to help her out? It might be time to put in some distance between Lucy and you in order to focus on YOUR own mental health. It sounds like you are having a toxic friendship with Lucy. Basically, she's trying to get you to let her walk all over you for no reasons so you could get in trouble. Please consider about putting yourself first.", "A little clarification please?  - Did she usually use this kind of tactic when in emergency mode?  calling incessantly?     You should relate the \"boy who cried wolf\" story to her.  \n\nBut honestly this is just bad communication - a text actually saying \" my car broke down and i need help\"   is better then \"911\"  and you could've taken the time with a \"im in a work thing right now that I cant walk away from for another 20 mins\"     \n\nJust have the convo with Lucy -Apologize for not being there  -explain that you wouldve if you couldve.. etc etc.   few mins of bad communication shouldnt wreck a 30 year friendship.", "NTA but you need to put some boundaries on your relationship with Lucy. I know you\u2019ve been friends for so long, and forgive me if this is out of bounds, but it just seems strange that she depends on you so much when you are not in a romantic or sexual relationship. It sounds like you\u2019re her plan for every little thing that goes wrong in her life and frankly that\u2019s just not healthy for a friendship, even a lifelong friendship. She\u2019s an adult and she needs to be able to sort her stuff out without it getting in the way of your life", "NTA", "NTA she was being annoying as hell", "Why are you friends with her? \nIf you are taking a timed assessment you should have turned your phone OFF.\nAnyway ESH because you have been enabling her and now you get mad when it is more inconvenient", "The little boy who cried wolf.

You told her you were busy, even if you had answered or knew what the issue was, you would not have been able to help her at that time. She kept calling you knowing you were busy and couldn\u2019t talk when she could\u2019ve been calling someone else to try and get a ride and avoided being late for work. Did you go a little too far by cursing at her? Probably, but you were stressed and had repeatedly made it clear that you weren\u2019t available to talk/help her and she ignored that completely.", "NTA. Lucy sounds selfish and entitled.", "NTA I hate when people call or text and don't actually say what the message is. Just say in the text the information you want me to know, don't be vague. That way I can decide if I want to contact them.", "NTB. I would have turned off my phone until the assessment was over.", "Aside from treating you like a secretarial miracle worker, is she even a decent friend? Sure doesn't sound that way.\n\nNTA. Lucy needs to put on her pull-ups and her big girl pants.", "NTA \n\nYou where busy and you have your own life, she need to respect that and accept that she will not always be first in every moment. \n\nIt may be time to rediscuss some boundaries with her and explain that her emergencies cannot always become yours.", "NTA", "A grown arsed woman at her age should know that when a call goes to voicemail or gets declined, someone is busy. You texted her as well to let her know, and she still hammered your phone. NTA for telling her to fuck off because I would have honestly done the same. The fact that she is now ignoring you proves how childish she is.", "Narrarator:  \"It was not fine\"", "NTA - She could've simply texted you what her problem was and it wasn't an actual emergency. She needs to respect you and your time.", "NTA. But you probably should have had a conversation before this about how draining she is and how you can't manage all her problems.  It sounds like she pushed you to the breaking point, and you rightfully broke.  You need to sit down and have a broader conversation about whether you can preserve this friendship which involves you putting up some really important boundaries and her respecting them.", "NTA - She prioritized her needs before yours and didn't get the cue with the forwarded calls and telling her directly that you were busy. Cursing did the trick. She should have called somebody else right away. I think you can apologize for the rudeness, but set boundaries for the future.", "NTA\n\nBut the bigger issue here is that your friend is an idiot, I don't understand how she wouldn't think to just text \"car broke down need ride to work\" since if you were ignoring her calls instead of just letting it ring you obviously were able to glance at your screen or you were even near your phone.\n\nWhat does your friend do if you just don't have your phone with you when she has an emergency?", "NTA. Crying wolf or something. Putting all eggs in one basket. Had she called her father sooner, maybe not late. Also, taxis exist.", "NTA. You were busy. It\u2019s not your fault that she got into trouble. I\u2019m wondering if she would help you out of the situation we\u2019re in reverse", "NTA. Why wasn\u2019t her father the first person she called. \nShe\u2019s used to you jumping through hoops for her to the point that now she feels you\u2019re obligated to be there for her whenever she \u201cneeds\u201d", "NTA", "NTA. My mom is a milder version of that, so I get the frustration. You guys need to have a talk about this.", "NTA - she could have got a taxi, an uber, sent a text detailing what the issue was instead of calling over and over, left a voicemail, and generally just have respected your clear signals that now was not a good time. \n\nYou say you're always there for Lucy, but is she ever there for you? The fact she pushed and pushed until you snapped then played the victim, and seems to hold her work issues against you, makes me think she's a leech and you'd see a lot less of her if you stopped jumping for her every whim.", "NTA. If it\u2019s an emergency and you aren\u2019t answering why wouldn\u2019t she text you what was wrong??? As a general rule if you call me and I don\u2019t answer, if you don\u2019t leave a voicemail or text you aren\u2019t getting a call back. I don\u2019t care if you call 1000 times, leave a message saying what is wrong. It seems sneaky to call over and over again. My sil does this and we don\u2019t answer because she\u2019s always trying to back us into a corner to do something for her. If she gets us on the phone it\u2019s harder to say no to her so we just don\u2019t even answer and don\u2019t call back unless we know why she\u2019s calling.", "NTA. Tbh, she needed to fuck off. Lucy needs a reality check that she\u2019s not the center of everyone else\u2019s universe.", "She\u2019s only your friend when she needs you.  The fact that she expected you to take time off work so you could drive her to work speaks volumes.  Stop enabling her.  This situation is entirely your fault so I\u2019m voting YTA.", "NTA. I'm around both of your ages and your friend is super immature and codependent. She also seems totally histrionic and unreliable. Does she ever do anything for you or are you always responding to every little thing that happens to her as if it's the worst thing ever?\n\nI had someone like that in my life, and I cut them off entirely. I cannot deal with someone stressing out like someone is dying over minor things that I would just take care of myself and then forget an hour later.\n\nIt really drove it home to me once when she called me in hysterics that her car battery was dead and she had a doctor's appointment she was going to miss. This person is an adult, and not a young one. I was about to go into trial (I'm a lawyer) and it almost threw me off my game.\n\nThat's when I knew that person was not bringing anything but incredible stress to my life. If my car battery was dead, I would just have a neighbor jump it to get to where I absolutely had to be, or, if I didn't have somewhere to be immediately, I'd call roadside assistance and have someone come replace it within an hour or two.\n\nAfter trial, and basically gaslighting myself into forgetting that she ever called me and then *called me horrible names* when I told her to take care of it herself, I realized what a rube I had been. This woman doesn't have a job, she's wealthy, and she's useless. She did nothing but use me and then abuse me as soon as I was not giving her attention.\n\nSound familiar? You really need to have a come-to-Jesus with your friend and, if she can't respect your boundaries, cut her off.", "Lucy is the girl who cried wolf. NTA.", "NTA, your friend needs adulthood training.", "OP, she doesn\u2019t have any right to expect you to stop what you\u2019re doing and come to her when she calls, what she\u2019s doing is very rude and you explained that you were working on something and couldn\u2019t help her at that time, besides, it wasn\u2019t even that big of an emergency, she could\u2019ve called roadside assistance and then call her job and say that she was going to be late because her car broke down.\n\nNTA, even though I don\u2019t agree with you cursing at her, I do think that your friend is very clingy to you and that\u2019s something she needs to work on, it also sounds like she might have abandonment issues as well, the only thing I can fault you for is that you haven\u2019t set up some boundaries with her yet, I mean, she\u2019s an adult and can\u2019t expect you to come at her beck and call.", "NTA. It wasn't a 911. It was an inconvenience. \n\nIt sounds like a toxic relationship in which she just uses you. Move on dude. She's not a friend.", "NTA\n\nLucy needs to learn to take a hint.

You need to set boundaries such that she can't expect you to just drop everything to help here at a moment's notice.\n\nIf you want my honest opinion, Lucy isn't really your friend. She only views you as a lifeguard while she's the toddler that keeps jumping into the pool without a lifevest and can't swim.

Sure, but after getting sent to voicemail 2 times in a row. She should have called the next person.", "ESH. She sucks because you said you were busy and she kept bothering you.

Don't get me wrong, we got along like a house on fire until she started using me for absolutely anything and everything and would call me in hysterics over petty little things she could easily have taken care of herself. It took me way too long to admit I'd had enough of that, I talked to her honestly about this and its amazing how quickly she went quiet towards me after I politely told her that I'll help when I can with something big but she needs to get shit done herself at times just like the rest of us. Cut your ties my guy", "NTA where was her apology for the unrelenting phone calls when you had said that you were busy?", "NTA as a lot of other commenters have said, but I think you need to understand what's happening in a different way.\n\nThis is a form of boundary crossing by her.  You have not clearly enough set boundaries with her.  Even where you have, she is using \"emergency mode\" to brush past them.  Every time you do respond to her, she gets what she wants.  In the rare instance where you don't, she escalates with further urgency until she ultimately gets a response. \n\nIn this case, not the response she was looking for, but -- and this is important -- still a good one for her to continue to manipulate you with.  Because she pushed you and pushed you until you exploded, and now you feel bad, and so now she gets to act like you're the bad guy.  And as a bonus, you are probably less likely to ignore her next time.\n\nThe way to manage someone like this, aside from potentially removing her from your life entirely, is to be incredibly clear with your boundaries, and then follow through resolutely on your promises if she doesn't respect them.  Things like, \"if I don't answer the first call, please don't call again, as I might be doing something important.  If you do, I'll have to block you.\"  Or, \"You often tell me things are emergencies that aren't.  In the future, you can text me what the actual situation is, otherwise I'm not going to respond to a generic '911' text.\"", "NTA. She needs to learn to problem solve in times you aren\u2019t available. This was one of those times. You can\u2019t be there 24/7. It just isn\u2019t humanly possible.", "NTA - After the 2nd rejected call, it should have been obvious that you weren't in a position to help her right then, no matter what the emergency was! She had her Dad to fall back on, and while its a shame she got written up, she also had a negative impact on YOUR work and you're not freezing her out.\n\nShe sounds overly dependent on you, and a touch narcissistic.", "Had the same kind of \"friendship\" going on before I wised up. Life is so much more peaceful without these kinds of people. NTA.", "NTA\nBut you need to have a serious conversation about boundaries.  \nIf you say you'll call back, do so.  And it also means you can not pick up right now. \nIf she can't see her emergencies don't override your life whenever, she's not a friend.", "NTA, I have a friend who always think her cluster fuck of a life is everyone else's emergency. It's tiring, she should have respected your time better, she did not until she pushed you too far and she figured it out. Wonder why Dad wasn't her first call? Bet I know why.", "NTA I feel like maybe it's time she learned she can't rely *solely* on you. You have your own life and your own things that need to be taken care of, she can't always expect you to drop everything and run to her aid.", "NTA, surely when she heard you were doing a timed work assessment she would realise it want appropriate to call that many times.\n\nMaybe a meet up for food or soemthing to chat it over woukd work.", "Lucy sounds exhausting. \n\nHow you\u2019ve lasted 30 years is astounding. A testament to your patience or, I\u2019m afraid, your doormat nature. \n\nExplain very clearly to Lucy how you ended up at that F off cross roads: \n\n* Lucy cries wolf all the time \n* Thus you have no idea if it\u2019s a true emergency or not\n* You were taking a timed assessment that she screwed up each time she called. She royally screwed you over. \n\nSo she was late for work and written up. I\u2019m guessing she would have been regardless of if you or her dad helped. \n\nYou did far worse on your assessment than you could have done \u2014 a direct result of HER continued interference and borderline harassment. \n\nNTA for ignoring her. \n\nI don\u2019t know about the F off part.

You were busy, and your time doesn\u2019t just belong to her whenever she wants it.", "You have helped her way too much. I wouldn't dream of demanding help from my friends like this.", "Smh. That\u2019s just incredibly unnecessary behavior from her. It may have felt harsh but she got the message b/c clearly nothing else was working. NTA", "NTA. Tell me, is Lucy familiar with \u201cthe boy who cried wolf\u201d?", "NTA. Crying wolf shot her in the foot, but I'd sit her down and talk that over with her so she's more likely to have learned her lesson. \"I am sorry you felt abandoned by me, but after treating minor things as emergencies for so long, I didn't anticipate that it would really be an emergency this time.\"\n\nAlso, why the hell did you have to save her? If her dad was an option, what the fuck is she doing pushing the issue with you? I have a feeling you should've set some boundaries long ago, but that's neither here nor there at this point.", "NTA, if she only reaches out to you when she needs something and feels like her needs/life is more important than yours.....she is not a friend!", "NTA. Clearly if someone doesn\u2019t answer your phone call after the first couple of times, then that likely means they\u2019re unable to pick up for whatever reason, and Lucy didn\u2019t really seem to care that you might be busy. Not to mention, did she really not have anyone else to contact *first* other than you? \n\nYes, you could have texted that you were doing a timed assessment that you couldn\u2019t step away from, BUT to be fair, Lucy also didn\u2019t actually tell you what the emergency was and seemed to expect you to just drop what you were doing to run over to her.", "NTA.

If you can't do anything for them, then what use are you.\n\nYou may be okay with apologizing profusely for this 1 indiscretion, but if she doesn't want to forgive you for having to live your life as well, then now you can actually see how you are being used by this person.\n\nHopefully, it can be resolved between you to your satisfaction, I doubt it as she will probably make you pay for not being available exactly when she needed you every single time.\n\nGood luck and hopefully you have other friends who can help you fill this impending void.", "NTA, sounds like you\u2019ve been always there for her and now you told her to fuck off.. so what? One mishap.. you do one thing wrong and you deserve punishment when you have been there for her 30 years?\nBut you do need to set boundaries. This is not appropriate and respectful behaviour. Sit down with her and have a real conversation. It will be a hard pill to shallow but I hope eventually you\u2019ll find each other again in a healthier framework", "NTA - I believe most phones have a \"do not disturb\" mode that wouldn't let amy calls come through to you. Probably worth having a conversation with Lucy about what is and is not an emergency - or having a specific thing - code word - that means \"I am unable to help right now\"", "I would set up a auto response of at work , or busy and just have it on when you need it. Then it wouldn\u2019t interfere with test.", "NTA Sometimes you have to say fuck off to make a point. You're dealing with the boy who cried wolf, and this is another fake cry. When you didn't answer, she should have called her dad. You weren't available even if you had answered the phone and not said fuck off. The fact that she was late and written up isn't on you.", "NTA. You told her you were busy, she had other people she could\u2019ve called and obviously wasted time trying to call you after you told her you were busy. She was putting her needs above your own, even though it was very clear you couldn\u2019t help her at that time. You handled this better than I probably would have honestly", "NTA it sounds like you need to establish some healthy boundaries with her. She should not be expecting you to drop everything every time she has an \u201cemergency\u201d. You have a life and responsibilities too. I would apologize for swearing but that\u2019s about it.", "NTA.  After the 2nd go to vm, she shod have sent a text explaining & found another ride.  She was able to get another ride so she just zeroed in on you as the person to save her.  It's fine you did this so stop feeling guilty, no matter how she treats you & hopefully she will respect you in the future.  Also, she needs to learn that her \"emergencies\" aren't anyone but hers & no one else has to help.  I'm guessing that you help her a lot & she frequently uses you as the solution.  She doesn't seem to understand that you have a life and you have to put yourself first.  If she can't understand this & just makes you feel guilty & sulks then the friendship is 1 sided.  Do not let her getaway with this.  Stop apologizing as if you were at fault.  The most I would apologize is, sorry I was busy when you needed help.", "NTA. She could\u2019ve sent a text saying \u201cmy car broke down, can you help?\u201d You telling her that you were busy and would call her right back should\u2019ve been enough.", "NTA \u2026 your so called friend needs a reality check, her car broke down, her issue, she was going to be late for work, but she had time to blow up your phone, she could have got a cab, Uber, her dad to drive her in that time frame\u2026 you are not standing by waiting to be of service to her.   She\u2019s not your friend, she is using you.", "NTA. Unfortunately you have made it so that she relies on you to bail her out. She does not respect your situations or boundaries. You told her you couldn\u2019t talk and she did not care about you, only her own \u201cemergency\u201d. Yes, this time it was an emergency but you know the story of the boy who cried wolf\u2026.  I would apologize one more time, let her know that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to help even if you could answer the phone. Its her decision to get over it!", "NTA. While there could have been a better reaction than snapping, it's completely understandable given the circumstances, and you did apologize afterwards. Clearly you recognize where you went wrong, but she doesnt seem to, which speaks to a deeper problem.\n\nIt seems that this relationship has serious boundary issues that need to be addressed, otherwise it will either dissolve in a very unhealthy way or eat you alive. It also sounds like she has trouble regulating her emotions, and while you can't control how she handles this, you can control your response to it. Giving in to her every whim won't help either of you, it just reinforces her unhealthy reaction to stress and sets a dynamic where she expects you to be available 24/7, because in her experience, you have been. This is not sustainable though, and you both need to understand this.\n\nI know where you're coming from, I've had relationships where there was a massive lack of boundaries and it was expected that I would drop everything for them at any given time.\n\nThe thing about relationships with no boundaries is that it's usually a two way street. While there's some degree of common sense to be had for knowing when you've majorly crossed a line that you shouldn't really have to tell people, relationships like this don't generally exist without you allowing the person walking all over you. You need to learn to set boundaries outside of situations of what she perceives to be an emergency, otherwise she will keep thinking this sort of behavior is acceptable.\n\nOne thing that really helped me was reading the book Set Boundaries, Find Peace by Nedra Glover Tawwab. A lot of us tend to set boundaries in our own mind with others, but fail to communicate them properly. This helps no one and generally leads to frustration and strife. This book helped me not only learn how to set them in my own life, but how to handle it when the person doesnt take it well (as is often the case when it comes to enmeshed relationships like this).", "NTA. The \u201cfuck off\u201d was likely hurtful and I can understand that from her perspective. But you also have to look out for your well-being and if this was a work related task that time needs to be respected. Does your phone has a Do not disturb mode? For future purposes. \n\nGive your friend some time and space and hopefully you two can have a discussion about what happened. However, if she\u2019s not willing to meet you half way in being reasonable and respectful then perhaps it\u2019s time the friendship ended, for you mental and emotional well-being.", "NTA. She should understand after some declined calls that you are busy. She should understand that when you say you are busy that you are busy. This may be able to be salvaged by a conversation explaining that she needs to respect if you\u2019re busy and have other people for help. If she doesn\u2019t, maybe good to have distance.\n\nFor your own sake, however, moving forward use do not disturb when you need absolute focus.", "If she only uses you to bail her out of emergencies of her own making is she really a friend you want to keep?  Especially when she can\u2019t respect that at times you\u2019ll have to tell her you\u2019re busy and can\u2019t drop everything that instant to talk to her?\nI think if you opt to not just drop her all together you need to have a chat that says you\u2019ve noticed she only reaches out when she has a problem and this most recent incident shows she doesn\u2019t understand that you have your own life and priorities that mean you can\u2019t always respond immediately. Her calling and texting relentlessly after you\u2019ve shown you\u2019re busy by sending her calls to VM and texting her you were busy and couldn\u2019t talk shows you that she either doesn\u2019t understand how adult friendships work or she doesn\u2019t respect you enough to realize that you aren\u2019t always able to be at her beck and call. Point out how disrespectful it was for her to continue to contact you after you said you were busy and that while you regret the word choice the exasperation behind it was real, earned, and not something you\u2019ll apologize for. \nBut really, drop the drama llama.", "Why is her life more important than yours? Does she reciprocate and help you when needed? Might want to rethink the friendship or at the very least set some ground rules.

I would have probably snapped at her like you did.\n\nAlso, has Lucy never heard of Uber. This was an emergency any competent adult could handle.", "Bra she\u2019s a user. Cut her off.", "NTA. Sounds exhausting and you seem done with it. Time to cut your losses, do you want 30 more years of this shit?", "NTA. If you decline calls like that AND texts to say you\u2019re not available any sane person would go to the next person on their emergency contact list.

Lucy had other options to handle her \u201cemergency\u201d so when you declined her call several times she should he respected that and realized you had something going on and couldn\u2019t be interrupted.

If you were able to help her that\u2019s one thing, but thinking that HER work is more important than your own and that her emergency means you need to drop everything at any second to help is way too much. \n\nShe\u2019s being cold because she wants you to feel bad so that you will continue waiting on her every whim.

But you're right, it does come across like she wanted fanfare at his expense.", "She is an energy sucking vampire. I know a girl who does this to one of my close friends and it has honestly ruined his life. He is so used to being her doormat that he basically stopped living his life the way he wanted to accommodate her chaos and to \"help her\". Everything is an emergency and she is the main character so his issues and priorities always take a back seat to hers no matter what. She cries wolf for pity, money, and attention 24/7. I'm clearly biased against narc assholes, but I think OP is def NTA and honestly might be better off finding real friends. Vampires aren't friends.", "Oh my god. My pet peeve with my stepmum. I'd be at work, phone in a locker. Check it on break and find four missed calls, three \"call me back when you get this\" voicemails, and a text asking to call her when I see this. All while she knows I'm at work. And she's watching my kid, so, y'know, panic. Decide to skip break, run outside to do the callback. \"Was it the brown or the black shampoo you liked? The brown one was on sale and was gonna get it for you. Oh, I'm home now, was just when I was in the store\", or \"what was the name of that film you recommended to me last week?\", or - my favourite - \"oh, I wanted to ask you something but I've forgotten, I'll call you when I remember\". And now I've to go back on the clock, having not had time to eat, pee, or relax.\n\nAnd then she got huffy when she had a fall and broke her wrist, and I didn't call her back until I finished for the day. The first actual important one after five years of 1-2 a week junk ones. Not that I could have done anything, being neither a doctor nor close to her. And she could have called the company's emergency contact line to have a manager come tell me, not sure why she didn't.

Enable not disturb until finished with the training.", "Me too! Hilarious", "Yup. Some people just don't understand what the purpose of a voicemail or text message is. I get the newest generation, they have had immediate access to people their whole lives. \n\nBut the older generation?? I cannot understand it. I remember my parents constantly letting phone calls go to the answering machine, so they could screen calls, and then ignore them if they didn't want to answer them. Or how they would leave their house all day long, and never check the answering machine messages until they got home. And now we have cell phones they think \"Oh goodie, now you're at MY disposal 24/7\"", "Totally agree.", "What, she can't just put nine sad emojis of crying instead to get the message across? :P", "Lol. Yes.\n\nI will say from what little info we have here, and what I experienced with shift work, an Uber may have been out of reach for Lucy. All the clues in the story makes me lean towards Lucy being very bad with money (I am also projecting some of my own issues and past experiences on her here)", "Then that makes it worse. OP's reaction is definitely justified. I hope he enjoys the cooldown without regularly having his time disrespected.", "I didn't mention an uber/taxi because I also assumed she was bad with money. also because I figured with the type of person she seems to be (acting like OP's life revolves around her and that he can drop whatever he's doing to help her at any given time without even a text explaining what's wrong) that an uber wouldn't have even crossed her mind. she's probably too used to taking advantage of people she knows and them always being around to help. if she *did* consider an uber or taxi she probably would have no idea how to contact them and panic for no reason", "NTA, OP.  And this is exactly what I thought too.  She wasn't mangled in a car accident, thank god.  She was just going to be slightly inconvenienced that day.  Sure, you could have done without swearing at her, but after 30 years of this behavior, I get it.  Plus she was genuinely bugging you while you *were* doing something important.  It sounds like a very one-sided friendship.  You've apologized for cursing at her, and she's ignoring it - there's not much more you can do.\n\nI'm in a current freeze-out with a friend who was like this in a way.  She's not  \"urgent urgent urgent\" all the time.  But she's just someone who - it was all about her.  She always needed the sympathy, it was all the \"tiny tears\" over everything.\n\nFinally, there was an incident a few weeks ago that she was 100% wrong about (*plus I found out she told a whopper of a lie to make herself look better*), and I refused to kiss her ass over her behavior.  So she's not talking to me, and that's okay.   I get that you were friends with her for 30 years, but sometimes it's okay to let those kinds of friendships fall by the wayside when they're just one-sided.  And even if it does get back on track, consider this quiet time as a breather from her.", ">NAOWWWWEEEWWWWW\n\nMy 3 year old was wailing \"OWWWWIIIIEEEEE\" over and over just a few minutes ago, so I heard this in her voice \ud83e\udd23", "It's a he?\n\nThat makes more sense now.", "Not to mention she kept calling OP instead of trying her dad or someone else earlier when it was clear he was busy. Maybe she wouldn't have been late for work.", "Also, what was OP supposed to do? Leave work to make sure SHE got to work?\n\nCalling once was fine (although I'm not sure OP could solve this problem for her without leaving HIS place of work), but when OP didn't pick up, she needed to call someone else or find another solution.", "This is basically what happened to to boy who cried wolf.", "Strong main character vibes. Agree.", "Exactly!", "NTA\n\nIn my family, a 911 text means you are currently dying, on fire, or going to jail.", "if it was real 911 she would have called herself", "The Michael Scott approach", "I don't know about iPhone but with galaxy phones you have to deliberately allow it to let calls through like that. So might depend on OPs phone type", "The 911 and incessant calls is because she\u2019s panicking and she needed OP to regulate her nervous system. I used to be like this. It wasn\u2019t about the crisis, it was about my mindset and needed someone to regulate me. That\u2019s why she lost it when he wouldn\u2019t pick up and asked her to wait 30 mins. Lucy is an adult and needs to learn to regulate her damn self. Not saying it\u2019s easy, but now she\u2019s discarding OP cuz he didn\u2019t help her with her BPD meltdown, and she probably feels betrayed and abandoned (so want to stress OP did NONE OF THOSE THINGS, that\u2019s just what her brain is telling her happened). It sounds like a lot of learned helplessness, severe anxiety and nervous system disregulation, and an over reliance on OP as her person that regulates her and pulls her out of her spirals. Again I wanna stress that this is not healthy for an adult, and not healthy for OP to continue doing.  It does make sense that OP fell into that roll after being friends since they were little kids tho.\n\nShe\u2019s discarding now because she feels hurt and abandoned. Lucy needs severe mental health help.", "Reminds me: when I lived in Australia, my boss texted me the morning after our Christmas party, \u201cwon\u2019t be in today. Car trouble.

Then burst out laughing. \n\u201cPissed and Broke.\u201d", "Because then op would realize that this was not, in fact, a real emergency.", "LOL. Next time this \"friend\" has an emergency, direct her to call 911. Maybe that will help her understand what emergency means.", "Yeah, def seems like a one sided friendship, probably not worth keeping.\n\nBut, in a related note, has OP never heard of 'do not disturb?' It's this cool feature on your phone that stops it from ringing, buzzing, or otherwise making itself a nuisance. It's usually easily accessible and can be assigned a time limit. I have mine set to dnd if I set it face down on a table.", "Omg! This is my father to a T. It is so infuriating. I work from home and live very close by to him so he also has no boundaries and will invasively walk in the house whenever he pleases.

Thank you kind internet stranger!", "When I and my siblings were kids, my mom's 'emergency' question was, \"Is there blood?\"  \n\n\nOne day, I came running up to her while she was on the phone, complaining loudly about how my one brother wouldn't leave me alone. Yet again, she asked, \"Is there blood?\" Without missing a beat, I tossed back, \"No, but there's gonna be!\" ... She hung up the phone.", "Honestly uber probably should have been called before OP. Lucy was running so late for work that she couldn't wait 20 minutes for OP to get back to her, and OP was already at work, so would have had to leave work, drive to OP's, and then drive her to work. Lucy probably would have been late anyways, and OP would have had to explain to her boss why she suddenly took off for an hour or so in the middle of the day.", "I had a friend who never used Uber and the one time he needed it and created an account there was some banking system issue so it wouldn\u2019t accept his payment card as valid. (This friend just has that kind of luck.) He even gave me his login and payment card details so I could try from a computer in case it was some weird mobile device/app issue. Nope. So I just ordered him one with my account.\n\nSo very very rarely things do get messed up. \ud83d\ude02 (But my friend first asked me if I had time to help and would have tried someone else if I hadn\u2019t.

But OP was in the middle of a work requirement, too, and would have ended or failed that timed assessment to drop everything to help.

When we got engaged I said, \u201cWe\u2019re about to become a family, so this needs to end. If your friend wants help painting his living room or a ride to the airport, sure.
