I use a shampoo/conditioner that works for me and is honestly one of the only products that leaves my hair feeling moisturized, as most shampoos/conditioners leave my hair feeling very dry. My roommate once told me that I should switch my shampoo/conditioner, saying that she used to use it herself in the past and it left her hair feeling oily (edit: she used her own bottles of it, she did not use/steal mine). I told her that it doesn\u2019t leave my hair feeling oily and it works for me, but she still told me I should think of changing it, which was odd to me. Another time she told me that I usually smell very strongly like my shampoo/conditioner (which by the way is Shea butter & coconut scented), and she just didn\u2019t like the smell of Shea butter. I myself am sensitive to strong perfume smells but this scent isn\u2019t so perfume-like/dense, so I can handle it even when it is strong, but I understand not everyone is the same.

This leads me to suspect that there might be a visible racial difference between the two of you, and she might be wary of broaching \"I can't stand the smell of your hair\" with you for fear of sounding racist.\n\nBut regardless of whether that's why she's having difficulty using her words, she'd still be much better served by being open and honest about what problem (if any) she has with your hair products. If she only really has a problem on days when you wash your hair and then hang around in the room, is there scope for her to go out on those mornings? If she went and studied in the library for an hour or two while your hair dried, would that eliminate the worst of the problem? Could you flip your morning routine around a bit on those days so you showered an hour later to give her chance to wash and dress and leave before the invasion of the hair products?\n\nI don't think you and your roommate will achieve complete compatibility here, but perhaps there's scope for the two of you to adjust your routines a bit to make things better.", "You could rinse it with warm water.

That smell is really unpleasant to me.", "Agreed, but the roommate shouldn't expect her to switch products just because it didn't work for her. She hasn't vocalized the real problem (assuming it is) that it makes her nauseous directly to OP.", "At the very least you should give her a heads up if you\u2019re heading in to wash your hair and she is out in the living room/kitchen/whatever since you say the scent is very noticeable when you come out. That way she can open some windows, hole up in her room for a bit, or leave altogether for a while if needed.\n\nYou aren\u2019t obligated to change your products for her, but since you aren\u2019t even willing to try to mitigate the issue, you should discuss it with her. She deserves to be able to not be nauseated, and since you say you yourself have experienced feeling sick and a headache from other products, I think it does kind of make YTA that you aren\u2019t willing to even explore any other solutions.", "My hair isn\u2019t oily, it\u2019s very dry! As I\u2019ve said it\u2019s pretty equally dry when I wash it regularly and when I space out my washes more. Not really looking for hair advice here is I am content with my routine and know my hair well", "I agree she should. I could be wrong, but I get the sense that OP and roommate are college-aged, and the girl probably felt bad telling someone your bath product is legitimately making me sick. Making up some random excuse is not the solution, but I can see how someone might think that was a less burdensome way of navigating the situation.\n\nNow that OP knows though, I think she should broach the topic. Or at least give the girl a heads up if she\u2019s heading in to wash her hair if the girl is in the living room or wherever, since OP says the scent is very noticeable when she comes out of the bathroom. That way the roommate can hole up in her room or vacate temporarily for a bit if needed.", "The market is honestly so limited for effective hair care products for my hair type. I would have no issue switching if I could find something easily that doesn\u2019t have a smell that bothers her, but it would be hard to find something that both works for me and doesn\u2019t make her feel sick. I actually don\u2019t know a shampoo/conditioner aside from the one I currently use that has worked for me and didn\u2019t make me feel sick, so it would take trial and error to find one and I don\u2019t even feel confident that it\u2019s really out there. But, she knows when I\u2019m about to wash my hair, we share a room and she can see when I\u2019m about to take a shower, and I shower every morning same time, so she has a heads up in that sense", "Yeah, we are college age", "So again, broach the topic that perhaps you guys should ask to do a room swap at your college. Since it will require getting whoever heads up (what I\u2019m assuming are dorms) involved and making it official. The situation is eventually going to be untenable for her more than likely.", "No, it\u2019s the end of the year, we have a few weeks left and we otherwise work fine as roommates, so no switch is going to take place", "If you are opposed to any potential solution, why did you even post here? Just for people to tell you it\u2019s fine to keep using the products in question? You already know you aren\u2019t obligated to stop. You doubling down on refusing any potential solution is making you a bigger and bigger AH in my eyes though. Have a good one.", "Oh, I guess I posted here more to ask about the situation than to ask for solutions. I didn\u2019t think this subreddit was really an advice column and I\u2019m not looking so much for solution-oriented advice as most of the solutions are obvious things and we\u2019re not living together much longer. If that offends you I don\u2019t know what to say to that. I was just trying to tell you that there\u2019s no need for a long-term solution as we\u2019re not going to be living together much longer"]}
