Whenever I have early shifts my daughter would stay at her dad's house so he could get her ready for school and drop off her there. We got into some dumb argument and I shouted at him and used expletives. I acknowledged I was wrong and apologized but he refused my apology, which is fine by me and understandable. This argument took place on one of my days off and I went to his home as I would normally do on my days off to help out child with homework.  This I did shortly after our argument as prior to the argument I was already getting ready to go over there. Because he was so upset, in the middle of homework, he comes to our six years old and shouted at her to leave with me and never come back there. We packed most of her things and left. She loves her dad and misses him and his sister who lives there would normally help out with her studies after school since she is a teacher. She wants to spend time with her father and I allow her to because they have a great bond and she would still see him since his sister still helps with the studies. However, what he said to her rubbed me the wrong way and I am pissed at him for ever saying that to her. She wants to sleep over his house at times but I told her that until he apologies for how he treated her that day she will not be allowed to sleep over. She is really upset about it and says she doesn't need his apology she just wants to spend more time as she did with daddy. I don't want her to think it is ok for a man or anyone to disrespect her and they remain chummy chummy with each other without an apology.

Some of you like people to suffer don\u2019t you?", "Info:  If you have him blocked, how do you expect he to apologize?   Based off that you're saying your child should never spend time with her father again.", "NTA- no matter what is going on between the two of you...any parent that yells at their kid to leave and never come back doesn't deserve to be a parent. You are protecting her. She is too young to get it now. But she will. This probably wasn't the first time he said something like that to the child and definitely won't be the last.", "You both suck. ESH. Except the poor kid. Neither of you sound mature at all and like you have major anger issues. Stop using your kid as a pawn. You want to teach her men shouldn't treat her like that? By teaching her that her opinions don't matter to you? You both need to get over yourselves.", "ESH.

When your toxic relationship with your ex spills over and affects your child, you\u2019re both wrong. Her father absolutely owes her an apology, but I think you\u2019re failing to see your part in creating an emotionally charged situation in the first place. You should coach her (without your feelings involved) to talk to her dad about how his words made her feel, and ask her dad to be receptive and kind when she does. Your daughter misses her dad.", "This was extremely hard to understand but I assume we are talking here about the father of the child and not your father.\n\nNTA he should not talk to his daughter like this especially if he is angry with you. Though that's my opinion I think you need to actually unblock him and talk to him properly and alone to see what has caused this outburst because if it's something that has background, you probably want to address that before she goes over again. He can't just take his bad mood out on her.", "NTA, my father would have never ever said that to me. My heart hurts for your daughter. I\u2019m such a daddy\u2019s girl, I\u2019m 36, but still a daddy\u2019s girl to the end.

OP has said he's refused to apologize, which makes sense - why would he apologize to the kid for what he said to the mother", "There is some truth to your statement and providing a stable home is something I am actively working on including being a better mother. Your input is appreciated ESH.", "Very concerning indeed", "He knows where I live he can come and talk. A week before I blocked him I offered to have a civil discussion about what transpired between him and our child but he  decided not to apologize.", "It is not the first time he has done something like this which is what has me upset.

Whether it is a healthy debate or argument, if he doesn't get his way the situation blows up.", "I am currently taking anger management classes. I actually had recently begun taking them prior to the argument. There are certain things he says and does that triggers me. He is narcissistic and I am doing my best to manage that better. I lost it that day because I asked him jn a respectable manner at first to stop doing something I did not like a few times. He ignored my requests and I got upset.", "That is my point. When he is upset with me my child NEVER  my end that something is wrong with us. NEVER. But she will know from his behavior and attitude.", "I'm a daddy's girl too (he died 5 years ago, doesn't change that one bit). My dad never purposely said anything to hurt me, and in fact went out of his way to tell me he always wanted a little girl. However, he was raised by parents who didn't know how to express emotions, so a handful of times was a bit careless with his words. They cut like a knife the few times this happened (in the 30 years I had my dad), even though I knew he loved me and would never intentionally hurt me. I couldn't have trusted my dad again if he told me he didn't want me anymore, especially at such a tender age. It's sad that the daughter has accepted this behavior so easily.", "Thank you for this perspective. I value your opinion and will take this into serious consideration. FYI he still is allowed to see her, it's just the sleep over part is a no. He has a history of ignoring her when he is upset and I guess I am just annoyed that whenever he is upset about something he treats her differently and then she complains to me about it.", "Yes I did. I apologized afterwards for my reaction. He refused and that's ok, he has a right to I just didn't like what he said to our child.", "I am sorry about my language and it's confusion. You have a point I shouldn't have gone there knowing he was upset. When I went there I ignored him, kept out of his way and was helping my child with her homework like I promised I would. Though his treatment of her when he is upset is not uncommon, I did not expect that outburst and asking her never to return.", "Did you miss the bit where he was abusive to the six year old?", "Yes he has anger issues. He lives in the same home with her aunt who helps her with her studies so it is unavoidable for them to see each them to not see each other", "I am pretty sure she meant the father of her child. Its clear from the rest of the post.", "Outside verbally abusing your daughter he is a good father???? \n\n\nYou have an interesting way of looking at things.", "So your 6 year old child asked her dad to his face if he meant he never wanted to see her again, and he admitted he was talking to her, but they hang out together after school everyday?  Yeah... this sounds realistic.", "You're making it more difficult for him to do what you are asking, and in the time that you have had him blocked he may well have tried. You're adding petrol to the fire so you can cling to the idea that he won't do the right thing, and you are in the right.\n\nYou are right that he and your daughter should know that that exchange was not okay. But as you used your daughter as an excuse to invade his space mid argument he had every right to be pissed at you. \n\nESH - if you want to make the situation right for your daughter unblock him and try to have a conversation.", "If he yelled at her and you to get out and never come back then why is she at his house again and him allowing it?", "> FYI he still is allowed to see her, it's just the sleep over part is a no.\n\nDoes he even know this? Even if he does, you have him blocked so how can he arrange to see her?", "So youre doing this to your daughter because you are annoyed? You can\u2019t be fkn serious - what do you think this is doing to your daughter? Your child isn\u2019t a pawn to use against your ex.", "Then my vote is NTA. If you took responsibility for your actions he should as well. What he said to your daughter was hurtful and unnecessary and he does need to apologize to her big time. Taking out his frustrations on his child is an AH move. Though I recommend unblocking him otherwise he won\u2019t able to touch base once he gets his a$$ out of his head.", "Think about the scenario.  Who do you think he was yelling at. The 6 year old who was supposed to be there. Or the ex who came into his house minutes after arguing with him pretending  it didn't just happen.", "abusive is a strong word.", "Yes he is a great father", "Yes I know. If I could I would have prevented her from seeing him all together until he apologized but her aunt is really good at helping her grasp her lessons. I am not one to refuse help that can benefit my child. My daughter, even though what was said to her was wrong, has forgiven her dad and doesn't mind seeing him. I don't want to block her from him entirely.

When he is ready to speak to me he can. Last night he was the one to drop her off and when she asked me in front of him of she could sleep over, I looked him in the eyes and told him all he needs to do is apologize to you for what he said. She asked him to apologize and he said no.", "I understand she is not a pawn. But this is not the first time he has disrespected her and failed to apologize. She is a very forgiving child and I don't want her to think that emotional abuse or any form of abuse is ok.", "If you read OPs comments he very clearly stated that he was yelling at the 6yr old and has refused to apologize to the 6 yr old. In my mind that makes him a huge AH and I don't begrudge OP for not wanting her daughter to be over there.", "I would call screaming at a 6 year old and telling her to get out and never come back abusive.", "So it's fine if he verbally abuse her - so that's where you draw your line? So its not okay to physically abuse, but mentally/emotionally/verbally - yeah sure no problem ???? \n\n\n\nWell congratulations on helping a future psychiatrist pay off their mortgage I guess.", "No, the moment a parent screams any sort of abuse to a child, they are no longer a good parent. This is extremely toxic and it's heartbreaking that you don't understand that.", "No he isn\u2019t. Its emotional abuse to a six year old girl. \u201cLook what mummy made me do, it\u2019s mummy\u2019s fault im angry at you\u201d is what he basically said, and now he\u2019s a great dad? Is he fuck.", "> I looked him in the eyes and told him all he needs to do is apologize to you for what he said. She asked him to apologize and he said no.\n\nThat's so horrible. I'll never understand why people think it's okay to hurt others and then refuse to apologize. \n\nMight want to reconsider blocking him though, because if he was with your daughter and he needed to call due to an emergency situation, you wouldn't receive the call.", "You're missing the part where YOUR actions are devaluing her here. You can't see that you're disrespectful to her while simultaneously telling her no one else should be?\n\nShe is not you. She does not want the apology. This is clearly more about your feelings than hers OP.", "good for you", "Yay you could be right Jinx about it being more about my feelings than her. I just don't want her to live in a cycle if verbal abuse thinking it's ok."]}
