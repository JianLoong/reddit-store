While I appreciate the gesture, unfortunately it isn\u2019t feasible for me to go.\u201d", "NTA, but I still think some talking with your parents needs to be done to find out the reason they booked this trip.  Sure, a BIG reason might be the fact your younger sister hasn't gone before, and that might have been a big factor for doing so.  But, along with that, perhaps they simply looked as this being an opportunity for the family to travel together one last time, especially if there is a new life (with a future husband) down the road.\n\nAre your parents aware of your problem with sensory overload?  If this is a newly diagnosed issue for you, are they aware of how it effects you?  Don't just throw them under the bus yet for this, as they may have (innocently) completely missed the mark.  Yeah, they should have talked to you before, but perhaps things can still get ironed out.\n\nThis still might be something you could do, as I don't think you need to overwhelm yourself in the park.  Perhaps some time alone, chilling at the pool, or finding some other quiet spot might be something you can enjoy.

Tell your parents right away that you aren't going.  Tell them you hope they have a great time with your sister.  Thank them for the offer.  Be gracious (even if they weren't). \n \n\nPerhaps your sister has a friend that might appreciate the trip?  Make that suggestion.  Thank them for the offer though.  Don't appear ungrateful.  Just say you don't want to go and suggest they use the extra ticket for one of your sister's friends.

You\u2019re an AH if it goes any other way", "NTA. They should listen to you and respect how you feel. And just my opinion but I think if you want to be treated differently you need to say no and refuse to go and be clear that it's wrong for them to plan an event \"for your birthday\" to a place where you would be uncomfortable and you were very clear you did not want to go there which they completely ignored.  It seems like they wanted to do this for the younger sister and are pretending it's for your birthday to guilt you into it.", "NTA. Don't go. They didn't even ask you what you wanted to do for your birthday. They're doing this for your sister, not you. You are old enough to decide what you want to do for your birthday. So they can bring one of your sister's friends or a relative with them. They'll get mad; they'll guilt you. But they can't ground you or take away your electronics.

So I guess I\u2019m saying don\u2019t discredit your reason for not wanting to go, it\u2019s just as valid as any other reason. And they also clearly are making it about your sister getting to go. \n\nBut\u2026 they can still go.

And you\u2019re right, going would just show them that you\u2019ll cave in the future. However, if you\u2019d be into going were it not for the sensory stuff, maybe look into what accommodations Disney offers for that. But don\u2019t go just because your parents want you to want it.", "NTA. That sounds more like a trip for your sister than for you.  Maybe tell them in enough time to bring someone else or get a refund on your ticket.  Sadly,  I don't think that they'll give you a  different gift.", "NTA: If they wanted to do something for you they should have thought about what you would have enjoyed. Not only are they picking a vacation for their younger daughter, they're picking a vacation you absolutely will not enjoy.\n\nDo not feel bad if you don't go.

Sounds more like your parents planned a trip for your sister for your birthday. So fubar.\n\nYou were clear about not wanting to go and have very valid reasons for not wanting to go.\n\nHaving been to Disney as a teenager, it is a very stimulating trip.

You told them straight up you did not want this and they spent the money anyway. If they\u2019re mad they did it to themselves.\n\nPlan something with your fianc\u00e9 that makes you guys happy \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. This isn't a trip for you, they are just using you as the excuse, and so they can get mad at you if you don't go on this family vacation since it's \"for you\".\n\nIf you do decide to go, there are a bunch of things you can do to mitigate. I'm also nerodivergent to a degree and have anxiety in large crowds, but my family went in December and I had a blast. \n\nIf standing in line in a crowded space is an issue, look into getting a DAS (disability services) pass. It will let you pre-book rides so you don't have to stand in a loud crowd for an hour just to ride something. For show like the fireworks, stand in the back of the crowd, or get to the theater for theater shows early so you can get seats in the back or near the exit - you will still get a great show without being stuck in the middle of the massive herd. Earplugs or noise canceling headphones are also really nice if you can use them. Also, plan meals at off-peak meal times so you avoid the crowds there. You can also make good use of mobile ordering and send someone in to pick it up for the more crowded restaurants (I loved the corn dogs from Casey's Corner, but had to send my brother in to get them because it was way too crowded in there).\n\nDepending on when you are going, it might also make sense to get to the parks a little after they open so you don't need to deal with security. And if you can afford it, getting the Genie+ (their skip-the-line service) for Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios will help a great deal.\n\nAll that being said, you should only go if you want to. You have no obligation to go just because they decided to use you as an excuse to go to Disney. I'd book a nice relaxing spa weekend or something somewhere with your fiance and turn off your phone or block your family while they are gone so you don't get guilt-trippy phone calls about how you should have gone.", "NTA tell them no firmly now. Don\u2019t let them guilt trip you", "NTA. If they had asked you, you'd have said no. The fact that they didn't, and are now going to be out a chunk of money because you're not going, is not your fault. Hitting them in the wallet is going to be a very fast way to ensure they respect your boundaries in the future.", "NTA since you had already told more than once that you weren't interested.  But if you decide to go then maybe instead of going to the park with them you can hang out by the pool and chill instead having to deal with the crowds.", "NTA. It sounds like it\u2019s time to disengage. \u201cI hope you and sister have fun on the trip! As I said before, I don\u2019t enjoy being at Disney, so fianc\u00e9 and I will be doing something else.\u201d", "NTA. Keep in mind that whenever someone gives you a \"gift\" that really only benefits them, they are giving a gift to themselves, not you. \n\nYou don't have to be grateful for somebody giving a gift to themself. \n\nHowever, as someone who is neurodivergent and loves amusement parks, I will say that if you think you could enjoy this trip at all minus the sensory issues, there may be a workaround for you. For instance, you could take sunglasses and ear plugs with you (ear plugs help me *so much* when I go on rides, I couldn't imagine doing it without them). \n\nAlso check beforehand what kind of snacks are sold at the park and which of them would be edible to you if you should be having a bad day. Look up where to buy those safe snacks and how to get there. Being hungry can add a lot to an already raised stress level, so you'll want to be super sure that you eat enough while you're there.\n\nETA: Oh, I forgot to include this part. If you still don't want to go, regardless, then stand your ground. Yes, there will be drama, but in the end it might help reinforce that boundary for you. Your parents and sister can still go, they'll just be out some extra money. They should get over it after some time.", "NTA\n\nYour parents stole your birthday gift and gave it to your sister. Don't legitimize it by accepting and pretending everything is ok.", "NTA.

What were they thinking.", "NTA.  They want this for your little sister, not for you. It's manipulative to use your birthday as cover. Don't go if you don't want to. They can let your sister bring a friend in your place.", "Perhaps you should tell them how excited you are for the trip your family will take to your own preferred destination for your sister's birthday, since this seems to be how your family celebrates birthdays.", "NTA. Tell them that your early birthday gift to your younger sister will be that she can bring along friend instead of you.", "Sounds like your parents want some family time with just the four of you. If your boyfriend was there it would be a different trip. As you are getting older and may be getting more serious with your boyfriend, your parents are probably aware that you will soon be establishing your own life and creating your own family. It may be difficult for you to see things this way, being younger and in love, but how much time does your family spend with you without your boyfriend around? They probably miss spending one-on-one time with you.", "NTA\n\nYou already told them you do not want to go to Disney. You're 22.

You want to be with your fiancee on your birthday--there is literally nothing wrong with that.\n\nSecondly, them paying for the trip/flight does **not** entitle them to your compliance.\n\nYou said you didn't want to go on this trip, and they ignored you. That makes them TA for sure.  Also, if they're truly upset about the \"wasted\" expense of having booked the flight/tickets only to have you not go -- well, that'll sure make it easy for them to remember to not pull this BS on you the next time.", "NTA. But don\u2019t miss a nice trip just because you\u2019re worried about sensory issues. If you can handle a grocery store, I think you\u2019ll be fine at Disney World (and there are many quiet places where you can sit and recharge if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed). Why not tell your parents you\u2019d like your fianc\u00e9 to come for both fun and emotional support ? If they say no, then you can decide whether you want to go or not. Good luck and happy early birthday !", "NTA. If you don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t. Would they be willing to allow your sister to take a friend or two with her in your place? I totally understand not wanting to go to Disney- any amusement park or event such as this is not fun (for me personally). \n\nEnjoy something you want to do on your birthday. Declining a trip you\u2019ve already stated you don\u2019t want to partake in is not entitled, bratty behavior. It\u2019s honesty.\n\nEdit to add: your boundaries should be respected, as you are 22 years old. Your relationship is strained because you aren\u2019t allowing them to control you.", "Exactly what I would say. It\u2019s financial and emotional manipulation to get what they want and it\u2019s really up to you if you want to point that out or not. I think you know what you want but you just don\u2019t wanna feel bad about wanting it. Also parents are notoriously bad for this kinda thing because they did govern your life for so long  it can be a adjustment for them to realize they don\u2019t have that Agency anymore. But they will never realize how to properly communicate with you if you don\u2019t reinforce your statement that your not wanting to go. And if there upset then maybe say how your also upset because your not being heard and having boundaries that where set in the past blatantly disregarded. They never where asking you to go they where basically saying there probably planing it so get ready and we\u2019ll now they fucked up thinking that guilting you and making it seem like it\u2019s for you would force your hand. This was never for you, it\u2019s just a easy excuse to make you feel more like you need to go or you will be the boiled kid that doesn\u2019t like there amazing gift. And that\u2019s just not the case. \n\nIt be different if they planed a different trip. Sure there would still be some holes in communication that need to be addressed and a respect that needs to be given to a grown woman. But at least it wouldn\u2019t be a blatant disregard of something you specifically said you didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude4f", "OP is still not TA even if the parents can't get a refund, as OP told them months ago she didn't want to go and they ignored it.", "OP's parents could try to find a cousin/friend of her sister to go with them instead.
