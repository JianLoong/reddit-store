Sure, a BIG reason might be the fact your younger sister hasn't gone before, and that might have been a big factor for doing so.  But, along with that, perhaps they simply looked as this being an opportunity for the family to travel together one last time, especially if there is a new life (with a future husband) down the road.\n\nAre your parents aware of your problem with sensory overload?  If this is a newly diagnosed issue for you, are they aware of how it effects you?  Don't just throw them under the bus yet for this, as they may have (innocently) completely missed the mark.  Yeah, they should have talked to you before, but perhaps things can still get ironed out.\n\nThis still might be something you could do, as I don't think you need to overwhelm yourself in the park.  Perhaps some time alone, chilling at the pool, or finding some other quiet spot might be something you can enjoy.

Be gracious (even if they weren't). \n \n\nPerhaps your sister has a friend that might appreciate the trip?  Make that suggestion.  Thank them for the offer though.  Don't appear ungrateful.

If they\u2019re mad they did it to themselves.\n\nPlan something with your fianc\u00e9 that makes you guys happy \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. This isn't a trip for you, they are just using you as the excuse, and so they can get mad at you if you don't go on this family vacation since it's \"for you\".\n\nIf you do decide to go, there are a bunch of things you can do to mitigate. I'm also nerodivergent to a degree and have anxiety in large crowds, but my family went in December and I had a blast. \n\nIf standing in line in a crowded space is an issue, look into getting a DAS (disability services) pass. It will let you pre-book rides so you don't have to stand in a loud crowd for an hour just to ride something. For show like the fireworks, stand in the back of the crowd, or get to the theater for theater shows early so you can get seats in the back or near the exit - you will still get a great show without being stuck in the middle of the massive herd. Earplugs or noise canceling headphones are also really nice if you can use them. Also, plan meals at off-peak meal times so you avoid the crowds there. You can also make good use of mobile ordering and send someone in to pick it up for the more crowded restaurants (I loved the corn dogs from Casey's Corner, but had to send my brother in to get them because it was way too crowded in there).\n\nDepending on when you are going, it might also make sense to get to the parks a little after they open so you don't need to deal with security. And if you can afford it, getting the Genie+ (their skip-the-line service) for Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios will help a great deal.\n\nAll that being said, you should only go if you want to. You have no obligation to go just because they decided to use you as an excuse to go to Disney. I'd book a nice relaxing spa weekend or something somewhere with your fiance and turn off your phone or block your family while they are gone so you don't get guilt-trippy phone calls about how you should have gone.", "NTA tell them no firmly now. Don\u2019t let them guilt trip you", "NTA. If they had asked you, you'd have said no. The fact that they didn't, and are now going to be out a chunk of money because you're not going, is not your fault. Hitting them in the wallet is going to be a very fast way to ensure they respect your boundaries in the future.", "NTA since you had already told more than once that you weren't interested.  But if you decide to go then maybe instead of going to the park with them you can hang out by the pool and chill instead having to deal with the crowds.", "NTA. It sounds like it\u2019s time to disengage. \u201cI hope you and sister have fun on the trip! As I said before, I don\u2019t enjoy being at Disney, so fianc\u00e9 and I will be doing something else.\u201d", "NTA. Keep in mind that whenever someone gives you a \"gift\" that really only benefits them, they are giving a gift to themselves, not you. \n\nYou don't have to be grateful for somebody giving a gift to themself. \n\nHowever, as someone who is neurodivergent and loves amusement parks, I will say that if you think you could enjoy this trip at all minus the sensory issues, there may be a workaround for you. For instance, you could take sunglasses and ear plugs with you (ear plugs help me *so much* when I go on rides, I couldn't imagine doing it without them). \n\nAlso check beforehand what kind of snacks are sold at the park and which of them would be edible to you if you should be having a bad day. Look up where to buy those safe snacks and how to get there. Being hungry can add a lot to an already raised stress level, so you'll want to be super sure that you eat enough while you're there.\n\nETA: Oh, I forgot to include this part. If you still don't want to go, regardless, then stand your ground. Yes, there will be drama, but in the end it might help reinforce that boundary for you. Your parents and sister can still go, they'll just be out some extra money. They should get over it after some time.", "NTA\n\nYour parents stole your birthday gift and gave it to your sister.

But don\u2019t miss a nice trip just because you\u2019re worried about sensory issues.

Declining a trip you\u2019ve already stated you don\u2019t want to partake in is not entitled, bratty behavior. It\u2019s honesty.\n\nEdit to add: your boundaries should be respected, as you are 22 years old.

It\u2019s financial and emotional manipulation to get what they want and it\u2019s really up to you if you want to point that out or not. I think you know what you want but you just don\u2019t wanna feel bad about wanting it. Also parents are notoriously bad for this kinda thing because they did govern your life for so long  it can be a adjustment for them to realize they don\u2019t have that Agency anymore. But they will never realize how to properly communicate with you if you don\u2019t reinforce your statement that your not wanting to go. And if there upset then maybe say how your also upset because your not being heard and having boundaries that where set in the past blatantly disregarded. They never where asking you to go they where basically saying there probably planing it so get ready and we\u2019ll now they fucked up thinking that guilting you and making it seem like it\u2019s for you would force your hand.

Sure there would still be some holes in communication that need to be addressed and a respect that needs to be given to a grown woman.

I suggest that if you go get a nice set of noise cancelling headphones or earbuds and walk around the entire time with them on. Maybe get several pair because your parents will probably rip them out and throw them away. Have a few meltdowns because of the noise if that's what it takes. It sounds like they want you to babysit your sister while they go do something else.

This was before I was diagnosed, and I hated it. It was overwhelming, and standing in lines was torture.\n\nWith the pass, you sign up for a ride, and they tell you what time to come back.
