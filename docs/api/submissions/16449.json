Your sister is likely to tell your father and step-mother that you know, so be prepared for pressure from them as well... and absolutely don't tell them. On a side note, don't pressure him to tell people. If he doesn't want to then he doesn't want to. You can certainly express concerns about the information if you think your father and step-mother need to know for some reason, but otherwise you should just be supportive of his decision not to tell them. Pressuring him, especially if it's just to get your sister off your case, would likely result in another AITA post.", "NTA \n\n>She is now pressuring me to tell her\n\nShe needs to get a life of her own.", "It's not your place to divulge the specifics.
