Just because someone died doesn't mean their request is somehow more special, and using a deathbed wish to try to get people to do what you want them to do, when it doesn't even have anything to do with them, is not a great thing to do. And just because someone made such a request does not mean you're bound to oblige them, even if you said yes at the time.

If you do this, she's off the hook of the promise to your sister. She wouldn't want to name a daughter after your mother either.

Too much emotional baggage that you will have to deal with for the rest of your life.\n\nYour dying sister should not have asked you to do so. It is such an odd request; it indicates that she knew that you would not want to do so unless she 'forced' you to do so. That means she knew that your mother was abusing you, but still thinks you need to honor your mother. All in all, your sister did not have good judgment. It is ok to love her, but there is no need to honor her poor judgment in this regard.\n\nNTA", "Anna's not pregnant and this isn't her child. She doesn't get a say.

Don't saddle her with a traumatic past, why would you do that?
