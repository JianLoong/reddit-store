He asked me of he could go and I asked him of he had put on deodorant in front of his friends. He gave me an angry yes and I told him I didn't believe him.

He told me not to ever call him sweetheart in front of the older kids or smell him.

Why would you feel that it was a good idea to embarrass him in front of his friends, particularly those who are a bit older? Do you enjoy being embarrassed in front of your friends or family? Perhaps you thought it was somewhat funny and wanted to be seen that way in front of the other kids. I hope not, since that would be very immature and kind of a bully move.\n\nYou could have just continued to remind him in private that as he is growing up, he is developing BO. Apparently you don't remember being that age and through early middle school where boys have BO, don't brush their teeth before school and don't take baths without lots of encouragement. \n\nYour son is heading into preadolescence and the way to maintain a loving relationship with him throughout adolescence (one that includes open communication and empathy) is to be respectful of your son as a human being with feelings, not disrespect him in that way.", "Sometimes shame can be a powerful tool, the kid needs to work on his hygiene and gentle nudges clearly are not doing it. He'll be fine, every teenager has been embarrassed by their parents at some point. NAH", "YTA\n\nAsking him quietly in private is one thing. Intentionally embarrassing him by asking loudly and giving him a sniff test in front of friends - older friends, at that - is always AH behaviour.", "YTA\n\nAnd some day if he embarrasses you I guess you\u2019ll have to be super gracious about it why would you deliberately make him publicly uncomfortable? It\u2019s a real asshole move", "He \"didn't take it out on you\", you embarrased him. YTA. You could have talked to him about using deodorant any other time yet you chose to make it an issue in front of his friends. You're the one who acted childish smelling him in front of his friends. Serious AH move.", "YTA. You embarrassed him in front of his older friends, and he probably wanted to appear cool in front of them. There's a difference between talking to him in private and quietly asking him if he had than what you did, which was loudly ask him in front of his older friends and do the sniff test.", "YTA, you could\u2019ve have pulled him aside and asked him privately? Kids can be brutal and to add salt to the wound you wanna continue embarrassing him with the sweetheart comment??? Come on lady you know what you were doing there. Time to grow up, he\u2019s still learning.", "YTA there was no reason to do that shit in front of his friends", "YTA- in front of friends- nope you embarrassed him in front of his friends .

Instead you embarrassed him in front of his friends.", "YTA, my parents used this tactic with us and I now am extremely sensitive about my breathe stinking and my body odor. Reminding your kid without the shaming is what you should\u2019ve done.", "NTA because it would be worse if you didn't make him put it on and rthe kids started teasing him for being smelly. I'm not for embarrassing anyone, but I really believe it would be worse if he didn't put on any deordant and got label the funky smelling kid at school. It's hard to live down those labels in school once they get put on you.", "YTA. Your son is getting close to the age where he's going to be hitting puberty and having a lot of tough, awkward moments physically and emotionally. He's already going to be feeling uncomfortable and embarrassed about his body. Using public humiliation to enforce personal hygiene isn't going to do anything to help him. What it is going to do is make him uncomfortable talking to you about anything and afraid to have you around his friends because you're going to put him down and get him bullied.", "YTA. Never shame your kid in front of his friends. That sets a really shitty precedent that teaches him it's okay to shame other people if they do something he doesn't like.", "YTA\n\nThere was no reason to say that directly in front of the friends. If you thought it was absolutely imperative to ask, say excuse me, close the door, pull him to the other room, etc. But you're an adult, you should know how to behave like a decent person, so I can only conclude you did this to intentionally embarrass him.", "I\u2019m voting NTA.\n\nThe kid stinks without his deodorant. A parent telling him about it will be a lot easier on him than other kids will.

He will fuss and argue but he needs deodorant . Explain when he uses deodorant daily on his own ( my certified genius son looked at me and said how will you know \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)  then he can stop applying deodorant in front of you. It\u2019s like showering, washing hair, brushing teeth, and wearing clean clothes all required to be a functional member of society.  So make sure he uses it before day begins so he\u2019s not embarrassed . The rest of us will thank you.", "YTA.

That\u2019s how my parents got me to remember deodorant. Because I wasn\u2019t a goat! I was a human girl! And I wanted to smell like a human girl!\n\nI have no resentment towards my padres for the cabra comparison because they never called me out in front of friends.

Congratulations on giving kids ammunition to bully your kid. Kids are ruthless. He\u2019s probably going to have some shitty nickname now. Be a better parent.", "Yes YTA. Smelling him in front of his friends isn't cool. For some reason when I was that age I was a bit anti-deodorant/soap as well, he's just going through a period of change and needs to adjust, he'll grow out of it soon enough.", "YTA - This is one of the worst ways to teach a child a lesson. \n\nGood luck as he gets older and you want to know what's going on in his life. He's not going to trust you enough to be honest with you.", "Yes YTA, I don't mention body stuff to my pre-teens even in front of their siblings...or their father for that matter. They embarass sooooo easily, and it's a huge deal for them. Be discrete in future.", "Yes, it's in your title, YTA.", "YTA. I have some memories of similar situations that happened with my mom.

You called him out, accused him of lying, and sniff checked him IN FRONT OF OLDER KIDS THAT WILL HUMILIATE HIM.

You were cruel and owe him an apology.", "YTA you need to axe this parenting style right now.", "You actually stuck your nose in his shirt in front of older kids and are asking if YTA? Well, you are.
