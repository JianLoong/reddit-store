Don\u2019t let her guilt trip you into feeling bad , when all she did was ground you from everyone and everything because she couldn\u2019t see what you were doin, who you were talking to either. You\u2019re also allowed to talk to the opposite sex if you want to especially if it\u2019s about homework. She is super controlling and obsessed over controlling you and your life.", "NTA, what your mom is doing now is called emotional blackmail and it\u2019s not surprising given how controlling she was before.", "when you question yourself remember your mental health and see how you did good and stood up for yourself.

This situation is due to her issues and actions.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like she has some serious control issues that were causing you mental harm. The way she treated you was not normal or healthy. You did what you had to do for your own mental health. Also, it's fairly hard for a father to get full custody in most states, so it's clear the court agreed that it was in your best interest.", "NTA. Ignore her tears. Let her think about how her controlling behaviour pushed you away. She needs to recognise what she did, apologise and work to build a better relationship with you.", "NTA\n\nAt the risk of being harsh, your mother is only in tears because she lost control of the situation. A parent who perpetually grounds their kids for the most minor of offences from making crude jokes to their friends or **talking to girls** is not a parent who is looking to educate or guide their child, they're looking to restrict them. Disciplining your child should be about establishing guidance between right and wrong, but \"bad language\" is just something you're going to learn, and girls are just people you'll end up speaking with. Penalizing these things doesn't make you a healthier, happier, or more vibrant individual, and it certainly doesn't encourage the sort of independent thinking and situational analysis you want kids to learn as they grow into adults. Basically, I'm saying your mother was punishing you to control you and little else.\n\nI'll also add that if your mother was open to change she would have listened, she would have self-analyzed, she would have noted how depressed you were getting. She brushed off your problems as \"teen drama\" and was too intent upon her methods to see that she was hurting you. A parent who does not adapt their parenting techniques to the changing needs of their child is a poor parent, but a parent who wholly disregards their childs needs is a bad parent overall.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, her crying on the phone doesn't make you a guilty party. It makes her distraught over the consequences of her own actions, and nothing else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
