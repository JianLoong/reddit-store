A parent who perpetually grounds their kids for the most minor of offences from making crude jokes to their friends or **talking to girls** is not a parent who is looking to educate or guide their child, they're looking to restrict them. Disciplining your child should be about establishing guidance between right and wrong, but \"bad language\" is just something you're going to learn, and girls are just people you'll end up speaking with. Penalizing these things doesn't make you a healthier, happier, or more vibrant individual, and it certainly doesn't encourage the sort of independent thinking and situational analysis you want kids to learn as they grow into adults. Basically, I'm saying your mother was punishing you to control you and little else.\n\nI'll also add that if your mother was open to change she would have listened, she would have self-analyzed, she would have noted how depressed you were getting. She brushed off your problems as \"teen drama\" and was too intent upon her methods to see that she was hurting you. A parent who does not adapt their parenting techniques to the changing needs of their child is a poor parent, but a parent who wholly disregards their childs needs is a bad parent overall.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, her crying on the phone doesn't make you a guilty party.

I hear these will record the calls, so that misbehaviors by an abusive parent can be tracked and the recordings used to protect you.  Your dad might want to do this.  \n\nAt your age, it's also okay to send a text message to your mom that you aren't her therapist, and won't be answering her messages where she's crying or yelling  \\[if she does\\], etc.  **Tell her that if she wants you to answer messages, she will need to be polite in her messages.**  \n\nEven then, **you do not have to answer everything she sends.**  ***You can set the limits here, and set boundaries that will protect yourself*** from her doing further harm to you with her emotional abuse.    If that means you only talk to her once a month, or twice a year, because she won't behave, that's **not your fault, it's her behavior.**  \n\nIf you end up needing to go No Contact with her, because she won't stop trying to manipulate you, that's also on her, not on you.  That you need to protect yourself against your mother's behaviors, and all the consequences of this, is all her fault, not yours.\n\n *which is making me wonder if I went to far, so AITA?*\n\nNTA.  **Protecting yourself was only necessary because your mother wasn't being a good parent to you.**  She was isolating you, invading your privacy at an age where privacy is very important, and treating in emotionally abusive ways.  You did what you had to do, to protect yourself from her behaviors.  She ought to get therapy to see what she's doing wrong, and how to change herself, but that's her job, not yours to handle.  \n\n**Emotionally abusive parents will try to make you feel responsible for their responsibilities, including their feelings.  That's what the crying calls are about**, trying to make you feel bad and guilty, and like you are responsible to make her feel better.  But good parents do not make their feelings their children's responsibility.  They don't have to hide their feelings, but they don't burden their children with fixing things for the parent.  That's making you take on the job of parenting for them; it's abusive.\n\n**The priority for you, and your dad, is your protection from your mother's wrong behaviors, from her abuses.**  If you want to read more about this, look for books on Emotional Abuse, to start with.  r/raisedbynarcissists used to have a good booklist on their wiki, and links in their sidebar.", "Ya did good, kid.", "Nope.

You first need to take care of yourself and there is time in the future for you to address your relationship with her on safer terms. Enjoy this time and focus on learning and friendships and creating memories!

At your age, social connections and increased independence/responsibility are important. Your description of time at Mom's sounds very punishing, restrictive and controlling. Her time with you is her opportunity to trap you in her home, depriving you of your usual resources and activities, without other social supports.

Your mother's emotional enmeshment with who/when/how you're communicating  pushed you into wanting and claiming more space for yourself. \n\nYour mother is emotionally dependent on you. This is not healthy, and your instinct to live with your father was natural  self-defense. \n\nYour mom needs psychological help to recognize her enmeshment and control issues, and also to process the grief she's experiencing from your rejection of her parenting. \n\nI'm sorry you had to go through this. My son and I went through something similar with his father. The court process was miserable because they insisted on sending us to family therapy, which only prolonged my ex's manipulation. In the end we succeeded in getting the court to change the possession schedule, but the damage my ex did to his relationship with our son is quite possibly irreparable.\n\nEnmeshed parents think boundaries apply to everyone else except them. They feel entitled to their children's attention and obedience. Functional, mentally well people don't act like your mother acts. If you haven't yet seen a counselor to discuss what you went through living with your mom, please think about it. You'll need some strategies and scripts for dealing with your mom as time goes by.

Split parents, abusive mother, went through my phone (in secret), searched room, restricted my ability to spend time with friends outside of school for no good reason. You name it, she did it. I gave her a lot more chances than you did. I only spent every second weekend and once a week after school with Dad. She kept pushing and I basically said \"you crossed a line, I'm living with Dad now, I'll come for the weekends my sisters spend with you. Cross it again and you wont have a son anymore.\" About a year later, whaddya know, she crosses it, big. Grabbed what I could fit in a bag and called Dad to pick me up. Left most of my possessions (including all my warhammer) and went completely no contact. With that context of the advice I'm about to give you, I hope you take it seriously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you even speak to her again, it will likely be incredibly stressful and emotionally taxing. If you choose to, do it in a safe public space and I suggest having a trusted friend with you as a support person. Take all the time you need, and I highly suggest just blocking her number. Explain what you're doing to your father so he knows not to be a messenger for her (look at what various subs like r/raisedbynarcissists and whatnot suggest about \"flying monkeys\"). Also, and this is very important, and a mistake I made that I really hope you don't. Get therapy. Your school will likely have some sort of counsellor you can see for free, book in to speak with them ASAP. If your Dad can afford it, see a psychologist outside of school. There is absolutely zero shame in seeking professional help, it is not a sign of weakness, and getting it sooner rather than later is best. You absolutely don't want to let your emotions fester and grow. I don't know exactly how bad it got for you with her, but I didn't do the work on mental health and when I was in my early 20's developed nightmares and panic attacks because of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake care of yourself kid.

She forced me to pick friends of her choosing then dump them. It was pretty awful.  \n\nFortunately for me and unfortunately for her, I am stubborn and once I made up my mind to deal with her, I put a lid on it all, but it was really hard and something I could do only when I was an adult and had my own income and let her know I could walk out at any time.
