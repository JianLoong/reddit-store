Removing your children from their harmful and disrespectful behaviour is not blackmail.\n\nYour children should not be left unsupervised with your parents period.

Stop entreating these people and keep away from them until they come to you with their tails between their legs on this.

You are their best teacher, and they need to learn from you and your husband how to stand up for themselves and know that their needs/wants/opinions matter. As far as limiting visitation with your folks, you're completely in the right.

He is your partner, your co parent.  These are HIS children in HIS home.  Allowing your parents to continue with their BS is just so rude to your spouse.  \n\nGrow a spine and be a strong parent and partner.", "NTA and IMO letting them get off easy. I recommend finding outside childcare & only having supervised visits with your children.  because if they disrespect you as parents to your face, they\u2019re gonna do it behind your back and they\u2019re going to raise your child the way that they want to.

I say ok and do what I think is right and my parents are shocked when we don\u2019t follow their instructions. It was the tone and smugness that got to me most , you can\u2019t tell us no we are your parents. Yes I can because you know adult with free will. Your children, your rules and grandparents can be willing members of the family or be restricted because of their own opinions and behaviors.", "NTA, but I do think there's one aspect missing from your post. They don't show any respect to you, but do they show any respect to your children? I'd be just as worried about that, and not want to leave them unsupervised unless I was sure your children are being treated better than you are.", "NTA.\n\nyour father sounds like he\u2019s going senile, because you seem caught off guard. That leads me to believe this isn\u2019t how he was when you grew up?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to make excuses, because keeping kids with a senile person is dangerous in its own right. I also don\u2019t know how old your parents are or anything. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed a lot of people hit \u201cthat age\u201d where they just start acting out against everyone to try and force a conflict. \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad for standing up for yourself. I wouldn\u2019t let them see my kids either.", "NTA. Your boundaries are entirely reasonable. Your parents sound selfish and they like this about other things?

Had he kept his mouth shut, he probably could continue to push the rules because it doesn't sound like immediate harm done (no giving peanuts to an allergic kid, etc).\n\n Once it's a taunt, that's different.

The lax rules will be framed as being correct with you guys being incorrect.", "mild YTA. grandparents are for spoiling kids. that is their role and goal in life, to send them back to you hyped up on sugar and love. Personally i think your no chocolate rule is actually depriving your youngest. but hey I am not the parent here. you need to relax a little. its ok for your grandparents to treat their grandkids, and if you didnt keep telling them your rules , then they wouldn't do their best to break them. learn to balance good upbringing with fun. And make sure you tell your children why they cant have this or that. at any age explaining your reasons to them helps them understand. they may not like or agree with it, but at least they will know your not making up rules just to make them feel bad. give a little, love a lot. and above all don't alienate your only reliable babysitters.", "NTA. I had a situation like that with my fil. He settled down when I asked if he cared to step outside and disrespect me again.", "Oh, let me get this straight. Your parents, who probably have more experience raising kids than you do, express some concerns about your parenting choices, and suddenly, you decide to play the victim card. Classic move, right?\r  \n\r  \nSo, your parents take care of your oldest once a week, spend time with your kids on weekends and holidays, and occasionally have sleepovers. But because they don't follow your every rule to the letter, you throw a fit. Really mature. I mean, come on, it's not like they're feeding your kids a diet of pure sugar and letting them watch horror movies.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then there's this whole chocolate saga. You make it sound like your dad committed a crime by jokingly saying he'll do what he wants when you're not around. Lighten up! It's called grandparent humor. But of course, you can't take a joke, so you blow up and turn it into a massive fight. Way to go.\r  \n\r  \nNow, you decide to cut off unsupervised time with the grandparents because they won't bow down to your parenting dictatorship. And what do you know, you're accused of blackmailing and hurting them. Surprise, surprise. Maybe, just maybe, you should consider the possibility that you're overreacting and being a bit of an asshole in this situation.\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, yeah, you might be the asshole here. It's time to take a chill pill and appreciate the free babysitting and grandparent love you're getting. They're not the enemy; they just have a different approach, and maybe, just maybe, it's worth considering their perspective.", "Esh. \n\nYour parents for the obvious reason.  \n\nYou for being inflexible.

They put you into the position of doing so by blatantly saying that when you are not around they don\u2019t have to follow your instructions for your children\u2019s care.  Now IMO, you should try to remember a time when the situation was reversed, when someone did not respect their rules and remind them how it felt by retelling the story.

There should be no unsupervised time at all with the grandparents.", "NTA. Yes, grandparents indulge grandkids, but once they've said, \"I don't have to follow your rules\", the grands have become children (and jerks).

I bought meats and veggies, rarely got fast food, and rarely bought junk snack food. Yet, when we'd visit and get ready to leave, she insisted I take oatmeal creme pies and sodas she had for the kids because she didn't need it. Really??

In this instance maybe tv/movie to help get a break is the better alternative to your parents attitude/values influencing your kids. \n\nI strongly think you should consider having or continuing to have meaningful, developmentally appropriate convos to solidify their confidence/values.  Teach how the grandparents views are harmful and why.. without throwing them under the bus. They\u2019ll do that themselves once your kids can see it for what it is but you have to do the work of front-loading them and instilling them with confidence in alternative ways and how to recognize gaslighting.

My parents seem to think that because I am their daughter (40y) I should listen to them and because they have \u201cparental authority\u201d over me, this kind of means they also have it over the grandchildren.*\n\nInstead, he doubles down.\n\n**Do not apologize to him for blowing up.  This deserved to have a reaction, because his behavior is very wrong here.**  Parenting only lasts until the children become adults.  At that point, your relationship with them changes, and you do not have authority any more.  I respect my grown kids, I do not rule them.  They are adults, and belong to themselves, not me.  Respect is how you show your grown kids love.\n\n*The result is that we now say: if you can\u2019t respect us as parents (eg not undermining is alll the time), the kids will be spending much less unsupervised time with them.

You want such people supervised at all times, so that they cannot say things to the kids that the kids will believe, without someone there to immediately correct the wrong things said, to the kids.  Kids need to know, when a person is not trusted any more.  That means one of you is always in the room with the kids, and the grandparents do not take them to other rooms away from you.   We made that mistake, of thinking if we were at their house, it would be okay.  But my MIL got the kids alone and said things they didn't know to tell us, and didn't know were not true.

They said straight out, that they won't follow your rules.**  They said that they believe they are an authority over you.  That's not true and not right. \n\nIt's not a grandparent's job to ignore and thwart the parents' rules.  It's a grandparents job to support and encourage the parents, and the grandchildren, in life.  Grandparents aren't supposed to be in control.  they are supposed to support and help.  They aren't supposed to undermine.  They are supposed to be your cheerleaders, your place to vent, your place to find sympathy and hear that you are doing a good job. \r  \n\r  \n*Are we the assholes?*\n\nNTA.

For example, I've stopped asking my dad's help with some (small) DIY around the house (think setting up a room for the kids or something), because he did not listen to me, was dismissive and did what HE wanted iso what I wanted in my house.
