For that and the smugness of what and how your father said what he said, the absolute disrespect of both you and your husband as grown adults and parents, I\u2019d be severely limiting any time with the grandkids. Simply tell the oldest that grandma and grandpa are in a timeout, because they don\u2019t respect the rules. Until they can learn to be respectful, zero time with the grandkids.

Her house, her rules. My sister and her husband showed that she was wrong by limiting contact. They felt bad about punishing our dad as he did nothing but love those kids.

It was a good lesson as she has never overstepped since and the oldest one will be 21 shortly.", "NTA, they aren\u2019t respecting your boundaries and they clearly don\u2019t understand that although upped their child, you\u2019re an adult and your children\u2019s parents which trumps grandparents. It sounds as though they conditioned you to be non confrontational and easy going to ensure you didn\u2019t have boundaries and now that you have kids, and are setting boundaries they don\u2019t know how to handle that.

They have no respect for you because you are \"peacemakers\" and have let them behave this way with no consequences.\n\nSo it's time to enforce some boundaries. These are your children and your rules are normal and reasonable. They have openly told them that your rules will not be respected if you are not there. Removing your children from their harmful and disrespectful behaviour is not blackmail.\n\nYour children should not be left unsupervised with your parents period.

Stop entreating these people and keep away from them until they come to you with their tails between their legs on this.

Put a stop to it.", "NTA by a longshot. Your parents clearly think that they don't have to respect you as an adult, let alone as the parents of your children.

You are their best teacher, and they need to learn from you and your husband how to stand up for themselves and know that their needs/wants/opinions matter. As far as limiting visitation with your folks, you're completely in the right. Your parents are overbearing and manipulative (i.e., using the word \"blackmail\" to get to you) and don't respect your parenting rules. Sorry you grew up with that. Stand firm. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou should have placed these boundaries sooner.  \n\nI understand not wanting conflict, but you are talking about the health of your children and basic parenting standards.\n\nThe sheer lack of respect your father showed your husband should have been defend much stronger by you.  He is your partner, your co parent.  These are HIS children in HIS home.  Allowing your parents to continue with their BS is just so rude to your spouse.  \n\nGrow a spine and be a strong parent and partner.", "NTA and IMO letting them get off easy. I recommend finding outside childcare & only having supervised visits with your children.  because if they disrespect you as parents to your face, they\u2019re gonna do it behind your back and they\u2019re going to raise your child the way that they want to. Until they can respect you and your boundaries and your parenting of your children I would not consider allowing any unsupervised visits.", "NO, you are NTA!

We are NC now, and all the happier for it.\n\nThey may be your parents, but they don't get to parent you anymore.  They certainly don't get to parent your husband or your children.

I say no and have repeatedly said no and they are relentless. The have lost out on many opportunities to do things with my children and our family because it\u2019s what they want or nothing. I say ok and do what I think is right and my parents are shocked when we don\u2019t follow their instructions. It was the tone and smugness that got to me most , you can\u2019t tell us no we are your parents. Yes I can because you know adult with free will. Your children, your rules and grandparents can be willing members of the family or be restricted because of their own opinions and behaviors.", "NTA, but I do think there's one aspect missing from your post. They don't show any respect to you, but do they show any respect to your children? I'd be just as worried about that, and not want to leave them unsupervised unless I was sure your children are being treated better than you are.", "NTA.\n\nyour father sounds like he\u2019s going senile, because you seem caught off guard. That leads me to believe this isn\u2019t how he was when you grew up?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to make excuses, because keeping kids with a senile person is dangerous in its own right. I also don\u2019t know how old your parents are or anything. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed a lot of people hit \u201cthat age\u201d where they just start acting out against everyone to try and force a conflict. \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad for standing up for yourself. I wouldn\u2019t let them see my kids either.", "NTA. Your boundaries are entirely reasonable. Your parents sound selfish and they like this about other things? I think you are wise to limit contact and if their whining and guilt tripping continue then cut back on the weekend visits.

He should have taken the kids out of the room, set your father straight on who is in charge and then left with the kids, explaining that the ONLY way they will see your kids again is when your father sincerely apologizes and says out loud that you and your husband\u2019s rules are the only opinions that matter when it comes to your kids.", "NTA\n\nAssuming there isn't something you are leaving out as is generally the case in IATA posts.\n\nIn the spirit of AITA, some advice: Stop talking about it in front of them, dead stop, halt, never ever bring it up.

Parents must have trust that all caregivers of young children, including grandparents (and maybe particularly grandparents ) will abide by the rules and boundaries set by the parents.

I wouldn\u2019t be talking to them period for a long time\u2026if ever. Until they clearly understood that YOU are the parents here and that they are grossly overstepping.

The next time it\u2019s brought up, I would respond with \u201cWell, we were recently informed that our rules do not apply to our children when we are not around, so we now realize that we must always be present in order to make sure that our children are raised the way that we want them raised.\u201d\n\nThe way that your dad spoke to your husband is entirely inappropriate. That alone would have resulted in me going NC until an apology was issued.\n\nI understand that you both do not like conflict, I am the same and so is my husband, however your children are a topic where you are going to have to learn to deal with the conflict. Not just concerning your parents, but all throughout life. There are going to be times when your children need an advocate and YOU are the only ones who can do it for them.

You shouldn\u2019t go from avoiding any confrontation to limiting contact.\n\nAnd that is exactly what you did with the big fight, you gave them that notice.  They chose to ignore the message.", "NTA. This is the most sensible grandparent restriction I've read. Yes, rules are different at grandparent's house, but you don't use that as a cudgel. Had he kept his mouth shut, he probably could continue to push the rules because it doesn't sound like immediate harm done (no giving peanuts to an allergic kid, etc).\n\n Once it's a taunt, that's different. It is no longer a quiet treat, it'll be actively undermining your authority. The lax rules will be framed as being correct with you guys being incorrect.", "mild YTA. grandparents are for spoiling kids. that is their role and goal in life, to send them back to you hyped up on sugar and love. Personally i think your no chocolate rule is actually depriving your youngest. but hey I am not the parent here. you need to relax a little. its ok for your grandparents to treat their grandkids, and if you didnt keep telling them your rules , then they wouldn't do their best to break them. learn to balance good upbringing with fun. And make sure you tell your children why they cant have this or that. at any age explaining your reasons to them helps them understand. they may not like or agree with it, but at least they will know your not making up rules just to make them feel bad. give a little, love a lot. and above all don't alienate your only reliable babysitters.", "NTA. I had a situation like that with my fil. He settled down when I asked if he cared to step outside and disrespect me again.", "Oh, let me get this straight. Your parents, who probably have more experience raising kids than you do, express some concerns about your parenting choices, and suddenly, you decide to play the victim card. Classic move, right?\r  \n\r  \nSo, your parents take care of your oldest once a week, spend time with your kids on weekends and holidays, and occasionally have sleepovers. But because they don't follow your every rule to the letter, you throw a fit. Really mature. I mean, come on, it's not like they're feeding your kids a diet of pure sugar and letting them watch horror movies.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then there's this whole chocolate saga. You make it sound like your dad committed a crime by jokingly saying he'll do what he wants when you're not around. Lighten up! It's called grandparent humor. But of course, you can't take a joke, so you blow up and turn it into a massive fight. Way to go.\r  \n\r  \nNow, you decide to cut off unsupervised time with the grandparents because they won't bow down to your parenting dictatorship. And what do you know, you're accused of blackmailing and hurting them. Surprise, surprise. Maybe, just maybe, you should consider the possibility that you're overreacting and being a bit of an asshole in this situation.\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, yeah, you might be the asshole here. It's time to take a chill pill and appreciate the free babysitting and grandparent love you're getting. They're not the enemy; they just have a different approach, and maybe, just maybe, it's worth considering their perspective.", "Esh. \n\nYour parents for the obvious reason.  \n\nYou for being inflexible.  Unless your kids have special needs, your kids will absolutely be fine with extra desserts or TV time.  Some of my fondness memories of my great grandparents are them sneaking me treats.

For both you and your husband...grow spines and tell the grandparents no means no or visitations will be more limited.  (see how simple that was?)", "NTA, but you are blackmailing your parents using your kids  . . . .  BUT . . . . They put you into the position of doing so by blatantly saying that when you are not around they don\u2019t have to follow your instructions for your children\u2019s care.  Now IMO, you should try to remember a time when the situation was reversed, when someone did not respect their rules and remind them how it felt by retelling the story.

You can almost hear the swallowed \u201cand as long as you are living under my roof\u2026\u201d (I\u2019m not though, just to be clear)", "It is relevant because breastfeeding a 7 year old isn't normal whatever some people would like to make us believe.", "Its relevant bc you brought it up. The way you said *breastfeeding!* made me wonder what the issue was. That\u2019s all.", "...sorry, jumped the gun on my comment.", "My parents once told my kid that when Grandma and Grandpa are around, she doesn\u2019t have to listen to mom, but Mommy has to listen to them. \n\nThey don\u2019t come around anymore.", "I agree. Love the bears!\n\nMy parents had different rules than us for when our kid stayed with them one weekend each month, but they were all ok with me. If my dad wanted to feed him Rediwhip straight from the can & my mom didn't care if he played LEGO Indiana Jones on the PlayStation until 3am, so be it! \ud83d\ude02 We were all on the same page with moral, ethical, safety, etc. issues, & they never undermined our parenting.\n\nBesides, it meant he slept *really well* on Sunday night when he came home. \ud83d\ude04", "There is a saying I use, you need to put him back in his box. You tell your father that when he steps into your home that while he is under your roof you will abide by you and your husbands rules and if he cannot do that he is not welcome. You cannot afford for him to have any bad influences on your children and cause disruption in your family. Act now and do not let him cross the boundaries.", "But she never said or suggested that she breastfed until the age of 7.", "The issue was clearly stated in her post - they don't like her parenting, starting from her decision to breastfeed during babyhood.", "NTA.\n\nThis is your circus and these are your monkeys--too much Reddit. Also, remind your parents--your house, your rules. Even if you are present, I would install camera's to monitor their behavior because they have proven untrustworthy.", "My mom thought it was cute to hop my kids up on sugar right before they came home. Got a huge kick out of it. Until we started to let the kids have sugar right before they went to Grandma's. That stopped pretty quickly.", "OP *never* said breastfeeding during babyhood. OP mentioned screentime, diets, breastfeeding all in the same sentence. So I asked a question to clarify bc breastfeeding babies isn\u2019t some off the wall thing that I\u2019ve heard *anyone* be opposed to.", "Hahaha! I did the same thing! It really worked!", "So as context: this is exactly why I mentioned it: there is nothing crazy/alternative/extreme/silly etc about breastfeeding. Yet my parents opposed it (never gave a good reason), flagged me as \u201cextreme parent\u201d for doing it and were ofcourse never supportive. Even complaining about the fact that I refused to drink alcohol during pregnancy and mostly during breastfeeding (except for the very exceptional \u2018pump & dump\u2019).", "There are a lot of people from a certain generation who are anti-breastfeeding. There was a time when formula was king, and everyone went that route. It was considered superior to breastfeeding. Many from this generation still think that way. Either because they still genuinely believe it, or because they subconsciously feel bad that they fell for the \u201cformula is better\u201d marketing and don\u2019t want to admit they could have been wrong."]}
