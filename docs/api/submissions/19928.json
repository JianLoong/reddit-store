{"id": 19928, "submission_id": "14c1fb8", "title": "AITA for embarrassing my roommate in front of everyone", "selftext": "Throwaway for privacy.\n\nI (22F) live in a college dorm with 5 other roommates, it's mixed so it's 4 boys and 2 girls. We all get along well and never had big problems besides the usual roommate stuff like who's turn is it to do the dishes. \n\nI personally don't like to shower every day, If I don't feel dirty or have spent the entire day in bed I don't shower. It's not a secret, I don't go around telling people but I don't hide it either and I'm by no means embarrassed by it. Clearly my roommates know about it. \n\nThe issue aroused a few days ago. My roommates had people over. They were playing UNO and drinking and invited me to tag along. I said yes. Even though I didn't go out that day and was in bed all day I decided to take a quick shower because it was a particularly hot day and I felt sticky. When I grabbed my things and head out to the bathroom one of my roommates, let's call him Dan (24M) told me what a miracle was that I was going to take a shower when I never did and he claimed I hated water. \n\nAs I said, I'm not embarrassed because it's true sometimes I shower every other day but that is my business, there was new people over that I hadn't had the chance to meet yet and Dan was clearly trying to make me feel embarrassed to be funny. So I decided to turn the tables. \n\nI replied that's funny coming from him when he was actually the one that could probably use a shower. People started laughing at him and he was upset. He then told me he's a guy and it's normal for guys not to shower, that I'm a girl and I should always be clean like all the other girls and that he pitty my boyfriend ho had to sleep with me. Now I took that personal. I told Dan that was a very sexist thing to say and that he was way out of line as people were witnessing the \"scene\". \n\nHe laughed it off calling me \"a drama queen that can't take the truth\" so I told Dan he was \"a whiny attention whore who enjoys making fun of people but can't handle it when a girl calls him out in front of everyone\". He was furious and stormed off the place. I showered and went on with my night, actually had a lot of fun, got to know new people who were sympathetic and on my side, they spent all night talking about the trash Dan was. \n\nHe blew up my phone with texts accusing me of being and asshole for embarrassing him in front of his friends and he expected an apology. He is not speaking to me but I genuinely believe he doesn't deserve one, at the very least I do. But I could be wrong.

Dan couldn\u2019t take it and got mad you stood up for yourself. Good for you! Also, showering daily isn\u2019t good for your hair and skin, so keep doing what you\u2019re doing it\u2019s totally fine", "NTA - it sounds like assessment of him was correct.  sexist, misogynistic, and he can dish it out but not take it.  good for you standing up for yourself.", "NTA makes no sense for him to say guys don't need to shower everyday.", "NTA but I\u2019d be careful if you\u2019re living with this guy. That was pretty out of line and hypocritical. He sounds like he has issues.\n\nLike, if you\u2019re not stinky to the point where it offends other people and you\u2019re generally a hygienic roommate otherwise why does he feel like he has a right to comment on your bathing habits? Or your sex life??? Be wary.", "NTA. Dan started shit he couldn\u2019t finish. He should have kept his mouth shut and minded his own business. Good on you for putting him in his place.", "NTA. He tried to poke fun and couldn\u2019t handle it when you didn\u2019t act embarrassed. You\u2019re right that his comment was sexist. Hopefully he learns to live without the apology because it isn\u2019t deserved IMO.", "He started it so no. The things he said about women needing to shower everyday but not men is double standards and very sexist. You were in the right girl. He probably got in his feelings because he\u2019s childish and immature instead of moving on. You aren\u2019t at fault you didn\u2019t start it, you just ended it.", "NTA \n\nIf you can't take the heat stay out of the kitchen.  He started and couldn't finish.", "Lol damn you got him and he knows it. What a sexist loser. Don\u2019t apologize because he\u2019s the one that started all this and continued it. He could of let it go after your first retort and that wouldn\u2019t been it but then he had to get sexist. He\u2019s just mad no one is on his side and no one should be.\n\nNTA", "Good for you for outwitting him. You showed the perfect amount of backbone. Kudos.\n\nIf he was mature, well, one, he wouldn't have made sexist or ostracizing statements, but two, he would've realized that *he* embarrassed himself and that you were simply sticking up for yourself, which you had every right to do.\n\nHonestly, college is the time and the place to make mistakes like Dan did. It's low stakes! They're embarrassing and they stick with you, but that's how you learn. It's not like he said it someplace where it could hurt his career or his future. It's a good sign that he's embarrassed. He will remember it far more keenly than anyone else present, and if he chooses to grow from this, he will make less boneheaded comments moving forward.\n\nYou don't owe him an apology. You don't owe him the chance to apologize or to help him find the lesson here. But there's an opportunity for him to learn from this if you and/or your roommates think he deserves your time or attention in explaining it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Can\u2019t take what\u2019s being dished out? Don\u2019t open your flap. You called him out on his misogyny. I\u2019d be embarrassed to call him a friend.", "Ugh. He sounds awful.

That's not a joke. That's bullying.\n\nWhen you confronted him, he doubled down and escalated, \"I feel sorry for your boyfriend.\"\n\nAnd then he pivoted toward being openly sexist, \"It's normal for guys to not shower.\"\n\nAt any point, he could have shut his mouth and avoided embarrassing himself further. But he chose to keep talking. You are NTA at all.", "NTA    it's becoming so common, that the person who starts talking shit ends up butthurt when the other person quips back, it's funny.\n\nYou don't owe him, or his bruised ego, anything.", "NTA\n\nAlso. Dan needs to get his misogyny out of his hygiene. Men often smell more and faster because of testosterone... So him saying men don't need to be clean is... Oof \ud83d\udc40\n\n what is it about misogynistic twats thinking being dirty is somehow masculine?? As if wiping your butt and showering is inherently feminine!?

Probably watches One Punch Man and roots for the monsters.", "NTA- these people don\u2019t even like Dan but they accepted you. He tried to put you down because you were new and he was trying to look cool in front of them but it backfired. Very nice job and they were probably happy you replaced him for the evening\n\nAlso why is he monitoring your shower schedule?", "NTA.\n\nAlso, shame on me, too - such a dirty woman for not showering daily! Jeez.", "Yup. We're gross.", "Yeah, I shower twice a day if I am working hard, and if my wife skips a day she seems as fresh as if she just took one.", "I shower at least once a day. My gf will get pretty stinky after about three days, but she works in the garden a lot.", "NTA There\u2019s no way someone would get this upset over a comment like that. Especially after they made the initial comment. Stormed out of his own place? I highly doubt it", "NTA. If he wants someone to apologize, he needs to start with one to you. He was trying to look like the big man making fun of you and you answered in kind.  The only difference is you can take a joke but he is a baby who cannot handle what he tries to dish out.", "NTA.  Just two children trying to embarrass each other.  Kinda expected.", "NTA\n\nPeople are surprised when the dog bites them after they tease it.", "NTA he tried it and found out you weren't the one to mess with. He also got the truth told and now people are probably really looking at his character. No apologies will be happening keep on moving on. Who needs a friend or associate like that anyway.", "NTA", "NTA. Holy shit, it's the *real* Dirty Dan!", "NTA. Dish it , take it.", "NTA.  He's upset that when he tried you embarrass you, you're the one who ended up embarrassing him.  He could've just kept his mouth shut and *nobody* would have been embarrassed.", "NTA, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.", "Nta. He embarrassed himself.  And I don't shower every day either", "You should apologize.   Tell him \"I'm sorry you feel that way.\"", "NTA... he brought it up. \nShower when dirty is a fine principle to live by. This differs for everyone.  I was surprised when my doctor advised me not to shower every day as it was bad for the skin", "I genuinely don't know why he cares that much, if my boyfriend wasn't like, one of his best friends, I'd think he's trying to get my attention.", "And your bf is ok with Dan talking to you like that?", "Yeah, this dude is all of the marinara flags.", "Esh. You only suck because \"spent all night talking about the trash Dan was\". Rather you personally trashed talked him or just listened, thats not cool. I do love that you gave back better than he did. I cant stand ppl who put others down to make themselves look/feel better (which brings us back to why you suck again). Next time, it makes you look even better if you either change the subject or say something like you do not want to let him spoil any more of your time. If they are willing to trash him behind his back, they will probably be willing to do it to you too.

As a guy, your sass is savage. Well done. Considering how the others took it and how they talked about Dan after that, seems like they also hate him.", "Nta he try to embarrassed you. He's only mad because you spin it right back at him and called him out on him. You don't owe him anything. Dont apologize.", "> He is not speaking to me \n\nIs this supposed to be a bad thing?\n\nNTA", "NTA \nI shower every other day too because it\u2019s better for your hair/skin unless I workout or do something similar. He is sexist and mad you called him on it, I don\u2019t think he deserves an apology.", "agreed NTA, I was raised hearing that you're supposed to take a shower every day but you can wash your hair with shampoo and soap on alternating days, but then again I live in a really hot and humid area and I'm constantly outside so take it with a grain of salt. also dan was totally sexist/misogynistic lmao rekt idk y ppl say girls are drama queens it's not a gender thing oof"]}
