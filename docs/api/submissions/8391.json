She tried to get you to back her up on this terrible behavior of hers. Why should you reward this kind of behavior with a vacation?", "NTA. Things we don't talk about:\n\n1. Bruno.\n2. Fight Club.\n3. Hitler in a way that makes light of the real evil he did.\n\nYou were right not to back her up. Hopefully your actions will serve as a wake-up call for her.", "NTA. It\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d teenager stuff but your sister also tried to put you against your parents. You can always backtrack if you feel guilty but you aren\u2019t obligated to cater to someone that\u2019s being an AH", "NTA- There's being a rebellious teenager and then there's being an brat and frankly a crap person. She doesn't get to reap the rewards talking lile that to your parents, maybe now she'll think about what she says and how she acts. I was an ass at 17 but I wouldn't compare my father to Hitler because he told me to feed a cat.", "NTA.\n\nIf you and your sister are close enough to go on a trip together, however, I suggest you try to have a serious talk with her about her behavior. If she was a good and level-headed kid before, that kind of behavior could be a red flag for any number of issues that it sounds like no one is helping with. If you want to be a good big brother, try to talk to her, preferably in person, to explain yourself and try to understand what's happening.", "NTA. I mean, maybe at 14 that \"joke\" would be expected, not ok and your reaction would have still been fine at that age. But at 17, my god she's an ah. That's just straight up horrid. By that age I assume she's had education on WW2. Once you have that education, there is absolutely no excuse anymore. This is a very fair punishment I think. And it's good your the one doing it because if her parents did she'd just see it as more reason to hate them. If you didn't do this, you'd be enabling her.\n\nAs for the parent disrespect, just out of curiosity because you are a biased source, what are her exact complaints? You mention her not turning the tap off and forgetting to feed the cat, are they all extremely childish things like that? I want you to go into detail here. You might have been raised by the same people, but there are so many stories of the older golden child and the scapegoat younger, or someone having sexist parents, I just want to double check we have all the information. What does she mean in her head by him being \"a dictator?\"", "NTA you chose not to enable her poor behavior when she asked and then you chose not to deal with her on a trip. Plus she is actually grounded, so she\u2019s really not supposed to go out and have fun anyway. She sounds horribly spoiled.", "NTA. As a Jewish person, your sister sucks. As a human, that's not normal teenager stuff, that's poorly disciplined, selfish AH stuff.", "NTA but you said your dad grounded her so it seems like that should've taken care of the problem without you saying anything.", "You don't need to feel like crap. Bad manners and spite should never be ignored. You were right and what you did sent a message that hateful behavior would not be tolerated. NTA.", "NTA. I know for sure that I wouldn't want to go on a trip with someone if they treated their parents like that, for absolutely no reason. Even more so if it was my sibling to my parents.\n\nShe needs to learn respect. I don't know anyone that age who acts that childish. Especially with the Hitler remark. Disgusting.", "Nta BUT if this is recent behaviour than a checkin with your sister might be worth doing. It suggests something is going on for her. Maybe something with the parents. Maybe from something else. Either way she\u2019s acting out and there is likely a source behind it and that source may not be super great which means she needs help/support", "INFO: Was this in reference to how she was already treating your parents or were you mad about something else that came up? \n\n\"I don't like getting between my parents and her, **and I was pissed at her already**, so I just told her she wasn't coming Saturday and got ready to leave.\"", "NTA - comparing your father to Hitler for asking to feed the cat is a massive slap in the face to those who suffered and died at his hands. You had every right to tell her no more vacation. Actions have consequences, this is hers. Maybe she can spend that time reading a history book about the Holocaust and come up with an apology.", "NTA. Sounds like what\u2019s going on is she feels lesser than for the first time. You said you two have always been like twins, but then you go and start living this cool new young adult life, and she\u2019s left behind with rules and parents.  The resentment has built up to an unhealthy degree and it\u2019s coming out in outbursts.  A lot of teens start to hate being told what to do, since they\u2019re so close to independence they can taste it.  The way she\u2019s acting out isn\u2019t cool but I do think she needs some understanding in the way you all respond.", "NTA and I hope you stick to your guns and just go with your parents. Your sister needs a reality check.", "NTA and I second that this isn't normal teenage disrespect. However--and I don't want to scare you or be dramatic--I wonder if your sister had something happen to her recently. My brother went through a similar thing; it was like a flip had switched and he suddenly began treating our parents terribly, way beyond normal teenage rebellion. It turns out he had gotten into drugs which also exacerbated his mental illnesses, and then had some traumatic experiences which resulted in him taking his anger out on our parents. It's common for kids to lash out at their parents/caregivers when something traumatic has happened (especially when they feel they can trust those caregivers--its like \"I know you'll love me no matter what, so I'll scream at you\"). Not saying it's okay or that it can't be changed, just saying it's something that happens.\n\nI'm NOT diagnosing your sister with anything nor saying that what she said was excusable. But I just wonder if something beyond teenage angst happened to make her start acting this way. I sincerely hope she's just being an asshole and that she'll grow out of it.", "ESH your sister is definitely out of line but it isnt up to you to punish her especially since your father already did that by grounding her. Is there any way to move the trip to after the grounding period? That way you can respect their discipline but still do the trip?", "YTA for involving yourself in disciplining your sister as if you're an authority figure", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
