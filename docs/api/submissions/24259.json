Kids need guidance from parents, and they\u2019re definitely failing at it. Trust me they won\u2019t change when they grow up. If you don\u2019t stand your ground now, it\u2019ll only get worse. They\u2019ll start pulling the \u201cwe\u2019re family\u201d card. They don\u2019t like boundaries bec they feel entitled. It\u2019s not even abt being family or not, it\u2019s abt respect and just being decent human being. I bet you they want to bring the kids over more so it becomes more of your problem than theirs.\n\nMy ex\u2019s family was like this. We hosted Thanksgiving dinner once and his sister and boyfriend just got up and left everything on the table like they have a slave to pick up after themselves. Didn\u2019t push the chairs back in, didn\u2019t say goodbye, they literally left the house not just the table. But when we come over to theirs, I at least put my plates on the sink and push my chair back in, and yet I\u2019m the one who \u201cnever helps cleaning up\u201d.

As a plus note, they won't be asked to babysit either . \n\n>The correct thing to say would have been \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d.\n\nThey ruined his persian rug.

This is completely abhorrent.", "Ding! Ding! Ding!!!  Wish I had an award left to give.\n\nI've long thought that many parents of errant children enjoy watching their children run amok in public, or in other people's homes.  \n\n*Hostile* is very descriptive of this behavior, as is *entitlement*.\n\nI've long wondered why people put up with it.  When children are that far out of line they need to be told that they are violating the \"house rules.\"  \n\nProbably I'm an old meanie, but I would tell them that they had to either leave or the children needed to *stay on their parents' laps*.\n\nNTA", "\"We'll see you soon!

Parents are *responsible* for their kids, including cleaning fees when their kids damage stuff. My two year old knows food stays in the kitchen and dining room on the hard floors. Occasionally I have to herd food filled fists back away from the carpet when something in the living room is exciting. At age *two* a kid knows smashed orange on the floor is \"messy, need towel, wipe, ok, pwees-tank-u-wel-come.\" My toddler is confident and also self aware of actions and knows social expectations for what is ok. Our children are observing what we do and listening to, \"Wait, you need to eat at the table\" and \"We need to clean up our spills\" and \"No food on the carpet\" for their whole lives. Yes, in my house there's a pink stain by the window. That was my bad for setting something down in the living room within child reach. We did our best to clean up together and finished eating in the dining room. If they let their children demolish someone else's house, what must their walls, floors, furniture, etc. look like?\n\nNTA and I doubt these *responsible* parents will take *responsibility* for the cleaning of OP's rug in the name of...

BIL is the AH here", "That's what I am saying", "It's a normal toddler behavior AND it should have been nipped in the bud by the parents.", "I won't. But I won't call it weird. Toddlers do this kind of stuff and parents have to stop it, because that's how you make your kids grow up", "but like... it's your house and your stuff they were trashing. it would've been *absolutely fine* for you to stop the kids or say something to them. not your job, i know, but it seems so crazy that you and your wife didn't do anything about it either.\n\nNTA, obviously. i just wouldn't have been able to let them terrorize my house, no matter whose kids they are.", "Their parents are confusing confidence with entitledness. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIf your comment comes up again, tell your in-laws that they better get accustomed to comments like that because their lack of parenting will attract more of them (frequently) from others. I hope they like being lonely because no one is going to invite them over if they don't parent their children. \n\nAlso, they will learn fast that kids who have never received constructive criticism will be filled with anxiety as they navigate the world outside their home.

There is no lie.", "That\u2019s incorrect. \n\nI understand how you want to blame the kids and the bad parenting.

They should be learning that acting like a hellion doesn\u2019t get you invited back for playdates. It\u2019s not about protecting their feelings, it\u2019s about teaching them right from wrong. Protecting babies from the truth leads to stupid, spoiled adults.", "They are, I agree. But if the parents aren't going to do anything about it, the kids, as unaware of what's going on as they are, are the only ones that really can.
