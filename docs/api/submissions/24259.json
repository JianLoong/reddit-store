I feel horrible that she went through all that, especially as an older child and then a teenager, etc., she was so sick by the time they figured it out that she wasn\u2019t able to even care for herself, attend school, etc., she never had the chance to even move out on her own and experience life. I\u2019m SURE SHE NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO DATE, etc., she was very sick, but also, HELLO, I might pee the bed if I stay over, is that cool??\u201d \n\nOBVIOUSLY HER PARENTS SHOULD HAVE HAD HER CHECKED OUT LONG BEFORE HER LATE TEENS, EARLY 20\u2019s!! Like before she reached double digits AT ALL! You don\u2019t just pee the bed your entire freaking life for NO REASON! She was the least hellish of the 3 but she truly was awful as well, she spent WAYYYY too much time with those heathen boys!\n\nI wouldn\u2019t doubt that at LEAST ONE OF THE BOYS IS IN PRISON, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me for even a second!! Hard to say though, we gave them the BIG GOODBYE when my parents divorced, thank God! We always kept in touch with their Grandparents, my Auntie & Uncle, WE LOVED THEM, that\u2019s how we got the scoop about what was going on with her.

You save everyone so much misery by not letting it become habitual in the first place.", "Visiting family, if I was not wearing 'Sunday Best' I was not allowed to sit directly on upholstered furniture, had to sit on a plastic bag.

NTA, BIL can learn to grow up and be an actual parent, much more an adult.", "Something like this happened to me with my SIL and her kids. They can be absolute brats\u2014old enough to do better, but being absolutely rotten when expected to behave. They are ungrateful and rude on top of it all, and their parents do not discipline them.

It was half \"how did you do that?!\" and half \"dammit, my kids don't listen to anything\".\n\nWhile I was responsible for precisely none of her behaviour (that would be the absolutely excellent parenting by my sister) I did experience a moment of vicarious smugness that I still recall clearly - and she's a teenager now!", "My son had ADHD as a child, diagnosed around age of 3.

Don\u2019t make a big deal, don\u2019t make a fuss, and don\u2019t make it as if the kid is a failure for being a kid. \n\nMy kids know to say sorry and clean up after spills. I also know scolding kids for every little thing puts anxiety in everything they do and can lead to issues with perfectionism. So I take a no big deal approach. Correct, guide and exhibit behavior. I have met plenty of parents who make spilling milk a yelling contest and I am not going to do that. Breaking things is getting to places where gentle hands are not being used and that needs a discussion and I feel I would need to offer to pay for replacement. \n\nI was responding to what was described and used the wrong word.
