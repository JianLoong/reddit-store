{"id": 16579, "submission_id": "13aavhs", "title": "AITA for telling my husband he\u2019s being a bad father?", "selftext": "I 30 female am married to my husband Jack 37 male for 3 years. We have a daughter together Hannah 3 and my step daughter Ashley (his daughter from a precious relationship) is 10. \n\nHannah started dance classes this year. This is her first year performing at a recital and we were all very excited. We had tickets for all 3 shows (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and couldn\u2019t wait to watch her perform. \n\nAshley found out earlier this week she\u2019d be performing for her school chorus. The girl who originally was going to do it got sick. Ashley performance was Sunday at the same time as Hannah\u2019s dance recital that night. \n\nAshley told me how it would mean a lot to her if we went. So I worked it out with the dance school that Hannah would go the recital that night with my parents and Jack and I would go watch Ashley performance. (I would have pulled Hannah from dance but I was afraid she would want to sing during Ashley\u2019s performance and Ashley should be able to have her own moment.)\n\nWhen I told my husband he was so upset. He said he wanted to be there for all of Hannah\u2019s performances and we shouldn\u2019t be pawning her off on my parents. I said my parents were going to the show anyway and her bestfriends mom will help her with the costume (I helped her daughter the day prior). He said I was crazy if I thought sending our 3 year old without us was a good idea. She\u2019s stayed with her grandparents and gone to do things with them before. \n\nI told him he was being stupid and that Ashley needed her dad too. He refused to go and went with Hannah and told me to meet him at the dance recital. I went to Ashley\u2019s performance instead. While I was there I was saying hello to Ashley\u2019s mother and ended up finding out Jack never answered her about if he could bring her new black shoes. Ashley didn\u2019t realize until today the ones at her moms house were too small (doesn\u2019t wear them often) and I didn\u2019t want her to feel different from the other kids. Luckily I got there early and there\u2019s a shoe store down the street so I went to buy some and told her mom to keep them there so she has a pair at both houses now. \n\nWhen I went home my husband and I got into a huge argument. He said I let down Hannah and she was sad. I told him to keep in mind she\u2019s 3 she ALWAYS wants us and then forgets about it in 5 minutes when she sees something else she wants. I told him he needs to remember we have another child to also think about not just Hannah. I told him he was an awful father for not showing up for Ashley and for not even mentioning she needed shoes. Even if he wasn\u2019t going the least he could do was bring her the shoes. Him and I are still arguing and he\u2019s sleeping on the couch. He won\u2019t even talk to me and honestly I don\u2019t want to talk to him either. \n\nI feel like I might have crossed the line calling him a bad father. I was really angry. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: \n\nI just realized I didn\u2019t say why the shoes were mentioned. He asked me what that charge was for and when I told him he was mad I bought shoes for her mothers house. He said he pays enough in child support and buy her things for our house so it\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThis morning Jack and I took the girls out for breakfast. During breakfast Jack was telling Ashley about Hannah dance recitals. Ashley wasn\u2019t able to make the recitals because she had practice for chorus the other two nights. Ashley asked if that\u2019s why he missed her singing and Jack said yes. Ashley said her mom recorded it and maybe we could all watch it together one night so he could see. Jack made a comment about her mother. I didn\u2019t hear exactly what he said but by Ashley\u2019s reaction and his face I could tell it wasn\u2019t kind. Ashley then went to the bathroom and I told him to cut the comments and that it wasn\u2019t necessary. I went to check on Ashley and she was crying. \n\nSo I texted Jack and told him I was taking both the girls out for the day until he could figure out an apology to Ashley. I told him the same way he wouldn\u2019t want someone talking about him or I to Hannah he shouldn\u2019t be doing that to Ashley\u2019s mother. He could either get therapy and apologize to his daughter or I\u2019d be going to my parents when I get home after taking the girls out. \n\nWhen I got the girls in my car I called Ashley\u2019s mom and picked her up. The 4 of us will be at the amusement park today. \n\nJack has been texting me apologizing all morning. I\u2019ve already told him I\u2019m not the person he needs to apologize to.", "created_utc": 1683428700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13aavhs/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_being_a_bad_father/", "score": 4323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe if he wanted to be there for Hannah he could have gone and one of the grandparents could have gone to Ashley's performance with you. Navigating what's right is so HARD when there's no clear right or wrong. For me, if he felt like he should have been there for one thing, he should given that opportunity without having to be told he needs to do this because of that. I do agree sometimes, as adult we should put our feelings aside but we shouldn't feel wrong for feeling a certain way about things. Who knows what he promised Hannah and felt like he needed to keep that because Ashley's performance was so last minute because someone got sick. It's a hard situation all around but conversations would help like asking if Ashley is ok with a grandparent/parent being there and also asking why Jack was taking it so hard. I don't think anyone was the A\\*\\*hole because parenting is hard and there's no clear cut way to do things. Take a breath, communicate, try to understand and just be there, for the kids and each other.", ">I feel like I might have crossed the line calling him a bad father.\n\nYou crossed the line quite a bit earlier than that. ESH.\n\nThis whole mess happened because you made a major unilateral decision for the two of you (how to split the events). For whatever reason, your husband saw the issue differently. That is mostly immaterial. It's unfortunate but such mistakes happen fairly often.\n\nYou each then disagreed with each other in a way that was brutal. \"Crazy.\" \"Stupid.\" \"Awful father.\" In no way were the words used by either of you justifiable.

The stress caused by interacting with the ex can make it easier to avoid rather than deal with.\n\nI'm not excusing him however but I do feel that could be an issue worth addressing as he may not even be aware.

I think you need to, when you're able to be non-emotional about it, have a conversation about what happened, especially if that's a symptom of any broader issues you see in how he treats his daughters.

Another example is when I got Hannah\u2019s ears pierced Ashley also wanted hers done so I called her mom and not just do it even though my husband said he didn\u2019t mind. He\u2019s her father but she\u2019s also her mother and should have an equal say.", "Guy needs to sort his shit out, before he ends up paying two lots of child support.", ">\tWhen I got the girls in my car I called Ashley\u2019s mom and picked her up. The 4 of us will be at the amusement park today.\n\nParents take note. This is what peak performance looks like.", "Info: was he more or less a deadbeat dad until you came along and pushed for renewed contact?", "NTA sounds like he wants to cut his losses and forget about his first family and focus on family 2.0 only. Good on you for not letting him get away with it.", "At least Hannah has 2 good moms", "Oh my goodness thank you!", "He was an active father before he met me. That\u2019s why I was surprised when he started acting this way.", "I'm telling you, it's because once you hit like 6 years old or so, you start having a mind of your own and you don't just obey, they lose interest. It sucks but it's completely true in my experience and what I've witnessed. I hate that you're probably going to watch it happen to your daughter as well", "From what I understand Ashley had a good pair of black shoes at dad's house so ex just asked him to bring them to the choir thing. OP then bought a pair quickly from down the road so Ashley could have a good pair at each home.", "You are correct. I just saw the edits about him making a comment about Ashley\u2019s mom. He\u2019s totally punishing her to hurt the mom. I\u2019m soooo glad OP is on Ashley\u2019s side, otherwise life in her fathers home would be abject hell. I clapped when I read OP telling her husband when he tried to apologize TO HER that she\u2019s not the one who\u2019s owed an apology. I have a strong feeling that if it wasn\u2019t for OP, her hubby would just straight up abandon Ashley", "Dylan Mulvaney does a lot, thank you very much, and SHE has been through a lot as well. All we see is influencers lives on the media. We have no clue what goes on behind the scenes or what they do in their lives that they don\u2019t post about. I\u2019m sure sweet Dylan has a fulfilling life outside of posting to her followers.\nAnd as the other person said, you sound like a raging idiot possibly projecting insecurities. No one gets a free pass because they\u2019re pretty - they still have to work to get to a comfortable place in life", "idk why people treat their baby like their own doll or object possession whose body they are free to modify and create irreversible cosmetic scars on. like she's a Christmas tree for you to decorate. you do not own your child's body. its mystifying to me. idk how you can be so sensitive and balanced in your thinking about other things and go ahead with that. issues of sovereignty of self and personal autonomy aside its impossible to properly place a piercing on a body that is growing so quickly. i just don't get it. i think it's just really culturally normalised so people feel like that's some kind of excuse that they don't need to question it. you come out and say it as though it couldn't possibly be a conflict. it's so sad and messed up.", "Hannah actually asked for her ears to be pierced like mommies. She even picked her own earrings.", "She's 3.", "Thank you for loving your step daughter as your own and supporting her birth mom as well. There are so many evil step parent posts on this sub and the fact that you care so much restores my faith in humanity by a lot. Obviously NTA, but I just wanted to say this.", "So then in this case I\u2019m pretty confused. If your husband is usually an active participant in the coparenting relationship, it\u2019s strange that he\u2019s making this one thing his hill to die on. I mean no offense, but a dance recital for a three year old really isn\u2019t that big of a deal? I guess my next question would be if there has been any other incidents recently that you can think of. Things like Ashley picking up an expensive new activity, staying extra days w her mom, etc.", "\"I think it's just really culturally normalized\"... Don't pass judgements on things you aren't familiar with. Just because it doesn't sit right in your brain doesn't mean it's wrong. There could be many things you do that don't sit right with people from other cultures. The fact that this is *gasp* a piercing doesn't make it worse.", "As a stepchild who's stepmother couldn't have given two hoots about her, THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for caring and advocating so strongly for your stepdaughter.\n\nObviously NTA.", "I also wonder if he's unhappy with how OP and his ex are so close.", "I did ballet, jazz, and tap when I was 4. Don\u2019t remember much about it, but my parents were never ones to push me to do something I wasn\u2019t happy with. My sister was in the same in the same recitals and my brothers were babies, though. They didn\u2019t really need to split the time.", "That's how we did it - the littles were on first, and then the actual dancers came out to do their thing. (Although my dance teacher had to hustle me off the stage because I was having too good a time and didn't want to leave, lol.)", "I\u2019m talking about the amount of performances being a lot for a 3 year old. When my daughter was at the other studio that did 3 different performances, it also included three different dress rehearsals. It was a lot. My daughter is at the studio about 15-20+ hours a week now but she\u2019s 13 and it\u2019s her choice. She can handle 3 day performances, now, but there is a reason why the minis don\u2019t participate in a lot at that age. It\u2019s just too much.", "I can't believe how amazing of a parent you are. If all parents and guardians were like you, none of us would have trauma.", "I was talking about that, too. Did you read where I said they didn\u2019t push me to do more than I was happy with? I know I was 4 instead of 3, but still. I also mentioned my parents.", "I\u2019m talking about OP and that situation and the load of dance in serious studios for young kids. I\u2019m not sure how we got on the topic of you?", "No. You were talking about your children. Reread your own comment.", "Lot of people pierce their little kids ears. Its even common to see infants with pierced ears."]}
