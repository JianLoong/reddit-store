We have a daughter together Hannah 3 and my step daughter Ashley (his daughter from a precious relationship) is 10. \n\nHannah started dance classes this year. This is her first year performing at a recital and we were all very excited. We had tickets for all 3 shows (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and couldn\u2019t wait to watch her perform. \n\nAshley found out earlier this week she\u2019d be performing for her school chorus. The girl who originally was going to do it got sick. Ashley performance was Sunday at the same time as Hannah\u2019s dance recital that night. \n\nAshley told me how it would mean a lot to her if we went. So I worked it out with the dance school that Hannah would go the recital that night with my parents and Jack and I would go watch Ashley performance. (I would have pulled Hannah from dance but I was afraid she would want to sing during Ashley\u2019s performance and Ashley should be able to have her own moment.)\n\nWhen I told my husband he was so upset. He said he wanted to be there for all of Hannah\u2019s performances and we shouldn\u2019t be pawning her off on my parents. I said my parents were going to the show anyway and her bestfriends mom will help her with the costume (I helped her daughter the day prior). He said I was crazy if I thought sending our 3 year old without us was a good idea. She\u2019s stayed with her grandparents and gone to do things with them before. \n\nI told him he was being stupid and that Ashley needed her dad too. He refused to go and went with Hannah and told me to meet him at the dance recital. I went to Ashley\u2019s performance instead. While I was there I was saying hello to Ashley\u2019s mother and ended up finding out Jack never answered her about if he could bring her new black shoes. Ashley didn\u2019t realize until today the ones at her moms house were too small (doesn\u2019t wear them often) and I didn\u2019t want her to feel different from the other kids. Luckily I got there early and there\u2019s a shoe store down the street so I went to buy some and told her mom to keep them there so she has a pair at both houses now. \n\nWhen I went home my husband and I got into a huge argument. He said I let down Hannah and she was sad. I told him to keep in mind she\u2019s 3 she ALWAYS wants us and then forgets about it in 5 minutes when she sees something else she wants. I told him he needs to remember we have another child to also think about not just Hannah. I told him he was an awful father for not showing up for Ashley and for not even mentioning she needed shoes. Even if he wasn\u2019t going the least he could do was bring her the shoes. Him and I are still arguing and he\u2019s sleeping on the couch. He won\u2019t even talk to me and honestly I don\u2019t want to talk to him either. \n\nI feel like I might have crossed the line calling him a bad father. I was really angry. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: \n\nI just realized I didn\u2019t say why the shoes were mentioned. He asked me what that charge was for and when I told him he was mad I bought shoes for her mothers house. He said he pays enough in child support and buy her things for our house so it\u2019s ridiculous.", "created_utc": 1683428700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13aavhs/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_being_a_bad_father/", "score": 1444, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re completely right. Hannah will forget it in 5 minutes. Ashley, will definitely remember the solo she was so proud to get; and how it was not attended by her father. Hannah has a single stable home. Ashley goes between two. \n\nThis co-parenting needs improvement so it doesn\u2019t damage Ashley\u2019s mental health later on-she will blame herself/wonder why she\u2019s not enough for her dad. Even being the star of a performance is not enough for her dads affection/attention.

You obviously go to the one performance of a 10yr old vs 3/3 of a 3yr old who won't even remember it.

Hannah will not remember this but Ashley will. If your husband keeps this up and Ashley goes NC with him, I bet my ass he will play victim.", "NTA, he is a bad father if he cares more about not spending any more money than he has to on his daughter to spite his ex. His daughter needs shoes for each household no matter who buys them . She's the one benefitting from you getting her shoes, and he should care and appreciate that!", "NTA your husband is being a bad father and he needs to do better.", "NTA, it sounds like he is upset with having to pay child support to his ex.

There are kinder ways to explain his bad behavior without stooping to name calling.  It would have been much better to explain how he is being \"unfair\" or \"hurtful towards Ashley\".", "What a tough situation to be in as adults right? Maybe if he wanted to be there for Hannah he could have gone and one of the grandparents could have gone to Ashley's performance with you. Navigating what's right is so HARD when there's no clear right or wrong. For me, if he felt like he should have been there for one thing, he should given that opportunity without having to be told he needs to do this because of that. I do agree sometimes, as adult we should put our feelings aside but we shouldn't feel wrong for feeling a certain way about things. Who knows what he promised Hannah and felt like he needed to keep that because Ashley's performance was so last minute because someone got sick. It's a hard situation all around but conversations would help like asking if Ashley is ok with a grandparent/parent being there and also asking why Jack was taking it so hard. I don't think anyone was the A\\*\\*hole because parenting is hard and there's no clear cut way to do things. Take a breath, communicate, try to understand and just be there, for the kids and each other.", ">I feel like I might have crossed the line calling him a bad father.\n\nYou crossed the line quite a bit earlier than that. ESH.\n\nThis whole mess happened because you made a major unilateral decision for the two of you (how to split the events). For whatever reason, your husband saw the issue differently. That is mostly immaterial. It's unfortunate but such mistakes happen fairly often.\n\nYou each then disagreed with each other in a way that was brutal. \"Crazy.\" \"Stupid.\" \"Awful father.\" In no way were the words used by either of you justifiable. This is what made the conflict personal and bitter, and something that probably will have lasting effects for months if not years to come.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why could he not go see Ashley's performance while you stayed with Hannah?", "NTA and it's so funny I have an evil stepmom followed by a wonderful stepmom on my feed.\n\nYour husband is 100% in the wrong and Ashley is lucky to have you.\n\nAs a stepmom myself, I'm wondering if your husband's relationship with his ex is being projected onto Ashley? \n\nMy husband, for the longest time, had an incredibly contentious relationship with his ex so it would make it harder to push to see his daughter because he constantly has to deal with his ex in order to do so. Thankfully she seems to be much improved post therapy and is admitting to toxic behavior. \n\nMy husband would never take it out on his daughter but I can see why some parents sadly do. The stress caused by interacting with the ex can make it easier to avoid rather than deal with.\n\nI'm not excusing him however but I do feel that could be an issue worth addressing as he may not even be aware. It's possible he wants to redo parenting as he feels guilty for failing his daughter with his ex so wants one kid to think he's the best dad ever instead of dealing with this guilt around Ashley.", "NTA- does your husband realize that the entire reason the little ones do 3 nights of shows is because they know families have things going on and a lot of kids can't make all?", "NTA and your stepdaughter is lucky to have someone in her corner.\n\nI just can't get over the fact that 3 year olds have a 3 night dance recital. What is the point?", "Wtf? Ashley isn't your biological child, and yet you're the one that has to stand up for her? Yeah, he's a lousy dad. NTA", "NTA\n\nTake note this is how he will treat your daughter when you divorce and he has a new family", "NTA- RUN", "I 100% expected you to be the bad guy here (we've all read/seen Cinderella), but I just want to thank you for being there for Ashley. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You called your husband a bad father because he is.", "Definitely NTA and thank you for looking out for your stepdaughter", "NTA", "NTA", "You care more about Ashley, than her father does. Well done for stepping up.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - and OP, you are getting a good look at how he moves on.  Lots of concerning attitudes coming from your husband.", "You are a wonderful stepmom. I just wanted you to know that.", "Raise your hand if you *also* thought the child he was favoring was Ashley.", "Unfortunately,  she may also grow to resent her little sister due to the actions of her father . . . Hopefully the fact that her stepmother ensured that one of them was present will help to mitigate a lot of the resentment build-up.", "Found the awful father.", ">Navigating what's right is so HARD when there's no clear right or wrong.\n\nfortunately in this situation there was. The right thing was to go to the choir performance and only an awful person would be unsure", "He\u2019s paying child support to his ex for Ashley. He was mad that OP went and bought Ashley new shoes to stay at the ex\u2019s house.", "His priorities seem out of whack. There were 3 nights when he could see the recital but only one to see his other daughter sing. \n\nIf he can't give you a good explanation about why he's done this, I'd strongly recommend you think twice before having more kids with him.", "NTA, keep being a good parent to both those kids. It definitely meant alot to Ashley that you were able to make it. Those choices will have to be made and time split between both kids for... We'll ever really.", "When I did dance show we had shows 3 nights in a row. My dance school was aged 3-18 so usually the 3-4 year olds had their one dance as the second one of the show so they could go home early, I think all the under 7s were before the interval so if it went too late for them they could leave then. And once you were 18 you were doing 6 or 7 dances so it built as you got older.", "They do it for multiple reasons - some has to do with parents not being able to make it if it\u2019s just one night. A lot of it is that, as the kids get older, they are doing more, different numbers, and they are spread out over those days in a way that gives time to rest and change and whatnot. Little kids usually only have a single dance, maybe two, and so they get to come out and be adorable and the crowd always eats it up. They are in the big full studio productions (usually finales, the first dance after intermission, etc) as well, if they have some. The kids seem to enjoy it, they work hard to get to that point! \n\n\nNot a dancer here, but have worked backstage at recitals, so that\u2019s my take looking from the outside.", "The world", "Agree. Op learn from this. At the very least he can't really be depended on tbh he'll not see reason. To be annoyed that you got her shoes to help out when he didn't bring them or respond is telling as well. He thinks about himself first, not the two girls imo.", "I wondered right away what his reaction would be when this was brought up by OP.", "This is what\u2019s blowing my mind. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s about your kids and I will do a lot of things that I don\u2019t really enjoy for them. \n\nHow does someone choose to watch the exact same thing for the third day in a row when making that choice makes them a shitty parent? It\u2019s the strangest way I\u2019ve seen someone blow this whole parenting thing.", "So, in highschool, I was in a play. Students wrote them and acted all the parts. Everyone\u2019s parents went. Mine did not. The night of the performance, my mom pulled out at the last minute because she was tired, and my part wasn\u2019t large so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Everyone asked where my family was. I have never forgotten that, and that was many decades ago now. Never once did that to my kids. Not once.", "By playing her off his other daughter?? And failing to teach her impulse control and good character? He will make a spoiled, greedy, unsatisfiable and resentful adult who will not be able to have a happy life, in the unfortunate worst scenario. Spoiling is for rare occasion and grandparents, not real fathers who actually parent."]}
