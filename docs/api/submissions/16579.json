We have a daughter together Hannah 3 and my step daughter Ashley (his daughter from a precious relationship) is 10. \n\nHannah started dance classes this year. This is her first year performing at a recital and we were all very excited. We had tickets for all 3 shows (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and couldn\u2019t wait to watch her perform. \n\nAshley found out earlier this week she\u2019d be performing for her school chorus. The girl who originally was going to do it got sick. Ashley performance was Sunday at the same time as Hannah\u2019s dance recital that night. \n\nAshley told me how it would mean a lot to her if we went. So I worked it out with the dance school that Hannah would go the recital that night with my parents and Jack and I would go watch Ashley performance. (I would have pulled Hannah from dance but I was afraid she would want to sing during Ashley\u2019s performance and Ashley should be able to have her own moment.)\n\nWhen I told my husband he was so upset. He said he wanted to be there for all of Hannah\u2019s performances and we shouldn\u2019t be pawning her off on my parents. I said my parents were going to the show anyway and her bestfriends mom will help her with the costume (I helped her daughter the day prior). He said I was crazy if I thought sending our 3 year old without us was a good idea. She\u2019s stayed with her grandparents and gone to do things with them before. \n\nI told him he was being stupid and that Ashley needed her dad too. He refused to go and went with Hannah and told me to meet him at the dance recital. I went to Ashley\u2019s performance instead. While I was there I was saying hello to Ashley\u2019s mother and ended up finding out Jack never answered her about if he could bring her new black shoes. Ashley didn\u2019t realize until today the ones at her moms house were too small (doesn\u2019t wear them often) and I didn\u2019t want her to feel different from the other kids. Luckily I got there early and there\u2019s a shoe store down the street so I went to buy some and told her mom to keep them there so she has a pair at both houses now. \n\nWhen I went home my husband and I got into a huge argument. He said I let down Hannah and she was sad. I told him to keep in mind she\u2019s 3 she ALWAYS wants us and then forgets about it in 5 minutes when she sees something else she wants. I told him he needs to remember we have another child to also think about not just Hannah. I told him he was an awful father for not showing up for Ashley and for not even mentioning she needed shoes. Even if he wasn\u2019t going the least he could do was bring her the shoes. Him and I are still arguing and he\u2019s sleeping on the couch. He won\u2019t even talk to me and honestly I don\u2019t want to talk to him either. \n\nI feel like I might have crossed the line calling him a bad father. I was really angry. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: \n\nI just realized I didn\u2019t say why the shoes were mentioned. He asked me what that charge was for and when I told him he was mad I bought shoes for her mothers house. He said he pays enough in child support and buy her things for our house so it\u2019s ridiculous.", "created_utc": 1683428700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13aavhs/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_being_a_bad_father/", "score": 276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re completely right. Hannah will forget it in 5 minutes. Ashley, will definitely remember the solo she was so proud to get; and how it was not attended by her father. Hannah has a single stable home. Ashley goes between two. \n\nThis co-parenting needs improvement so it doesn\u2019t damage Ashley\u2019s mental health later on-she will blame herself/wonder why she\u2019s not enough for her dad. Even being the star of a performance is not enough for her dads affection/attention.

You obviously go to the one performance of a 10yr old vs 3/3 of a 3yr old who won't even remember it.

Hannah will not remember this but Ashley will. If your husband keeps this up and Ashley goes NC with him, I bet my ass he will play victim.", "NTA, he is a bad father if he cares more about not spending any more money than he has to on his daughter to spite his ex. His daughter needs shoes for each household no matter who buys them . She's the one benefitting from you getting her shoes, and he should care and appreciate that!", "NTA your husband is being a bad father and he needs to do better.", "NTA, it sounds like he is upset with having to pay child support to his ex.

There are kinder ways to explain his bad behavior without stooping to name calling.  It would have been much better to explain how he is being \"unfair\" or \"hurtful towards Ashley\".", "What a tough situation to be in as adults right? Maybe if he wanted to be there for Hannah he could have gone and one of the grandparents could have gone to Ashley's performance with you. Navigating what's right is so HARD when there's no clear right or wrong. For me, if he felt like he should have been there for one thing, he should given that opportunity without having to be told he needs to do this because of that. I do agree sometimes, as adult we should put our feelings aside but we shouldn't feel wrong for feeling a certain way about things. Who knows what he promised Hannah and felt like he needed to keep that because Ashley's performance was so last minute because someone got sick. It's a hard situation all around but conversations would help like asking if Ashley is ok with a grandparent/parent being there and also asking why Jack was taking it so hard. I don't think anyone was the A\\*\\*hole because parenting is hard and there's no clear cut way to do things. Take a breath, communicate, try to understand and just be there, for the kids and each other.", ">I feel like I might have crossed the line calling him a bad father.\n\nYou crossed the line quite a bit earlier than that. ESH.\n\nThis whole mess happened because you made a major unilateral decision for the two of you (how to split the events). For whatever reason, your husband saw the issue differently. That is mostly immaterial. It's unfortunate but such mistakes happen fairly often.\n\nYou each then disagreed with each other in a way that was brutal. \"Crazy.\" \"Stupid.\" \"Awful father.\" In no way were the words used by either of you justifiable. This is what made the conflict personal and bitter, and something that probably will have lasting effects for months if not years to come.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your husband is making WAY too big a deal out of this, and I'm sure Hannah was delighted to show off for her grandparents.\n\nNTA", "nta, thank you for standing up for Ashley <3", "NTA it\u2019s a lovely post to see how you went to battle for your step daughter I see too many that wouldn\u2019t. \n\nYour husband needs to stop, the shoe money well if he had replied about the shoes she needed you wouldn\u2019t have had to buy a new pair. But wow he begrudged his daughter a pair of shoes. \n\nHas he got form for this pushing his oldest to one side?", "NTA. My heart goes out to Ashley. You\u2019re a great stepmum for standing up for her.", "NTA - I am struggling to understand why it's a big deal to attend 3 dance shows for a three year old child.  I'm struggling to understand why they even have 3 of them for a child that young.\n\nWhy he would need to attend all three, to the exclusion of his other daughter makes no sense. How strange.", "Honestly, thank goodness Ashley has you in her corner.... You are NTA... Hubbie however - I can only shake my head in disgust!  \n\nIt's fabulous how you and Ashley\"s mum seem to be able to come together to support her", "3 year olds have 3 consecutive recital evenings seems outrageous to me.", "And guess what, when OP is his ex, this is exactly how he will treat Hannah.\n\n\u201cWhen someone shows you who they really are, believe them.\u201d", "3 dance performances for a THREE year old?  Calling  him a bad father does notale you TA..itakes you honest. Don't have anymore children with this man.", "Yea I see why firsts are important. If my three year old had a performance we ALL would be there the first time. My mother, my grandparents, my other child, my teenage brother and me. (Maybe my spouse my sister and my.dad too, but probably my dad would look after my sister) but the second time my dad would go with them and the third time one or two if us would go.", "And especially if an other child of the family had a big event.", "I was a dance kid from 3-18yrs old. My parents never missed a recital (or any of my sisters sports games) but they also absolutely never saw more than one recital a year. Even my senior year. (Recitals much like yours -- 3 performances of the same numbers in a weekend). Our studio rotated the littles for sanity and because they didn't make it to the evening performances, but once the kids are like 8 they're in every show.\n\nI was fine. \n\nI would not be fine if they had ignored either of us. \n\nWe were inseparable as kids despite a decent age gap, and I'm about to be the MoH in her wedding. I truly don't know if that would have been possible if our parents hadn't treated us equally. They love our differences and similarities. Your husband is an asshole & I'm glad you and baby momma seem to have a good relationship, and that you're showing up for the bigger kiddo.\n\nYou seem like a good person and a really good mom & bonus mom! \n\n\nPs the child support comment is huge ick and red flags galore. Gross dude.", "Partial comment stolen from u/Crazybutnotlazy1983\n\nu/prudedfsg is a bot", "It sounds like Ashley\u2019s mom didn\u2019t have the money to buy her new shoes (that being why she texted Ashley\u2019s dad). Him not even answering her about getting Ashley shoes is very selfish. I get that having kids and child support is expensive, but he could\u2019ve told Ashley\u2019s mom that money was tight. He\u2019s putting bitterness towards his ex before providing his daughter with what she needs.", "I just want to say thank you for being a global thinker when it comes to the children, regardless of how the family unit came to be.\n\nYou really do have to be more mature to be a great stepparent."]}
