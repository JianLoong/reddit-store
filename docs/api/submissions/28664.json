Yes, she works part time and has a nanny and is self-imposing a lot on herself. But the question is whether she's an a-hole for asking her husband to do something, *anything*. The issue is that the husband doesn't split *any* of the housework, childcare or mental labor that fall outside of daycare and the nanny. It's like he figures that since 90% of the work is paid for someone else to do, that OP can handle the remaining 10% just fine by herself. Except that's not how you parent or be a partner. Sounds like he thinks he can outsource all his responsibilities outside of his job. She asked for help and he argued with her instead of pitching in. Imagine having a spouse who contributes nothing to raising or caring for your kid.", "Need more explanation... how is it that you have day care, a nanny and still have so much to do. Ofcourse both parents should share responsibility but if so much outside help is making things easier then you need to change things.

Describe what you do, and what your nanny does.\n\nThis will help us to see what exactly needs to be done and what isn't getting done. You keep mentioning all this work that needs to be done on the house and from the looks of it,  it looks like it's consuming your life.... but yet... nothings getting done. So, I'm a bit confused.\n\nRegardless your husband should step up. His job is to be a present parent, not just simply be a person that pays the bills and goes to work.

I literally am not understanding. \n\nI work full time. My husband works full time. We have a 2 year old and a 4 year old. 4 year old goes to school 4 days a week, my daughter is home with me most days (my mom watches her when I work my 24 hour shifts in the hospital). My husband and I don't have a nanny, house cleaner, or daycare. Yet we both manage to spend time with the kids, keep the house clean, cook home made food, and still have time for ourselves. \n\nAre you guys just that had with time management? Does your daughter have to go to the park every day? Why not use 2-4 to do all the housework and prep dinner? Get your daughter involved. She can help swep, wipe the table, or help make dinner.

Cooking dinner and cleanup is pretty standard, same with childcare and it gets done no problem every day by single moms with multiple kids, but there\u2019s 2 parents and a nanny and the house is just a complete mess every day? If the house is this hugeeee just seclude yourselves to part of the house so there\u2019s less cleanup? If there\u2019s that many chores to be done either you need to be more efficient or your nanny needs to be fired and replaced with someone who helps lessen the load. Your husband still needs to get off his ass and help. 1 part time working parent, 1 paid nanny to do ??, and 1 lazy parent, maths not adding up.

And then 2-4 they are also watching baby after you are already home from work. Those two hours are your two hours to yourself.\n\nThen you have two hours alone with baby before your husband comes home.\n\nBesides cooking dinner and putting baby to sleep, I fail to see what needs to be done here?

You can pick her up at 4pm, which leaves you a couple of hours to clean the house (although you shouldn\u2019t have to do that every day, especially as there\u2019s no one home). Daycares have playgrounds and kids run around all day playing, so your daughter shouldn\u2019t need to go to the park after being there all day (and if she\u2019s with the nanny, the nanny should take her).

It is HARD to keep up with the responsibilities of running the house (even now that I stay at home full time!) \n\nSounds like the two of you should have a few in depth discussions about what each person\u2019s expectations are for the other.  Then divide duties afterward.  (Ex: my husband hated mowing the lawn, a traditionally masculine job in the house, so I started doing it.  I hate folding and putting away laundry, so now he does that. )  \n\nNext conversation would be each of you being frank about how often you actually \u201cclose\u201d a task.  My husband and I didn\u2019t realize how many things we left half finished when we were both working.  When we have more effort to actually finishing a job fully, life was a lot less messy (ex: wiping down the counters after cooking, putting things back where they \u201clive\u201d instead of setting them down, putting laundry straight into the basket when it comes off our body) we both have ADHD and it was/is hard to maintain a tidy household when we both thought it was the other\u2019s fault for the mess.  \n\nLast, have a talk about mental load.  I am the default parent for remembering anything and everything and it\u2019s really exhausting for me.  However, if I make weekly check-ins with my husband to pass off tasks and responsibilities, my load gets much lighter!

People discount the mental load, but being the one that\u2019s making all the decisions is a huge amount of stress.

A one time cleanup for one big house can span several days at times and be charged accordingly! I have relatives who have worked as housekeepers and nannies everyday, and there was constantly something new to do, organize, (plan and buy), clean and deep clean different sections - repeat. On top of that, the physical labor becomes exhausting day in and day out, and as a job, there is a standard to uphold for a client\u2019s home. Someone cleaning their own house has relaxed standards. It\u2019s so upsetting to see others undermine these professions like it\u2019s so \u201ceasy\u201d because they wiped one table in their small house. There\u2019s a reason why this is a profession.

They will do a quicker and better job than you or your nanny.\nGet a few of those meal planning kits weekly.\nGet a robot vacuum.\nDo online grocery shopping.\n\nHave a chat with your husband about division of chores but I suggest to not expect him to understand the idea of MENTAL load. Reddit is full of people who shit on stay at home moms or women who work part time. What the misogynists do not realize is whether the woman or the person taking on the traditional role of a female works or not they take on the lion share of activities to do with keeping a house a home.

Why would you even have to ask? That's his responsibility.\n\nBUT ALSO. Do you live in a super big house or something so your nanny who is also helping with housekeeping can't help tidy up in 5 hours?  I'm talking about a 5 bedroom/6 bathroom kind of place, in which case, lock the rooms you aren't using. Do you use every single pot and pan when you cook? If the answer is no, why are you struggling?\n\nYour husband has an obligation to take care of his daughter, which he should do. But on the cleaning aspect, if he's paying for someone to help around why is it so messy all the time? Learn to administrate your time. You don't have to deep clean every room every single day. Choose one day for deep cleaning kitchen, another for rooms, another for bathrooms. You can just put stuff in their place every day around the common areas and it really doesn't take much. Leave weekends for patio/yard work or something. Maybe do your laundry on Monday, your husband can do his on Tuesday and you can do the kid's on Wednesday. Unless you live in a 3 story house, in which case you shouldn't be using all of it for just 3 people, I don't see how you can't keep up with a home.\n\nIf the problem is the messy inhabitants of the house, take preventive measures, like teaching the toddler to not create a tornado or the husband to not be a pig and leave his work clothes or stuff all over the floor. But also tell him that it's his daughter too and he needs to help with bath or PJ time BECAUSE that's super important for bonding time. Taking care of her is part of raising, and he should be as involved as you are.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean, I realized my comment came off as strong, but really, reassess your cleaning habits and organization.

If I understand this correctly, you make her lunch take her to and from daycare play with her and put her to bed. That is like.0010% of what most mothers do. And I'm speaking of mothers who work eight, 10, 12 hours a day outside the home. You seriously come off as a selfish, spoiled little girl who never really wanted to be a mom in the first place.

Whether he deserves it or not is irrelevant at this point. He can\u2019t go back in time and help with chores already completed.

That is, clean less, which means you have to use your judgement to work out what parts of cleaning you can \"skip\" to get more downtime. When I was a couple of years into being a SAHM, and I was exhausted, I met another mom who was \"good at it.\" Her strategy was that when her kids were in preschool, that was her break. So, about 2.5 hours per day, in about the middle of the day. For you, this might be the hours of 2-4 pm when your nanny is there. Even if there is housework to be done, DO NOT DO IT. Sit yourself on the couch with a snack and a book and chill out. Take a nap if you feel like it. You have to conserve your resources because you'll be working until 9 pm, cleaning the kitchen etc.\n\nI'm also trying to figure out what your child does that requires cleaning your whole house everyday. I had a child like that too, but I understood that it was unusual. I would organise a drawer and he would come along and take everything out of it and throw it on the floor. That is why babyproofing was invented (my husband refused to babyproof the cupboards etc because he felt putting holes in the drawers would reduce the resale value of the house, so I had to follow my child around and make sure he didn't remove things from drawers. But if you can babyproof, it makes a big difference. Take some time to troubleshoot this problem and work out the cause and effect. It may take some experimenting with trying different things. We don't know what your house is like so that makes it hard to give you suggestions. \n\nAlso, if you have to go pick up your child from daycare in the middle of your workday, because your nanny can't drive, then you might consider switching to a different nanny.", "NTA for wanting help, but likely TA for wanting more and more and more when 1) you didn\u2019t have to have a child, 2) quit your job if you can afford it, 3) nanny, 4) daycare.

We\u2019ve been together for close to 25 years and I can honestly say we wouldn\u2019t have made it to 10 if we had focused on who earned the most and other garbage like that.

You both share a kid and a home. Your partner works full time, you work part time and take care of the house, in the evenings when you\u2019re home you should both be spending time with your kid.

Bedtime process: wash up(either just washing hands and face or full shower/bath), brush teeth, brush hair, lotion up, potty before bed/diaper up(depending on where you are in that set up), pajamas on (this may sometimes require a whole team of people depending on kid), sing and read (or read and sing), goodnight and kisses and hugs, lights out. Whoever did kitchen the other double checks lunch prep (just to be sure it is done and properly stored), and then you both taxkle throwing toys into their bins and then be lumps until your bedtime. The outlier situation is the pajamas, if the kitchen isn't done and the pajama wrangler needs help then the kitchen person stops and helps wrangle the wild child into pajamas. Then once routine is over continue the kitchen bit, preferably with the partner but that depends on the jabs the kid throws too. \n\n-2 year old girls are brutal.

He should be helping around the house.\n\nYou kinda suck for the amount of complaining you're doing when you do have significant help already. Many people handle all that you are without paid help and with more than one child, often without a partner. That doesn't change at all that he should be helping. It's also his house and his daughter... Even if he's paying for a nanny/housekeeper, he still needs to be spending time with his daughter.", "The thing is, husband doesn't do anything. Has he ever put the kid to bed or spend time with him? I feel like he is the type of parent who thinks that spending time with kid is babysitting.", "Why are you making lunch for a child that's coming home before noon?", "I think you're inefficient and not utilizing your resources effectively. And that's why your husband is annoyed because he is providing ample resources but you're not making the most of it. \n\nMake a better daily/weekly routine and schedule time for yourself. Keep a calendar and task lists/checklists  ( don't be afraid to revise and rewrite them to fine tune your needs)\n\nHave your husband help entertain (distract) your little one when he is home. It sounds like you're a little touched out. This is not a huge ask.\n\nNo you're NTA . I think you're stressed.  Maintaining a home and a young child is not easy but still you gotta learn to cope. Welcome to the dumpster fire reality of domestic bliss.", "Welcome to LIFE!! You have the nanny doing most of your housework and still complaining. You have 1 child. How hard can it be? Your husband is working 10 hours a day. If you have this nanny, why are you still running yourself ragged? Get it together.", "Nah there must be some ghost that keeps making a mess in the house after you clean or something \ud83d\ude02. Theres no way you cant \u201ckeep up\u201d with chores with a nanny and daycare while you work part time. Yall either live in a whole castle with a ghost that makes mess all the time or you\u2019re a failed adult.", " NTA asking for help but my wife looks after two kids under two all day cooks and cleans I come home we have dinner I then clean the entire kitchen do the dishes do the bed routine with the kids once they are asleep everything is tidy and then me and my wife relax and hang out so it shouldn\u2019t be that hard if your utilising a nanny and daycare", "Very odd post. Unless you live  at a farm and the house gets really dirty, I don\u2019t get why you would need to clean the hose so much, everyday. \n\nYou have your kid taken care by a nanny + daycare. Then you also take care of her\u2026 bring her to the park\u2026 seems to me the help you\u2019re getting is not effective if you still complain of having to do things for your daughter (which is normal as a parent, anyway). \n\nCould it be that the husband refuses to help because you\u2019re obsessed with cleaning the house and not prioritising your time to care for your kid?\n\nYour husband is TA for not helping with your kid. The fact that he pays for nanny+daycare doesn\u2019t mean he should be excluded from the responsibility of taking care of a child, even if he works longer hours than you. The split might not be an equitable 50/50, but it should never be 0 on his part. \n\nOP, you might need to reevaluate things and get the right help for all your needs (kid and house)", "YTA: I'm all about 100/100 parenting and splitting duties, but.....you have several breaks throughout the day. My spouse and I work from home 8-4 and we take care of our 6 month old all day and night. I take on the larger portion of that work, as well as meal planning and a lot of the cleaning. That's just being a parent. Your husband could help out by playing while you make supper, but a nanny would be life changing for most people. Also, no one needs hours of housework every day, even with a toddler. If that's the case, you barely need to clean up after yourself anyways.", "ESH\u2026\n\nThis seems like a lot of help and complaining for one kid and one house.\n\nHowever, your husband should be engaging with his child\u2026 otherwise why did he have kids?", "Your husband does the chores but you expect OPs not to do his when she asks?? She wouldn't be asking him to help if she didn't need help! So her working part time makes it ok to not get assistance when she needs it?? You breath in and out!!", "NTA.  It\u2019s his kid too.  You work and take care of the house and the kid.  He works.  Period.  Time for dad to be a dad.  Sheesh.", "You need to stop and get a grip of yourself. The nanny arrives at 9 and has no childcare duties until 11. I\u2019m guessing she undertakes household chores(?). 10 hours a week undertaking household chores is more than enough to clean an average home. Therefore you are a compulsive obsessive cleaner. That\u2019s on you - get therapy. You\u2019re the AH get a grip of yourself.", "This smells fake miles away", "I don't think OP is TA simply because husband/dad doesn't seem to want to spend any time with the child. Even if OP was a SAHM it would not be an AH move to request the husband take care of bath and bedtime duties some nights.", "It sounds like OP thinks the house needs to be deep-cleaned on a daily basis.", "I work 7:30-5:30 and I do housework and cook. If I had kids I\u2019d take care of them too. Sounds like she may be inefficient either way her time, but is still working a lot.\n\nI think both parents need to help with the kids, even if one parent has a full time job.\n\nMy sister is a stay at home mom and her husband works full time. She does as much work as he does. He knows he needs to help with parenting and chores too. They both work really hard.", "Husband needs aesbreak from what exactly if all he does is going to work and comes home and lies on the couch?? Gosh I'm glad I never got married and have no kids, the entitlement of men who are married and have children but think they are not expected to help around the house and help with the kids! Miss me with this marriage hoax thing!!", "Yeah im baffled too. Like theres no way she cant keep up with the chores with daycare and a nanny. There must be some ghost that keeps getting the house dirty or something because it makes no sense", "He works 10 hours a day while she works 5. If she wants everything to be 50/50 then best believe she better start working the same hours.", "Wtf are you on about. So we're gonna discount the fact that OP's husband works a job for fucking 10 hrs??? YTA", "Does it matter knowing he works 10 hrs?", "I agree Op needs to step it up and do more work. Its clear shes not doing enough. She works half the hours hubby does and has a nanny but still cant keep the house clean? Yeah right she needs to get her shit together.", "How is husband TA? He works from 8-6 with barely any time for himself while OP works for about 5 hours. Tf?? YTA OP, what are you doing with this much time!?", "Sure but best believe she better get a full time job then. Everything needs to be equal. She needs to step up if this is what she expects from him", "Stop working and footing the bill. Lets see how she feels about that.", "They have a nanny. All the things you said she does other than having the baby for 2 hours is done by the nanny. She aint working the same hours as the husband. If they didnt have a nanny then sure.", "You only work 5 hours, you have someone cleaning the house for you from 9-11 daily, and then watching your kid until 4 which means you get 2 non working hours while your child is watched daily. \n\nI'm all about parents splitting things equally, and your husband should certainly help, but he's working 10 hours to your 5 and is paying some to help you quite a bit. Stop being so lazy and entitled", "You work part time and have a nanny. I\u2019m so confused.", "I'm going to reply to this because the way you have set up your life is very similar to how I have. We have almost exactly that routine with some slight differences.\n\nMy wife makes the breakfast for our son in the morning and makes the coffee. Meanwhile, I get our son (who has started school now) ready, drop both of them at school and work and then head off to work myself. My mother helps out by picking my son up from school and the nanny takes over from there. Before he gets home, the nanny cleans the house and makes the lunch. My wife gets home around 2:30pm, unwinds a bit, eats lunch, and takes over the babysitting, allowing the nanny to make the dinner. My wife drops our son off at a class at 4 and picks him up after but she's busy checking on homework, packing his bag for school the next day, making sure the right books are sent along with stationary, extra stuff needed for classes get packed, etc. I get back home around 7:30pm ish and do the dishes after dinner (both wife and son are asleep by then). I pay the nanny, pay for my son's classes, and also pay for my wife's transport because I earn much more than she does.\n\nI still think I don't do a whole lot to help out at home, but I certainly do a lot more than your husband, who seems to only just go to work and do absolutely nothing at all at home. You're NTA and I think he needs to change the way he thinks about it (if he's capable of that). He needs to help out, even if it's something small like babysitting while you're making dinner and doing the dishes after.\n\nI also want to say that I think you're doing great. Taking your child to the playground despite your schedule is something we aren't doing on weekdays and use weekends for it. Your daughter is lucky to have a great Mom.", "Did you read the post and her comments? She has a fulltime nanny who cleans her house and helps with cooking and her kid is in daycare. She only works parttime. She\u2019s only responsible for their kid in the few hours between 4PM and the kid going to sleep. She described her day in detail in the comments. That\u2019s not exactly \u201cworking very hard\u201d. Her husband works 10 hours. Why is it on him to do housework, while there\u2019s so little to do and she only works 5? I do think he should spend time with the kid too in the very few hours he gets to spend with either one of his parents.", "Breath in breath out\u2026 OP and her husband have a fulltime nanny who cleans and helps cook. Their kid goes to daycare. They\u2019re only responsible for the kid a few hours a day. There are very very few remaining tasks based on OP\u2019s own account. Why should OP\u2019s husband rather than OP, who only works a few hours a day, take these up while he works more than twice as much as OP? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And I\u2019m a woman. I expect my husband to do half of the chores, which he does. But I wouldn\u2019t expect him to do so if he worked more than twice as much.", "I mean, back in the 70s, kids got bathed weekly, need it or not...", "So why is this the reply to my comment, I never said husband is TA.", "He\u2019s doing zero care for their child, so no, he needs to step up. He is equally that child\u2019s parent and doing none of the work, mental or otherwise. That\u2019s bullshit.", "This is what I'm wondering? OP could drop her off at 8am, then have whatever time she needs until the evening to do whatever she needs to do. Have the nanny pick up the child at 11, feed her lunch, entertain her, take her to the park; you know, do nanny things. Why not do it that way???", "OP has said the nanny doesn't have a drivers license.", "When I stayed home with my kids I cleaned the house every day. It took me two hours in the morning, I\u2019d read until lunchtime. Then I\u2019d fox my kids and I lunch then put them down for a nap and use that time to tidy up the lunch dishes. They\u2019d nap or have quiet time for at least an hour. They\u2019d get up and I\u2019d take us to a mommy and me type group or a walk or run errands for a couple of hours. We\u2019d get home and I\u2019d prep dinner for like an hour and get it started. Then I\u2019d read again while dinner simmered or was in the oven or whatever. Before my (now) ex husband came home I\u2019d do a quick clean of the house (put away a bulk of the toys, vacuum the common areas, sweep, take out garbage etc) that usually lasted about half an hour to an hour. Ex husband would come home, we\u2019d eat dinner, I\u2019d immediately put the dishes in the dishwasher. Bathtime, read a book to them, in bed by 730 or eight. Then I\u2019d have the rest of the night to pursue hobbies, spend time with the ex or when the kids got older I was a full time student and did my course work. Then in bed by 11 for me.\n\nPeople don\u2019t like to hear it but being a sahm is pretty easy as long as you are organized, don\u2019t have 500 kids and stick to a routine. My ex didn\u2019t do anything really around the house except let me sleep as long as I wanted on saturdays (he got sundays to sleep in) while he fed the kids and spent time with them.", "I really try my hardest to not compare people's lives to one another. But when I see posts like this, I think about my friend who is a single mother to two daughters (3 and 1) works full time, is full time college student, and now has to take on the responsibility of caring for her mother who was recently diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer and given six months to a year left to live, it's hard not to. I don't hear my friend complain one single bit. She doesn't even receive child support. \n\nOp, please count your blessings. There truly are people out there who have it much harder than you. I'm sure you feel dissatisfied with your relationship, but you're still considerably lucky to be in this position. Especially in today's economy. Being able to afford a nanny and only work part-time is a blessing.", "I just want to know why this house needs to be cleanrd *everyday* when there's only a few hours during the day anybody is there? Parents are at work, kid is at daycare, OP takes kid to the park 2 hours everyday.  Who's messing this house up?  What's the nanny doing all day, especially when the kid is at daycare and at the park?", "Yea, I saw that after I made the comment. It seems like having a nanny who could drive would be a requirement for things like pick-ups and drop offs at daycare or heaven forbid, an emergency.", "Same. Can't afford a maid or cleaning service once a month. Times are rough friends. Stay strong.\n\n\nOp. Ditch the nanny since nanny cares for kid and not house(generally). Get a maid service to help you twice a week or more depending on what you spend for nanny. Cleaning service would be worth it, since you are overwhelmed by it all.", "Ditto", "This is a gross take.

And they can rotate each night who does what. It\u2019s not that hard.", "You seem to be taking some strange grandstand like you're this God parent. Ignoring what you said about the other parent, if you act this way on the internet, you probably aren't as good a parent as you claim. I have to agree with the other person.
