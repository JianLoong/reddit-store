We had a baby girl two years ago, and the work around the house is huuuuge. We decided to hire a nanny when our little girl was 6 months old. The nanny comes at 9 a.m and leaves the house at 4 p.m. That means that from 4 p.m to 9 p.m, I have to work around the house. My husband works from 8 a.m to 6 p.m, and I work from 9 a.m to 2 p.m. Since I have a lot to do around the house, we decided to put our daughter in daycare but only from 8 to 11 a.m, and let the nanny work around the house. But again, all the responsibility falls on my back, because I am the one who has to take our daughter to daycare, I have to prepare her lunchbox at 7 in the morning, I have to go to work and then go back to daycare at 11... and in the afternoon I have to take her to the park or whatever so that she can play a little. Go back home and prepare dinner and put her into bed. Last week my husband and I got into this huuuuge fight. I asked him to take care of our daughter when he gets back home so I can finish working around the house. He got so pissed and said that he doesn't understand why I still need him since he's paying for the nanny AND daycare. I said that I work too and at the end of the day I am so tired I can barely have time to myself. When he comes home he lays on the couch while I cook, take care of our toddler... so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1696950427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174nin3/aita_for_asking_my_husband_for_help/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are ya'll slobs or something?", "INFO: As a mother of two kids myself, what is all this work around the house that the Nanny is doing it from 8-11 AM and you're doing it from 4-9 PM every day?\n\n**ETA:** NTA based on OP's replies. Yes, she works part time and has a nanny and is self-imposing a lot on herself. But the question is whether she's an a-hole for asking her husband to do something, *anything*. The issue is that the husband doesn't split *any* of the housework, childcare or mental labor that fall outside of daycare and the nanny. It's like he figures that since 90% of the work is paid for someone else to do, that OP can handle the remaining 10% just fine by herself. Except that's not how you parent or be a partner. Sounds like he thinks he can outsource all his responsibilities outside of his job. She asked for help and he argued with her instead of pitching in. Imagine having a spouse who contributes nothing to raising or caring for your kid.", "Need more explanation... how is it that you have day care, a nanny and still have so much to do. Ofcourse both parents should share responsibility but if so much outside help is making things easier then you need to change things.

I literally am not understanding. \n\nI work full time. My husband works full time. We have a 2 year old and a 4 year old. 4 year old goes to school 4 days a week, my daughter is home with me most days (my mom watches her when I work my 24 hour shifts in the hospital).

Cooking dinner and cleanup is pretty standard, same with childcare and it gets done no problem every day by single moms with multiple kids, but there\u2019s 2 parents and a nanny and the house is just a complete mess every day? If the house is this hugeeee just seclude yourselves to part of the house so there\u2019s less cleanup? If there\u2019s that many chores to be done either you need to be more efficient or your nanny needs to be fired and replaced with someone who helps lessen the load. Your husband still needs to get off his ass and help. 1 part time working parent, 1 paid nanny to do ??, and 1 lazy parent, maths not adding up.

You can pick her up at 4pm, which leaves you a couple of hours to clean the house (although you shouldn\u2019t have to do that every day, especially as there\u2019s no one home). Daycares have playgrounds and kids run around all day playing, so your daughter shouldn\u2019t need to go to the park after being there all day (and if she\u2019s with the nanny, the nanny should take her).

Then divide duties afterward.  (Ex: my husband hated mowing the lawn, a traditionally masculine job in the house, so I started doing it.  I hate folding and putting away laundry, so now he does that. )  \n\nNext conversation would be each of you being frank about how often you actually \u201cclose\u201d a task.  My husband and I didn\u2019t realize how many things we left half finished when we were both working.

I am the default parent for remembering anything and everything and it\u2019s really exhausting for me.

I have relatives who have worked as housekeepers and nannies everyday, and there was constantly something new to do, organize, (plan and buy), clean and deep clean different sections - repeat. On top of that, the physical labor becomes exhausting day in and day out, and as a job, there is a standard to uphold for a client\u2019s home. Someone cleaning their own house has relaxed standards. It\u2019s so upsetting to see others undermine these professions like it\u2019s so \u201ceasy\u201d because they wiped one table in their small house. There\u2019s a reason why this is a profession.

Do you live in a super big house or something so your nanny who is also helping with housekeeping can't help tidy up in 5 hours?

But on the cleaning aspect, if he's paying for someone to help around why is it so messy all the time? Learn to administrate your time. You don't have to deep clean every room every single day. Choose one day for deep cleaning kitchen, another for rooms, another for bathrooms. You can just put stuff in their place every day around the common areas and it really doesn't take much. Leave weekends for patio/yard work or something. Maybe do your laundry on Monday, your husband can do his on Tuesday and you can do the kid's on Wednesday. Unless you live in a 3 story house, in which case you shouldn't be using all of it for just 3 people, I don't see how you can't keep up with a home.\n\nIf the problem is the messy inhabitants of the house, take preventive measures, like teaching the toddler to not create a tornado or the husband to not be a pig and leave his work clothes or stuff all over the floor.

Taking care of her is part of raising, and he should be as involved as you are.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean, I realized my comment came off as strong, but really, reassess your cleaning habits and organization.

If I understand this correctly, you make her lunch take her to and from daycare play with her and put her to bed. That is like.0010% of what most mothers do. And I'm speaking of mothers who work eight, 10, 12 hours a day outside the home. You seriously come off as a selfish, spoiled little girl who never really wanted to be a mom in the first place.

Whether he deserves it or not is irrelevant at this point. He can\u2019t go back in time and help with chores already completed.

That is, clean less, which means you have to use your judgement to work out what parts of cleaning you can \"skip\" to get more downtime. When I was a couple of years into being a SAHM, and I was exhausted, I met another mom who was \"good at it.\" Her strategy was that when her kids were in preschool, that was her break. So, about 2.5 hours per day, in about the middle of the day. For you, this might be the hours of 2-4 pm when your nanny is there. Even if there is housework to be done, DO NOT DO IT. Sit yourself on the couch with a snack and a book and chill out. Take a nap if you feel like it. You have to conserve your resources because you'll be working until 9 pm, cleaning the kitchen etc.\n\nI'm also trying to figure out what your child does that requires cleaning your whole house everyday. I had a child like that too, but I understood that it was unusual. I would organise a drawer and he would come along and take everything out of it and throw it on the floor. That is why babyproofing was invented (my husband refused to babyproof the cupboards etc because he felt putting holes in the drawers would reduce the resale value of the house, so I had to follow my child around and make sure he didn't remove things from drawers. But if you can babyproof, it makes a big difference. Take some time to troubleshoot this problem and work out the cause and effect. It may take some experimenting with trying different things. We don't know what your house is like so that makes it hard to give you suggestions. \n\nAlso, if you have to go pick up your child from daycare in the middle of your workday, because your nanny can't drive, then you might consider switching to a different nanny.", "NTA for wanting help, but likely TA for wanting more and more and more when 1) you didn\u2019t have to have a child, 2) quit your job if you can afford it, 3) nanny, 4) daycare.

The only exception is when one of us has reason to be more worn down and then the other person shoulders some more. We\u2019ve been together for close to 25 years and I can honestly say we wouldn\u2019t have made it to 10 if we had focused on who earned the most and other garbage like that. We\u2019re not roommates and we\u2019re not in a business relationship. We\u2019re MARRIED.

The thing that people who just do the 9-5 and think that's the only thing they have to contribute to the family don't realize is, they clock out. They can just clock out. But, the person who has to manage the household? They never can. It's a 24hour job. It'd be nice for the husband to pitch in just a little on that end of things", "I couldn't afford a nanny OR daycare.", "That's not OCD. I really wish people would stop acting like ocd is neat freak disease. Plenty of us are slobs.", "The adult child she takes care of probably makes this challenging", "Anyhow, OP question was not if she/they were being efficient but if dhe was TA for wanting her from the father of their daughter! And, OP, NTA. I imagine you also contribute to the nanny salary and daycare expenses. And DD is your, uou and hubby DD, so HD should be doing his part ofparenting too", "Na I had 4 you just suck", "Sounds like the real problem is that she doesn't have a real partner. She has hired help but no husband who wants to be involved in the daughter's life or household activities, which is a WHOLE separate issue.", "OMG so true. I mean, learn to say no?", "Yeah, like what is the nanny doing from 9-11:30? What\u2019s happening between 2-4, when OP is done working and the nanny leaves? Is it just a crazy long commute? Why isn\u2019t the nanny doing pickup at 11 so you just stay at work? It sounds like there should be at least 2 hours (9-11) where housework could be done, unless the agreement is the many only cares for the child and doesn\u2019t do housework (I\u2019ve done this), and if that\u2019s the case, you shouldn\u2019t be paying for a nanny while the child is in daycare.", "It doesn't make any sense.", "I\u2019m trying to figure out how she has so much cleaning when the kid is out of the house for a few hours while the nanny cleans\u2026 and then the child is with the with the nanny till 4\u2026 and then to the playground. \n\nI don\u2019t think someone\u2019s T A for asking the other parent of the child for help but it sounds like he doesn\u2019t even want a kid. It also sounds like OP is more focused on cleaning her house than being a parent. This story is odd.", "I think it would be more efficient if you and your husband had a heart to heart and set expectations that make sense.", "Nanny cant drive thats why op leaves work. Im guessing either op is hybrid or work from home. My sister is hybrid she works a few hours at home then rest at office.\n\nIt sounds like husband doesn\u2019t believe he should do any housework or childcare for he pays daycares and nanny.", "The nanny doesn\u2019t drive. The husband should be helping with night time with his child. There two parents. He doesn\u2019t get an option to not be a dad. No wonder his child rather play near mom than dad. Its sad.", "I know what it\u2019s like to work fulltime, raise kids and look after your house. I just refuse to call a woman working parttime, only taking care of her own kid after 4 PM and having daily cleaning help a superwoman. No house is so big that just managing it can\u2019t be done in five hours a day. The few hours a day their kid isn\u2019t in the care of others, they should do it together though.", "Hear hear.", "I wonder if he thinks they have a magic coffee table \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02", "Nah, you\u2019re either a liar or you\u2019re the working parent who didn\u2019t have to do crap and left that burden on your partner so you think it\u2019s easy. Nobody with a brain and the experience would ever say what you did.", "I get that he needs to think about his family and help more, but working ten-hour days is exhausting.  I've done it.  \n\nHe does need to spend time with his daughter and his wife, but how does the house get so bad it takes hours daily to just clean.  \n\nI would have killed for an extra nanny and day care during times of raising my children.  I had neither.", "Op seems super high strung. I bet she's difficult to please.", "As I said it s a pretty big house and needs to be cleaned everyday. She also helps to cook lunch. She cant pick the kid up because she doesnt have a drivers license. Between 2 and 4 i take care of my kid even tho the nanny is at home with me.", "So let the child stay there until 2 (she has made the child lunch).  Fire the Nanny.  Hire a housekeeper and a personal chef at least part time.  Dads do need to spend time with their child, but often they are the breadwinner and don\u2019t always have that option.  In this case, it may not hurt to skip park time one night, have dinner early, and they can all watch a cartoon together and dance silly.  It\u2019s going to take some creative play to get dad to reengage.  He\u2019s in a rut as much as she is.", "And that is entirely your choice. Just please realize that you don't know every situation. Just your own experiences", "Na we both work you just suck. Not a good parent at all. A pushover you SUCK", "Agreed mum of 7 former shift worker where I worked 3-4 12 hours days a week with a big house still not seeing where she spends all her time but I remember coming home shattered after the long days eat sleep work repeat minimal child interaction on back to back long days.  \nMaybe she could work more hours so he could workless and interact with daughter.", "There's no excuse for being an absent father.", "No house needs to be cleaned every day. Why is she in daycare? And a nanny? Why doesn't nanny leave at 2? Or child stay in daycare until 2?", "What does the nanny do between 2-4 then? I\u2019d say from your comments and the post, the main issue isn\u2019t that there\u2019s too much too do, it\u2019s that your other is checking out and not participating in family life. For the first problem, that there\u2019s too much to do, either let the nanny care for your child during their hours and do the work you want done, or get the nanny to do the work you want done. Or a maid instead of a nanny for part of the day since you are only using the baby for childcare been 11:30-2. Then you will have someone cleaning from 9-11 and 2-4 every day; 4 hours for daily upkeep should be plenty of time even for a large house. \n\nThe separate issue may be helped by framing it with your spouse as times that your child needs to be with the other parent, as well as modeling that domestic responsibilities are not just the realm of female parents, rather than you \u201cneeding help\u201d from your partner. You both share a kid and a home. Your partner works full time, you work part time and take care of the house, in the evenings when you\u2019re home you should both be spending time with your kid. Maybe you could start doing something for yourself one evening a week, like a group hobby or class, so your spouse has to do the bedtime routine.", "Why are you paying someone to watch your kid and then you\u2019re still watching them? None of this makes sense. Either you or the nanny are inefficiently using your time. Either way, YTA for asking your husband to help, I\u2019d be questioning this too if I was working 10 hour days, paying for daycare, and paying for a nanny, and you\u2019re STILL asking for help.", "Why do you have a nanny who isn\u2019t able to drive? That feels like an important skill for one to be able to have in an emergency. Also, why can\u2019t she mealprep dinner for you from 2-4 since she\u2019s apparently also your maid so that you\u2019re not cooking after work?", "Sounds like 2-4 needs to be you time. Also it is ok for your daughter to have free play at that age while being supervised aka she is playing in the living room while you are there but not actively playing with her. What I think you really want is a husband who is actively parenting and not just providing. Honestly you guys will need couples counseling bc your needs aren\u2019t being met. \nBut you need to let things go- the whole house doesn\u2019t need to be cleaned everyday let your husband put up his own clean clothes, let the dishes soak over night, no need to clean the bathrooms every day, learn how to make crockpot meals, make bigger batches of meals and start having leftovers more often and freeze the rest. If he complains about the new normal then let him take over something else and make him do it for example he doesn\u2019t want any leftover then he can meal prep meals for dinners on the weekend, he doesn\u2019t like putting up his clothes then he gets to bath and put the kid down 2 nights a week without you. \n\nAlso on another note, you remind me of one of my closest friends who had major anxiety about being a working mother and thought every second of her child\u2019s day needs to meaningful- it took her a long time to give herself grace and not try to be the perfect pintrest/tik tok mom. Give yourself that Grace too", "No house needs to be cleaned every single day!!!!!!", "How big is your house? And even then, if it\u2019s that big, how is it getting so messy so fast that ALL of it needs constant cleaning? This makes no sense.", "The work you refer to \n\nIs this employment? Or household labor?", "The thing is he has the option. He choosing not to. He leaving op with all the mental load. That is exhausting and everything that needs to get done outside of the nanny. I bet op is the one who does all the communication to the nanny. \n\nBeing a breadwinner isnt an excuse to not do anything at home.", "OP came here for our opinion. She gave us a description of her day. It sounds very very easy to me based on her own account. It sounds unreasonable to ask for even more help if you have so few responsibilities and so much help. Of course I answer this question based on what I deem normal based on my experience, my friends and family\u2019s experience and what I see in the rest of society. Other people have other experiences. People with fulltime nannies and no fulltime job, who still put their kids in daycare, have different expectations than people not living in that kind of luxury. But in my book asking for even more help when you have so little on your plate makes you in the wrong.", "Lol if you\u2019re twelve just say that, no need to try and act like an adult.", "I\u2019d beg to differ. Sweeping, wiping, organizing, and even maybe detailing the bathrooms quick can be a daily thing if multiple people live in a house", "I think the husband should be spending time with his kids after work, but other than that this set up is so fucking nonsensical that I don't know where he could jump in to do housework", "It\u2019s definitely not an excuse, I agree with this.  However the mental load is self imposed here.  Her current schedule, her standard of clean, her standard of how much time her child needs at the park, even the time she chooses to wake up is all her choice.  She is in a rut and she has the power to work on herself and her schedule first.  When she frees up her time then she will be able to tackle his rut.   Placing the blame at his feet that she\u2019s worn out and tired is not going to solve the root of the issue.", "You don't know the square footage of the house, you don't know the extent of the mess, you don't know how active her child is, you don't know how much of a slob her husband is, you Don't know how mentally challenging her work is, you don't actually know how full or even all of what is on her plate. Again.  \n\n\nAnd yes, just like you said, she's coming here for our opinions, of which I am giving her. And if you do accept that other people have other experiences. Then maybe just accept that her situation may be different then one you've experienced, so it may not be unreasonable for her to ask for help from the guy who it sounds like just pays the bills and nothing else for the family", "Believe what you will but you not a good parent if that\u2019s how you roll", "Even so, with two adults who can clean up after themselves and a toddler who is unlikely to be able to reach many surfaces it shouldn't be as taxing as the OP makes out.", "She shouldn\u2019t have to fix her schedule for him to act like a dad. That needs to be first. Once he does then her schedule will be realistic. To fix her schedule then do it again when he steps up is pointless", "You\u2019re entitled to another opinion. You\u2019re allowed to think she\u2019s superwoman. I\u2019m also allowed to think she is far from. \n\nI just think that by any measure, even in a big house and an active kid, she has very few responsibilities and a lot of help, in comparison to the grand majority of people. There\u2019s no evidence that her house has 23 rooms, her kid has disorders or is overly active nor that she works parttime at NASA. Based on her own account she does much less than the average parent and probably less than her own husband. I know other people have different experiences but all I can do is judge based on the information in her post. Her own account tells me she has very few responsibilities and it\u2019s unreasonable to ask for even more help (beyond her husband taking care of their child too in the very very few hours other people aren\u2019t taking care of their kid or they are sleeping).", "Lol you\u2019re not a parent at all but okay I\u2019ll totally listen to someone who acts with the maturity of a preteen online", "It\u2019s pretty evident from this post that OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t lift a finger", "If the husband is only at work or laying on the couch, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s doing much cleaning, not even after himself.", "And it's still my opinion that regardless the amount of help she has or the size of load, the Husband and Father should still pitch in a little bit to hang out with their kid and take care of them...that kid that he helped make.", "They're talking about OP and the nanny", "Even then, with a nanny cleaning and the wife cleaning, I am not buying into this one. \n\nThere are only 3 people living there. Only 2 even need the bathroom, so it cant be that bad, every day.", "If anything ESH in this situation. Sure she seems a bit entitled (but again, we don't know the full ins and outs), but from the comments it seems like her Husband thinks that, after his financial obligation is taken care of (paying for nanny and majority bills I'm guessing), that is where his parental obligation and his obligation to actually help his partner, ends. Both partners need to sit down and figure out how to actually take care of things Together"]}
