I didn't explain the reasoning to her as I wasn't looking to argue with her or hear whatever defenses she had for how she ended things prior. I asked her to stop trying to contact me politely and that was that.\n\nFast forward to a couple of months ago to a couple of days ago. I'm at home and she calls me twice. I just let it ring and didn\u2019t worry about it. But then she texts me, \"I'm coming to your house right now with be ready to go\". I text back saying don't and that I'm not going anywhere. She then calls me and she's piss drunk telling me that if I don't come out she's coming up to my door. Mind you I live with my parents and I don't need my mom answering the door to a drunk girl that I know. So sure enough they get to my house so begrudgingly I get in the car. They tell me we're going to my friends house as our friend was having most of our group over.

He then tells me that she had told him that we had made up and we're talking again. I told him that it was bullshit from her but I'd just keep the peace for the night.\nHe was super apologetic and I don't blame him for any of this, he got lied to as well.\n\nSo shit hits the fan when she comes back and some time passes when then one of our other friends rips the band aid off and asks if we're back together.

She told me to calm down I told her to fuck off and I explained situation to everyone. I then asked her to explain why we separated the first time and she wouldn't answer because at this point she's crying and I tell everyone she didn't have to guts to just end things.

Yes, it meets the technical definition of sexual assault, but c'mon... There are ways to express that you're angry or upset and to communicate to the other person that you don't want to be touched again without screaming as loud as you can possibly scream. Part of being an adult is learning to express your anger in a healthy way, even when that anger is justified.", "Woman here, and while I agree with you that if the roles were reversed OP would be applauded on Reddit, good chance she\u2019d still get called crazy by people who witnessed screaming like this. Shouldn\u2019t be that way, but it frequently is.", "That I understand because no one knows the context. And unfortunately women are encouraged to shout fire rather then help shows what kind of society we live in. But in this case on AITA we are given context. We know what led up to it.

But this was about his ex and I feel he's done nothing wrong", "NTA, but you do lack some basic common sense.\n\nYou should NEVER have gotten in the car.  You should have told her that if she came to the door, you would call the police and have her arrested for trespassing.  Then, when they showed up, you should have told your friend that you did not want to go, and that if he didn't take her away RIGHT THEN you were going to call the police (on her, not him).\n\nThen do it.\n\nCooperating and getting in a car with someone who is obviously unstable (whether from substances or from a mental condition) rarely ends well and only encourages them.

I don't even see the YTA supposed comments that are being bitched about.

She clearly wasn\u2019t listening to nice/polite, you made sure she heard you. It\u2019s her own fault if she\u2019s embarrassed.

She lied to you, lied to your friends, forced herself on you in front of all your friends.

You weren't getting through any other way, and everyone there was being fed lies.", "This. She harassed you and coerced you. She is awful. Her tears don\u2019t mean anything, she is in the wrong and you don\u2019t deserve to have her continuing this BS. Tell her if she doesn\u2019t stop you\u2019ll file a restraining order.

That said, you had every right to be angry and to tell her off in front of everyone.", "Reverse the genders and op is in actual danger.", "He had every right to react angrily and make a scene. He had every right to tell all of his friends what was happening and express vocally that he was not okay with her touching him. He had every right to raise his voice and even yell to show how upset he was. But that's different than screaming at the top of your lungs. I seem to be the only person who cares about that distinction, but it's the hill I've chosen to die on.", "Are they on your side though? Just need to figure out if you need new friends lmao", "It sounded to me like the friends just had no idea.\nIf they don't see this and have an ah-ha moment, then yes, OP, consider.hard if they're friends you need.", "Of all things that happened the screaming is the biggest problem?", "Who's to say he isn't.", "That happens when someone kisses you that you don't want to touch you.", "She wasn't listening to reason.

OP was not out cornered on the street.  So no, I'm not saying anything at all about a woman being assaulted on the street by a stranger.  I'm talking about a situation where a person, at home, behind a locked door, chooses to put on their shoes and coat, unlock the door, walk out the door, get into a car, and go with somebody they don't want to go with, all to avoid the terrible inconvenience of having to let Mom know that somebody else is being a terrible person.\n\nWhy are you bringing completely unrelated issues into this discussion?", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s saying that.

I'm not excusing what the woman did at all.\n\n>If he had rejected her privately\n\nI never said he should have rejected her privately. That clearly hadn't worked previously. I think he was right to confront her in front of everyone and tell them the truth, but he could have done that without literally screaming. Do you not understand the difference between raising your voice or even yelling a bit and screaming at the top of your lungs?"]}
