We went a few months without seeing or talking to each other, we didn\u2019t talk for months after this, but then she tried to text and FaceTime me for a few days with no answer from me. She persisted until I finally texted her back saying I wasn't interested anymore. I didn't explain the reasoning to her as I wasn't looking to argue with her or hear whatever defenses she had for how she ended things prior. I asked her to stop trying to contact me politely and that was that.\n\nFast forward to a couple of months ago to a couple of days ago. I'm at home and she calls me twice. I just let it ring and didn\u2019t worry about it. But then she texts me, \"I'm coming to your house right now with be ready to go\". I text back saying don't and that I'm not going anywhere. She then calls me and she's piss drunk telling me that if I don't come out she's coming up to my door. Mind you I live with my parents and I don't need my mom answering the door to a drunk girl that I know. So sure enough they get to my house so begrudgingly I get in the car. They tell me we're going to my friends house as our friend was having most of our group over. She was trying to talk to me in the car and I'm just sitting in silence and she was all giggly that I was there at all.\n\nSo we get to the house and everyone can just tell l'm pissed and a few asked me what's wrong and I just said don't worry about. My ex then goes to the bathroom. I then pull my friend that drove us aside privately and ask why the hell he would pick me up with her. He then tells me that she had told him that we had made up and we're talking again. I told him that it was bullshit from her but I'd just keep the peace for the night.\nHe was super apologetic and I don't blame him for any of this, he got lied to as well.\n\nSo shit hits the fan when she comes back and some time passes when then one of our other friends rips the band aid off and asks if we're back together. To which she then tells the whole room \"we'll see! l'm just happy he asked me if I wanted to come tonight\" and hugs me and kisses me on the cheek.\n\nTo which I then lose my mind. I started out by just yelling BULLSHIT. I then ripped her about lying to the friend that picked me up with her. I then start yelling at her to tell everyone the real story as to how I ended up there. She told me to calm down I told her to fuck off and I explained situation to everyone. I then asked her to explain why we separated the first time and she wouldn't answer because at this point she's crying and I tell everyone she didn't have to guts to just end things. Then yelled at her that I told her to leave me alone months ago and i screamed at her this whole stunt she pulled to get me there was pathetic and she went upstairs hysterical and I left.

I think you handled everything quite correctly during this whole long ordeal. She (drunk or not) sounds a bit unstable and immature. She's lonely and realizing perhaps that you were the type of guy who would be good for her. But she blew that up long ago. Yeah, sorry, but sometimes things are one and done; you don't get to start back up just because you want to. She's learning that lesson the hard way. And it sounds like she deserves it. *Bye Felicia.*", "OP, NTA. Well, I would say this might be one of those situations where you were probably a bit of an asshole, but you were also justified. You had been pushed to your breaking point. This person doesn't sound stable; they also sound very very manipulative and I'm sorry they treated you with such disregard. Maybe she'll learn that stunts like this won't get her what she wants, but I'm not so sure.\n\nIt might be worth considering why you were screaming at the top of your lungs.

Don't get me wrong OP, I was fully with you ready to go nta like everyone else here until the screaming and the yelling started.
