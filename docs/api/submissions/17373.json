I asked her to stop trying to contact me politely and that was that.\n\nFast forward to a couple of months ago to a couple of days ago. I'm at home and she calls me twice. I just let it ring and didn\u2019t worry about it. But then she texts me, \"I'm coming to your house right now with be ready to go\". I text back saying don't and that I'm not going anywhere. She then calls me and she's piss drunk telling me that if I don't come out she's coming up to my door. Mind you I live with my parents and I don't need my mom answering the door to a drunk girl that I know. So sure enough they get to my house so begrudgingly I get in the car.

He then tells me that she had told him that we had made up and we're talking again. I told him that it was bullshit from her but I'd just keep the peace for the night.\nHe was super apologetic and I don't blame him for any of this, he got lied to as well.\n\nSo shit hits the fan when she comes back and some time passes when then one of our other friends rips the band aid off and asks if we're back together.

She told me to calm down I told her to fuck off and I explained situation to everyone. I then asked her to explain why we separated the first time and she wouldn't answer because at this point she's crying and I tell everyone she didn't have to guts to just end things.
