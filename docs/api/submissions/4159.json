I (14M) have a younger brother Cane (11M), this will be important for later, today my mom got some of my cousins together to take some Christmas family photos. This would\u2019ve been fine, but. My cousin Em (18F) came with her brother Jim (20M) and her boyfriend Rick (19M) my problem is Rick \n\nBit of backstory. Rick was my neighbor 2 years ago when he met my cousin Em. She immediately starting hanging out with him, me and Em were very close, we went everywhere with each other and she was my best friend. At first I was very nice to Rick, I love talking to people and I\u2019m a very social person. Rick immediately starting being mean to me, making fun of me, excluding me, etc. At first I saw it as lighthearted bullying, but later on it became repetitive, and annoying. Over the years he\u2019s gotten worse as I slowly started to be myself more, making fun of my hair, my interests, my clothing, and anything he could poke at. \n\nOn to what happened today. My cousin Em loves to take photos, so she came over with her camera and we started taking photos. I took a photo with my family and went to my room for awhile because I am homeschooled and I have lots of work to do. Later I came from my room for dinner and Em asked if I would like to take some funny pictures with her, I said yes. She asked Rick if he would join us but he immediately shut it down. We went on to take them by ourselves until Jim was done eating. It was fun and I was enjoying myself until Rick joined us. For the photo Em was sitting on the floor, Jim behind her, me behind Jim, and Rick behind me. Em had asked my younger brother Cane to take the photos. Cane was sitting in a chair across the room, Cane is a chubby kid, but he\u2019s 11, so who cares. As I\u2019m taking the photos I hear R behind me.\n\n\u201cLook at Cane\u2019s gut.\u201d Now, he whispered his so I immediately went into big brother mode. \u201cShut the fuck up Rick.\u201d Rick laughed and everyone just kinda froze, but we continued. It was fine until Rick snickered and once again whispered. \u201cOkay homer.\u201d When Cane asked someone to move more into frame. This where I could be the asshole.\n\n\u201cRick shut the fuck up! He\u2019s 11. Leave him alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a big deal when you are making fun of an 11 year olds weight and calling him homer!\u201d\n\n\u201cCane thinks it\u2019s funny!\u201d (Cane did not think it was funny.)\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m sick of you, you\u2019re barely literate and an absolute moronic asshole. I wish you would stop talking!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just mad everyone calls you weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! You\u2019re an asshole and I\u2019m sick of you!\u201d\n\nI then got up and yelled some more as I walked away. My cousin Em was silent and the rest of my family was stunned. Rick was out of line but maybe I shouldn\u2019t have yelled in front of everyone. Because no one but me heard him.
