She should have been understanding instead of shaming your financial situation.", "Who the hell charges their wedding guests for food???", "Everyone gets dinner for free at a wedding, and in exchange they bring a gift.\n\nNo free dinner = no gift, and many couples kindly ask their friends to pay for dinner in lieu of a gift so that they can afford to share their special day with all their friends.\n\nNTA that bride was a liar.", "Yeah, you're the asshole. It is exceptionally easy to slip out of a wedding for even half-hour periods and not be noticed. Many slip out for cigarettes etc. Even a restroom break can take ten minutes. You said it was 5 minutes away.

Sounds like she's justifying lying to your face. Who charges people to eat at their wedding??\n\nThough I feel like this could have been avoided by simply not informing the bride, you two don't seem especially close (\"colleague\") so I doubt she would have noticed your absence.", "NTA\nPeople are so uptight about weddings. I'm not saying what you did was tasteful, but it's understandable and the bride gave you incorrect information. Ya gotta eat.", "NTA, never heard of an wedding where you have to pay for the food! Usually if you have to pay, it is for the extra alcohol, but not for the food. That is such an unusual way to handle things that she definitely should have told you it beforehand, and if I had to guess, you weren't the only one surprised.", "NTA. No-one expects to pay for a meal at a wedding.", "NTA. Never before heard of a wedding where you have to pay for the food. If there's a food fee, she should have told you or it should have been clarified in the invitation. \n\nI do think that you handle it a bit clumsily - you should have just gone to McDonald's in secret and came back later.

This is the first I\u2019ve heard about something like this, but it doesn\u2019t surprise me.

I've never been to a wedding where the guests have been expected to pay for their meals.", "NTA wtf. Where are you from? Because every wedding I've been to the couple pays for the food (or whoever's paying for the wedding). This should've been disclosed in the invitation AT LEAST.\n\nYou probably could've snuck out and eaten and returned, but that's just me being nitpicky. Bride and groom are TA.

Never heard of this...\n\nHard to believe this story is real, sounds like some 12 year old wrote it...", "NTA, what is with this new trend of having wedding guests pay for their meal? Pay for drinks, fine, pay for the photo booth, fine, but the meal? This is just whoever planned the wedding being cheap, I would have no problem losing a friend over something that stupid.

Especially since you usually already pay for clothes, transportation and a gift. But as someone else commented I wouldn\u2019t have asked. I\u2019d have gone and eaten and come back. She probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed.", "Really curious where you live that 'attendance fees' at weddings are a possibility, and 'michelin-star' restaurants don't have credit card facillities. \n\nAnd also why you had to specify to her that you were getting McDonald's instead of just slipping out?", "I'm gunna say NTA, because in this case \"asshole\" implies some intent. At 25, though, you should know that **1)** a wedding can be a *super* stressful time for the bride (and groom and family) and that **2)** it's a day where the bride is allowed to put herself (and her groom) at the center of things, and **3)** weddings are financed in part by the guests.  \n\n\nBecause of #1 and #2, consider to cut her some slack in your heart, for it was likely the pressure of the day talking.  \nOh, and she didn't *lie* to you, she just assumed that you knew the deal. (That being said, I've never been to a wedding that had a menu with prices, so that seems a bit odd; normally you're given a few selections and you make your choice known when you RSVP.)", "NTA, attendance fee, at a wedding? What plane is she from? People already \"pay\" but bringing gifts and she is proud she didn't put an entrance fee as well? The food is payed per order? Some crazy wedding lol\n\nAnyway, the only thing you did wrong is skipping a meal prior. It could happen that you didn't like anything on the table so you'd still be hungry. There's no need to eat extra prior (unless you are a very picky eater), but skipping a meal to be extra hungry... IS CHEAP for my taste. As for the rest, leaving quietly would be better than asking for a permission, honestly \n\nAll in all, you ate NTA but you lack some tact.", "YTA for having a go at the bride on her wedding day.  You could have left slyly and then explained after the fact.\n\nIn terms of expecting to pay, I'm very on the fence.  I've never been to a wedding where you pay for the meal, but I've only been to small weddings (though I have always had to buy my own drinks so carried cash or card for the event).  So I don't think you're awful for not expecting the cost, but you could've handled it a lot better", "NTA - some people are so tacky it literally oozes out of everything they do.", "NTA. Cash bars are tacky enough. I\u2019ve literally never heard of attendance fees or charging for the meal. Who does that?", "INFO: Where do you live that it's acceptable for people to charge their GUESTS money for the food at their wedding? \n\nNTA.", "Their solution to feeding their guests was *ridiculous*, they should not be profiting off the people they've asked to join them to celebrate their marriage! I hope you grabbed your gift back on the way out. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI've literally never heard of a wedding where you have to pay for your meal. I'm genuinely baffled she expected you to pay that, especially after saying there wouldn't be a cost.\n\nI mean you definitely could have just slipped out quietly and not said anything. But it sounds like she's the one that escalated the situation afterwards as well.", "NTA.\n\nWhilst paying for you meal instead of a gift is becoming more common guests are notified on the invites so they can just not attend if they dont wanna pay $50.", "NTA - But I think you handled it wrong. You shouldn't have asked her if it was okay to leave and get McDonald's. You should have done it and come back. The bride/your colleague does sound like a bit of a jerk and she shouldn't have humiliated you that way.\n\nI've never been to a wedding where I had to pay for my own food, and I've been to some cheap ass weddings and some expensive ass weddings. Next time, you'll know to be prepared. Also did you buy her a gift? Because if you didn't and showed up to get a free meal, then you're a bit of an asshole.", "NTA. Who invites people to pay for their own meal anyway? I know the principle of potluck, but this was no potluck. People should not invite other people if they are not paying for the food.", "I have never heard of a wedding having a menu where a guest had to pay for the dinner. The bride & groom are assholes for not having that put on the invitations for everyone to know ahead of time.", "NTA, I have never heard of guests paying for the food at a wedding before. At least it doesn't happen where I am from. Weddings are stressful but still your colleague shouldn't have been so harsh about it. No one walks into a wedding expecting to pay for the food. You could have just excused yourself without explaining the reason but then again the entire situation is weird to me.", "Who pays for food at a wedding? NTA. \n\nIt's nearly always catered, either sit down meal, buffet, pot-luck - every type of wedding I've been to had never requested payment for food. Drinks, yes, obviously but not food. \n\nIf I were you, I'd have just ducked out quietly and gone for food and come back. If it was queried then make up an excuse about needing something from your hotel.", "NTA. She lied and then got pissy at a problem her deceitful nature caused. Good luck to the husband, he'll need it.", "NTA\n\nCharging people to eat at a wedding is just cheap and tacky. As the bride and groom, you are the hosts of a celebration and you damn well cater for your guests. If you can\u2019t afford a Michelin starred 5 course meal, you do a cheaper option. You do not put that onus on your guests. They have stumped up to pay for nice clothes, transport, possibly a hotel room, and a gift. They should not be expected to pay the costs of your wedding too.", "NTA\n\n>You literally assumed that you'd get a free five-course dinner.\n\nUm, yeah, you did. Wedding guests aren't typically asked to pay for their dinner. And you'd already asked about costs and been told there weren't any.\n\n>there is no attendance fee!\n\nWTF is an attendance fee? Was she going to have a bouncer at the door collecting a cover charge? \n\nLook, you said this woman is your coworker, which could complicate things. But holy hell, is she entitled. You are not the AH here, she is.", "NTA. Why would you have to pay for a meal at a wedding? That\u2019s insane. Especially without a warning. \n\nIf they can\u2019t afford to throw a party this expensive they should have done it differently. I went to an amazing wedding where the bride, a few of her other friends and I spent the whole day cooking nice food for everyone. It\u2019s one of my favorite memories.", "NTA. I have never heard of a wedding where the guests are expected to pay for dinner. Especially without any notice.\n\nThe Bride's response is BS too. \"Attendance Fees\" are not a thing at weddings. You asked and she said there was no cost. The misunderstanding is on her.", "Nta I've never known weddings to charge for food or attendance", "NTA. I have NEVER heard of guests being expected to pay for food at a wedding. Ever. She publicly humiliated herself.", "Info: why didn\u2019t you just slip out and go get your food instead of making it a point to tell her?", "ESH\n\nThe right thing to do was to excuse yourself (and keep the reason to yourself). She lied to you which is really messed up. But there was no reason for you to actually tell her you were going to McDonald's.", "NTA, it does not make sense to have you pay for a meal at another persons wedding, and you brought a gift? I think the bride and groom are the once being cheap. \n\nBut as others also have stated, I would also just have slipped out without anyone noticing and slipped back in again.", "NTA! I have been to over 30 weddings in 6 countries, and I have NEVER paid for the meal. That is always the most expensive part of the wedding, no matter the budget. There is nothing wrong with being a young person who has to preplan big expenses to save up for them or lives within a budget, and no one should make you feel bad about that. It is great that you have a responsible attitude about money.\n\nIt's the stingiest tackiest thing I have heard of for someone to do with zero warning. And it isn't about income, it is about the bride wanting a fancier wedding than she could afford, and forcing her guests to pay for it with no notice. I've been to every kind of wedding from a backyard wedding to a destination wedding on a Greek island, and I have never paid for the food. Occasionally, you see a cash bar after the first few drinks, but even that gets most people's eyes rolling.\n\nBtw, I loved that you went to Mcdonald's. It made me laugh.", "I\u2019m half French half Chinese living in the US. And I\u2019ve been to weddings in all three cultures as well as several others. \n\nI have never, ever once heard of a wedding that charges guests for dinner. Maybe a cash bar at the most, but never ever once has the wedded couple presented me with a price list to order from for the wedding reception dinner. And never in any culture I have experienced would that be acceptable. \n\nIf I even joked about doing this I would be laughed out of the room. \n\nI think you desperately need some new friends?", "NTA. Id leave a wedding that expected me to pay for the meal too. Honestly you were way more polite about it than I would have been too. Expecting guests to pay for their own food at a wedding is cheap and shitty. If you can't afford to pay for the food at your wedding then you need to reconsider your entire wedding budget.", "Lord, NO, definitely NTA.\n\nThe bride should have told you that the meals would cost money (and how much at that) I understand wanting to have top-notch food, but expecting people to pay hundreds of dollars to eat at a wedding they'd been invited to? Hell no.\n\nAt the very least, it should have been common knowledge that the food wouldn't be free and the prices should have been made public for the guests, imo. (Not sure how common this practive is in other countries though, but where I live this is not normal at all, so maybe that colors my perception. Still, nta.)", "absolutely NTA. Is this an American thing? since when you have to pay for a wedding dinner???\n\n\nand tbh, just in case: your friends and boyfriend are also assholes", "NTA. Who the hell expects guests to pay for their food at the wedding?", "NTA. That's not a wedding, that's a party at a restaurant. And her excuse that there was no \"attendance fee\" is ridiculous because *that's not a thing either*. She wanted a fancy wedding that she couldn't afford, so instead of doing the barely veiled \"give me money gifts\" routine, she just literally charged her guests for food.\n\nI'm guessing the reason you were invited was to fill out numbers when her other guests refused to pay to attend *her* wedding.\n\nYou could have been more tactful, \"I've had a bit of an emergency and I have to go, I don't think I'll be back,\" and leave. But she deserved to get called out, so I don't think you did anything wrong.\n\nETA: be *very* careful at work. Watch out for her trying to drag personal grievances into the office. Be prepared with a script. \"I was honoured and excited to be invited to her wedding, and I made sure to ask about any costs. She told me there were none, but when I arrived the menu had prices on it and was extravagantly expensive, more than I would be able to pay. I was subtle, but could have been more tactful, when I mentioned I was leaving. She is currently doing X, Y and Z and I am concerned that she is retaliating professionally for this.\"", "I've known about events like birthday or wedding dinners that everyone knows is a paid event in advance, like at a restaurant. But never one that charges people at the door by surprise. What did other guests think, I wonder?", "You don\u2019t think the bride is an asshole by breaking all tradition and making people pay for their meal at her wedding without telling them first?\n\ninviting someone to a party you are throwing and making them pay for food at your party is about the rudest thing a party host can do.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the social contract.  If I come to a party where there is a meal served,  then the host of the party is providing dinner.", "Can't fault OP for trying to be honest on what she was doing. OP isn't responsible for stupid wedding decisions and lack of forewarning from the bride.", "Depending on where they're from, it may be considered rude to leave without mentioning it to the couple. Even if for just a few minutes. It's not like she was trying to pick a fight", "No kidding. This has to be fake. There is no where on planet earth where wedding guests all pay for their dinner and order on the spot off a menu no less. The only slightly plausible explanation is they went to restaurant? Even then, that would be planned and paid for beforehand.", "Sorry, I'm not saying the country because it is quite specific. I'm a little worried that anyone who was there sees this post haha!\n\nBut no, I doubt it's a common practice where I live. However, I was told once by my aunt that she had to pitch in for the catering so I just asked in case.", "Call me entitled, but I expect to br provided for a meal and a couple of free drinks (doesn't have to be drinks with alcohol) when I'm invited to a wedding...", "It isn't new, been happening at least 10 years but it's always in lieu of gift and notice is given.", "I am sorry but i don't get this at all..she didn't say it was worth it, she said she didn't have enough cash to cover the costs of the food.  And who expects the wedding guests to pay for the good. Sure , a gift is expected from the guests side but,  my god,  paying for food in a wedding party is super strange ( bear my shock, coming from a different culture) . And since the friend had already cleared with the bride prior ,if there were any charges , the bride had stated that there weren't any. So not only is the bride not clear, it is extremely tacky to blow up.", "I agree that it was not tactful haha. And thanks for the really good advice :) \n\nAbout the $50, honestly (to me at least) it's rather pricey - if I recall correctly, the steak was 4oz (which isn't a big portion for $50). But I may be just stingy lol!", "I might have slipped out, and not come back.", "This is what I would have done. Snuck out on the pretence of a bathroom break or smoko or something. Get some 'air'.\n\nI wouldn't pay for a meal at a wedding and bring a gift.", "I'm not sure if credit cards were accepted, because I didn't bring mine to the wedding. (Pretty dumb of me because I should always carry some extra cash, but I assumed I wouldn't need it)\n\nAbout the specification, I was worried of being asked why I wasn't eating and I figured telling the truth would be better. (Not a good choice though)", "\\#3 Nope.", "You've never been to a wedding where you pay for the meal, because that's not a real thing. The people at the wedding are guests who don't pay for their own meals. Maybe they pay for their own drinks, but even that's seen as cheap in some circles.", "Thank you! WTF even is this?", "Cash bars are not tacky... TBH I think assuming it is on the bride and groom for you to be supplied alcohol is a bit tacky especially if they can not afford for a huge alcohol expense - weddings are expensive enough!!!\n\nOne caveat to that - is ensuring the guests are notified prior to the wedding that is will be a cash bar is vital though.", "That\u2019s tacky, too.\n\nYou throw a reception you can afford. That might mean your millionaire parents hire Martha Stewart to be your wedding planner (actual wedding I was at - last wedding Martha did as a planner) and you have a gorgeous and stunningly expensive wedding or it might mean the bride and groom, who are very young and don\u2019t have much money, do something much more homemade and stick to champagne punch for drinks (also actual wedding I was at). Both weddings were wonderful.\n\nYou don\u2019t charge your guests. Period. And no, setting a price to eat at the wedding in lieu of a gift is not ok either, both because it\u2019s still charging your guests and because you\u2019re telling your guests what they\u2019re going to spend on your \u201cpresent.\u201d Height of rudeness x 2.\n\nThat, obviously, is a culturally specific view of how weddings should work, not a criticism of something like the Japanese custom.", ">The Bride's response is BS too. \"Attendance Fees\" are not a thing at weddings.\n\nCertainly not relevant to OP's case, but FYI for some future trivia night, the culture of Japan (where I live) mandates what amounts to an \"attendance fee\" to be included in a wedding reception.  \n\n\nThere are lots of rules governing the amount and how its presented. For example, one should use uncirculated bills, but not presented in a way that can be split in half (e.g. not an amount given with an even number of bills), because giving the new couple something that can be easily split in half would be bad form, as if their marriage wouldn't last, or something like that.", "Was gonna say, I\u2019ve heard of a cash bar not a cash meal. Cash grab much?\n\nSuper tacky of them.", "I initially wanted to do that, but I was afraid of being \"caught lying\" (though chances were slim). She was also going around asking the few people who didn't order why they weren't eating, so I figured I'd rather be straight-up. I agree that I handled it badly though.", "I am all for this. I have a heap of food intolerances so have been known to disappear when a lot of seafood comes out, 3 out of 4 courses were inedible for me at my brothers wedding so I snuck out to McDonald's for a couple of muffins mostly because I desperately needed to soak up the alcohol and bread rolls were tough to eat after the first 2. My brother has no idea.\n\nMy best friend went to great lengths to order me a meal that then was served with the same sauces and oil as the rest of the meals. I still got entrees and desserts but that was noticeable as I was the maid of honour sitting next to her.\n\nA coworker invited another colleague who had a baby the same week so I got invited the day before. It was going well until I ate some jelly fish soup thinking it was a different kind of soup, but I just got other food discreetly as I was done on that menu.\n\nI have never in my life encountered a pay for a meal in the 15 weddings that I have been to. \n\nThis is on the bride. OP mentioned her approaching guests who weren't eating to ask why. Totally set herself up for failure! The wedding includes a meal. It's why they are expensive!", "No, it's not \"an American thing.\" I have NEVER heard of paying for your own food at a wedding. As someone else said, cash bars are tacky enough, but asking guests to pay for their own food? No.", "I haven\u2019t heard of anything like this at all. Granted I don\u2019t go to many weddings. My wife and I had our reception at a restaurant, but that\u2019s different. Any other weddings that had reception didn\u2019t require guests to pay for their meals.", "This is definitely not North American. I've never heard of anything like this and I'm dual Canadian-US. Here it is sometimes customary to give a gift that is relatively comparable in price to the amount of food you're eating, but that's about it.\n\nOP is NTA. \n\nAlso, OP even if you are from a weird country where you pay for your meal, you're still NTA because you asked about it in advance!!", "I believe it's reasonably common to ask guests to pay for their meal instead of a gift but it's usually written on the invite.", "Yes the bride is an asshole as well. But the sub is AM *I* THE ASSHOLE not is *SHE* the asshole.", "Yeah, but also, depending on where they're from, telling the bride \"hey Im going to duck out and eat at McDonalds real quick brb\" would be considered rude.\n\nWhere you're from might be pretty important if you can give us some INFO op.", "How? Like how does it usually go? Are their prices and choices on your invitation? I've never seen this", "It\u2019s not about stingy. It\u2019s not about the dollar value either. It\u2019s about the expectation and norm that when you\u2019re invited as a guest you shouldn\u2019t be required to pay. Had you known earlier you could have chosen not to attend. Being ensnared into paying is very bad form from the bride.", ">She was also going around asking the few people who didn't order why they weren't eating\n\nOkay, so, good news; the meltdown wasn't your fault. If she indeed did this those ppl probably told her the same thing, that the menu is too expensive, so she was probably already somewhat upset w ppls reactions.", "I'm not sure you handled it badly, though. Yeah you could have slipped out but as you said she would have noticed and honesty is rarely a bad thing.", "Wow. In that case NTA. I didn\u2019t think you were the A H, but I did wonder if could have been more discreet. Nope. How dare she question guests who were unable to eat?! \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re from, but here (England) it would be seen as incredibly tacky to expect guests to pay for their own food at a formal wedding meal.", "I'm just asking if it was an American thing because op also mentioned the possibility of an attendance fee and i know cash bar are a thing i learnt from people talking about the weddings they attended sometimes in America", "And certainly if you straight up asked the bride if there would be any expenses she wouldn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d.", "I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. Who does that? How rude!", "That\u2019s what ESH is for.", "I think you aren\u2019t familiar with how this sub works. Maybe read the rules?", "Then why is there an E S H option?", "Right. But the post is not set up in a \"her or me\" structure.", "Right. But the op never posed that question. Never asked our opinion on the bride. We know from the post that the bride is an asshole.", "Are you\nNew here?  The entire subreddit is set up that way.  Your choices are ESH, NTA and NAH.  Always.  those are the rules of the subreddit.
