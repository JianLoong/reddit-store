She should have been understanding instead of shaming your financial situation.", "Who the hell charges their wedding guests for food???", "Everyone gets dinner for free at a wedding, and in exchange they bring a gift.\n\nNo free dinner = no gift, and many couples kindly ask their friends to pay for dinner in lieu of a gift so that they can afford to share their special day with all their friends.\n\nNTA that bride was a liar.", "Yeah, you're the asshole. It is exceptionally easy to slip out of a wedding for even half-hour periods and not be noticed. Many slip out for cigarettes etc. Even a restroom break can take ten minutes. You said it was 5 minutes away. You easily could have just dipped out and been back in the same time it takes to smoke a newport. \n\nYou didn't need to tell her and you shouldn't have.", "ESH\n\nFirstly every wedding I\u2019ve attended has had the meal included, so yeah I would 100% expect to be told if I was having to pay for my meal\n\nBut you should have just ducked out rather than making a big deal with the bride on her wedding day", "NTA, what does an attendance fee even mean? Sounds like she's justifying lying to your face. Who charges people to eat at their wedding??\n\nThough I feel like this could have been avoided by simply not informing the bride, you two don't seem especially close (\"colleague\") so I doubt she would have noticed your absence.", "NTA\nPeople are so uptight about weddings. I'm not saying what you did was tasteful, but it's understandable and the bride gave you incorrect information. Ya gotta eat.", "NTA, never heard of an wedding where you have to pay for the food! Usually if you have to pay, it is for the extra alcohol, but not for the food. That is such an unusual way to handle things that she definitely should have told you it beforehand, and if I had to guess, you weren't the only one surprised.", "NTA. No-one expects to pay for a meal at a wedding.", "NTA. Never before heard of a wedding where you have to pay for the food. If there's a food fee, she should have told you or it should have been clarified in the invitation. \n\nI do think that you handle it a bit clumsily - you should have just gone to McDonald's in secret and came back later.

This is the first I\u2019ve heard about something like this, but it doesn\u2019t surprise me.

I've never been to a wedding where the guests have been expected to pay for their meals.", "NTA wtf. Where are you from? Because every wedding I've been to the couple pays for the food (or whoever's paying for the wedding). This should've been disclosed in the invitation AT LEAST.\n\nYou probably could've snuck out and eaten and returned, but that's just me being nitpicky. Bride and groom are TA.

Never heard of this...\n\nHard to believe this story is real, sounds like some 12 year old wrote it...", "NTA, what is with this new trend of having wedding guests pay for their meal? Pay for drinks, fine, pay for the photo booth, fine, but the meal? This is just whoever planned the wedding being cheap, I would have no problem losing a friend over something that stupid.

Especially since you usually already pay for clothes, transportation and a gift. But as someone else commented I wouldn\u2019t have asked. I\u2019d have gone and eaten and come back. She probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed.", "Really curious where you live that 'attendance fees' at weddings are a possibility, and 'michelin-star' restaurants don't have credit card facillities. \n\nAnd also why you had to specify to her that you were getting McDonald's instead of just slipping out?", "I'm gunna say NTA, because in this case \"asshole\" implies some intent. At 25, though, you should know that **1)** a wedding can be a *super* stressful time for the bride (and groom and family) and that **2)** it's a day where the bride is allowed to put herself (and her groom) at the center of things, and **3)** weddings are financed in part by the guests.  \n\n\nBecause of #1 and #2, consider to cut her some slack in your heart, for it was likely the pressure of the day talking.  \nOh, and she didn't *lie* to you, she just assumed that you knew the deal. (That being said, I've never been to a wedding that had a menu with prices, so that seems a bit odd; normally you're given a few selections and you make your choice known when you RSVP.)", "NTA, attendance fee, at a wedding? What plane is she from? People already \"pay\" but bringing gifts and she is proud she didn't put an entrance fee as well? The food is payed per order? Some crazy wedding lol\n\nAnyway, the only thing you did wrong is skipping a meal prior. It could happen that you didn't like anything on the table so you'd still be hungry. There's no need to eat extra prior (unless you are a very picky eater), but skipping a meal to be extra hungry... IS CHEAP for my taste. As for the rest, leaving quietly would be better than asking for a permission, honestly \n\nAll in all, you ate NTA but you lack some tact.", "YTA for having a go at the bride on her wedding day.  You could have left slyly and then explained after the fact.\n\nIn terms of expecting to pay, I'm very on the fence.  I've never been to a wedding where you pay for the meal, but I've only been to small weddings (though I have always had to buy my own drinks so carried cash or card for the event).  So I don't think you're awful for not expecting the cost, but you could've handled it a lot better", "NTA - some people are so tacky it literally oozes out of everything they do.", "NTA. Cash bars are tacky enough. I\u2019ve literally never heard of attendance fees or charging for the meal. Who does that?", "INFO: Where do you live that it's acceptable for people to charge their GUESTS money for the food at their wedding? \n\nNTA.", "Their solution to feeding their guests was *ridiculous*, they should not be profiting off the people they've asked to join them to celebrate their marriage! I hope you grabbed your gift back on the way out. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI've literally never heard of a wedding where you have to pay for your meal. I'm genuinely baffled she expected you to pay that, especially after saying there wouldn't be a cost.\n\nI mean you definitely could have just slipped out quietly and not said anything. But it sounds like she's the one that escalated the situation afterwards as well.", "NTA.\n\nWhilst paying for you meal instead of a gift is becoming more common guests are notified on the invites so they can just not attend if they dont wanna pay $50.", "NTA - But I think you handled it wrong. You shouldn't have asked her if it was okay to leave and get McDonald's. You should have done it and come back. The bride/your colleague does sound like a bit of a jerk and she shouldn't have humiliated you that way.\n\nI've never been to a wedding where I had to pay for my own food, and I've been to some cheap ass weddings and some expensive ass weddings. Next time, you'll know to be prepared. Also did you buy her a gift? Because if you didn't and showed up to get a free meal, then you're a bit of an asshole.", "NTA. Who invites people to pay for their own meal anyway? I know the principle of potluck, but this was no potluck. People should not invite other people if they are not paying for the food.", "I have never heard of a wedding having a menu where a guest had to pay for the dinner. The bride & groom are assholes for not having that put on the invitations for everyone to know ahead of time.", "NTA, I have never heard of guests paying for the food at a wedding before. At least it doesn't happen where I am from. Weddings are stressful but still your colleague shouldn't have been so harsh about it. No one walks into a wedding expecting to pay for the food. You could have just excused yourself without explaining the reason but then again the entire situation is weird to me.", "Who pays for food at a wedding? NTA. \n\nIt's nearly always catered, either sit down meal, buffet, pot-luck - every type of wedding I've been to had never requested payment for food. Drinks, yes, obviously but not food. \n\nIf I were you, I'd have just ducked out quietly and gone for food and come back. If it was queried then make up an excuse about needing something from your hotel.", "NTA. She lied and then got pissy at a problem her deceitful nature caused. Good luck to the husband, he'll need it.", "NTA\n\nCharging people to eat at a wedding is just cheap and tacky. As the bride and groom, you are the hosts of a celebration and you damn well cater for your guests. If you can\u2019t afford a Michelin starred 5 course meal, you do a cheaper option. You do not put that onus on your guests. They have stumped up to pay for nice clothes, transport, possibly a hotel room, and a gift. They should not be expected to pay the costs of your wedding too.", "NTA\n\n>You literally assumed that you'd get a free five-course dinner.\n\nUm, yeah, you did. Wedding guests aren't typically asked to pay for their dinner. And you'd already asked about costs and been told there weren't any.\n\n>there is no attendance fee!\n\nWTF is an attendance fee? Was she going to have a bouncer at the door collecting a cover charge? \n\nLook, you said this woman is your coworker, which could complicate things. But holy hell, is she entitled. You are not the AH here, she is.", "NTA. Why would you have to pay for a meal at a wedding? That\u2019s insane. Especially without a warning. \n\nIf they can\u2019t afford to throw a party this expensive they should have done it differently. I went to an amazing wedding where the bride, a few of her other friends and I spent the whole day cooking nice food for everyone. It\u2019s one of my favorite memories.", "NTA. I have never heard of a wedding where the guests are expected to pay for dinner. Especially without any notice.\n\nThe Bride's response is BS too. \"Attendance Fees\" are not a thing at weddings. You asked and she said there was no cost. The misunderstanding is on her.", "Nta I've never known weddings to charge for food or attendance", "NTA. I have NEVER heard of guests being expected to pay for food at a wedding. Ever. She publicly humiliated herself.", "Info: why didn\u2019t you just slip out and go get your food instead of making it a point to tell her?", "ESH\n\nThe right thing to do was to excuse yourself (and keep the reason to yourself). She lied to you which is really messed up. But there was no reason for you to actually tell her you were going to McDonald's.", "NTA, it does not make sense to have you pay for a meal at another persons wedding, and you brought a gift? I think the bride and groom are the once being cheap. \n\nBut as others also have stated, I would also just have slipped out without anyone noticing and slipped back in again.", "NTA! I have been to over 30 weddings in 6 countries, and I have NEVER paid for the meal. That is always the most expensive part of the wedding, no matter the budget. There is nothing wrong with being a young person who has to preplan big expenses to save up for them or lives within a budget, and no one should make you feel bad about that. It is great that you have a responsible attitude about money.\n\nIt's the stingiest tackiest thing I have heard of for someone to do with zero warning. And it isn't about income, it is about the bride wanting a fancier wedding than she could afford, and forcing her guests to pay for it with no notice. I've been to every kind of wedding from a backyard wedding to a destination wedding on a Greek island, and I have never paid for the food. Occasionally, you see a cash bar after the first few drinks, but even that gets most people's eyes rolling.\n\nBtw, I loved that you went to Mcdonald's. It made me laugh.", "I\u2019m half French half Chinese living in the US. And I\u2019ve been to weddings in all three cultures as well as several others. \n\nI have never, ever once heard of a wedding that charges guests for dinner. Maybe a cash bar at the most, but never ever once has the wedded couple presented me with a price list to order from for the wedding reception dinner. And never in any culture I have experienced would that be acceptable. \n\nIf I even joked about doing this I would be laughed out of the room. \n\nI think you desperately need some new friends?", "NTA. Id leave a wedding that expected me to pay for the meal too. Honestly you were way more polite about it than I would have been too. Expecting guests to pay for their own food at a wedding is cheap and shitty. If you can't afford to pay for the food at your wedding then you need to reconsider your entire wedding budget.", "Lord, NO, definitely NTA.\n\nThe bride should have told you that the meals would cost money (and how much at that) I understand wanting to have top-notch food, but expecting people to pay hundreds of dollars to eat at a wedding they'd been invited to? Hell no.\n\nAt the very least, it should have been common knowledge that the food wouldn't be free and the prices should have been made public for the guests, imo. (Not sure how common this practive is in other countries though, but where I live this is not normal at all, so maybe that colors my perception. Still, nta.)", "absolutely NTA. Is this an American thing? since when you have to pay for a wedding dinner???\n\n\nand tbh, just in case: your friends and boyfriend are also assholes", "NTA. Who the hell expects guests to pay for their food at the wedding?", "NTA. That's not a wedding, that's a party at a restaurant. And her excuse that there was no \"attendance fee\" is ridiculous because *that's not a thing either*. She wanted a fancy wedding that she couldn't afford, so instead of doing the barely veiled \"give me money gifts\" routine, she just literally charged her guests for food.\n\nI'm guessing the reason you were invited was to fill out numbers when her other guests refused to pay to attend *her* wedding.\n\nYou could have been more tactful, \"I've had a bit of an emergency and I have to go, I don't think I'll be back,\" and leave. But she deserved to get called out, so I don't think you did anything wrong.\n\nETA: be *very* careful at work. Watch out for her trying to drag personal grievances into the office. Be prepared with a script. \"I was honoured and excited to be invited to her wedding, and I made sure to ask about any costs. She told me there were none, but when I arrived the menu had prices on it and was extravagantly expensive, more than I would be able to pay. I was subtle, but could have been more tactful, when I mentioned I was leaving.

I gave her a color and she could choose any dress or style she wanted. I don't understand why people get so weird about weddings. Then again, my wedding was laid back and so am I. NTA", "Same", "RIGHT?!?! I need to know as well!", "I am going to need the link to that story if you please.", "The difference between beer and wine and a full bar at my wedding was 3 grand. I\u2019ll take \u201ctacky\u201d for that price.", "This has to be fake af. Literally nobody would have even asked in the first place if there was a fee. And then to find out there is one\u2026OP is drafting a fake scenario without even having been to a wedding before.", "Yeah this was a really dumb faux pas by the OP. I've been to weddings where the food wasn't good or the portions were small. You do the McDonald's run discretely, or afterwards. You don't freaking tell the bride on her wedding day what you're doing, they don't need to know.", "> you could have ordered the cheapest thing on the menu\n\nbut\n\n>However, the only other option was to simply not eat, as I didn't bring enough money for both a meal and a ride back.", "Definitely not an American thing. At least not at any wedding I've seen, attended, or heard about.", "Who the hell charges wedding guests for their meals like it's a restaurant?!\n\nThe bride had the gall to call OP cheap, but she's the real cheap one and also a bridezilla AH.\n\nOP isn't anywhere close to being an AH.", "But that is basically a wedding gift! You have a minimum sum to present to the couple.", "This is common in Chinese and Korean weddings too. Wonder where the wedding OP was attending was\u2026", "Australian here, its not a common thing over here never heard of it in fact, that couple was just stingy", "Aussie here! I've never heard of this- you may have just known a tight ass.", "Nuh. This is not a thing in Australia! Guests are never expected to pay!", "Aussie chiming in. I've never been to a wedding here that hasn't included a meal paid for by the couple getting married.", "This is absolutely NOT an Australian thing", "Nah, it'd be weird here too", "I\u2019m Australian and I\u2019ve never paid for a meal at a wedding", "Another Aussie- we paid for EVERYTHING for our guests, from accommodation to meals to breakfast the day after. I have also been to heaps of weddings and never been asked to cover a cent. We definitely consider the comfort and meals of our guests as a high priority. I even had multiple special meals and desserts covered for our friends. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA 100% though. Asking to pay for your meals is a total dick move.", "Uh no. I have never been to, or heard of a wedding here in Australia where guests were expected to cover the cost their meals! We are hospitable!", "My partner is Australian, this is not a cultural norm. OP's friend is just cheap. They wanted the grandeur of a Michelin starred meal at the wedding without the means to pay for it so they offloaded the cost onto the guests. She's bogan trash.", "Yeah, as others have said, I\u2019ve never been to a reception where I was expected to pay a cent in Australia.", "I agree with you. You don't pull this at your wedding and then have the audacity to walk around asking for validation and confronting people nastily that don't give it to you.", "Hey, I guess they can do that if they want, but not making it clear when you invite someone and then getting angry is just so out of touch.", "Yes. At the very least, cake and punch in the afternoon, or an afternoon tea type thing with sandwiches and finger foods or something.", "Most countries are specific. Are you saying it is so small they might figure it out?", "\"Handling it badly\" would have been asking those other people if they wanted you to bring back something for them.\n\n>Getting angry as well, she replied: \"What I meant was there is no attendance fee!\n\nI know that people have demanded that gifts fall within certain price ranges, and that some cultures have traditions of monetary gifts, and so forth, but I don't believe I know of anywhere where wedding guests would expect to be charged an attendance fee.", "Oh yeah no she did the same to other people who weren\u2019t prepared to spend that much $$$ on a meal.", "Why would there be an attendence fee for the wedding? I've never heard of such a thing. I have worked and attended weddings across multiple cultures and not once did guests ever pay for dinner. I'm having a hard time believing this.\n\nWere the other guests aware about paying for dinner? Did anyone else leave because of it? Did you hear any other complaints?", "Having beer and wine included makes it no longer a cash bar.", "That's exactly what I'm thinking. I'd have waited until after the wedding.", "Well, then just slip out quietly. Or, as mentioned, to excuse themselves for another reason. The point is that they didn't need to make this a thing where they involve the bride. Even if it sucks, that's a conversation for another day.", "Yeah, it's an asshole move from the couple, but that conversation doesn't need to happen right then and there. You can slip out, get your food, and have a conversation about it a few days later", "Sorry, I\u2019ve lived in a culture where this is the case for so long, I forgot what\u2019s it like in (what I assume is) America", "Yeah no that's not an attendance fee, that's a wedding gift. Just that you gift cash instead of buying something off a registry.", "Nono, the invites said guests meals were *covered* so they paid for our meals. I\u2019ve just never seen that on an invitation before and wondered why that even needed to be included.", "They mean guests get a few drinks for free and after that guests need to pay for more alcohol.", "What they meant is you don\u2019t even need to write that down. It\u2019s a given meals are included.", "Beer and wine weddings are a thing here that doesn\u2019t limit how many drinks you get, it\u2019s just that only beer and wine is offered for alcohol since hard liquor is so much more. That\u2019s what I did for my wedding. Far cheaper than an open."]}
