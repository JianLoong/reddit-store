She should have been understanding instead of shaming your financial situation.", "Who the hell charges their wedding guests for food???", "Everyone gets dinner for free at a wedding, and in exchange they bring a gift.\n\nNo free dinner = no gift, and many couples kindly ask their friends to pay for dinner in lieu of a gift so that they can afford to share their special day with all their friends.\n\nNTA that bride was a liar.", "Yeah, you're the asshole. It is exceptionally easy to slip out of a wedding for even half-hour periods and not be noticed. Many slip out for cigarettes etc. Even a restroom break can take ten minutes. You said it was 5 minutes away. You easily could have just dipped out and been back in the same time it takes to smoke a newport. \n\nYou didn't need to tell her and you shouldn't have.", "ESH\n\nFirstly every wedding I\u2019ve attended has had the meal included, so yeah I would 100% expect to be told if I was having to pay for my meal\n\nBut you should have just ducked out rather than making a big deal with the bride on her wedding day", "NTA, what does an attendance fee even mean? Sounds like she's justifying lying to your face. Who charges people to eat at their wedding??\n\nThough I feel like this could have been avoided by simply not informing the bride, you two don't seem especially close (\"colleague\") so I doubt she would have noticed your absence.", "NTA\nPeople are so uptight about weddings. I'm not saying what you did was tasteful, but it's understandable and the bride gave you incorrect information. Ya gotta eat.", "NTA, never heard of an wedding where you have to pay for the food! Usually if you have to pay, it is for the extra alcohol, but not for the food. That is such an unusual way to handle things that she definitely should have told you it beforehand, and if I had to guess, you weren't the only one surprised.", "NTA. No-one expects to pay for a meal at a wedding.", "NTA. Never before heard of a wedding where you have to pay for the food. If there's a food fee, she should have told you or it should have been clarified in the invitation. \n\nI do think that you handle it a bit clumsily - you should have just gone to McDonald's in secret and came back later.

This is the first I\u2019ve heard about something like this, but it doesn\u2019t surprise me.

I've never been to a wedding where the guests have been expected to pay for their meals.", "NTA wtf. Where are you from? Because every wedding I've been to the couple pays for the food (or whoever's paying for the wedding). This should've been disclosed in the invitation AT LEAST.\n\nYou probably could've snuck out and eaten and returned, but that's just me being nitpicky. Bride and groom are TA.

Never heard of this...\n\nHard to believe this story is real, sounds like some 12 year old wrote it...", "NTA, what is with this new trend of having wedding guests pay for their meal? Pay for drinks, fine, pay for the photo booth, fine, but the meal? This is just whoever planned the wedding being cheap, I would have no problem losing a friend over something that stupid.

Especially since you usually already pay for clothes, transportation and a gift. But as someone else commented I wouldn\u2019t have asked. I\u2019d have gone and eaten and come back. She probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed.", "Really curious where you live that 'attendance fees' at weddings are a possibility, and 'michelin-star' restaurants don't have credit card facillities. \n\nAnd also why you had to specify to her that you were getting McDonald's instead of just slipping out?", "I'm gunna say NTA, because in this case \"asshole\" implies some intent. At 25, though, you should know that **1)** a wedding can be a *super* stressful time for the bride (and groom and family) and that **2)** it's a day where the bride is allowed to put herself (and her groom) at the center of things, and **3)** weddings are financed in part by the guests.  \n\n\nBecause of #1 and #2, consider to cut her some slack in your heart, for it was likely the pressure of the day talking.  \nOh, and she didn't *lie* to you, she just assumed that you knew the deal. (That being said, I've never been to a wedding that had a menu with prices, so that seems a bit odd; normally you're given a few selections and you make your choice known when you RSVP.)", "NTA, attendance fee, at a wedding? What plane is she from? People already \"pay\" but bringing gifts and she is proud she didn't put an entrance fee as well? The food is payed per order? Some crazy wedding lol\n\nAnyway, the only thing you did wrong is skipping a meal prior. It could happen that you didn't like anything on the table so you'd still be hungry. There's no need to eat extra prior (unless you are a very picky eater), but skipping a meal to be extra hungry... IS CHEAP for my taste. As for the rest, leaving quietly would be better than asking for a permission, honestly \n\nAll in all, you ate NTA but you lack some tact.", "YTA for having a go at the bride on her wedding day.  You could have left slyly and then explained after the fact.\n\nIn terms of expecting to pay, I'm very on the fence.  I've never been to a wedding where you pay for the meal, but I've only been to small weddings (though I have always had to buy my own drinks so carried cash or card for the event).  So I don't think you're awful for not expecting the cost, but you could've handled it a lot better", "NTA - some people are so tacky it literally oozes out of everything they do.", "NTA. Cash bars are tacky enough. I\u2019ve literally never heard of attendance fees or charging for the meal. Who does that?", "INFO: Where do you live that it's acceptable for people to charge their GUESTS money for the food at their wedding? \n\nNTA.", "Their solution to feeding their guests was *ridiculous*, they should not be profiting off the people they've asked to join them to celebrate their marriage! I hope you grabbed your gift back on the way out. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI've literally never heard of a wedding where you have to pay for your meal. I'm genuinely baffled she expected you to pay that, especially after saying there wouldn't be a cost.\n\nI mean you definitely could have just slipped out quietly and not said anything. But it sounds like she's the one that escalated the situation afterwards as well.", "NTA.\n\nWhilst paying for you meal instead of a gift is becoming more common guests are notified on the invites so they can just not attend if they dont wanna pay $50.", "NTA - But I think you handled it wrong. You shouldn't have asked her if it was okay to leave and get McDonald's. You should have done it and come back. The bride/your colleague does sound like a bit of a jerk and she shouldn't have humiliated you that way.\n\nI've never been to a wedding where I had to pay for my own food, and I've been to some cheap ass weddings and some expensive ass weddings. Next time, you'll know to be prepared. Also did you buy her a gift? Because if you didn't and showed up to get a free meal, then you're a bit of an asshole.", "NTA. Who invites people to pay for their own meal anyway? I know the principle of potluck, but this was no potluck. People should not invite other people if they are not paying for the food.", "I have never heard of a wedding having a menu where a guest had to pay for the dinner. The bride & groom are assholes for not having that put on the invitations for everyone to know ahead of time.", "NTA, I have never heard of guests paying for the food at a wedding before. At least it doesn't happen where I am from. Weddings are stressful but still your colleague shouldn't have been so harsh about it. No one walks into a wedding expecting to pay for the food. You could have just excused yourself without explaining the reason but then again the entire situation is weird to me.", "Who pays for food at a wedding? NTA. \n\nIt's nearly always catered, either sit down meal, buffet, pot-luck - every type of wedding I've been to had never requested payment for food. Drinks, yes, obviously but not food. \n\nIf I were you, I'd have just ducked out quietly and gone for food and come back. If it was queried then make up an excuse about needing something from your hotel.", "NTA. She lied and then got pissy at a problem her deceitful nature caused. Good luck to the husband, he'll need it.", "NTA\n\nCharging people to eat at a wedding is just cheap and tacky. As the bride and groom, you are the hosts of a celebration and you damn well cater for your guests. If you can\u2019t afford a Michelin starred 5 course meal, you do a cheaper option. You do not put that onus on your guests. They have stumped up to pay for nice clothes, transport, possibly a hotel room, and a gift. They should not be expected to pay the costs of your wedding too.", "NTA\n\n>You literally assumed that you'd get a free five-course dinner.\n\nUm, yeah, you did. Wedding guests aren't typically asked to pay for their dinner. And you'd already asked about costs and been told there weren't any.\n\n>there is no attendance fee!\n\nWTF is an attendance fee? Was she going to have a bouncer at the door collecting a cover charge? \n\nLook, you said this woman is your coworker, which could complicate things. But holy hell, is she entitled. You are not the AH here, she is.", "NTA. Why would you have to pay for a meal at a wedding? That\u2019s insane. Especially without a warning. \n\nIf they can\u2019t afford to throw a party this expensive they should have done it differently. I went to an amazing wedding where the bride, a few of her other friends and I spent the whole day cooking nice food for everyone. It\u2019s one of my favorite memories.", "NTA. I have never heard of a wedding where the guests are expected to pay for dinner. Especially without any notice.\n\nThe Bride's response is BS too. \"Attendance Fees\" are not a thing at weddings. You asked and she said there was no cost. The misunderstanding is on her.", "Nta I've never known weddings to charge for food or attendance", "NTA. I have NEVER heard of guests being expected to pay for food at a wedding. Ever. She publicly humiliated herself.", "Info: why didn\u2019t you just slip out and go get your food instead of making it a point to tell her?", "ESH\n\nThe right thing to do was to excuse yourself (and keep the reason to yourself). She lied to you which is really messed up. But there was no reason for you to actually tell her you were going to McDonald's.", "NTA, it does not make sense to have you pay for a meal at another persons wedding, and you brought a gift? I think the bride and groom are the once being cheap. \n\nBut as others also have stated, I would also just have slipped out without anyone noticing and slipped back in again.", "NTA! I have been to over 30 weddings in 6 countries, and I have NEVER paid for the meal. That is always the most expensive part of the wedding, no matter the budget. There is nothing wrong with being a young person who has to preplan big expenses to save up for them or lives within a budget, and no one should make you feel bad about that. It is great that you have a responsible attitude about money.\n\nIt's the stingiest tackiest thing I have heard of for someone to do with zero warning. And it isn't about income, it is about the bride wanting a fancier wedding than she could afford, and forcing her guests to pay for it with no notice. I've been to every kind of wedding from a backyard wedding to a destination wedding on a Greek island, and I have never paid for the food. Occasionally, you see a cash bar after the first few drinks, but even that gets most people's eyes rolling.\n\nBtw, I loved that you went to Mcdonald's. It made me laugh.", "I\u2019m half French half Chinese living in the US. And I\u2019ve been to weddings in all three cultures as well as several others. \n\nI have never, ever once heard of a wedding that charges guests for dinner. Maybe a cash bar at the most, but never ever once has the wedded couple presented me with a price list to order from for the wedding reception dinner. And never in any culture I have experienced would that be acceptable. \n\nIf I even joked about doing this I would be laughed out of the room. \n\nI think you desperately need some new friends?", "NTA. Id leave a wedding that expected me to pay for the meal too. Honestly you were way more polite about it than I would have been too. Expecting guests to pay for their own food at a wedding is cheap and shitty. If you can't afford to pay for the food at your wedding then you need to reconsider your entire wedding budget.", "Lord, NO, definitely NTA.\n\nThe bride should have told you that the meals would cost money (and how much at that) I understand wanting to have top-notch food, but expecting people to pay hundreds of dollars to eat at a wedding they'd been invited to? Hell no.\n\nAt the very least, it should have been common knowledge that the food wouldn't be free and the prices should have been made public for the guests, imo. (Not sure how common this practive is in other countries though, but where I live this is not normal at all, so maybe that colors my perception. Still, nta.)", "absolutely NTA. Is this an American thing? since when you have to pay for a wedding dinner???\n\n\nand tbh, just in case: your friends and boyfriend are also assholes", "NTA. Who the hell expects guests to pay for their food at the wedding?", "NTA. That's not a wedding, that's a party at a restaurant. And her excuse that there was no \"attendance fee\" is ridiculous because *that's not a thing either*. She wanted a fancy wedding that she couldn't afford, so instead of doing the barely veiled \"give me money gifts\" routine, she just literally charged her guests for food.\n\nI'm guessing the reason you were invited was to fill out numbers when her other guests refused to pay to attend *her* wedding.\n\nYou could have been more tactful, \"I've had a bit of an emergency and I have to go, I don't think I'll be back,\" and leave. But she deserved to get called out, so I don't think you did anything wrong.\n\nETA: be *very* careful at work. Watch out for her trying to drag personal grievances into the office. Be prepared with a script. \"I was honoured and excited to be invited to her wedding, and I made sure to ask about any costs. She told me there were none, but when I arrived the menu had prices on it and was extravagantly expensive, more than I would be able to pay. I was subtle, but could have been more tactful, when I mentioned I was leaving.

And it sounds like she went for somewhere pricey to boot.", "But, when it is charged, goshugi then customarily become unnecessary, so it IS the wedding gift.", "Taiwanese, can confirm. While it is courtesy for a guest to give cash gifts it's still rude for the married to demand them", "Functionally there\u2019s no difference, save when it\u2019s counted", "The mother thought it was a good idea \ud83d\ude01 \nThe reverend of their congregation was annoyed and tried to offer other alternatives. Like members of the congregation cooking and using the church hall for the reception/dinner. But that wasn't special enough for the bride.", "You married your mom?!", "Oh weird. I must have been combining comments. My bad. Still, that's not cool and I'm sorry you were there alone!", "Yeah that\u2019s correct we had been in a relationship for a little over a year, so it was fair enough he didn\u2019t get an invite I guess.", "This is traditional for the community I married into  (family does the meal at the church). It was a different experience than the fancy weddings I was used to but it honestly was so much more fun.", "I would have loved that option. Real loving community effort. Cant believe that was overlooked and not good enough!!", "Nah he should still get one", "Interesting. Haven't heard of them. Here it is generally enough for the toasts and a few drinks after. We added on some cocktails for everyone beforehand as well though this partly because Covid had cut our guest list massively which brought down costs.\n\nOpen bars do happen if it is a rich enough family and they trust all their guests not to get too messy.", "lmao thanks it was a local event so at least there was no travel involved! I\u2019d have probably politely declined the invite otherwise", "We did beer and pitchers of margaritas because we got married at a Mexican restaurant (ceremony and reception) and what\u2019s a Mexican food buffet without margaritas? Then my sister had a Cooper\u2019s hawk wine membership she had let build up for 2 years so she bought wine to add to the mix.\n\nBut beer and wine packages may be $15/person while open bar is $30/person for example"]}
