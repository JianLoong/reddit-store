I don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t pay for their seats to be together and expect people to move for them. I travel with my kids and never ask people to move.

Unless the man has seizures, or some other condition that requires immediate intervention, there is no reason to babysit an adult.

Sounds like a bit of a have to me; she went with the cheap seat with the hope that she could use her disabled husband to get a free upgrade to a better seat.", "NTA. Anyone who pays for a seat and refuses to give it up because someone else planned poorly will never be the asshole in my book.

They knew what they were doing.", "NTA.", "NTA at all. You paid extra for your seat and her lack of preparation for her flight left her in a pickle. They should have pre-booked their seats or checked in earlier.", "NTA\n\nShe should have booked seats together or asked someone in the non upgraded seat to switch. Or pay you to switch. $1000 per hour of flight is my current rate. Cash only and must be paid before switching.", "NTA. And while I know many will say if the needed to sit together they should have booked two seats together, but I also know that doesn't always work if the flight is cancelled, changed, or the type of plane is changed. However, if they really needed to sit together, she should have tried to work with the desk agents or other staff to make that happen, NOT try and get you to change seats.\n\nIt also could be that they weren't able to book 2 seats together, and she was just hoping that she could \"make\" someone switch with her.", "NTA.

The airline should have taken that into account and made it their priority to seat them together rather than leaving it up to their customers. Offer someone an upgrade for free to open two seats together.", "Or asked them personal in HER aisle to take her husband's better seat, leaving then in worse seats but together.", "This is a good point and I wonder if they asked - some airlines are trash at this, but some companies will accommodate or at least attempt to when there's an accessibility need, which if I recall is often an option to indicate when booking things.", "I fly regularly for work through a multitude of airlines. At no point in the last several years have I not been able to select my seat when buying my ticket regardless of ticket class anywhere in the world outside of tiny domestic puddle jumpers in 3rd world countries. They only way they couldn't get seats together is if they ordered too late and all of the window and isle seats were full which would be entirely their fault."]}
