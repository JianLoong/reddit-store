The only time I have ever been moved without prior consent was the time they bumped me to a left window seat in first class so they could sell my seat. No complaints there! Any other time there was a change proposed, I\u2019ve been asked, and declined. I don\u2019t care who you are, what\u2019s wrong, why you want my seat, etc. Either offer me a left window or single first class seat or gtfo.\n\nI also have *never* used any special assistance crap for booking, as that would prevent me from making the best choice for myself. You also don\u2019t have to do that. At least not with AA. After booking, if a wheelchair is needed, it can be requested while no other changes are made. \n\nI figured this all out with an afternoon on Google, never having booked my own travel before then, and only having flown once before. It\u2019s not secret information.", "That sounds like an issue for you to take up with the airline. That\u2019s absolutely not OPs problem to solve regardless of the other people\u2019s intention", "This seems\u2026off\u2026", "A 1h30 flight is so short, tbh, so yeah why not?", "I very recently traveled with my husband, who couldn\u2019t walk and needed my help. We paid for seat selection and ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT received notification our seats had changed and we weren\u2019t together anymore. So yeah, it sure does happen. (We were able to fix the problem at the gate, fyi. It was a transatlantic flight.)", "Yes, these posts seem to come up all the time. I've been flying for 30+ years and have never been switched from a seat I've chosen when booking other than if the flight was completely canceled and I was rescheduled on a different flight entirely.", "I'm disabled but, luckily, only need a cane to ambulate. Unfortunately, airlines damage much more costly and essential equipment for disabled people on the daily. \n\nI appreciate the complexities of air travel, but man is it *rough* to do it depending on your disability and what you might need.", "> tiny domestic puddle jumpers in 3rd world countries.\n\nLike Spirit!", "Because they\u2019ve paid up to $50 additional (depending on the airline) on top of the standard fare to have THAT seat. Are you going to give them the $50 they spent for no reason?", "Because they paid extra for their seat. Why should they basically waste their money?", "Having worked for 3 airlines, \"special assistance\" is usually the Gate agent and some random baggage handler (or 2).  When you reach out to the airline and tell them you need assistance, the airline typically just makes a note in your record so the ticket counter/gate agent is aware a wheelchairtaislechair may be needed.  In larger airports, the airline may or may not schedule an electric cart based on your request.  \n\nIf you need to be seated with someone to assist you, you need to book ahead and pay for premium seating so you can be seated with your assistant.  Otherwise the airline may or may not seat you together depending on how full the flights are.  You would be surprised how many able-bodied people pull the \"I'm disabled and need to be seated by my traveling companion!\" card - waiting until they are checking in to let anyone know.  Airline folks have become numb to hearing it.", "Are you booking basic economy fares? All fares except BE give you the option for advance seat selection (unless you're flying an airline like SW that doesn't do assigned seating or an ultra low cost carrier like Spirit that charges extra for everything). I always select my seats at booking in the main cabin on Delta, JetBlue and American.", "Personally, I feel that they should at least ask at the before boarding.  There most likely could be someone willing to switch.  I try to make sure I can a right aisle seat for my husband because of his disability.  If we can\u2019t sit together, c\u2019est la vie.  I would never ask someone to exchange seats so we could sit together.", "They don't have to, but in a circumstance like this where someone might need additional help due to a disability, it would have been kind.\n\nBut I was mostly replying to the person seeming to imply that 1h30 was a long flight, which... it isn't. Like, I get not wanting to change your premium-location seat in a longer flight, but 1h30 is nothing.", "Isn't that just a fee for being disabled then? Like a hotel isn't going to charge you extra to accommodate a disability, but the airlines can apparently make you pay more to be seated by your companion. If there's an emergency, people who can't pay for the guaranteed seat are at the whim of a stranger.", "You had a great chance to expand your cultural competency with some grace but ya blew it. Maybe next time!", "I\u2019m confused by this though. My mom needs some assistance getting around the airport. When I book our tickets after I pay I can go in and put in that she needs special assistance from a list of options. One of these options is for people that have their own wheelchair. Selecting that option does not change me paying for and selecting our seats myself. Can you explain what might be different about that?", "I've booked enough flights I remember that's always a question while filling out your information. So I'm also confused about the special assistance?"]}
