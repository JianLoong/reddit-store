A lot of my flights are booked last minute (I\u2019m usually finding out a few days in advance that I\u2019m going somewhere) so while airlines try and say they\u2019re random I assume it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll be bumped if you book later which is why it happens more frequently to me. The occasional traveler could easily never experience it, especially if they are booking several weeks or months in advance. \n\nAs for keeping families together, usually this is avoidable by just communicating to the gate agent if something does happen. It\u2019s rare their hands are truly tied, it often comes down to being polite and they are usually more than willing to accommodate what you need.", "literally had this happen last week, im diabetic so drank a lot on the train to the airport, once in the airport i was with special assistance in a wheelchair (also travelling alone) we ended up at the gate like really early and because of people boarding and some security issue we had to wait in the lift for nearly 2 hours, if you know anything abt diabetes you know you pee a lot more than normal people, so by the time we were getting on the plane i was in so much pain, and another woman was in the same situation as me from waiting to go to the bathroom for like over three hours since being with special assistance, then ofc we couldn\u2019t go as soon as we were on the plane bc we had to wait til take off and seatbelt signs were off, the two of us literally were so fast in the bathroom as soon as we could lmao.", "That fare is perfect for me -  a backpack and underseat luggage carry-on only passenger who is unencumbered by kids.  I do understand about the seat thing, but if you check-in 24 hours in advance, you should have a better chance of getting a decent seat.", "In terms of needing to sit near someone who can assist them, yes they are", "I think it's mainly to grab cabin space in the overhead luggage compartment. Everyone wants to sit right under where their belongings are. If I have a window seat, I'd prefer boarding early as well as some people just refuse to get up once their butts are in their seats and I hate scooching past aisle and middle if they refuse to move.", "You\u2019d have to pay for your underseat luggage!  This was really designed more for 1-day business trips in my mind.  I had some of those years ago, flew out at 7am, worked from 9-5, dinner out, and back in an 8 or 9pm flight.  Saved the company putting us up in a hotel overnight - and royally sucked for the employees.\n\nEdit: autocorrected underseat to underwear!"]}
