[UPDATE]", "selftext": "\nSo, to start, I\u2019d like to thank everyone who commented on my last post. I read through as many replies as I could and some of y\u2019all had me sobbing. Genuinely, everyone says that the internet is a cesspit of toxicity, but that\u2019s not true at all. Mushy feelings aside, here\u2019s the actual update. \n\nSo, the first thing I did was talk to my stepdad. Contrary to some of y\u2019all\u2019s assumptions, I don\u2019t live at my parents\u2019s house, so I asked him over to breakfast to talk on a day my mom had work but I had off. He knows I usually plan around my mom\u2019s work schedule, so I think he knew it was serious beforehand. \n\nWe sat down over eggs and I told him what had happened. He\u2019d been doing something else at the time, and was absolutely shocked. Apparently, my mom had told him a twisted version of events. According to him, she\u2019d said that I sent her an \u201cangry text\u201d because of a \u201cfew harmless jabs\u201d and that she was \u201conly kidding\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t mean any harm\u201d. She also had conspicuously left out her drunken text to me.\n\nHis reaction to the actual content of her \u201cjokes\u201d can only be described as a deep sadness and frustration. He offered me true support and affirmation, something that I could never picture my mom doing in my a million years. My mom can be nice, but she\u2019s not great at anything deeper than platitudes. What did I ever do to deserve him? \n\nHe was also completely blindsided by the fact that there was alcohol at a kid\u2019s party. Apparently, he had left the planning to her and had no idea. \n\nI told him that I want to go very low contact with my mom for a bit, and asked for his help to see him and Melody without having to deal with her. He said that he understood, and agreed to have me over when she\u2019s not around. \n\nHe told me he would get my mom help with her emotions and her drinking problem, and I told him that she probably wouldn\u2019t cooperate and promised to help him get her the help she needs in what ways I can. \n\nA half hour after my stepdad left, I texted my mom the following:\n\n*Hey ma, I\u2019ve mulled over what happened at Mel\u2019s party and I\u2019ve come to the realization that our relationship is not healthy. You put me down for things that weren\u2019t my fault and laugh at how you and* [my bio dad] *screwed my childhood up. It hurts to hear you speak about me like that, and I don\u2019t think you understand exactly how much.*\n\n*I\u2019ve also come to the understanding that you serving alcohol at a four year old\u2019s birthday party without even telling dad isn\u2019t normal. This isn\u2019t a one time thing, you start drinking at eight AM and don\u2019t stop until bed. You have two problems, and until you get some serious help with both of them, I would like very little contact with you.*\n\n*Please don\u2019t contact me outside of an emergency.* \n\nI then blocked her from texting me \n\nI know this isn\u2019t as dramatic of an update as y\u2019all were hoping for, but I hope that someone can take something from it. I know it\u2019s only been a few days, but I have no regrets. Maybe going cold turkey off her was what I needed.", "created_utc": 1689731074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153h593/aita_for_leaving_after_my_mom_kept_joking_about/", "score": 1480, "replies": ["I hope that things get better for you because of this.", "It's hard to deal with family that we're with you in the hard times, then put you down for back then when you were a kid OP.

OP I am so glad you're in therapy and you seem to have a great handle on things.

She also said she\u2019d never wanted a daughter(I was 43 when she said this). Let me tell you- having her say out loud what I\u2019d always kind suspected was actually very freeing once I got over the hurt. Used to wonder WTH was wrong with me, but turns out- the problem was her all along. Mine is also an alcoholic, something that was more closeted but she\u2019s stopped hiding it in the last few years. We are no contact now, and it\u2019s been 3 years of discovery on my part. I\u2019m so much happier without her in my life, and I hope the same for you.", "YTA ESH", "Well done!

Life is messy and it looks like you have taken some solid steps forward. I wish you much happiness and all the best in the future.

I would even have given her the benefit of the doubt for using the term \"practice child\" self-deprecatingly, as a way of recognising her own failures when she wasn't yet capable of engaging with them fully. But the instant she started saying that it was a *good* thing she didn't do more for her \"practice child\"? She lost any trace of sympathy I had for her. You have handled this perfectly. You're not cutting off your dad or sister; you're not punishing her for the sake of it, you're just protecting yourself.

When I was 17, there was a big fight between my father and my grandmother, which ended with my grandmother literally *screaming* in his face to get the fuck out of the house. I ran to the bathroom and completely broke down. I couldn't even do it at the kitchen counter where I was trying to eat lunch because I was so used to hiding my emotions from them, but I just could not take it anymore. I'm pretty sure that was when my mother finally realized what all the fighting and yelling was doing to me because that night the three of us left to a hotel, and the next day she went to the house to tell him to pack up his shit and leave. Better late than never I guess, but I have 17 years worth of bad memories and trauma because of him. At least my mother would never use my issues as a joking matter."]}
