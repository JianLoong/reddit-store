[UPDATE]", "selftext": "\nSo, to start, I\u2019d like to thank everyone who commented on my last post. I read through as many replies as I could and some of y\u2019all had me sobbing. Genuinely, everyone says that the internet is a cesspit of toxicity, but that\u2019s not true at all. Mushy feelings aside, here\u2019s the actual update. \n\nSo, the first thing I did was talk to my stepdad. Contrary to some of y\u2019all\u2019s assumptions, I don\u2019t live at my parents\u2019s house, so I asked him over to breakfast to talk on a day my mom had work but I had off. He knows I usually plan around my mom\u2019s work schedule, so I think he knew it was serious beforehand. \n\nWe sat down over eggs and I told him what had happened. He\u2019d been doing something else at the time, and was absolutely shocked. Apparently, my mom had told him a twisted version of events. According to him, she\u2019d said that I sent her an \u201cangry text\u201d because of a \u201cfew harmless jabs\u201d and that she was \u201conly kidding\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t mean any harm\u201d. She also had conspicuously left out her drunken text to me.\n\nHis reaction to the actual content of her \u201cjokes\u201d can only be described as a deep sadness and frustration. He offered me true support and affirmation, something that I could never picture my mom doing in my a million years. My mom can be nice, but she\u2019s not great at anything deeper than platitudes. What did I ever do to deserve him? \n\nHe was also completely blindsided by the fact that there was alcohol at a kid\u2019s party. Apparently, he had left the planning to her and had no idea. \n\nI told him that I want to go very low contact with my mom for a bit, and asked for his help to see him and Melody without having to deal with her. He said that he understood, and agreed to have me over when she\u2019s not around. \n\nHe told me he would get my mom help with her emotions and her drinking problem, and I told him that she probably wouldn\u2019t cooperate and promised to help him get her the help she needs in what ways I can. \n\nA half hour after my stepdad left, I texted my mom the following:\n\n*Hey ma, I\u2019ve mulled over what happened at Mel\u2019s party and I\u2019ve come to the realization that our relationship is not healthy. You put me down for things that weren\u2019t my fault and laugh at how you and* [my bio dad] *screwed my childhood up. It hurts to hear you speak about me like that, and I don\u2019t think you understand exactly how much.*\n\n*I\u2019ve also come to the understanding that you serving alcohol at a four year old\u2019s birthday party without even telling dad isn\u2019t normal. This isn\u2019t a one time thing, you start drinking at eight AM and don\u2019t stop until bed. You have two problems, and until you get some serious help with both of them, I would like very little contact with you.*\n\n*Please don\u2019t contact me outside of an emergency.* \n\nI then blocked her from texting me \n\nI know this isn\u2019t as dramatic of an update as y\u2019all were hoping for, but I hope that someone can take something from it. I know it\u2019s only been a few days, but I have no regrets.

I'd only have one teeny suggestion:\n\n>  I would like very little contact with you.\n\nI know how hard it is to shake off the 'parent/child' relationship with all that entails, but you need to learn how to not ask for what you need, but assert what you need.  \"I will be going out of contact with you.\"\n\n> Please don\u2019t contact me outside of an emergency.\n\nI also understand the thinking behind this, but leaving that door open just a crack lets her start whaling on it with an emotional crowbar.  If she has a genuine emergency, she should be calling 911.\n\nStay the course, mate.  Go look up the Bill of Assertive Rights, and see if any of it resonates with you.  If it does, read 'When I Say No, I Feel Guilty' and learn the ways of avoiding manipulation.", "Not as 'dramatic' but a nice resolve. as for step dad-listen to brad Paisley's \"Didn't have to be.\" I can't hear it without thinking of my step dad and tearing up a little.", "You have an amazing stepdad. I'm happy you have an adult who will support you. I love love love that he is going to make sure you can still spend time with your sister. It says a lot about your mom that she would lie to her own husband. \n\nYour text was perfect. I really hope she does get help, not only for you but your sister as well. If she doesn't, you still know you have a stepdad who loves. You are also an amazing role model for your little sister. \n\nGood luck with everything. You are an amazing young woman.", "You are stronger at 19 than I am at 32. Good for you for standing up for yourself, OP. And good on your stepdad for being such an upstanding person. I hope your mom does get the help she needs.", "Here is to hoping.", "This update will need further updates.", "Big hugs to you, dear OP. You are way more mature than most adults that I know, and you dealt with this really beautifully. Your stepdad is also an awesome person. I hope this is the starting point of a healing process and a very happy life for you. Big hugs.", "My heart hurts for the younger you who collected coins to give to his parents to stop fighting. You did not deserve that then and you don't deserve to be ridiculed for it now. I hope your mom takes a good, long look in the mirror.", "You made a good decision OP.", "Hey just a quick thought:\nif your dad does manage to get your mum to get help for her alcoholism, please try to do so with the help of a trained addiction specialist & her PCP. \n\nGoing cold-turkey from alcoholism is not safe & can result in severe neurological impairment. I've taken care of someone who tried to quit cold-turkey and was found in a pool of vomit after a massive seizure. This person became mentally and physically disabled as a result & needed full-time care. \n\nAA groups aren't really a thing where I live, but I've heard they can be problematic, so never rely solely on them for support. \n\nI wish you all well.", "Hiw can she contact you in case of an emergency if she's blocked? Let's just say i know very well what you're going through and you did a good job.\n\nHowever don't block her. Only if she steps over the line after your last text.\n\nGood luck on your road", "No u good", "Yay", "NTA. Your mother has a disease and it impacts her thinking and behavior. I suggest reading the book, \"Co-Dependent No More\" by Melody Beattie and find some groups for Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOA). [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) is a great place to start for finding support groups.  My mother died of end stage liver disease due to alcoholism in 2015. I lived my whole life experienced similar situations that you described. Its tough, but you can get past this. Setting boundaries is a great first step. Good luck OP.", "I'm so glad your step-dad is there for you. You deserve to have someone by your side that genuinely cares about. Good job on LC with your mom.", "I\u2019m proud of you.", "It's shocking to me that people can wait so long to do something about parents.", "You're doing absolutely amazing dear.", "Maybe. We're a little confused about why he apparently wasn't at his own daughter's birthday party. Or maybe there, but oblivious to the fact that his wife was trashed.", "I'm so proud of you op. It takes guts to stand up to a parental figure when they are being abusive. Keep your head up op, you're doing the right thing.", "Here is to hoping.", "Okay, I'm confused. Why wasn't this guy at his own daughter's birthday party? How did not know about the alcohol and your mom's drunkenness?", "His focus was probably where OP's egg donor's SHOULD have been. On the birthday girl.", "I hope it helps your mental health and stress levels.\n\nThanks for the update.", "my 20 year old niece is like this with her mom.  I read some of the texts she sends her mom and Im like \"damn, she has a far more mature take on this than I would at her age\".  \n\nPretty sure its a  side effect of having shitty parents and having to grow up quick.", "To the point that he didn't even know alcohol was being served?", "> I would place bets that the reason you were a 'hellion', to quote yourself, was because you had such a difficult mother. I don't think that is your true self.", "You've done the right thing throughout all of this--well done. Hopefully your mother can get the help she needs, but right now, focus on your own healing.", "It sounds like the alcohol was in a completely seperate part of the house/yard. Watching a 4 year old can be very distracting."]}
