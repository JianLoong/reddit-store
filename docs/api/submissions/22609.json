[UPDATE]", "selftext": "\nSo, to start, I\u2019d like to thank everyone who commented on my last post. I read through as many replies as I could and some of y\u2019all had me sobbing. Genuinely, everyone says that the internet is a cesspit of toxicity, but that\u2019s not true at all. Mushy feelings aside, here\u2019s the actual update. \n\nSo, the first thing I did was talk to my stepdad. Contrary to some of y\u2019all\u2019s assumptions, I don\u2019t live at my parents\u2019s house, so I asked him over to breakfast to talk on a day my mom had work but I had off. He knows I usually plan around my mom\u2019s work schedule, so I think he knew it was serious beforehand. \n\nWe sat down over eggs and I told him what had happened. He\u2019d been doing something else at the time, and was absolutely shocked. Apparently, my mom had told him a twisted version of events. According to him, she\u2019d said that I sent her an \u201cangry text\u201d because of a \u201cfew harmless jabs\u201d and that she was \u201conly kidding\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t mean any harm\u201d. She also had conspicuously left out her drunken text to me.\n\nHis reaction to the actual content of her \u201cjokes\u201d can only be described as a deep sadness and frustration. He offered me true support and affirmation, something that I could never picture my mom doing in my a million years. My mom can be nice, but she\u2019s not great at anything deeper than platitudes. What did I ever do to deserve him? \n\nHe was also completely blindsided by the fact that there was alcohol at a kid\u2019s party. Apparently, he had left the planning to her and had no idea. \n\nI told him that I want to go very low contact with my mom for a bit, and asked for his help to see him and Melody without having to deal with her. He said that he understood, and agreed to have me over when she\u2019s not around. \n\nHe told me he would get my mom help with her emotions and her drinking problem, and I told him that she probably wouldn\u2019t cooperate and promised to help him get her the help she needs in what ways I can. \n\nA half hour after my stepdad left, I texted my mom the following:\n\n*Hey ma, I\u2019ve mulled over what happened at Mel\u2019s party and I\u2019ve come to the realization that our relationship is not healthy. You put me down for things that weren\u2019t my fault and laugh at how you and* [my bio dad] *screwed my childhood up. It hurts to hear you speak about me like that, and I don\u2019t think you understand exactly how much.*\n\n*I\u2019ve also come to the understanding that you serving alcohol at a four year old\u2019s birthday party without even telling dad isn\u2019t normal. This isn\u2019t a one time thing, you start drinking at eight AM and don\u2019t stop until bed. You have two problems, and until you get some serious help with both of them, I would like very little contact with you.*\n\n*Please don\u2019t contact me outside of an emergency.* \n\nI then blocked her from texting me \n\nI know this isn\u2019t as dramatic of an update as y\u2019all were hoping for, but I hope that someone can take something from it. I know it\u2019s only been a few days, but I have no regrets. Maybe going cold turkey off her was what I needed.", "created_utc": 1689731074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153h593/aita_for_leaving_after_my_mom_kept_joking_about/", "score": 591, "replies": ["I hope that things get better for you because of this.", "It's hard to deal with family that we're with you in the hard times, then put you down for back then when you were a kid OP.

I didn't see the original, and reading it now: the story about little you collecting those coins hurts my heart. \n\nMy mother is a piece of work, but at worst she'd tell stories like that to get sympathy for feeling bad about it. Which is a step up from thinking it's funny!\n\nYou're doing amazingly. Good luck.", "You've done the right thing throughout all of this--well done.

Good luck man, we\u2019re all rooting for you!", "I\u2019m proud of you.", "Your stepfather is a good man and by your description he loves the mess outta you. In today\u2019s world that\u2019s very far few and between. As for your mother, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re giving her consequences for her actions and until she decides to show by her actions that she wants to get better what you can kind of see if she\u2019s not. You\u2019ll have nothing to do with her and quite frankly that\u2019s the best course of action and I love how your dad is willing to work with you. So you can still see your sister, kudos to him and you.", "Your step dad is a a wonderful person.  You are lucky to have him your life.\n\nYour text was not offensive.

I wish you everything good in life!", "After my ex and I separated, I had several heated phone conversations with him before we started the divorce. The last time it happened, I noticed my 5 yo daughter run from the room. She hid in the closet because she didn't want to hear us yelling anymore. When I found her, she told me that when daddy left she hoped she didn't ever have to hear me sad or yelling again. It broke me, and I have always taken that to heart. I am so ashamed of what she went through, and I made sure she never went through it again. It is never a story I would share for it's comedy gold.\n\nI am so grateful that you have your wonderful step father,  trusted therapist and a hopeful path ahead.", "I am a recovering alcoholic and I cry when I think of the drunken comments-the drunken texts. Ive apologize so much to my kids. And I try everyday to be a good mother. I\u2019m sorry you had to experience that.

OP I am so glad you're in therapy and you seem to have a great handle on things. I started therapy at 22 (when I could afford to pay for it myself, my mother refused to take me before that) and learned a lot about myself and how not-normal my childhood was.  My mom had a lot of comments about my youth that made me realise how little she really understood about me, and moving away from her and the extended family was the best thing I ever did.", "The maturity and manner in which you were able to communicate and handle your feelings to your mother and stepfather is genuinely admirable. \n\nIt's great to hear that you're in a better place now, you should be proud of yourself and how far you've come. You sound like a wonderful individual. May you continue to grow and heal and have a life full of love and joy. You deserve nothing less <3", "I'm really glad you're here. Please stick around, Buddy, and continue to get the help you need and deserve."]}
