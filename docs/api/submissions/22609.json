[UPDATE]", "selftext": "\nSo, to start, I\u2019d like to thank everyone who commented on my last post. I read through as many replies as I could and some of y\u2019all had me sobbing. Genuinely, everyone says that the internet is a cesspit of toxicity, but that\u2019s not true at all. Mushy feelings aside, here\u2019s the actual update. \n\nSo, the first thing I did was talk to my stepdad. Contrary to some of y\u2019all\u2019s assumptions, I don\u2019t live at my parents\u2019s house, so I asked him over to breakfast to talk on a day my mom had work but I had off. He knows I usually plan around my mom\u2019s work schedule, so I think he knew it was serious beforehand. \n\nWe sat down over eggs and I told him what had happened. He\u2019d been doing something else at the time, and was absolutely shocked. Apparently, my mom had told him a twisted version of events. According to him, she\u2019d said that I sent her an \u201cangry text\u201d because of a \u201cfew harmless jabs\u201d and that she was \u201conly kidding\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t mean any harm\u201d. She also had conspicuously left out her drunken text to me.\n\nHis reaction to the actual content of her \u201cjokes\u201d can only be described as a deep sadness and frustration. He offered me true support and affirmation, something that I could never picture my mom doing in my a million years. My mom can be nice, but she\u2019s not great at anything deeper than platitudes. What did I ever do to deserve him? \n\nHe was also completely blindsided by the fact that there was alcohol at a kid\u2019s party. Apparently, he had left the planning to her and had no idea. \n\nI told him that I want to go very low contact with my mom for a bit, and asked for his help to see him and Melody without having to deal with her. He said that he understood, and agreed to have me over when she\u2019s not around. \n\nHe told me he would get my mom help with her emotions and her drinking problem, and I told him that she probably wouldn\u2019t cooperate and promised to help him get her the help she needs in what ways I can. \n\nA half hour after my stepdad left, I texted my mom the following:\n\n*Hey ma, I\u2019ve mulled over what happened at Mel\u2019s party and I\u2019ve come to the realization that our relationship is not healthy. You put me down for things that weren\u2019t my fault and laugh at how you and* [my bio dad] *screwed my childhood up. It hurts to hear you speak about me like that, and I don\u2019t think you understand exactly how much.*\n\n*I\u2019ve also come to the understanding that you serving alcohol at a four year old\u2019s birthday party without even telling dad isn\u2019t normal. This isn\u2019t a one time thing, you start drinking at eight AM and don\u2019t stop until bed. You have two problems, and until you get some serious help with both of them, I would like very little contact with you.*\n\n*Please don\u2019t contact me outside of an emergency.* \n\nI then blocked her from texting me \n\nI know this isn\u2019t as dramatic of an update as y\u2019all were hoping for, but I hope that someone can take something from it. I know it\u2019s only been a few days, but I have no regrets.

I'd only have one teeny suggestion:\n\n>  I would like very little contact with you.\n\nI know how hard it is to shake off the 'parent/child' relationship with all that entails, but you need to learn how to not ask for what you need, but assert what you need.  \"I will be going out of contact with you.\"\n\n> Please don\u2019t contact me outside of an emergency.\n\nI also understand the thinking behind this, but leaving that door open just a crack lets her start whaling on it with an emotional crowbar.  If she has a genuine emergency, she should be calling 911.\n\nStay the course, mate.  Go look up the Bill of Assertive Rights, and see if any of it resonates with you.  If it does, read 'When I Say No, I Feel Guilty' and learn the ways of avoiding manipulation.", "Not as 'dramatic' but a nice resolve. as for step dad-listen to brad Paisley's \"Didn't have to be.\" I can't hear it without thinking of my step dad and tearing up a little.", "You have an amazing stepdad.

You should be really proud that you stood up for yourself, and prioritized your mental health. Not a lot of people can do the same. So many people will say, \"they are our parents so we have to have a relationship with them\"... Or after hearing that someone went no contact after decades of abuse, \"Don't burn that bridge just yet, you may regret it because they are your parents\". Our parents deserve to be treated just as any other relationship in our lives, especially if they were abusive and/or neglectful during our childhood. We did not choose for them to bring us into this world, they did. And if they couldn't have the decency to give is the basic care, affection, and stability that we deserved as children we don't owe them anything as adults. They should feel lucky to have a relationship with us at all if we choose to. So as with anyone else they need to treat us with respect and value our time and energy. If they can't do that, than they don't need to be a part of our lives... period.

A dark spot that existed only to destroy and consume that the world would be better off without. Yeah it was a very self centered and self destructive mentality, and on top of all that I thought therapy was for losers and medication was for addicts.

Lots of us grew up poor, wore hand me downs, had a frugal childhood but it didn\u2019t have to be unhappy. We didn\u2019t get family holidays abroad but we went camping in the summer for example. You were denied basic care as a child, it\u2019s a cold hard truth and your mum is telling these stories because she thinks in that sort of context she would have others laugh along and receive validation for actions that she still questions herself for. She didn\u2019t get it of course. You are doing the best thing for you, that is the right thing to do. Put yourself first because you cannot trust her to do it. I am so glad to hear that your step father is supporting you in this. \nJust as a side note let me tell you that most teens become hellions at some point even without the emotional trauma that you went through. I did a lot of things and pushed a lot of buttons and a parent should try to guide you through this time and help you. Having a rebellious period in your life doesn\u2019t make you a bad person.

Be proud that you are breaking the cycle and not perpetuating the standards you were exposed to as a child. That is all you and your own inner strength. They say that life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it and you are shining in your example of reacting in the right way.
