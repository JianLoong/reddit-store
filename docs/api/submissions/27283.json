We like to go on walks on a daily basis. Our neighbor down the block has a moderately large sized dog. \n\nSeveral months back, we were walking by and I had our 2-YO in a wagon. I didn't initially see the dog hanging out by the house, but once it saw us, it ran up to us rather fast and aggressively. The dog did not appear as if it intended to attack or bite us, but even if it was being friendly, the loud barks and fast run made it unclear what the dog's intentions were. Subsequently, the owner yelled \"oh he is harmless\" and then called the dog back to her. \n\nI was frustrated that the owner did not offer a at least an apology since I was slightly shaken from having to react so quickly, but I continued walking and moved on. \n\nSince that time, I have been keeping a watchful eye in case the dog was hanging out again. Then just recently, a similar incident. We were walking by and, this time, I saw the owner at the door (didn't realize they were coming out until I was near their house), but suddenly the dog bolted through the door and toward us. It came at us so fast that I both lifted her and my then lifted my leg in a defensive position. \n\nOnce again, the owner called the dog back. This time, I said that they should really be more aware with a toddler walking by and keep their dog on a leash or in control. They once again did not apologize but continued to argue that it was a friendly dog. I tried to explain that I don't know that when a dog is aggressively coming up to me (edit: meant to add \"whether or not they are aggressive\") and they seemed more annoyed at me for taking a defensive stance rather than apologetic for scaring me and my toddler.\n\nAITA for being frustrated at them and taking issue with this? I understand that people want to have their dogs run around in their yard, but I feel that many in our community in general have gotten too lax with letting their dogs run around.

If your dog is leaving your property (or running to the edge of an unfenced property line) to rush people, it doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re friendly.  That\u2019s the sort of thing that can be quite scary and can easily cause injuries, potentially serious ones.  When I had my service dog (he passed almost 3 years ago), that sort of thing could easily cause me to get knocked over as my dog reacted to being rushed.  As my disability makes me rather fragile, it would likely mean a trip to the ER, possibly in an ambulance.  I\u2019m sure your neighborhood has disabled or elderly people who would be facing similar risks.\n\nI love dogs, have had them all my life, and I still find being rushed by dogs I don\u2019t know well unsettling at best.  Even with dogs I do know well, it makes me nervous because getting knocked over hurts!  They either need a sturdy fence or they need to manage their dog.", "NTA, a dog running at you weather it\u2019s friendly or not is stressful. Dog owners need to understand not everyone loves dogs and wants them running up to them and jumping on them etc.", "NTA\u2014you cannot predict the actions of animals, even friendly ones. I have personally witness the sweetest dog in the world bite a kid not out of malice but because the dog was over excited and just wanted to play. No claim of \u201charmless\u201d has ever been a good substitute for a leash. \n\nAs much as I hate my own suggestion, this is something to bring up to the local authorities. If a dog is running around with a leash in an unfenced yard, that is a hazard that puts your kid and you in danger. You\u2019ve tried being reasonable with the neighbors and they have dismissed you. \n\nTime to make them listen.", "NTA, but do make sure to invest in humane dog pepper spray and tell you neighbors if you feel threatened, you'll use it. Their dog may be friendly to them but it doesn't mean it's friendly to random people.  \nHey, I'm a dog owner, I carry a spray all the time. Can't count how many times dogs would run up to me and my dog with unclear intentions. I make sure to tell people I won't hesitate to use spray in self defense and next time they see me - they leash their dog\ud83e\udd14\n\n\nAlso, there are jnvisible fence systems in the market and if they want their dog to run around but can't control it, they need to get one of those.", "NTA. A dog should either be on a leash or in a fenced in backyard. If their dog is liable to run past them out the door, they need to be aware and make sure their dog doesn't run outside.", "Nope NTA\n\ndepending on where you live, there may be a leash law. And a dog that can dash off their property, because its unleashed is a potential danger.\n\nYou read and hear of so many incidences with 'friendly' dogs who maul babies or bite adults who are walking by their home. Its a natural instinct for dogs to protect their owners and property.\n\nIf the owner wont take steps to keep his dog contained, then contact the city animal control authority and tell them of the incidences, and ask what recourse you have.", "NTA, and this is coming from a dog person.  Regardless of how friendly the owner says the dog is, it is their responsibility to be in control of the dog, whether that be by having the dog fenced in or on leash.  I would assume it is likely there are laws in your town that state that as well.  Not sure I'd call the cops on them or anything, but I would definitely check in to the law so you are prepared should anything ever get out of hand.", "NTA. Dog people seem to think everyone loves their dog, even if it is clearly out of control, which this one is by definition. It's ancient parental instinct to protect our babies, so responded exactly a a parent should.", "NTA. Dog should be leashed.", "I used to go for runs around my neighborhood.  Ran by this one house many times.  One day, I was on the other side of the street even, and the dog started barking and charging, didnt even stop at its property line and came right at me.  I did what you did, and lifted my leg in defense.  Damn dog ran right around it, jumped up and bit me on the back of the thigh.  I spoke to the owner who said, thats so weird, hes so friendly and has never bitten.  No idea what laws are in your area.  And you shouldnt have to, but maybe walk a different route out of caution.  NTA", "You should go to the neighbors without your kid in tow and ask if they can get a long lead/dog run for when they let them out on their property. \n\nWe have a 25ft run attached to the pillar of the porch for this reason alone. My dog has never bolted or charged the passersby, but why risk it? NTA, if they become confrontational you should avoid that direction for safety.", "I love dogs but was attacked by one once and severely bitten. I freak out when one runs towards me.  If I were you, I\u2019d carry pepper spray and inform the owner next time his dog charges at you, you will use it.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nDogs should not be able to leave their house/garden unsupervised. Ever. No matter how friendly they are.", "NTA If dogs go off property, they should be on a leash.  If the dog never left their property, that's another matter.", "It doesn't matter if the owner has a dog that they believe is friendly or harmless. There are dogs out there that would maim or kill their friendly dog if provoked. There are people that have experienced trauma with dogs...there are people that are allergic to pets. Most importantly, strangers do not have trust in unfamiliar animals, especially ones that approach rapidly. People that don't leash their dogs outside of the confines of their homes or fenced yards are ignorant, self-centered and generally bad people.", "NTA - as a dog owner and a dog lover that person is irresponsible. \n\nI never let my dogs run without me being right there to control them. Although my golden retriever knew how to open the gate and would take himself on walks. Drove me nuts trying to keep him in the yard. \n\nNow that being said, I would avoid walking by that house. It's obvious the owner is not going to control their dog and you can't really force them to. The best option going forward is walk down a different street.", "It is the responsibility of a pet owner not only to ensure the physical safety of others from incidents their pet may cause, but make sure they feel safe as well, by having adequate protections in place, like a leash, or a fence set back from the sidewalk a bit, since some dogs can bite above a fence. NTA", "NTA if their dog is running at people who walk by on the sidewalk, then it is not under their control and it should be on a lead restraint of some sort. I don't give a shit if they think their dog is friendly or not, if it runs at my toddler I am going to kick it first and then yell at the owner A LOT.", "NTA and your neighbor is a bad pet owner to allow her dog to rush you like that. That's how dogs and people get hurt. Can you walk on the other side of the street? Alternately, if you give the dog a loud, stern \"NO! NO! BAD DOG!\" it may be less inclined to come say hi. And the owner will be FURIOUS that you dared to discipline her dog, maybe just enough to not let him near you again.", "I hate this type of stuff. Moving to the west coast from NY I am absolutely flabbergasted at how folks think their dogs are/should be seen as angels running around. In the mile or so walk to school there are two giant black labs and a Doberman that I have never seen be on leash", "NTA. They need to control their dog or someone's going to shoot it.", "Why should they be more aware of toddlers when you're not aware of a dog's home?  You've passed by there before and know where it lives and you know it is somewhat intimidating, so why do you walk that route?  They have no responsibility to watch out for you, especially when they are able to recall their dog.  It's their yard...you stay away.  YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The owner needs to be responsible, no matter how friendly the dog is.", "NTA. As a mom with 3 under 5 I understand why this stresses you out. I LOVE DOGS, but I don\u2019t want one running at my kids. You need to tell the neighbor to please keep their dog on a tether so it cannot exit their yard.

Literally just went through this. It's incredibly frustrating. I was walking my dogs, dog runs up. Doesn't matter if they're friendly. Lots of dogs are friendly until they're not. People need to keep control of their animals.", "NTA.  Owner of 6 very friendly dogs here.  Never will I ever let them out of the house without a leash, or let them approach anyone (adult or child) without first having them sit and letting the person pet them.   Anyone who doesn\u2019t do this is a negligent dog owner.  You could have the friendliest dog in the world but something could scare them one day.  It puts your dog and strangers at risk.  They\u2019re totally the asshole and they need to learn dog owner etiquette.", "NTA.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the dog is charging at you in a friendly or aggressive way. You have a toddler on a paved walkway. A medium-large dog with that much momentum and energy could send your toddler flying just by accident, and on concrete/paving/tarmac that could cause injuries.\n\nThe dog is clearly not trained well enough or under control enough to be outside unrestrained. For such a small person, a big boisterous friendly dog can be just as dangerous as an aggressive one. The owner is clearly both clueless and reckless about her dog's strength and power.\n\nEven more importantly than that, the movements, behaviour and reactions of both dogs and toddlers can be unpredictable, which is why good dog owners are always watchful around children, even if they don't have children themselves. A good dog can still lash out instinctively if a toddler catches them by surprise, especially if they're not properly trained and experienced.\n\nAs a child-free dog lover who has little personal interest in kids, even I don't trust a dog around a baby or small child. The potential for unpredictable accidental conflict is far to high for the safety of both the child and the dog to be put at risk.", "NTA.
