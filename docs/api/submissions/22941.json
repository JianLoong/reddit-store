It's unreasonable of her to expect you to go away from your home or hide in bedroom.  This is your home also and she's being selfish.\n\nWhy can't she meet the girls somewhere?  Why can't any of the other girls host a get together?  You know, take turns so it becomes 'occasionally?\"", "NTA. Lol. Having to leave your own home?\n\nMaybe there are circumstances where this would be appropriate. I cant think of any. Especially not as a regular thing.\n\nThe problem with you leaving for a while is that you live there. Presumably you pay the rent. You shouldnt have to leave. Your gf is being wildly unreasonable. Why dont they all go out?\n\nThe correct response to her is 'Lol no'.", "I should start having bro evenings at your appartment", "NTA.. it's your space too, and her asking you to leave almost every sunday sounds tiring. Can't she spend some sundays over at her friends' places instead?", "NTA. \n\n>Most Sundays she will invite some of her friends over\n\nThis is unreasonable. They can meet in someone else's home or at a restaurant.", "She and her girls need to share hosting Sunday lunch. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou have just as much right to be there.

Asking you to do that once a week is unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nShe is not wrong to want alone time with her friends. She is wrong to want to kick you out of your shared house 'most Sundays'. If you work full time then you only have two days off a week and she's expecting you to be gone (out of the house or confined to the bedroom) for half of your days off? That is unreasonable.\n\nWhy is she hosting all the time? Can't they rotate so that it's only once every 4-6 weeks or so depending on the size of the friend group? Can't they go to a lunch room or have a picnic at a park? She is being really unreasonable. I'd die on this hill. You live there too. If she isn't willing to change this, tell her she needs to be out of the house or confined to the bedroom most Saturdays from 11-15h because your mates are coming over to watch the game and she isn't welcome to join.", "It\u2019s like there\u2019s no where else in the world they can meet hmmmm \ud83e\udd14 NTA", "NTA\n\nThis requires compromise.\n\nIt's not unreasonable for her to request some free time in the house without you there.. but as long as you can have the same courtesy.  Maybe one Sunday a month is her day, and one Sunday a month is your day and you still have two Sundays you can hang out together.\n\nHer getting most Sunday's is not okay.\n\nAnother option may be finding a Sunday hobby that gets you out of the house and she can do whatever she wants while you are out... but I'm not sure how that will go down with her (because then she'll complain she isn't seeing enough of you).\n\nYour issue is going to be if she is unyielding about a compromise and throws a tantrum (or even just stamps her feet).  This would be a red flag.  Because if she won't compromise on this, what will she not compromise on next.  You may have to reevaluate the relationship if you do see some red flags that weren't apparently early if she refuses to consider that there may be a problem.\n\nYou likely aren't perfect... so she may have some things to say too.", "NTA", "NAH\nIt's totally reasonable to want privacy in your own home, as your girlfriend does when she has friends over and asks you to leave.\n\nIt\u2019s also totally reasonable to not want to leave your house every Sunday. \n\nThat sounds like it.

To be honest, it just sounds like they're both kind of inexperienced and stubborn. I believe a lot more context is needed to call this a red flag."]}
