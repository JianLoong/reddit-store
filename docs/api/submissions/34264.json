He's very loving and supportive except one annoying habit of his that has hurt me over and over again.\n\nEverytime he gets drunk he usually calls all his friends but I noticed he even calls some women, and they aren't like his best friends or good friends which I think I'd still be ok with. All of these calls are at night, and never in front of me. I once fought with him because he'd call one friend only when he was drunk and always late at night. We once had a huge fight because I saw messages in his phone when an ex colleague he occasionally talks to sent messages asking him to stop calling as she couldn't speak at the moment. It led to the biggest fight in our marriage and I asked him to block her. I thought he did, until two days ago when he was drinking he was calling his friends in the evening. At night he locked the door from inside while making a call suddenly and my instincts took over. He had called the same woman I had asked him to block. He hung up after I knocked the door and asked for his phone. I lost my mind and called her right then and she also said she didn't understand why he drunk calls her. She later texted me saying he drunk calls her two to three times in a year, also assuring me that he never crossed any line in conversations. \n\nAll these calls are not flirtatious but I am extremely upset by this behaviour. I know if a married man called me drunk late at night I'd definitely judge him while also pitying his wife. I haven't spoken to him since then for two reasons. 1. He didn't just not block her, after our huge fight years ago he continued to call her. 2. The fact that he finds the need to drunk call women and doesn't understand how hurtful it is to me.\n\nSometimes I wonder if he's rebeling because I ask him not to do certain things, or does he simply not understand some boundaries.

Had no partner at the time, and there was no rhyme or reason to it - men, women, I probably would have called my sisters dog if it had a phone. The topics were usually bizzare, but never remotely sexual. \n\nFrom my experience, only people who have never dealt with addiction can think that drunk behaviour is always indicative of character or secret longings (while it can be for some). I had nothing to gain by telling my work buddy at 3:00 am how much i was enjoying my A/C, but at one point alcohol made me do that :-)\n\nThat being said, the real problem here is your husband drinking too much.

He's clearly ignoring a set boundary, and while people do have a right to self-determination and having friendships as they please, that doesn't mean those friendships come without consequence. It would appear that he values his friendship with this woman and his drunken interactions with other women more than he values your relationship and happiness.  \n\n\nI'm not going to call for the Whole Men Disposal Services just yet, but I would suggest you both find a time to have a serious, sober conversation or three about this situation and make it clear how much it hurts you and your relationship.", "NTA \n\nThis isn\u2019t just some \u2018annoying habit\u2019 though.

This is not appropriate behavior.", "NTA.  You have a 36 year old that rebels?  He needs to grow up.  That is RIDICULOUS behavior.  I don't know if he has a drinking problem, but I agree, he has another issue.  I think you might need more help than just communication, as he doesn't seem to listen.  I don't know what he is doing in the calls, but that is problematic.", "NTA - the calling other women part isn\u2019t the biggest problem for me, it\u2019s the lying to you about blocking certain women and not doing it.", "NTA he is basically harassing these women", "NTA but he needs to go to counseling. He needs help and is probably an alcoholic.", "NTA. You and I are close in age. I am a woman and my partner, who is a man, gets drunk dialed by a high school friend, who is also a woman. I am not threatened by the woman's behavior, and both my partner and I find it really sad.

Either he\u2019s cheating/wants to cheat, or he\u2019s not, you making him block one woman isn\u2019t going to change that.

I doubt his friends appreciate his drunk calls. You can check his call logs online to see how often he\u2019s actually calling and texting other women, but I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned if he has such an out of control issue with drunk calling everyone.", "NTA. Your husband mosty certainly is one, i'd block him.\n\nOn a side note, forcing him to block someone isn't really helpful. If he understands why his actions are hurting you, he won't do it again. You shouldn't have to force anything. He either understands, or he doesn't and probably never will.", "NTA. Your husband needs help. If he can\u2019t control himself when he\u2019s drinking, he needs to stop drinking. Period. If he CAN control himself while he\u2019s drinking, then he\u2019s just using it as an excuse to ignore boundaries. \n\nSeems there\u2019s a deeper problem, possibly with your relationship, that is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade.", "NTA. It's completely reasonable for you to feel hurt and upset by your husband's behavior. The fact that he continues to call specific women, especially after you've expressed your discomfort and had previous fights about it, is a valid cause for concern.  \nWhile his actions may not be explicitly flirtatious, they are certainly crossing emotional boundaries. Your husband should respect your feelings and concerns and sorry but HITA.", "NTA if he gets to this point and hasn't even considered stopping drinking, then he has bigger problems than drunk-dialling women (which is already horrible in itself)", "NTA and his behavior would be a deal breaker for me.  He is an adult.  He shouldn't have to be given boundaries to do the right thing.  For God's sake he is 36 years old.  It sounds like he abuses alcohol, that is not a mature adult behavior.  He cannot or will not control his behavior when drinking.  I would rethink this relationship.  The only reason things haven't escalated is the women he is calling are turned off by his drunk calling.", "It always starts with we have a wonderful loving relationship. No you don\u2019t. Your husband is an alcoholic and he needs help. You making excuses that he calls people when he\u2019s drunk is weird.", "NTA. Whatever his intent, he is ignoring a boundary that you set within your marriage and, it sounds like, the boundaries of those he calls. \n\nIt sounds like he's in the wrong, but it also sounds like he might need some therapy and/or alcohol treatment.\n\nBest of luck, OP, that sounds difficult and painful.", ">AITA for being annoyed with husband drunk calling women late at night?\n\n>My husband and I (36 M and 34F) have a wonderful relationship.", "u def not overreacting. husband needs 2 lern some boundaries, man! drunk coldin girls is sus af. make him undrstand ur feelins and tht shit aint coo yo", "Yes, that is messed up. It sounds like he has a problem with alcohol not being compatible for him. When people have that light switch tendency when they drink it can go bad quickly. I\u2019ve dated someone like this when I was younger.", "NTA. I would tentatively believe the woman who said he\u2019s never crossed any lines but doesn\u2019t know why he drunk calls her. She wouldn\u2019t talk to you if something was really going on. Men can be friends with women without it being romantic/sexual.\n\nBut it\u2019s real simple. It bothers you. He didn\u2019t stop when asked to. That\u2019s it. He either needs to stop drinking or control himself. It\u2019s also really, really clear that he knows he\u2019s doing something wrong considering he hides it and even locks the door.", "ur definitely not the ass, ur husband is being a dumbfuk and u have every right to be mad. tell him straight up that this shit ain't cool and if he wants to keep his marriage intact he better stop drunk calling randos at night. also maybe consider couples therapy or something cuz it sounds like there might be some bigger issues going on here \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Unfortunately too much alcohol brings out a persons true character in most cases.

So in my opinion, you win this argument by default.", "The real problem here is your husband's drinking. Drunks are notorious for not respecting boundaries!", "Your husband has an alcohol problem.  My sister does this, bothers all of our relatives all over the country who ask her over and over to stop.\n\nNTA but please understand this is not about the calling, it's about the drinking.", "Bingo that\u2019s the answer right there. I never understood drunk calling/texting", "If sober husband told his wife he deleted the number, then he sucks for lying. Otherwise I agree with your take.", "Also, women are conditioned to be more polite and empathetic, so he may mostly call women friends because they\u2019ll put up with his rambling long and says comforting things compared to a male friend. I agree, he has a drinking problem but if he\u2019s otherwise a good partner there are various steps to take before throwing out baby and bath water", "I think another red flag is that this woman doesn't want to be drunk dialed, either, and he's willing to completely disrespect her boundaries as well in order to keep doing it. This man doesn't respect women at all.", "Exactly, he hasn't cheated because the women are disgusted by his drunk calls from a married man.  If they encouraged it he would cheat.  He is just looking for someone to think this behavior is ok.", "Man, if I had a friend who repeatedly drunk called me I\u2019d block them and only talk through email or in person.  Ew.  That\u2019s so annoying.  I wouldn\u2019t put up with that at age 20, much less mid-thirties."]}
