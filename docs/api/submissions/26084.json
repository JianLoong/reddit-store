Generally, we\u2018re in a very happy relationship and we barely ever disagree on important matters, meaning that in those two years, I can\u2018t remember even one significant fight.\n\nThat was until a few days ago. I barely even remember what it was that we were arguing about, but it escalated and at one point, we were both speaking with raised voices, not quite screaming but close enough.\n\nThe one thing I remember very clearly is how he told me to \"get out before he did something he\u2018d regret\". I don\u2018t think he was genuinely going to hurt me, but in that moment, those words did something to me and I just grabbed my phone and took off.\n\nI called my best friend Daisy (26F), who was kind enough to come pick me up and took me to her flat. \nShe told me that maybe spending the night away from each other wasn\u2018t the worst idea to give both of us time to think about what had happened and advised me to not make any decisions in the heat of the moment. \n\nI texted Liam to please not worry, that I was safe with Daisy and would be spending the night at her\u2018s. I asked him to please give me some time to think, but said that I\u2018d be ready to talk the next day and that I loved him. \nI turned off my phone without waiting for an answer and the rest of the night was relatively uneventful with me nodding off on the couch at some point.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up and turned on my phone to be faced with missed calls and messages from Liam, his best friend (29M) and his brother (26M).\n\nApparently after my message, he had taken off after me and had run a red light, resulting him to collide with another car. Luckily, both my boyfriend and the other driver got away with concussions and a few bruises.\n\nAfter I had read those messages, Daisy took me to the hospital and I went to check on Liam who was doing alright considering the circumstances. We had a bit of (admittedly tense) smalltalk and then, seemingly out of the blue, he told me that none of this would\u2018ve happened if I had just acted like an adult. Let\u2018s say our conversation didn\u2019t get less tense from this point on.\n\nDaisy tried to tell me that it wasn\u2018t my fault as I couldn\u2019t have known he was going to follow me, and Liam\u2019s brother agreed with her and tried to console me.\nIt\u2018s my boyfriend and his best friend who have been telling me that \"running away\" was an AH move and that I was immature for turning off my phone and \"blocking him out\", causing him to go after me and get into the accident.\n\nedit: spelling", "created_utc": 1693665905, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1684bqr/aita_for_not_immediately_visiting_my_boyfriend_in/", "score": 839, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He tells you to get out and threatens you. You, being an adult, leave for a safe space. Inform him of where you are and that you are safe and need space. He then proceeds to chase you down, driving so recklessly he wrecks and then blames you? I doubt he was chasing you for anything good.

He has already warned you about who he is and will do.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not like you saw he was in the hospital and then said, \"Not my problem.\" Or, \"I know you're in pain, but I still need to cool off.\" (referencing a post from a couple days ago wherein OP did exactly this). You turned off your phone, not only a common practice when you need space, but something a lot of people do as a practice while they're asleep.\n\nPeople are responsible for their own actions. You didn't tell him to be a shit driver and run a red light - this is 100% his fault. I've had to drive away from many fights and here I am in my 30s never having run a red light. He needs to hold himself accountable for what he did or he'll never grow as a person. So don't accept that blame unfairly because you'd just be enabling him. If he can get away with blaming you for causing an accident, which could have turned out *much* worse, then what else could he blame you for?\n\nDoes he make a habit of blaming his actions on you? \"You made me do this\" type person? Because that's terrifying as fuck and a huge red flag...", "The only behavior you can be responsible for is your own. Telling you it\u2019s all your fault is a self-serving, childish lie and the kind of thing abusers tell their victims. Maybe he\u2019s not an abuser, but his behavior sends those signals. Do not be an asshole to yourself and ignore this. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He asked you to get out and then he said \"running away\"? He \"had run a red light\" and now he's blaming you for his accident? He's the one who's immature here. And his behavior is childish and ridiculous, yes, it's a red flag.", "NTA \n\nYou were safe at a friends house to cool off. There was literally no reason whatsoever for him to come after you. Not meaning to sound harsh, but it\u2019s all his fault. He\u2019s the one who chose to go out while he was still angry and not concentrating and he ran a red light. You can\u2019t control his actions. The fact he went after you even though you were safe is a red flag. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t stay with him if he\u2019s going to blame you. That\u2019s a major AH move on his half. Especially after sounding threatening to you before you left. He\u2019s the reason you left, he\u2019s the reason why he ran a red light and ended up in hospital. He\u2019s lucky him and the other driver are ok.", "NTA.\n\nYou told him you were safe, then blocked him so you could have the space and time you needed to think, just like you had already told him you needed.\n\nHim doing the stupid 'chase' thing was HIS choice and the consequences are NOT your fault.", "By the age of 28 most men have outgrown that sort of idiotic, childish, and irresponsible behaviour.   Your BF needs to grow up and stop blaming everybody else for his bad choices.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What you did was actually the mature and right thing to do, even with parents of crying babies, experts all say it is best to walk away for a minute. In situations where police are called because of loud fighting, they always say one person should leave for the night to let things cool off. My therapist always said it's better to walk away, let tempers cool, do not try to talk when your that angry. Your boyfriend was wrong to come after you. You made a clear statement,  I am safe, spending the night with Daisy, love ua, talk tomorrow. Thay was the right thing to do. Him saying get out, followed with the doing something he would regret is concerning. Follow that up with he came after you, probably driving stupid, because he was so angry, then pointing the guilty finger at you. Just no. He needs to seek some therapy.", "Eh no NTA. This shouldn't even be in question. \n\nYou got into an argument and he got so angry he told you to leave before he did sth he'd regret. To me that sounds like he threatened violence. So you get out per his request and you go to a friend and even let him know and that you're safe and you love him. And still he comes tearing after you like a maniac resulting in a crash that not only endangered him but others? What exactly did he expect to do once he caught up to you? \n\nAnd he has the audacity to blame you? Only A H I see here are him and his best friend.  \n\nIf someone got so angry at me they told me to get out before they did sth you can be sure I'd get out of there and I would not be nice enough to send them a reassuring text.

He had an accident, because he is an irresponsible driver, and had run a red light.  - NONE of this is YOUR fault.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: He has anger issues, he threatened you, he is guilting you for HIS irresponsible driving. - \n\n**THIS is the point where you go to the appartment, take your stuff, tell him it is over, and block his number. HE THREATENED YOU; and he had a blackout rage - THAT caused his accident. You are lucky he did not catch up with you instead.**", "NTA, you were threatened and made the smart move by leaving. You're not responsible for him chasing after you, and you're not responsible for him driving recklessly.

I barely even remember what it was that we were arguing about, but it escalated and at one point, we were both speaking with raised voices, not quite screaming but close enough.\n\nThe one thing I remember very clearly is how he told me to \"get out before he did something he\u2018d regret\". I don\u2018t think he was genuinely going to hurt me, but in that moment, those words did something to me and I just grabbed my phone and took off.\n\nI called my best friend Daisy (26F), who was kind enough to come pick me up and took me to her flat. \nShe told me that maybe spending the night away from each other wasn\u2018t the worst idea to give both of us time to think about what had happened and advised me to not make any decisions in the heat of the moment. \n\nI texted Liam to please not worry, that I was safe with Daisy and would be spending the night at her\u2018s. I asked him to please give me some time to think, but said that I\u2018d be ready to talk the next day and that I loved him. \nI turned off my phone without waiting for an answer and the rest of the night was relatively uneventful with me nodding off on the couch at some point.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up and turned on my phone to be faced with missed calls and messages from Liam, his best friend (29M) and his brother (26M).\n\nApparently after my message, he had taken off after me and had run a red light, resulting him to collide with another car. Luckily, both my boyfriend and the other driver got away with concussions and a few bruises.\n\nAfter I had read those messages, Daisy took me to the hospital and I went to check on Liam who was doing alright considering the circumstances.

I was trying to put pieces of Liam together specifically. The fact is, it isn't uncommon for people to develop a victim complex if they experienced trauma outside of their control as a child, like abuse.

But we're ALL a product of our upbringing, and we all eventually face a crossroads of continuing to practice that behavior or rebuke it.
