He mentioned his education/experience and it briefly made me question my own sanity. He called me unprofessional and acted like I don\u2019t have my dog\u2019s best interest in mind.

We had a vet tell us our dog couldn't have food allergies because they don't work the same way as a human. Low and behold we did an allergy panel and he has multiple foods he can't eat.

There are great, highly qualified amazing vets out there who work long hours taking care of our furry family members and there are not so competent ones.

You were right to grab your fur baby and leave.", "NTA. \nSomething similar happened to me years ago: I brought my dog in for a skin infection\u2014which she\u2019d had a few times before, so I knew what prescriptions I needed\u2014but the regular vet wasn\u2019t there. The vet covering for him told me the skin would get better on its own, but my dog needed a dental cleaning\u2026which had to be done the next day, at a cost of thousands of dollars. I said no and walked out. By the time I could get in to see my regular vet, the skin infection was much worse.\n\nI told my regular vet if I had to see that other vet ever again, I was switching clinics. I got the feeling a lot of patients complained, because a few weeks later they told me the other vet was no longer working in their clinic.", "NTA. Why would you be TA for calling a quack a quack??? He is. He always will be. Too many bad vets out there.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a vet but afaik it\u2019s pretty common practice to leave a mark on a dog after they are spayed/neutered. It\u2019s very odd that the vet talked to you so condescendingly and was dismissive of your dog\u2019s history.", "Is there a reason they thought your dog wasn't spayed? Signs of heat or something? Is the mark a scar or a tattoo?\n\nEDIT: To be clear the vet 100% could and should have communicated better, but I'm interested in whether there were reasons they suggested what they did.", "NTA. He's a total quack.", "that sounds like the unprofessional one is him. if he thinks the dog is not spayed despite you telling him she was, then he should explain exactly why he thinks that! Did he even address the ear? crazy!", "NTA\nUnfortunately, not all vets or even doctors for that matter hold themselves to the highest ethical standards. As a fellow pet owner, I am so happy you called him out on his BS.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t help but to compare the similarities to your vet saying \u201cthis surgery needs to be done TODAY\u201d and the scam email I get that say \u201cClick this link NOW or you\u2019ll lose all money in your bank account!!!\u201d", "NTA.\n\nFuck him. Good on you for standing up for yourself, the world would be less shitty if we all took a moment out of our lives to say \"Hey this is dumb bullshit and you're wrong.\"\n\nEdit: however I wouldn't have called him a quack, since that implies a fake doctor making fake diagnoses on a fake human patient. Calling a dumb vet tech a \"quack\" disparages all the honest to god quacks out there making an honest living.", "NTA. He called YOU unprofessional? You're a customer!

And leave a review and report to whoever handles the licensing", "I was a pooper scooper at a vet's office and even i know what the spay mark means. Dude's such a quack he needs an avian vet.", "NTA and this vet is scary. Spaying is a major operation and I've never known a vet not trust records sent over. And even then more usual to wait until you see signs that the dog has not been spayed before acting rather than opening up and risking anaesthetic for a look see. \n\nBut not treating an ear infection is pretty serious - not meaning to be judgemental but they can lead to hearing loss.Definitely that should be your priority and glad she has got her first round of treatment.

If a vet condescendingly called me sweetie and tried to pull that shit with me, I would make it my personal mission to destroy his \"career\" after I completely ripped him to shreds in the exam room.

Unless you're a granny, don't call me sweetie. My PCP is like this. I hate him, he asked if I had any lady problems instead of using normal medical terminology among many other things. It was so costly just for an establishing care visit and my current medications are really difficult to get so I can't switch providers atm. \n\nAnyway, sorry you're going through that OP. Is Care Credit an option for you? It was a life saver for me and my cat. Otherwise you may be able to find discounted vet care, where I'm at, it's called Value Pet Clinic. \n\nr/askvet has some financial info in the wiki for US and Canada as well as a link for state specific resources but I'm not sure where you're located. Good luck OP", "Her normal vet is absolutely amazing and now that I have someone to compare her too, she\u2019s even more amazing. Unfortunately they don\u2019t have any programs to help with bills so I\u2019ve gotta figure out the $100 for the next round BUT I\u2019d rather do it at the normal vet than anywhere else", "It made me question myself. Like does he know something I don\u2019t know? Like did my normal vet\u2026not actually complete the surgery? I wanted to think of every possible scenario before flipping out on the guy but also know I\u2019m not stupid even if it\u2019s not my field", "Idk why he\u2019d believe the vaccinations (especially rabies) but not the surgery paperwork.", "No that odd if you consider the fact the vet was trying to strong-arm OP into an unnecessary duplicative procedure. Some (well, most) snake oil salesman operate this way. OP, NTA and I\u2019d be reporting this issue to the appropriate licensing body.", "It\u2019s that little green tattoo and when I asked him for clarification (in case I was somehow wrong) he wouldn\u2019t actually give a reason why he thought she was upspayed. It was legit like talking to a brick wall, even after showing him her records", "The techs treated her ear and said it\u2019ll take another round. He basically repeated what they said when he came in, and then went onto the spay thing.", "True! Like dude her ear is what needs to be fixed today and even if I did have the money, getting spayed isnt a huge priority in comparison to a freakin ear infection. I just want her to feel better", "Thanks. I think I questioned myself simply bc this is someone with a PhD. I know that doesn\u2019t automatically make them smart nor a good person, but it made me hesitate, I admit.", "I\u2019m starting to think their reviews were artificially inflated.

The other vet there is great though..", "You shouldn't have a pet if you can't afford it, I'm sorry. Ear infections are SO unbelievably painful and your poor dog is suffering because you didn't set aside emergency money. This makes me so sad.", "The only way the vet would KNOW she wasn't spayed would be to LOOK inside. Did he open her up? Do anything beyond glance at her?", "\u2026off topic but do they actually sell snake oil or they\u2019re just called that?", "Remember to report this guy. If he is doing it to you. It means he is also probably trying to scam others. He most likely was trying to gaslight you into something you already did. So he could say they did it this time by not needing to do any actual surgery. Since then he wouldnt have to risk messing something up if he didnt have to respay an already spayed dog.\n\nJust sit around with the dog and do nothing for an appropraite amount of time. Guy is a lazy shit. Which might put a lot of animals at risk.", "Yeah, that's bizarre. Scars don't really mean much because there are plenty of other surgeries an animal can have. But the green tattoo literally exists to identify an animal as spayed.", "Is there an indication of blood type anywhere in your dog's records or do you have a large cooperative dog? There have been cases of dogs taken into unnecessary surgeries and the owner is told the dog has died but is instead kept for transfusions.", "wow. It seems like once he said was confronted with the fact that she was already spayed, he didn't want to admit his error!", "OP got laid off. How about you offer them a job if you wanna be useful.", "Yeah there were con men who sold \"remedies\" that they claimed included snake oil. There also are actual oils made from snakes, the Chinese used it a lot in traditional medicine, but a lot of the stuff American conmen used never contained any actual snake oils.", "This!", "Nah I have nothing with her blood type on it. She\u2019s kinda smedium. Like 35 pounds. I have heard that to be a thing tho", "Maybe it was pride?", "probably; too much of it."]}
