I had my appendix removed in the second grade, but when they went in they found other issues. They still removed my appendix as my family has a history of bad ones. Jump to my 20s.

There\u2019s no excuse for a vet to be like that.  Owning dogs for over 40 years, I\u2019ve dealt with several over the last 15 years when I moved to a new location.  My previous vet, before the current one ticked me off with providing quotes to procedures without discussing them with me before hand.  The last straw was him telling me my 16 year old dog, that I had taken in for an eye ulcer needed an operation to remove the eye and called a vet ophthalmologist to perform the surgery without me going in for a consult first.  That would have cost me $4K. When I declined and opted for meds, I took my dog in 6 months later to the eye doctor for an evaluation only to be told he was and would have been too old to perform that type of surgery on.  He passed away 1.5 years later.  Thankfully my new vet with my current dogs is great.", "I just had an issue with my vet. I have an 18 month old pup. Noticed a lump on the roof of her mouth. The vet said, \"Oh, it's an Epulis.  No big deal, we can treat it with antibiotics and steriods.\" That was on January 3rd. She told me to come back on 2 weeks for a recheck. My pup finished all the meds, and it's just getting worse. It's starting to bleed a bit when she eats. The vet says, \"we can just slice it off and cauterize it.\" And sets up an appointment for January 30th to get it removed (this was at the recheck on the 19th). I was told to go to the vet to get her lab work done on January 23rd. Over that weekend, my poor dogs mouth was bleeding more often. Woke up on the 23rd and called the vet to say her mouth was really bleeding. Please can I see the vet when we come in for the bloodwork. I was told no. The vet leaves before my appointment for the blood draw, and she's booked solid. I couldn't stand to see my pup like that, so I ran her out to the vet hospital and the vets there couldn't do anything about the bleeding but did put me in touch with the nicest, most caring vet I have ever met. He took pity on me crying over the phone and offered to do surgery on her the next day. By the next morning (the day of the surgery), she was bleeding heavily. Drove her to the surgeons office (the inside of my car is completely ruined by the poor pup) and the surgeon wasn't very optimistic but agreed to do the surgery seeing as how the lump hadn't spread to her nasal cavity or brain. My poor pup lost 4 teeth and a small portion of bone. I called my old vet to cancel the appointment and tell them why, and all she said was, \"ok, I took it off the books.\" Turns out my pup has a rare, aggressive form of cancer.  For 3 weeks prior to the surgery, my old vet was telling me it's nothing, and she can just slice it off, making me think that I was crazy for being so worried.
