We are very excited for this new adventure. The trip will be around the time our baby is 3 months old. My wife thinks that this is not a good time to go on this trip. It is possible for me to do this work remote, so it's not that I have to go to Europe. \n\n\nMy wife will not be working at this time so child care is not a concern.

I mean it's not like she needs my support in this crucial time at all. \n\nI mean, I might be her spouse but she has in-laws around, I don't even really have to be a father during the night so my wife can get some rest. And honestly, it's not like she ever needs a break from being a first time parent. She should be fine with little to no sleep with a newborn, constantly getting up and down to feed and change them through the day and night, with no relief from me, the spouse who claims to love her but doesn't really understand what the big deal is\"\n\n\nYou're so right, OP.

This is not something you can even try to wrap your head around right now when you haven't experienced the \"4th trimester\" for yourself. \n\nYour wife will carry this baby for 9 months, literally rip her body open to get it out, and then be tortured through sleep deprivation while she's trying to heal. So the first 3 months, it's your job to take care of HER and the baby. At 3 months she may be just starting to physically feel normal again.  That's about the time I started being able to shower AND brush my teeth in the same day! Hooray! But there's a good chance she'll be dealing with postpartum mental health issues. That is NOT the time for you to voluntarily leave the country for 2 weeks. \n\nFor context, Prince Harry left the country for 24 hours for a charity event when his son was a month old.

First off, why do you call YOUR child \u201cA baby\u201d. This is YOUR baby, not A baby. Will your in laws be living in your home 24/7 during this time? No?

But on the flip side she could have a really rough birthing with complications and the baby could be having a hard time too or there could be emergencies. Regardless, she and the baby will likely need some extra hands help if you're gone. \n\nTalk with your wife, tell her you will respect her final decision.

After all she gave up much more than 2 weeks in her job to give birth to your child\n\n2) she will not go through any emotional distress during the time when you're gone - i.e. you've given her enough security and comfort she doesn't feel abandoned (esp during the emotional period post pregnancy) \n\nRemember your job does not equal to your career, and you are not married to it (I hope not).

I get wanting to go on this trip because it is a nice opportunity, but there is a major sleep regression that happens around 3 or 4 months with babies. It is absolutely miserable for the parents, and sometimes the kid is even extra miserable. If you can do this all remotely and it won't impact your career I would strongly recommend staying home. Europe will still be there when your kid is older, or you can take a trip with the family.", "NTA. I\u2019m honestly surprised at all of the comments suggesting otherwise. Your wife will be a SAHM and yes it will be a rough 2 weeks but she\u2019ll have plenty of other support from family. I was a SAHM until recently to a 6 year old and 2 year old and I would not have denied my husband this experience and hope he\u2019d do the same for me.

I think NAH and I\u2019m not sure what the right answer is. When do you have to decide? And I know your in-laws are close, but does your wife feel comfortable enough around her and/or your parents for them to really be helpful in the early postpartum time period?

Or they may sleep all on their own. \nThey may develop a predictable routine that makes you both think it'll be fine if you go. And they may throw that routine out the window the very next day because of sleep regression, a developmental leap, or something else entirely. With a newborn, you never know what tomorrow brings. And let me be very clear on this. While you two have the most wonderful time ahead of you, it'll likely be the most difficult thing you've ever done- adjusting to the new life.

We are very excited for this new adventure. The trip will be around the time our baby is 3 months old. My wife thinks that this is not a good time to go on this trip. It is possible for me to do this work remote, so it's not that I have to go to Europe. \n\n\nMy wife will not be working at this time so child care is not a concern.

I\u2019ve had two kids and by 3 months I was totally healed, going about my normal life although obvs with a baby and then with a toddler and a baby. 2 weeks on my own would have been hard but not impossible. Esp with parents only 10 minutes away. My hubs worked full time anyway, except for his two weeks paternity, so, apart from doing bedtime routine and giving me a bit of a break, him being away for 2 weeks wouldn\u2019t be a massive difference.

First of all, OP is considering whether to do this at this point. Secondly, there is probably an effect on OP\u2019s career if they go, and a different effect if they don\u2019t go.

When my daughter was 10 months old I went from being a SAHD to working full time. When I came home from my first day of work my daughter refused to look at me because she was (presumably) pissed that I had abandoned her for 10 hours with nobody but mom and grandma to keep her company. When I was a SAHD I think my wife went on a two night trip for work and while it was doable, it was a little difficult. It was probably around the 3mo mark actually. We lived in a foreign country so we had no support network around and not having a break for two days was rough. If OP is going to be gone she will need t friend or family member to either stay with or have stay with her to give her a break a couple times a day.\n\nOP and his wife need to sit down and take about all of the angles to this WRT OP\u2019s career and going on the trip is a sacrifice they should be making.", "Personally I wouldn't have had a problem with it, I pretty much did all the care anyway including taking care of two teens (my nieces so not even my own) schlepping them around.\n\nBut your wife isn't confortable with that thought.

There could also be complications that would make her situation even worse. Not to mention the stresses of being a first time parent. She\u2019s probably very excited but also super anxious about being a parent, and not providing emotional and physical support will absolutely impact your relationship negatively. \n\nIf you work somewhere where they\u2019re willing to send you on this trip now, odds are you have a fairly decent income where you can take the trip later with your wife and kid, or you\u2019ll get another opportunity in the future.

Or they come over and clean the kitchen / vacuum / do laundry.\nActually, at 3 months I always enjoyed going outside with my baby / kids. Handling them was never an issue.
