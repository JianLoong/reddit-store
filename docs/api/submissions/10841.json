We are very excited for this new adventure. The trip will be around the time our baby is 3 months old. My wife thinks that this is not a good time to go on this trip. It is possible for me to do this work remote, so it's not that I have to go to Europe. \n\n\nMy wife will not be working at this time so child care is not a concern. Our in laws both live within 10 minutes so we are also not without a support system in the 2 weeks. \n\n\nI am conflicted because on the one hand I would love this experience, but I also know it would be unfair to leave my wife to take care of the child for 2 weeks while I'm away having fun.\n\nReddit, WIBTA if I still went on this work trip?", "created_utc": 1677272487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11b1z1u/wibta_if_i_travelled_while_my_wife_took_care_of_a/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean it's not like she needs my support in this crucial time at all. \n\nI mean, I might be her spouse but she has in-laws around, I don't even really have to be a father during the night so my wife can get some rest. And honestly, it's not like she ever needs a break from being a first time parent. She should be fine with little to no sleep with a newborn, constantly getting up and down to feed and change them through the day and night, with no relief from me, the spouse who claims to love her but doesn't really understand what the big deal is\"\n\n\nYou're so right, OP.

This is not something you can even try to wrap your head around right now when you haven't experienced the \"4th trimester\" for yourself. \n\nYour wife will carry this baby for 9 months, literally rip her body open to get it out, and then be tortured through sleep deprivation while she's trying to heal. So the first 3 months, it's your job to take care of HER and the baby. At 3 months she may be just starting to physically feel normal again.  That's about the time I started being able to shower AND brush my teeth in the same day! Hooray! But there's a good chance she'll be dealing with postpartum mental health issues. That is NOT the time for you to voluntarily leave the country for 2 weeks. \n\nFor context, Prince Harry left the country for 24 hours for a charity event when his son was a month old.

First off, why do you call YOUR child \u201cA baby\u201d. This is YOUR baby, not A baby. Will your in laws be living in your home 24/7 during this time? No?

But on the flip side she could have a really rough birthing with complications and the baby could be having a hard time too or there could be emergencies. Regardless, she and the baby will likely need some extra hands help if you're gone. \n\nTalk with your wife, tell her you will respect her final decision.

After all she gave up much more than 2 weeks in her job to give birth to your child\n\n2) she will not go through any emotional distress during the time when you're gone - i.e. you've given her enough security and comfort she doesn't feel abandoned (esp during the emotional period post pregnancy) \n\nRemember your job does not equal to your career, and you are not married to it (I hope not).

I get wanting to go on this trip because it is a nice opportunity, but there is a major sleep regression that happens around 3 or 4 months with babies. It is absolutely miserable for the parents, and sometimes the kid is even extra miserable. If you can do this all remotely and it won't impact your career I would strongly recommend staying home. Europe will still be there when your kid is older, or you can take a trip with the family.", "NTA. I\u2019m honestly surprised at all of the comments suggesting otherwise. Your wife will be a SAHM and yes it will be a rough 2 weeks but she\u2019ll have plenty of other support from family. I was a SAHM until recently to a 6 year old and 2 year old and I would not have denied my husband this experience and hope he\u2019d do the same for me.

I think NAH and I\u2019m not sure what the right answer is. When do you have to decide? And I know your in-laws are close, but does your wife feel comfortable enough around her and/or your parents for them to really be helpful in the early postpartum time period?

It's not a black and white situation. You never know how the baby turns out. They might sleep through the nights and consistently during the day, waking up only to feed and change. Or they may wake up 10 times during nights, and sleep very inconsistently during the day. They may only sleep while nursing. Or they may sleep all on their own. \nThey may develop a predictable routine that makes you both think it'll be fine if you go. And they may throw that routine out the window the very next day because of sleep regression, a developmental leap, or something else entirely. With a newborn, you never know what tomorrow brings. And let me be very clear on this. While you two have the most wonderful time ahead of you, it'll likely be the most difficult thing you've ever done- adjusting to the new life. If the adjustment comes with severe sleep deprivation, no new parent should be alone during this time. The toll it takes on your mental and physical stamina is something else. \n\nCongrats on becoming a father!\n\nSource: I have a 15month old daughter who is just now beginning to sleep properly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While we are there, my team wants to do some sight-seeing, hiking, etc. I have no had the opportunity to experience another country before or travel to this extent.\n\n\nThe issue is that after our company announced this trip, we found out my wife(29F) is pregnant. We are very excited for this new adventure. The trip will be around the time our baby is 3 months old. My wife thinks that this is not a good time to go on this trip. It is possible for me to do this work remote, so it's not that I have to go to Europe. \n\n\nMy wife will not be working at this time so child care is not a concern. Our in laws both live within 10 minutes so we are also not without a support system in the 2 weeks. \n\n\nI am conflicted because on the one hand I would love this experience, but I also know it would be unfair to leave my wife to take care of the child for 2 weeks while I'm away having fun.\n\nReddit, WIBTA if I still went on this work trip?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Plan a spa day for her to be pampered while you watch the baby. If the answer is no and you have the ability to work remotely then stay home.

Show her that she and the baby are more important than any site you could ever travel to.", "WBTA if you don't communicate with your wife what you want and what she wants then reach a compromise. I would say, as a SAHF of 3, that I would be okay if my wife had/wanted to leave for work for a week or 2. However in my circumstance my wife never has to leave for work so if it's a consistent thing that she's gone for work I would say leaving for 2 weeks with a 3 month old would probably be a no. It's all about communication make sure your wife knows that you are excited about the trip and that you really wanted to go and that you were also conflicted because you don't want to leave her you don't want to be away from your child.

I would be pissed off and so incredibly resentful that he tossed aside his parenting duties within months of our child's birth.\n\n I would also feel completely betrayed - at three months, her body will still be recovering from childbirth. OP is the person she is supposed to be able to rely on to take care of her during this time, not friends or in-laws. If she has a c-section, she will literally be juuuust healing at that time if there are zero complications. She will also be dealing with things like bleeding, cracked nipples if she's breastfeeding, the frustration of struggling to figure out how to soothe a new baby while completely exhausted, and the hormone dump that is why the three months after birth are referred to as the fourth trimester. He is the one supposed to be there to hold her and share ~~of~~ in this struggle, not to ditch those responsibilities ~~as~~ at the first opportunity.\n\nIf my spouse abandoned me after childbirth with our newborn to go on an optional trip...I honestly don't think I'd still be there when he got back. Fuck that.\n\nEdit: typos", "No 3 month old sleeps through the night. Not a single one in the world.

My first Birth i got very sick after giving birth, I couldnt move by myself and needed my husbands help to evem stand or sit, second baby, i was full of energy vacuuming 2 days out of the hospital it a baby strapped to my chest. Baby could be super easy or super hard. If its important for your career to be there in person you should have a conversation with your wife about it and try to compromise. If its not going to do anything for work, and you just want to experience Europe, maybe you should do it remotely to support your wife and child. I think you should also discuss with your boss the possibility of planning to go but making final decisions after your chold is born so you know more what your wife will be dealing with.", "Same. I am in the minority looking at all these answers, but as long as it\u2019s not a colicky baby or a baby with medical conditions, 3 months is an easy age.

These are two completely separate considerations.\n\nAlso, speaking as someone who has actually had a child (pretty obvious you haven't), there are good reasons that midwives and dictors now talk about the \"fourth trimester\". The first few months post-partum are an extremely challenging time both physically and mentally for new mothers.
