A woman sometimes needs to feel pretty, and not because hubby says so. In his defense and something you should reassure him about is society drums into our heads - new look means affair.

Hubby may have had an underlying reason for his less than supportive response (worried he had forgotten an important event, felt slobbier than normal in comparison, worried that he's not able to keep you happy...). If you can get him to talk about it, you can also ease his mind about it.\n2. If he just won't open up/doesn't have that kind of a reason, you can tell him that your look is not about him and not his decision either. It feels nice to you to dress up for a change; you don't need him to change for you. You don't know how long/often you will want, but hubby can keep his unsupportive comments to himself.", "NTA makeup and fashion is only for the person wearing it, your husband is welcome to shut up.", "He may prefer you without makeup and indifferent to pretty clothes because that is the you he has known and been happy with.  Your interest in looking pretty has him worried that you are looking for make attention and that scares him.  \n\nPart of the problem with women\u2019s interest in being attractive is that men assume the only reason a woman should be interested in dressing up is to attract a boyfriend.  The idea that women dress up and enjoy makeup at times is because women enjoy it for its own sake.  \n\nIt may help if you can get him to do a mini makeover for himself.  He may wear very informal clothes and believe anything better as uncomfortable.  \n\nA new haircut, casual clothes that are very comfortable (now available everywhere) cool shoes, could surprise him with how much he likes the look.\n\nBut he has to be open to it.  So you may need to enlist help if there is anyone in your circle who can join the effort.  Tshirts and jeans have been a guy uniform since the 60\u2019s.  Style is back and looks are becoming more formal but comfortable in recent years.  \n\nMaybe going to a movie and pointing out newer male looks will help.  \n\nIf you can get him interested in upgrading his look at least some if the time, he may be less threatened and more appreciative of your new interest.  \n\nMaybe start with buying him a pair of higher styled athletic shoes or a jacket.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. I did the same thing in my late 30s and became high maintenance with makeup, hair color, clothes and especially shoes!

Congratulations on the make over!", "NTA - We all grow and change, even in marriage, and he's just gotta go with the flow.", "NTA.  He is.

You dont have to gussy up for me, but since you did, let retire to the boudoir!\u201d  even if it wasnt sexy time, just saying you are making it sexy is compliment isnt it? Its not hard to satisfy a good woman. Love her, thank her and compliment her.  There are milli9ns of ways to do all three. On a daily basis.", "NTA.  You're beautiful as you are, but only if you look and dress as he wants.  Yikes.", "Totally agree. He might be feeling insecure or think that you making that change meant that you had been feeling insecure, hence the constant you don't need makeup comment. Sometimes men just don't understand that putting on makeup and dressing up is just fun, plain and simple, and not something you're doing for them or because of something you're going through. I went through a makeup kick for a few years which absolutely baffled my husband until I explained that I found the ritualistic nature of the whole thing really soothing and it's a fun creative outlet.", ">you don\u2019t need to look good for anyone other than yourself \n\nHow is it possible to wear a \u201ctrendier dress\u201d purely to look good for yourself?

But as soon as you confirmed that you wanted to try it he should have completely chilled out. I think it's a good instinct to make totally sure you didn't feel like you had to doll up to impress him, but it sounds like he actually made you feel bad about yourself, which is the opposite of that kind of reassurance. He's definitely in the wrong here. NTA!", "NAH so far. Your husband is bordering. If you\u2019ve been in a routine for a while, it\u2019s understandable that a change might throw him off. He might even be worried you changed for someone else. That unfortunately happens too often. He also might think you\u2019re going to expect him to suddenly change. Maybe trying to sit down with him and explain it\u2019s all for you and nothing weird is going on he might be more understanding. If he gets worse or does something with your new things, then you need to worry. He sounds like he\u2019s just worried about you and trying to reassure you that he still loves you because he thinks something is up.", "NTA,\n\nBut, because I haven't seen it mentioned yet I'm just going to point out that \"your spouse is suddenly showing more care in their appearance when they had previously seemed relaxed about it\" is something that I've frequently seen referenced as a possible sign of an affair. I don't particularly agree, but the rational of the argument is that we tend to put more care into our appearance when we're excited about a new romantic connection, whereas we become comfortable letting go a little bit around established partners.\n\nYour husband may have been worried that the sudden change signals some level of dissatisfaction with the status quo of your relationship, even if he didn't jump to \"on no an affair!\"  If that's the case, I don't think that makes him an asshole, it's ok to need reassurance sometimes.", "NTA. I kinda understand that your husband wasn\u2019t expecting you to suddenly look a bit different, so he was probably just surprised because, to him, it came out of nowhere. I\u2019m not saying you should have to discuss this kind of thing with him - its completely up to you and I support your right to change your appearance for any or no reason at any time - but I just see how it might have been a little bit of a shock to him. \nHowever, it\u2019s your face, your body and I assume your money, so unless you are in financial trouble or spent a lot of his/joint money, it\u2019s your choice and I think you should go for it.", "> He probably got upset because of insecurities related to you looking beautiful and leaving him for someone else or just attracting other male attention.\n\nExactly what I thought...", "Totally agree...but I say NAH...he just needs time...", "When someone inevitably replaces old trendy clothes with new trendy clothes, is it because their personal tastes suddenly changed, or is it because society has moved on?\n\nContinuing to wear last years \u201ctrendy\u201d dress doesn\u2019t allow you to be viewed as cool or pretty in the same way it did last year. That\u2019s why people throw it out.  \n\nClothes give us a status in other peoples eyes.  People who dress trendy (even if they think they\u2019re purely doing it for themselves) are looking at themselves through other peoples eyes. \n\nIsn\u2019t it strange that peoples\u2019 sense of style (that is purely for themselves, I swear) always seems to align with the trends of the society they find themselves in?", "Wow buddy you're a real iconoclast", "> When someone inevitably replaces old trendy clothes with new trendy clothes, is it because their personal tastes suddenly changed, or is it because society has moved on?\n\nA bit of both, I'd say. I usually buy clothes from \"fast fashion\" stores, mainly for the price. But the stores follow trends, and that changes what's available to buy. When there are new fashions in, and I'm looking for new clothes, I try them on. If I like them on me, I buy them. If not, I look somewhere else, or, often, just don't buy new clothes."]}
