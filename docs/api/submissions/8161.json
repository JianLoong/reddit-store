If he just won't open up/doesn't have that kind of a reason, you can tell him that your look is not about him and not his decision either.

Your interest in looking pretty has him worried that you are looking for make attention and that scares him.  \n\nPart of the problem with women\u2019s interest in being attractive is that men assume the only reason a woman should be interested in dressing up is to attract a boyfriend.  The idea that women dress up and enjoy makeup at times is because women enjoy it for its own sake.  \n\nIt may help if you can get him to do a mini makeover for himself.  He may wear very informal clothes and believe anything better as uncomfortable.  \n\nA new haircut, casual clothes that are very comfortable (now available everywhere) cool shoes, could surprise him with how much he likes the look.\n\nBut he has to be open to it.  So you may need to enlist help if there is anyone in your circle who can join the effort.  Tshirts and jeans have been a guy uniform since the 60\u2019s.  Style is back and looks are becoming more formal but comfortable in recent years.  \n\nMaybe going to a movie and pointing out newer male looks will help.  \n\nIf you can get him interested in upgrading his look at least some if the time, he may be less threatened and more appreciative of your new interest.  \n\nMaybe start with buying him a pair of higher styled athletic shoes or a jacket.", "NTA.

Neither are bad. \n\nIf I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he was just a little surprised at the change and wanted to make sure you didn't feel pressured by society to start wearing makeup and fancy clothes etc. \n\nThe cynical side of me is reminded of my ex who felt ESPECIALLY threatened when I went to buy new more business casual clothes from a thrift store when I started a new job; he wanted me to be his chill, fun, music festival hippy girlfriend who was always in macrame tops and booty shorts (even at work), and when I wanted to display more professionalism he felt threatened that I was growing beyond him and thus growing away from him (he was 10 yrs my senior, was hella childish himself, and had never held down any kind of job where he had to look proper). He didn't want me to be \"better\" than him or to attract \"better\" people than him due to his own deep insecurities. \n\nSo, all of that to say that while I'm sure it's nothing malicious, it *could maybe possibly* be something of that nature, and just be on the lookout for that kind of thing.", "NAH\n\nI understand you're feeling hurt, but your husband didn't actually say anything objectively hurtful. Continue dressing how you enjoy and he will get used to your new look.", "NTA  \nI could be off base, but it kind of sounds like your husband might be more worried about the money spent on the stuff rather than the look.  \nRegardless, NTA", "I think your husband is coming from a genuine, but misguided place. Him being a man, I wouldn't expect him to understand the value of makeup as a way of self expression, rather than something superficial, born of insecurity. NTA.", "NTA: your body, your choice how you dress and makeup. Sounds like you have an insecure husband. Instead of bringing you up more and applauding your look he\u2019s trying to bring you down to his comfort level.", "NTA. My wife is natural 99% of the time. I prefer her that way, but there are times she puts contacts in, do her makeup, and dress up.  We usually go out for the evening. The reward after the evening is worth her effort and mine to support her desire to do something different. You do you.", "Why did this post make me so sad...oof. I don't know OP, but I hate your husbands behavior. He had no right to tear you down when you looked so nice and were soooo happy to share this with him. \n\nI'm hoping it's some insecurity and him making some bullshit in his mind that you're cheating on him and that's hwat he's worried about. But even that's some red flags.\n\nClearly he has some made up ideas about women dressing up and wearing make up. \n\nAll to say, NTA. I hope you continue dressing in the ways you enjoy and disregard your husband completely until he comes to terms with his internal biases.", "NTA\n\nI wonder if maybe your husband's understanding of makeup and dressing up is different than yours. Maybe he thinks it is a sign you don't feel pretty and *need* these things to feel good about yourself, and he thinks he's doing the right thing by expressing he dislikes it. I think you should tell him that makeup and clothes are a fun way you used to express yourself and you want to get back into them. \n\nNow, maybe he is just a jerk who has a very vocal \"preferred look.\" Even so, you still have the right to play with clothes and makeup. You don't dictate every aspect of his appearance, do you? So why should he dictate yours?", "NAH I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion oh well. I can see the husband's concern (F here). You said some things that stuck out to me like \"aged me down\" and \"prettiest I've felt\" which makes me think this isn't changing up your look just for funsies. There is nothing wrong with enjoying these things like looking younger, wearing dressier clothes but it's not impossible for them to also raise red flags. Maybe your husband feels that his actions have led to you to changing your look, like he isn't being attentive enough or something. Or he thinks you're feeling insecure in how you naturally look and thus are using make-up to \"feel prettier\". I also don't think he needs to like your look which is something that you were upset by; from what I understand this wasn't for him, it was something you did for you.\n\nNow where your husband might be borderline A H is when he wanted you to take the look off. Like that is not for him to decide but you took it off too, like why? If this look is for you, does it really matter whether he likes it or not? I understand where people think it's rude how he responded but it's clear to me that he thinks you did this for him. My fiance hates denim skirts but I love them so I'll wear them. It doesn't matter whether he thinks they look good, it matters if I do. If he has a problem with you wearing this stuff (for yourself) to the point where he doesn't want it on you then he is the A H. Really can't say much more than this without more INFO on how you two really interpret this. Communicate.", "\nI woudn't say he messed with her confidence if anything he boosted her self confidence. Clearly he is an older man and maybe he's just not used to that. When you've known something for a long time it's hard to see that type of change as good. He just told her that he thought she was beautiful just the way she was maybe he thought she was feeling insecure and he wanted to reassure her. Maybe he even thought he didn't tell her enough so she felt like she had to.", "He's only 34. She felt good with the make up and the dress and he shamed her for wearing it. He's telling her everyday that she doesn't need makeup is making her think she was wrong for putting it on.", ">Clearly he is an older man\n\nClearly, you missed the first 3 words she typed that said \"My husband (34M). Last I checked, 34 is clearly not an older man. Are we clear?", "Lml I don't know why in my head I saw ages in the 50s. I stand by the other things I said tho about change and stuff. I don't he exactly shamed her for dressing up he just found it in extremely different from her norm. It's just something a simple conversation can fix.", "You are 100_percent_wrong", "Do what makes you happy, he was probably abit shocked and feeling insecure. He\u2019ll eventually get used to it. If you like dressing up and wearing makeup again do it because how you feel matters too.", "NTA- it\u2019s your body you can do with it as you please. If you felt good about yourself than that\u2019s all that matters and your husband should have said  you look amazing and made you feel great about yourself not make you feel bad for doing something that made you feel good in the first place. I\u2019m glad that he says you are beautiful without the makeup and dressing up but men need to realize women don\u2019t wear makeup and dress up for them we do it for ourselves to make us feel better and boost our confidence. Don\u2019t ever let anyone make you feel badly for doing something for yourself that made you feel good!", "NTA and husbands everywhere are smacking their foreheads.  He\u2019s giving us all a bad name.  That\u2019s like the first rule of marriage, notice clothes, hair, makeup, and nail polish.   Clothes and makeup are to make you happy.  Ideally, that should make the person we share life with happy that your happy.  Not always the case.  Sometimes it makes the other worry that your dressing up to impress someone else or sometimes they are just hopelessly a doofus and doesn\u2019t know how to compliment their spouse.", "NAH\n\nIt's your body, your choice, period! If you like it, that's really the most important thing.\n\nHowever, some people just genuinely don't like a \"made-up\" look. Myself included! I prefer a comfortable, casual, no-fuss look. I would never tell my partner \"don't dress up!\", but I definitely would feel confused or maybe even a little put off if they suddenly started dressing up fancier than usual in a regular basis. I wouldn't try to stop them, but I also wouldn't prefer it.\n\nA similar example: I stopped shaving my pits a year ago and my partner didn't love it, they let me know, I told them I understood but would still be doing it anyway. It wasn't a fight, it was just like... \"I like this\" \"I don't\" \"huh okay well agree to disagree I guess\", lol.", "People might hate on me here but...\n\nOMG I honestly think alot of women are jumping on the band wagon of nta while thinking only about her side let me add a touch here\n\nYour nta but neither is your husband so NAH \n\nBut you need to reassure your husband here and fast \nYou need to talk with your husband and explain what happened you were bored walked into sephora and the amazing ladies there showed you a new side of yourself and you liked the makeup look\n\nGreat now tell him your not doing this for anyone else there is some new hot guy talk8ng to you that you want other men looking at you \n\nI have been cheated on and THIS EXACT SAME SITUATION HAPPENED TO ME.\n\nGirlfriend looked great then changed her looks took me 2 months to find out it wasn't for me but from some dude that used her as a side piece then tossed her away and all of a sudden she was back to her old look for me\n\nSo you need to let him know please or if you get mad over this and don't address it you will put seeds of doubt (in you) in his mind and then it will go down hill from there\nPLEASE OP don't let this get too far \n\nMale minds are point a to point b and you might have just inserted point c\nGood luck", "NTA but this is a typical sign of what people do before they start looking for extra marital fun. So maybe he is tripping out? or feeling paranoid. Have you made new friends or been distant? Hangig at the office more? Idk probably safe to say yall meed to go to marriage counseling.", "Well, first impressions could have been \"oh fuck. What important date/event did I miss?!\". Then he tried to reassure OP that she was beautiful without makeup, and he even prefers her look without makeup.. and failed drastically.  The thoughts of expectations is a point. My husband loves sweats because they are comfortable. When I get dressed up to go out he asks me how dressed up he has to be. He dreads the answer of me saying to put on something nicer to match me. So, suddenly changing could put that worry that husband will also have to change his comfy style"]}
