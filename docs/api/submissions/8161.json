You can do whatever you want. I understand that it can be weird for your husband that he has known you for so long and you never did this before. I would talk to him about it. Why is he so angry that you had a different look? Is it the expense, the dress, the makeup? Is he worried that something changed because you met someone new? Hear him out and then explain your point of view.", "NTA. You are not responsible of his insecurities. He needs to work on himself and work through it. I would insist on dressing the way I want. What is important is that you feel beautiful and good in the way that you dress. You are not just supposed to dress in the way that makes him happy enough.", "NTA. Just because you're married doesn't mean he gets to tell you what to wear and whether you can wear makeup. If it makes you feel better about yourself, then he needs to back TF off and let you do whatever makes you happy.", "1000% NTA, but you need to tell your husband what's what. That you dont need his permission to dress up and that it doesnt matter if he likes it or not. Hes just insecure that if you dress up that means you want different men or that different men will look at you.", "NTA, but your husband is. You were not wrong for putting on making and wearing a dress that you like. Don't let him fuck with your self-confidence, or appearance. Don't let him dictate what you can or can't wear. He just has to get over it.", "NTA\n\nYour body - your choice!\n\nYour husband can take it or leave it. No question about this one.\n\nYou are more than allowed to dress up and change your appearance if you so desire, you ***do not*** need your husband's approval if that is what ***you*** want to do.", "NTA\n\n\n\nYou need to talk to your husband again and explain WHY you got the makeup and dress and HOW it made you feel.. He then needs to explain HOW that made him feel WHY he is upset.\n\n\nHe was confused because he probably thought he forgotten an important occasion and was trying to remember on the fly. He probably got upset because of insecurities related to you looking beautiful and leaving him for someone else or just attracting other male attention.\n\nKeep wearing your makeup and new outfits. Feel good about yourself. Give your husband reassurance this is what you want to feel good about yourself. Not about you wondering off. You need to at least get the new makeup a part of your new routine.", "NTA. Why do men assume we dress,  wear makeup,  etc for them? It makes you feel good. Do whatever makes you happy. If he cares for you,  he'll want you to be happy. As for him saying it isn't the look you have had for the last ten years... did he expect you to look the same forever? Also,  we love the whole person, not just the outside. It should be what's inside that matters. I know that sounds cheesy,  but,  it's true. \n\nI don't have enough to comment further but be careful this isn't a red flag. He doesn't get to say what you look like. You do you. If he loves you,  he'll support that x", "NTA, but your husband is. This echos of some insecurity, on his part. I went through the same thing, as you, about 5 years ago (I\u2019m in my early 40s). I bought some colorful makeup and started doing some more elaborate looks. You know what my husband does? He tells me how beautiful I am and how he loves the new looks. Every day it\u2019s \u201cohhh! I love the green eyeshadow\u201d or \u201cwow, that color looks really nice on you\u201d. This is how we are supposed to react to people we love. His issues with makeup is more about him than it is about you. Don\u2019t stop feeling good for yourself.", "NTA as long as you're not dressing up for anyone else except yourself or your husband.

You represent your husband when you go out, and he represents you when he goes out.   You should both feel comfortable with how you are represented.   A marriage is a partnership.
