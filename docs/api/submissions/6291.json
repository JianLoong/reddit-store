She came home around 11 pm, I was at home alone and was extremely tired because of the night before. When she passed through the door she asked me if there was any milk in the house, (Not asking how am I, not even saying hello) I said I didn\u2019t know because I don\u2019t drink milk usually and it\u2019s not something I checked. Then I checked and there was almost no milk in the house. She asked me why I didn\u2019t buy milk knowing she always drinks her coffee with milk. I said I just seen the box, I didn\u2019t check since I don\u2019t drink or use milk and also I didn\u2019t thought that she will came home from a trip and immediately wanting coffee. She told me she had no coffee that day and i said there was no way I would knew that. So, she was yelling this whole time, that wasn\u2019t very unusual of her but then she started telling me that I am a selfish, ungrateful, unthoughtful, worthless human being. Basically a parasite living under her roof. I know it sounds like I am leaving details behind but I am not. She told me all of these things because I forgot to check the milk. She goes on telling me that she does not want to live with me anymore, I should just go and live with my father, that I am a burden to her. \n\nThen today came and I didn\u2019t leave my room, I didn\u2019t even eat or did anything outside of my room. She somehow find another things to yell at me, so she did just that. She saw some pans with black spots under and then just yelled at me, saying the same things she said the night before. I tried to be calm and I even apologized for forgetting but she just gone on and on and on about how I am a worthless parasite who ruined her life.

The fact that you feel guilty is proof of the trauma you've lived. Find somewhere else to live as soon as possible, go absolutely zero contact with her and see a therapist.", "NTA I hope you can move out soon and cut contract with her", "NTA but  leave that house", "NTA. I grew up in a similar situation and no one deserves to be anyone\u2019s emotional punching bag. She clearly has anger issues and blames others instead of seeking solutions. Sadly, sometimes you have to be mean or rude in order to get your point across to really cruel people. For example, my mom only stopped abusing me when I grew big enough to push back and tell her to stop or else. Sometimes you have to push back so they start realizing you aren\u2019t a mat to be walked on.", "You don't need judgement, you need therapy and a way out of living with an abusive person.

Now she's heard you push back. This is a horrible way to live - have you got anywhere else that you can enjoy a happy, peaceful existence? Your mother is pathetic and will die alone; you just told her future. That's on her.", "NTA you\u2019re also not a punching bag.

You were just reacting to her constant abuse and I guess you just snapped. I am sure that she then turned it around to how you told her that she would die alone and completely pushed her behaviour under the rug. The narrative now is how you don't care about her and you won't even care if she dies. DARVO. Read about it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who would want to deal with such a person? Don't let her bully you.", "NTA \n\nDefinitely a harsh statement but totally understandable why you said it. Sounds like your mom stopped growing developmentally after she had you. Her behavior is unpredictable & unacceptable. It sounds like she could use some professional help to deal with her issues. They are HER issues. You shouldn\u2019t be the target of her anger when she can\u2019t deal with life. \n\nGet yourself out of this situation as quickly as you can. It\u2019s not a healthy relationship. You are not the parent & you have no reason to feel guilty. However, I suspect 21 yrs of this kind of relationship has seriously affected your ability to have a \u201chealthy\u201d relationship. You may want to think about getting some professional help for yourself to help get you out of this cycle of emotional abuse with your mom.  Wish you the best!"]}
