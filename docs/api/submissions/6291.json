She came home around 11 pm, I was at home alone and was extremely tired because of the night before. When she passed through the door she asked me if there was any milk in the house, (Not asking how am I, not even saying hello) I said I didn\u2019t know because I don\u2019t drink milk usually and it\u2019s not something I checked. Then I checked and there was almost no milk in the house. She asked me why I didn\u2019t buy milk knowing she always drinks her coffee with milk. I said I just seen the box, I didn\u2019t check since I don\u2019t drink or use milk and also I didn\u2019t thought that she will came home from a trip and immediately wanting coffee. She told me she had no coffee that day and i said there was no way I would knew that. So, she was yelling this whole time, that wasn\u2019t very unusual of her but then she started telling me that I am a selfish, ungrateful, unthoughtful, worthless human being. Basically a parasite living under her roof. I know it sounds like I am leaving details behind but I am not. She told me all of these things because I forgot to check the milk. She goes on telling me that she does not want to live with me anymore, I should just go and live with my father, that I am a burden to her. \n\nThen today came and I didn\u2019t leave my room, I didn\u2019t even eat or did anything outside of my room. She somehow find another things to yell at me, so she did just that. She saw some pans with black spots under and then just yelled at me, saying the same things she said the night before. I tried to be calm and I even apologized for forgetting but she just gone on and on and on about how I am a worthless parasite who ruined her life. So in the end I told her \u201cYou are a extremely pathetic person, you will die alone and I will not buy you a grave\u201d\n\n\nSo as I was saying, this is her habit, this is what she does and I knew that, I knew if i didn\u2019t react to things she said she will be calm down eventually but I couldn\u2019t done it this time. I just wanted to hurt her the way she hurts me, even tho I know this is a wrong thing to do. I just wanted to know if the guilt I feel is valid or not.

I grew up in a similar situation and no one deserves to be anyone\u2019s emotional punching bag. She clearly has anger issues and blames others instead of seeking solutions. Sadly, sometimes you have to be mean or rude in order to get your point across to really cruel people.

Who would want to deal with such a person? Don't let her bully you.", "NTA \n\nDefinitely a harsh statement but totally understandable why you said it. Sounds like your mom stopped growing developmentally after she had you. Her behavior is unpredictable & unacceptable. It sounds like she could use some professional help to deal with her issues. They are HER issues. You shouldn\u2019t be the target of her anger when she can\u2019t deal with life. \n\nGet yourself out of this situation as quickly as you can. It\u2019s not a healthy relationship. You are not the parent & you have no reason to feel guilty. However, I suspect 21 yrs of this kind of relationship has seriously affected your ability to have a \u201chealthy\u201d relationship. You may want to think about getting some professional help for yourself to help get you out of this cycle of emotional abuse with your mom.  Wish you the best!", "Leave already. I don't get it. People get physically abused and will stay and you're just taking mental abuse and staying.", "NTA. This is not a \u201chabit.\u201d Your Mom is taking everything out on you, and as long as you\u2019re living there, you are her handy scapegoat. It\u2019s time to move out. Once you establish a life, then you can choose to limit your contact with her.\n\nThere were times when I was my Mom\u2019s scapegoat.", "You deserve better and you'll find better", "NTA\n\nWhen you get to the point that someone is turning you into a person you don't want to be, it's time to get away from them. I know it's hard because she's your mom, but it would be in your best interest. You need a good 10 year or more break because by then your power dynamic will change and it will be easier for you to not think of her as an authority figure. As long as she's an authority figure to you, you'll be under her thumb. She's abusive, so the sooner you get away from her and allow yourself to heal, the better. She's going to keep you as her personal punching bag for as long as she can away with it. Don't let her.", "My mother was the same way. I was her punching bag and sound board. I had to take it. I had no choice. Until I did. I decided one day, that I am no longer a child and I get to choose who I have in my life. So I went NC. Which means I have no one. My family never took up for me. No matter how bad it was they never protected me from her. My brother didn't live with us. So he never experienced it. He was raised by our \" father\" . But I do have a great husband and 4 amazing kids. Family is who you make it with. Get away from her and make your own family with your boyfriend", "NTA, get out of that house as soon as you can!!", "NTA. Good for you. Yes, you're right that mirroring her behavior isn't healthy, but I think this falls under the category of \"standing up for yourself.\"", "NTA.  What you said was the absolute truth.  When the time comes, don't let her guilt you into being there.  She's obviously abusive and is blaming you for her own choices. \n\n I don't understand her pov,, frankly.  I'm  the single mother of an unplanned son who received no child support for most of his childhood (we had no clue where he was until CSE finally found him) and things certainly would have been easier without him, but my life would have been so much emptier.  That your mother doesn't see that proves she not only doesn't deserve you but that she also deserves to end her days alone.", "NTA- Your mom is abusive. We believe that you aren't levar any details out because this is a very real abusive behavior. Don't feel guilty for how your react after being pushed to your limite. I wish you strengh and a way to get out the house and, please, do theraphy so you can recognize and avoid people like your mom on the future.", "NTA. You need to find any possible way to move out and go NC. You are in an abusive situation. Even if it means signing up to work on an oil rig on the other side of the country, you need to leave.", "NTA. I\u2019d establish NC with her ASAP.", "Yeah I mean it sounds a bit like my mom. Sometimes it's a bit hard to learn to push back. I push back in someways, but in others, my mother something little will send her flying right off the handle and it's scary.", "She's 21. Maybe she doesn't have the means to move out, it's not that easy.", "NTA.  The sooner you can move out and get away from your abusive mother, the better.", "Move out!!!!!!", "maybe go live somewhere else, get a job, get roomates and share an apartment of something like that", "NTA What is she doing is abusive, and she deserves even more than what you said. Parents don't deserve autom\u00e1tico respect and love just because they gave us life.", "NTA.\n\nMy mother behaved just like that.  I fell into the trap of fighting back many times.  I think this behavior is often known as Borderline Personality Disorder.    \n\nA toxic person will drain you emotionally.  It's a cycle of guilt and anger, because society dictates you respect your parents unconditionally.  Don't let this guilt happen.   \n\nI found it best to walk away.   I left home at 18, and never went back.   As an adult, I saw her at holidays and other family gatherings, but I remained detached.   \n\nYou have to take care of you.", "Uhhh...\n\nYou need to move out and go no contact with her. That's abuse.", "NTA\n\nMove out", "NTA. The burden of single motherhood is extremely ugly, and not at all fair to anyone involved. Statistically children that grow up without a father are heavily predisposed to many negative outcomes (the numbers are actually insane). The mother has to carry all of the burden with the help of subsidies, but I can imagine the stress of making the wrong choices early on in their life (often manipulated into them, but that's an aside), and having to deal with the consequences alone, that must take its toll.\n\nRather than find grace to resist against the cruelty of life, it sounds like your mother projected all of that nastiness onto you. You are not responsible for her problems, and she does not necessarily deserve hatred. She needs to stop feeling guilt for where her life went wrong and passing it onto you. That may never happen. Close your heart to it and try to find some compassion for the vestiges of your mother you love while you grow and move on from her.\n\nThe father left a void, he may have been booted out by a crazy spouse, or he could have been the shitty person that really deserves all of the hate here. Life's complicated", "And very abusive  do move out asap and go NC.  Nta", "THIS - your mom seems like she's been a horrible and abusive parent.  You have absolutely nothing to feel guilty about nor apologize for. You just reached the end of your rope. I do hope you'll be able to permanently get away from her soon and then go LC/NC with her.
