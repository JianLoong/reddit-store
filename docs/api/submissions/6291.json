No matter how bad it was they never protected me from her. My brother didn't live with us. So he never experienced it. He was raised by our \" father\" .

That's abuse.", "NTA\n\nMove out", "NTA. The burden of single motherhood is extremely ugly, and not at all fair to anyone involved. Statistically children that grow up without a father are heavily predisposed to many negative outcomes (the numbers are actually insane). The mother has to carry all of the burden with the help of subsidies, but I can imagine the stress of making the wrong choices early on in their life (often manipulated into them, but that's an aside), and having to deal with the consequences alone, that must take its toll.\n\nRather than find grace to resist against the cruelty of life, it sounds like your mother projected all of that nastiness onto you. You are not responsible for her problems, and she does not necessarily deserve hatred. She needs to stop feeling guilt for where her life went wrong and passing it onto you. That may never happen. Close your heart to it and try to find some compassion for the vestiges of your mother you love while you grow and move on from her.\n\nThe father left a void, he may have been booted out by a crazy spouse, or he could have been the shitty person that really deserves all of the hate here.

If you're qualified for a better job but haven't put the effort into looking, get going.\n\nYou're living in a horrible, undermining situation in which you get hurt deeply over and over.  Please start working on getting yourself out of there.", "NTA and please get away even if it's financially hard. You don't even know how profoundly your life will change once you do.", ">I just wanted to know if the guilt I feel is valid or not. I want to be a better person than her and I know mirroring her behavior is not a way to do that.\n\nIs it valid? That's a difficult question I think to answer.\n\nI remember someone describing a therapist speaking about the concept of, \"inappropriate guilt\" i.e. the guilt you feel when you lash out against an abuser or when you cut a toxic element out of your life. It's normal, and even to a certain extent a positive trait as far as pro-social behaviour goes to feel guilt over doing something harsh. However, it needs to be remembered that a person isn't generally saved or damned by a single act and we're allowed some measure of grace in how we respond to extreme behaviour.\n\nYour mother has spent 21 years reminding you about how much she hates you, how she blames you for all of lifes misteps from a guy not giving her a second date to the milk jug being empty. This is a woman who has externalized blame in her life onto you to make herself feel better about her own choices.\n\nIn your case you simply got fed up with her. You aren't blaming her for everything that goes wrong in your life, you're holding her to account for her own actions and how she makes you feel. It's certainly not a \"healthy\" way of dealing with anger, but it's several steps removed from your own behaviour. That you feel guilt over it just means overall you're a better person than her already.\n\nI don't think you're a bad person, but I do recommend finding an out from her life as soon as possible, because someone like her tends to poison people over time. I also recommend perhaps seeking a therapist, one who has experience with parental estrangement and abuse trauma.\n\nNTA", "OP my mom's an abusive prick too and honest advice the abuse doesn't stop until you stand up for yourself. If you're silent and take it, they see it as an invitation to scream more. Like for instance when my mom says shit like why are you so ugly, I tell her it's because she's ugly and she gave birth to me so it isn't really my problem. (I'm not ugly, she just enjoys picking on me) Or I straight up let her know that I'm going NC as soon as my education is over. If your mom hurts you, hurt her back until she's scared to hurt you and stops it.
