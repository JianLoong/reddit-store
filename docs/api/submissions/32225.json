I didn\u2019t want anyone else getting this. It feels like I have the flu. My husband attended the funeral with his sister, brother in law, and his parents. He left the house around 8:45am. He didn\u2019t come home until 8:15pm. I knew a funeral lunch-in and alcohol was going to be involved and sometimes my husband does not know his limit. \n\nAround 4:20pm I called my husband with no answer. Around 6pm I checked my husband\u2019s location. He went back to his sister\u2019s house. Around 7:30 I texted his sister asking her if she could try to take my husband\u2019s car keys off him. At that point I figured he had been drinking for a good while and I didn\u2019t want him driving home. At 7:40 I texted my husband asking him to not come home. My main reasons for not wanting him to come home were drinking and driving and honestly me not feeling up to dealing with a drunk person. I am terribly sick and wanted to get some sleep. My husband has a habit of getting clumsy drunk. He drops things, he trips, he falls, and he\u2019s loud. He also has a habit of rambling every idea that has been brewing in his head for the past week/ month. Negative thoughts come out, sometimes angry thoughts come out. I really didn\u2019t have the energy to deal with it. \n\nWe have a 3 year old toddler that I still had to put to sleep before he got home. I was taking care of our toddler while dealing with this cold and he didn\u2019t think to check in once. I got no response when I called and no response to my text. He finally came home at 8:15pm. He was drunk and blaming me for being upset after he just \u201cburied his grandfather\u201d. For what it\u2019s worth, I wouldn\u2019t say my husband and his grandfather weren\u2019t close, but I\u2019ve only met this man 3 times in the 8 years that I\u2019ve known my husband. Our toddler has only met the man 1 time. I do feel for my husband and anyone who loses a family member. But losing a family member is not an excuse to ditch all responsibilities and drink excessively for an entire day. Unless that family member was extremely close and you don\u2019t expect to get in a car and drive home to a sick family after that day\u2019s worth of drinking.", "created_utc": 1701574360, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189kkqd/aita_for_asking_my_husband_not_to_come_home_after/", "score": 366, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I were you I'd really take a closer look at what it means that you knew from the start that 1) he was going to drink past his limit, and 2) once he'd been drinking he was going to have \"angry thoughts come out.\" Lots of women will tell you their husbands are \"not that bad, he's only like this when he's been drinking.\" When you already know that he's going to drink well past his limit and that you have to brace yourself for him to let his \"angry thoughts\" out on you, that means there's a pattern of behavior here. And it's not healthy for him, it's **really** not healthy for you, and it's damn sure not healthy for your 3yo.", "NTA\n\nYour husband driving drunk tells me that is is perfectly ok with possibly killing someone.\n\nHe is not just an asshole, he is an effing asshole.\n\nAlso your Sil is an asshole for not taking his keys.

Funeral or not, that makes sense. Your husband has a problem with alcohol abuse. It is the behavior after he drinks, and knowing he can be like this, his best option is to stop to not drink at all. You should join Alnon, it is for family members of people who are alcoholics. Sometimes you need to talk about what you go through with someone like this and having other people who have been there can help.", "NTA, why the hell did his family let him drive?

She is in no way lamenting that her husband went to the funeral and was spending the day with family. He is an alcoholic and nasty drunk and she wanted to keep everybody safe and avoid dealing with his drunken self when she didn\u2019t feel well. Driving drunk is unacceptable, as is the nastiness that ensues because you are a drunk with no filter and a mean streak. \n\nOP, look into AlAnon for yourself and take a long, hard think about whether you want to live life with an alcoholic if he chooses not to get the help that he so clearly needs.", "NTA - As someone in recovery, I think that in a few days when you\u2019re feeling better and he isn\u2019t hungover you need to sit him down and have a conversation. Explain how the situation made you feel and what your concerns are without \u201cblaming\u201d. Something like I was so concerned for your safety. You were coming from a funeral and I was worried I could end up going to yours next. I also wasn\u2019t feeling well and taking care of toddler. I felt overwhelmed.

How much energy are you expanding on trying to prevent him (and others- including your 3 year old) from himself? The more energy that you give this situation- the less you have to spend elsewhere. Only you can answer this. \n\nSomeone once asked me the same question about my drug addict family member. It was a jolt to the system.
