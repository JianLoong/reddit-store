You\u2019re punishing one child because her father bought her what she asked for. It doesn\u2019t matter why she asked for those exact presents - it was her birthday and she wants entitled to ask for anything. That\u2019s just what kids do.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that you\u2019ve set this precedent now. You\u2019re holding Mia back to punish her, when it\u2019s not her fault Ava\u2019s dad couldn\u2019t afford presents for her. If you\u2019re so worried about Ava, why didn\u2019t you get her the presents she asked for?", "ESH, of course your daughter didn\u2019t just coincidentally ask for the exact same phone and backpack its deliberate and horribly mean, however I don\u2019t think you can just take her gifts away. I think you need to sit down with her and get to the bottom of this. You can do some awful things to your siblings as part of growing up but there is a cruelty in this that you need to address. \n\nHer gifts have to be returned, I understand the impulse but that isn\u2019t a solution And jumping straight to that makes resolving this more difficult. Talk!", "YTA. I understood that you are try to protect one of your daughters, but You are causing pain the other one and you have no right to take away from her something you don't buy.\nWas her father. You don't know if she doit ok propost or not. Its not her fault you other sister cannot have It because you cannot afort It.", "ESH. And everyone saying YTA has read a million posts with a sibling relationship that can't be repaired because petty competitive things like this never were acknowledged, responded to, or resolved. I think it's important to get to the 'Why' Mia feels this way so y'all can repair and resolve, while the worst teenage years are ahead of you.", "ESH.\n\nIt's clearly not a coincidence that she asked for the same exact phone and backpack right down to the color on each. \n\nBut nobody in this sub is gonna know *for sure without a doubt* if it was malicious, or if she just wanted to copy her sister. You left out all the details about their relationship. \n\nThey're not your items to take away tho. And taking away her way to contact her father is a huge no.\n\nEdited typo.", "NTA", "Ugh.... tough one but YTA. \n\nI totally understand your knee jerk reaction but I think you missed a good teaching moment for both your girls. The first question is why did Mia ask for those specific gifts? The second question is how Ava feels & how she should handle disappointment... Sucks when you see your kids feelings get hurt. You just let your emotions get the better of you. Probably should sit both girls down & have a talk with them.", "Why are you mad at Mia?  Her dad gave her the gifts.  You have no say in taking them away from her.  YTA.", "INFO: How was what she did cruel? She got gifts. Do you know if she did it to spite her sister or?", "YTA- This situation is unfair to Ava, but this is the reality of your daughters having separate dads who will provide for them differently. I\u2019m not sure how you trying to balance the scales in this manner is going to lead to anything other than fueling resentment among everyone across the board.", "NTA. She knows what she did. Purposely being spiteful is not a nice personality trait. Dad will most likely defend her and downplay the incident because his money was at play here. Don\u2019t give in and teach her the important lessons of actions having consequences.", "NTA younger sister was being a nasty brat and needs a discussion about why she chose to deliberately hurt her sister.", "YTA for assuming Mia did this to hurt Ava without giving her the benefit of a conversation. \n\nIn any case, the gifts are not yours to take.", "YTA. Younger siblings can be heavily influenced by older siblings. So, her wanting the same thing as her sister isn\u2019t surprising or shocking. Particularly when it comes to phones. Mia is allowed to want the same things as Ava. And unless you have some evidence, assuming she is being cruel to Ava is BS. You are doing all the things necessary to stroke sibling resentment and for Mia to lack trust in you. Good luck with the HS years because you are going to need it.", "YTA.\n\nSomehow, I get the feeling that both girls don't get along because they're treated differently.\n\n2 kids only 2 two years apart from 2 different fathers says a lot...", "YTA  this are consequences of your actions. You had 2 kids with different dad that are in different financial position. Life isnt fair. Also based on you re replays you re even bigger asshole for not even trying to see the other side. And YTA for not doing anything to make the relationship between your daughter better (i doubt this is first time like).", "Info: why can't Mia get in contact with dad? Is she banned from Zoom or what's app? Both of which have websites? Are you not letting her use your phone?", "YTA - you had no right to take away one daughter\u2019s gifts from her father simply because your other daughter\u2019s father couldn\u2019t afford to get her what he was going to get her. That\u2019s called theft.", "INFO - What was it that Mia did that was cruel? All I read is that she opened her gifts.", "You don\u2019t have any right to take away the gifts Mia\u2019s dad gave her, whether or not she was being spiteful\u2026which is not established. If you feel the need to punish her, choose something else. YTA.\n\nEdited to add: You might want to think about how a family court judge would view your actions, denying your daughter the ability to contact her dad.", "YTA. You absolutely had no right to do that. They're sisters. Seems entirely possible that they would have similar tastes. It even just that the younger one is imitating the older one.", "YTA\n\nI don't care you empathize with your older child, but to be so cruel to your other child is preposterous! You feel that is unjust that Ava did not get her presents and you could not afford to get them for her and you punish your other kid for it?\n\nDid you take a moment ad think maybe they looked together at phones and backpacks, as they are sister and they can both like the same thing?! I have a twin sister and most of the time we would want the same things!\n\nGet over yourself and give your kid back what you have stolen from her!\n\nPS: Good job on showing favorites!", "Info:  Did Mia ask for those gifts knowing Ava had wanted them as well but not able to get them at that time?", "NTA\n\nWhy the hell did she do that??? There was another post in AITA just yesterday where the poster had a sister who copies her every move and buys all the things before her or after her to show her up.\n\nSounds like that other op's sister could have benefited from your tough love. Too bad that post has since been removed. \n\nI think you know at some point you'll need to return her gifts but not before a serious talk about her actions. Get to the bottom of why is she doing it on purpose. Fill dad in on the importance of Mia being her own person instead of being an empty copycat and give her the chance to truly think about what it is that SHE wants instead of just showing up her sister.", "YTA.", "What did you get Mia for her birthday? It sounds like Ava my be your golden child and Mai's left holding the bag. Did you ask Mai's father when she asked for the backpack and phone. Because if it's was when Ava asked , then you are most definitely AH. If it was after she found out Ava couldn't get it's most like she feels unwanted in your household. Especially if your still with Ava's father which it sounds like, than Mia was your mistake which she most definitely picks up on. Try fostering the same amount of love you give your children. Because one day Mia will probably realize her relationship with you and her sister aren't worth it and walks away. YAH", "YTA\n\nHow would the child be cruel and immature? Your behaviour says so much... You're an adult right?", "YTA\n\nI get that this is a shitty situation and you can tell your daughter what you think of her actions and maybe get your other daughter another gift. But you cannot take away something that her father gifted her. He doesn't  have to take your other child's father's finances into consideration when buying his own child a gift. It would have been nice, but that's not his responsibility.", "YTA\n\nI agree that what Mia did was obviously cruel and malicious, but I don't think what you did made anything better, in fact it made it all much worse. Punishments are supposed to teach children how what they did was wrong, they aren't supposed to be for revenge on the child or spiteful, which is what this was.\n\nChildren emulate their parents and based on this post, Mia gets it from you. You can't teach a child not to be mean spirited by being mean spirited to them. If you can't see that then its because you are unable to be objective and are judging others by their actions but yourself by your intentions. It reminds me of my friend who always overreacts and yells about small things her children do wrong, then complains that her children have short tempers and yell.\n\nYou say Mia has completely different tastes and actually wouldn't like the phone or the backpack. Well, you should have forced her to use them then, for X months. No other bags allowed to take to school and no phone cases that disguise the phone colour. \n\nIn the mean time, give Ava some extra time and attention because that is free. Maybe take a day to go into all the charity shops with her and see if any bags there take her fancy. Let her talk to you about her feelings without Mia around.", "NTA - I would have a real conversation with Mia when I gave the stuff back to her. She very well may have done that on purpose, but she isn\u2019t considering the ramifications of hurting her sister. She didn\u2019t win. Her sister won\u2019t trust her. That\u2019s the kind of thing that festers. When Mia needs Ava she might not have her if a bunch of these slights and resentments build up.", "More info needed: Are you sure Mia didn\u2019t just copy her older sister rather than try be spiteful? it\u2019s VERY common to do that. As a third sibling I copied my brothers all the time but if it was to be spiteful NTA", "YTA\n\nCongrats,you just showed your favoritism. You know very well in advance what kind of gift one daughter is getting and expecting. You don't have a clue what your second daughter getting until you see it on her birthday and you successfully took back the gift she got just because her half sister didn't get it.\n\n\nYour argument is like this\nA random guy in USA bought latest version of iPhone this year just because he want to shame another random person in Europe who can't able to afford it. He got it because it's famous and in demand \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.", "YTA", "ESH...You can't take gifts from her father away, legally.  It wss shitty she requested the exact same things, but she also can't be punished for Ava's dad having financial trouble.", "It seems to me that Ava is a really great, wonderful, sensitive young girl, with enough compassion to get, at her young age, that he father was sick and understood why she couldnt get her gifts, and enough maturity to withdraw herself from the party to process the shitty thing her sister did to her instead of throwing a fit, or even saying something and ruining the mood.\n\n\nSound like you, your other baby daddy, and Mia could all learn a thing or two from her.\n\nESH", "This ones a hard one...From your previous responses it seems like your younger daughter did it out of spite which is definitely not ok..I'm hanna go NTA on this as it was done maliciously", "After mia got her presents..You should\u2019ve just bought ava her stuff even if it put you in a hole for a month or two", "YTA\n\nPunishing one daughter because her father can do more for her than your other daughter's father can do for his kid is going to breed resentment of the one daughter towards her sibling and towards you.\n\nThis reminds me of another AITA post where parent's told their younger daughter she could not move up a grade because she was gifted due to the fact it would embarrass her brother who was in the grade above her.\n\nIf one daughter's father could pay for her to attend an ivy league school that both girls dreamed about, but the other kid's father couldn't afford anything more than community college, would you tell the more privileged daughter \"too bad, it's community college for you?\"\n\nAlso, even if the sister was being malicious in asking for the same exact things (which I do doubt because more often than not a sibling will see their sibling with something and think it's cool and then want that too) it doesn't justify taking away something that her other parent gave her. He is her parent too and he has rights in the parenting decisions as well.", "ESH, except for Ava. \n\nMia sucks for taking advantage of her father\u2019s wealth to make her sister upset.\n\nHer father sucks for not parenting his daughter better than that and not caring about why even after knowing. \n\nYou suck the most for not properly parenting both of your children, allowing money to drive a wedge between them, and having a shitty coparenting relationship with Mia\u2019s father. \n\nSounds like you have a better relationship with Ava\u2019s father than Mia\u2019s and are letting it influence your attitude with your children, who are noticing.", "Yta....wait until she goes NC at 18 and wants to live with daddy", "YTA \n\nYou punished Mia because her dad is in a better financial position than Ava\u2019s dad. That\u2019s kinda shitty.", "YTA. What they both deal with with their own dads is their business. Taking things from one child just because you and the other kids dad can't afford it is hardly fair to the other Chile OR their parent.\n\nWhat's next if you can't afford a trip.to Disney then your daughter can't go with her dad?", "I'm a bit torn... So I'll go with ESH. I can see why you would be upset at the fact that one asked for something that she wanted but didn't get, and the other got *the exact thing* she wanted because her dad was better off.\n\nThat being said... You aren't 100% entitled to take her gifts away because the other girl felt upset about it. I get why she felt that way, but that's not your place. They're gifts from her DAD, not YOU. \n\nIf it bothers you that much, why not talk? If you think it was maliciously done, though... Well, that's a different topic.", "YTA for taking the presents away because you didn't pay for them. \n\nFrom some of your responses it sounds like your youngest did do this on purpose if they're not her normal tastes. What you should have done is sat her down and told that you're disappointed that she would intentionally pick items for her birthday that she knows her sister wanted and couldn't have and find out why she felt the need to do so.\n\nIs it because she wants to emulate her sister? Is it because she feels like her sister is the golden child? why do they not get along? You really need to get to the crux of the problem.", "YTA", "this is incredibly disgusting, YTA, not only that, it is also theft, its person A gift to person B, you don't exist in this transaction, it either belongs to person A or person B, if anyone else take it its theft clear and simple.\n\nthis is terrible parenting.\nactually you know what, its not even parenting.", "OP said she couldn\u2019t afford to give Ava the gifts, either.", "Why do the gifts have to be returned? Second daughter shouldn\u2019t be punished because first daughters dad can\u2019t afford it.

Not that having sex with 2 different men 2 years apart is even anything major...", "What exactly does it say?", "Yep.", "Stop shaming her - 2 different partners in 2 years is not a lot.", "It says a lot about you alright.", "It's not theft.

This could teach her to be her own individual instead of focusing on how to be cruel to her sister. NTA", "Mia asked for the exact gifts (down to style and color) that Ava wanted.  Ava was unable to get them due to her dad not being able to afford them due to medical expenses.", "Yes", "Ava is 2 years older than Mia. It is very unlikely OP and Ava's father are still together.", "No I punished her because she asked for those gifts to make her sister upset", "I think returned to the daughter", "I get what he's saying, especially from a reaction like that. It looks like she *expects* both dads to be parenting both kids even though they have no obligation or reason to. Not necessarily because she had 2 kids but from her way of treating them", "It's not about slut-shaming. She could have had sex with 20 or 200 men that I would have the same answer : choosing to have 2 kids from 2 different men in 2 years is a lot and shows a lot of immaturity.", "Hvaing 2 kids from 2 differents partners in 2 years is a lot.", "NTA - that was deliberate. I think a lot of the other replies are missing this point. If you can edit your post to include this, it would be most helpful in giving accurate judgement.\n\nThe Y T A replies are caught up in the money aspect but this is really the dynamics between the two girls with one deliberately being vindictive with her choices. You're trying your best to nip resentments in the bud, because one is trying to lord her gifts over the other one which is total mean girl energy. A conversation needs to be had about the shady one's behaviour and there needs to be consequences because if she carries this forward in life, she'll be an unpleasant person.", "NTA then that was cruel of her.

A lot of people I know have same/similar items to mine because a lot of things like phones don't offer many colors (most let you choose from like black, white, gray, gold sometimes blue and pink and that's it).

Sure, she needs to have a conversation with her daughter, but that doesn't make her the ah for coming here to ask for advice first. Second child is clearly taking cues from her equally cruel father and I don't think OP is going to have much of a chance of helping second daughter to become a good person with her ah of a father influencing her. \n\nI had an evil stepmom and stepbrother. This story dredges up so many awful memories that still haunt me 20 years later (my dad paid for all living expenses at the country club, so my stepmom used her income exclusively on her son while my mom and I lived in a trailer park). OP does need to have a sensible conversation, just in case she can make a difference, but at this age the damage may already be done until second child has a rock bottom experience and gets therapy. \n\nNipping this kind of cruelty (either sociopathy or borderline sociopathy) in the bud has to happen at 4 or 5 yrs old.

Teenagers, man.", "No, the problem isn't that he didn't know before buying the gifts, the problem is that he knows NOW why she chose the items and he doesn't care", "I don\u2019t think the dad should be raising his daughter in a vacuum though. The fact is Mia lives with her sister and should be raised in a way that reflects she has a sibling. (Im assuming OP has majority custody of them both.) raising two kids who live together in different ways because they have different dads is a recipe for disaster. Not saying the dads should have to consult on all presents though Tbf. But I do think the kids as a collective should be first priority.", "Nice gifts sure.  Gifts to be spiteful to her sister no.\n\nLike I said in previous comments it\u2019s not the fact it\u2019s more expensive it\u2019s the fact it was the exact same gifts.  I\u2019d hope I\u2019d taught my daughter to treat her sister nicely and not to mean.", "Did you not read the story\u2026. \n\nSHE. LITERALLY. ASKED. FOR. THE. GIFT. TO. BE. SPITEFUL.\n\ngetting excepted into a good college is not equal to purposeful trying to signal (not that this is the case) that one dad loves his daughter more than the other loves his daughter.", "Uh, like if second daughter intentionally uses her father's privilege to get accepted into first daughter's dream school so she can rub it in her underprivileged sister's face? (That would be the equivalent here, and yes, my god that would make her a super ah)\n\nYour logic is unsound if we're just talking about pure qualifications. Because OPs story is about her second child's vindictive and cruel nature first and foremost, not so much about the two fathers' different circumstances.", "Again... Mia is definitely on the wrong path if she chose to intentionally hurt her sister. That\u2019s an entirely separate issue. The gifts are not the problem, Mia\u2019s choices are. Address the problem. Taking away the gifts does NOT solve the problem.", "You can\u2019t look inside your daughters brain and know that she absolutely doesn\u2019t actually want those gifts. It\u2019s not uncommon for teenagers to want the same thing. Also does it really matter what her intention was ? Those gifts are not your property, if you really don\u2019t want her to have them all you can do is ask her to keep them at her dads house. I\u2019d imagine if you\u2019d do that she would probably resent you and prefer to stay with her father(if she doesn\u2019t already).I mean considering you have already stolen gifts that her father gave her she probably already does resent you so at this point what difference would it make ? YTA return the property that is not yours.", "You know, if Mia was old enough to comprehend what Ava was doing then it only makes what Ava did worse because a young child is at a very sensitive point of emotional development so Ava's actions were a source of lasting trauma for Mia.\n\nIt is horrendous parenting for you to expect Mia to just suck it up and move on, she needs help, Mia is ~~asking~~ acting out in the form of vengeful acts because nothing was ever done to correct the hurt she experienced because of Ava's actions. Mia is hurt because of Ava so she is hurting Ava back, the way you're dealing with it is not helping either one of them. They need therapy, Mia needs it to heal from that childhood trauma, Ava needs it so she can truly comprehend how wrong what she did to Mia was. When they both deal with the source of the problem, they can then apologize to each other and everyone can heal.\n\nYou need to stop taking one side and fairly parent both your kids.", "Ahhh so Mia is resentful of Ava because of how she treated her in the past.  That must've really hurt her a lot. Has Ava ever addressed her past behavior or tried to apologize?", "LOL.. please read slow so you understand.. the VICTIM has EVERY right NOT to forgive.. the culprit HAS to make ammends AND appologies.. they MAY or MAY Not be forgiven.. It does not MATTER that both where kids .. because it HURTS THE F... SAME!... forgiving can NEVER be ordered. She used her ONLY birthday wish.. because she hurts that much..  if you want to make that right make your older daughter give her the gifts back and ask her to appologoies... \"I know you did that because I hurt you bad, when we where younger.. I AM truly sry .. please I wont be mad, that you asked for the same stuff then me.. i guess I deserved it ... are we ok now?\" ... THAT is how it is done! If you EVER want peace between the too of them your older daughter need to makes amends.. because you younger one and her pain is not getting seen", "Did you correct Ava when she was little? Also sounds like Ava is actually learning an important lesson. She will now know to never hurt someone with something like this because it can be done to her. The tables have now turned and she is in an even worse position than Mia was.", "Really then, both girls suck and will probably never talk to each other once they leave the house.  \n\nESH", "And did you ever do anything to Ava when they were younger and she was being I had a dad and you don\u2019t ha ha or did you ignore that and only care now that it\u2019s reversed", "this is really sad. Ava is being hurt in her own home. ESH except Ava", "Phone down to style and color maybe a coincidence but agreed on backpack.  I\u2019d be so shocked at daughter\u2019s behavior if I was the dad.  I\u2019d be asking why instead of yelling at the mom.\n\nFor how mom handled it again agreed tough.   She should be able to communicate with her dad.  With a gift that was meant to be cruel just seems wrong.", "I'm not defending him, but he probably sees this as the mother's problem, not his. She is the one who chose to have 2 children close in age by different fathers. And it really is her problem. Her daughters obviously don't like each other and they should be in therapy with the mom. Taking away gifts isn't the solution.", "Agreed because right now they are on track to not talking anymore as adults.", "so if Daddy wants to buy Myia a car for her Sweet 16 he shouldn't because Ava's dad couldn't afford to buy one for her when she turned 16?  If Myia wants a new tablet, no go because AVA's dad can't afford to buy her one? HIS kid shouldn't get stuff because her half-sister's dad is a deadbeat?   Yeah, talk about recipe for disaster....", "You re assuming stuff. Many teenagers copy their elder siblings. I copied mine\u2026also if you re a girl and a teenager theres like 80% chance the phone you want is pink/rose gold Iphone? \ud83d\ude02", "The gifts and the motivation for requesting the gifts are inextricably linked. OP is addressing the problem, which includes appropriate punishment/ redress.", "Why is parents always forget that it hurts just as much, if not more when bad / mean stuff happens when you are a child?  I'm sure Ava didn't just \"sort of\" brag about gifts, there are probably deeper layers to it.  Mia just understands that revenge is a dish best served cold, and she's getting her revenge.", "Of course I corrected her but she was just a kid and it wasn't as bad as what Mia is doing", "are you sure you have the names right?"]}
