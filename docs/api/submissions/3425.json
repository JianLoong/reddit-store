You\u2019re punishing one child because her father bought her what she asked for. It doesn\u2019t matter why she asked for those exact presents - it was her birthday and she wants entitled to ask for anything. That\u2019s just what kids do.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that you\u2019ve set this precedent now. You\u2019re holding Mia back to punish her, when it\u2019s not her fault Ava\u2019s dad couldn\u2019t afford presents for her. If you\u2019re so worried about Ava, why didn\u2019t you get her the presents she asked for?", "ESH, of course your daughter didn\u2019t just coincidentally ask for the exact same phone and backpack its deliberate and horribly mean, however I don\u2019t think you can just take her gifts away. I think you need to sit down with her and get to the bottom of this. You can do some awful things to your siblings as part of growing up but there is a cruelty in this that you need to address. \n\nHer gifts have to be returned, I understand the impulse but that isn\u2019t a solution And jumping straight to that makes resolving this more difficult. Talk!", "YTA. I understood that you are try to protect one of your daughters, but You are causing pain the other one and you have no right to take away from her something you don't buy.\nWas her father. You don't know if she doit ok propost or not. Its not her fault you other sister cannot have It because you cannot afort It.", "ESH. And everyone saying YTA has read a million posts with a sibling relationship that can't be repaired because petty competitive things like this never were acknowledged, responded to, or resolved. I think it's important to get to the 'Why' Mia feels this way so y'all can repair and resolve, while the worst teenage years are ahead of you.\n\nEdit: OP is TA. I don't think you realize Mia was traumatized, younger doesn't mean less vulnerable. You created a dynamic where one sister hurting  another to feel empowered is allowed and another is punished. That's weird and wrong. If you don't want a NC future you need to course correct immediately, take accountability and Apologize.", "ESH.\n\nIt's clearly not a coincidence that she asked for the same exact phone and backpack right down to the color on each. \n\nBut nobody in this sub is gonna know *for sure without a doubt* if it was malicious, or if she just wanted to copy her sister. You left out all the details about their relationship. \n\nThey're not your items to take away tho. And taking away her way to contact her father is a huge no.\n\nEdited typo.", "NTA", "Ugh.... tough one but YTA. \n\nI totally understand your knee jerk reaction but I think you missed a good teaching moment for both your girls. The first question is why did Mia ask for those specific gifts? The second question is how Ava feels & how she should handle disappointment... Sucks when you see your kids feelings get hurt. You just let your emotions get the better of you. Probably should sit both girls down & have a talk with them.", "Why are you mad at Mia?  Her dad gave her the gifts.  You have no say in taking them away from her.  YTA.", "INFO: How was what she did cruel? She got gifts. Do you know if she did it to spite her sister or?", "YTA- This situation is unfair to Ava, but this is the reality of your daughters having separate dads who will provide for them differently. I\u2019m not sure how you trying to balance the scales in this manner is going to lead to anything other than fueling resentment among everyone across the board.", "NTA. She knows what she did. Purposely being spiteful is not a nice personality trait. Dad will most likely defend her and downplay the incident because his money was at play here. Don\u2019t give in and teach her the important lessons of actions having consequences.", "NTA younger sister was being a nasty brat and needs a discussion about why she chose to deliberately hurt her sister.", "YTA for assuming Mia did this to hurt Ava without giving her the benefit of a conversation. \n\nIn any case, the gifts are not yours to take.\n\nEdited to add: I read your comments. Particularly the one where you state that Ava used to brag about having a father while Mia didn't have hers around; and the part where you don't mention ever disciplining Ava for this behaviour. Mia acts out once - allegedly, I'm still not convinced she did this to be vindictive- and you take away her birthday presents on her actual birthday. It seems you are taking your dislike for Mia's dad out on her; too bad, you picked him. Do better.", "YTA. Younger siblings can be heavily influenced by older siblings. So, her wanting the same thing as her sister isn\u2019t surprising or shocking. Particularly when it comes to phones. Mia is allowed to want the same things as Ava. And unless you have some evidence, assuming she is being cruel to Ava is BS. You are doing all the things necessary to stroke sibling resentment and for Mia to lack trust in you. Good luck with the HS years because you are going to need it.", "YTA.\n\nSomehow, I get the feeling that both girls don't get along because they're treated differently.\n\n2 kids only 2 two years apart from 2 different fathers says a lot...", "YTA  this are consequences of your actions. You had 2 kids with different dad that are in different financial position. Life isnt fair. Also based on you re replays you re even bigger asshole for not even trying to see the other side. And YTA for not doing anything to make the relationship between your daughter better (i doubt this is first time like).", "Info: why can't Mia get in contact with dad? Is she banned from Zoom or what's app? Both of which have websites? Are you not letting her use your phone?", "YTA - you had no right to take away one daughter\u2019s gifts from her father simply because your other daughter\u2019s father couldn\u2019t afford to get her what he was going to get her. That\u2019s called theft.", "INFO - What was it that Mia did that was cruel? All I read is that she opened her gifts.", "You don\u2019t have any right to take away the gifts Mia\u2019s dad gave her, whether or not she was being spiteful\u2026which is not established. If you feel the need to punish her, choose something else. YTA.\n\nEdited to add: You might want to think about how a family court judge would view your actions, denying your daughter the ability to contact her dad.", "YTA. You absolutely had no right to do that. They're sisters. Seems entirely possible that they would have similar tastes. It even just that the younger one is imitating the older one.", "YTA\n\nI don't care you empathize with your older child, but to be so cruel to your other child is preposterous! You feel that is unjust that Ava did not get her presents and you could not afford to get them for her and you punish your other kid for it?\n\nDid you take a moment ad think maybe they looked together at phones and backpacks, as they are sister and they can both like the same thing?! I have a twin sister and most of the time we would want the same things!\n\nGet over yourself and give your kid back what you have stolen from her!\n\nPS: Good job on showing favorites!", "Info:  Did Mia ask for those gifts knowing Ava had wanted them as well but not able to get them at that time?", "NTA\n\nWhy the hell did she do that??? There was another post in AITA just yesterday where the poster had a sister who copies her every move and buys all the things before her or after her to show her up.\n\nSounds like that other op's sister could have benefited from your tough love. Too bad that post has since been removed. \n\nI think you know at some point you'll need to return her gifts but not before a serious talk about her actions. Get to the bottom of why is she doing it on purpose. Fill dad in on the importance of Mia being her own person instead of being an empty copycat and give her the chance to truly think about what it is that SHE wants instead of just showing up her sister.", "YTA.", "OP -When they were kids Mia's dad wasn't in her life and Ava sort of, bragged about things that her dad bought for her. Eversince her dad came in her life she has used every opportunity to make Ava upset. I had multiple xonversations with her and told her she needs to stop acying like this. They were little kids back then but they are teenagers now she shouldn't be holding such a grudge but nothing I told her had any effect on her\n\nWhat did you get Mia for her birthday? It sounds like Ava my be your golden child and Mai's left holding the bag. Did you ask Mai's father when she asked for the backpack and phone. Because if it's was when Ava asked , then you are most definitely AH. If it was after she found out Ava couldn't get it's most like she feels unwanted in your household. Especially if your still with Ava's father which it sounds like, than Mia was your mistake which she most definitely picks up on. Try fostering the same amount of love you give your children. Because one day Mia will probably realize her relationship with you and her sister aren't worth it and walks away. YAH\n\nEdit to add OP's comment", "YTA\n\nHow would the child be cruel and immature? Your behaviour says so much... You're an adult right?", "YTA\n\nI get that this is a shitty situation and you can tell your daughter what you think of her actions and maybe get your other daughter another gift. But you cannot take away something that her father gifted her. He doesn't  have to take your other child's father's finances into consideration when buying his own child a gift. It would have been nice, but that's not his responsibility.", "YTA\n\nI agree that what Mia did was obviously cruel and malicious, but I don't think what you did made anything better, in fact it made it all much worse. Punishments are supposed to teach children how what they did was wrong, they aren't supposed to be for revenge on the child or spiteful, which is what this was.\n\nChildren emulate their parents and based on this post, Mia gets it from you. You can't teach a child not to be mean spirited by being mean spirited to them. If you can't see that then its because you are unable to be objective and are judging others by their actions but yourself by your intentions. It reminds me of my friend who always overreacts and yells about small things her children do wrong, then complains that her children have short tempers and yell.\n\nYou say Mia has completely different tastes and actually wouldn't like the phone or the backpack. Well, you should have forced her to use them then, for X months. No other bags allowed to take to school and no phone cases that disguise the phone colour. \n\nIn the mean time, give Ava some extra time and attention because that is free. Maybe take a day to go into all the charity shops with her and see if any bags there take her fancy. Let her talk to you about her feelings without Mia around.", "NTA - I would have a real conversation with Mia when I gave the stuff back to her. She very well may have done that on purpose, but she isn\u2019t considering the ramifications of hurting her sister. She didn\u2019t win. Her sister won\u2019t trust her. That\u2019s the kind of thing that festers. When Mia needs Ava she might not have her if a bunch of these slights and resentments build up.", "More info needed: Are you sure Mia didn\u2019t just copy her older sister rather than try be spiteful? it\u2019s VERY common to do that. As a third sibling I copied my brothers all the time but if it was to be spiteful NTA", "YTA\n\nCongrats,you just showed your favoritism. You know very well in advance what kind of gift one daughter is getting and expecting. You don't have a clue what your second daughter getting until you see it on her birthday and you successfully took back the gift she got just because her half sister didn't get it.\n\n\nYour argument is like this\nA random guy in USA bought latest version of iPhone this year just because he want to shame another random person in Europe who can't able to afford it. He got it because it's famous and in demand \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.", "YTA", "ESH...You can't take gifts from her father away, legally.  It wss shitty she requested the exact same things, but she also can't be punished for Ava's dad having financial trouble.", "It seems to me that Ava is a really great, wonderful, sensitive young girl, with enough compassion to get, at her young age, that her father was sick and understand why she couldnt get her gifts, and enough maturity to withdraw herself from the party to process the shitty thing her sister did to her instead of throwing a fit, or even saying something and ruining the mood.\n\n\nSound like you, your other baby daddy, and Mia could all learn a thing or two from her.\n\nESH\n\nEdit : just saw op's comment, if ava did that as a KID (like 4-5 yo) and has since grown up and apologized THEN i still think she is great NOW, we all did stupid shit as children. If i had put YTA i would now change as ESH, but ESH is already what i said so I guess no change is needed here", "This ones a hard one...From your previous responses it seems like your younger daughter did it out of spite which is definitely not ok..I'm hanna go NTA on this as it was done maliciously", "After mia got her presents..You should\u2019ve just bought ava her stuff even if it put you in a hole for a month or two", "YTA\n\nPunishing one daughter because her father can do more for her than your other daughter's father can do for his kid is going to breed resentment of the one daughter towards her sibling and towards you.\n\nThis reminds me of another AITA post where parent's told their younger daughter she could not move up a grade because she was gifted due to the fact it would embarrass her brother who was in the grade above her.\n\nIf one daughter's father could pay for her to attend an ivy league school that both girls dreamed about, but the other kid's father couldn't afford anything more than community college, would you tell the more privileged daughter \"too bad, it's community college for you?\"\n\nAlso, even if the sister was being malicious in asking for the same exact things (which I do doubt because more often than not a sibling will see their sibling with something and think it's cool and then want that too) it doesn't justify taking away something that her other parent gave her. He is her parent too and he has rights in the parenting decisions as well.", "ESH, except for Ava. \n\nMia sucks for taking advantage of her father\u2019s wealth to make her sister upset.\n\nHer father sucks for not parenting his daughter better than that and not caring about why even after knowing. \n\nYou suck the most for not properly parenting both of your children, allowing money to drive a wedge between them, and having a shitty coparenting relationship with Mia\u2019s father. \n\nSounds like you have a better relationship with Ava\u2019s father than Mia\u2019s and are letting it influence your attitude with your children, who are noticing.", "Yta....wait until she goes NC at 18 and wants to live with daddy", "YTA \n\nYou punished Mia because her dad is in a better financial position than Ava\u2019s dad. That\u2019s kinda shitty.", "YTA. What they both deal with with their own dads is their business. Taking things from one child just because you and the other kids dad can't afford it is hardly fair to the other Chile OR their parent.\n\nWhat's next if you can't afford a trip.to Disney then your daughter can't go with her dad?", "I'm a bit torn... So I'll go with ESH. I can see why you would be upset at the fact that one asked for something that she wanted but didn't get, and the other got *the exact thing* she wanted because her dad was better off.\n\nThat being said... You aren't 100% entitled to take her gifts away because the other girl felt upset about it. I get why she felt that way, but that's not your place. They're gifts from her DAD, not YOU. \n\nIf it bothers you that much, why not talk? If you think it was maliciously done, though... Well, that's a different topic.\n\nEdit: To save time... 1: My comment on the malicious part was written before OP stated the presents were asked specifically. My bad for assuming otherwise.\n2: I still stand by ESH", "YTA for taking the presents away because you didn't pay for them. \n\nFrom some of your responses it sounds like your youngest did do this on purpose if they're not her normal tastes. What you should have done is sat her down and told that you're disappointed that she would intentionally pick items for her birthday that she knows her sister wanted and couldn't have and find out why she felt the need to do so.\n\nIs it because she wants to emulate her sister? Is it because she feels like her sister is the golden child? why do they not get along? You really need to get to the crux of the problem.", "YTA", "this is incredibly disgusting, YTA, not only that, it is also theft, its person A gift to person B, you don't exist in this transaction, it either belongs to person A or person B, if anyone else take it its theft clear and simple.\n\nthis is terrible parenting.\nactually you know what, its not even parenting.", "OP said she couldn\u2019t afford to give Ava the gifts, either.", "Why do the gifts have to be returned?

She could have had sex with 20 or 200 men that I would have the same answer : choosing to have 2 kids from 2 different men in 2 years is a lot and shows a lot of immaturity.", "Hvaing 2 kids from 2 differents partners in 2 years is a lot.", "NTA - that was deliberate. I think a lot of the other replies are missing this point. If you can edit your post to include this, it would be most helpful in giving accurate judgement.\n\nThe Y T A replies are caught up in the money aspect but this is really the dynamics between the two girls with one deliberately being vindictive with her choices. You're trying your best to nip resentments in the bud, because one is trying to lord her gifts over the other one which is total mean girl energy. A conversation needs to be had about the shady one's behaviour and there needs to be consequences because if she carries this forward in life, she'll be an unpleasant person.", "NTA then that was cruel of her.

The dad is quite deliberately encouraging this behavior and doesn't seem to care that his daughter has become a total mean girl. Let him deal with the consequences. The best way to protect Ava would be to remove her tormentor from the home. Dad obviously had a big hand in creating the monstrous behavior so he can deal with caging it too. I'm sure OP probably feels like she'd be losing a custody battle or abandoning a child if she sent Mia to her dad, but that's not the case. This would be OP's CHOICE and she'd be sending Mia to dad's where she already spends part of her time, in order to protect an innocent. The calculation that went into that birthday debacle is stunning, and obviously required the ex's support to pull off. He knew his tomboy daughter didn't want those gifts for herself and had to know what she was planning and why.

It isn't about the best or most expensive gift, it is that younger daughter made a deliberate choice to request gifts that would hurt her older sister. That needs to be addressed.

It is not automatically bad parenting to take away possessions as a form of punishment (and is very common). \n\nThe amount of people you annoy with your actions is immaterial here. We don't develop ethical theory by majority rule.

Without knowing your kids its hard to know their dynamic, but based on the current info at hand it seems like Mia is seeking revenge for something and is being vindictive.  I'd speak to both kids and try to find a compromise somewhere.
