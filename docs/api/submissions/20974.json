They ruined some of my plants, pulled up my raised bed (it was empty but still not the point), and are using our garden as a storage area for their wood and metal and broken concrete meanwhile their garden is PRISTINE. I kept quiet about this at first as we barely use the garden but when I did mention it all she had to say was \"well the landlord was aware we're doing it\".\n\nThey have now went on to message the landlord about dog poo in our garden. The dog poops 4 times a day maximum, and every night I take it down the street to the nearest dog bin so there is never more than a day's worth at a time. They talked to my landlord and even my MUM, but never directly to me or my partner. The closest we've got to that is when I hear them talking about us over the fence thinking I couldn't hear. The dog always poops in the same spot, which is well over 6ft away from the space they're working. Yet they've chosen to store wood, metal and concrete basically right in the middle of our garden and then complain about what's on there. This is our private back garden, not at all in view of the street or where anyone would usually see. We have a 2 month old baby, I'm studying and working part time and my partner works full time so we are busy people.
