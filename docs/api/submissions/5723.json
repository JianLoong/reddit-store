One of the things that came out of the discussion was an inside joke about a hypothetical \u201ccontract\u201d that would in theory contain everything we agreed on and was signed by us both. The contract contained a section on not having kids.\n\nWe got engaged 2 years ago and are planning our wedding. When we got engaged her parents assumed that we would start trying for a baby (tradition in their family is to have a child after getting engaged so that the kid can be at the wedding). We told them we will not be doing that and they were not happy.\n\nSo one night when we had been drinking, her mother called us to try and convince us to have a kid. My gf, drunk, answered the phone and argued back which is not something we usually do. She for some reason brought up the \u201ccontract\u201d and either forgot that it didn\u2019t actually exists or thought it would be funny to pretend that it was real and legally binding. So she told her mother \u201cunfortunately we signed a contract forbidding us from having children. Take it up with the lawyers.\u201d And hung up. I thought it was hilarious and we both forgot about it the next day.\n\nWell her parents must have remembered because they turned up at our house demanding to see the contract and wanted a contact number for the lawyers my gf had mentioned on the phone. Obviously we didn\u2019t have lawyers but we decided we would type up a quick contract, sign it, scan it in and send it to them to see if it would finally shut them up. It didn\u2019t make them any less mad but now they pester us about nullifying the contract instead of our sex lives so that\u2019s a win in our book.\n\nWe were briefly at their house over the holidays but we were only there to drop off presents. We knew we would get questions about children in the 40 minutes we were there so my gf suggested we print out copies of the contract and hand it out to everyone that asked. Again I thought this was really funny so we did. And it worked because once people realised that the contract was the only response they were going to get no one said anything about it to us and we left without an argument for once.\n\nThe next day we woke up to literally hundreds of messages and calls from my gf\u2019s whole extended family calling us immature, disgusting, insane and other hateful messages, we are used to it by this point and just found it funny and ignored them. However when I brought it up to my friends as a funny story rather a lot of them sided with my gf\u2019s family and said it was too far and not funny. So AITA?\n\n(Note: we had tried other methods of getting them to leave us alone)", "created_utc": 1672098479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw0nf3/aita_for_handing_out_the_contract_me_and_my_gf/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People were asking about something that is not their business, you responded with humor. In my book, that\u2019s a win.\n\nI feel bad for your fianc\u00e9e. Frankly, are you sure you both want people in your life that call you immature, disgusting, and insane?", "NTA. Her parents should mind their own business instead of unhealthily obsessing over whether you two are having enough unprotected sex to placate them.\n\nMy only criticism is that you could have required that they sign a non-disclosure agreement before showing them the contract.", "NTA. Her parents frankly need to grow up and stop forcing you to have a child just so they can be grandparents.\n\nPS. The response of actually writing a contract was pretty good though lol...", "NTA and y\u2019all are hilarious. Good on you.", "lol, NTA.  I'm going to write a contract too, lol", "When I read the title I thought maybe T A and you\u2019re both being petty but definitely not! \n\nFar out -the pressure to have kids in the family! Imagine if you wanted kids and had fertility issues! It\u2019d be everyone\u2019s business.. \n\nDefinitely NTA", "NTA- It's bloody brilliant!\n\nI wish I had thought of it for the years I was asked this!\n\nIt's downright rude to be asking people when they are having kids. It's no-one's business if/when they choose to have them or not!", "It isn\u2019t even her parents\u2019 place to start demanding that you start trying for children. Is her mother going to carry the baby for nine months? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nI would have told them whether there was a contract or not, it wouldn\u2019t be any of their business anyway because who fucking cares. At this point, you and your fianc\u00e9 can threaten to file a restraining order since this has crossed the line into legitimate harassment.\n\nOh, and don\u2019t invite these assholes to your wedding. They will morph it into an issue about this and demolish your wedding day. That\u2019s what toxic family members do. Everything is all about them and what they want. They have no concern for your wishes or you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. They shouldn\u2019t have asked in the first place.  And your gf\u2019s family tradition is weird.  Do they put off weddings if they experience infertility?", "NTA. For all your in-laws know, either of you could have fertility problems. \nWhy do parents think they are entitled to grandchildren? It\u2019s your choice on whether you want to be responsible for another human for at least 18 years, not theirs.", "NTA they are asking questions that are non of their business! You got them to stop. You could've done worse like waaayyy worse", "NTA, do you know what\u2019s going to far?  People pestering you about reproduction and not letting it go.", "\u201cunfortunately we signed a contract forbidding us from having children. Take it up with the lawyers.\u201d\n\nDude I snorted out my drink reading this. \ud83d\ude02 Definitely NTA. You two are adult enough to make your own decisions. If you don't want children then you don't want children. Simple as that.", "NTA and yeah, I laughed.", "NTA - this is funny and I hope you guys have a great life because you both sound on the same page. It\u2019s kinda gross they\u2019re putting so much emphasis on if you consummate for children over both of you having a good relationship. \n\nThe only people that are TA are your family that decided to actually be immature and berated you over this as well as your friends that also seem to have the same issue as them.", "NTA. Having kids or not is a personal preference between 2 people. While I understand the family\u2019s excitement for potentially new children in the family it is honestly none of their business what happens in your bedroom. \n\nI had kind of the same situation with my in laws about questions about where is the babies??? My wife and I had our daughter after a few years of marriage and then had 4 miscarriages in a row. It took a toll on us and agreed to not have anymore children and she got the birth control shot which I think is good for like 5 years. The first few years of not having anymore kids we joked about it saying that we didn\u2019t know how and asked them to show us. Then after 1-2 miscarriages we would get offended and tell them to stay out of our sex life and it wasn\u2019t their business. Finally once we were both over 36 years old and came to the conclusion that we couldn\u2019t have anymore we would explicitly tell then the details of the miscarriages and how bad it hurts to have to explain it to them. If they tried to stop us we would power through them and fully describe how much it hurts us and that if they really needed that much personal information. Naturally they say no. Then I ask them why so many personal questions and why they don\u2019t want to know the truth.", "NTA. At all. This is brilliant and hilarious and the exact type of response that intrusive questions like this deserve. Also; is her family a cult? This is a really weird tradition and they seem super sensitive about it. Like way too sensitive.", "NTA, not even a little bit. People really need to stop meddling. The decision to have children or not is really important and also private. You discussed this between the two of you, and you agreed on no kids. THE END.", "NTA it\u2019s a brilliant way to fight back and set your boundaries. Meddling people don\u2019t like being told no or to be reprimanded or outsmarted. All three apply to your contract. \n\nThey\u2019re all wrong to expect you to do things the way they want you to just because it\u2019s some odd family tradition. You shouldn\u2019t have to have kids at all, and if you do want them, it\u2019s your decision and on your timeline. No one else\u2019s.", "NTA- families need to stop asking those questions. My husband and I have been married 5 years (together for 10) trust me when I say it doesn\u2019t let up with family members meddling in. I am at the point where if my distant relatives (whom haven\u2019t spoken to me since I was 5) ask me when I\u2019m having kids, I will flat out make them uncomfortable by saying \u201cwow, well ya know what I can\u2019t have kids.. but thanks for bringing up such a sensitive issue\u201d\u2026. Just to teach them a lesson.", "NTA, love it!!!", "NTA: Funny solution to a infuriating problem. Much better solution then a acquaintance of mine did, his solution was basically tell the in laws the next time they brought up having a child would be the last time they would talk to them, mind you that was after months of the in-laws pestering them to start trying for a kid they did not want.", "NTA - If you ever need someone to be your fake lawyer and inform them that it's an unbreakable contract let me know.", "NTA! \nIt is literally NONE of their business and, frankly, just weird! Nothing wrong with your response, they asked, and you both answered.", "Lol NTA that's hilarious!!", "Overall: NTA. Could also go everyone sucks, but your point was made pretty clear. You told them from the beginning you weren\u2019t having kids, they essentially pushed you into coming up with this contract to begin with. Gotta say, it\u2019s genius.", "Not the asshole its your guys choice what you do with your lives. shouldn't need a contract it should be what ever happens, happens and thats it .fuck all of them. Its none of their buisness do what makes you guys happy. They will have to accept it and be happy before they loose their daughter to their bullshit", "NTA for your decision or for the contract.  Will both be TA if you don't learn to put your foot down with nosy/controlling family.  \"We don't want to. Our decision, not yours. Full stop.\"", "NTA but they need to mind their business. No need to be so gentle about it though.", "NTA. At all.\n\nPeople need to get their minds out of your gfs uterus. Seriously.  It's no one's business what goes on in there but yours (with her consent) and hers, everyone else can fuck off. \n\nThis is probably the best, least confrontational way I've seen this handled, so props to you.\n\nWhen I was engaged to my (biologically male) ex fiancee, I started telling people i was infertile (I'm not, but I am on meds that make pregnancy dangerous) to get people to back off with their incessant, invasive questions.\n\nYou both handled this way better than I did.", "> The next day we woke up to literally hundreds of messages and calls from my gf\u2019s whole extended family calling us immature, disgusting, insane and other hateful messages\n\nWrite a new contract that says if they do behaviour like this that you can fine them or something. That should really grind their gears haha.\n\nNTA", "I think it\u2019s funny. NTA. People need to learn to mind their own business.", "Sounds funny to me. NTA By what twisted logic would this hurt anybody, giving them a right to object?", "You're kinda the AH, but I wholeheartedly approve. This is hilarious and a brilliant way to handle people pestering you about having kids. Thanks for the laugh!\n\nEdit: Actually, changed my mind. NTA. This is just too good.", "I read another post about someone giving them a jar when asked about getting married or having children. Lol. If thet ask, they need to pay a dollar. Lol it shuts them up. I think I would start doing that as well.\n\nNTA. A bit overboard but still not the asshole.", "NTA. You should not have needed to go that far.", "NTA really funny response to outrageous demands from your future in-laws. No one gets to decide about the if and when of kids but you and ur gf.", "NTA. This is hilarious and I wish my husband and I had done something like that when we got engaged.\nHaving or not having children is nobody's business but yours. If they can't let it go that's on them.", "NTA. Gf\u2019s family completely missed the joke and doubled down on their interference in your private life. So keep going - send back replies along the lines of \u2018thank you for your kind message, but as this is a legal matter, all communications must be directed to our attorney\u2019. Hell, get a fake email and voicemail set up and watch the crazy unfold.", "A+ on your writing assignment. I was with you until you mentioned a tradition of having a kid after you get engaged so the kid can be at the wedding. That\u2019s too good.", "NTA. \n\nI don't think that contract or taking that contract out makes you and your gf assholes.\n\nBut I must admit, I think it makes you both look like huge loosers. I'm all aboard on the no children thing, but a written contract? \nIf talking to those people about it doesn't make them stop, then just stop spending time with them.", "NTA as a judgement, but this was an ass move.  BUT just cause you are being an ass doesn't mean you are in the wrong or that this isn't hilarious.  Fucking well done, I want kids but I don't believe in trying to change someone's mind on this subject (which had lead to breakups and failed dates aplenty) and I hate when people actually try to change others' minds on this subject.  I've had conversations with people on the subject in which we all explain our positions and discuss the weaknesses in the other side.
