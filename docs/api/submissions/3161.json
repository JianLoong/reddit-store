It\u2019s NASTY when you\u2019ve got someone changing a diaper in the living room. \n\nYWNBTA if you tell her to please change the diaper on the changing table. Kiddo can bring a toy during the change. Besides, it\u2019s way harder on your back to change a diaper on the floor than a changing table. \n\nAlso, is she constantly changing diapers when she comes over or something? How old are the kiddos? How long do they stay?", "NTA, tell her either to follow the rules of your house or to stay away. What she's doing is not hygenic and in most cases stinky. Also if anything gets onto the carpets, it will stink and will take more time to clean. So get the nappies changed in its designated spot or she and kids can stay away until they are potty trained. Also don't see why your kids need to be inconvenienced for no fault of theirs.", "100% NTA \n\nThere\u2019s a million better alternatives to the living room and it\u2019s your house, she doesn\u2019t pay the bills", "YWNBTA. The carpeted living room is not the place to change a diaper. If your sister-in-law wants to change her children in her own living room then she\u2019s free to do so. But it\u2019s presumptuous of her to insist on changing her children in your living room when you offered her a proper (private) place.", "Info: have you asked her to only use the changing table or are you just gonna immediately ban her?", "NTA. You've given her many appropriate alternatives. Her reasoning doesn't make any sense. Her kid is missing nothing and it's disrupting play for the other kids. Also, it's your home and it's rude of her to persist in doing this when you've asked her to do it elsewhere.", "NTA\n\nIt would be different if this were an emergency with no other place but given that there is a private space that is actually set up as a changing station, you can certainly ask her to change diapers there.\n\nI don't have especially delicate sensibilities but I wouldn't want someone changing a diaper in my living room since there are convenient options - actually more convenient than the floor.", "NTA, not whatsoever. It's unhygienic and probably stinky as heck. \n\nThe kids can miss out for 3 minutes while they're being changed in another room. It won't hurt them.", "It's literally your home and she's being inconsiderate. NTA.", "NTA. Changing her diaper on the floor is unsanitary. It's best that she do it in the bathroom so that way she can have the tools she needs to clean it up.", "NAH as long as you\u2019re not rude about it. A simple \u201cWe\u2019d prefer you use the changing table for all future diaper changes\u201d instead of ASKING her why she\u2019s using the living room should hopefully yield a better response.", "NTA. Your house your rules.\nYou offered her a perfect alternative so Idk what her problem is.", "NTA. It's your house, your rules", "NTA", "NTA it's disgusting and should be done in the bathroom, like anything else faeces related.", "Nta\n\nJust don't be rude about it but your house your rules", ">I\u2019ve asked her why she does it there and offered the changing table, but she says she doesn\u2019t want the kids to miss out on what\u2019s going on around them\u2026\n\nHow long does it take her to change a diaper?\n\nThe kids miss what, a few minutes?  They will be fine!\n\nYWNBTA", "Nah, I don't think there's anything wrong with her changing a diaper on the living room floor in general, but it's your house and you have a preference for her to do so in another room on the change table and that's perfectly fair.\n\nWe always asked the host where we could change diapers for our kids when out visiting since that just seems more respectful. I think you need to word it differently though, it sounds like your SIL doesn't realize you have a problem with where she's changing them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How exactly will you be enforcing a ban?", "NTA then. Not justifying her behaviour, but it feels like it\u2019s less that she doesn\u2019t want her kids to miss out on what\u2019s going on and more that ***she*** doesn\u2019t want to miss out if she has to go out of the room to change a diaper.", "Ah then NTA", "Well then tell her that she needs to use it.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, you wouldn't be the arse and I would really not want someone changing a diaper in my living room.", "Not allowing her to come over with her kids unless she changes them in a different room.
