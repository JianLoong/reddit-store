It\u2019s NASTY when you\u2019ve got someone changing a diaper in the living room. \n\nYWNBTA if you tell her to please change the diaper on the changing table. Kiddo can bring a toy during the change. Besides, it\u2019s way harder on your back to change a diaper on the floor than a changing table. \n\nAlso, is she constantly changing diapers when she comes over or something? How old are the kiddos? How long do they stay?\n\nEdit: Even LESS of an AH is that OP kept the changing table specifically for her use. You\u2019re a gem!", "NTA, tell her either to follow the rules of your house or to stay away. What she's doing is not hygenic and in most cases stinky. Also if anything gets onto the carpets, it will stink and will take more time to clean. So get the nappies changed in its designated spot or she and kids can stay away until they are potty trained. Also don't see why your kids need to be inconvenienced for no fault of theirs.", "100% NTA \n\nThere\u2019s a million better alternatives to the living room and it\u2019s your house, she doesn\u2019t pay the bills", "YWNBTA. The carpeted living room is not the place to change a diaper. If your sister-in-law wants to change her children in her own living room then she\u2019s free to do so.

You've given her many appropriate alternatives. Her reasoning doesn't make any sense. Her kid is missing nothing and it's disrupting play for the other kids. Also, it's your home and it's rude of her to persist in doing this when you've asked her to do it elsewhere.", "NTA\n\nIt would be different if this were an emergency with no other place but given that there is a private space that is actually set up as a changing station, you can certainly ask her to change diapers there.\n\nI don't have especially delicate sensibilities but I wouldn't want someone changing a diaper in my living room since there are convenient options - actually more convenient than the floor.", "NTA, not whatsoever. It's unhygienic and probably stinky as heck. \n\nThe kids can miss out for 3 minutes while they're being changed in another room. It won't hurt them.", "It's literally your home and she's being inconsiderate. NTA.", "NTA. Changing her diaper on the floor is unsanitary. It's best that she do it in the bathroom so that way she can have the tools she needs to clean it up.", "NAH as long as you\u2019re not rude about it.

How exactly will you be enforcing a ban?", "NTA then.

Explain each item, bucket to keep stuff together, drop cloth blue , plastic large paint size to lay down first, dog poop bags for used diapers, some form of air freshener and hand sanitizer for Mom and child after change.

But as he\u2019s gotten older (like almost a year) I struggle to take him upstairs as he will fight his way out each time w everyone cause he likes to be his independent self  \n\nBut when I change him, and not just me but MIL and his mom, we wipe down the area he was changed on and I also try to make sure the smell isn\u2019t in the air either by opening a window or using a spray because yeah it\u2019s a little yucky but at the same time it\u2019s convenient for us and the child because he will fight to stand up when laying down", "I feel like most people would take the suggestion to use the changing table as the host actually preferring that they be changed on the changing table. Weird flex to insist on staying in the living room.", "Why is this getting downvoted? \nHer children won't be missing much if she changes them elsewhere.", "She should definitely be using the changing table for the 2 year old, but she's changing a kindergarten age kid in your living room? \n\nThat's old enough to at least use pull ups with assistance in the bathroom/wiping their own bottom.", "Maybe just have less play dates too.", "NTA. She is showing off that she can do what she wants in your house", "Wait??! Her 4 year old is still in diapers? Are there developmental issues? If not, this is really concerning.", "Totally okay to set a boundary. Rather than seeing it as banning her, I would approach it this way:\n\n\u201c(Husband) and I talked and we really want to have a designated area, away from the living room and kitchen, for diaper changes in the house. It seems like the changing table hasn\u2019t been working for you where it is. I know you said you don\u2019t want your kids to miss out on anything, can you tell me more about that so we can come up with some options together?\u201d\n\nThat is less likely to trigger defensiveness, and may help reveal some underlying concern she hasn\u2019t been able to recognize or share.\n\nMaybe her kids have some developmental struggles and meltdown if she tries to take them somewhere else, or fight a diaper change if they don\u2019t have other nearby distracting them. Maybe she feels guilty about how much play time they get and doesn\u2019t want to \u201cmake\u201d then miss one second.\n\nIt could be something that seems ridiculous, but the more questions you can ask before sharing your reaction to her answers, the better you can look for a solution other than banning her.\n\nIf it does finally come down to that, you can say something like, \u201cI am so sorry the other changing options we have don\u2019t work for you. It\u2019s important to us to avoid diaper changes in the living room and kitchen, but it\u2019s also important to me that the kids and I get play date time with you. Can we figure out some play date spots together so can still make that happen?\u201d\n\nBut do that with the knowledge that it may cause harm to the relationship and end cousin play dates. Sadly some people aren\u2019t ready for boundaries, and will cut ties when you set them, so it\u2019s important to be okay with that possibility and know that not having diapers changed there is more important.\n\nIt\u2019s not really about whether or not you would be the A. The respectful thing is to ask someone where they\u2019d like you to change diapers, throw away soiled diapers, etc. You have a very reasonable expectation. It\u2019s about whether it matters enough to you that you\u2019ll be okay with fallout if setting that boundary doesn\u2019t go well.\n\nHope that\u2019s helpful!", "She didn\u2019t say that, just that the kids are 4 and 2 \u2014 it\u2019s the 2 year old who\u2019s in the diapers", "\"with her two kids, both in diapers\"", "INFO: Is your changing table actually big enough for her kids to use safely?", "Uhm it is gross to change diaper in the middle of the living room.

If they don\u2019t want to miss out they need to use the potty like their cousins. Be firm & tell her she will absolutely not be changing her kids & putting them on display in your living room.

The *only* reason I am willing to have the changing table in our carpeted bedroom is because I freaking hate that carpet and it was already scheduled for the axe. You need to be able to clean up afterwards, and getting baby poop out of carpet is.... not fun.", "INFO - is the 4-year-old dealing with some sort of disability?
