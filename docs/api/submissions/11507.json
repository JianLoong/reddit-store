I (38 f) spent the last two decades struggling but I'd never regret the life I made. I have a gf I love they don't acknowledge and I am happy except when my parents reach out to play mind games. We have been no contact off and on for years.\n\nLast month my aunt called me frantically because my parents were reported to Adult Protective Services due to their neglected health and the state of their house (hoarder level 6/10). I drive across several states in time to sign power of attorney and handle their affairs. I keep them from being committed and separated until the APS case is resolved. After getting them settled in rehab, I have >60 days to fix the home. I review their accounts and learn my parents are rich. This is a shock because they live very cheap lives from the outside. Yet their hoarding pile was tons of brand new electronics in the box with plastic cover, flat screens, laptops, expensive tools and they donate $800 a week to their cult religion. \n\nI'm their only child and I've struggled for years and they never offered me help. To put it in perspective, they assumed I was homeless last year and didn't feel inspired to help me. Sorting through their excess is gross.\n\nThey are diagnosed with dementia, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease. My dad told me to my face, \"I'm going to spend all my money before I die. You won't get a dime.\" He was furious when he signed that power of attorney because he dislikes me greatly. However, he currently needs an advocate who can make financial decisions while he's in a facility. He was resentful about it. My point of view was it's their poor decisions that created this situation and this is the way the cookie crumbles. \n\nThey called the cult church people in secret. The church lawyer tried to sneak a notary public into the hospital to help my parents to sign a new power of attorney. The new POA would transfer all assets immediately, legally absolve them from consequences and allow them to forgo their heir. My parents were actively trying to find a way to give their fortune away while I'm renovating their home for their return. I found out via the nurses who shoo'd the church people out the door before anything was signed. This is how I learned their church was run by literal scammers. The POA agreement from the church was written by a lawyer who was formally reprimanded by the state bar for mishandling an estate in 2021. I learned the church elder called APS and they were the ones behind getting my parents committed in the first place! The people they trusted were the ones who created this situation.\n\nAITA if I just walk away? Do I keep setting this up for these people who never cared anything for me?", "created_utc": 1677985981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ilwea/aita_for_leaving_my_abusive_parents_in_a_home/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, if they\u2019ve literally got dementia, a home is the best place for them anyways and then signing something new could be voided due to incompetence. Leave them where they are and just make sure they are cared for until they die. Imo you\u2019re kinda owed their fortune after they die as they sound abusive.  Definitely go through their hoard though in case there\u2019s a will.

You could continue helping, or you could walk, and no one should fault you for doing either.\n\nOnly help as much as you can tolerate, and then get the hell back out of there.", "NTA. Take care of yourself. Sometimes people who don't want our help shouldn't get it.", "NTA If you think you can manage to get some of that fortune when they're gone by sticking around and that the payoff will be worth it, do so, but if not, you owe them nothing.

It\u2019s a little odd that you were okay until things got even weirder, since the new info is they\u2019re being scammed, not something relevant to your relationship with them. \n\nBut NTA for washing your hands of them. They made their bed.", "NTA\n\n\nFile a lawsuit against the crunch for being a scam and put that fake lawyer in jail. They will try and get to parents all the time.

They're actively being exploited by that church and you're the only one trying to help them despite their abuse. You absolutely are in the right here.\n\nI'm generally not a fan of dropping a \"you owe \\_\\_\\_ nothing\" as a blanket statement but in this case you absolutely owe them nothing, and they owe you everything.

I didn't know my parents had money until I got involved, after I was power of attorney for a few weeks. I only wanted POA to pay their mortgage and access their accounts but then I found all the church checks and it honestly turned into a True Crime mystery. I was willing to walk away beforehand but this church is the root of a lot of the homophobia in my life. My parents are horrible but churches that pray on sick old people are evil. I'm not a Christian but I know Jesus would not be pleased. But now that the church part is resolved, I'm still dealing with my parents every day and it's a lot of stress daily.

Of course you can just walk away right now. \n\nAnyways, you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA in my opinion and I am very sorry for the way your family treated you.\n\nYou could just walk away. Let them get screwed by their cult and get sent to some state-run crappy home.\n\nAnother thing you can try is to just take over their finances and state, run their lives and let them hate you for taking care of them. Use their money to do so and inherit whatever is left when they are gone.", "NTA. They've shown you who they are.  Just leave your contact information with the home and walk away.", "NTA  \nyour parents aren't worth  the energy of beating yourself up.  whatever you decide, do it for your peace.", "The money isn't yours, and never will be if your parents disowned you; it's of no matter. \n\nThe only thing that's worthy of consideration is how you personally would feel about it.

The church lawyer tried to sneak a notary public into the hospital to help my parents to sign a new power of attorney. \n\nHow shortly after you signing for the POA did this happen?\n\nThe point of my asking is simple. This isn't a conservatorship, it's a Power of Attorney.\n\nThis means you're only responsible for managing their affairs, so if your parents wish to revoke your power of attorney and assign it to another individual, **they don't need your permission** and moreover *you have zero say in it.*\n\nAdditionally, the hospital blocking access to an attorney, whether they are the devil incarnate or not, is illegal.\n\nUnless you're prepared to fight this, which you'd have zero grounds to stand on, you have no cause to stay.\n\nBasically YWNBTA if you just handed over control to the church and walked away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
