I\u2019m not going to try and guess how much of Joshua\u2019s behavior/immaturity is his ADHD and how much is because of my grandparents\u2019 parenting, as I know I\u2019m not qualified to comment on it.)\n\nMy grandma had a medical procedure during Christmas Break. Since my grandfather and parents were going as well to support her (the medical facility was about a two-hour drive away) they asked me to watch Joshua during this time. They just said that they would feel more at ease knowing that if anything happened to either of us, there\u2019s another person nearby.\n\nBeing in charge of Joshua was like babysitting a small child; Joshua put a frozen pizza in the oven and left it to burn for almost three hours until I smelt it. He did the same thing later that night with cornbread. (He set an alarm for himself yet kept hitting snooze because he didn\u2019t want to pause GTA.) I caught him trying to order fireworks online through my grandfather\u2019s computer. He tried to ride my dad\u2019s motorcycle to 7-11 despite being unlicensed. I got woken up twice by Joshua because he was trying to break into my grandparents\u2019 liquor cabinet. When my parents and grandparents came back, they were upset at me that Joshua didn\u2019t do his school assignments and claimed they expected me to hover over him so that he would do them. I wasn\u2019t able to get any of my own schoolwork done because I was constantly having to chase after Joshua.\n\nDuring the week, my grandparents and Joshua came over for dinner. This time, my grandparents and parents explained that they wanted to go on a vacation over Spring Break and tried convincing me to stay with Joshua again. I told them that if they want me to babysit Joshua then they need to pay me a full rate. My parents immediately said that my word choice of \u201cbabysit\u201d was unnecessarily rude because Joshua\u2019s almost sixteen and I came across as condescending and a jerk to him. I told them that it honestly is babysitting. Joshua is immature and I do have to treat him as if he\u2019s a small child. My parents pulled me aside and told me to help my grandparents because they have gone through a lot and they want to do something nice because they haven\u2019t gone on a vacation in years and you never know when you won\u2019t be able to anymore. I told my parents that I\u2019m not stopping them; I just want to be fairly compensated for my time if I\u2019m tasked with being in charge of Joshua.\n\nMy parents grounded me for the night, so I explained to my friends why I had to cancel plans. Most of my friends agree my request for compensation was fair. But about three said that my grandparents deserve to be able to go out and enjoy life because they gave up their relaxation years to raise Joshua and I should help them so they can have some of the fun times that they deserve.
