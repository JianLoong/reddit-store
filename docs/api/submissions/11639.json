I was OK with this and he seemed fine too. But when the time actually came and we went to bed he seemed really uncomfortable and tense. Like he kept tossing and turning and trying to make conversation which was terribly awkward. \n\nAt one point I told him that I\u2019d like to fall asleep now and he said OK. But he kept fidgeting and I was so tired from the day so it was just annoying. So I decided to grab some blankets and told him that I\u2019ll sleep outside. He said that it\u2019s not a good idea and I told him I\u2019d rather get a good nights sleep. \n\nWe started arguing-whispering in the dark and I told him to sleep outside so it works out for everyone. He was unhappy with this and told me I can\u2019t just kick him out. I told him then I\u2019d do it but he didn\u2019t want this either?? At this point I was truly fed up and I asked him to offer solutions. He ultimately went to sleep outside. In the morning I woke up and he was in the tent with me but grumbled that he just came in the morning. \n\nI felt energised and well rested but he looked super disheveled and you could tell he didn\u2019t sleep at all. Now he just keeps giving me weird glances and seems annoyed. \n\nWhen our friends found out what happened they called me \u201cmean\u201d for making him sleep outside and that we could\u2019ve solved the issue differently. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1678115293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k1bry/aita_for_telling_my_guy_friend_to_sleep_outside/", "score": 513, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then again where i live thats a super dangerous thing to do, so it made sense to me that to keep her safe he left.\n\nSafety should always be prioritized over comfort when camping.
