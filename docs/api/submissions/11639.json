{"id": 11639, "submission_id": "11k1bry", "title": "AITA for telling my guy friend to sleep outside the tent?", "selftext": "I (F23) recently went on a camping trip with three other friends (my guy friend Theo and two others, guy and girl). \n\nAt first I shared a tent with my female friend but after a few days she and the other guy decided they wanted to share one instead. \n\nSo Theo and I ended up sharing a tent. I was OK with this and he seemed fine too. But when the time actually came and we went to bed he seemed really uncomfortable and tense. Like he kept tossing and turning and trying to make conversation which was terribly awkward. \n\nAt one point I told him that I\u2019d like to fall asleep now and he said OK. But he kept fidgeting and I was so tired from the day so it was just annoying. So I decided to grab some blankets and told him that I\u2019ll sleep outside. He said that it\u2019s not a good idea and I told him I\u2019d rather get a good nights sleep. \n\nWe started arguing-whispering in the dark and I told him to sleep outside so it works out for everyone. He was unhappy with this and told me I can\u2019t just kick him out. I told him then I\u2019d do it but he didn\u2019t want this either?? At this point I was truly fed up and I asked him to offer solutions. He ultimately went to sleep outside. In the morning I woke up and he was in the tent with me but grumbled that he just came in the morning. \n\nI felt energised and well rested but he looked super disheveled and you could tell he didn\u2019t sleep at all. Now he just keeps giving me weird glances and seems annoyed. \n\nWhen our friends found out what happened they called me \u201cmean\u201d for making him sleep outside and that we could\u2019ve solved the issue differently. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1678115293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k1bry/aita_for_telling_my_guy_friend_to_sleep_outside/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, I think your friend did you dirty by tenting up with the other guy mid trip. You agreed to arrangements based on the tents being separated by gender. Not cool of her.", "INFO: Was everyone except you expecting you to have sex with Theo?", "NTA. You did offer to sleep outside, he declined, you offered for him to sleep outside, he declined, well, what else were you supposed to do?\n\nAlso, yes, it's weird that he kept trying to talk to you well past the \"sleeping\" time, methinks both him and the other couple were expecting the two of you to hook up or something, and he wasn't sure what to do when you were completely unresponsive to his advances.", "INFO\n\nyou do realize that the other guy and the other girl were purposefully trying to hook you up with Theo...right?\n\nAnd the reason he was fidgeting and super anxious was because they had been hyping him up to make a move but he was too afraid to make said move.  That is also why he didn't want you sleeping outside and why he didn't want to sleep outside.  Its also why he came back in the tent.\n\nThis was a setup", "I dont think you're the AH, but was there not a car around? I've slept in the car before when the tent situation wasn't working out. Idk maybe an idea for next time.", "NTA, I think your friends are also to blame for putting you both in a tough spot, esp since your original sleeping plans were changed and you\u2019ve never slept in the same \u201croom\u201d as this person before. They shouldn\u2019t call you mean for also being the ones that made the situation happen in the first place. You offered to sleep outside but he wanted to do the \u201cgentleman\u201d thing and take your place, it ended up being his choice, but maybe he expected you to change your mind and invite him back in? Or it could have been a \u201cwingman\u201d scenario, where he expected a different outcome and that is why he is a grumpy the next morning?? Either way \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. You offered to sleep outside the tent. He stopped you and decided to do it himself. His choices are not your fault.", "NAH, the fault is with the organizers. The only thing I do feel is that he didn't really have a choice about  sleeping outside.\nSure, he could have taken up you on your offer, but there would be consequences socially.\n\nCount you have tried talking to other people before it came down to sleeping outside?\n\nThe situation isn't your fault and remind theo of that.", "NTA, but neither is he in my opinion. I think the real AHs here are the other guy and girl who suddenly decided to share a tent without considering you and putting you both 8n a difficult situation.\n\nThey can't call you out when they did this.", "From your account, you offered to go and sleep outside. Your problem was that the guy, for whatever reason, wouldn't stay still. Sounds like all this is on him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He was given three different options, and chose the one that involved sleeping outside. Aaaaand now I\u2019m just figuring out why the other guy switched tents\u2026He wanted some peace and quiet too.", "NTA", "NTA. But if it was me after you said I go sleep outside I would say - go", "NTA because he literally chose to sleep outside instead of you sleeping outside.", "NAH - but you should all have separate tents if sleeping next to other folk might be a problem for any one of you. Like, I'm a light sleeper and need my space, so I ensure I have it (or, ensure I have headphones to block out snoring or whatever). What was the different solution your friends came up that you could have done?", "I initially thought YTA when I started reading, however if you own the tent and had physically told him you wanted to sleep and he carried on talking then you were well within your right to ask him to sleep outside. \nI do kind of feel like if it was a decision based just on the basis of \u2018fidgeting\u2019 maybe it was a little harsh? Tents are soo hard to sleep in as is, it\u2019s easier said than done just to lay down and immediately be comfortable enough to sleep.", "INFO. Did you actually intend to sleep outside or were hoping he would volunteer.", "This wasn\u2019t handled great but it sounds like your guy friend made his own bed and chose not to sleep in it. So I\u2019m going with a soft NTA", "Nta.", "YTA.\n\nWhat you gave him was the illusion of choice and you know it. Few men would call a woman on her bluff and let them sleep outside.", "YTA. Why did you need to wait for a man's permission to sleep outside? Because you never intended to. He was fidgeting and it was bothering you so you brought up sleeping outside and then waited until he slept outside, had you had the intention to sleep outside you would have done it, however you didn't but you were ok sending him out.", "YTA - You bullied him into leaving the tent by threatening to sleep outside if he didn't. Societal expectations are that a man would be an asshole if he \"forced\" you to sleep outside and you used this to his advantage to manipulate him into leaving the tent.", "ESH - if you are a light sleeper and have a problem with the sound of people moving in a sleeping bag, bring a battery powered fan or white noise machine or your own tent or you sleep outside instead of demanding he sleeps outside.  It\u2019s your problem, not his.  His problem was he should of told you to go f yourself and you sleep outside instead of just bending and going outside.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hell u ever try and find a rock free space to curl up alone in the dark? Trying to avoid plopping down on an ant hill when u r trying not to wake others?

If you're trying to sleep and someone won't shut tf up after being asked. Then you say you'll just sleep outside and they say no, and it goes on until you tell them to get out. Chances are a woman would say okay leave when the person says they'll sleep outside. Genders doesn't change anything other than maybe the decisions made", "She was not uncomfortable with him in the tent per se, she was just annoyed the guy wouldn't shut up so she offered three solutions. She sleeps outside, he sleeps outside, he shuts up. 2 out of 3 options did NOT include him sleeping outside, so its completly on him to choose this option. She didn't kicked him out at all. He could have just shut up, be quiet and both sleep in the tent.", "Yeah it definitely cam across as your \"friend\" trying to set you up. But the dude wasn't sure how to approach this since you clearly just wanted to go to sleep. \n\nFriend is not your friend.", "Then why was he so nervous/figity? Does he have a thing for you? Why couldn't he shut up and go to sleep?", "Yes, but this is the implication. If he had refused to leave the tent would he have been accused of being a sexual predator? You put him in an impossible situation.   He had no choice to leave even though he clearly didn't want to.", "OP says once she said she wanted to go to sleep he was fidgeting. If OP ever actually intended to sleep outside she would have done it notbwaited for his permission to do it, she instead waited until he left the tent.", "Because she didn't do it. Why did she sit and argue with him about it if she was going to go out? She was so tired that instead of getting out of the tent, she whispered with him until he got out. Why did she need to wait for his permission? She seems like an independent woman fully capable of making her own decisions. If someone says let me help you pick that up and then proceeds to stand there and wait for you to pick it up yourself, are you going to think they are helping?", "It clearly was a bluff.
