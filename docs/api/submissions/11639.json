I was OK with this and he seemed fine too. But when the time actually came and we went to bed he seemed really uncomfortable and tense. Like he kept tossing and turning and trying to make conversation which was terribly awkward. \n\nAt one point I told him that I\u2019d like to fall asleep now and he said OK. But he kept fidgeting and I was so tired from the day so it was just annoying. So I decided to grab some blankets and told him that I\u2019ll sleep outside. He said that it\u2019s not a good idea and I told him I\u2019d rather get a good nights sleep. \n\nWe started arguing-whispering in the dark and I told him to sleep outside so it works out for everyone. He was unhappy with this and told me I can\u2019t just kick him out. I told him then I\u2019d do it but he didn\u2019t want this either?? At this point I was truly fed up and I asked him to offer solutions. He ultimately went to sleep outside. In the morning I woke up and he was in the tent with me but grumbled that he just came in the morning. \n\nI felt energised and well rested but he looked super disheveled and you could tell he didn\u2019t sleep at all. Now he just keeps giving me weird glances and seems annoyed. \n\nWhen our friends found out what happened they called me \u201cmean\u201d for making him sleep outside and that we could\u2019ve solved the issue differently. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1678115293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k1bry/aita_for_telling_my_guy_friend_to_sleep_outside/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then again where i live thats a super dangerous thing to do, so it made sense to me that to keep her safe he left.\n\nSafety should always be prioritized over comfort when camping.

Also OP said that after she told him she wanted to sleep he stopped talking.", "I actually spoke to him about this and he said that Theo was definitely not behaving like that when they shared a tent\n\nEdit; his words were that Theo fell asleep \u201calmost instantly\u201d and slept \u201clike a rock\u201d", "No, I believe that there were literally a guy and girl who stated they wanted to sleep together, and it\u2019s just as likely they were the ones wanting to fuck", "I think it had to do with the other two wanting to get it on.", "You literally just lied, op said she wasn\u2019t leaving the tent for show not that she was.", "You were in the tent at night time, you are most guys type at that moment.", "What he said, according to OP, was that it \u201cwasn\u2019t a good idea\u201d. Which is absolutely correct, sleeping outside with zero shelter is not a good idea unless absolutely needed.", "And talked to Theo about it? Anyway, I am kind of suspecting he is shy and scared sleeping in the same tent with a girl and/or has a crush on you", ">So I decided to grab some blankets and told him that I\u2019ll sleep outside.

She said she wants to sleep out side he says that's not a good idea.  she leaves out all the intervening stuff and skips to her telling him to sleep outside so it works out for everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople do this all the time.  \"I don't like current situation so I'm going to do fairly unreasonable thing.\"  \"You can't do fairly unreasonable thing it's fairly unreasonable.\"  \"Well then you come up with a solution.\"\n\nIf she had just gone out and slept outside their would be no issue.\n\nProblem is I doubt she actually genuinely truly wanted the outcome to be \"I sleep outside to accommodate my own discomfort.\"", "He could\u2019ve been just as fidiget y in the other tent, but the other person didn\u2019t have as big of an issue with it, or at the very least, and just bring it up outside of the tent", "Source: made it up", "Also, yes, it's weird that he kept trying to talk to you well past the \"sleeping\" time, methinks both him.", "He stopped you and decided to do it himself.", "You're making assumptions about what his type is. OP might not fit any of the criteria for his type, we don't know, it's not our business.", "That is an extremely sexist and very broad comment that has absolutely zero basis.", "Or that's why the guy he had previously been sharing a tent with decided to sleep with the other girl instead...", "Obviously OP wouldn't know!!!! Shocker.", "That's why I said most. That means many not all", "Or the person in question has already turned them down. I've had to say that as a polite way to explain why \"no mom I'm not asking <guy friend I had a crush on> to prom\"", "Okay well just because you were a f boy when you were doesn\u2019t mean all guys are.", "Poor, put upon men! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "\ud83d\ude44", "Have you ever considered that it's reactions like yours that actually cause the issues men face?
