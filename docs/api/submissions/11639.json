I was OK with this and he seemed fine too. But when the time actually came and we went to bed he seemed really uncomfortable and tense.

But he kept fidgeting and I was so tired from the day so it was just annoying. So I decided to grab some blankets and told him that I\u2019ll sleep outside. He said that it\u2019s not a good idea and I told him I\u2019d rather get a good nights sleep. \n\nWe started arguing-whispering in the dark and I told him to sleep outside so it works out for everyone. He was unhappy with this and told me I can\u2019t just kick him out. I told him then I\u2019d do it but he didn\u2019t want this either?? At this point I was truly fed up and I asked him to offer solutions. He ultimately went to sleep outside. In the morning I woke up and he was in the tent with me but grumbled that he just came in the morning. \n\nI felt energised and well rested but he looked super disheveled and you could tell he didn\u2019t sleep at all. Now he just keeps giving me weird glances and seems annoyed. \n\nWhen our friends found out what happened they called me \u201cmean\u201d for making him sleep outside and that we could\u2019ve solved the issue differently. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1678115293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k1bry/aita_for_telling_my_guy_friend_to_sleep_outside/", "score": 1807, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jumping to the conclusion of simply kicking him out of the tent was a bit much, and then having the audacity to mention you were well rested in the morning and he wasn\u2019t is what makes you the AH. If the tables were turned and he kicked you out you would most definitely be singing a different tune and have a different opinion about how things went down and would be calling them all AHs. The saying \u201cdo onto others as you would have them do to you\u201d is coming to mind. I\u2019m not religious by any means but I do believe in this saying as part of being a decent human being.", "You nta but your friend sure is. Dog move putting you in a situation like that", "The only AH here are the friends who decided to shack up. You don\u2019t do things that force a female friend to share a tent with a man.", "NTA but holy fuck does this guy have a crush on you. Ha ha ha ha all your comments are cracking me up. You are so oblivious to it. The real AH here are the other two.", "You\u2019re 23 year old!   Why cant you communicate?  Your life is about to get more difficult for the rest of your life!  Take time to start working through conflict resolution. I just don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t speak up instead of making excuses and making life difficult\u2026.its Camping \u2026.Grow the fuck up..YTA", "NTA & They tried to set it up so he could \"make a move\" and because you're not interested and he never communicated like an adult it just got worse. You made the right decision and honestly I would insist on getting your own space moving forward - especially since your friends don't understand consent or communication.\n\nBasically your friends expected you to sleep with him and I think that's a bigger conversation you need to have with them, because them shaming you for not consenting to going without sleep (or sleeping with him so he'd stop fussing) is vile.\n\n-and- I say this because of all the comments you've made about the situation and Theo's behaviors.", "Nta.  You offered to remove yourself and sleep outside.  He said no.  So he should have slept outside then.  Bc u 2 couldn't share the space", "That sounds like a set up by your friends trying to hook you guys up.", "NTA And those two unnamed friends were trying to get something going with you and Theo. Why? Probably because Theo has talked about his feelings for you with them and they went with some romcom nonsense.\n\nAnd before people claim I'm jumping to conclusions, read OP's replies to questions. Theo has made frequent jokes about them being married.", "Yes", "ESH", "NTA. Sounds like he wanted to put his wiener inside you and couldn\u2019t figure out how to make that happen.", "NTA.  You offered to go outside first.  He said no.  Then you counteroffered him to go outside.  He said no.  You asked for solutions.  His solution was apparently to grumble and be upset and go outside.  Then tell the friends lies about what actually happened.  You were not mean.  If he couldn't stop talking, moving, what were you supposed to do?  You problem solved, he was just problem.", "NTA please get better friends this whole situation gives me a bad feeling", "The others are the Assholes for changing the sleeping arrangements without getting everyone's buy in.", "YTA You have the patience level of a spoiled toddler and wonder why he\u2019s annoyed.

That or he\u2019s been teased enough times about it that he\u2019s considering the possibility.\nYour friends are TAs though because they put you in an uncomfortable situation and then gaslit you about it.", "Doesn't sound like he did anything wrong besides not being able to sleep definitely TA", "Esh. Sounds like your 2 friends wanted to fuck and left you with this guy Theo. Theo was probably open to hook up but seems like you weren\u2019t. Which made an awkward situation.\n\nMaybe he was tossing and turning hoping to create a situation that would offer solutions to help him sleep.. Idk.  \n\nEither way when sleeping in a tent with someone-else you have to meet in the middle.", "NTA sounds like he wanted to get in your pants", "Nope NTA. This happened to me when I was 21 and I wish I was like you and kicked the guy out. I went camping with a friend, we met up mid-trip with 2 of their friends and my friend left me to hook up with one of them. I had no where to sleep except with this random older man and even though I repeatedly told him I had a boyfriend back home he kept trying to touch me and I woke up to him groping me.\n\nYour friend sucks. It was a fucked up position to put you in.", "But you are a soft a****** because you could have worked something out", "Solved it differently - how? By having sex with him? NOPE. He was the asshold for not respecting your wishes and acting like a spoiled 4 year old.", "NAH, I\u2019ve read through the responses. Either hook up with this guy or try dating him. Or leave the friend group. It will only get more complicated as time goes on. Either way the dynamic is forever changed. And probably over the next few years it will fizzle out.", "INFO: hiking or standing camp? \nMy inclination is to say your female friend is an AH for changing sleeping arrangements- if she wanted to share with your other friend, she should have had a contingency for you and planned for it BEFORE leaving home. If you hiked in, she shouldn\u2019t have changed, simply for your comfort and safety. If you drove in, it\u2019s a good idea to have a spare tent in the car to make sure you\u2019re not getting caught out with a busted tent or someone getting sick and needing to be isolated. \n\nBut you offered to sleep out, Theo made an issue about it thanks to his own issues. \n\nNTA, but you need camping friends who plan better and don\u2019t put their own wants ahead of the success of the group. If you decide to go with them again, take your own tent or pack an emergency hammock so you\u2019re not forced into a sleeping arrangement you didn\u2019t agree to again.", "NTA. But you are completely oblivious to the rest of the groups attempt to help Theo hook up with you. \n\nAnd you can explain to the group that you offered to sleep outside but Theo said no. So he did this to himself", "NTA Hey honey, like other ppl in the comments have said he is into you. Reading your comments it sounds like you have a hard time reading tone, emotional indicators, and other non-explicitly stated intentions.  If everyone is telling you the same thing, it\u2019s most likely what is happening. I know it\u2019s hard to trust yourself when you know you don\u2019t know but trust all of us. \n\nHE. IS. IN. TO. YOU. \n\nYour friends set this up. They cornered you with a potentially sexual encounter against your own desires or expression of want. I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. I think it\u2019s time for new friends.", "We all know theo wanted some. And we all know op was genuinely there for a good time. Everyone else wanted theo to have some. Op is just oblivious to the situation", "IMHO-This plus OP\u2019s mention that he will often make \u201cif we were married\u2026\u201d comments, means she got set up. Her friends are shit, and Theo is a creep for 1. going with this plan and 2. keeping her in the dark. And also he\u2019s controlling, by refusing to let her go out, refusing to go out himself, refusing to offer other solutions, refuse to let her go AGAIN! before going himself, and then act like she\u2019s the AH and turning the other friends against her. It\u2019s a triangle of fucked up that I think OP should run far, far away from.", "This is a ridiculous conclusion and should definitely go outside more...", "Agreed but also want to note that Theo also could have spoken up for himself and talked to his friend who kicked him out the tent too. Its unfair to put all the responsibility on the OP to cater to Theo's feelings. at the expense of her own. She was fine sleeping in the tent with him if he would stop rustling around and keeping her up.  NTA", "Haha, every older person who has camped/ road-tripped with others has this story somewhere in their history. The one that doesn\u2019t keep you from camping/ road-tripping with other people but makes you pretty aware of points where there is potential for shenanigans derailing everyone\u2019s fun. I think you handled this as well as you could have, giving everyone the benefit of the doubt.", "ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT", "Girl, whatever it is, they were plotting against you. Maybe he's got a thing for you and the other two knew and wanted to give him the chance to make a move. Not necessarily for sex, but for something for sure.\nHow old are y'all? When I was like 15 and sharing a tent with a friend I had a thing for, I've been this fidgety as well - innocent me had high hopes for some cuddles. Could be something innocently immature thing like that.\n\nAnyhow, they were plotting something and the other two feel bad for Theo; that's why they're mad at you now, calling you mean. They hope you'll apologize and thereby giving him another chance. They're projecting. \nTheo himself is just mad that he made you mad instead of fond of him. But since he didn't get turned down officially he cannot accept it either. He's stuck due to his own actions and therefore he's grumpy.\n\nIf I were you, I'd ask the other girl and press her for answers.", "Mmmmmmmm babe. Yeah they were.", "Part of being 23 is realizing you\u2019re growing apart from  your so-called \u201cfriends\u201d. And realizing most people are simply selfish.", "I wasn't putting it all on op.

Op isn't at fault and like you said unfortunately theo was the one with the issue.", "Also, always have your own tent.", "I\u2019m an anxious sleeper. I toss and turn all night asleep or awake. Idk why but I just am. Being in a tent would properly make it 10x worse", "I have a very hard time sleeping around other people. Even my partner after 5+ years. I know I need to be respectful of their sleep, so my insomniac ass gets extra fidgety cause I get anxious about bothering others. Not saying this is the case for this dude, but getting fidgety around others is a thing.", "There's a million fucking possible reasons. Why are flaired users on here such psychos?", "Maybe he's never slept with the girl before. You know like going to sleep instead of being in the bed and having sex", "For me personally it would be sleeping in a tent. My cousins family lived in a ranch and we would sleep in their \"warehouse\" home type of place. (Not a house but more like a big shack that acted as a shelter/home.) Was never comfortable sleeping over as a kid cause of all the sounds of small critters and they had rats and such. Slept on a cot or a mattress on the floor. They had a Porta potty but it was always super dark out with no lights or moonlight either. Always held it when needing to pee. My guess the guy just couldn't fall asleep in a tent or whatever.", "This. I have a huge tent & wouldn\u2019t share with anyone because I need my space", "Hammock life", "Not saying he has it but as a comparison I have ADHD and falling asleep is incredibly difficult for me.\n\nFidgety, tossing and turning, and if I don't have something to distract my brain I'll just think of a million things and be unable to fall asleep.\n\nI wouldn't shoot right to he wanted to have sex. Could be any numerous things including your examples or otherwise.", "I would have asked the op to sleep outside if she is uncomfortable. Don't try to be a hero. You need to look out for yourself.

What would others think if he left the girl to sleep outside and he enjoyed getting a good night sleep. Also if anything happens to the girl outside, he would have been velified.", "You definitely have a better read on the situation than OP who was actually there and actually knows the guy.", ">Like a lot, but in a jokey way. For example he often points out how different we are (I\u2019m more of a homebody bookworm, he\u2019s the complete opposite) and that it would cause lots of problems in marriage (yes, marriage). I just laugh it off and never took it seriously.\n\nThat was OP in response to a question about how frequently he jokes about them being together.\n\nWho frequently jokes about being a relationship with someone? A person fishing for a greenlight to hit on a friend.", "You do know that OP has posted several times that indicate that Theo has feelings for her, right?\n\nThe guy **frequently** jokes about what it would be like if they were married and how weird it would be.", "Oh Theo is **definitely** into OP. He *frequently* brings up how \u201cweird\u201d it would be if they \u201cwere married\u201d lmao. \n\nHe was fidgety because he was tryna fuck and OP was tryna sleep.", "I didn't catch OP saying that, I saw random speculations from commenters.

They read stuff between the lines to fit whatever they want to believe about others. \n\nI remember in college an English professor started a segment on one of the famous dead authors you read in College (I think it was Poe but it's been years) and he said the author stated his work had no deeper meaning and that there were no hidden themes or anything in their work, it was just for entertainment. Then spent the next 4 weeks talking about the deeper meaning and hidden themes that were in that work. I'm pretty sure that professor was a peak Reddit.", "OP has said that he jokes about the two of them being married a lot.

He is absolutely testing the waters in a very awkward, roundabout way. OP, Theo is definitely into you.", "That's a critical piece of information there. OP got set up by her friends and didn't know.", "UNLESS\u2026", "He was 1000% tryna \u201ccrack-on\u201d in the tent. One. Thousand.

People who aren't interested in each other don't talk about what life married to each would be like.", "Ok, I honestly can\u2019t imagine a situation someone would make jokes like this and NOT have at least some feelings for you. That\u2019s just about the most overt flirting imaginable \n\nIt would also explain his behavior.
