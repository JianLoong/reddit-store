My mom remarried last year after being with my stepdad since I was 5. My dad, however, has been remarried three times since and was in 6 other live in relationships. The last marriage stuck better than the others and they celebrated their 4th wedding anniversary in June. I was 13 when dad married his wife. He only introduced me to her after they got engaged. I think she was the other woman in his third marriage. But I can't be sure. I do know he cheated on his ex-wife though and they were only married for like 18 months before she was gone.\n\nI still remember him introducing her and her boys who were 2 and 4 at the time. I know people will suggest the youngest at least must be dad's but he's biracial and both my dad and his wife are white so I really don't think so. They were saying how we were going to be a family and she told me her boys would really love a big brother. I was not super enthusiastic and really didn't like that I was being called a big brother to two random kids. They married five months later and a week later my dad forced me to babysit the boys so they could go on a date. The next week I was at his house he forced me to babysit so she could go shopping for a few hours. His wife told me it was a great chance for us to bond and I don't think she or my dad were happy when I basically just sat there during the day or left them in bed at night when babysitting. I didn't want to do it and I told my dad and he said it was tough luck. After the instability my dad provided after his divorce from my mom and the fact I felt like he basically gave me the biggest f u since he didn't even give me the chance to meet them before he got serious. I asked my mom if she would fight for custody of me and she did and won. We had a lot of the instability and my age to thank for that.\n\nMy dad really tried to keep me involved even though I was living with mom and he tried to get me to babysit a few more times before finally giving up that angle. But now it's been years and he's upset that I don't act like I'm part of his family and have not made an effort to know his stepkids. He called my mom about graduation after Christmas and he got really annoyed when he heard there were going to be limited spaces and I had already claimed my share. I saw him new years eve at my grandparents party and he approached me and told me how disappointed he was that things had failed. He tried to drag my grandparents into the conversation too. Then he said \"it's like our family failed because I made you babysit once or twice\" and I told him it was a big reason since I hardly knew his wife or her kids and he made it clear my opinion and comfort meant nothing to him. His stepkids were there so he got pissed at me for confirming it. I told him he shouldn't have said it so and he should have left me alone.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704648756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190xdi9/aita_for_saying_my_dad_forcing_me_to_babysit_for/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad seems to be using you as a tool, and not considering your opinion.   It's a bit audacious to bring up the term family when he seems to have churned through women and may have a skewed idea of what a family is. \n\nOn the bright side, you appear to have recognized your father's failings and you don't view them positively, so you are likely to not repeat his mistakes.\n\n> \"it's like our family failed because I made you babysit once or twice\"\n\nThis blows my mind.   He is clearly blind to what he has done.", "NTA - sounds like you've had a pretty confusing and tumultuous life, no thanks to your dad.  One especially crappy part about it is, he doesn't understand it and likely won't ever understand it.\n\nI can dredge up a \\_smidge\\_  of sympathy for your dad in that , yeah I can understand his disappointment at you not being in his life.  The thought of one's own kid making an active decision to never want to be around them is an exceedingly depressing one.   That said, his statements to you make it very obvious that he is so self absorbed that he cannot connect the dots between a) your rational decision to just be free of  him, with b) his treatment of you and trying to force a whole new family on you with no regard to your feelings on the matter.   I don't have a lot of hope that he will ever come to enlightenment.\n\nThis is not even mentioning the 3 marriages and 6 live in situations .  That he has no grasp of what a chaotic and unhealthy environment that is for his own son is ... sad.    Sorry you are having to navigate this.  I'm glad you've got your mom in all of this.", "NTA. It really doesn\u2019t looks like dad wanted a blended family, otherwise everyone would have been together instead of you having to babysit 2 kids you barely know. Dad is just pouting he didn\u2019t got his cake to eat too.", "Lol your dad has such nerve! He blames you, the child in this situation?!?! He can't keep a relationship (multiple wives, affairs, etc.) but it's your fault. Huh? Instead of spending time & bonding with you, he forced you to babysit kids you didn't want to or even know. He needs to learn the meaning of family & learn how to treat others with love & respect. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, nor did you say anything that wasn't the truth.", "When you say \u201ctried to keep me involved\u201d, I just hear (and I bet you do too) \u201ctried to keep his free babysitter\u201d.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhy bond with these kids when--at the time--the odds were good they would be gone in 6 months?", "NTA", "NTA. It sounds like when he had visitation he used you as a built-in babysitter so he and his wife could go out. That's not the purpose of visitation. I don't blame you for feeling distant.", "NTA \n\nYour dad was definitely using you as a free babysitter so he could go off and be with his wife.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, after his other two disastrous remarriages, did he really think you were open to getting to know them? Personally, I would have kept them at arms length since I would be under the impression that they were gonna be temporary. Your father should have done a better job with the introductions since forcing a bond/relationship never goes well. \n\nFor your reaction to him at the party, what did he think you were gonna say? \u201cYes, I truly am a disappointment, can you ever forgive me?\u201d He tried to push a bond/wanted a free babysitter. Not your problem that he is delusional and lacks self awareness.", "NTA", "NTA. Your dad's approach was pretty unfair, and it's okay for you to express how you felt. You didn't ruin anything; he should've respected your boundaries and made sure you were comfortable with the situation. It's not on you that things didn't work out as your dad hoped and he did put you on a tough spot.", "NTA.\n\nBabysitting isn't a bonding activity unless the older person initiates it. \n\nExpecting childcare to be an... innate skill, no matter the age, is just stupid. You have to teach people what to do if you expect them to do something \"correctly\", bare minimum running through what you think that entails. I *hate this, so much* when parents do this, and expect that once a kid reaches a certain age they'll \"\"just know\"\" how to do things. Not if you never took the time to teach them, dumbass, you were literally there for their whole life.\n\nEspecially toddlers! Young children require specialized care! jfc \n\nHe would have been better off taking you *all* to something exciting to do together, do board games as a family, etc. Let you get to know each other as kids first, not just as a responsibility/authority figure.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He literally went straight to one of the points of content, but chose to treat it as nonsense", "Would have to have been there.  He could genuinely have felt it was win/win.  He and the wife get date night once weekly or bi-weekly (Dad says \"only two times\", but we all know what would have happened had OP stayed with them longer than that), and the kids get to know eachother.  Part of the problem is that Dad put a rush on this and implied that he didn't really care what OP felt about the situation.\n\n\"I know people will suggest the youngest at least must be dad's but he's biracial and both my dad and his wife are white so I really don't think so.\"\n\nThe assumption may very well be correct, but might not be.  Sometimes genetic traits skip a generation or two, so it may have been a Grandparent or even a Great-Grandparent who cheated.  Be very, very careful about flinging any accusations without backup from a DNA test and match."]}
