My mom remarried last year after being with my stepdad since I was 5. My dad, however, has been remarried three times since and was in 6 other live in relationships. The last marriage stuck better than the others and they celebrated their 4th wedding anniversary in June. I was 13 when dad married his wife. He only introduced me to her after they got engaged. I think she was the other woman in his third marriage. But I can't be sure. I do know he cheated on his ex-wife though and they were only married for like 18 months before she was gone.\n\nI still remember him introducing her and her boys who were 2 and 4 at the time. I know people will suggest the youngest at least must be dad's but he's biracial and both my dad and his wife are white so I really don't think so. They were saying how we were going to be a family and she told me her boys would really love a big brother. I was not super enthusiastic and really didn't like that I was being called a big brother to two random kids. They married five months later and a week later my dad forced me to babysit the boys so they could go on a date. The next week I was at his house he forced me to babysit so she could go shopping for a few hours. His wife told me it was a great chance for us to bond and I don't think she or my dad were happy when I basically just sat there during the day or left them in bed at night when babysitting. I didn't want to do it and I told my dad and he said it was tough luck. After the instability my dad provided after his divorce from my mom and the fact I felt like he basically gave me the biggest f u since he didn't even give me the chance to meet them before he got serious. I asked my mom if she would fight for custody of me and she did and won. We had a lot of the instability and my age to thank for that.\n\nMy dad really tried to keep me involved even though I was living with mom and he tried to get me to babysit a few more times before finally giving up that angle. But now it's been years and he's upset that I don't act like I'm part of his family and have not made an effort to know his stepkids. He called my mom about graduation after Christmas and he got really annoyed when he heard there were going to be limited spaces and I had already claimed my share. I saw him new years eve at my grandparents party and he approached me and told me how disappointed he was that things had failed. He tried to drag my grandparents into the conversation too. Then he said \"it's like our family failed because I made you babysit once or twice\" and I told him it was a big reason since I hardly knew his wife or her kids and he made it clear my opinion and comfort meant nothing to him. His stepkids were there so he got pissed at me for confirming it. I told him he shouldn't have said it so and he should have left me alone.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704648756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190xdi9/aita_for_saying_my_dad_forcing_me_to_babysit_for/", "score": 1375, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One especially crappy part about it is, he doesn't understand it and likely won't ever understand it.\n\nI can dredge up a \\_smidge\\_  of sympathy for your dad in that , yeah I can understand his disappointment at you not being in his life.  The thought of one's own kid making an active decision to never want to be around them is an exceedingly depressing one.   That said, his statements to you make it very obvious that he is so self absorbed that he cannot connect the dots between a) your rational decision to just be free of  him, with b) his treatment of you and trying to force a whole new family on you with no regard to your feelings on the matter.   I don't have a lot of hope that he will ever come to enlightenment.\n\nThis is not even mentioning the 3 marriages and 6 live in situations .
