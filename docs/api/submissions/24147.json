I\u2019m hosting a bridal shower in a week for FDIL 24. My mom 82 is in a same sex relationship also 82. I\u2019ve know she\u2019s gay for all my life and am fine with it; my husband and all our kids know and everyone is very accepting. However her partner is a raging alcoholic. She has never in 40 years shown me any kindness or respect (once even cussing me out in my own home). I never lived with them; my dad raised me and mom had visitation. Anyway this woman is expecting to come to the shower. She was not invited nor does she even like my FDIL (who is wonderful btw). I cannot trust her to carry on a civil convo, behave etc. I made it clear this weekend to mom that she is not welcome at the shower and now there is all kinds of drama. Weeping wailing cussing etc. I\u2019ve told mom I\u2019m not talking about it any more, partner is not to come, and I hope to see her there.

Told my mom not to bring her partner to a bridal shower and 2. This might make me an asshole because the person in question is upset that I said she can\u2019t come AND my mom is upset that I said that. The partner is a entrenched alcoholic.
