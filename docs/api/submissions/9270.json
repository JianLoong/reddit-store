But a clean house is also a priority, just how it gets clean isn't.\n\nPersonally I don't see the value in it, even having house keepers growing up. So I clean my own house, but I spend my disposable income how I see fit, to make my life enriched. You should be able to do the same!\n\nETA if your partner has standards, he should clean the house the way he wants it. I have asked my husband to clean certain ways but ultimately I'm just grateful he helped out around the house! When I want something cleaned a certain way I just do it myself. It never makes him feel good when I pick apart something he honestly tried his best at, he just doesn't have the same standards as me! And that's ok! He does many things wonderfully well and is always dedicated to us.", "Tbf, technically you are spoiled and entitled and that is your parent's fault too - however, it is your money and if you're willing to pay for it with your own money I don't see the issue. \n\nNTA.

And who knows, maybe your husband sees the advantages and chips in in the longrun.", "INFO if you lived alone would you still want to hire someone or just do it yourself?", "NAH\n\nYou don't sound culturally naive, so when entering this marriage you knew there were certain expectations. \n\nI understand wanting to pay for someone if you can afford it, however it is so much more costly and different in general than in India.\n\nThe main issue is, it doesn't seem you don't have time to do these jobs, you just do them poorly. If you're going to do it, do it right, would you take this approach with your studies?\n\nIt would take far less time to do your tasks right then take on tutoring responsibilities.", "I say NTA. \n\nYou have been, by your above context, giving the chores and household duties a shot, as someone who hasn't really ever had to do them. It's not like you tried to opt out of chores from the beginning. You have tried. But he seems dissatisfied and I can imagine how frustrating and potentially hurtful it might feel when he finds faults more often than not.   \n\n\nMaybe you just need more practice. Nobody is perfect at everything; especially stuff they've never really done before. But, you have offered an alternative to help him have the results he's looking for, and you've offered to work extra hard to supplement that option. It's not like you are telling him to do all the work or to pay for a cleaner. \n\nAn entitled person would refuse to do the cleaning, expect him to do it all, or expect him to supplement a maid. You have done none of those things.", "NTA. These chores are harder than people often give them credit for, but they're easy when you know how.

It is unfortunate that your parents didn't teach you the basics of domestic responsibility, but your solution is a reasonable one. \n\nIt's not lazy to want to put in extra effort in an area you enjoy and thrive to be able to pay someone to do things you don't enjoy.

If you don't make much as a resident, is the main cost falling on your husband? If you increase your income to pay for your chores to be done but don't contribute more to household expenses, is it fair on him? \n\nPut it this way. If, hypothetically, Spouse 1 earned three times as much as Spouse 2 and paid 75% of household expenses to Spouse 2's 25%, is it fair for Spouse 2 to start working extra hours and spending all the extra earnings on something that only Spouse 2 wants? \n\nThere are a lot of different sides to this problem. As a resident, you don't make a lot now but can probably expect to earn a lot more in future, so over the course of the marriage the financial side should balance out. As an adult, you should be capable of doing household chores even if you choose to pay somebody to do them. As a partner, you should be able to hold up your end of the household burden, and it would be infuriating to your husband that you don't even seem to be trying. Even if you pay for housework to get done, you would probably still be leaving a lot of the mental load to your husband, because you've never done it and don't care to. As a resident, your spare time is probably limited and housework might not be a good use of it, and you probably don't have a lot of mental load to spare. But fundamentally, as a partner, you should be able to see why it bothers your partner why you don't want to do your share at home, and work out a compromise that addresses his concerns properly. I see why you think hiring help is the solution, but it's only the solution when you don't realise what that *doesn't* solve - the responsibility, the mental load, the one who always has to think of everything. That's why I think you're being an asshole even though you're trying to compromise.", "NTA, I wouldn't say your spoiled okay you are a bit but I kind of don't like how your husband has said it to you and made it seem like you have to be a robot when doing the housework. Doing a residency that is over 14 hours is not easy and especially if you're new to the profession not sure if you are but still. And you are going to pay for the made out of your own pocket so he shouldn't be fussing. And someone said that their brother always wanted to wear nice looking clothes so their mother was sick of ironing and said that it's either you suck it up or do it yourself I agree with that lesson because if you want something right do it yourself.

We had a similar disagreement because I associate 'help' with immense privilege, and for her in India it was a lot more normalized, as you say. We compromised with a fortnightly cleaner - occasional help, but not constantly. We both split the cost. I understand his reticence but it's your prerogative if you'd rather do other labour - because domestic work is labour - with your time.\n\nRegardless, him calling you entitled and spoiled is..... very rude? Paying for a service with your own money is the opposite of entitled. And it's hard not to read some sexism into his insistence that you have domestic responsibilities.

I'm going with your husband on this one, you are a spoiled entitled brat.", ">its genuinely not about being rich there most middle class families have hired help\n\nIt absolutely is about being rich.  Whether it's normal or not is irrelevant. Thinking otherwise suggests you're extremely out of touch with reality. \n\nOverall, sounds like YTA.  Nothing wrong with hiring a cleaning service but there's a point where it becomes ridiculous.  The fact that you don't even know how to do chores?  You're miles across that line.

They still need to be done, and these are things you should learn how to do.

I do cook, however, but luckily I have no one that complains when something is overcooked or undercooked and I do order or go out to eat often as well. \n\nIf you consider it worth your money to get a maid, then do it. It is your money. Ignore all those people who lack reading comprehension.", "As someone who has been in the situation you described, my SO helped me realise that I was making sad excuses.", "It will take less time to just vacuum the floor or scrub a toilet than it would to do the extra work to earn money to pay someone else to do that.", "[deleted]", "Okay sorry, I didn\u2019t read your post correctly and I apologise for that.\n\nI stick with my greater point though in so far that I think it\u2019s weird to hire help on a part time job. Yet that is my personal opinion and had I completely read your post, I would have replied (and judged) differently.", "I don't know about the UK, but that's not really true in the US.  I'm a teacher and I have someone clean once a month.  Lots of people get help cleaning.", "Noted thank you for the advice . I think it's the cultural difference . He grew up here while I grew up in India and he thinks I'm wasting money while I think time is also money and the free time we get to spend together because of this being out of the way is worth it .", "Fair . I honestly am just tired of being criticised all the time and I'd take spoilt brat over useless wife any day \ud83d\ude05", "And? She enjoys the former and not the latter. What's the problem with deciding to do what she enjoys to then support the local economy by hiring someone to do what she doesn't?", "But she clearly stated that she would take up tutoring as a second job to pay exclusively for a maid.", "To narrow it down even more, she says her income \u201cisn\u2019t much\u201d", "Talking about England where op says they live", "Yeah I've met people like that but it's not throwing money out the window if it improves your quality of life. They being said in my country it's also a scheme to get people back to work and is thus tax deductible for me, which somehow makes it easier to explain (as if you need to justify your well being or creating employment \ud83d\ude44)\n\nMaybe tell him you'll learn to do them for education sake but you value your free time too much to slave doing them? Suggest a trial run with a maid of a few weeks so he can decide later (paid by you)?\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 was similar and now, when he sees our cleaning dude, he goes 'thank God you're here!'", "My brother always wanted to wear nice shirts and suits - even as a teenager, and he was similar to what you said about your husband. My mom got so sick of ironing that she said if he is not happy with how she does it, either suck it up or do it himself.", "Honestly this sounds like more of the issue rather than the chores themselves or hiring someone to help out. His expectations and criticisms do not sound ok. Does he see you as a partner, or more like a traditional wife that he is the boss of? Why is ironing (which seriously who even still does that) your chore if he has higher expectations and does a better job? Sounds like a great job for him."]}
