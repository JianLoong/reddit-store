But a clean house is also a priority, just how it gets clean isn't.\n\nPersonally I don't see the value in it, even having house keepers growing up. So I clean my own house, but I spend my disposable income how I see fit, to make my life enriched. You should be able to do the same!\n\nETA if your partner has standards, he should clean the house the way he wants it. I have asked my husband to clean certain ways but ultimately I'm just grateful he helped out around the house! When I want something cleaned a certain way I just do it myself.

Nobody is perfect at everything; especially stuff they've never really done before. But, you have offered an alternative to help him have the results he's looking for, and you've offered to work extra hard to supplement that option.

If you don't make much as a resident, is the main cost falling on your husband? If you increase your income to pay for your chores to be done but don't contribute more to household expenses, is it fair on him? \n\nPut it this way. If, hypothetically, Spouse 1 earned three times as much as Spouse 2 and paid 75% of household expenses to Spouse 2's 25%, is it fair for Spouse 2 to start working extra hours and spending all the extra earnings on something that only Spouse 2 wants? \n\nThere are a lot of different sides to this problem. As a resident, you don't make a lot now but can probably expect to earn a lot more in future, so over the course of the marriage the financial side should balance out. As an adult, you should be capable of doing household chores even if you choose to pay somebody to do them. As a partner, you should be able to hold up your end of the household burden, and it would be infuriating to your husband that you don't even seem to be trying. Even if you pay for housework to get done, you would probably still be leaving a lot of the mental load to your husband, because you've never done it and don't care to. As a resident, your spare time is probably limited and housework might not be a good use of it, and you probably don't have a lot of mental load to spare. But fundamentally, as a partner, you should be able to see why it bothers your partner why you don't want to do your share at home, and work out a compromise that addresses his concerns properly. I see why you think hiring help is the solution, but it's only the solution when you don't realise what that *doesn't* solve - the responsibility, the mental load, the one who always has to think of everything. That's why I think you're being an asshole even though you're trying to compromise.", "NTA, I wouldn't say your spoiled okay you are a bit but I kind of don't like how your husband has said it to you and made it seem like you have to be a robot when doing the housework. Doing a residency that is over 14 hours is not easy and especially if you're new to the profession not sure if you are but still. And you are going to pay for the made out of your own pocket so he shouldn't be fussing. And someone said that their brother always wanted to wear nice looking clothes so their mother was sick of ironing and said that it's either you suck it up or do it yourself I agree with that lesson because if you want something right do it yourself.

It's not that she can't adult properly, she can, she just doesn't need to since she can hire a helper, it's not like she's just leaving the chores all together, or making him do it alone.

Running a tutoring side hustle around your residency shifts and school hours is going to take way more time than you would free up on chores to spend together.\n\nA weekly ironing drop off/pick up or weekly/biweekly cleaner are not unusual in the UK but they are luxuries. Very few people here have help in the same way as India and it is a \u2018choose between that level of cost and pension contributions/vacation funds\u2019 type situation for most unless the very richest. They are just very different cultures and economies.\n\nMy partner is from a culture where maids are inexpensive for her social class and when she moved to the UK, insisted on matching it as closely as possible. We didn\u2019t live together but it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic when the help could not attend that she realised \u2018her salary wasn\u2019t that low like she thought\u2019 but she was spending a disproportionate amount avoiding honing the skills on building a home with her spouse (we are polyam btw.)\n\nTbf she was massively over loaded settling into British life, speaking English full time, immersing into fluency across reading, writing and speaking at all times, homesickness, the visa situation not allowing her spouse and her to live together first, new job, training etc. And it was hard to phrase that so instead she went a bit \u2018princess\u2019 about cleaning etc and insisted she would side hustle. She was so miserable stuck between the two.\n\nRealising she hated cooking, communicating with her spouse (and me) and adapting so the side hustle wasn\u2019t needed and swapping chores to better fit, freed up cash to do stuff that helped her feel more at home and less culture shocked and ultimately helped more. Including vacuuming!\n\nAnd they needed to be putting aside money. Cost of living now, pension later, money for kids, rainy day fund. You really don\u2019t earn that much as a newly qualified doctor here and unless your husband is earning a lot, it\u2019s a worrying financial take. I mean most of the NHS is out on strikes over wages and overwork and you want to spend money you don\u2019t have and take a second job that may impact your ability in the wards and also go against GMC rules re second jobs until you have accrued enough hours to be deemed capable.\n\nThis is absolute red flag territory on your problem solving, time management, future planning and team work skills in the marriage and your financial attitudes.

After a 13+ hour day in residency, where you are constantly criticized, she doesn't need to come home to be criticized even more. I don't think husband appreciates or supports her doing her residency. He wants perfection for himself. So, she's giving it to him and paying for it herself.

The reality is that you aren't interested in prioritizing your time the way your husband feels you should.

We both work full-time and have two kids. I do all of the cooking and much of the cleaning, so I feel this situation down to the ground. My husband has also pushed back on me for several years about hiring a cleaning service, but we're getting to the point where we will likely need to (my mom has advanced cancer and is likely approaching her final months and, though she's mobile and pretty independent, I still do a lot of her caregiving and this isn't going to get better). \n\nAnyway, all this to say that in my mind, you're NTA. And I would encourage you to remind your husband that he wins in this situation, too - hopefully this will result in additional free time for him, and if he has such very high standards, having someone who meets those standards as a job will take the emotion out of it and likely result in those standards being met more consistently.", "Nta.

You are not responsible for ironing his clothes, especially not to his exacting standards. If he dislikes your cooking, he should be the cook in the household.

He needs to make a decision, either stop complaining about the way you do things or be OK with hiring out.  Try to get your husband on board with hiring out for a few things at first (maybe a deep clean once a month or an ironing service) to free up both of your time. See how you like it and how it is helping.  You can always add/remove change items as you both realize how much help you really need. \n\nAlso, look at combining your income. You guys are married.
