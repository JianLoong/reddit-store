So I clean my own house, but I spend my disposable income how I see fit, to make my life enriched.

I have asked my husband to clean certain ways but ultimately I'm just grateful he helped out around the house! When I want something cleaned a certain way I just do it myself.

Nobody is perfect at everything; especially stuff they've never really done before. But, you have offered an alternative to help him have the results he's looking for, and you've offered to work extra hard to supplement that option.

If you don't make much as a resident, is the main cost falling on your husband? If you increase your income to pay for your chores to be done but don't contribute more to household expenses, is it fair on him? \n\nPut it this way. If, hypothetically, Spouse 1 earned three times as much as Spouse 2 and paid 75% of household expenses to Spouse 2's 25%, is it fair for Spouse 2 to start working extra hours and spending all the extra earnings on something that only Spouse 2 wants? \n\nThere are a lot of different sides to this problem. As a resident, you don't make a lot now but can probably expect to earn a lot more in future, so over the course of the marriage the financial side should balance out. As an adult, you should be capable of doing household chores even if you choose to pay somebody to do them. As a partner, you should be able to hold up your end of the household burden, and it would be infuriating to your husband that you don't even seem to be trying. Even if you pay for housework to get done, you would probably still be leaving a lot of the mental load to your husband, because you've never done it and don't care to. As a resident, your spare time is probably limited and housework might not be a good use of it, and you probably don't have a lot of mental load to spare. But fundamentally, as a partner, you should be able to see why it bothers your partner why you don't want to do your share at home, and work out a compromise that addresses his concerns properly. I see why you think hiring help is the solution, but it's only the solution when you don't realise what that *doesn't* solve - the responsibility, the mental load, the one who always has to think of everything. That's why I think you're being an asshole even though you're trying to compromise.", "NTA, I wouldn't say your spoiled okay you are a bit but I kind of don't like how your husband has said it to you and made it seem like you have to be a robot when doing the housework.

And you are going to pay for the made out of your own pocket so he shouldn't be fussing. And someone said that their brother always wanted to wear nice looking clothes so their mother was sick of ironing and said that it's either you suck it up or do it yourself I agree with that lesson because if you want something right do it yourself.

Most of us can't predict when something will go horribly wrong that could leave us in financial straits. \n\nLike arguably I don't need to know how to change a tyre or wash clothes in the bathtub, but I still think it's useful to know how.", "To be fair, vacuuming is a hitting a button and walking around\u2026.", "Yes I have. And she managed to be a fully functional person living with her husband and taking care of multiple dogs. She also made time to cleanup her place to have guests stay overnight on her rare days off.\n\nSo again you are not special of the first person to go through residency. Learn how to be a functioning adult.", "I'm not. I'm saying that not doing things up to a basic standard when the gender is reversed is a fast way to get labeled as weaponizing incompetence. Probably should have phrased it better, but I specifically mentioned her trying to say **that is not the case**.", "TIL that not overcooking the pasta, not leaving creases, or emptying the vacuum bag after vacuuming is somehow \"standards\" lol. \n\nBut hey, maybe he meant perfectly al dante pasta, impeccable ironing.... Yeah I still can't come up with an example for the vacuum, given it's a binary y/n.\n\nHe's an AH for the damn unreasonable reaction to hired help but damn, nothing in the examples she gave were abnormal.", "I understand. As an Indian, this doesn't feel very weird to me. Maybe it really does come down to cultural differences. In India, most household chores fall on the head of women and if she has to have a career it is simply not possible to cook and clean, wash everyday. Indian cuisine, especially North Indian is slightly labour intensive so it's simply not possible for one person to do all of it. Getting a hired help is considered liberating the women of the house who otherwise would not get time to do anything else, make a career, have a personal life etc. So to me, this isn't being spoiled but simply how to make time for oneself especially if you are a woman.", "Eh \nMy house is humongous, cleaning it takes way too much time and effort. It's not that we're lazy it just a lot of work, so we did for a while have weekly help, so it doesn't all pile up.", "I was also wondering if they could swap chores. Maybe there are things she's better at than getting every last crease out of a shirt (not an easy task for someone with little ironing experience).", "For one there isn't a learning curve involved so it's mentally easier on me . Plus I know exactly how much time it's going to take up eg 6 hours a week whereas you can't exactly time chores .", "Why doesn't HE cooks and cleans because clearly he also doesn't like what OP does. She is trying to find a middle ground but he has a problem with that too lmaoo", "Ofcourse but do you perhaps see why improving isn't the most appealing choice for me \ud83d\ude05? I'm just tired of feeling incompetent.", "OP said she can do stuff but they just don't meet her husband's standards. I don't think his reaction is of 'care'", "To be fair, I\u2019m married to an Italian, so overcooking the pasta is not only \u2018standards\u2019 but probably grounds for divorce! :)", "in her edit she says her husband expects her to empty the vacuum bag after each use. who the hell does that, that's so excessive and wasteful", "It surely does, in my home country even high-income families usually don't have maids, only the filthy rich (so to speak). People look at me weirdly when I tell them I order my weekly groceries to save time. I tell them I spoil myself in that regard, so I have more free time.  Again spoiled mustn't be a bad thing (although it often is connotated negatively).\n\nYou also can associate and use the word spoiling in a positive way. And spoiling yourself can be a very good thing.", "OP. I am on a similar boat as you. I completely agree that if you are too overworked and tired then doing chores additional to all the other work can be draining and taxing.", "I think a lot of people\u2019s minds go immediately to full time domestic workers (which, sure, that is expensive) but forget about hiring someone to deep clean the house every so often, using a laundry service, getting meals prepped, or even stuff like carpet cleaning services. So many people are already overworked, and factoring in chores, they just don\u2019t free time to decompress. If someone can afford to hire people so they can take one less stressor off their plate, that\u2019s their prerogative. Not sure what husband is upset about, that money isn\u2019t coming from his pocket\u2026unless he was either expecting OP to be a housewife once they got married, or deliberately trying to make her feel like she can\u2019t do anything right and is just a spoiled lazy brat.", "I totally see it. The thing is, having someone else do something for you doesn\u2019t make you competent. If someone at work made you feel incompetent at your job you\u2019d probably take steps to get better, right? I know it sucks to get that from your spouse, but maybe he\u2019s simply tired of being the only one who can do things. I used to get a lot of flack from my husband because he was taught to cook and I wasn\u2019t, so I made a point of learning new recipes and getting better. It didn\u2019t happen over night, but it did happen.", "Yes, thanks for the explanation. I didn't read that part of your previous comment. My apologies.", "> Does he see you as a partner, or more like a traditional wife that he is the boss of?\n\nI think this. She's training to be a *doctor*, FFS - 12 hour residency shifts suuuuck.\n\nHonestly, while this marriage was arranged with consent, OP I honestly don't think that you two are well-suited. Sounds like your husband wants a traditional wife, but as a physician, you are not going to be able to be one without burning yourself out. \n\nYou two need to be on the same page for this marriage to work."]}
