When I asked my mother why this was the case she said it was because it would cause her a lot of stress and she wasn\u2019t ready to deal with my extended family and family friend seeing me with a man for the first time. Also it might take some of the spotlight off the Bride. My father agrees with these concerns. Keep in mind this is a Christian wedding and will be held in a church. \n\nWhen I asked my sister (who has been kind and accepting in the past) she said she wanted to invite my husband but my parents would not allow it since they are paying for the wedding. \n\nObviously I was upset about this and said that I was not comfortable attending the wedding if my husband was not invited.

They are worried about their friends feeling but care nothing about yours.  Don't go.  Why would you?", "NTA\n\nYou've been out for ten years, and are married. If your extended family don't already know you're gay, they clearly don't actually care that much about you if they have no idea what's going on in your life. \n\nAnd if they do already know you're gay, then they should be the ones to suck it up and not make a fuss over nothing. If they can't bite their tongues and be nice about it, then THEY are the ones who should not be invited out of fear of causing a disruption.", "NTA. Wedding edict is don't invite half of married couple. Just wrong, don't go into that den of toxic people. Because if you go your husband might leave you and I wouldn't blame him. Did any of them come to your wedding?", "My partner\u2019s family did the same thing. My partner chose not to go in support of me. I would have been okay with her going, but it meant a lot. Over the past 20 years her family has \u2018seen the light\u2019 - so there is always hope for the future. \n\nIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t go due the the lack of respect for your partner and your marriage", "NTA. Your sister made her choice and decided to cave into your parents' homophobic demands to have them finance her wedding. Who to invite is her choice; attending or not is yours. \n\nTheir reasons are excuses and this whole scenario is their own making. If friends and family never saw you with a man is because they've systematically excluded your partner from ever being present around friends and family. \n\nI wouldn't go either. Your sister can't expect you to be there celebrating her marriage when she's willing to pretend yours doesn't exist.", "NTA\n\nYou and your sister should stand up about this. I get that in times like weddings it feels hard to stand up to parents but like they are saying this is HER day and if she isn't a bigot and wants you and your husband there then he should be", "NTA. Invitations, of any kind, are not a summons. I find it interesting that they view you not attending as being unsupportive, yet no one is being supportive of you and your relationship. I realize you said your aunt, uncle and younger sister do, but if that was actually true, they would be supportive of inviting him. \n\nSounds like you and your husband deserve to do something nice on that day instead. Maybe you can offer to do something with your sister and her new husband on a different day, if you feel so inclined.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are the primary AHs here, both to you and your partner, and to your sister. This feels like they're using your sister's potential hurt as leverage to get you to conform to their homophobic wishes, and that's pretty gross.\n\nHowever, sad as it may be for your sister if you're not there, she's also making a choice to accept your husband being excluded rather than pushing back or, if needs be, paying for her own (likely far less extravagant) wedding.\n\nIt's unreasonable for her to make that choice, disregarding her love for you, and then expect you to attend out of love for her.", "NTA. If you go, you're enabling your family's bigotry. Stand firm. Let them know that your husband is part of your life and that is non-negotiable.", "NTA. \n\nYou are supposed to be there to support your sister on her \"big day\" but have not and still do not get the same support. \n\nYour sister isn't willing to stand up for you, her and your parents have not done the work to accept you openly with the family and others, and this is the result of that. \n\nYou don't owe your sister an ounce more support than she has given to you, and her being nice about your husband is a pretty low bar. \n\nDon't go where you aren't accepted, have a nice day with your husband in peace.", "NTA. Your husband is part of you and you are part of your sisters family. Who is not accepting this, is not part of the family.\n\nHowever, I would discuss this with your sister and not your mother.", "Your family cares more about appearances than the feelings of a family member. \n\nThat should tell you all you need to know. \n\nDon\u2019t go.

These aren\u2019t Christian people. These are people who care \u201chow it looks \u201c. They don\u2019t want you to skip the wedding because it will cause questions they don\u2019t want to answer. They are delusional to think they can be so dismissive of your marriage and your husband but still expect you to be their puppet and do what they want. Good job sticking up for your husband and yourself!", "NTA but I would recommend talking to your sister. If she wants you and him there. Then your father can't say anything about it being stressful for the bride. It is her wedding and if she really means that she wants you there she will extend the invitation to your spouse. Otherwise I agree on keeping a united front. Allowing them to exclude him in the beginning will only encourage such bigotry for the remainder of your lives.", "NTA\n\nSorry for your sister, she seems like a decent person. Caving to your parents' demands sucks. \n\nYour parents. Omg. They feel that having a gay couple at a wedding would start the spotlight from the bride? Seriously? You're not planning to have sex, right? Just sitting in a pew watching a wedding? WTF planet are they from?\n\nI wonder if having a serious conversation with your sister could preserve your relationship with her, and then just bail on the rest of the family. They sound so horrible!", "NTA your family is your husband. The rest are just homophobic AH\u2019s you grew up with.", "NTA.  If they want you to be there to support your sister, they need to put on their grown-up panties and support you, too.  It's the 21st century, bigots should not be getting more consideration than people just trying to live their lives!  And by the way, your sister is a grown woman making the active choice to cater to bigots, so keep that in mind when people are giving you the \"oh your poor sister\" sob story.", "NTA. They want you there for optics and so they don't have to answer questions about why you aren't there.", "NTA - What's inappropriate is inviting a person but not inviting their spouse. I do feel bad for your sister because I don't think it's really her choice because your parent's are holding the purse strings. But If it's fine that they uncomfortable with him being there, then it should be fine that you are uncomfortable with him NOT being there. \n\nI just want to say that I'm very petty. So I would likely do something like go to the wedding. But as they are off having pics made, and  everyone is arriving at the reception, I would announce very loudly that \"I would LOVE to stay for the party but as MY HUSBAND wasn't allowed to attend because of my BIGOT PARENTS, I must bid you all adieu because I can't bare to be without MY HUSBAND a moment longer.\"", "NTA. They are the ones being disrespectful by not inviting your husband.", "NTA, there\u2019s never going to be a \u201cgood time\u201d to do this in their book, especially if they\u2019ve been this way for 10 years. They\u2019re the ones making the wedding about their petty insecurities and prejudices. But I definitely think you should talk to your sister. If she wants you and your husband there, then she can extend an invite. Parents help with wedding stuff as a gift, not to control everything. Your parents treatment of you apparently doesn\u2019t bother her enough to give up mommy and daddy\u2019s money.", "NTA op. You not being there is absolutely the right thing to do in this case. I hope your parents enjoy your extended family and friends asking why you are not at the wedding.", "NTA. Im so sorry you are going through this. Your parents are homophobic. Please do not go without your husband. You are who you are, and they need to accept you for who you really are. They don't get to pray the gay away and pretend you're not in a committed relationship. \n\nAnd your aunt and uncle aren't supportive. If they were, they would boycott the wedding too", "\"I understand this is sisters big day but in support  of my loving husband it is highly inappropriate for you pretend this is acceptable. We, my husband and I, wish her and her husband to be all the best. Congratulations on your big day! We wish all the unconditional support and never-ending love they will recieve. Welcome to the family, brother in law :)\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou and hubby are a package deal. If they refuse to respect that and even try to act like the marriage/relationship doesn't exist by only inviting you to events, they will have to learn the hard way. It is both of you or neither of you. Personally I would consider it to be very rude towards my spouse if I'd go to an event where he is not invited to because my family looks down on him and my relationship/marriage. Your sister can be angry with or disappointed in your parents, you not going is a direct reaction to their action.", "NTA, but invitations are to the reception, not the wedding. Is the church not open to the public? You and the hubs can go for the wedding ceremony itself and skip the reception after. Then you're there for the important part at least--and hey you're already dressed up so go out to dinner as a date instead. Make sure to clear all that with your sister and other family members you think you think need input.", "NTA - And you should also make sure that the extended family knows why you're not there. Otherwise it would be too easy for them to answer the questions about your absence with something that paints you in a bad light.", "NTA\n\nSpouses get invited to weddings. If my spouse wasn't invited to a wedding, I wouldn't be going.\n\nYour family want to \"pretend to be straight\" at your sister's wedding, because they (or some of them) are the sort of conservative Christian that thinks being gay is sinful. \n\nTell your sister you love her, that you and your husband would love to celebrate her marriage, but that if you're not both invited (in aid of keeping the peace with homophobic family or friends), then you understand, and hope you can get together with her and her new husband at some other time to wish them well.", "So basically you dump your husband for the holidays with your family but the wedding is your hill to die on?", "NTA - I'd set a firm boundary that if your family behaves that way then you're not going to attend. I'm curious if it would also cause her stress to have her own son not attend and to have to explain why to her extended family.", "NTA don\u2019t attend if your husband isn\u2019t invited.  Sorry this happened.", "NTA\n\nThey are more worried about appearance than their child's feelings. \n\nWow, way to show the support.\n\nDon't go.", "Why is it not ok your family will be upset but no one cares if you are upset? Are you worth less than heterosexual?  Don't go to the wedding.  Wish your sister well.  She know why and it is all your families fault if they get upset.

You know the phrase \u2018of one racist joins 10 men at a table, you have 11 racists\u2019 - she can no longer say she is not homophobic if she enables homophobes, and that too for selfish reasons.

I think that you should tell Mom that you will no longer be attending **any** events without your husband.\n\nIf there's one place where you might be the asshole, it's this: You say say that you've been keeping the peace and dropping by for the holidays for years, but your partner has never been invited. I worry that your willingness to do this is an asshole move by you against your partner, and that it set the stage for the wedding issue. I mean, you've been a \"good boy\" and never raised a fuss after all of these years. You've trained our parents that you are willing to leave you \"dirty partner\" (their view, not mine!) home alone. Hence my advice to stop attending any events at all if your husband is not invited.", "NTA. Have some self-esteem and don't attend. The homophobia is explicit, and the bit about \"taking attention away from the brid\" is in them, not you. Where's the limit of this? Bringing a black spouse, if your family is white?\n\nAs for your sister, I understand the financial pressure and manipulation, plus probably the avoiding of conflict. But that's what doing the right thing is like: it hurts sometimes. It may even pit her against her husband. \n\nI'd explain this to her calmly and in a sad rather than accusatory tone, and then walk away.", "NTA - the only thing that is inappropriate is your parents behaviour. I also think your sister is not as supportive as she claims to be, if she really wanted you both there she could have stood her ground. Unless you and your husband were planning on rocking up in white dresses or announcing a pregnancy at the ceremony I fail to see how you are going to steal the spotlight!? But then homophobes always find some excuse to try and justify their shitty behaviour", "NTA.\nDon\u2019t go.", "NTA.

Your parents are assholes, and I know I would get married in the backyard with cucumber sandwiches before I let anyone I loved be excluded from my weddings, so frankly she is an asshole, too.\n\nFeel free to not only not go, but to declare far and wide why you are not there and who was involved in excluding your husband.", "NTA. But Id say go to the ceremony and not the reception. Then go low / no contact.", "NTA\n\n\"it would be inappropriate for me to not be there to support my sister on her big day\"\n\nIt would be inappropriate for your **husband** to not be invited.  I certainly would not attend if my spouse was purposely excluded.", "Nta", "Don't go cut contact", "It would be not be appropriate to overlook the bigotry you and your husband are being subjected to.\n\nYou are a couple and need to be treated as such. They can't have it all ways. \n\nNTA", "Think of your husband.  Do you know how heartbroken I would be if my husband went to an event that I was purposely excluded from. I understand you would like to be there for your sister, but your husband should come first.  Take a stand for him!!!", "NTA.\n\nYou could ask your sister if she would be fine if you turn up solo in a very gay suit.", "ESH - including you.\n\nRecognize that allowing your family to disrespect you and your husband for a period of years by excluding him means that you have fed into this trope.  By not making it clear early on that spouses of everyone in the family were going to be treated the same, and if they weren't than you simply wouldn't be participating, was disrespectful to your husband / family and delayed the confrontation to the point that you have less control of the narrative.  This should have been a non-negotiable point from the time that your relationship became exclusive and permanent, but certainly by the time you got married.\n\n**You** bear some of the blame for not addressing this when it came up, and now you have to deal with this during the red-letter event of your sister's wedding.  Make no mistake, it likely will take some of the attention off of your sister.  Had you had this issue out with your family earlier, it would have already been resolved.  For this, you owe your sister an apology.\n\n**Mom and Dad** \\-- Not attending isn't going to resolve this issue either - there will be talk if you aren't there, and the reason as to why.  I would make it clear to any and all that you aren't there because your parents are homophobic and have refused to allow your husband to attend.  Be unemotional and neutral in conveying this information, but don't back away from it in any way.  Mom still gets to deal with the fallout rather than avoiding / hiding, and it's no longer an issue that can be ignored.  I recommend a stock email to use over and over so your message is clear.  Send it even if you have a personal conversation with relatives whether they are supportive or not.\n\n**Your sister and her spouse** \\- this is time to put on her big-girl panties and act like an adult.  If she's going to be controlled by your parents, then she probably shouldn't be getting married, and you ought to make it clear that this is a crossroads in your relationship.  Bowing to their demands is going to irreparably damage your relationship with her and she ought to know this so she can make an informed decision.  If she's OK with that, well, she wasn't all that supportive after all.\n\nShe also ought to recognize that just because mom and dad are paying, they don't get to make all the decisions.  Oh, and here's the other thing - I'd bet dollars to donuts that they aren't going to cancel things and risk losing the deposits and having to pay.  Money almost always trumps religious conviction when it's directly coming out of someone's pocket, not to mention the fact that explaining a cancelled wedding to all of one's family and friends can result in a lot of unwanted attention as well.  Sis needs to take back her authority and be an adult.\n\n**Finally** \\- you have to use some common sense about things.  Have you talked to FBIL and your husband?  Do they have an opinion and what are their positions on it?  Also, if you do attend I would recommend against public displays of affection (PDA's) with your husband.  This isn't a time to make direct confrontational statements, but rather one to be somewhat subdued.  Don't kiss, hold hands or dance together.  Probably the one hill to die on at the ceremony would be pictures -- if other siblings / spouses are included, yours should be as well. Again, this is supposed to be your sister's special day and you don't want to take away from her day any more than necessary, but you don't want to be a doormat, either.\n\nGood Luck.\n\nOne final thought - have an escape plan.  Keep your car handy, hang onto the keys and park where you can make a quick exit if someone decides they are going to have a political / religious debate with you.  (Or at least a safe room you can go to).  Try not to engage with them, and leave if necessary.  Tell your sister that you will bug out if anyone gets argumentative, but will come back in for pics if she wants.  Keep your own safety and that of your husband uppermost in your mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - Formatting / Grammar", "NTA\n\nBut how much do you value your relationship with your sister?\n\nIf you avoid going to her wedding she will probably be hurt by this and it may put a strain on your relationship. She wanted to invite your husband and she isn\u2019t the problem here - your parents are. I would think carefully about whether it would be better to show up to the wedding solely for your sister\u2019s sake, or blow it off with the understanding that it may damage your relationship somewhat. \n\nIt is a real dilemma to be sure.", "Ask yourself a few questions. \n\n1. Who us the wedding about?\n2. Would I really want to introduce the love of my life to my family by throwing them In shark infested waters?\n3.

I'd hope she'd take a stand well before any of this was decided, or throw her veil (hat) in the ring and say she doesn't want to be married in a place that her family isn't welcome, maybe they should push the date back to see if the parents could possibly let her invite who she wants etc etc. It's lofty but obviously NOT possible in their current family dynamic.", "Yeah \ud83e\udd23! And then when the family gets all pissy \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude21, OP can act all innocent \ud83d\ude07 saying \"What's the problem? I just want them to be as happy as I am\".", "She doesn't need to, but she has the choice to. It's not her *fault* her family are bigots, but it's her *choice* to accept their bigotry as a condition of them funding the wedding.\n\nFor me, my sibling being treated as less than isn't an acceptable trade for the wedding of my dreams, and bigotry is less acceptable than a faux pas. For me, it's not about needing a 'reason to do it'. It's about there never being a reason to turn a blind eye to bigotry towards my sibling at my own wedding.", "I hope that one day soon, you will both feel comfortable hosting or attending your own holiday gatherings *together* with those loved ones who accept you exactly as you are. <3", "Friend, I am estranged from my family because they refused to accept my boundaries and be respectful of me, my husband, our parenting, etc\u2026and I can tell you that myself and every other person I know who is estranged from their family for reasons like mine and like yours are significantly happier for it.\n\nAnd I knew this in theory, but it wasn\u2019t until the first Christmas without my mom that I realized exactly how much of a difference it made. I actually ate Christmas dinner. And then i realized that for most of my teen and adult life I had been too stressed out to *eat Christmas dinner* because of my mother for most of my life. I\u2019d put my \u201cleftovers\u201d in a container with some more of the meal, and eat it hours later when I was no longer around her. I\u2019d never connected it to her behavior and the way she had made me feel until I was hosting my dearest friends and ate until I was bursting. \n\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice to spend a holiday where you don\u2019t have to perform your family\u2019s version of \u201cnormal\u201d? To stop hiding your true self and be with people who actually love you and want good things for you? \n\nCollect your Framily, start with your friends who have similar divides in their relationships with their parents or those who maybe can\u2019t travel to see their families.

It is just a get together of people to celebrate something like a birthday or a graduation, nothing more. Trying to pretend that it means more than just a party because you are part of a hate group doesn't make it true.", "I completely agree with this! You need to know and stand by your boundaries and don't let others try to gaslight or manipulate you because it makes them feel more comfortable or their lives easier. It reveals how much or how little they actually care about you and now you know who are the people you should invest in (which is not always your family sadly). Not saying you have to cut them off but by having boundaries that prioritize the people who truly love you, in the long-run you'll have a support network of people who want the best for you. \n\nYou let your family know where you stand, you've been accepting enough of their religious intolerance to not bring your partner to other family events so now it's their turn to respect your boundary of no longer wanting to ditch your husband especially for your sister's wedding. In general, it is completely unacceptable to exclude your sibling's husband at your wedding and just because they don't see your marriage as real or whatever, doesn't mean you have to live in whatever fake narrative they're trying to enforce on you. Your sister cares more about material and status than she does about your relationship so you're more than justified in choosing and fighting for your husband. Even though it's her wedding, it's your marriage and if they were really family they would respect that.", "She's prioritised her dream wedding over her brother, her brother should prioritise his husband over her wedding. If he goes to this wedding, he's letting his parents think he's okay with his husband being disrespected. \n\nShe gets to have her perfect wedding, and she and her parents can explain why OP isn't there (although OP should be prepared for them to make up a story that doesn't make him look good).", "TBH, i really don't think most people would put their principles over a dream wedding.\n\nI don't think shes a horrible person if she does not choose to either. But she also doesn't get to have everything she wants.\n\nThe sister, aunt, and uncle should be blaming the parents for OP's absence.", "The wedding will last a few hours, the brother is forever, not a hard choice", "I completely agree it\u2019s a shitty situation and op should focus on his husband. I was only saying that people telling that it\u2019s easy for the sister to cut her parent out of her life are not realist.\n\nBecause no it\u2019s not easy to cut out people that you love because they are asshole. Most of the time we live those people, they are part of our life and we see them often. Even more when we speak about parents that have loved you and supported you their whole life.", "NTA - Don't go. It is 2023 not 1953. Be proud of who you are and your marriage to a wonderfully, extremely patient man.", "Any chance for you and your sister to have a united front and speak with your parents?  \nYour sister can neutralize the center of attention argument and express how much she wants you both there.  And you can express how you\u2019re torn between two people you love.   Explain how you both want Your immediate family to  be a unit that links arms in solidarity.    Many occasions will come up in the future.

Your sister is not a complete AH for backing down on this issue and you are not the AH if you don\u2019t go. Remember advice is worth what you pay for it. So my worthless advice? If I was in your shoes if the wedding is local I\u2019d attend the ceremony and bail on the reception. Depending on how much you want to get your point across, you can greet/say goodbye to a select few family members and when they ask why you\u2019re not going to the reception tell them. I know in my extended family everyone would know in less than half an hour. But seriously listen to your heart and your husband not strangers. Good luck to you.", "I'll be the bad guy\n\nYTA\n\nYour sister is accepting of you, she wanted to invite your husband.  The only reason she is not is because your parents are paying.\n\nSo you are making her choose between the wedding being paid for, saving her a bunch of money which would likely put her in debt, or having you be there to see her get married.\n\nYou could ask to be seated away from the rest of your family and you could ask her to have a dinner with your husband and you at another time to try to include him more since he wasn't able to come.\n\nLike I don't know what the solution here for you is assuming you can't change the minds of your parents.  Do you want her to go tens of thousands of dollars in debt?  do you want her to give up what she wants in a wedding and get married at the courthouse in regular clothes? do you want to pitch in with the cost, so she doesn't need her parents money, so that your husband can be included?\n\nShe gets one day at a wedding and she wants the people that are important in her life there with her.  Now I'm sorry to say this but your husband isn't one of those people to her.  You yourself said that you are not particularly close to your family, you didn't include an exception for your sister there despite her accepting you and your husband.  So I'm assuming she barely knows him since he also isn't invited to holidays (again, not her fault).  But she wants you there and if you don't go, don't expect her to be attending important events in your future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso, she accepts you but you got married with just a few friends?  why not invite the family members that accept you?  like your aunt, uncle, and sister.  It seems like your parents don't accept you so you've written off family in general.", "Your choice is your choice. \n\nHowever, I will say I think its shitty that YOU don't have the balls to stand up to your parents (either of you really) about your relationship, but for this event, you have no problem drawing a line in the sand.  Like you are willing to hurt your sister because of your parents, but you clearly aren't willing to go against them yourself.", "I mean, th3 easy solution there is to just stop showing up til they relent.", "I think quite a few people are willing to do stuff they don't want when they are getting their wedding paid for.  Its easier said than done. \n\nI know quite a few people who had parents pay, and some of the conditions they put on it were crazy, but they couldn't afford the wedding without their help. \n\nSo while I agree, I don't necessarily think its quite as easy as you make it out to be", "If OP hasn't stood up to his parents why is it on his sister to do it?", "I agree!!", "\u201cAlly\u201d.\n\nCorrected it for you.", "Their parents are the type of Christians who are all about how they look. Their egos wouldn't allow them to back out because the wedding is more of a showcase for them than anything. Sister threatening to cancel would make them bend. However, that isn't a situation OP let alone husband should have to be in either.", "The 4 (bride, groom op and hubs) of them could also plot to mess with parents. It\u2019s very simple \u201chey bring hubs anyway, if mom makes a public sense it shows everyone she\u2019s a massive bigot\u201c which would be so funny, do nothing be low key, watch mom have a public tantrum because she likes pretending you are straight and single, rather then gay and married. lets sister spend bigot cash, exposes bigot publicly.", "Have your own holiday and invite all the people you care about", "OP, take everything you read here with a grain of salt. It's always easy for us to judge people from our armchair, when we have no stakes in the game.\n\nYou sister has everything to lose here, and she has probably weighed the pros and cons. Sadly your ire carries less weight than her parents' and possibly family friends' and in-laws'. It is what it is.\n\nI feel sorry for you, because you do not deserve this, but on the other hand maybe she doesn't deserve to have her life torpedoed by your \"conservative\" parents, either.\n\nI'd sit this one out, or maybe show up for the church wedding in the last minute, and leave right after you've congratulated them (or whatever you do after a church wedding these days), so people cannot chitchat with you - and skip the reception. This way you've supported her, but will not let yourself be drawn into conversations and this petty war of your parents.\n\nI think I will probably get downvoted to hell for this, but I hope you'll read this and consider my suggestion.\n\nI'd hate to burn my last bridge with my family, just because my sibling had to please multiple people with conflicting expectations.

Don't burn that bridge *just yet*.)", "Talk to your sister.

Now what ?", "100%\n\nThis is NOT the mom's wedding, but apparently, it is her way to brag and insist her way is the only way. Her not so Christian attitude should not be condoned. Let your sister know you love and support her, but you can not support your moms homophobia and hateful stance against your husband.\n\nYour sister is old enough. She knows this is wrong. Tell her you will stay home so she can have her dream wedding. Let her know you're not trying to give her a guilt trip, but you are refusing the reality set in place by your mom ( the one where just you exist and not your husband)."]}
