I was in that, it was filmed at a sleepover my daughter had here, I fell and slid down the muddy hill in our backyard. I was mortified and outraged.

I told her I don't care, one of those people is a disrespectful little shit and i feel hurt and i don't want to feel unsafe in my own home. My daughter has been distant and pouty.

That it's a matter of a lack of trust and accountability, and nobody has confessed that they did it either, so they haven't apologized and probably won't. \n\nNow, if one of them did fess up and apologize, I would allow them back.

Invite the kids over then play the video for them on the big screen and see who crumbles first, maybe it\u2019ll be the scare they need to not do it again.", "Your daughter knows exactly who filmed it, and exactly who posted it. You\u2019re being played.", "Why would you accidentally write sister? Even if you have been drinking?", "Oh yeah, I had fear when I asked but was determined not to google in public just in case.", "IANAL, but the number one rule with laws is to ask a local attorney who specializes in that area. Because asking an Environmental Lawyer in Kentucky about estate law in Vermont is not gonna work out well.", "Punished EVERYONE for one person's actions.\n\nKinda shitty OP.\nWho cares about a cringe comp\n\nBe the (figuratively) bigger person. Let it go \n\nElse, YBAA", "NTA but I would say that since you changed physically that time has significantly passed so it is not hard to believe that your daughter doesn\u2019t remember. If anything you can set the boundary to your daughter and her friends that you do not want anyone filming *you* in your home without your knowledge. \n\nI feel like Y T A if you do tell their parents seeing as time has passed by at least a few months I\u2019d assume, so it would not make sense to punish them for something they did so long ago that was just simply taking a video while hanging out with friends. In the event that you do find out the post was posted maliciously or submitted by one of the girls I would have a sit down with them and discuss the negatives of cringe culture and how social media can be very damaging to ones self worth. Mainly state what you said here: \u201cI was hurt that this video shows me in a uncomfortable position and that people outside of friends and family saw me like this.\u201d\n\n(I am assuming you worked out to lose weight but if it was through cosmetic means I acknowledge that your weight loss could have been more recent.)", "NTA! your daughter is friends with some very trash people.", "NTA...I have a obese mom...and if she would ever appear in those videos and I know anyone of my friends filmed it...I would do everything I can to make sure the video gets taken down and my friend apologizes.\n\nI adore my mom so much, so I feel terrible sorry.\n\nYour daughter will understand that the ban is justified one day", "Is it bad that I immediately thought the daughter did it herself for clout with her friends? And she\u2019s refusing to tell because she doesn\u2019t want to be in even more trouble now?", "Teenage girls are not monsters. but that was an awful thing to do.", "But from the timeline, this should have happened years ago. So... they weren't even teenagers.\nDoes it make any sense to punish a 14 year old for something that happened at 10 years old? They're like a completely different person by that point.", "It was filmed \u201cfive months ago\u201d, while the husband and kids were not in the country, but she \u201clet herself go\u201d after her husband passed away? This doesn\u2019t line up.", "Or can't face the social backlash.", "Her mom will probably force her daughter into ditching the friend if revelead who filmed it", "But what if that's offensive in the alien language!?", "And if they're in the minority, then they'll stay quiet. Then the daughter will hear about the blow up in the aftermath and they'll *absolutely* know who's responsible."]}
