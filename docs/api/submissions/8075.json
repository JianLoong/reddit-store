I told her I don't care, one of those people is a disrespectful little shit and i feel hurt and i don't want to feel unsafe in my own home. My daughter has been distant and pouty.

That it's a matter of a lack of trust and accountability, and nobody has confessed that they did it either, so they haven't apologized and probably won't. \n\nNow, if one of them did fess up and apologize, I would allow them back.
