The entire youtube channel has compilations of video clips aimed at mocking people. I don't think she runs the account, I think she posted the video somewhere and someone else reuploaded it to youtube in that compilation or she messaged them asking them to include this clip.  It has videos making fun of christians, atheists, rednecks, black people, fat people, feminists, incels, karens,  and many other groups of people. It was a video of fat people who were \"cringe\", usually talking about being how fat is healthy or fat people falling or otherwise just having accidents. I was in that, it was filmed at a sleepover my daughter had here, I fell and slid down the muddy hill in our backyard. I was mortified and outraged. I know it was one of my daughter's friends who filmed it since my daughter appeared in the film, the person filming was inside our fences yard and my husband and other kids were not in the country that day.\n\nMy daughter is supposed to have a sleepover this weekend and I told her I'm cancelling the sleepover because all 4 people who are coming are the people who were there last time. My daughter says its unfair and that she doens't know who filmed it and that she'll make them  promise not to film anything. I told her I don't care, one of those people is a disrespectful little shit and i feel hurt and i don't want to feel unsafe in my own home. My daughter has been distant and pouty. They are hosting the sleepover at another person's house and I'm letting my daughter go but she's still angry as our house is better (not sure why , their words). My daughter tells me she doesn't know who filmed it and I'm not sure i believe her.\n\nWould I be the asshole if i got the parents involved of her friends? they are all 13-14.\n\nEDIT: incase there's anyone who is out of touch with gen z and doesn't know what a cringe compilation is, like I didn't, its this.

I would try to get my kid to tell me who filmed & who uploaded. Then I'd go have a chat with that child's parents or all the parents if the bully wasn't named. \n\nThe parents may or may not take it seriously, but you've done what you can at that point. \n\nI'd make it clear to my daughter that there would be no more sleepovers with these kids until each one of the kids involved, including her, apologized to you personally for the unkind actions & invasion of your privacy. That means your daughter doesn't get to sleepover at anyone else's home either. She needs to learn that even being a bystander in this is wrong. She isn't innocent just because she wasn't holding the camera/phone. She has the power & duty to at the very least say \"This is wrong, I won't be involved.\"", "NTA at all. Things posted online are impossible to erase, so this has permanent consequences. These kids are also right at the age where they need to learn that this isn\u2019t okay. I would get the other parents involved and figure out who thought this was a good idea.\n\nSince your daughter is so young and is right at the age where kids being self-centered is normal and healthy, you may need to do some reframing to get her to understand. How would she feel if it was a cringe video about her? If it was a video making fun of her body that all her peers and the whole world was laughing at, would she want the person who posted it in her home?", "I would talk to the parents. \u201cMaybe\u201d they will take action and have their child delete the video.

I was once part of a mean girl crew, and I definitely wasn't innocent- there were 1 or 2 mean girl moments on my end as well, but I didn't realize just how nasty they could get until they started messing with some of our mutual friends & went the extra mile. I'm happy to say that eventually, I saw them for the mean girls that they were, and I let them go, even though it meant \"losing popularity.\" Your daughter may not realize just how hurtful they really can be, and that they can just as quickly turn on her & try to humiliate her in a similar way, etc.\n\nI would say to speak to her - let her know how it affected you, and that sometimes those people are the ones you have to be careful around, and may eventually turn on you as well. And also that you know it is her friends and her choice to stay friends with them, but that they definitely have a lot of growing up to do. That it's a matter of a lack of trust and accountability, and nobody has confessed that they did it either, so they haven't apologized and probably won't. \n\nNow, if one of them did fess up and apologize, I would allow them back. They're kids - and although the internet is forever, this is a teachable moment for them. \n\nJust my personal opinion!", "NTA\n\nThis is your house, and you should feel safe in it.", "NTA and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want them in my house, but you need to change your mindset from being ashamed of what you were, to being proud of how far you\u2019ve come since then. While it\u2019s not funny to mock the afflicted, it is a little bit funny to see someone sliding on their arse down a hillside. See the funny side and move on with your life - that happened to a different person.", "Video compilations on YouTube are not created by having people request their video be used in one. All the clips you see in a compilation come from unauthorised, pirated if you like, use of videos that have been posted anywhere on social media. The original owner of the video is generally not aware that it's being used in a compilation. It is nigh impossible to completely get rid of these.\n\nThis bit of information now out of the way, you are NTA. You were recorded by some as yet unknown person who posted the video without your permission. Different countries have different laws about this, however, most of the ones I looked at say it is illegal to do so because it violates privacy laws.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I would stand my ground regarding the no sleepovers at your house, I would even go one step further and deny sleepovers for my daughter until someone fesses up. She'll be pissed, but she will urge the one who posted in order to shorten her sentence of consequence. A good lecture on consent and privacy regarding recording and posting videos without consent would not be amiss. Please look these up. A Google search on \"posting videos without consent\" will get you started very well.\n\nResponsible use of social media should be taught in school at every level, at home too even before the age where a kid can sign up without fudging their age.", "Nta I'm sure your daughter knows who film it.
