I told her I don't care, one of those people is a disrespectful little shit and i feel hurt and i don't want to feel unsafe in my own home. My daughter has been distant and pouty.

And also that you know it is her friends and her choice to stay friends with them, but that they definitely have a lot of growing up to do. That it's a matter of a lack of trust and accountability, and nobody has confessed that they did it either, so they haven't apologized and probably won't. \n\nNow, if one of them did fess up and apologize, I would allow them back.

And here\u2019s why this is important: \n\nYour daughter might be either trapped in an abusive friendship or is T A \n\nMy own mother was very obese when I was your daughter\u2019s age, but I wasn\u2019t. Girls my age thought it was okay to mock my mother in front of me, and that I\u2019d join in because I wasn\u2019t fat. One of my friends was a little chubby for our age, and her mother was also morbidly obese. She would join in with the mocking of our mothers and even encourage this because it meant she knew they weren\u2019t saying that about her. I eventually told them off and lost my \u201cfriend\u201d. My chubby friend ended up developing an eating disorder from trying to lose the weight to avoid being made fun of. \nI\u2019m glad now I that I stuck up for my mother, but there were times back then when I wished I\u2019d just stayed quiet so I\u2019d have friends still. It was hard.\nYou need to have a talk with your daughter because she is either trying to avoid being harassed, or she\u2019s a jerk who is also harassing people.", "I don\u2019t blame you that\u2019s so trashy if those kids to do.", "NTA BUT you missed an opportunity to have them all be stuck at your house while you educate them on why this is abhorrent", "NTA but you shouldn't let her have sleepovers at their homes either until this is properly addressed. Your daughter **does know** who filmed it and she gives me the impression that she happily goes along with this vitriol towards you so long as it solidifies her social standing. \n\nThis is a matter of **respect** towards you now, and children that are allowed to routinely disrespect properly providing parents do **not** grow up into well-adjusted adults. There isn't only one disrespectful kid in that flock, they're all disrespectful. If you as a bystander witness unwarranted disrespect and do absolutely nothing about it, then you're no better than the person committing that disrespect to begin with. She's at the age now where she should start learning that lesson. \n\nIf trying to have a reasonable conversation with her about this isn't working, and she just doesn't care about how you feel, then it's time for some of her privileges to be slashed until she can confess that she understands that this was disrespectful and hurtful to you. \n\nFrom this point on, every time she acts up something along the lines of this can be said in response: \"In this life, you can only expect people to treat you as well as you treat others. You treat your own mother with rudeness and disrespect, so why exactly do you think you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect by the very people you keep hurting? When you are trusted to make the right decisions and behave with decency towards others, you get access to privileges like unsupervised phone time, internet access, and having a say in a household that you do not contribute to. When you break the trust that is given to you, then you lose those privileges. If you want those privileges back, then you need to earn them by demonstrating good character and learning from your mistakes. If you refuse to do that, then you are proving exactly why you do not deserve these privileges any longer.\"\n\nI cannot emphasize enough that if you allow her to set the precedent that it's okay to disrespect you, then it will continue to get worse and worse from here and she will genuinely believe she is entitled to treat you like this while still being deserving of whatever she wants.", "I mean I don't think you're an AH, but like as far as I can tell, one of your daughter's friends posted a video taken at a sleepover somewhere online, and then **someone else** has taken this to use maliciously? If you've since become thin from \"morbidly obese\" then this must have been a couple of years ago at least ergo the girl in question was about 11/12 years old? \n\nIdk I wouldn't personally ban all of them from the house over this, but I would get in touch with their parents. Its a good lesson that they shouldn't post online without permission but if they didn't intend it to be making fun of you I do think it's a bit harsh. \n\nIf you think it was posted with the intent of making fun of you then banning them is fair. Reading this, I'm not really sure what you think the original video was doing online.", "NTA, and it's impossible to edit a reddit post title (unless you're an admin).", "Coming from another parent, I would not let her go to that sleepover.

You\u2019re coming from a place of hurt, and I get that you don\u2019t want anything to do with the person who hurt you.  But I do want to point out, while it was never appropriate to record and post any video without your knowledge and consent, it\u2019s highly unlikely your daughter\u2019s friend made that cringe compilation.  The original posting of the video may well have been innocuous in the friend\u2019s mind.  Kids don\u2019t have a concept of private versus public life anymore.  They probably posted something funny (someone slid down a hill) that happened during their daily life and forgot about it, not realizing someone else was going to steal that video and reframe it as fatphobic cringe.\n\nTLDR there\u2019s a good chance the friend did not actually post it in a mean spirited way.  But it still shouldn\u2019t have been posted in the first place.", "Info:\n\nHave you looked for the original video? I'm guessing it was probably less malicious than the final posting. \"Person falls down\" is a pretty common video trope. While you shouldn't post clips of a person without their permission, I could see a young teen just thinking it was a funny moment and not thinking that someone else may dislike being on the Internet or that the clip may be repurposed for more malicious purposes. \n\nI do think this would be a good educational moment to talk to the girls about why it's wrong to post without permission and what can happen to these types of clips. \n\nWhile I think it would be justified to cancel an even or put a temporary ban (unless someone comes forward, in which case the ban would only extend to them), I don't think I'd make a permanent ban just yet. These girls are young and unless other info about the original video becomes available, I do think this was probably more about poor judgement than trying to intentionally hurt someone.", "NTA!  None of those girls should be welcome in your house again.  What a rotten thing to do.  The hell with them!", "NTA\n\nYou are being far too nice about this.
