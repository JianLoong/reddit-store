{"id": 3271, "submission_id": "z56wgn", "title": "AITA asking my wife to pay for my daughter's birthday", "selftext": "My wife (Maddi) have been together for 5 years. I have a daughter, Rachel (14) and son, Mitch (11) from my previous relationship and a stepdaughter Talia (14). We always have had separate finances and originally had similar paying jobs. While hers has definitely become better than mine, we have stayed as we are, aside from shared expenses being split more equally.\n\nAround 7 months ago we found out Rachel is sick. I've been doing everything I can for her, trying to help her and the best treatment I can afford. But the issue is I can't. I'm draining my savings and can barely afford more basic treatment. I can pay for necessities and treatment, but nothing else. Maddi has been financially fine throughout. She's paying more of the necessities, but she's constantly buying Talia things, taking her out, letting her do things that I can't do for either of my children. I know we agreed to have separate finances, and it's not wrong per se. But its definitely been causing some confict, though I've tried hard to work it out. I know that it's my responsibility, but it's just not working well. I can't afford extracurriculars or for them to go out with friends or special dinners or anything. \n\nRachel's birthday is coming up, and I want to do something nice while we can. I asked Maddi for help, if she can cover her birthday because I can't. But Maddi refused. She is paying almost all the essentials, and doesn't think she should have to pay for this. That she knows I can't pay her back and it's my responsibility. \n\nI understand all that, but it's not fair. I'm not asking for my own sake. Rachel and Mitch are already missing out on so much, and I know how horrible Rachel feels. I just want this one good special night for her.\n\nEDIT\n\nA few people didn't understand. Rachel is terminal. This is likely her last birthday which is why I want it to be a real one.\n\nAlso I was told to add this: Maddi currently earns 2.5X as much as me (doesn't have medical expenses obviously) and pays 80% of the necessities\n\nIgnore the 1-2k. It's not accurate. My budgeting method makes more sense in practise since having more money saved than needed is never bad. But clearly it doesn't work here.\n\n\n*EDIT 2!!!\n\nIM SORRY IM BAD AT MATH, ALRIGHT\n\nPretend I said 500. \n\nI don't actually need 2k, the 1-2k was clearly dumb, because I wasn't going to whip a calculator out for an AITA post. Christ's sake it's not a relevant arguement. I DIDN'T ASK FOR 1-2k from Maddi, it was just a stupid throwaway estimate I made here", "created_utc": 1669467298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z56wgn/aita_asking_my_wife_to_pay_for_my_daughters/", "score": 704, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So for the title question, you're fine however your wife has steadily taken on more of the essentials until she's paying for all of it if I'm not reading it wrong.  You want her to pay all the living expenses plus all the extracurriculars and holiday presents.  Christmas is right around the corner and you can't afford a birthday party.  \n\nWhere is your daughter's mother in this?  Have you even looked for a better job with better benefits or does each time something comes up you expect your wife to shoulder the burden?", "NAH - You're not an asshole for asking , she's not an asshole for sticking to your original arrangement.  Plus you said she's paying all the essentials, so it sounds like she's already contributing to shared expenses.  Guilt tripping her would make you an asshole.\n\nThat being said, I'm curious about your relationships with each others' step kids.  There's a difference between separate finances and separate families.  Your wife has known Rachel for 5+ years. Do they not have a connection at this point?", "YTA.  Soft YTA.  I\u2019m sorry about your situation.  That being said, asking for 1-2k for a birthday is a lot.  Your wife is stepping up, paying 80% of household expenses for what I\u2019m guessing is an extended amount of time.  Instead of showing appreciation for this you are asking for more and now asking strangers if she is an asshole.  No, you are being entitled.  Did you consider that she may have had to put off some of her own savings to cover for you?  Have you ever shown her any gratitude?  It\u2019s a tough time and it maybe difficult to hear but she is being supportive.", "Per your comments,  your wife is paying 80% percent of the essentials and she makes 2.5x more than you. Very precise. \n\nThen you want a couple thousand dollars for a birthday but defend yourself by saying you aren't good with numbers and in the past, bought what you wanted without keeping track of the cost. You also freely admit you can't/won't pay her back.\n\nI have a feeling your wife is saying no because otherwise you will drain her accounts the way you have drained your own. And I don't think it's out of greed,  just carelessness.\n\nI'm not gonna call a father with a sick child an asshole,  but I'm also not going to call a woman with a child an asshole either for prioritizing her financial security and her own child.\n\nI'm sorry your daughter is sick but if you are as careless as you appear in the comments,  I don't blame your wife for saying no. She has to look out for herself and her daughter the same way you have to look out for your kids.\n\nNAH", "INFO where is the biological mother in all of this? Can she contribute?", "INFO - I feel like there\u2019s something more that you\u2019re not saying. Did you all have a fight in the beginning about the kids? Are you constantly borrowing money? There\u2019s another reason beyond not wanting to help with a birthday party. Is your relationship rocky where she wouldn\u2019t want to help knowing you\u2019re on your way out? \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but there has to be something more here.", "INFO: How much of your family expenses is your wife currently paying? You already told us that she pays more than half, since she has a higher salary, and she's also paying for all of the necessities. How much is she actually paying?", "YTA  but let me cushion that by saying understandably. Of course you are desperately worried about your child and wan5 to do everything you can for her but you made financial agreement and have admitted that your wife is already carrying mioe than her fair share of the financial load ALLLOWING you to financially contribute to your daughters care. Is it really fair of you to ask for even more. The reason she may be spoiling the other children a bit is because often when there is a sick child in the family all the attention tends to go to that child because of course they need extra, however that doesn't eliminate the other children's need for care and attention and focus. It sounds to me like your wife is trying to balance everything and keep your home and family running while leaving you the time and your own money to deal with your daughters health crisis.", "I just really feel like there is more to the story", "Okay I\u2019m going slight YTA, and that\u2019s only because of the **it\u2019s not fair** line at the end.\n\nYou were within your rights to ask your wife, she is within her rights to say now. It\u2019s sucks, but that\u2019s life.\n\nYou and your wife agreed to and established separate finances, with the expectation that you would each handle the things you must pay for. So how is he being unfair??\n\nTo be fair, your wife is supporting you and your children by paying for the house. So you then need to budget the money you were using toward the fun you want to have.\n\nWhere your daughters mom?? Extended family?? Charities for children of her illness??\n\n**Your wife isn\u2019t the only means of support, only the most convenient for you.**", "That's rough.\n\nEither you're a family or you're not. If you're a family, you treat all your kids equally, even if you keep separate finances.\n\nYour wife seems to be saying you are not a family, but some kind of financially-contingent alliance where her money goes to her daughter only.\n\nAnd that's.... well that could be a lot of things, but to me, it's not a family. If she wanted to keep things so separate, she shouldn't have married and become your kids' stepmom.\n\nIf she was saying to tone down the expenses on the birthday because it doesn't work budget wise, yeah ok, I'd understand. But refusing flat out is pretty harsh.\n\nINFO though, how much are we talking here?", "NTA, may I ask what Rachels illness is? There may be many grants to help with medical bills.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to ask, but if you pressure her then you will be. She\u2019s paying 80% of things already, that\u2019s a lot for someone to be paying. If you don\u2019t have money to make a cake, get some pizza, and a couple of presents, unfortunately that\u2019s not on her to do. You guys had an agreement and she\u2019s sticking to it. I\u2019m sorry about your daughter.", "YTA \n\nI don't think you asking the question was bad, but this situation cannot be too much of a surprise?\n\nIt seems like your wife is following the financial agreement that you both agreed on. And it seems like she is taking it more seriously than you. Even with the circumstance of your terminally ill daughter.\n\nI would suggest re-evaluating your financial agreement. Do you have a joint bank account?\n\nAlso, someone commented that you should work on your money management skills. I spent some time reading the comments and your remarks on how much you thought a birthday party would be was surprising. I think that since this is the first time where you need to be more careful with how money is spent, you don't have much of an idea on how to spend it/costs of things. And if you were spending money before on a birthday and not paying much attention to how much you were spending, well I would call that privileged. \n\nLastly, maybe some sort of counseling could be helpful for the family. Being in a family is all about supporting each other. But it seems like the financial agreement made in the past, is encouraging the divide. It's like your wife and Talia are on one team, and you and your children on the other.", "YTA\n\nYou've repeatedly said that you're bad with numbers and that the separate finances were just easier, but I wouldn't be surprised if your wife wanted to avoid your apparent inability to do simple arithmetic. If your budget is really THAT tight, why the hell aren't you putting more effort into actually making a budget. You should know exactly how much of your share your wife is paying. You should know exactly how much you'd like to spend on the party. \n\nYou just sound entitled to me. It sucks your daughter's bills are hard to pay, but it sounds like you've just decided your wife can handle it and whatever you manage to contribute is good enough. You made an arrangement and complained when it stopped being good for you. Would you have covered your wife's expenses were the situation reversed? If so, why the hell would you have separate finances in the first place?", "NTA. Refusing to pay for your sick step-child\u2019s birthday when you are perfectly capable of doing so is pretty harsh. Though I think it\u2019s time you and your wife sit down for a more serious conversation, as one part of the family enjoying a much nicer lifestyle than the other is going to start fostering resentment, especially between the kids.", "INFO:  If you are in the US, have you tried reaching out to Make A Wish or a similar organization that provides special experiences for children with life-threatening illnesses? \n\nThe trips to Disney get the most publicity, but they fulfill other wishes, too. Adapted bicycles, meeting celebrities, visiting a firehouse\u2014whatever the kid\u2019s wish is, they do their best to fulfill it. If your daughter\u2019s wish is a blow out birthday party, they could do that. Or maybe there is some other special occasion/event/place/thing she might like instead.\n\nIt is worth looking into.", "I really don\u2019t want to judge. This is a sad situation, but I\u2019m leaning NTA. I get that your wife is paying 80% of essentials now, but she also makes 2.5x more, so that\u2019s not horribly unreasonable, even without your added medical bills in the picture. Still, she\u2019s shouldering a lot, and you don\u2019t seem to a great grasp on finances from your comments. But it might be your daughter\u2019s last birthday, and I\u2019d be moving heaven and earth to try to give her a good one in your wife\u2019s shoes. And that\u2019s the reason that\u2019s really behind my judgment in the end. \n\nAll that said, I think you can make a great, memorable birthday on a shoestring budget. I know this isn\u2019t an advice sub, but a girl\u2019s birthday is at stake, so here you go. You absolutely do not need $1k or more to throw her a great one. Think about doing things like a city-wide scavenger hunt with a time limit and done in groups, a \u201cspa night\u201d at home with her friends with cheap masks, lotions, and a few bottles of nail polish, or do something at the local park/beach/etc. You might want to think about whether you or your friends or neighbors have any talents that lend themselves to a class\u2014instant art party, craft party, makeup tutorial party. Ask on social media if you\u2019re unsure\u2014I\u2019m guessing you have friends or acquaintances who\u2019d be honored to help. The dollar store is your friend when it comes to decor, supplies or prizes. And look up budget-friendly birthday ideas on the internet\u2014there are lots of ideas out there. Maybe one will be perfect for your daughter. \n\nOne last thought: Your wife might be more willing to help with a low-budget and well-thought-out idea presented with hard numbers rather than offering to cover the sort of nebulous high cost you originally had in mind.", "NAH....but no is no. It really isn't like she isn't doing quite a bit to lighten your load. I personally would think it'd be automatic terminal or not but.... y'all hear an agreement and apparently she's a stickler \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0fi wish things were different for your baby tho...i really do.", "YTA for your attitude with money management from the comments. Dude, if these \"estimates\" and money counting are how you usually deal with matters like that, I can easily see why Maddi doesn't want to cover your expenses, or why you can't scrape enough to cover them yourself. Seriously, put some thought into budgeting. How can you not know the rough estimate of how much a kid's birthday costs if you did the same last year?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: You haven't even asked for an itemized bill from a hospital. I bet you haven't even tried to reduce the medical bills or set up a payment plan in any other, perfectly mundane way. Of course your wife doesn't trust you with money, you really are bad with it, and don't want to make a minimum effort to do some research. Newsflash, most people don't have lawyers, they have patience, persistence, and common sense when it comes to medical bills.", "NTA. It's actually really worrying that Maddi won't do something nice for her stepdaughter. Her attitude sucks, frankly.\n\nYou set up a gofundme or something, I'd happily donate to that and I'm sure a lot other people would too.", "NAH. It seems you are both stretched to the max. with you paying for medical expenses and your wife paying almost all the essentials. It is not fair for you to ask her to take stuff away from your stepdaughter, to pay for a party for your daughter. Both girls, and your son, are deserving of nice things. I am so sorry, you are in this predicament, and I hope you find a way to make a nice birthday celebration for your daughter anyway. Please remember that it is not necessarily the money poured into an event that decides whether it becomes a good day or not.", "NTA that\u2019s her stepdaughter. I\u2019m shocked she hasn\u2019t offered to do more. I can\u2019t imagine having step children and the money to help and not wanting to. Plus she\u2019s sick. Like??? Are there other issues in this marriage/family? Can\u2019t imagine this is the one thing she\u2019s heartless about.", "NTA. Honestly, for something like this, only an AH wouldn't budge. I can't imagine saying you don't want to help a sick kid have a decent birthday just because \"wE pRoMiSeD tO kEeP FiNaNcEs sEpArAte\". Like, fuck, come to a deal on washing dishes or *something*", "I'm gonna say NTA here, but it seems like there are bigger problems in this family. Part of being a family is looking out for one another, and while I don't think Maddi is obligated to pay for Rachel's birthday, I do wonder why she doesn't *want* to. Talia is her child and it makes sense that Maddi would dote on her a little more, but its strange to me that Maddi wouldn't want to at least make sure Rachel has a nice birthday, especially when she sounds like she's not having a great time. Do you feel like maybe there's some resentment Maddi has from your children being a part of a previous relationship, or (and I mean this nicely) are you not being honest with how much of the cost of living Maddi is having to pay?", "NTA - this isn\u2019t a partnership. I\u2019d do this for a friend, let alone my husband and his sick child. I think her true colors are showing and they\u2019re ugly.", "YTA based on your responses. You can ask, but she is not a bad person for saying no and that is obviously what you want all if us to say. You want all of us to shame your wife into paying. She is already covering 80% of the bills - that\u2019s a lot. You don\u2019t appear to appreciate that at all.", "NTA\n\nHow much money are you looking for? Do you have any extended family around to help? Is bio mom in the picture? This seems like a situation where the entire family would want to rally around to help out. Maddi obviously is not planning on helping... which I think it\u2019s bizarre but that\u2019s her choice. You need to find other options.... And perhaps a better life partner\n\nETA based on the fact you used the word \u201cgreedy\u201d makes me believe there\u2019s more to this story.  No one would be considered \u201cgreedy\u201d for wanting to make their daughter\u2019s bday special", "NTA\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable for you to ask for financial help for your daughter's (potentially last) birthday. That being said, $1000+ is waaaaay too much to spend on a birthday party imo.\n\nYou could always try doing a fundraiser like a bottle drive to raise money as well!", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ll never understand this separate finance thing for married couples. It\u2019s icky. But the larger issue here is that your wife doesn\u2019t want to help you or your sick daughter. You should not even have had to ask. She\u2019s showing you the kind of person she is. Ball is in your court.\n\nHoping for the very best outcome for your daughter.", "YTA where is your childrens other biological parent!!! Your wife is already picking up where you are lacking when it comes to necessities.", "You\u2019re NTA, but I think your wife is. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how you can be married to someone, know their child is going to die, and not want to do a nice thing for the step child because ultimately you\u2019re not really doing it for the child, you\u2019re doing it to make your partner happy. And her partner is rightly miserable rn.\n\nHonestly this would make me question the relationship.

She's not obligated, but I would class this as an AH thing to do.\n\nAnd before people start piling on to the fact she's paying for 80% or the necessities, let me ask: so what? Isn't that what marriage is about? In sickness and in health? For richer or poorer? And even if we don't consider that, she makes 2.5x what OP makes. In plenty of relationships she would be paying more than half of the joint costs permanently to make things equitable. And if that doesn't change your mind, this is just temporary. The kid is terminal. She won't see her next birthday. So it's not like this financial arrangement will last. She'll be back to paying only half in no time.", "I\u2019m going with NTA bc Rachel is terminal\n\nHave you looked into any non profits or organizations that help create special moments for terminally ill children?

But in all honesty, I think this isn't a situation where internet validation will be very helpful to you. I think you're in a very difficult spot, and you have a partner who isn't helping you in a way that makes you feel safe and supported. This is the kind of situation that makes or breaks relationships. To that end, does it really matter if she's within her right to refuse help?\n\nI'd gently suggest that rather than trying to convince your wife to support you in a way that you need, focus on loving your daughter as much as possible and seek out support from people who are willing to support you in a way that feels right to you. Be with her. If she's as much a daddy's girl as you say, I can't imagine a better birthday than spending time with you.\n\nThe rest you can sort out in time. I'd also suggest individual therapy if you can get it, but keeping in regular communication with friends and family who love you would be good regardless.\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry, OP.", "NTA I think you are overwhelmed.

First off I'm so sorry that your daughter is terminal. I'm presuming she has cancer. Have you checked out St. Jude's? It's FREE. They accept all types of childhood cancer. Alot of local hospitals now have a St. Jude's wing. If you end up having to go to Memphis, they literally pay for a hotel or apartment for you. If they get your cancer in remission, it doesn't matter how old you are after that they treat your cancer. I raised tons of money in high school for them, and one of my best friends in school went there for her leukemia. She unfortunately (unfortunately doesn't do it it justice :( ) didn't make it. But they provided a fully furnished apartment while she was there on chemo and that was in the 1990s. \n\n2nd. Check out Medicaid. They normally automatically provide it when the diagnosis is terminal. My late husband had kidney cancer and we didn't have to pay a dime. And most providers will still see you while the application is processing. He even had spinal surgery (cancer spread to his bones) while it was pending. \n\n3rd. Check out make a wish.  They are so amazing! It won't necessarily be a birthday party, but something fun she can do. \n\n4th. Please check out social security disability.
