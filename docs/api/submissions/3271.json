I have a daughter, Rachel (14) and son, Mitch (11) from my previous relationship and a stepdaughter Talia (14). We always have had separate finances and originally had similar paying jobs. While hers has definitely become better than mine, we have stayed as we are, aside from shared expenses being split more equally.\n\nAround 7 months ago we found out Rachel is sick. I've been doing everything I can for her, trying to help her and the best treatment I can afford. But the issue is I can't. I'm draining my savings and can barely afford more basic treatment. I can pay for necessities and treatment, but nothing else. Maddi has been financially fine throughout. She's paying more of the necessities, but she's constantly buying Talia things, taking her out, letting her do things that I can't do for either of my children. I know we agreed to have separate finances, and it's not wrong per se. But its definitely been causing some confict, though I've tried hard to work it out. I know that it's my responsibility, but it's just not working well. I can't afford extracurriculars or for them to go out with friends or special dinners or anything. \n\nRachel's birthday is coming up, and I want to do something nice while we can. I asked Maddi for help, if she can cover her birthday because I can't. But Maddi refused. She is paying almost all the essentials, and doesn't think she should have to pay for this. That she knows I can't pay her back and it's my responsibility. \n\nI understand all that, but it's not fair. I'm not asking for my own sake. Rachel and Mitch are already missing out on so much, and I know how horrible Rachel feels. I just want this one good special night for her.\n\nEDIT\n\nA few people didn't understand. Rachel is terminal. This is likely her last birthday which is why I want it to be a real one.\n\nAlso I was told to add this: Maddi currently earns 2.5X as much as me (doesn't have medical expenses obviously) and pays 80% of the necessities", "created_utc": 1669467298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z56wgn/aita_asking_my_wife_to_pay_for_my_daughters/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So for the title question, you're fine however your wife has steadily taken on more of the essentials until she's paying for all of it if I'm not reading it wrong.  You want her to pay all the living expenses plus all the extracurriculars and holiday presents.  Christmas is right around the corner and you can't afford a birthday party.  \n\nWhere is your daughter's mother in this?  Have you even looked for a better job with better benefits or does each time something comes up you expect your wife to shoulder the burden?", "NAH - You're not an asshole for asking , she's not an asshole for sticking to your original arrangement.  Plus you said she's paying all the essentials, so it sounds like she's already contributing to shared expenses.  Guilt tripping her would make you an asshole.\n\nThat being said, I'm curious about your relationships with each others' step kids.  There's a difference between separate finances and separate families.  Your wife has known Rachel for 5+ years. Do they not have a connection at this point?", "YTA.  Soft YTA.  I\u2019m sorry about your situation.  That being said, asking for 1-2k for a birthday is a lot.  Your wife is stepping up, paying 80% of household expenses for what I\u2019m guessing is an extended amount of time.  Instead of showing appreciation for this you are asking for more and now asking strangers if she is an asshole.  No, you are being entitled.  Did you consider that she may have had to put off some of her own savings to cover for you?  Have you ever shown her any gratitude?  It\u2019s a tough time and it maybe difficult to hear but she is being supportive.", "Per your comments,  your wife is paying 80% percent of the essentials and she makes 2.5x more than you. Very precise. \n\nThen you want a couple thousand dollars for a birthday but defend yourself by saying you aren't good with numbers and in the past, bought what you wanted without keeping track of the cost. You also freely admit you can't/won't pay her back.\n\nI have a feeling your wife is saying no because otherwise you will drain her accounts the way you have drained your own. And I don't think it's out of greed,  just carelessness.\n\nI'm not gonna call a father with a sick child an asshole,  but I'm also not going to call a woman with a child an asshole either for prioritizing her financial security and her own child.\n\nI'm sorry your daughter is sick but if you are as careless as you appear in the comments,  I don't blame your wife for saying no. She has to look out for herself and her daughter the same way you have to look out for your kids.\n\nNAH", "INFO where is the biological mother in all of this? Can she contribute?", "INFO - I feel like there\u2019s something more that you\u2019re not saying. Did you all have a fight in the beginning about the kids? Are you constantly borrowing money? There\u2019s another reason beyond not wanting to help with a birthday party. Is your relationship rocky where she wouldn\u2019t want to help knowing you\u2019re on your way out? \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but there has to be something more here.", "INFO: How much of your family expenses is your wife currently paying? You already told us that she pays more than half, since she has a higher salary, and she's also paying for all of the necessities. How much is she actually paying?", "YTA  but let me cushion that by saying understandably. Of course you are desperately worried about your child and wan5 to do everything you can for her but you made financial agreement and have admitted that your wife is already carrying mioe than her fair share of the financial load ALLLOWING you to financially contribute to your daughters care. Is it really fair of you to ask for even more. The reason she may be spoiling the other children a bit is because often when there is a sick child in the family all the attention tends to go to that child because of course they need extra, however that doesn't eliminate the other children's need for care and attention and focus. It sounds to me like your wife is trying to balance everything and keep your home and family running while leaving you the time and your own money to deal with your daughters health crisis.", "I just really feel like there is more to the story", "Okay I\u2019m going slight YTA, and that\u2019s only because of the **it\u2019s not fair** line at the end.\n\nYou were within your rights to ask your wife, she is within her rights to say now. It\u2019s sucks, but that\u2019s life.\n\nYou and your wife agreed to and established separate finances, with the expectation that you would each handle the things you must pay for. So how is he being unfair??\n\nTo be fair, your wife is supporting you and your children by paying for the house. So you then need to budget the money you were using toward the fun you want to have.\n\nWhere your daughters mom?? Extended family?? Charities for children of her illness??\n\n**Your wife isn\u2019t the only means of support, only the most convenient for you.**", "That's rough.\n\nEither you're a family or you're not. If you're a family, you treat all your kids equally, even if you keep separate finances.\n\nYour wife seems to be saying you are not a family, but some kind of financially-contingent alliance where her money goes to her daughter only.\n\nAnd that's.... well that could be a lot of things, but to me, it's not a family. If she wanted to keep things so separate, she shouldn't have married and become your kids' stepmom.\n\nIf she was saying to tone down the expenses on the birthday because it doesn't work budget wise, yeah ok, I'd understand. But refusing flat out is pretty harsh.\n\nINFO though, how much are we talking here?", "NTA, may I ask what Rachels illness is? There may be many grants to help with medical bills.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to ask, but if you pressure her then you will be. She\u2019s paying 80% of things already, that\u2019s a lot for someone to be paying. If you don\u2019t have money to make a cake, get some pizza, and a couple of presents, unfortunately that\u2019s not on her to do. You guys had an agreement and she\u2019s sticking to it. I\u2019m sorry about your daughter.", "YTA \n\nI don't think you asking the question was bad, but this situation cannot be too much of a surprise?\n\nIt seems like your wife is following the financial agreement that you both agreed on. And it seems like she is taking it more seriously than you. Even with the circumstance of your terminally ill daughter.\n\nI would suggest re-evaluating your financial agreement. Do you have a joint bank account?\n\nAlso, someone commented that you should work on your money management skills. I spent some time reading the comments and your remarks on how much you thought a birthday party would be was surprising. I think that since this is the first time where you need to be more careful with how money is spent, you don't have much of an idea on how to spend it/costs of things. And if you were spending money before on a birthday and not paying much attention to how much you were spending, well I would call that privileged. \n\nLastly, maybe some sort of counseling could be helpful for the family. Being in a family is all about supporting each other. But it seems like the financial agreement made in the past, is encouraging the divide. It's like your wife and Talia are on one team, and you and your children on the other.", "YTA\n\nYou've repeatedly said that you're bad with numbers and that the separate finances were just easier, but I wouldn't be surprised if your wife wanted to avoid your apparent inability to do simple arithmetic. If your budget is really THAT tight, why the hell aren't you putting more effort into actually making a budget. You should know exactly how much of your share your wife is paying. You should know exactly how much you'd like to spend on the party. \n\nYou just sound entitled to me. It sucks your daughter's bills are hard to pay, but it sounds like you've just decided your wife can handle it and whatever you manage to contribute is good enough. You made an arrangement and complained when it stopped being good for you. Would you have covered your wife's expenses were the situation reversed? If so, why the hell would you have separate finances in the first place?", "NTA. Refusing to pay for your sick step-child\u2019s birthday when you are perfectly capable of doing so is pretty harsh. Though I think it\u2019s time you and your wife sit down for a more serious conversation, as one part of the family enjoying a much nicer lifestyle than the other is going to start fostering resentment, especially between the kids.", "INFO:  If you are in the US, have you tried reaching out to Make A Wish or a similar organization that provides special experiences for children with life-threatening illnesses? \n\nThe trips to Disney get the most publicity, but they fulfill other wishes, too. Adapted bicycles, meeting celebrities, visiting a firehouse\u2014whatever the kid\u2019s wish is, they do their best to fulfill it. If your daughter\u2019s wish is a blow out birthday party, they could do that. Or maybe there is some other special occasion/event/place/thing she might like instead.\n\nIt is worth looking into.", "I really don\u2019t want to judge. This is a sad situation, but I\u2019m leaning NTA. I get that your wife is paying 80% of essentials now, but she also makes 2.5x more, so that\u2019s not horribly unreasonable, even without your added medical bills in the picture. Still, she\u2019s shouldering a lot, and you don\u2019t seem to a great grasp on finances from your comments. But it might be your daughter\u2019s last birthday, and I\u2019d be moving heaven and earth to try to give her a good one in your wife\u2019s shoes. And that\u2019s the reason that\u2019s really behind my judgment in the end. \n\nAll that said, I think you can make a great, memorable birthday on a shoestring budget. I know this isn\u2019t an advice sub, but a girl\u2019s birthday is at stake, so here you go. You absolutely do not need $1k or more to throw her a great one. Think about doing things like a city-wide scavenger hunt with a time limit and done in groups, a \u201cspa night\u201d at home with her friends with cheap masks, lotions, and a few bottles of nail polish, or do something at the local park/beach/etc. You might want to think about whether you or your friends or neighbors have any talents that lend themselves to a class\u2014instant art party, craft party, makeup tutorial party. Ask on social media if you\u2019re unsure\u2014I\u2019m guessing you have friends or acquaintances who\u2019d be honored to help. The dollar store is your friend when it comes to decor, supplies or prizes. And look up budget-friendly birthday ideas on the internet\u2014there are lots of ideas out there. Maybe one will be perfect for your daughter. \n\nOne last thought: Your wife might be more willing to help with a low-budget and well-thought-out idea presented with hard numbers rather than offering to cover the sort of nebulous high cost you originally had in mind.", "NAH....but no is no. It really isn't like she isn't doing quite a bit to lighten your load. I personally would think it'd be automatic terminal or not but.... y'all hear an agreement and apparently she's a stickler \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0fi wish things were different for your baby tho...i really do.", "YTA for your attitude with money management from the comments. Dude, if these \"estimates\" and money counting are how you usually deal with matters like that, I can easily see why Maddi doesn't want to cover your expenses, or why you can't scrape enough to cover them yourself. Seriously, put some thought into budgeting. How can you not know the rough estimate of how much a kid's birthday costs if you did the same last year?", "NTA. It's actually really worrying that Maddi won't do something nice for her stepdaughter. Her attitude sucks, frankly.\n\nYou set up a gofundme or something, I'd happily donate to that and I'm sure a lot other people would too.", "NAH. It seems you are both stretched to the max. with you paying for medical expenses and your wife paying almost all the essentials. It is not fair for you to ask her to take stuff away from your stepdaughter, to pay for a party for your daughter. Both girls, and your son, are deserving of nice things. I am so sorry, you are in this predicament, and I hope you find a way to make a nice birthday celebration for your daughter anyway. Please remember that it is not necessarily the money poured into an event that decides whether it becomes a good day or not.", "NTA that\u2019s her stepdaughter. I\u2019m shocked she hasn\u2019t offered to do more. I can\u2019t imagine having step children and the money to help and not wanting to. Plus she\u2019s sick. Like??? Are there other issues in this marriage/family? Can\u2019t imagine this is the one thing she\u2019s heartless about.", "NTA. Honestly, for something like this, only an AH wouldn't budge. I can't imagine saying you don't want to help a sick kid have a decent birthday just because \"wE pRoMiSeD tO kEeP FiNaNcEs sEpArAte\". Like, fuck, come to a deal on washing dishes or *something*", "I'm gonna say NTA here, but it seems like there are bigger problems in this family. Part of being a family is looking out for one another, and while I don't think Maddi is obligated to pay for Rachel's birthday, I do wonder why she doesn't *want* to. Talia is her child and it makes sense that Maddi would dote on her a little more, but its strange to me that Maddi wouldn't want to at least make sure Rachel has a nice birthday, especially when she sounds like she's not having a great time. Do you feel like maybe there's some resentment Maddi has from your children being a part of a previous relationship, or (and I mean this nicely) are you not being honest with how much of the cost of living Maddi is having to pay?", "NTA - this isn\u2019t a partnership. I\u2019d do this for a friend, let alone my husband and his sick child. I think her true colors are showing and they\u2019re ugly.", "YTA based on your responses. You can ask, but she is not a bad person for saying no and that is obviously what you want all if us to say. You want all of us to shame your wife into paying. She is already covering 80% of the bills - that\u2019s a lot. You don\u2019t appear to appreciate that at all.", "NTA\n\nHow much money are you looking for? Do you have any extended family around to help? Is bio mom in the picture? This seems like a situation where the entire family would want to rally around to help out. Maddi obviously is not planning on helping... which I think it\u2019s bizarre but that\u2019s her choice. You need to find other options.... And perhaps a better life partner\n\nETA based on the fact you used the word \u201cgreedy\u201d makes me believe there\u2019s more to this story.  No one would be considered \u201cgreedy\u201d for wanting to make their daughter\u2019s bday special", "NTA\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable for you to ask for financial help for your daughter's (potentially last) birthday. That being said, $1000+ is waaaaay too much to spend on a birthday party imo.\n\nYou could always try doing a fundraiser like a bottle drive to raise money as well!", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ll never understand this separate finance thing for married couples. It\u2019s icky. But the larger issue here is that your wife doesn\u2019t want to help you or your sick daughter. You should not even have had to ask. She\u2019s showing you the kind of person she is. Ball is in your court.\n\nHoping for the very best outcome for your daughter.", "YTA where is your childrens other biological parent!!! Your wife is already picking up where you are lacking when it comes to necessities.", "You\u2019re NTA, but I think your wife is. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how you can be married to someone, know their child is going to die, and not want to do a nice thing for the step child because ultimately you\u2019re not really doing it for the child, you\u2019re doing it to make your partner happy. And her partner is rightly miserable rn.\n\nHonestly this would make me question the relationship.

Isn't that what marriage is about? In sickness and in health? For richer or poorer? And even if we don't consider that, she makes 2.5x what OP makes. In plenty of relationships she would be paying more than half of the joint costs permanently to make things equitable. And if that doesn't change your mind, this is just temporary.

But in all honesty, I think this isn't a situation where internet validation will be very helpful to you. I think you're in a very difficult spot, and you have a partner who isn't helping you in a way that makes you feel safe and supported. This is the kind of situation that makes or breaks relationships. To that end, does it really matter if she's within her right to refuse help?\n\nI'd gently suggest that rather than trying to convince your wife to support you in a way that you need, focus on loving your daughter as much as possible and seek out support from people who are willing to support you in a way that feels right to you. Be with her. If she's as much a daddy's girl as you say, I can't imagine a better birthday than spending time with you.\n\nThe rest you can sort out in time.

That sounds illegal as fuck if they're lying to me", "That's not how it works? We have separate accounts, plus a dedicated essentials one that we pay into. But almost everything non essential is separate and on our own.", "I don\u2019t disagree but I can totally see feeling bitter & frustrated because it\u2019s his daughter & he wants to do something special. There\u2019s probably hundreds of ways he can get help but if he\u2019s spending all his time caring for his kid & working there\u2019s probably not a lot of extra time to be planning. He needs some help & seems like he can\u2019t help himself at the moment. He\u2019s definitely not an asshole for wanting to provide the best for his kid. Lots of parents would happily bury themselves in debt to give their child everything in this situation.", "Wife is already paying for 80% of all expenses.", "I haven't been in a financial state like this before. In previous years I usually set aside like a k or 2 and just brought what I thought would be good for the birthday. I never really added it up, though I never hit the limit before. I'm not good at that stuff so I tend to overestimate what I need so I definitely have enough.", "I have not said any numbers to her. Just asked for help\n\nAlso In the past I basically set aside a max and just brought what I felt necessary. I've never really added everything up or anything or birthdays, I haven't had to be so money counting for a long time.so I genuinely just don't really know exact numbers.", "Oh sorry I thought it was obvious from what I wrote.", "That's fine, i don't need combined finances. I just want help for this. She can give me a firm limit of how much she's willing and that's fine. I just want to be able to give her a normal birthday", "Because separate doesn't mean we don't talk? I know how much she earns and she doesn't have hidden debts to my knowledge.\n\nMy parents can't help, and I don't have other family. If Maddi won't help her family ain't an option. And my ex is passed away. She didn't leave basically anything financial.", "My point was that she can afford it. \n\nI have asked her to be more discrete about it around Rachel and Mitch, I know how guilty it makes Rachel feel. She blames herself enough for getting sick. But never told her to stop spending, or even want that.\n\nBut if she's happy to blow a thousand on (unnecessarily, extra) clothes and makeup over a random weekend, she can afford to help with a planned, known birthday.", "Informed? And how would I do that?\n\nShe didn't go around saying she doesn't love us. As far as I knew she did. Neither of us expected Rachel to be terminal. We didn't compemplate our child dying, at least beyond custody stuff.", "Okay, 2k is back to leaning in the wife's direction.", "Can you ask your parents for help? Or reach out to Make a Wish, do a Gofundme, or other fundraiser to help with expenses. Your wife is already paying more than the original agreement.  You're resentment is  building with her but she's doing more than she agreed to. I'm so sorry for what your daughter is going through.", "Really sorry to hear about your daughter being terminal", "Have you talked to make a wish? If Rachel is terminal that might be the best option.  And NTA for wanting some help but you might need to do something smaller.   My husband passed away and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how I would feel if one of my boys got sick.", "Wait? Where did 2K come from? Is this accurate, OP? What could possibly cost this much? I was leaning toward NTA, but if your asking for 2K, that\u2019s exorbitant for a birthday\ud83d\ude33", "NA for asking, but you have your answer so maybe you should consider how you can make a memorable, wonderful birthday for your daughter without have to spend your wife\u2019s money or money you do not have \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.  It is possible \u2026", "Does something like make a wish exist around you? They might be able to do something special for her?", "Nah the OP is a clown. He admits he just pays whatever bill shows up and hasn\u2019t checked into what his health plan actually covers because he \u201cisn\u2019t a lawyer.\u201d His wife is smart not to give him money.", "Ok except OP has admitted in the comments he hasn\u2019t looked at any of the bills or checked what his plan covers because he\u2019s \u201cnot a lawyer\u201d", "There\u2019s also a maximum out of pocket cost per year. It\u2019s higher then deductible and once you hit it (totals all co pays and such per year of covered costs), the health plan actually should pay 100% of all *covered* services. Very important note about covered and in network services. Maximum out of pocket (MOOP) is like deductible and has to be reached every year though to apply and is often pretty high, although some can be low most are not, think $10k-$20k. Every plan in US has MOOP", "Stop making assumptions. OP states he hasn\u2019t checked into what his policy covers. This is 100% his fault.", "Yes but if I\u2019m not mistaken his wife\u2019s income would count towards the financial income of the household which means they won\u2019t qualify. Source: same industry", "Dude, you don't need a lawyer, you literally need to pick up the phone, call the hospital's billing department and ask for a) itemized bill, b) a payment plan. Don't call the insurance, yeah, that's going to take you down the rabbit hole, call the hospital directly. Just start with the itemized bill. They can't refuse to send you an itemized bill.", "Your wife is paying 80% of the household expenses.  You can use your savings for this vlbirthday just as easily as you can for Christmas, and she doesn't owe it to uou to cover this birthday.\n\nNAH, fine for you to ask, fine for her to say she won't do it. But you don't get to blame your wife if it's \"just a Tuesday with cake\", it's not her responsibility to do that. Offer to pay her back if you don't want to pull from savings, instead of being mad she won't just give you the money.", "Nothing he said suggest she's dying. Just that she's sick. I would understand if this was the case. But he's already manipulating the info to paint his wife in a bad light. 2k is a lot for a birthday, and if his wife is already paying for 80% of all expenses, how much she actually has left after paying for her daughter expenses? And he has no family to help? Why is his wife being asked to shoulder even more? PS: American health system sucks. Edit: he's has savings. He just don't want to use it. Good to know.", "No, most likely it will not be the same. Yes, treatment bundles are a huge fat lie. Yes, it's illegal from the moral standpoint but legal from, well, legal standpoint. Ask Congress why. Welcome to the wonders of US healthcare system. And yes, asking for an itemized bill is the VERY FIRST advice that comes up if you google \"how can I afford my medical bill\". Dude, you are an adult, it's your responsibility to do some research when you are in a pinch, the majority of people can not afford a lawyer beyond Google and Reddit, and yet they do just fine.", "If you don\u2019t understand that your wife paying 80% of your bills means YOU DO NOT HAVE SEPARATE FINANCES all I can say is your wife is a lot smarter than you. Smart enough not to give you any more $$", "Absolutely, ultimately it's an awful situation all around.\n\nI would be doing the same for my kid but he needs to accept he can't afford these expensive plans and find an alternative way to celebrate. Not just moan that all she will get is a cake because he could do better than that even without more money if he put the smallest amount of thought into it.", "Well seeing as your financial obligations are tighter now perhaps you should be working on that.", "That\u2019s probably why she said no, she knows how much you\u2019ve spent previously, how you are woth money (really bad) \n\nYou assume she can afford it, but you don\u2019t see where her kkney goes, inflation gets worse by the month it seems, my 100$ a week grocery bill is nearly 400$", "If my partner paid 80% of my bills I wouldn\u2019t need combined finances either", "Would you offering to pay her back the money make her feel more comfortable giving it to you?", "When it\u2019s your own money you can decide what\u2019s an unnecessary purchase.", "With regards to sharing finances. I'm sorry about your kid.", "The only reason why I changed my judgement was that now he said he's daughter is terminal. The post is missing essential information. If a child is dying all bets are off. You try to make her last days as good as you possibly can right?", "I'm bad at numbers and guessing.\n\nIn the past my budgeting wasn't super precise. I basically just gave a rough guess, and rounded up. That way if I saved I'd definitely have enough. \n\nIt helped in terms of ensure I had enough to afford stuff. But looks bad in these terms.", "I will have to. But it's more that cheap/free stuff is ALL we've done. She hasn't experienced a proper restaurant dinner in months, aside from when her friends paid for her, and when my parents paid for us 3 months ago.", "IKR? I mean, small wonder his payments are through the roof, he didn't even bother to call the billing team, it appears.", "According to him, he hasn't even tried. He hasn't even asked them for an itemized bill.", "Ok I will. But what does that change, sorry if ignorant. \n\nWouldn't the bill be the same? How is it not illegal for them to lie about the costs I've had to pay? Like I'll do it but that shouldn't be necessary", "I am the OP. And I though I was clear but apparently not since two people mentioned it.\n\nShe's sick, and this is probably her final birthday. Its why I'm so desperate to do something normal, something meaningful. And not just cheap out like I have to for everything else. I know how guilty she feels when Mitch misses out on things.\n\nAnd the savings aren't reasonable to use. It's literally last ditch, emergency savings now. My entire pay is going to treatment or essentials. I can use some savings for certain events (e.g., Christmas) but not much. Or I'll have literally nothing if anything gets more expensive, or the car breaks down, or, god forbid, Mitch gets hurt", "Where do you get the 2k from?", "He definitely seems hyper focused on birthday but maybe it\u2019s just easier than looking at the bigger picture. Hope the dude finds some help. I don\u2019t think his wife is an ah either but I do understand she\u2019s the easiest person for him to blame. Hell... I think I would be pretty pissed off at the whole world if I were in his shoes.", "I understand, and have been a lot more tighter on it. I didn't do the math yet because I was asking if she'd be willing to help before planning something I can't afford. It may be her last birthday, I want it to be special.", "I'm not some leech. It's not like I'm profiting off this. I'm literally paying my entire paycheck to treatments and necessaities. And basically drained my savings with it.", "I would.\n\nThough as macabre and fucked up as it is, I won't be able to pay until after Rachel passes. I don't have a single cent going to saving", "Like is the daughter\u2019s doctor even in his network?? That could be the problem right there but we\u2019ll never know because it would involve \u2026doing some reading \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don't understand why savings can be used for Christmas but not Birthday?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is either worth it or it's not. Stop blaming your wife when you could pay for it if you wanted too.", "Add all that info to the original post. That completely change things up.", "He answered in a comment when he was asked how much he things the birthday dinner would cost.", "Too true!", "I hope you manage to put something together she will enjoy. Just remember spending time and love with your daughter will mean more than any material item you purchase for her.", "You\u2019re paying your whole paycheck because you\u2019re lazy. 1. Get social security for your kids no matter how small the amount 2. READ YOUR INSURANCE POLICY it likely covers more than you think 3. If your wife has better insurance put the kids on her insurance! You\u2019re married, that\u2019s all that\u2019s necessary for the kids to be covered by her policy 4. You need to stop being ignorant about money. Stop guessing what percentage of the bills your wife is covering. Is it actually 80%? Is it more??\n\nYou\u2019re not being 100% truthful in your post and you clearly have resentment toward your wife and her daughter. YTA.", "Because it's one or the other. Its already lower than it should. And a present each is cheaper than a birthday dinner and oresent. Like it wouldn't be a flash Christmas. Literally max 100 total. I don't have enough to dip further.", "I feel for the girl but this is ridicoulus.", "Maybe, but that's all she'd had recently. Like it'll just be another Tuesday but with cake. \n\nI want it to be a proper birthday. It's probably her last so I want her to finally have something special again, not to go without because she's sick and daddy can't afford it."]}
