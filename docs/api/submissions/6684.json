I do not like the way my sister treats Baby.\n\nIt started with small things, such as being a little rough changing Baby or lifting them. I don't know if it was intentional but I made a few comments when it happened, like, \"there's no need to be so heavy handed with Baby\" or \"you could be a bit gentler with Baby\" but nothing overly critical. When I confronted her about this she brushed me off but I would not let the issue go. I know this makes me sound insufferable but I was uncomfortable.\n\nIt escalated when one night she woke me up because she was shouting at Baby for crying. I took Baby to my room. Once they settled I went back to my sister and told her that that was not acceptable. I get that she's stressed but that didn't justify it. She didn't say anything so I left it at that.\n\nAfter this I found myself spending more time with Baby until I was eventually doing everything - changing, feeding, bathing, bed, etc. but I felt a growing resentment towards my sister as despite all the help she was getting her behaviour was the same. \n\nWhen I returned to work full-time, I paid for and organised childcare around my work hours so I could take Baby to and from daycare. One night I was working late I arrived home to find my sister right in Baby's face, screaming at them, calling Baby horrible names and cursing at them because they were refusing to eat (which I had explained was down to Baby being ill and teething). Baby was crying and next thing I knew my sister snatched their bowl and threw it onto the ground all while calling them a \"fucking spoiled brat\". My sister obviously wasn't expecting me because she just kind of froze when she saw me. I didn't say anything to her, just took Baby to my room and kept her with me until she fell asleep.\n\nThat night I confronted her about everything. She said that I have no say in how she raises her child. I told her that I did get a say in how this child was raised while they lived under my roof and that she wouldn't know anything about raising a child since I had been the one raising hers while she did nothing. She then started to cry and said that she was overwhelmed. I asked her how overwhelmed Baby must have felt while she screamed at them. I had no sympathy for her. I told her that I was ashamed of her and that she was a disgrace of a mother before I went to bed. \n\nWell, she must have told our family what I said and they've all decided to bombard me with angry texts. When I explained the situation to my friends they were split. Some argued that I was too harsh and that I don't know what it's like to be a single mom but one friend is a single mom and told me she had never treated her baby like that, nor did she know anyone else that did.

Are y\u2019all in a position to afford it? Honestly, she needs it, and Baby needs her to be in therapy or else something has to change drastically. Baby is being emotionally abused, and if her mother isn\u2019t willing to modify her own behavior, at some point her fitness to be a parent (or lack thereof) needs to enter into the equation. It\u2019s an unenviable position for you to be in, but if she can\u2019t or won\u2019t change, then at some point you and other people in the family need to start thinking about finding a way to terminate your sister\u2019s parental rights.

Also babies also tend to catch vibes so if your sister is relaxed then the baby might feel relaxed, maybe sit down with her and see if she can try and get an appointment with a doctor and if nothing changes then ask her if you can take over and be the sole parent to your niece.", "NTA.

I totally get being overwhelmed, but the right answer is to put baby down in a safe place and walk away until the rage subsides. NOT to scream at baby and throw things.

I would be somewhat inclined to agree with her because she's not showing many, if any, symptoms of it. She doesn't seem too depressed or in a low mood, she's very social (goes out 2-3 nights a week), she doesn't have any type of insomnia or low energy, etc. and she has bonded somewhat with the baby but it's almost like how you would bond with a friend's baby, if that makes sense? Whereas she saw Baby as getting in the way of her life, rather than being a part of it. I suppose that could in itself possibly be a symptom, that failure to bond properly, but I'm not sure.

I worked at an OB/GYN office for a few years, and you wouldn\u2019t believe the number of people who show up all happy and perky then spent the entire 30 minutes in the exam room crying about how the baby irritates them to no end and how they know they\u2019re supposed to love their baby but it just feels like someone else\u2019s baby. Then 30 minutes later, they\u2019re all happy and perky as they walk out. Their spouses had no clue cause they hid it so well.\n\nThe bottom line is, if she does not want to address the issue, rather it is PPD or just her not ready to be a mother, you can\u2019t help her.\n\nBut you can help her child, and I\u2019m glad you are.", "Postpartum rage is also a thing along with postpartum anxiety both of which sound a lot more likely.", "I'm not going to call anyone the AH here.

I can say from experience that weird shit can happen to your brain after a pregnancy, and it can last several years. Hormone changes can cause feelings you can't control, leading to poor behavior (again, not an excuse but a reason). I hope she'll accept some professional help, in the meantime, baby is very lucky to have such a caring uncle.", "NTA but can other family members help her emotionally and maybe financially?
