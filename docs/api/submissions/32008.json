She didn't want to travel and wanted to stay home and have my sisters \"Jane\" (F37) an \"Jill\" (F32) come to visit her. \n\nThe day after I left Jill disabled my upstairs security camera which sits on the bookshelf which she said she was feeling \"watched\".

Thanksgiving day we video called my son's mom (F37) to say happy thanksgiving and let her see the kids while they were away. She was riding in the car with her boyfriend (M42) and didn't mention where they were heading. \n2. The next day my sister disabled the other security camera in the basement which looks at the backdoor. At that point I checked the footage to see what was going on at the house. The audio captured included my ex-wife's voice and her boyfriend.\n3. I confronted my sisters and mom about it and all said that since I was away it was fine. My ex was over because they like her and I wasn't there anyway.\n4. I told them if they invited them back I would call the police and cause a scene, that they were not welcome in my house. My sister Jill told me they were coming back over and they already had plans. So I called my ex-wife directly and told her to not come over. Jill was very upset I ruined her plans.\n\nAfter things have settled, Jill was leaving to head home and started an argument that I ruined her vacation plans and left angrily. \n\nMy mom is taking Jill's side of the argument saying they did nothing wrong and it didn't harm me in any way.

I\u2019d also suggest a couple small external cameras the show all the entrances to your house.  Make them high enough up someone can\u2019t just reach up and yank the wire. \n\nIf your mother is living at your house as a guest/tenant then I believe you get to set the rules (check with a legal type person to confirm).  So the primary rule is your ex wife is not allowed in YOUR house.  No discussion.  \n\nIf your mother wants to chum with your ex not a problem - she and your sister(s) can go to the ex\u2019s house or meet where ever.

Even if your mother pays nothing to live in your house she likely still has rights based on being a tenant in that she\u2019s lived in your place for enough days.  \n\nSo if you decide your mother needs to move out (which I certainly would) and she refuses you likely have to hand her an eviction notice (again lawyer question) that says she received notice on X date and by law needs to be out by Y date.  I believe it also needs to state if all of her belongings aren\u2019t out by 1201am on Z date they can be moved to the curb.  The lawyer will know.  \n\nBest wishes working this out.

You are a kind soul to suggest a second chance but this situation is too much and I\u2019m confident that this isn\u2019t the first betrayal of this sort by the sisters and mom.  \n\nI strongly recommend showing mom the door immediately and cutting off contact with the sisters. People like this will always keep violating boundaries and then say that the OP is \u201cthin skinned\u201d or \u201cmaking a big deal out of nothing\u201d.  \n\nThey acted out and must face consequences.", "I mean, i suppose NTA, though kicking her out is a pretty big reaction with lots of repercussions...\n\nPersonally, I would go with the \"If this ever happens again, you'll have to find somewhere else to live because you won't be welcome here anymore. To be clear, I will kick you out if you violate my trust like this again.\"", "They were all in on it. Not just Jill", "I think you should just do it now, right when they did the offense. You wait until next year and they will do it again.", "Dude, they disabled your camera. Why do you want to talk through it ? They already shown you they won't", "They all knew you would be upset, thus the sneaking around and turning off the cameras. Don\u2019t let them gaslight you, it is your home and you don\u2019t want your ex in it. They can meet literally anywhere else.", "Massive security risk?

This is a little overboard.", ">\u201cYour house, your rules\u201d is a statement of the law\n\nit's also his mum's place so her rules as well", "I can't help being curious... why does your whole family like your ex so much and take her side against you?", "NTA. I would ban your ex and Jill from your house. If your mother doesn't like it, she can move to somewhere else and entertain whoever she wants.", "You know, this still doesn't explain that your mom knew not to invite her to your house while you were not present. She could have just thought you wouldn't want to attend anything Ex was attending, and didn't want Ex invited to anything you were going to.", "Because they were invited by someone who lived there\u2026\u2026.", "Just start the eviction now. \n\nYou're gonna be trudging through their bullshit for *years* to come. Might as well get it over with because this is absolutely going to be the easier route.", "Why did they have the authority to disable the cameras anyway?", "You\u2019re right, because they wouldn\u2019t have disabled the cameras if it was acceptable behavior.", "Sounds  to me that mom has already crossed that bridge, and set off dynamite.", "I bet mom babysits the kids, though.", "Oh please. This guy is no saint. He not only ditched his own kids on the holiday, he shipped them off to his new GF\u2019s parents\u2019 instead of letting them spend the holiday with his family or their mother. They have been divorced only for a year and he already putting his new chic ahead of his kids.", "Right? That was a giant middle finger to OP.  We know that this is a big no-no. But we want to see the ex so piss on you, your home, your GF, and your boundaries. The only logical consequence is to send her packing and change the locks when she's out.", "I had to make an outline and think about it for several months before I sat down with my mom to talk about a difficult situation. It helped me to determine what aspects needed to be addressed logically, not emotionally. We had a good conversation and the issues were resolved.", "She doesn't get another chance because she's already had two  - she's doubling down and siding with Jill and saying she can invite whoever she wants.  This is AFTER OP found out about all this.  She could have chosen to be a decent person and apologized and assured OP it would NEVER happen again - but she didn't do that did she? She needs to go live with Jill - now.", "I don't know about that. There are industries built around home security that many people don't care about most of the sensors only the cameras. Most only have them covering entrances but like to see who is coming and going.\n\nEdit: Ring is a prime example. Doorbell cameras are in millions of homes.", "Or else someone he doesn\u2019t like might be invited over. Horrors!", "It got me curious also...and i also got the feeling op is not on good terms with the ex, kids apart.\n\nBut, even if his divorce was only his fault, and if his family thinks the same, and love the ex and want her in their lives, they disrespected op and and acted like entitled people to his house.\n\nWant to meet op's ex wife ? do it somewhere else, they know they were acting wrong by op by desabling the cameras.\n\nNTA", "He's not TAH yet. He hasn't done kicked her out yet.", "sucks you're getting downvoted for pointing out that an adult woman should be allowed to invite anyone she wants to her house and if op's at 'i'll call the police' level he needs to clearly communicate that", "If he kicked her out for one mistake then yes YTA but doesn't seem hes doing that. \n\nBut inviting someones exwife and bf over to their home, common decency says theyd mention it to OP first", "Indeed, set up the obvious ones but have a secondary hidden one as the backup, for at least as long as OP's mom and sisters are engaging in this level of deception.", "How can he ever trust her again??? Disabling the cameras and lying, they literally plotted against him. This shows they all knew exactly what they were doing was wrong and did not care. OP is much kinder than I am. I would\u2019ve returned with boxes, packed her up and driven her and all her ahit to Jill\u2019s house \ud83d\udcaf I could never let anyone live in my home that behaved this way ever. Mom, husband, kid or Jesus GTFO immediately.", "I have to say this is an attractive option. But his Mom, retired, limited income - she's the one who jeopardized her living arrangements by being dishonest and wildly disrespectful, and likely was pushed into it by her other children - I'd go with \"one more chance\".  But \"Jill\" doesn't get to come over again for a very long time.", "It's a WebCam. You put something in front of it and it can't see anymore.", "Maybe the mom can because she lived there?", "Honestly Jill would be banned from my home for that. she knew what she was doing and tried to deceive him. The only thing I would be saying to the mother is that I own this property and if anything like this ever happens again she will be living with Jill. No discussion about anything it's this way or I will help you pack today. They all knew and tried to betray his trust and be sneaky. I would not tolerate that in my life, ever.", "Yeah but not having one is still not a \"massive security risk\" and almost certainly more common.", ">Just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should.\n\nThat applies MOSTLY to mom and Jill - just because they CAN have the ex over (since OP isn't there) certainly doesn't mean they should.\n\nOP - NTA. I'd kick mom out and change the locks. She went too far then doubled down when you called her on it.", "Have YOU ever wondered why she only gets to see the kids 10% of the time?", "Well then she can go live with one of the sisters.", "Then she can go live with the ex or your sisters that agreed to this whole thing. \n\nYou are not in the wrong here OP. It's up to you whether this is worth blowing up your relationships over, but I would.", "No, if you live in a house it is your home regardless of if you pay rent, pay the mortgage etc. This is law pretty much everywhere in the western world.", "Absolutely agree that this sub should be about 'aita' and not 'am I legally obligated' but IMO when every person in his family is still choosing to spend time with the ex AND when he is recording this mother in her home AND he thinks he can call the police on her having people she doesn't like in the house it makes me think there are missing missing reasons why everybody is siding with Jill and it makes me question how nice a guy OP is.", "This!!", "She can go live with Jill and invite the ex-wife over as much as they want at Jill\u2019s house.", "Not entirely sure how old your mom is, but if she is 65 and gets Medicare (and some places Medicaid will also help cover the cost) she can move to assisted living.  Try contacting A Place for Mom to find out what is available in your area.", "In my house I might not consider it a \"massive\" security risk but there are plenty of people out there that would. Consider people that have stalkers and abusive ex's.\n\nSure, while he's not home it's not as big of a life safety risk in real time but access to property is some times used for other purposes. \n\nThis is why you shouldn't open your door to strangers because they could be casing your house for the future. Things like motion detector placement and camera placement are more for an unknown intruder than a person who spends time in your home and can study it for multiple days. \n\nOnce again, this is more true when it's an ex and knows where the former partner usually keeps things like extra keys based on the previous relationship.\n\nI have 7 cameras. None of my cameras are inside or can hear my inside conversations but alexa hears everything anyway. My cameras are all local and don't have any cloud recording whatsoever.\n\nI consider my cameras being down a pretty major security risk with my children and their friends.

If he was just annoyed this would be a different story.", "Bullshit. \n\nIf she wasn't aware of this *technically* unwritten rule she wouldn't have jumped through hoops to try and disable the devices that would have let OP know what was happening. \n\nShe knew damn well OP didn't want his ex in his house and she violated his trust anyway, and went further and tried to make it a secret. She deserves to be kicked out for that alone, any second chance he gives her is purely magnanimous and out of love.", "I see your nuanced attempt to reason with OP and I'm here for it. You're right. OP isn't kicking out his mom because she invited his Ex over. I'm sure if mom had apologized after, there would be no threat of eviction. From what I'm seeing, OP wants to kick her out because she took his sister's side in the argument.\n\nAlso I don't see where OP's says she will keep inviting the Ex over. Rather, what she said about inviting whomever she pleases sounds more like justification of past behavior (re: Ex, specifically) instead of any indication she will do it in the future. And it doesn't seem like she will after OP blew up at her this time. And hopefully after he explicitly lays out that rule for the future. \n\nI'm not sure she can be lumped into the blame for disabling the cameras either. OP says his sister did that, and whether the mom was even aware they were disabled isn't stated. It could be that mom wasn't even aware Ex was going to be invited.", "I am an attorney.

Yet, even if that were true, that raises even more red flags about the whole situation. Courts don't just let a father keep the house, money, and 90% custody of the children for no reason. Something about her character or her actions has caused this, and I'm sure that's exactly why OP doesn't want/trust his ex in his house.\n\nShe has absolutely no right to be in his house without his knowledge and permission.", "You're right, it sounds like he has trauma related to his ex.
