Both kids live with me 90% of the time since I divorced last year. My mom (F67) also lives with me. She didn't want to travel and wanted to stay home and have my sisters \"Jane\" (F37) an \"Jill\" (F32) come to visit her. \n\nThe day after I left Jill disabled my upstairs security camera which sits on the bookshelf which she said she was feeling \"watched\".

Jill has never had a problem with the camera before.\n\nHere is the sequence of events:\n\n1. Thanksgiving day we video called my son's mom (F37) to say happy thanksgiving and let her see the kids while they were away. She was riding in the car with her boyfriend (M42) and didn't mention where they were heading. \n2. The next day my sister disabled the other security camera in the basement which looks at the backdoor. At that point I checked the footage to see what was going on at the house. The audio captured included my ex-wife's voice and her boyfriend.\n3. I confronted my sisters and mom about it and all said that since I was away it was fine. My ex was over because they like her and I wasn't there anyway.\n4. I told them if they invited them back I would call the police and cause a scene, that they were not welcome in my house. My sister Jill told me they were coming back over and they already had plans. So I called my ex-wife directly and told her to not come over. Jill was very upset I ruined her plans.\n\nAfter things have settled, Jill was leaving to head home and started an argument that I ruined her vacation plans and left angrily. \n\nMy mom is taking Jill's side of the argument saying they did nothing wrong and it didn't harm me in any way.
