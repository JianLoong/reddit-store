The only downside to the new place is my very next door neighbor. For context, my backyard and theirs are connected in that there is no gate and their backyard rests against my garage, my driveway is in front of the garage and my backyard grass area is right next to my driveway. My home is a corner house as well (So ample parking for me and the neighbors.) When I moved in, the neighbor husband informed me that he had an agreement with the owner of my home that he would be able to park in the garage/driveway in exchange for landscaping work. \n\nSome things about this bother me. 1. My house is owned by a company, not an individual. Perhaps years ago before he sold the house but not so much anymore. 2. Due to the legality of the property, I have to pay for renter's insurance for it which means if anything happens on the property, driveway or garage, I would be liable for it. 3. I have parked on this very street before and woke up to mystery hit and run damage, so Id really like to park in my driveway and has told the neighbors this. 4. The 'grass' in question doesn't take up more than 5' x 8' and 1' x 4'. 5. I have informed them of my intentions to park there and have kept my car away from the driveway to allow him to move his vehicle. I have gone as far as to share my plans to add a carport. Yesterday as I parked to get groceries in, I noticed he parked right back into my driveway. I asked him when he was moving his truck and equipment trailer and he asked when I was getting my carport. \ud83d\ude44 6. And this is the most important.

I have spoken to them a handful of times and when I began to move in 7 days ago, purposefully told them we would be moving in in 3 days so he had until then to move his stuff.
