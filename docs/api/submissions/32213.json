The look on your waiter's face is a natural reaction to having to live like this.\n\nSo, in a world where Black people are just allowed to live without harassment, it would be totally normal to compliment some dudes hair. Why wouldn't it be?\n\nBut we don't live in that world. In the world we live in, it is normal for white restaurant managers and customers to cause Black employees issues over that exact hairdo.\n\nYou didn't mean to be a jerk.

He just shrugs and says \"thanks\", but he'd rather people don't. It's a bit othering to only compliment the one lone black person on their hair in an otherwise completely white bar. Then there's also people who want to touch it.", "I think this laugh is the longest I've ever seen anyone fake laugh.", "Yeah just ignore all the historical context written out for you and go ahhahahaaha, really good response", "Like I said, OP. You can be the kind of person who cares if your actions are having the opposite impact from what you intended. \n\nOr you can be this guy \ud83d\udc46", "Okay so wasnt racsim but was instead racial discrimination\n\n\nSo if I, being a white guy was in a room of people consiting of multiple races, and I went around and gave everyone but the black people a compliment on thier physical appearance. That is not only okay, but actually the pollitcaly correct thing to do? That seems backwards.\n\nTIL white people are not allowed to complient people of other races because of the colour of our skin.", "I'm currently seeing a black girl and she would agree with me on what I said. Cry", "This thread is full of people who don't understand how microaggressions work.  This is like .03/10 offensive, but that wasn't the question, the question is was it offensive or not.", "I agree", "Hairstyle isn't just a choice, though. It also depends on genes, e.g. black hairstyles being different to white. I live in a very white country, where if you're black you're definitely standing out. A black friend of mine can hardly go out for drinks without at least one person complimenting him on his hair, and when I saw that happen he told me it gets tiring very fast. Sometimes people want to touch it, or stop him in the street to ask him about his hair. For me it's NAH, no assholes here. OP made a genuine compliment, but the receiver isn't obligated to appreciate it and might have reasons to assume it isn't a genuine compliment. Doesn't make the other guy an AH.", "Again, I agree that's the way it used to be and in my opinion should still be, I was just noting that getting the stink eye for that nowadays doesn't surprise me in the least. I'm sure most people are still on board with the \"compliments on choices are ok\" standard, but the number who will get offended anyway is steadily rising.", "Very true! I had someone say hi to me because in another country they saw me and then recognized me because of my hair. (It's blue and they had seen me walking around the same city).", "I think you're right in principle, my point was that the number of people who have those issues is increasing rapidly and the kind of reaction OP got is becoming more and more common. It shouldn't be that way, but the way it should be and the way it is aren't always the same.", "They said it was taboo to talk about Black people's hair. Not \"*you can't compliment another race anymore*\"", "If you\u2019ve had kids you\u2019d notice that pre school and kindergarten kids don\u2019t recognize color or ethnicity.  They just see another kid. If another kid is mean to them they don\u2019t think every kid that looks like them is bad.  Racism starts at home with the parents.  If the parents would pushing their hate on to their kids we\u2019d have a lot less racism.", "100%. White people don\u2019t understand how our hair is constantly a side show. Regardless of intention, it\u2019s very frustrating.", "The irony of you not realizing suggesting this is completely racist", "Thanks, bud! Context doesn't trump kindness or humanity. White people shouldn't compliment people of color with similar readiness and openness as those of their own race, 'learn, or YTA'. The end product of this type of behavior is segregation, you've gone so far left that you're leaning right.", "Agreed OP, you have a choice. Treat people of color as a simplistic, homogenous block of near-equals that need special treatment because of their color... like this guy. OR you treat them like a person. You take the wins as wins, and when a grumpy waiter doesn't like your compliment, you don't let it stifle your unfettered kindness.", "If a person was continuously bullied, and then got a compliment from someone, but assumed it was sarcastic/making fun of them, are they being \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d? It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\nFor starters, we don\u2019t know what went through the guys head. Maybe he had something else on his mind. But assuming it was a race thing, it\u2019s not discriminatory to assume the 1 compliment you got was mocking when the other 99 you got were mocking.\n\nAs a woman I\u2019ve been wary of compliments by men because I was worried it was going to go another way than just an innocent compliment. That\u2019s how humans work, we use our learned experiences to our benefit.\n\nAnd lol at thinking this counts as racial discrimination.", "\"i'm not Black but i date Black girls so i can't be racist!!1!\" please tell me who asked", "Idk, I am blonde, 5'2'', thin, curvy built. I am often noticed and complimented.  Should I now be offended if I am noticed for standing out or being different from the rest. Should I act rude to others if they are attempting to be kind or make a connection with me? If the dude got offended, it is because he has issues. I choose to presume  positive intentions from everyone.  If you live your life constantly butt hurt for preconceived negative notions, that's on them.", "Added the word 'hair' for semantics sake, then. But I was essentially doing what you are, changing the quote *ever* so slightly to point out its core absurdity.", "Lol that\u2019s certainly not true. Kids notice color and differences at that age and definitely call it out because of curiosity, but you\u2019re right\u2014 it\u2019s how the parents handle it that leads to racism.", "Lmao\n\nI am a black woman who was adopted by white parents as an infant.\n\nEverything you said is wrong.", "You are so either naive or willfully ignorant \ud83d\ude44", "Bingo.", "Indeed. By the same logic, it'd be demeaning for a white person to thank a black waiter because they used to be slaves and didn't get thanked.\n\nAbsolute lunacy all round. Treat people decent. Regardless.", "This! When a grumpy stranger doesn\u2019t appreciate a compliment, who jumps to RaCiSm? He\u2019s most likely just having a bad day, as we all do from time to time.\n\n\nThere are so many reasons he may not have welcomed the attention & frankly if we\u2019re going to assume, my vote goes to guys aren\u2019t always comfortable being complimented by other men, especially about their looks.\n\n\nIt\u2019s bizarre that OPs friend even made such an asinine claim & baffling to see so many people here validating such absolute nonsense.", "I was on about the \"tabbo to compliment on black peoples hair\" thing\n\nI didnt consider it being seen as coming across as sarcastic, my bad", "Plz tell me how I'm being racist? Cry", "Nobody is saying how you \"should\" feel. But your reaction to this is saying how this bartender should feel, and ignores the racial history around black hair and hair styles.\n\nI recommend that you do even a little bit of reading about issues around black hair and it's very very long history as a subject where racism rears it's head.", "They notice the differences of course but they don\u2019t associate anything bad about it.  Yet.", "What was wrong about the statement?  Did your parents say anything negative about another race or teach you to show respect to everyone equally?", "Really? Can you explain why?", "Misunderstandings happen, glad it could be cleared up.", "Weird hill to die on when you\u2019re the white person and black people are telling you how we feel and you\u2019re still saying it\u2019s incorrect. Consider that next time.", "\"black people are sensitive about their hair\" you're literally implying that every black person is the same? that's racism now go boohoo to your girlfriend bruh", "Yep that\u2019s what I said\u2026", "It was the early 70s. Yes, they were racist.

I will never compliment a black person on their appearance ever again. I now know that it is wrong.", "Lol \ud83e\udd23 you have no idea what racism is. Are you like 13? People like you is why no one can say anything about anyone or else it's \"ThAts RaCiSt\" go do some of ya homework."]}
