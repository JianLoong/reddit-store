The look on your waiter's face is a natural reaction to having to live like this.\n\nSo, in a world where Black people are just allowed to live without harassment, it would be totally normal to compliment some dudes hair. Why wouldn't it be?\n\nBut we don't live in that world. In the world we live in, it is normal for white restaurant managers and customers to cause Black employees issues over that exact hairdo.\n\nYou didn't mean to be a jerk.

It's that has often been a way to \"other\" them. If you know any black people well enough, ask them about their experiences with white people wanting to touch their hair - to feel the texture of it. It is an EXTREMELY common and often unwanted experience that is often accompanied by patronizing comments about how nice or cool their hair is. \n\nThis might be intended as a compliment on many occasions, but it still has the negative consequence of highlighting and drawing attention to difference in a way that can feel isolating for many people if colour.\n\nDon't just take my word for it. Actually go out of your way to listen to and understand the perspective of many people of color on this subject. Some will agree with your gut instinct. Don't limit yourself to those viewpoints that agree with you. Actuality listen to alternative perspectives on this.", "What load of crap!  Of course, babies are going to notice the difference in race. But they\u2019re not going to dislike the other person unless there is a reason to. They\u2019re going to associate more with what they know. If the first thing of white baby sees is a black mom and dad that baby is going to associate with the black mom and dad better than a white mom and dad that they show later.  If the first thing baby sees as a dog and later on, you show them a cat, they\u2019re going to react differently to the cat.  Noticing color and difference is not the same as being racist. The babies don\u2019t dislike the people because of their race they just noticed a difference.", "You don\u2019t have to be a scientist realize if a little black kid gets bullied by a little white kid, the little black kid is going to think the little white kid is a dick. But he\u2019s not going to think every white kid is a dick just because of the actions of one.  \nRacism is taught. And no bored ass scientist doing experiments on a six-month-old is going to convince me otherwise."]}
