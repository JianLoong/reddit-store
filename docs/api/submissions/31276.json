My downstairs neighbor and his girlfriend constantly decide to have loud sex usually between the hours of 1-3 in the morning. It's gotten so loud that basic moaning is loud enough to wake my boyfriend and I up. This happens at least 2-4 times a week. \n\nIt's almost 2 am and once again I hear my neighbors moaning so loud that I can hear them over my t.v, which is already set at volume 5 because mind you, it's early Sunday morning and I'm trying to be considerate. Frustrated, I decided to jump as hard as I could up and down my living room floor. A few seconds later someone responded back by pounding on their ceiling.\n\nI know I probably should of just contacted the landlord first or maybe talked to the tenant but it's become such a weekly annoyance and I feel super awkward having to approach someone much older than me about his sex life. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate the mix of opinions here! I will admit I really did feel like an ass immediately after I jumped but I think I should clarify that this hasn't been the first time I have had issues with this neighbor. Our apartment complex has multiple signs saying that smoking is not permitted within 25 feet of entrances and even has a special smoking area for this purpose. I have stopped opening my windows for a breeze because this neighbor and several of his friends repeatedly smoke on the front stoop and the cigarette smoke has traveled up into our apartment. They also like to hang out on said porch stoop on weeknights after 10 and are always loud to where I can hear them clearly with my windows closed. When they come inside his apartment they are even more obnoxiously loud and it's always late at night and after 10 pm. I complained once to the landlord about the smoking about a month ago and he stopped for a couple weeks but they've started back up again last week. The loud sex has been a constant and I was just so fed up that I reacted childishly and did the stomp.\n\nEDIT 2: To the (maybe?) deleted comment calling me a bitter woman: I'm bitter because I have terrible insomnia to where I have to wear earplugs from work and even with my earplugs in I can STILL hear them having sex! But I think I'm more upset that someone called out my terrible grammar so I guess I'm bitter and illiterate \ud83d\ude1e", "created_utc": 1700380676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ys4sv/aita_for_stomping_on_my_floor_because_i_could/", "score": 511, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will recommend any time you communicate with your landlord do it through email.  That way you have proof of what you complained about and their response. I had doing the \"he said, she said\" stuff. Take pictures before moving in and then  when I'm moved out. So they can't blame me for damage that was already there. Document everything.

Another part is being considerate of your neighbors and keep the noise down. There are times when noise is inevitable, and times when you don't mean to bother people.  Like using a blender. If either of you use a blender the other apartment can hear it. Should that stop you from having smoothies? No.  But the noise is absolutely a bother.  Should your neighbors have to stop having sex? Also no. \n\nI hated apartment living because I am incredibly nonconfrontational and would be bothered by these things but never address then with the neighbor.  Even in your situation, I would probably start vacuuming or something to try to \"teach them\" that the floors aren't soundproof and hope they'd recognize if they could hear me vacuuming I could DEFINITELY hear them.  I don't think it would hurt to address it with the landlord, you don't have to explain the nature of the sound, as that might make it embarrassing for everyone involved, but let them know you are woken by noise from the downstairs neighbor regularly and see if they have a soundproofing solution.", "I had an upstairs neighbor that did that CONSTANTLY.

It's a national initiative. \n\nThat doesn't mean anything in this context.  \n\nSo tell me where that resource is in rural communities?  It doesn't exist.\n\nYou need to learn what an anecdote is and that you have no authority here.  You saying that it's the case over and over again while failing to acknowledge that it *may* exist in larger urban areas that's not the entire country and you're being foolish if you think that applies universally.\n\nIf it did, it wouldn't need a national initiative, now would it...", "How would you know there's \"no evidence\" if you didn't do a \"deep dive?\"\n\n\nSomething doesn't add up.", "Oh shit.", "Because there's nothing in their small post history to suggest they hate the police, so how would you know they do?\n\nBecause the \"evidence\" is not there, so what does their post history being visible have to do with anything if it doesn't prove your point?\n\nTheir posts are talking about missing upvotes, a car, Iran conflict and help about a misdirected post. You still haven't answered the question.\n\nSo you're right, something doesn't add up. \n\nI think you're talking out your ass."]}
