My downstairs neighbor and his girlfriend constantly decide to have loud sex usually between the hours of 1-3 in the morning. It's gotten so loud that basic moaning is loud enough to wake my boyfriend and I up. This happens at least 2-4 times a week. \n\nIt's almost 2 am and once again I hear my neighbors moaning so loud that I can hear them over my t.v, which is already set at volume 5 because mind you, it's early Sunday morning and I'm trying to be considerate. Frustrated, I decided to jump as hard as I could up and down my living room floor. A few seconds later someone responded back by pounding on their ceiling.\n\nI know I probably should of just contacted the landlord first or maybe talked to the tenant but it's become such a weekly annoyance and I feel super awkward having to approach someone much older than me about his sex life. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate the mix of opinions here! I will admit I really did feel like an ass immediately after I jumped but I think I should clarify that this hasn't been the first time I have had issues with this neighbor. Our apartment complex has multiple signs saying that smoking is not permitted within 25 feet of entrances and even has a special smoking area for this purpose. I have stopped opening my windows for a breeze because this neighbor and several of his friends repeatedly smoke on the front stoop and the cigarette smoke has traveled up into our apartment. They also like to hang out on said porch stoop on weeknights after 10 and are always loud to where I can hear them clearly with my windows closed. When they come inside his apartment they are even more obnoxiously loud and it's always late at night and after 10 pm. I complained once to the landlord about the smoking about a month ago and he stopped for a couple weeks but they've started back up again last week. The loud sex has been a constant and I was just so fed up that I reacted childishly and did the stomp.\n\nEDIT 2: To the (maybe?) deleted comment calling me a bitter woman: I'm bitter because I have terrible insomnia to where I have to wear earplugs from work and even with my earplugs in I can STILL hear them having sex! But I think I'm more upset that someone called out my terrible grammar so I guess I'm bitter and illiterate \ud83d\ude1e", "created_utc": 1700380676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ys4sv/aita_for_stomping_on_my_floor_because_i_could/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t be subtle, embarrass them in your conversation, tell them exactly how loud it is, at what times they\u2019re doing it and other relevant details like that.

On the one hand I believe in being respectful of noise and my surroundings but I understand with apartments this isn't always achievable. On the other hand the sound of people having sex makes my skin crawl and would be an extremely awkward conversation. That being said your frustration is valid but I think it's always a better choice to try to do these things face to face. In my experience, approaching the subject with sincerity and respect usually opens a channel for productive dialogue. A little humor might also cut that tension. But I definitely understand your frustration 1000%.", " NTA but yeah, the better solution would have been to talk to the people involved with words ..     \nThey\u2019re assholes themselves though, I mean, they know a 100% the reason why you stomped on your floor and they should just have been a little more quiet after that.", "NTA.  Frustration at the insensitivity of others can sometimes lead to an emotional response.  Chill.  Forgive yourself for being normal and let the landlord handle the problem.  If necessary, inform the police.   Neighbor needs to be educated.  Be happy.", "I probably would have slipped a note under their door and asked them to calm it down, but at the end of the day you have a right to the quiet enjoyment of your home- and I can certainly understand your frustration at the noise level.

Don\u2019t say it\u2019s sex noises, say you don\u2019t know what the noises are but it happens consistently 2-4 times every week.

Here, it is the norm that people call the polices to report any excessive noises during quiet times.", "NTA. It\u2019s reasonable to knock on a wall or hit a floor or ceiling when neighbors are loud, especially at night. That said, the better way to handle it would have been to tell them directly after it became a pattern. Because of the nature of the sounds, I think it\u2019s also okay to leave a note. \u201cI can hear your nighttime activities when they get loud, which is every night for several hours. It wakes me up. Please keep it down.\u201d Then, if it keeps happening, you would report it to the landlord. If they still don\u2019t stop, I would call the police. If it\u2019s really that loud, then it\u2019s a noise disturbance even if it is just sex.  I had neighbors once who screamed so loudly during sex that a pizza place down the block called the cops on them.", "NTA, this happened with my next door neighbor, I wrote a note and slid it under their door requesting them to keep noises low.", "NTA. If you had asked them to be quiet several times before and they\u2019ve ignored your requests, then I totally understand", "NTA, best to talk it over or maybe write a letter expressing your concerns.", "I get why you did it. Loud neighbors suck. I wouldn't say you are an asshole. I do think jumping as hard as you can was a bit excessive. But again I get it. You need to get up early and it's super late so you are frustrated. I'd definitely talk to your landlord about it. Next time just 2 knocks on the floor. \n\nI had really bad downstairs neighbors. They were always arguing or partying. I got sick of going down there and asking them to keep it down. So I took my 3 ft tall speakers and played them on the floor facing down. When they got loud so did I. After a while I noticed they haven't been loud for a week straight. I only did this after I talked to the landlord several times and nothing was being done.  I will recommend any time you communicate with your landlord do it through email.  That way you have proof of what you complained about and their response. I had doing the \"he said, she said\" stuff. Take pictures before moving in and then  when I'm moved out. So they can't blame me for damage that was already there. Document everything. Good luck with your loud sex neighbors. If you do point speakers down to the floor it would be funny playing some crazy porn hub video.

If life gives you lemons make lemonade?", "NTA.. My neighbours are exactly like this and the amount of times I have wanted to bang on the wall or scream because at the sheer disrespect and inconsideration they have for the neighbours really grinds my gears.

My neighbors do the same thing. My bedroom shares a wall with theirs. Sometimes they go at it so hard that MY BED starts shaking.

I'm leaning towards NAH, or maybe Everyone sucks...\n\nPart of apartment living is dealing with noise pollution from your neighbors. Another part is being considerate of your neighbors and keep the noise down. There are times when noise is inevitable, and times when you don't mean to bother people.  Like using a blender. If either of you use a blender the other apartment can hear it. Should that stop you from having smoothies? No.  But the noise is absolutely a bother.  Should your neighbors have to stop having sex? Also no. \n\nI hated apartment living because I am incredibly nonconfrontational and would be bothered by these things but never address then with the neighbor.  Even in your situation, I would probably start vacuuming or something to try to \"teach them\" that the floors aren't soundproof and hope they'd recognize if they could hear me vacuuming I could DEFINITELY hear them.  I don't think it would hurt to address it with the landlord, you don't have to explain the nature of the sound, as that might make it embarrassing for everyone involved, but let them know you are woken by noise from the downstairs neighbor regularly and see if they have a soundproofing solution.", "I had an upstairs neighbor that did that CONSTANTLY.
