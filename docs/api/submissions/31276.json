{"id": 31276, "submission_id": "17ys4sv", "title": "AITA for stomping on my floor because I could hear my neighbors having sex?", "selftext": "I(26F) live on the top floor on an three story apartment complex. My downstairs neighbor and his girlfriend constantly decide to have loud sex usually between the hours of 1-3 in the morning. It's gotten so loud that basic moaning is loud enough to wake my boyfriend and I up. This happens at least 2-4 times a week. \n\nIt's almost 2 am and once again I hear my neighbors moaning so loud that I can hear them over my t.v, which is already set at volume 5 because mind you, it's early Sunday morning and I'm trying to be considerate. Frustrated, I decided to jump as hard as I could up and down my living room floor. A few seconds later someone responded back by pounding on their ceiling.\n\nI know I probably should of just contacted the landlord first or maybe talked to the tenant but it's become such a weekly annoyance and I feel super awkward having to approach someone much older than me about his sex life. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate the mix of opinions here! I will admit I really did feel like an ass immediately after I jumped but I think I should clarify that this hasn't been the first time I have had issues with this neighbor. Our apartment complex has multiple signs saying that smoking is not permitted within 25 feet of entrances and even has a special smoking area for this purpose. I have stopped opening my windows for a breeze because this neighbor and several of his friends repeatedly smoke on the front stoop and the cigarette smoke has traveled up into our apartment. They also like to hang out on said porch stoop on weeknights after 10 and are always loud to where I can hear them clearly with my windows closed. When they come inside his apartment they are even more obnoxiously loud and it's always late at night and after 10 pm. I complained once to the landlord about the smoking about a month ago and he stopped for a couple weeks but they've started back up again last week. The loud sex has been a constant and I was just so fed up that I reacted childishly and did the stomp.\n\nEDIT 2: To the (maybe?) deleted comment calling me a bitter woman: I'm bitter because I have terrible insomnia to where I have to wear earplugs from work and even with my earplugs in I can STILL hear them having sex! But I think I'm more upset that someone called out my terrible grammar so I guess I'm bitter and illiterate \ud83d\ude1e\n\nEDIT 3: To the comments saying I'm just a jealous female who isn't \"getting any\" you're absolutely right: I'm jealous I'm not getting any decent sleep. And why move into an apartment if I \"can't handle noise\" or just \"move out and get a house\"?  Was I just supposed to just move out my parents house, sit in a box on the street and ask for spare change? I made a poor emotional decision but come on y'all. \n\n\nEDIT 4: Posted in the comments but should of just put here. I took most of everyone's advice and I talked to my neighbor just now. I apologized for my stupid reaction and he couldn't have been nicer about the whole thing. \n\nTurns out he was as equally embarrassed that I could hear his sweet love-making\ud83e\udd23\nThank you to everyone for giving me the courage to GROW THE FUCK UP! \n\nOh and to the tough guy who sent me a private message about being a fat, jealous female: Don't ever hate on Pokemon!

They were always arguing or partying. I got sick of going down there and asking them to keep it down. So I took my 3 ft tall speakers and played them on the floor facing down. When they got loud so did I. After a while I noticed they haven't been loud for a week straight. I only did this after I talked to the landlord several times and nothing was being done.  I will recommend any time you communicate with your landlord do it through email.  That way you have proof of what you complained about and their response. I had doing the \"he said, she said\" stuff. Take pictures before moving in and then  when I'm moved out. So they can't blame me for damage that was already there. Document everything.

I'm leaning towards NAH, or maybe Everyone sucks...\n\nPart of apartment living is dealing with noise pollution from your neighbors. Another part is being considerate of your neighbors and keep the noise down. There are times when noise is inevitable, and times when you don't mean to bother people.  Like using a blender. If either of you use a blender the other apartment can hear it. Should that stop you from having smoothies? No.  But the noise is absolutely a bother.  Should your neighbors have to stop having sex? Also no. \n\nI hated apartment living because I am incredibly nonconfrontational and would be bothered by these things but never address then with the neighbor.  Even in your situation, I would probably start vacuuming or something to try to \"teach them\" that the floors aren't soundproof and hope they'd recognize if they could hear me vacuuming I could DEFINITELY hear them.  I don't think it would hurt to address it with the landlord, you don't have to explain the nature of the sound, as that might make it embarrassing for everyone involved, but let them know you are woken by noise from the downstairs neighbor regularly and see if they have a soundproofing solution.", "I had an upstairs neighbor that did that CONSTANTLY.
