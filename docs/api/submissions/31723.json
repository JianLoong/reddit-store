My gf [21] is pregnant and I know she hasn\u2019t been loyal with me to which I ended things. But she came up pregnant, the thing is. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my baby or not. The time lines from when she got pregnant was when she was cheating on me but there is also a chance that the baby is mine. I don\u2019t know what to do. I want to kick her to the curb so bad, if it wasn\u2019t for the possibility of it being my baby, she would\u2019ve been gone. I want to get a prenatal test but they\u2019re too expensive for me to afford. Everytime she talks about the baby she says \u201cmy baby\u201d instead of \u201cour baby\u201d and anytime I bring it up she just laughs it off and ignores it which is a huge red flag to me. Why would it be so hard to just say \u201cyes it is our, I\u2019m sorry\u201d. She also said that quote \u201cif my baby comes out and I don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll just give it to someone\u201d to which I said \u201cno, that is my baby too and I will do everything in my power to make sure it is taken care of by me\u201d. The relationship has been failing ever since she cheated (as anyone can imagine). The only reason I even talk to her is because of the possibility it\u2019s mine but I am not going to let a woman who\u2019s pregnant with someone else\u2019s kid just sit at my house all day and relax and do nothing, that would be my responsibility if it was garunteed mine.

So yes, kick her out. NTA", "You need a family court lawyer. Do not sign the birth certificate. And absolutely, kick her out. NTA if DNA comes back as yours, start by filing for full custody.

Start talking to a lawyer ASAP so you have a plan either way.", "She shouldn\u2019t have been allowed back into your home after cheating.

She gave birth and he wanted the child...she did not.\nHe didn't even get to hold that child before it was taken for adoption. Another scenario is even if you are the father that does not mean you have the right to visitation but can be financially responsible. \nAlso have seen men be financially responsible even if the child isn't yours. \nCHECK YOUR STATE LAWS.\nGet her out of the house before birth and do paternity after. \nBuckle up!", "YTA.\n\nHave you heard of paragraphs?", "Honestly everyone is giving you really shitty advice. You had sex with this woman and it\u2019s possible that that child is yours. Sit her down, have a convo with her and tell her how you\u2019re feeling and what you want to do once you know. \n\nIf I was in the soon to be child\u2019s situation and found out my dad kicked my mom out while SHE was pregnant with me, cheater or not, I wouldn\u2019t respect him. While it takes 2 to get pregnant, only one is actually pushing it out and protecting it. I don\u2019t support cheating at ALLLL, but I respect kicking her out even less. I think a lot of the younger generations (z and alpha) would. \n\nAllowing her to stay with you until the paternity is determined is the most humane thing to do; living is expensive and moving is hard while pregnant. \n\nIn reality no one owes anyone anything, so it\u2019s now on you to determine what you owe yourself and the humanity you\u2019re willing to extend to a person you decided to have sex with and a baby, yours or not. \n\nI agree with what everyone else is saying once you determine paternity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if kid is yours you don\u2019t have to stay with her.", "Question here is why is the burden completely on your shoulders? Have you considered involving her parents or friends? I\u2019m sure you have fears of kicking her out and later finding that she forfeited the child at the hospital to the state before even being able to run any tests.  Consult an attorney to have documentation that allows you rights to perform tests in the event that she leaves you/ or you kick her out and later find that the child is no longer with her. If money is a problem, look into legal clinics nearby. At this point you have no rights whatsoever to prove your rights to request a paternal test.", "You probably won\u2019t listen but the baby regardless if it\u2019s yours won\u2019t fix anything and you should remove yourself and save yourself a bunch of money and stress. This time would be best used stacking your money. Child support isn\u2019t really that big of a deal man if it\u2019s just one kid. And you\u2019ll probably end up feeling like a single father anyway if you stay with her. Get out now go to appointments if she doesn\u2019t make it impossible for you not for her. Be there when the baby is born if you can. Be prepared for if you not with her that moment getting weaponized against you. Stand your ground. That experience you want you won\u2019t get with her regardless. Easier said than done I\u2019m still with my ratchet ass bm for my son. Every time I create a big financial come up for myself through my business I blow it on the relationship n I should just set me and my son up. Don\u2019t be me. Don\u2019t wait years.

I\u2019m sure she has family that would help until you can determine paternity. Secondly, she\u2019s willing to give the baby up for adoption just because she may not like it???? I wouldn\u2019t want a woman with an attitude like that anyway!! And on top of it all she appears to be rubbing it in your face and using the pregnancy as an excuse to just lay around, eat bon bons and complain about swollen feet or any other pregnancy symptoms she may have. If this baby is yours, I hope you are able to fight for custody or help her put the baby up for adoption. She doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019d be a very good mother. Good luck!!", "What about the guy she cheated on you with? Does he know that she\u2019s pregnant and possibly could be his? You definitely need a paternity test cause one of you will have to step up to take care of that child.. but as far as your relationship with her, father or not she cheated and if that\u2019s not something you can get past then end things with her.", "This is all such white trash behavior.", "Exactly this.  NTA.  Whether or not the child is yours, the true issue is that your gf cheated on you.  And obviously has no remorse.  Kick her out now.
