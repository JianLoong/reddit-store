A gift should always be motivated by wanting to show someone that you appreciate them and/or have affection for them.  If your motive in giving a gift is pure, you do not expect a gift in return.  So the concept of \"gift lists\" is rather rude, actually.  I can understand how a Christmas list might be helpful, but only in a very odd circumstance.  That is, you want to show appreciation or affection for someone who you don't know very well, so you honestly have NO idea what to give that person.  In that case, you could use the Christmas wish list as a general guide.  But how would you be motivated to give a gift to someone and yet you don't know them at all?  That's kind of a contradiction.  Unless you are in a \"random act of kindness\" type of mood.  Like giving the over-worked waitress at the diner a $500 tip, for your burger special order...\n\nIn that case, your motive is pure (just a random act of kindness) but OF COURSE you don't know the person at all. \n\nFor your boyfriend to try to steer your gift giving and then get upset about it when you balk?

That is nuts.\n\n   I came from a home where \"Live *below* your means\" was just the way to do things.

That means, are you keeping your money separate, what does this mean for gifts. Are you planning on having a joint account for expenses when you live together, by joint I mean an account you both put money into not merging everything. \n\nSo for instance in this case, you'd be saying it's your money to spend on gifts. You're allowed to buy your parents gifts if it's financially feasible with your money, it's a choice you make. His sister is not your family, you've made the choice not to buy her those gifts because she is his sister and therefore it's his responsibility to buy her gifts. \n\nHowever if he wants to go 50/50 he's more than welcome to give you half the money you paid for your parents gift and half the money for his sisters and then you can chip in.
