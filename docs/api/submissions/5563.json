If you\u2019ve seen it, the comforter alone is around 350. I told my boyfriend I\u2019d get the makeup set she was asking for and the lulu lemon leggings. He asked about the comforter. I said I love her, but I\u2019m not spending that kind of money on anyone but my parents. He immediately got upset and said that my current job pays me enough to afford it. I told him yes that was true but I\u2019m not going to spend the money anyway because I\u2019m saving buy a condo in the near future plus I have a trip to Spain coming up. He got upset and said I was being greedy and only thinking of \u201cme me me\u201d. That was last week.

A gift should always be motivated by wanting to show someone that you appreciate them and/or have affection for them.  If your motive in giving a gift is pure, you do not expect a gift in return.  So the concept of \"gift lists\" is rather rude, actually.  I can understand how a Christmas list might be helpful, but only in a very odd circumstance.  That is, you want to show appreciation or affection for someone who you don't know very well, so you honestly have NO idea what to give that person.  In that case, you could use the Christmas wish list as a general guide.  But how would you be motivated to give a gift to someone and yet you don't know them at all?  That's kind of a contradiction.  Unless you are in a \"random act of kindness\" type of mood.  Like giving the over-worked waitress at the diner a $500 tip, for your burger special order...\n\nIn that case, your motive is pure (just a random act of kindness) but OF COURSE you don't know the person at all. \n\nFor your boyfriend to try to steer your gift giving and then get upset about it when you balk?  That's really low.  Like, what kind of upbringing did he have where he feels THAT entitled?", "NTA and you should probably ask him if he\u2019s already made some promises that he intended you to keep.", " Unfortunately, many people assume that when you are making more than them, or earn more than the average bear\\~it means extravagant spending. Both your bf and his sister think b/c you earn a \"good living,\" you should be fine with buying a $350 comforter!!  That is nuts.\n\n   I came from a home where \"Live *below* your means\" was just the way to do things. Yes, there are things I splurge on, but gifts are generally not one of them...and for an *almost SIL?* No way. Heck, those leggings are probably over $100! \n\nHonestly, I think they are both looking at you as the Cash Cow. You make way more than them=you should buy expensive gifts.", "NTA\n\nGiven what you have told about the financial part of pay for the gifts.\n\nYou're not Santa Claus.\n\nYou don't have to spend more on a gift than you want.\n\nIf bf wants to give his sister an expensive gift, he needs to open up his wallet and pay for it with his own money.", "NTA.

That means, are you keeping your money separate, what does this mean for gifts. Are you planning on having a joint account for expenses when you live together, by joint I mean an account you both put money into not merging everything. \n\nSo for instance in this case, you'd be saying it's your money to spend on gifts. You're allowed to buy your parents gifts if it's financially feasible with your money, it's a choice you make. His sister is not your family, you've made the choice not to buy her those gifts because she is his sister and therefore it's his responsibility to buy her gifts. \n\nHowever if he wants to go 50/50 he's more than welcome to give you half the money you paid for your parents gift and half the money for his sisters and then you can chip in. If that's something you both think you want to do moving forward. \n\nI think those conversations will make him realise it's ridiculous for his sister to expect a duvet worth that much, especially if she knows he can't afford it.", "NTA her relatives can buy her the UGG bedding.
