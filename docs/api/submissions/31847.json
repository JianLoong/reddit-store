She has 2 kids (17F and 12M) from a previous relationship.\n\nLong story short, her ex up and disappeared one day, she struggled with the kids, we met when they were 11 and 6, got married 2 years later, and by then they were already calling me dad.\n\nI am a wealthy man, and I did my best by them, and God knows I loved them like my own kids, I even wanted to adopt them, and that's when things went downhill.\n\nWe needed their father to sign off on the adoption, but he figured that I had money, so instead of doing so, he fought for custody. Thankfully he only got visitations, then later one week a month.\n\nThis whole thing started last year, when SD used an emergency credit card we gave her, to buy coffee. When we asked her where her -very generous- allowance was, she ended up admitting that she gave it to her dad, since he needed help.\n\nWe grounded her for using the CC for non emergencies, but decided that she is free to do whatever with her allowance, even though we didn't agree with it.\n\nA month later, she wanted an increase in allowance but we said no, she stopped talking to me, and told her mom that I am a vindictive AH for how I was treating her dad.\n\nA couple weeks later, we were surprised by a CPS visit, with cops. Apparently SD \"confided\" in a teacher that I was abusive. Long story short, it was a plan her dumbass dad came up with to extort money from me, but my stepson came foreward, and after a short investigation I was cleared. This was late May.\n\nIt was then I kicked SD out of my house (and it is mine, not a marital asset), took away the car I got her, cut her off financially and pulled her out of private school. When my wife tried to tell me no, I told her she was free to spend her money on her daughter, but since I was not related to her, nor was I responsible for her, she could go live with her dad for all I care. I was not going to risk further accusations.\n\nThings died out over the summer, SD tried to apologize but I refuse contact with her. Now I am taking my wife and SS to Paris for Christmas, and she is back to begging for forgiveness. I still refuse to have anything to do with her. My wife says I am an AH for how I am treating her daughter. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: since some people implied it **my SD is living with her dad in a safe part of town, he is gainfully employed, and she goes to public school. It's not like she's living on the streets and dropped out of school**\n\nEDIT 2: She still meets her mom and brother, spends time with them, visits as long as I am not in the house (which is often), her mom still provides for her financially.... Also, I think 16 is plenty old enough to know wrong from right, and to know that accusing someone of abuse, is extremely wrong.", "created_utc": 1701098857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1855iub/aita_for_cutting_offkicking_out_my_stepdaughter/", "score": 1759, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bro, going to be blunt here, the wife don't give a fuck about you. You were nothing more than an ATM for her and her kids. She's willing to ignore the fact that you got accused of sexually assaulting her daughter and thinks that no big deal \"kids will be kids\" type of thing. That shit has devastating effects on you and your life. The fact that she thinks this is no big deal...I would seriously be considering who else might have been in on the plot. Sure it might have been the father and daughter conspiring together, but the fact that your wife sees this as no big deal probably means that she knew and encouraged it, or that she knew and just didn't bother taking action. I'm sorry, but I can't shake the fact that your wife is just letting this slide like it's nothing. If your wife cared about you as a person, she would have been all over the daughter for the accusation and would have immediately told her to go to her father's house; whether that be for her own \"safety\" or because she didn't believe her. Something is not adding up here and honestly you should be looking into getting your estate, assets, and whatever in order in case shit goes down. Normally, I don't immediately encourage divorces as people are complex beings with complex dynamics between each other, and complex situations; but bro you need to dump her ass ASAP. Something smells fishy here, and it ain't the fish market. \n\nYou are not the asshole here and you really need to start looking at what is going on around you. Couples therapy is not going to help in this case if your wife just doesn't see how devastating that is to be accused of. Bro, you could have lost the very plush life you have and then what? Who would they blame for it? I can tell you right now if their little plan had of worked, and you lost the sweet life you got, she would have immediately divorced your ass and took whatever you had left. Again, something is not right here and she needs to go, nothing good is going to come of this. You can do all the therapy you want, but there is something deeper going on here, and honestly, I feel the stepson is caught in the middle. \n\nDO NOT let this girl into your house to visit NO ONE! They want to see her, they can go to McDonald's or Burger King; they can go to the park for all I care. So long as it's not in your house where they can do some serious shit like plant evidence or whatever. Take your name off her emergency contacts for everything, take her name off of any credit card usage things, take her name off of everything, because anything could be used as evidence against you with people like that. If you ever have to be anywhere near her, record that shit. State at the beginning of the recording, the date and time, and state that you are recording this as evidence. if you are a two party consent area, in the recording, ask if she consents. If she states no on recording, then state: I will stop recording, but I refuse to meet and speak with you farther. Cut the recording and just walk away. Say nothing else, get in the car and leave. If you have to meet with her, do it in public places and NEVER do so at your house or somewhere private. I honestly doubt this girl is remorseful for what she did, because if she had any shred of decency then she wouldn't have accused you of sexual assault in the first place. She's old enough to know what that can do to a person and how detrimental to their life it can be. She knows it, so don't let your wife try to tell you she didn't know any better. \n\nAll in all, get your estate, assets, everything in order, lawyer up, hopefully you signed a prenup, and honestly, get some divorce papers ready because there is something seriously up with all this shit and I don't like it.", "NTA.

Is her mother looking out for that?) \n\nThe reality is that given that your wife and stepson continue being part of her life (and that's a GOOD THING) it *will* raise the question whether she can repair the harm done and what it would take to maybe not be forgiven, but achieve a civil relationship again. This will be a path that your wife and stepson wish to happen. It's very hard to live with someone bent on eternal vengeance *-* not that this is your case, but they'll want to know where you are on the continuum from that to forgive-and-forget. Going from a status of beloved daughter to non-entity is a formidable tumble. For you the question is raised how you deal with people who have wronged and victimized you. In your particular case, flavored by the fact that you're in a pretty powerful position regarding people perpetrating the harm. I don't have a 100% spot-on  recommendation to you, but Danya Ruttenberg's \"On repentance and repair\" has a lot of good material on what it takes to repair harm. Though it should be your stepdaughter who is exploring these themes, they may be clarifying your thinking too.  Are you getting therapy to be able to talk through all those things?", "NTA - however, this is a child that you loved and wanted to adopt. It is clear that her father was a very poor influence on her and she was a child, looking for his love.  Therefore kicking her out of your life forever without attempting to reconcile is a bit much.  I would offer to meet with her and a counselor/therapist who can help moderate the conversation.  When you reach out, explain that she has caused great harm, and in order for you to have a relationship she needs to take ownership for all the harm that she caused as well as what could have happened had she been believed.  I would also advise her that it may take many difficult conversations to achieve reconciliation and if she isn't willing to do deep self-reflection and the work to reconcile, then no need to bother.\n\nSome of the questions I would ask:\n\n1) As part of the guided conversation, I would ask if she has apologized to the Teacher, CPS and the Cops?  Does she understand why they need an apology and what should go into the apology.\n\n2) What was her end goal in making up this story?  You need to hear it from her and she needs to say it out loud. \n\n3) I would ask what would have happened had she been believed?  Was the goal for you to be sent to prison and forever listed on the child sex offender registry?  What would life be like in prison?  What happens to people on the child sex offender registry?  \n\n4) Why does she want to be forgiven (i.e. does she really miss you or just the $$$ and privilege).\n\n5) Does she understand that you two can never be alone together?  Why can't you be alone with her?\n\n6) How does she see a future relationship with you?\n\nI would do a lot of listening, let there be awkward silences.  She needs to think and reflect on her behavior. Avoid mentioning her father and his influence on her, they have a complicated relationship and you gain nothing by putting him down.\n\nRemember, you loved her like your own.

Having her live with her dad seems warranted given the CPS circumstances.

Have you had an honest conversation about how her father is with you and your money (not sure how a CPS case would be a situation to extort money though)? You say she's old enough to know right from wrong, so she's old enough to know the truth about some circumstances. Don't think she's entitled to a Paris trip, but if you truly 'love her like your own' I can't see how you can refuse her apologies or even be in her presence if your wife/son are around. Accepting an apology doesn't mean forgetting the situation obviously, but you're letting her be around someone 24/7 now with bad moral values rather than attempting to instill any more good ones... She's got a year left (potentially less) on child support claims if it ends at 18 (admittedly I don't know much about that), has dad tried for that yet?? If so or if not, either way you'd basically be giving into his claims for your money by having her live with him. But again, don't blame you for wanting that route.

However, she is 16. Her brain is not fully developed yet and she was trying to earn/gain love and affection from someone who had previously abandoned her. My guess is, she felt like if she didn\u2019t do this, then her father would not love her and would abandon her again. Often times in divorce, children will work harder for love and affection from the parent that\u2019s love is conditional, even at the expense of the other parent, because they believe the other parent will love them no matter what. She called you dad previously because she loved you, not because you have money. In my professional opinion (I\u2019m a psychologist), I would recommend attempting to reconcile. If not, you are no better than her father who abandoned her when she was younger. I\u2019m not saying take her to Paris or give her money. I\u2019m saying to attempt to have a relationship again, and family therapy would be a good place to start that work. The hurt you and you are justified to feel angry and hurt and all those other feelings. But the reality is you are an adult and she is still a child (remember, the frontal lobe which is responsible for decision making, is not fully developed until 25 years old). If you love this girl, like you clearly said you did, then it\u2019s worth attempting to repair the relationship. Kids make mistakes, and sometimes they make BIG mistakes that are hurtful and have consequences. But it sounds like she has been punished and my guess is, she probably cares more about you not abandoning her than she does about going to Paris. So, NTA for getting angry, but I think you would be TA to both of you if you don\u2019t attempt to repair through therapy. Again, do not have to give her money or invite her to Paris, but if you love her then it is worth it to give her a chance to see if she\u2019s grown up.

I did not realize this was the accusation.  I 100% understand why you refuse to be around her and I think that's the right choice going forward.  I'm so, so sorry you had to deal with that.

Also, the stepdaughter and her dad planned this over a group text with the stepson, so the only reason this was resolved was because the stepson had these texts. It was a premeditated attack that could have ruined OP's life and ruined the entire family, and left her mom and brother in this horrible situation. It's more than an atrocious thing to do, it's extortion WITH evidence. OP isn't pressing charges; that is compromise enough.

Accusations of SA are treated like SA happened for a reason\u2014there is no going back from them. But that cuts both ways. If OP gives her another chance, he\u2019s setting himself up for a lifetime of walking on eggshells around her. And what is he even walking back? Overseas vacations present just as much if not more room for accusations. If anything, returning to their previous setup with the other things (school, car) gives the bio dad more ammunition because if the daughter made another false accusation and tried to walk it back, biodad and legal team could say she only did so because the privileges afforded to her by stepdad act as bribes. The only thing I can see is being at home when she\u2019s at his home. That could be fine because she should be visiting when her mom and bro are home. But actually, he should really only be around the daughter when the mom is in the room; the brother is even you get than her, so theoretically he will also be manipulated by their dad to lie. \n\nAt the end of the day, he is now the one that isn\u2019t safe around her.

If he hugs her at a holiday dinner and quietly wishes her a Merry Christmas, it could be construed as a grope and whispered threat. With a previous accusation in their history, he\u2019ll always be in doubt.", "I think he needs to wait until she is no longer a minor and can no longer lie to get him imprisoned.", "While I agree mercy is preferable in most circumstances, the risk to OP weighs, in my opinion, far more heavily. It\u2019s not a matter of forgiveness, it\u2019s a matter of protection. He could never be sure she wouldn\u2019t accuse him of SA again, plant false evidence, or defraud him.

But for the step-son\u2019s honesty in showing text messages from bio dad and sis trying to get him to support sis\u2019 story, OP would be in jail.", ">  The SD is only begging for forgiveness as she wants to go on the trip to Paris.\n\nNot just that, she viewed him as her meal ticket for a cushy life.", "Even if she\u2019s not a minor she can still lie and ruin his life. There is no age limit on SA. Plus he\u2019s a small public figure so even just a hint of a rumour is enough to ruin his career. She wouldn\u2019t even have to make a believable lie. People would just say \u201cyou know he\u2019s rumoured of SAing his stepdaughter?\u201d And that\u2019s enough to ruin everything", "Lets be honest, a bio daughter that has a loving father that takes care of her and wants for nothing, would not pull this stunt to extort money off her dad for someone else. SD has show where her loyalties lie - her \u2018real dad\u2019 & you were sadly just an ATM. Don\u2019t feel bad about going go NC forever for someone who almost destroyed your life & cant be trusted. I bet you her grovelling will increase as needs a college fund\u2026", "Have you considered having her come to family therapy as a condition of ever even considering letting her back into the edges of your life? She needs to hear how her actions hurt you and you deserve the opportunity to tell her.", "This person's all over the thread throwing out the stupidest opinions possible.", "Bro calm down you took that personally and it was directed at the other people lmao. We\u2019re on the same side. Try again. \u201cThese people\u201d are the ones giving Y T A judgements lol\u2026.", "She\u2019s old enough they could try her as an adult so yeah.", "She\u2019s 16. That\u2019s not the same as being a middle aged man who is willing to ruin a teen\u2019s life, at all (which OP seems wise enough to understand and accept, even though he\u2019s the person who was endangered, and hurt by this, and who is still dealing with the fallout). Do you take vendettas against children and tweens this seriously, too?\n\nWhat she did was ridiculous and of course she knows better, but she was being manipulated by her actual father and, as a teen, she can\u2019t fully conceptualize the knock on affects and rippling consequences of a choice like this. Again, she can definitely understand that it was wrong and that it would make his life a lot harder- and she shouldn\u2019t have done it, but teens can\u2019t really fathom all of the fallout of a scenario like this in the same way much older adults can. \n\nIf he tries to go \u201can eye for an eye\u201d and reciprocate in kind, he will both look like and be an immature, pathetic, embarrassing asshole. Even if I were a jerk I wouldn\u2019t be able to look at an adult man who was proud of something like matching a 16 year old girl\u2019s energy with anything but pity and derision. If he wants to fight the bio dad or something, that\u2019s fine- but trying to get even with the stepdaughter is just pathetic.", "Dude. She\u2019s a kid who\u2019s being brainwashed by her father. OP is right to go NC and he is also right to show empathy and not let this be something that ruins her life. Let OP be the bigger person that he clearly is.", "It\u2019s his decision and I think pursuing this could cause more issues than it\u2019s worth. He at least has a home the daughter can go to but messing with that just ends up with her not having somewhere to go which means the streets or with him which isn\u2019t really an option. Let her stay with the dad and not have to think about her housing seems reason enough. I don\u2019t think pressing charges will help even if it was the thing he should do otherwise. Just creates downstream effects that could make life harder than it already is.", "A 17-year-old under the influence of her manipulative birth father is unlikely to make good decisions, and very unlikely to fully understand the fallout of her decisions.\n\nHer personality is not set yet. She deserves a second chance when the time comes for that.", "Hardly relevant. OP is making his own decisions instead of taking a \"tit for tat\" approach.", "SS refused to meet him until recently, when it was a quick coffee meet up, supervised of course. The ex is not pushing it, so we are not pushing anything too.", "It's not a \"grudge\" like you are suggesting. She's under the influence of her father and is a risk to OP.", "i was responding to someone asking why he did not bring charges against them. That would ruin her life. Maybe learn how threads work.", "He is right to cut her off, but should not file charges. You took my comment out of context. Learn how Reddit threads work.", "I don\u2019t think think this is fair; I think the wife is scrambling to try and mend things. \n\nProblem is the daughter only shows remorse when she wants something like a fancy trip to France.", "What part of his response makes you think he is not taking this seriously. He lawyered up and is going to counseling with his wife. When it comes to these sorts of dynamics it gets messy very very quickly. OP and their wife probably love each other and the wife loves her daughter. Love is a very powerful emotion and can blind people to a lot of things. OP is doing a very rational thing with going to therapy to try and work things out with their wife. It shows that they care for them a lot but recognize there is an issue they need to work through. This can be a very complex and complicated topic that will benefit from the help of a professional to help them guide and have the hard talk that needs to happen", "Your opinion is very weird. \nI\u2019m sure his wife loves her husband very much, but she also loves her daughter deeply. \nMothers have such love and grace, forgiveness and ability to look past their children\u2019s flaws. That is to be expected. Of course a mother is going to want to welcome her child back into her home, life, family and all occasions including holidays. That is her baby girl. \nIt doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love her husband and it does not mean she is \u201cusing\u201d her husband. She is not condoning her daughter\u2019s behavior, she is not saying her daughter was right. She simply wants her husband to grant her daughter the same forgiveness she has, and she can\u2019t understand why he is not willing to do that because he DOES love her daughter. \nYou are trying to turn this into something it isn\u2019t, and break up a whole family for no reason. \n\nNTA but I do think you should sit down,  calmly and lovingly with your wife to talk it all out and maybe come to a compromise. Tell her it will happen when YOU are ready, but consider giving her another chance just to see how genuine her supposed remorse is. Take it with a grain of salt, of course, I wouldn\u2019t grant her full access to come live in your home, have an allowance and all the previous privileges you provided for her. \nJust tell your wife that you will  CONSIDER, in due time,  allowing SD to repair the damage she has done and if necessary, explain the severity of the situation to your wife as respectfully as possible.", "This is what I was looking for. \n\nI get OP being upset. This is awful. IMO, get through the Paris trip then sit down and see if anything can be salvaged. \n\nOP, what would you have done if this *was* your biological daughter and she had pulled something similar? You\u2019re at a point where things could be turned around still, but continuing to alienate her is just going to make her feel that your love is conditional and she can\u2019t ever screw up or you\u2019ll withhold it.", "Nonsense IMO. The fact he's not pressing charges could create even more doubt in people's eyes that the accusations were legitimate because he must be hiding something or doesn't want something to be found if he's not willing to take action against obviously false charges of such a nature. In this current climate I'd take zero chances with something like this and bring the hammer down on anything that implicated me. OPs response to this is going to be judged just as much as anything else in this story.", "No they didn't, at first my wife couldn't afford to, then when we got together, it was years later and we didn't think it was necessary. And we were, obviously, wrong.", "I wouldn\u2019t step foot near her again and even letting her in the house feels like a risk. False rape accusations ruin lives and make it worse for real victims of abuse. I could never trust that she wouldn\u2019t pull the same stunt again and maybe she would \u201clearn from her mistakes\u201d and plant evidence or something to substantiate her claims. Very scary stuff, I get wanting to stay with his wife but I would be very concerned that she could throw naked pictures of her or some biological material in or on his stuff and call again. Even if this was completely her father\u2019s idea they could regroup and figure out how to do it \u201cbetter\u201d next time or she could take this upon herself to make sure she gets her daddy\u2019s payday and approval in the future. I\u2019d be worried about my own home and would want them meeting at a neutral third party location. She has shown herself to be devious and willing to make fake rape accusations once, what\u2019s stopping her from trying again.", "But they didn't..and it doesn't even sound like it was discussed in a serious fashion...  A little.probation at best..  So no, not the same as ending up on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life.", "Yes I know that. I feel a bit sorry for the kid, she\u2019s been manipulated and used as a pawn and she is the one who has lost everything- her allowance and car and private school and friends. But she is also a child and doesn\u2019t realise the severity of the impact of what she\u2019s done.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he should trust her and let her move back in , actions have consequences but he can forgive her because holding onto things is toxic.", "If life were fair she would be facing charges. If she ruined her own life, well, she would learn then huh?\n\nSaying her life would be ruined is a bit of a stretch, as she\u2019s a minor, if she managed to keep her nose clean until 18, most places would expunge her record.", "Op could have gone to jail.\n\nAside from damaging his reputation.\n\nDo you know what happens to men that hurt children in jail??\n\nOP\u2019s wife has no right to demand any type of compromise or forgiveness from OP.\n\nYou can say stepdaughter was just a child being manipulated, we\u2019ll look at the 12 year old who knew right from wrong. \n\nStep daughter had no excuse to do this to someone who treated her as their own and even bought them a friggin car.", "Teenage screw up means sneaking out to parties, trying alcohol, etc, not calling CPS on your stepdad for false abuse charges. OP doesn't have to waste a single minute of his time on this sorry excuse of a daughter.", "Once she is out of childhood I would give her a second chance. I've seen it plenty of times where parents come back out of the blue and kids don't have the tools to deal with emotional manipulation for example. They panic.\n\nI am an example, I loved my dad but being with him upset my mom so she would constantly tell me if I was nice to him that I was choosing to leave our family. \n\nI know she is older and you are rightfully disgusted/angry/disappointed. But know that she may actually be remorseful and not understand how to move forward. \n\nI would also try to figure out what manipulation her dad used.", "And how do you expect the low contact with your stepdaughter to work in the long run? \n\nBirthday parties of your wife and stepson? \nAccoplishments of your son? \nFamily vacations where your wife has to exclude your daughter?", "It is only by OP\u2019s grace that she wasn\u2019t charged either way.", "Where did it say anywhere in the OP that the abuse was sexual? Seems like you added that bit in there.", "But she's not a child.. her younger brother is, and he realized the severity of it and refused to participate", "I didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \nI didn\u2019t say it was okay.\nI didn\u2019t say that SD didn\u2019t know better. \nI didn\u2019t say anything like that. \nI am not minimizing what happened. \n\nI\u2019m simply saying that he should explain the severity of the situation to his wife and if he feels led to, tell her that he will CONSIDER forgiveness but it will happen when HE feels ready. And that is simply for the sake of his marriage and because he DOES love that girl regardless of what she did. \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean things will be the same. Doesn\u2019t mean she will get a car, allowance, expensive vacations, or to live in his home. I did not suggest that. \n\nHe needs to communicate with his wife and come to a compromise. The compromise here would be him telling her that he will CONSIDER forgiving her. It doesn\u2019t mean he will. It doesn\u2019t mean he will communicate with SD any time soon. It just means he will consider it because it\u2019s important to his wife and he loves her. That\u2019s really all he can do here."]}
