You are the child. If the parents wanted a better relationship with you, they should have been and should still be actively attempting to mend that relationship.  It\u2019s not on you.

This whole situation is so sad.  You got so used to being independent and no one caring about what you did.  If you want them to be part of your life now, it would take some work.  Is it worth it?  Do you want that?  Even if your parents say that they want it, will they work on it?  There are a lot of unknowns.  It would be a big risk to let them into your life more.  Only you can decide if it is worth it.  I would suggest seeing a counselor about it if you decide that is a possibility.

Nope.", "NTA\n\nThey didn't help plant the corn, harvest the grain or bake the bread.\n\nBut they want the award.\n\nMaybe try telling them what you told us. If they shift blame or guilt you, continue to move on with your life without including them in on the details.", "NTA. Your parents broke your heart first by literally only caring about one child when they had two. I get that it wasn't easy to have a sick child, but when you have more than one child then you act like it.", "Hahaha that ridiculous of your sister to make that statement. NTA. Your parents fucked up and didn\u2019t mend the relationship. It\u2019s on them", "NAH\n\nIt just seems like an overall sad situation to me. I hope you can all mend the gap someday.", "NAH get family therapy", "This is incredibly hard, because I see where you're coming from.   \n\n\nAt the same time, I've watched this play out in my own family. My aunt was born with a severe brain abnormality and died before I was born. My uncle is still bitter because between my aunt and my mom (long story, but my mom is a failure) he didn't get the attention he needed. He's now extremely bitter and angry, and despite the fact that he is quite literally a millionaire nothing makes him happy because he's too busy being bitter at his parents and the world in general.   \n\n\nI think you are already angry, but I think the best thing to do would be to sit down and have an extremely honest conversation about how you feel. There are things you need to acknowledge: first, that your parents HAD to care for your sister. Second, that you wanted and needed them there, but they weren't. Third, this has lead you to feel that you don't matter to them and so you act like you don't matter to them- hence not telling them about your life.  At the very least, you need to be firm and take the lead on this FOR YOURSELF. If you extend an olive branch and they reject you constantly that is on them, but you need to do what is right FOR YOU, so that you are acting out of kindness and not bitterness.   \n\n\nSo, I would say, YTA for now; however, if you address this and make a road for your parents to make things right with you and they don't make an attempt to give some time to you then by all means, they are TA.   \n\n\nOn a more personal note, I had severe epilepsy as a child and my siblings made fun of me non-stop. It really hurt our relationship. In no way do I think you did the same thing, but just know it's really hard to deal with a physical ailment that you can't control. Have you and your sister tried to work through this at all?", "NAH. Your reasons for not even thinking to tell them is understandable. Their disappointment is also understandable. \n\nAlso remember, they loved you during that difficult period. If you were the sick child your sister would be the one ignored. They just didn't manage your sister's health combined with parenting you well. It's incredibly difficult for a parent, but they still love you. They are probably feeling guilty and sad for the past and aren't expressing that well. Instead are looking at this one situation and not what led up to it. \n\nYou might find some emotional healing to have a conversation when everyone is calm and can talk without a current situation muddying the waters. \n\nIf your family is agreeable, therapy to untangle everyone's feelings would be helpful. We carry these feelings with us forever if we don't work to address them. And they rear their ugly heads at the most inopportune times.\n\nEdited to add: what I should have said first. Congratulations for the award. You persevered through something that would cripple many adults. You found your way. Stay strong. \n\nAs someone who went through their own trauma as a kid, please get yourself some help to work through these emotions. Therapy, support group, books. I read many books around schizophrenia and growing up with a schizophrenic parent because that's what I had to work through. It helped more than I can express in words. \n\nSometimes, just knowing the story of another can help you heal yourself.", "Gentle YTA. Your parents didn\u2019t WANT to completely abandon you didn\u2019t your sisters cancer treatment. In fact, it probably tears them up inside that they couldn\u2019t be there for you more during that time. This exact thing happened to my family during my own cancer treatment and my sister still resents my mother for her having to take care of me and not being there for her. But their relationship is finally getting better with time, but only because my sister is allowing my mom to be there for her now. \n\nYour parents probably regret how things went and feel horrible about it. Give them the opportunity to make things up now. If you continue to hide things and exclude them from your life, they\u2019ll never get better, and one day YOU\u2019LL be regretting how YOU handled your relationship with them.", "YTA. They are trying to repair the relationship, but you have to meet them halfway. This all definitely sounds like passive-aggressive punishment.  If you want a relationship with your parents you will have to do your part and that means informing them about your life.", "Soft YTA .\n\nI get it. It hurt to have to pick yourself up and live your life without your parents showering you with affection. I think everyone deserves to have parents that show interest in them and show they care. \n\nIt's not their fault that your sister had cancer. And honestly I do not blame them for putting so much energy into your sister and her treatment. Any illness is unfortunate, but cancer especially causes fear, which is going to keep that cancer on the forefront of their mind.\n\nI think you're hurt and now that you can tell they want back in, you want to put that hurt onto them, turn it around on them. Which is understandable, but at the end of the day, it's not helping them, it's not helping your sister, and most of all it's not helping you.", "NAH you sound bitter tho", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially with OP becoming an adult, it will be easier to strengthen the relationship now than if you wait.\n\nIt's good you learned to be independent and strong on your own.

I personally don't define that as survivorship. Also kinda doubt the last 3 years have been \"stress-free\" as it relates to cancer", "I also had a friend who had beaten brain cancer, only for it to come back a decade later and spread to his lungs.

Even when people don't necessarily want to cause her hurt. I think this might the biggest thing in her life that is keeping her from more happiness. \n\nThat your parents go into defence/ hurt when they hear you won the award might be because they are proud?

As bad and as horrible it is to see your child suffering and going through cancer, they still have a second child and should still be there for you, because you were a child too and needed them.

Most of those families find ways to stay connected to their healthy kids even while going through hell with the sick one. Even when they have to be apart from the healthy kids for long periods, they stay involved. Yet there are a few who, like you, get overlooked because the parents can't cope with the stress. For those kids, we recommend counseling. I hope you consider talking to someone, even if it's just to vent \n\nCongratulations on your award.", "NTA.

I've eaten so many meals alone during middle and high school, but now I know they were dealing with a lot and got almost burned out without having everything crumble so I've come to deeply respect them. \n\nAnyway I got a bunch of awards for school projects and for singing, but I never told them anything because I thought they didn't have interest in that, to the point that I took the train or asked my teachers a for a lift to go compete or get the award. Almost all of them were like a piece of paper so i put them all in a box I kept in my room, except one that was a golden mic statuette and I put that on a shelf over my bed, but they seemed to not have noticed that (later they told me they noticed it and thought it was like a present from my music school, because they never read the plaque underneath and forgot to ask), hence fueling the feeling of them not caring. \n\nYears passed, I was attending university, my sister was finally well, my grandparents sadly resting in peace. There was need for me to empty my room at home so I got my mum to help me. She found the box and casually opened it and started having a panic attack and crying because I kept many happy moments from them. We, my parents and I, had a very long nice chat, and it comes out that they were simply so glad I at least was seemingly doing fine and that they thought I simply had a quiet personality and preferred not being inquired about and feared that asking me would lead to me reacting badly and create more stuff to deal with, meanwhile I was not saying anything because I didn't think they would have had interest in me and moreover I grew the fear of them actually saying they didn't have any interest. \n\nWe all share the responsibility of our relationship drying out or better no one has the responsibility, because after a storm when you are lost at sea anything that floats seems a nice place to rest and you don't ask how it got there, you just hop on and don't complain that it is not a proper boat. \n\nSo IMHO no one is TA in your story. Things between you and your parents adjusted that way because of external causes, but that doesn't mean they didn't care, they possibly run out of hope and will for active improvement and didn't want to touch something that was at least working after so many things not working, with the risk of breaking it.

OP, this might be a good time to explain why you didn't invite them and see if they'd be willing to meet for some family therapy to mend some broken heart strings on all ends.", "100% not the asshole. But I think it\u2019s worth explicitly explaining to them where you are coming from. Let them know you\u2019re not punishing them but, also, it\u2019s not your fault or your problem that they feel this way, because of where you are, and who you\u2019ve become in life. if they are sad and feel shitty, that\u2019s not on you and you need to let them know that it\u2019s not your fault Life has turned out this way. It\u2019s just a result of what had happened. If they want to build some sort of stronger relationship with you, they\u2019re gonna have to put in the effort. Plain and simple.", "them realizing that they want to spend more time w OP? In the post it doesn't seem they avoided to spend time with her, they simply had to be more w the sick sister", "The hard part is this is a perfect example of the phrase, 'no child is raised by the same parent(s)'. OPs sister was raised by loving, attentive parents. It's likely that OPs sister won't be able to imagine OPs perspective and likely has developed no empathy for OP. It'd be like talking to a wall for OP to express themselves to the sister.", "They\u2019re still failing OP. They don\u2019t care about them, they just care that they weren\u2019t included, and for sister to be butting in, is even worse, and further proof that she is still the golden and important child, and OP is just the other one.", "At some point in life they should have stopped make mistakes,.what was the purposes of this they made op sad, they went out of their way to do it, frankly if you continue to do mistake then go f yourself.", "They\u2019re proving who they are now by involving the sister in emotionally manipulative behavior towards OP for their choice to fail as parents.", "LOL it\u2019s definitely the child\u2019s duty to be the adult when their parents emotionally abandoned them through the formative years of their life and are now salty that they don\u2019t get to be beloved wonderful parents.", "You don't get to ignore your kid for years and then stil have them tell you everything as if you're close.\n\nYou ain't. Sit down.", "Nope, parents chose to have 2 children. One required a lot of attention, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all ok that they just stop being a parent to the other. It IS the parent\u2019s fault. They failed OP miserably, and they should be putting in the work to be parents again if they even see there\u2019s a problem. People need to stop putting things like this on literal children just trying to survive when they have been abandoned.", "Nope it's  time for the parents  to adapt  to the current  reality  and the consequences of forgetting  they have a second  child  while  the other one was sick. Op is fine as  she is ,there  s no need to relearn anything \n\nBesides  what if God forbids  the sister  get sick again, should  op relearn to be independent =no parent available?\n\nNta  op", "Not really. I can ask people what's up plenty of times, but they can just say \"Same old, same old\", while planning world domination. Especially if they have built a communication structure, where OP resents her parents and has stopped sharing news to avoid being hurt by their lack of response.\nThis family might need family therapy.", "Bingo!", "You're not telling OP to be honest, you're telling her to stab them in the throat (metaphorically) watch them blead out then walk out like the little girl meme who burns the house down.\n\nWe're all vampires around here, and we can't feed if OP isn't bleeding. You're \"honesty\" is just that, a knife on the wrist, something to encourage OP to keep the wound fresh and dripping.", "I mean, they probably did, and I feel for them. But you gotta take care of your other kid, too.", "Yeah, I feel like OP would have mentioned the award if their parents asked how OP was with genuine interest and responded positively and supportively to OPs responses on the regular. OP really didn't do anything wrong here. This was OPs family relationship as normal. How many other positive moments or negative moments have the parents missed by just not bothering to ask OP how they were? Tons. Tons.", "You seem sheltered. I'm always honest with everyone about everything. It is FANTASTIC. Besides she asked, so the truth would be \"because you never cared before\" and if the mom cries it's her problem. Or should she keep it bottled until she abandons her mom in an old folks home resenting her for never understanding the rift they have in their relationship or what caused it.   \nWhat the hell is your problem?", "From what I could read OP is mature enough to understand that her parents had to take care of her sick sis but their major gripe is that they didn't bother to even after the kid got better", "Adding on to this, the parents seem to have forgotten they had another child.  OP was the good one who didn\u2019t cause any trouble.  Well, OP  made her own life.  At some point, she will make a family worth being part of.  It sounds as if she is well on the way to doing so with her group of friends.  \n\nOP, congratulations on your award!  That is fantastic!", "Life isn\u2019t fair. They were shitastic parents to OP. There is really no excuse. My dad had cancer and died when I was a child. He was a better parent than them.", "Yes, but there are a 1000 moments a day that a parent can snap off a text to the non sick kid, or sneak a hug in. That's what OP is feeling the loss of. OP would have been better being shipped off to a relatives house to grow up. The parents have caused OP permanent pain and it will leave a gap in the relationship for the rest of their lives and they don't appear to be truly interested in repairing that gap.", "Yes. Why is she responsible for paying room and board when she got herself into college with literally no help from her parents? I can understand them having tremendous anxiety about their younger daughter's cancer, but they Have to remember that they have Two children and that OP's needs have gone unmet for a LONG time. Forcing her to pay rent and guilt tripping her about not mentioning her award borders on narcissism.", "Everything is subjective, in all fairness.\n\nWhen my baby brother was very young (about 2/3 years old) he had a grand mal seizure, and to this day that was one of the worst things i have ever seen. I've been through and seen things that some people would generally agree are worse but to me, it was a horrible horrible sight that still pops into my head sometimes. \n\nI remember during that situation i couldn't think or plan, I wasn't even the one who called an ambulance. I grabbed him and ran him over to our old neighbor who was a nurse and she was the one that called. She ended up having to take care of our other brother because the fear and horror of the situation had left me borderline unresponsive until i knew he was okay", "well my friend i was talking about ongoing stressful situations like war camps and living in poverty. You described shock which is different. Sorry you had to go through that", "Actually, you seem a little misinformed!\n\nShock can last *way* longer than hours or minutes. You can actually go into shock for extremely long periods of time where your brain shuts down and gets stuck in a loop of replaying whatever it was over and over again, essentially making you 'go through the motions'. You know those movie montages where someone gets bad news and it shows them stumbling around blindly doing everything on autopilot?\n\nThat's actually not far off and for some people it can last until the bad situation is over or even beyond it, *especially* with situations that may have bad news coming in over and over again. Shock can also manifest in several different ways, ranging from denial to anger. You never know[:\n\nThat said, OP is NTA at all."]}
