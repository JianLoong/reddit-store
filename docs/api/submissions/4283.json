You are the child. If the parents wanted a better relationship with you, they should have been and should still be actively attempting to mend that relationship.  It\u2019s not on you.

This whole situation is so sad.  You got so used to being independent and no one caring about what you did.  If you want them to be part of your life now, it would take some work.  Is it worth it?  Do you want that?  Even if your parents say that they want it, will they work on it?  There are a lot of unknowns.  It would be a big risk to let them into your life more.  Only you can decide if it is worth it.  I would suggest seeing a counselor about it if you decide that is a possibility.

Nope.", "NTA\n\nThey didn't help plant the corn, harvest the grain or bake the bread.\n\nBut they want the award.\n\nMaybe try telling them what you told us. If they shift blame or guilt you, continue to move on with your life without including them in on the details.", "NTA. Your parents broke your heart first by literally only caring about one child when they had two. I get that it wasn't easy to have a sick child, but when you have more than one child then you act like it.", "Hahaha that ridiculous of your sister to make that statement. NTA. Your parents fucked up and didn\u2019t mend the relationship. It\u2019s on them", "NAH\n\nIt just seems like an overall sad situation to me. I hope you can all mend the gap someday.", "NAH get family therapy", "This is incredibly hard, because I see where you're coming from.   \n\n\nAt the same time, I've watched this play out in my own family. My aunt was born with a severe brain abnormality and died before I was born. My uncle is still bitter because between my aunt and my mom (long story, but my mom is a failure) he didn't get the attention he needed. He's now extremely bitter and angry, and despite the fact that he is quite literally a millionaire nothing makes him happy because he's too busy being bitter at his parents and the world in general.   \n\n\nI think you are already angry, but I think the best thing to do would be to sit down and have an extremely honest conversation about how you feel. There are things you need to acknowledge: first, that your parents HAD to care for your sister. Second, that you wanted and needed them there, but they weren't. Third, this has lead you to feel that you don't matter to them and so you act like you don't matter to them- hence not telling them about your life.  At the very least, you need to be firm and take the lead on this FOR YOURSELF. If you extend an olive branch and they reject you constantly that is on them, but you need to do what is right FOR YOU, so that you are acting out of kindness and not bitterness.   \n\n\nSo, I would say, YTA for now; however, if you address this and make a road for your parents to make things right with you and they don't make an attempt to give some time to you then by all means, they are TA.   \n\n\nOn a more personal note, I had severe epilepsy as a child and my siblings made fun of me non-stop. It really hurt our relationship. In no way do I think you did the same thing, but just know it's really hard to deal with a physical ailment that you can't control. Have you and your sister tried to work through this at all?", "NAH. Your reasons for not even thinking to tell them is understandable. Their disappointment is also understandable. \n\nAlso remember, they loved you during that difficult period. If you were the sick child your sister would be the one ignored. They just didn't manage your sister's health combined with parenting you well. It's incredibly difficult for a parent, but they still love you. They are probably feeling guilty and sad for the past and aren't expressing that well. Instead are looking at this one situation and not what led up to it. \n\nYou might find some emotional healing to have a conversation when everyone is calm and can talk without a current situation muddying the waters. \n\nIf your family is agreeable, therapy to untangle everyone's feelings would be helpful. We carry these feelings with us forever if we don't work to address them. And they rear their ugly heads at the most inopportune times.\n\nEdited to add: what I should have said first. Congratulations for the award. You persevered through something that would cripple many adults. You found your way. Stay strong. \n\nAs someone who went through their own trauma as a kid, please get yourself some help to work through these emotions. Therapy, support group, books. I read many books around schizophrenia and growing up with a schizophrenic parent because that's what I had to work through. It helped more than I can express in words. \n\nSometimes, just knowing the story of another can help you heal yourself.", "Gentle YTA. Your parents didn\u2019t WANT to completely abandon you didn\u2019t your sisters cancer treatment. In fact, it probably tears them up inside that they couldn\u2019t be there for you more during that time. This exact thing happened to my family during my own cancer treatment and my sister still resents my mother for her having to take care of me and not being there for her. But their relationship is finally getting better with time, but only because my sister is allowing my mom to be there for her now. \n\nYour parents probably regret how things went and feel horrible about it. Give them the opportunity to make things up now. If you continue to hide things and exclude them from your life, they\u2019ll never get better, and one day YOU\u2019LL be regretting how YOU handled your relationship with them.", "YTA. They are trying to repair the relationship, but you have to meet them halfway. This all definitely sounds like passive-aggressive punishment.  If you want a relationship with your parents you will have to do your part and that means informing them about your life.", "Soft YTA .\n\nI get it. It hurt to have to pick yourself up and live your life without your parents showering you with affection. I think everyone deserves to have parents that show interest in them and show they care. \n\nIt's not their fault that your sister had cancer. And honestly I do not blame them for putting so much energy into your sister and her treatment. Any illness is unfortunate, but cancer especially causes fear, which is going to keep that cancer on the forefront of their mind.\n\nI think you're hurt and now that you can tell they want back in, you want to put that hurt onto them, turn it around on them. Which is understandable, but at the end of the day, it's not helping them, it's not helping your sister, and most of all it's not helping you.", "NAH you sound bitter tho", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially with OP becoming an adult, it will be easier to strengthen the relationship now than if you wait.\n\nIt's good you learned to be independent and strong on your own. It's time to relearn to request your parents attention. Clearly everyone forgot how, and that's no one's fault.", "If you don\u2019t make time for your children when they\u2019re teenagers and begging for you to notice them, the relationship is probably always going to be distant.", "Not at all. You cannot neglect a child and expect to keep a relationship. Life sucks sometimes, but parents need to be the adults. OP has essentially learned to function without them, and that's not going to get undone any time soon.

Watching your kid fight cancer... wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.\n\nThat being said, while it may take some time, hoping OP and parents re conciliate at some point in time.\n\nLife just threw a really hard curve at them early on.

I personally don't define that as survivorship. Also kinda doubt the last 3 years have been \"stress-free\" as it relates to cancer", "I also had a friend who had beaten brain cancer, only for it to come back a decade later and spread to his lungs.

Even when people don't necessarily want to cause her hurt. I think this might the biggest thing in her life that is keeping her from more happiness. \n\nThat your parents go into defence/ hurt when they hear you won the award might be because they are proud?

OP deserved love and attention but the parents went through crazy trauma as did OPs sister.  Watching your child suffer every day for years is unthinkably brutal.

As bad and as horrible it is to see your child suffering and going through cancer, they still have a second child and should still be there for you, because you were a child too and needed them. It wasn't ignoring you, but they focused on just one person. Of course you adapt to their behavior by doing everything yourself. I wouldn't have told them.

You have accepted what they have done, they haven't.", "I don't think YTA. \n\nI'm reading this as you didn't mention it to your parents because they've never really showed an interest in anything important to you. If my understanding is accurate, than absolutely NTA. I mean, if you've got a history of \"Mom! Dad!  I just got Big Achievement Important To Me!\" And they go \"Mm'kay,\" then you hit that point of Why Bother. Eventually, you just stop sharing your dreams and interests. I totally get that. \n\nIf you deliberately withheld information because you knew it would hurt them, I'd lean toward AH. I don't get that from your post. \n\nI've done a lot of volunteer work with families who have kids with catastrophic illnesses. Most of those families find ways to stay connected to their healthy kids even while going through hell with the sick one. Even when they have to be apart from the healthy kids for long periods, they stay involved. Yet there are a few who, like you, get overlooked because the parents can't cope with the stress. For those kids, we recommend counseling. I hope you consider talking to someone, even if it's just to vent \n\nCongratulations on your award.", "NTA.
