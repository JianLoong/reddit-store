There are many things that are taken into consideration other than just whether you can afford the mortgage and what debt you have currently. Available credit is potential future debt and must also be considered when calculating whether a person(s) can afford the mortgage.

Depending on what your score is and how much the line was for, your lender can back out on the deal since your approval was based on scores and numbers that no longer exist.  \n\nHard pulls before offer acceptance can impact the rate you get.  The higher the credit, the less risky you are to the lender. So any pulls or new lines need to be reported to your lender so they can re-run via a soft pull and adjust their position.  \n\nA new CC represents the potential for a higher debt to income ratio and decreases your average age of credit.  How much of an impact depends on a variety of factors - overall debt to income ratio, repayment history, current credit score, and even work history.  A hard pull can drop your score anywhere from 10-25 points.  If OPs credit was on the low end of good, a hard pull and a new line of credit could easily drop them down to the fair range.  Usually mortgage lenders will tell anyone in the home buying process to avoid any and all new lines unless their credit is well into the excellent range (meaning they can take the hit and still have an excellent score), a low debt to income ratio (demonstrating they don\u2019t rack up debt), and have high enough income to demonstrate the ability to repay should it be maxed out at any point. \n\nDespite all that OP - YTA because they never actually viewed this person as a friend - just someone in their life to constantly help or fix their issues.

It doesn't surprise me that she's upset about it, but I think there probably was something you could have done like help her pay for another night in the hotel or the equivalent of whatever that reward was to help her out.
