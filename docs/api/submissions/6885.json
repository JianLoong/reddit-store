So I don't actually fault him for not doing so. \n\nHowever dude bro could have gotten a uhaul. I imagine she's most likely still struggling after losing her home, now is really not the best time to be asking a friend for help when they've most likely already have so much shit on their plates.", "Oop comments clarify that his friend was asking him to apply for a credit card as one of her referred friends. Her other friend applied for the card instead so applying is what was happening here. \n\nAlso many money experts will tell you not to apply for credit shortly before applying for a mortgage, they also tell you not to change banks shortly before applying either. There are many things that are taken into consideration other than just whether you can afford the mortgage and what debt you have currently. Available credit is potential future debt and must also be considered when calculating whether a person(s) can afford the mortgage. Changes in your financial behaviour is an indicator of possible financial instability and banks particularly are more careful following the collapse of the bank's and the huge financial crisis a few years back. Banks are obligated to be particularly stringent nowadays. \n\nEven if the impact is minimal no one is obligated to get a credit card in their name to help someone else.", "So referral links are generated to give points to existing customers for referring new people who get approved. So for this scenario to make sense the friend is the current customer and OP isn\u2019t - which means opening a line will impact their credit.  \n\nHard pulls while ACTIVELY (offer accepted) in the process does impact your credit score and usually changes your closing date.   Depending on what your score is and how much the line was for, your lender can back out on the deal since your approval was based on scores and numbers that no longer exist.  \n\nHard pulls before offer acceptance can impact the rate you get.  The higher the credit, the less risky you are to the lender. So any pulls or new lines need to be reported to your lender so they can re-run via a soft pull and adjust their position.  \n\nA new CC represents the potential for a higher debt to income ratio and decreases your average age of credit.  How much of an impact depends on a variety of factors - overall debt to income ratio, repayment history, current credit score, and even work history.  A hard pull can drop your score anywhere from 10-25 points.  If OPs credit was on the low end of good, a hard pull and a new line of credit could easily drop them down to the fair range.  Usually mortgage lenders will tell anyone in the home buying process to avoid any and all new lines unless their credit is well into the excellent range (meaning they can take the hit and still have an excellent score), a low debt to income ratio (demonstrating they don\u2019t rack up debt), and have high enough income to demonstrate the ability to repay should it be maxed out at any point. \n\nDespite all that OP - YTA because they never actually viewed this person as a friend - just someone in their life to constantly help or fix their issues. Even without the card, there are lots of other ways OP could help.

I can\u2019t see anyway how this would mess his credit up.", "For what it\u2019s worth, credit is really paradoxical. A hard pull on your credit, like applying for a credit card, will take you down a few points for a few months. But also paying off your student loans will take you down more than a few points because you just lost a long term credit line with positive history. So if you are LITERALLY about to buy a house, don\u2019t change ANYTHING. If you just have an idea for the not to distant future, it shouldn\u2019t matter much AS LONG AS you either don\u2019t use it or pay it off every month (and it has no annual fee, of course). \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not opening a CC for anyone.
