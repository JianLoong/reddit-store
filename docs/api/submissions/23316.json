Like you can be the whitest white girl and be Spaniard, those two don't contradict each other.\n\n2) In Spain, we don't have the tradition where one person takes their spouses surname. Everyone here has 2 surnames, one that comes from one parent and the other surname from the other parent. I guess he got used to the US way of doing it becasue in Spain we do not do that, and we have long names because we have Name Surname1 Surname2 so I don't get his opossition to the double barrel name thing either since it would be pretty similar on how we do it in Spain.\n\n3) If your friends are makeing jokes about your husbands surname, maybe you need better friends, they seem racist.", "NTA.

I want to point out some things though, that caught my attention as a Spanish (Spain) person.\n\n1) I'm so white I could honestly be classified as transparent, so forget about the Spanish last name white skin thing, you have a whole ass country with it. Also it's 2023, the world is pretty mixed.\n\n2) There's something ironic about being Spanish and proud, but deciding that it's a must that your partner takes your last name, which is not common practice in Spain lmao. People have 2 last names, one from the dad and the other fom the mom (unless we're talking single mom's kids that just take their mother's as far as I know). But marrying doesn't change it.\n\nNow, I know it's fueled by cultural differences, but I'm a firmly believer that taking your partner's surname is misogynistic (the woman has to take it as a symbol of property, come on) and weird af because... now you have the same surname as your SIL? Like if I told you about Mary Brown and Michael Brown, would you be able to figure out if they're married or siblings unless I clarified it? I don't know it has always felt counterproductive to me. More so when it comes to divorcing, or legal papers, like you may appear with different surnames in different documents depending of your marital status at that point. That sounds confusing and a hassle. But alas, if someone does it, it's not like I'm going to bitch about it to them, I've met people who have done if because they have a bad relationship with their original last name or just don't mind it, and it's as valid as people who don't want to take the new name. \n\nThis is a two yes situation for me.\n\nEdit to add that saying that having the same surname is \"having a proper family\" is ridiculous.

Trust me, if he is Spanish his issue is not with the long name.\n\nI actually think you suck a bit for your reason for not taking his name. Not enough for considering you an AH though. I'm all for not taking the husband's name. I think it's a misogynistic tradition. Women shouldn't change their identity because of who they marry and I'd never be caught changing my name. The only time my partner talked about something like that I said \"If the goal is for us all to have the same last name you can take mine\" and that was the end of any possible discussion on the topic. But you don't want to because of aesthetics and that's a very shallow reason.\n\nP.s.

The fact that in some countries women change their last name to match their husband when they get married is dumb and patriarchal, ask him if he will change his to match yours so you can be a proper family. I'm Italian and Mexican and not even my great-grandmothers on other side changed their last name when they got married. \n2. In Spain it's not tradition to change last name once married, you should tell him but he should know if he's really Spanish. Or is he one of those people from the US who say they are Spanish because their great-grandfather was?\n3. It's actually more of a tradition in Spain to give children both parents' last names, so tell him not to worry, you have a solution to \"be a proper family\" if you have children\n4.

They are Western European, there is absolutely nothing weird about white people with a Spanish last name, and every single Spaniard I know is white.

We actually have several surnames, when a child is born they take their father's surname + their mother's surname, and in theory it goes back infinitely by alternsting before the father and the mother.
