I don\u2019t have anybody who I could ask that would give me an objective answer, so I\u2019ve come here.\n\nEdit because I didn't proofread before posting:\nI'm a 24 year old guy. My father also had to quit his job because of the diagnosis. His wife still works though and money is not an issue.\n\n\n\nMy father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He will begin chemotherapy soon and will need a lot of assistance. I have offered to drive him to appointments and go shopping for him and his wife which they gladly accepted.\n\nThis morning after I dropped off their groceries they took me aside and asked if I could take in my half brother (14) until the end of the summer holidays (which would be until the 6th of august, so a whole month at least). I told them I would think about it and see if it would be possible.\n\nIn truth I don\u2019t want to take him in. I would be fine with him coming over for a day every few weeks but I don\u2019t feel comfortable having a teenager living with me 24/7. Because of his age I also don\u2019t feel a real connection with him as I do with my other half brother (26) or sister (19).\n\nMy brother is unable to take him because he not only lives in a different state but is also living on base and sharing with other members of the army. He will be finished soon but it\u2019s still going to be about 3 months.\n\nMy sister is not an option either since she is now in her 2nd semester at university and living with 3 roommates. Her exam phase is also starting in the next weeks so she\u2019ll need time alone to study and focus.\n\nI guess I\u2019m the logical solution since I\u2019m living nearest to them and have my own flat but I also work full time. A lot of the time I work night shifts and sleep during the day so he would be left to his own probably more than if he just stayed home.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell my father that I don\u2019t want him to live with me though. I\u2019m already helping as much as I can so I don\u2019t really see why I should be the one to uproot my life now too.\n\nOne reason I might feel that way could also be spite. Growing up my step mom made it clear to me that I wasn\u2019t a part of their family and would never be a son to her. I hate to say it but maybe I still hold it against her in some way even if we\u2019re now friendly with each other.\n\nSo reddit, aita if I told them they\u2019d have to find a different solution for my brother?", "created_utc": 1688164221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ne7ex/aita_if_i_refuse_to_take_in_my_brother_even_if_it/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is not your responsibility, it's your step mom's. So I would go tell her no thanks, and tell your pops in a nicer way that you want to help but you have your own life to focus on but you will do other things to help out the best you can.

Focus on you and put yourself first, otherwise, others will keep walking over you and see that they can", "I don't think you're an asshole for not taking him, and It doesn't seem like it would be a good idea for him to stay with you anyway, given he'd be alone so often. He needs to be with other people who can support him.\n\nBut I'd maybe see if you can work with them to find other solutions, like a camp he can attend or a job he can get or other family who can come stay with them.\n\nBecause this is a horrifically shit situation, and in spite of your step mother being a crappy person he is your dad's kid, and I think helping find other solutions will be another way of getting support for your dad.\n\nNAH", "NTA. But your feelings for your stepmother shouldn\u2019t bleed to your brother. He\u2019s an innocent in all of this. \n\nI think since you work nights, it\u2019s best you not take him, and in your shoes, I would use that as my \u201cout\u201d.", "NTA.  It doesn't sound inconvenient, it sounds like it just won't work from a logical perspective.", "NTA. Cancer is not an excuse to pawn off children to extended family. Frankly, it is very sweet of you to offer to do grocery shopping- your father's wife should be able to handle it. \n\nOthers on Reddit will be better qualified to advise you on how to say no. I'm a blunt instrument of imprecision so if I were you, I'd just say- I can't, I have some personal limitations at the moment that don't make it the best decision for either half-brother or me to live together.", "NTA and while your father is going to need a lot of care, that doesn't mean your 14yr half brother needs to be shipped away. Sorry your father is dealing with this. \n\nPancreatic cancer is a beast - your brother shouldn't be cut off from time with his father, and he can even help a bit.

This seems very odd.", "You\u2019re not T A in not taking him in but it would be the kind thing to do. At 14 he\u2019s presumably quite independent and wouldn\u2019t need a lot of direct supervision. Don\u2019t let your previous feelings about your stepmother affect your decision, and as others have said it may be more about shielding him from being too close to what is happening with your father right now than whether your stepmother can look after him herself. It\u2019s only a month, I\u2019d do it in your shoes. Look at it this way - in 10 years time will you regret having done it, or regret not having done it, at what is a very difficult time for you all? I doubt you\u2019d ever regret helping out.", "If you're not taking him due to issues with step mom, YTA. Half or not, hes your brother and it's only a month and in that month you guys might actually build some type of relationship, find out hes kind of cool and you might be kind of a cooler older brother.

A 14yo left alone at night repeatedly seems like a bad idea overall.   Also maybe they could hire someone to help them out.  It sounds like you are doing a lot already.   The other thought is if he does stay with you he may possibly be loosing much of the last time he will ever have with his father which is not really fair to him.   Have you asked him what he wants?  At 14 he should have at least some input into the situation.", "Not judging because I don\u2019t know if there is enough info for that, but look at it this way.  Pancreatic cancer is serious and fast.  It may be less about helping them out, but protecting your brother from having to see what your father is going through.  Prognosis for pancreatic cancer is usually pretty bad and it is usually pretty fast.  They may just want to keep him from watching his father quickly get worse and die.", "NTA, you have valid reasons to say no. Are there other people he could stay with? Like an aunt/uncle, friends house? It\u2019s nice you\u2019re willing to have occasional visits and help where you\u2019re comfortable/able. Focusing on how many night shifts you have is likely the easiest reason to say no and you can offer to have him visit 1-2 times  if needed. I hope they don\u2019t pressure you - it\u2019s a stressful time but also a big ask and they should understand that. \n\nAlso your step mom is vile for saying that to you and that\u2019s fair to hold against her. Even ignoring that, your reasons are valid. If you were comfortable taking your half brother, then maybe you could look past it for your dad or half brother, but that\u2019s not the case.", "I'm not passing judgement because this is a tough one.  But you are taking your feelings for your step mother out onto your brother.  This maybe the perfect opportunity for you to get to know him better and possibly have a better relationship with him.\n\nApart from your feelings towards your step mother, is there any other reason why you can't look after him?  I gather you are working, can you work slightly shorter hours to look after him?  Could you offer to look after him for two weeks rather than 4?", "NTA. It won't be a month. You'll be stuck with him once school starts.", "NTA. Do what you need to in order to take care of yourself. Do you need to talk to your dad about anything? He could be dying and I don\u2019t want you to feel bad later about anything you could have done differently. \n\nConsider that your half brother may need a break from being home and if you decide to offer him to stay with you for as much as you decide you can handle then it could be the start of a really great relationship. Maybe just taking him out for a meal could help. Those teen years before driving kids are dependent on their parents and his are quite occupied. \n\nHe isn\u2019t responsible for his parents past actions either.

This young man is 17 years old he should be able to stay by himself, hell he can even be working. If you don't want to house a teenager and you are lending a hand in driving your dad to his appointments and picking up groceries, then you shouldn't be asked to do more.
