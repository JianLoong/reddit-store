I don\u2019t have anybody who I could ask that would give me an objective answer, so I\u2019ve come here.\n\nEdit because I didn't proofread before posting:\nI'm a 24 year old guy. My father also had to quit his job because of the diagnosis. His wife still works though and money is not an issue.\n\n\nMy father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He will begin chemotherapy soon and will need a lot of assistance. I have offered to drive him to appointments and go shopping for him and his wife which they gladly accepted.\n\nThis morning after I dropped off their groceries they took me aside and asked if I could take in my half brother (14) until the end of the summer holidays (which would be until the 6th of august, so a whole month at least). I told them I would think about it and see if it would be possible.\n\nIn truth I don\u2019t want to take him in. I would be fine with him coming over for a day every few weeks but I don\u2019t feel comfortable having a teenager living with me 24/7. Because of his age I also don\u2019t feel a real connection with him as I do with my other half brother (26) or sister (19).\n\nMy brother is unable to take him because he not only lives in a different state but is also living on base and sharing with other members of the army. He will be finished soon but it\u2019s still going to be about 3 months.\n\nMy sister is not an option either since she is now in her 2nd semester at university and living with 3 roommates. Her exam phase is also starting in the next weeks so she\u2019ll need time alone to study and focus.\n\nI guess I\u2019m the logical solution since I\u2019m living nearest to them and have my own flat but I also work full time. A lot of the time I work night shifts and sleep during the day so he would be left to his own probably more than if he just stayed home.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell my father that I don\u2019t want him to live with me though. I\u2019m already helping as much as I can so I don\u2019t really see why I should be the one to uproot my life now too.\n\nOne reason I might feel that way could also be spite. Growing up my step mom made it clear to me that I wasn\u2019t a part of their family and would never be a son to her. I hate to say it but maybe I still hold it against her in some way even if we\u2019re now friendly with each other.\n\nSo reddit, aita if I told them they\u2019d have to find a different solution for my brother?\n\n\nFor the sake of being completely honest I'd like to add that I could talk to my boss about working days instead of nights but I don't like working days since I'm more of a night person. If I were to take my brother in my step mom would also take over shopping and appointments so I wouldn't have to do that anymore. It's just that I'd rather go shopping once a week than share my place with another person. My brother does spend time with my father every day but they want to keep him from seeing the bad moments", "created_utc": 1688164221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ne7ex/aita_if_i_refuse_to_take_in_my_brother_even_if_it/", "score": 242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My dad died when I was 13 and if I had been forced to move to a different place when he was sick I would have been DEVASTATED. Aside from the fact that you're not required to raise your brother, it's not even the best decision for him. He's old enough that he doesn't need shielding from this, just honesty and support from the adults in his life.", "NTA - tell your stepmom that you are just listening to what she\u2019s always said.           \nYou are not family.           \nHe\u2019s not your brother.", "NTA - Sending your brother away for a month will not protect him. He is old enough to know his dad is very sick, and when he goes home he will see him even sicker. It just feels very unrealistic. And having an unsupervised teen at your house while you are at work, who may be struggling with your dad being sick does not sound like the best idea. Just say sorry it won\u2019t work with my work schedule, but I am happy to continue to help support you all in these other ways.", "NAH. \n\nI understand your dad and step mom don\u2019t want your bro to see dad go through all that. It\u2019s a shit situation. Watching a parent go through chemo is rough. However, this is a lot to ask of you, and might not actually be a better solution for anyone. \n\n1 major thing I think need to be considered:\n\nIs bro part of the conversation? At 14, he very likely knows what\u2019s going on, and should have a say in where he lives during all this. Maybe he\u2019d rather have the time with dad, even if it\u2019s scary and difficult. Or maybe he needs space from it all to process. Either way, unless you feel comfortable speaking candidly with your brother about this, it really is the parents\u2019 job to mitigate the situation, cold as that sounds. Don\u2019t burn your own candle at both ends if you don\u2019t have to. \n\nI am sorry, and I wish the best outcome for you all, OP.", "\"I work nights and would not be able to provide adequate supervision.\"", "I think it's also worth pointing out that palming the kid off on OP would almost certainly be *bad for the kid.* Their father has cancer, and that's awful and scary, but frankly, I'm not convinced that hiding the reality of it from him (the 14 yo) would be at all helpful to him \u2013 he knows his dad is sick, and not being able to be there could very easily lead to one of two opposite outcomes: (1) him sitting alone at OP's house, imagining the absolute worst for his father, or (2) him not realizing how much his father has declined in his absence and being deeply shocked and horrified when he does return home again. And that's before you consider that the kid is going to need more support than OP can possibly provide. \n\nAnd, *last but by no means least, if OP's father doesn't survive this, that kid will have been deprived of time with his father that he can never get back;* if I were he and in that position, I doubt I would ever forgive the people who did that to me.", "Totally agree that your stepbrother isn\u2019t your responsibility. That being said\u2026\nThink about taking your SB out for fishing, hiking, movie, day trip somewhere, etc. Get him out of the house once or twice. Talk. Watching someone you love go through cancer treatment every day is tough.", "\ud83e\udd47", "I like this answer. Plus he\u2019s 14, not 4. I completely agree with this poster: offer to take him on occasion to hang out and to help out with shopping. Include him, don\u2019t shelter him. Be there as his big brother - you\u2019ll likely both appreciate the support during all this.\n\nNTA. \nSending positive vibes to you and your family.", "I agree with this, but I will add, that watching someone quickly and traumatically die of pancreatic cancer is incredibly hard and I understand their wanting to protect the youngest from that.  My husband and I are late thirties, and watching my mother in law die of it was traumatic.  They turn bright yellow, and are in so much pain.  Their bodies decline so quickly but the mind doesn\u2019t.  It was truly horrific.  Seeing that at fourteen would have been so much more traumatic.  Another friend of ours lost her dad to it recently, and the experience was the same, fast and gruesome.  I hope someone gets OP\u2019s brother in therapy.", "I lost my husband to cancer in January 2022. Our son was 9 at the time. I did rely on my MIL to help with the kiddo more in the last months, when my husband was in and out of the hospital. But it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to me to ship him off.", "You are correct they shouldn\u2019t, but humans aren\u2019t robots and our feelings don\u2019t always follow the rules of should / shouldn\u2019t. Also, he doesn\u2019t say the spite is directed at his brother\u2014 it\u2019s directed at his stepmother and she is the one asking for a favor.", "Odd indeed.  He's 14, not 7.  Has anyone actually talked to him about what he wants to do?  He could be helpful - maybe he wants to be part of his father's care?  Maybe he doesn't want to spend what might be the last months of his father's life banished to the home of step-brother he doesn't really know (and who doesn't really want him), where he will be largely on his own anyway?", "But they may also rob him of the time he has left with his dad.  My MIL was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, by then it was quite advanced and she was gone in 6 weeks.  The very end wasn\u2019t pretty, but there were still good days and good memories.  He doesn\u2019t need to be there for all of the nitty gritty, but there will still be special times he can spend with his father that he will never get another opportunity for.", "On the other hand, it can cause resentment to his mother or brother from keeping him away from his father", "This answer needs to be upvoted more bc it is the correct one. From a medical perspective, pancreatic cancer is the worst and has the worst prognosis and lowest survival rate. I\u2019m really really sorry to OP for having to go thru this. OP should also maybe sit and have a conversation with step mom and doctor because I don\u2019t think they have a clear understanding of what the next 3 months are going to look like for their father. My heart breaks so much for you OP bc this is my worst nightmare. I also hope OP makes the most of his time with his father the next few months.", "Once school starts again he won't be home during the day so it won't be an issue for him to be there because he won't see what's going on", "I agree with this. Looking back it's just a month or so of inconvenience, but it will be a key moment in this young person's life.", "I could technically talk to my boss about changing my hours and swapping with a coworker. I just prefer night shifts. I don't want to change that and then come home and have to share my place with someone else", "I respect your willingness to do that. I honestly don't know what it is. On one side I don't want to change my routine but on the other side I worry that maybe I'm still holding a grudge and now I'm trying to punish my step mom this way somehow", "His mother will still be alive to care for him. OP can certainly be an influence in his life but it's not his responsibility to raise his half brother.", "Why? What exactly about having to take in a teenager that isn't hers and having to leave him unsupervised, during what is surely a very upsetting and difficult time for him AND for her will be a good experience?", "Logistically, this is the case. You sleep days and work nights. Staying with you would be zero supervision. The brother could get into a ton of trouble or feel like he was offloaded. \n\nYou don't have to ask to move to days. You can't. Tell them your boss said no. It's not like they can call and check, and most places don't have a schedule that flexible. \n\nFrom all standpoints, you doing errands would make the most sense. Even helping with some caretaking items for your dad, but being the guardian for your little brother, even for a month? Recipe for disaster. NTA", "This right here. You wouldn\u2019t be able to provide proper supervision given your work hours and responsibilities\u2026 how is that better than what he would have at home with step mom? Plus she\u2019s has official legal responsibility over him. So if it\u2019s you versus her on who step brother should be with when all things are equal (I.e. when there\u2019s a supervision deficit), it should be her for legal reasons in case something were to happen that requires legal authority (like medical care). \n\nSo just stick to your guns and don\u2019t give in. Just offer the once a week if you feel bad but it\u2019s better for your step bro to be at his regular home under his legal guardian\u2019s care.", "Same. I usually say I\u2019m a Bull in a china shop but this is better", "Yes, this is also my point of view. He will see the ugly, yes. But (assuming the father does not make it) I'm pretty sure that he's going to regret not spending every possible moment with his dad", "I\u2019m not judging that it is right one way or the other.  I\u2019m just offering a possible explanation for asking for him to watch out for his brother.  One could see it as \u201cget the kid out of our way for awhile\u201d vs \u201cit may be best if he doesn\u2019t have to witness all of this\u201d.", "Are you guys hiding the diagnosis from him?", "Why won't he whats going on? Is your father leaving the house at 3pm until 8am the next day?", "Taking on a child, even an almost grown one is a ton of responsibility, I wouldn't blame you for not doing it.  I would however suggest doing anything you are able to help, which you sound on board for.", "I don't envy the position you are in. Take some time and meditate on it.", "I can understand your lingering resentment towards your step mother. But remember it's not her asking for this. Not really. It's your dad. He's scared and vulnerable and he wants to protect your little brother from seeing him really ill and dying. Even just a little bit. (The first rounds of chemo are really bad, you're not supposed to share toilets and there are rules if you do etc) \n\nPlease think about the fact that this isn't about you or your step mum but an ACTUAL CHILD. He didn't exclude you from the family and he's not to blame for his mother's actions.", "The other option is he stays with his parents.\n\nIt makes sense to take him on some days to give him a break. But it sounds unreasonable to take him for a month"]}
