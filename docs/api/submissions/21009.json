I don\u2019t have anybody who I could ask that would give me an objective answer, so I\u2019ve come here.\n\nEdit because I didn't proofread before posting:\nI'm a 24 year old guy. My father also had to quit his job because of the diagnosis. His wife still works though and money is not an issue.\n\n\nMy father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He will begin chemotherapy soon and will need a lot of assistance. I have offered to drive him to appointments and go shopping for him and his wife which they gladly accepted.\n\nThis morning after I dropped off their groceries they took me aside and asked if I could take in my half brother (14) until the end of the summer holidays (which would be until the 6th of august, so a whole month at least). I told them I would think about it and see if it would be possible.\n\nIn truth I don\u2019t want to take him in. I would be fine with him coming over for a day every few weeks but I don\u2019t feel comfortable having a teenager living with me 24/7. Because of his age I also don\u2019t feel a real connection with him as I do with my other half brother (26) or sister (19).\n\nMy brother is unable to take him because he not only lives in a different state but is also living on base and sharing with other members of the army. He will be finished soon but it\u2019s still going to be about 3 months.\n\nMy sister is not an option either since she is now in her 2nd semester at university and living with 3 roommates. Her exam phase is also starting in the next weeks so she\u2019ll need time alone to study and focus.\n\nI guess I\u2019m the logical solution since I\u2019m living nearest to them and have my own flat but I also work full time. A lot of the time I work night shifts and sleep during the day so he would be left to his own probably more than if he just stayed home.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell my father that I don\u2019t want him to live with me though. I\u2019m already helping as much as I can so I don\u2019t really see why I should be the one to uproot my life now too.\n\nOne reason I might feel that way could also be spite. Growing up my step mom made it clear to me that I wasn\u2019t a part of their family and would never be a son to her. I hate to say it but maybe I still hold it against her in some way even if we\u2019re now friendly with each other.\n\nSo reddit, aita if I told them they\u2019d have to find a different solution for my brother?\n\n\nFor the sake of being completely honest I'd like to add that I could talk to my boss about working days instead of nights but I don't like working days since I'm more of a night person. If I were to take my brother in my step mom would also take over shopping and appointments so I wouldn't have to do that anymore. It's just that I'd rather go shopping once a week than share my place with another person. My brother does spend time with my father every day but they want to keep him from seeing the bad moments", "created_utc": 1688164221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ne7ex/aita_if_i_refuse_to_take_in_my_brother_even_if_it/", "score": 605, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's been over a decade and I still have trouble talking about it. May both our mamas rest in peace, knowing they are loved beyond all measures. \ud83e\udd0d And of course, counseling , individual and family if possible, should definitely be in the books for this family.", "NTA. Not your son not your problem. To be honest I would be a spiteful person if my step mom told me I wasn\u2019t part of the family. I wouldn\u2019t even forgive her since there\u2019s no law we have to forgive.", "NTA\n\nOP I have a relative who is a mother figure to me. I drove her to all her cancer appointments, surgeries, treatments, checkups, etc. For 5 years. And sat in doctor's offices and waiting rooms, and organized all her paperwork, and kept track of her schedule, and picked up her groceries and meds. Luckily she is in remission now but I can't imagine her asking something like this of me, and we both had to find ways to cheer each other up and keep each other sane through the turmoil of that experience.\n\nGive what you want to, but also know that caregiver burnout is real and it will get you if you're not paying attention to your own boundaries. It sounds like having your own place that is your personal space is a boundary for you, but you still want to be able to connect with your bro on some level (like once a week). Maybe offer that instead as a compromise, like on really hard days (like day after chemo or something), you can plan to take him out to do something you both like. Something that takes time. Bowling? Movies? Fishing? I don't know, but it is nice that you're there for your family, especially with your step mom having said something so cruel before. Be true to yourself. Best of luck to all of you.\n\nBy the way sometimes hospitals offer support groups for both patients as well as caregivers/family. If any of you are having trouble coping with this I'd recommend asking what kind of programs are available.", "NTA,  I would consider offering to take your half-brother on days when you can take him somewhere to get him out of that house for a but.  Taking on full responsibility for him is not a good idea since you work nights.", "NTA, OP. I think that instead of having to say your reasons for declining, you should tell them you feel it would be in your brother\u2019s best interest to stay at home. He should be spending as much time with her as he can, just in case the situation takes a turn for the worse. \nWhen I was a child my father\u2019s started having more and more health complications due to Type 1 Diabetes. My parents divorced when I was not even a year old so I only saw him every weekend and eventually only every other weekend. I was just becoming a teenager when his kidneys failed and he went on dialysis, could barely walk etc. \nIt was decided by my mother and stepmother that it would be better if we \u201cdidn\u2019t see him like that \u201c. We weren\u2019t even informed this decision was made. My father died after a year of us not being allowed to see him. I only got to talk to him on the phone a handful of times. \nI am not exaggerating when I say that shit fucked me up. He just completely vanished from my life, we weren\u2019t even taken to his memorial service. Act one point I had auditory hallucinations where I was told he never even existed. Serious mindfuck. I lived very recklessly for many years and put myself in so many unsafe situations, it\u2019s a miracle I\u2019m even still alive. At one point I even attempted to remove myself from this plane of existence. I have actually been diagnosed with C-PTSD because of it all. When those close to me get deathly ill, I breakdown and hide from it. To this day I am truly broken because of how things went down back then. \nThe problem with trying to skip the bad stuff is that you\u2019re really skipping ALL the stuff.", "One of the assignments I have my summer school students do to decompress is keep a \u201cLittle Book.\u201d It\u2019s a journal where we write positive affirmations and practice thankfulness. \nOne of the entries asked my students to write about their favorite person. \nOne of my girls wrote about having to spend a month with her sister. Sis was starting a nursing job in a new city and the Mom didn\u2019t want her to be alone so she sent little sis. \nShe described how at first it was awkward because her sister worked nights. But she said that even though they were not close at all in the beginning, now they are besties. \nMaybe try it out for a week at a time and see how it goes? It will take effort on both parts. \nI bet things are tense for him at home and depressing. Maybe he\u2019d enjoy being able to be alone at your place and not have to see Dad sick?\nTalk to your brother about your concerns.", "I don\u2019t have any experience with something even remotely close, but I don\u2019t understand why they want your brother out of the house. Sure, it will be rough to see dad\u2019s decline and what not, but to think your dad will pass at some point but not be able to live with him and spend as much time with him as possible seems odd and evil to me. Again, I don\u2019t have any experience with something like this, but I would think pushing a 14y/o out like that would mess him up more than him seeing the bad moments would. \nOP you\u2019re NTA for not wanting to basically become the sole provider/guardian of him. You\u2019re helping as much as you can while still supporting your own life. Just be there to support your brother, because at that age and stage of development, he just might need it more than anyone else. Spending a day with him every so often might be meaningful and helpful later down the road, too.", "You are absolutely the A-hole. Your problems with your step mom have nothing to do with that child and how he has to see the bad moments of your father being sick. Not to mention it would help your father too. I get not wanting to share your space but this is your brother and it\u2019s one month. Definitely the a-hole.", "NAH if you truly feel like you can't do it. But watching someone die is traumatic. Your see things you can't unsee, that he may not understand at his age. No ah though. You're dealing with a terrible thing and all doing the best you can. I'm sorry you have to experience this.", "NTA. You are not responsible for your half brother. You have offered the help that you are comfortable with and they can either take it or leave it.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nPlease don\u2019t take him in for his sake. As a 14 year old that was shipped off for a bit, it was an awful experience for me. \n\nSorry to hear what you\u2019re father is going through. But shipping off his kid is going to make him feel so isolated, alone and unloved. Family need to stick together at a time like this. \n\nThen there\u2019s all your reasons that are perfectly valid too.", "Does he know about the diagnosis? What does HE want to do? He\u2019s 14, not a baby. Also, likely this will not be slow for your family, so please consider stepping up and switching your schedule and doing stuff more with him, even if he doesn\u2019t move in. This is a sh*t situation and your kindness could make a big difference.", "Leaning Yta. I'm sorry everyone saying cancer is not an excuse is insane. Taking on a 14 year old is a burden, but at that age he will be at least self sufficient and doesn't need watching 24/7. Your father is in the hospital and his wife is his only caretaker besides his doctor. I'm sure the kid doesn't wanna see his dad going through sickness either. You have every right to say no but if you don't I think It's pretty messed up. Especially cause the kids not in school, he'll have to see it all the time. He's not in school, you don't hav to drive him everywhere, just pick up a few extra groceries which you can ask for money for possibly as reimbursement. I don't see any appointments happening within 1 month. For the doctor, worse case he goes to urgent care. Also everyone using the phrase \"shipped away\" that is a crazy overexaggeration. The kid is staying with someone else for ONE month.", "Nta", "NTA 14 is plenty old enough to understand everything and to pitch in and help, plus he should be home where he can be close with his sick dad.  Sounds like your step mom isn\u2019t thinking about what\u2019s best for your stepbrother.  This is the time to band together and be a family team, not shuttle your kid off to some new place where he\u2019ll be alone all day.", "I was 14 when my mom was diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer and 16 when she passed. I won't call you an AH because the entire situation sucks. But I do think you're being cold and very selfish in not being willing to even give your brother the option of staying with you. He might not take you up on it, but it would be nice for him to have a choice. My brother was 8 when my mom died and he and I initially weren't close at all. But I let him know that he could rely on me. I'm his sister and I'm there for him no matter what. I even chose not to go away for college so that I could be there for him. All these years later, I have no regrets. You're an adult and you need to stop taking out the resentment you have towards your stepmother on your little brother. And you never know; it could end up being really good for both of you.", "Don't forget to add that they cannot shield him from the \"bad moments\" and he is likely to resent it when they try.  Son's bestie was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a few years ago.  No Alex Trebeck fairy tale for him - didn't even get into chemo.  Six weeks from diagnosis to gone.  Son is so very glad he told his boss to stuff it and used up all his vacation to stay with him at the hospital and was there when he passed.  Said it was worth every second to have those final conversations.  Tell your dad and step-mom he needs to spend more time with his dad, not less.  The trauma is going to come no matter what, but those final days/hours together with his dad will means so very much to your brother later.   NTA", "NTA - Do your parents have absolutely no friends or relatives, like grandparents, who could help?", "This right here.  No guilt either...he's not your child.", "THIS!", "Your stepmother and! father! has a lot of gall to come to you to watch \\*her\\* teenage son after telling you when \\*you\\* were a child that she doesn't view you as family and will never see you as a son. And your Dad let that go unchallenged, yes?\n\nHaving residual resentment is understandable. Just remember that it wasn't just your stepmom. Your Dad went along with her attitude.\n\nAside from that, you work night shifts and, practically speaking, a 14-year-old in your care would basically be unsupervised. That's a recipe for disaster.\n\nNTA. Tell them NO without guilt. Your stepmom needs to step up to care for the son she approves of while your Dad is going through this difficult time.", "In most cases I would agree that fewer details would be best. But OP has a very valid reason in his work schedule that would be hard to dispute. I think a firm but gentle approach would be best to start with given the circumstances.", "Hospice is not all about suffering.  Yes, there will be bad times. But to be booted out of the house for a month and miss the good days?  That sounds awful.  A good friend just lost her husband.  He was in hospice care for weeks at home, and I know her family wouldn\u2019t trade those days for anything. Snuggling with Dad and board games and treats.  If it gets too much he can go to his brother\u2019s house, or go with friends.  He doesn\u2019t have to be in the room for every procedure, but to miss out on a month, especially at the beginning when his dad is still feeling relatively ok seems like a shame to me.", "I agree.  There will be some rough times, but there will also be precious moments with his father that he won\u2019t ever get back.", "Cancer is overwhelming for the entire family. 14 year old boys aren\u2019t really developmentally equipped for the trauma of a really Ill parent.\nIt\u2019s scary, everyone is stressed and sad. \n\nThe parents may feel the kid could use a break\nfrom that environment.", "Yes, I am familiar with hospice, thank you. If you reread my comment, you will realize I specifically mentioned how if dad deteriorates, hospice will be an option for the son to see and spend time with his father. At this time the parents have decided it would be in the best interest of the child if he wasn't there, which I'm sure is not a decision they take lightly.", "This needs to be top answer. The chances of Dad surviving long term with pancreatic cancer are slim and everyone's life will be irrevocably changed. Everyone will need support, but especially the 14 year old as this is a very crucial time in his emotional growth. You are NTA for being upset with your Stepmother. I am so sorry about your Dad, and I truly hope he has a recovery or at the very least a painless and peaceful end of life."]}
