You, or your father, have no obligation to change plans to accommodate her. \n\nYour aunt has such as issue with it, she can fly over and be a travel buddy for her daughter if she\u2019s that incompetent that she can\u2019t travel alone. \n\nThis is not your problem to solve.", "NTA\n\nShe's married.  She has a spouse and a second parent for her child.  If she needs help on her kid's first flight, she should be making plans to travel with her spouse so they can share parenting duties for their child.  Especially as she is traveling to attend a wedding which presumably her spouse would be invited to.\n\nIf she needs help from someone besides her spouse, she needed to ask for that.  Not ASSume it would be provided to her by default.  But she assumed and then got bit when it turned out your dad made other plans.  Oh well.\n\nAgain, if she REALLY needs to push someone for that help with her child, I suggest she start with her spouse/child's parent.  And then move to her mum.", "\"I understand what you need here  Faith But, I already made plans and the plans didn't include you. So, this just isn't doable from my end. I'm looking forward to just being with my dad. You'll have to make arrangements and work this out for yourself. I apologize for prioritizing myself, but that's not negotiable. I don't want to give up time with my dad to help you out. He's my dad, after all. *I want to spend time with him.* Hope things work out for you. Bye.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA and neither is your father. No one was even asked whether they would provide childcare! This isnot tour problem or your father's problem.", "NTA, your cousin made her plans without asking the person she was expecting to help her about them... it is not yours neither your dad's fault she didn't think asking was an important detail of her plan...\n\nYou and your father do not owe her anything and if your plans are already settled, let them be and enjoy your dad's company.", "NTA. Your dad has offered a reasonable solution, especially since it doesn't seem like he was asked if he would be willing to help. Surely your cousin can handle 1 leg of the trip on her own.", "NTA. It's completely reasonable for you to want quality time with your dad without having to take on the responsibility of hosting a guest and their baby. Your cousin should have asked your dad about his plans before assuming she could tag along. It's important to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs.", "NTA\n\nShe's not that special that you and your dad have to cancel your own plans just to accommodate her.\n\nShe cannot expect that everyone will drop everything to help her out - and then to react that aggressive is simply the icing on the cake.", "NTA. You dad should not have to give up a visit with his family.  It would be nice to invite her if you could but if that\u2019s not possible, she\u2019s an adult and will have to figure it out on her own. Maybe bring a friend with her to help her with the baby on the flights.", "NTA. Also I know 1 year olds are hard but plenty of people solo travel with their 1 y/o, it\u2019s hard but not impossible. Especially bc it\u2019s only a short time that she wouldn\u2019t have your dad\u2019s help. If she can\u2019t handle a bit of time alone traveling with her kid she should reconsider going or find someone else to go with her", "NTA. The second Dad said she should meet him at B airport to travel to C, she should\u2019ve known that was the polite way of saying no.", "You didn't interfere, your dad had his own plans. She's a grown ass woman, she can ask him herself.\n\nAnd if the answer is no, then the answer is no. Most airlines can provide special assistance with young children, and the wedding is next year, she can figure it out.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it sounds like your dad wants it to be just the two of you also since he told her to meet him at point b.", "NTA - You and your dad don't own her anything. Plus, she anticipated and believed, in her head, that she had a claim to your father's time,", "NTA.\n\nYour dad has a plan.  You have a plan.  They depend on one another because they were made with each other\u2019s consent and knowledge.  \n\nCousin made a plan on her own, no consent or knowledge and TOLD others they would participate in her plan and it fell flat.  Don\u2019t just tell her know tell her h e l l no I\u2019m not changing my plans.  We\u2019re doing us.  You go do you.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad has already told your cousin 'no' to helping her, please do not allow this woman to go around him. HE ALREADY SAID NO.\n\nThe sheer effrontery of your cousin.... you should count yourself lucky that you don't live anywhere near her.", "NTA. How are you interfering? Those plans were already made and you haven\u2019t opened your mouth. She\u2019s the one interfering in your and your dad\u2019s plan because she didn\u2019t plan properly.", "Nta", "NTA.  Your cousin is an adult who can go without needing someone to hold her hand.  She and your aunt have no right to demand anything or blame you for anything.  Personally I would block them and go no contact.", "No is a complete sentence.   Tell your cousin that your dad is spending a week with you and your family and you will see her at the wedding.   Anything nasty she says, turn it right back around and repeat other.", "NTA, she assumed and guess what assuming makes of you?\n\n She is acting highly entitled and she should have asked your Dad his plans first. She isn't even being asked to make the whole journey by herself, just half. Even if it was the whole journey, still wouldn't make you or your dad the asshole simply because she didn't ASK. Your aunt can take a hike.\n\nWhat does your dad say about her asking this?", "NTA.  She wanted him to be a free babysitter. Sorry. She shouldn't have made assumptions. Nor should she try and use you as a free hotel.", "NTA, you deserve time with your dad without being responsible for a guest.  Your aunt can step in and help her daughter vs dumping it on her brother.  That part is a little weird - your daughter is travelling with her newborn and rather than help her out, the aunt has her brother do it (OP's father).", "NTA. I frequently traveled with a one year old solo. Is it difficult? Yes. Impossible? No. \n\nYou\u2019re not responsible for her lack of planning and neither is your father. She has a husband who should be the one to help. Or she could use this as practice to travel on her own with the toddler", "Absolutely positively NTA. Faith should\u2019ve been upfront about her plans and intentions with your dad from the start. That\u2019s her fault, not yours! \n\nNeither you nor your dad are obligated to change plans or accommodate hers, especially if neither of you were aware of her \u201cneed\u201d from the start.", "NTA. They made an assumption that your Dad would fit in with their plans. He made his own plans. He has a right to stick to those plans. You are NTA for being happy your Dad chose to stick to the plan of visiting you.", "NTA, what an entitled pair. Does your dad know they\u2019re harassing you? Yes, traveling with babies and small kids is hard, but that doesn\u2019t make it everyone else\u2019s problem to solve.", "Noooo, don't let her take advantage of your dad! She has a husband and a flying mother. Not your issue. Your dad deserves bonding time with your kids. NTA", "# Hi Faith, Thank you for checking in with me but unfortunately Dad and I have fixed plans during his visit and I cannot accommodate any other guests. He mentioned to me that he can meet you at point B on xx date so you can travel the last leg to Ray's wedding together. Have a great time at Ray's wedding and maybe we can catch up some other time. Also please let your mum know that we cannot change the plans we made or add anyone to our itinerary. \n\n# Hugs xx, \n\n# OP and OP's Dad. \n\nWhy can't she travel with baby alone? Millions of people travel with kids.. I did and so did my husband separately from me.. I once did a multi - country month long trip with a 7 month old alone.. Husband traveled with two under 5 to Europe for a month as well.
