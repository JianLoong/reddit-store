She has a spouse and a second parent for her child.

Your dad has offered a reasonable solution, especially since it doesn't seem like he was asked if he would be willing to help. Surely your cousin can handle 1 leg of the trip on her own.", "NTA. It's completely reasonable for you to want quality time with your dad without having to take on the responsibility of hosting a guest and their baby. Your cousin should have asked your dad about his plans before assuming she could tag along. It's important to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs.", "NTA\n\nShe's not that special that you and your dad have to cancel your own plans just to accommodate her.\n\nShe cannot expect that everyone will drop everything to help her out - and then to react that aggressive is simply the icing on the cake.", "NTA. You dad should not have to give up a visit with his family.  It would be nice to invite her if you could but if that\u2019s not possible, she\u2019s an adult and will have to figure it out on her own. Maybe bring a friend with her to help her with the baby on the flights.", "NTA. Also I know 1 year olds are hard but plenty of people solo travel with their 1 y/o, it\u2019s hard but not impossible.

Anything nasty she says, turn it right back around and repeat other.", "NTA, she assumed and guess what assuming makes of you?\n\n She is acting highly entitled and she should have asked your Dad his plans first. She isn't even being asked to make the whole journey by herself, just half. Even if it was the whole journey, still wouldn't make you or your dad the asshole simply because she didn't ASK. Your aunt can take a hike.\n\nWhat does your dad say about her asking this?", "NTA.  She wanted him to be a free babysitter. Sorry. She shouldn't have made assumptions. Nor should she try and use you as a free hotel.", "NTA, you deserve time with your dad without being responsible for a guest.

I frequently traveled with a one year old solo. Is it difficult? Yes. Impossible? No. \n\nYou\u2019re not responsible for her lack of planning and neither is your father.

Also please let your mum know that we cannot change the plans we made or add anyone to our itinerary. \n\n# Hugs xx, \n\n# OP and OP's Dad. \n\nWhy can't she travel with baby alone?
