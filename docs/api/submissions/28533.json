{"id": 28533, "submission_id": "173ish5", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay my MIL?", "selftext": "I (F31) gave birth to my beautiful son a week ago. Unfortunately there were some complications, so I was only released yesterday but I am so grateful to be home with our baby boy. When my waters initially broke, my husband (M33) and I were at home and I happened to be standing on my bedroom carpet. Cleaning was obviously not the priority, so I threw some towels down and we left for the hospital.\r  \n\r  \nDuring the time we were in hospital, my MIL (F59) kindly offered to feed our dogs for us, and we were very appreciative of her help. It was only once we get home yesterday that I saw my MIL had left a receipt and note stuck to the fridge, saying that she had cleaned my bedroom carpet and wanted to be reimbursed. She had also taken it upon herself to clean the rest of the house while she was at it, and all in all, would like a day's pay at $25/hour + $200 worth of products.\r  \n\r  \nNow, while it was nice of her to clean my carpet and then the rest of my house, neither of us asked her to do this. My husband wrote her the following text:\r  \n\r  \n\"Hello mom, we really appreciate your help over the last few days while (my name) was in the hospital. It was great having someone over to look after the dogs.\r  \n\r  \nWe noticed your note and receipt on the fridge, and are a little upset you took it upon yourself to 1. snoop through the house, as neither of us had told you about (my name's) water's breaking in the bedroom, 2. go out and buy hundreds of dollars worth of cleaning products, and then 3. charging us for your time and the aforementioned products. We would also like to ask where these cleaning products are, as if we are paying for them, we would certainly like to get our money's worth\r  \n\r  \nWhen we entrusted you with the dogs, we really thought you were helping us out of the good of your heart and not giving you an opportunity to make a quick buck. We are family, and are hurt you would do something like this while (my name) was so unwell.\"\r  \n\r  \nMy MIL immediately responded to my husband saying that she did what she did out of the kindness of her heart, and she cannot believe we would be so ungrateful. I have also recieved some texts from extended family members saying that MIL didn't have to help me, but did do despite \"her advanced age\" out of love. I have had to turn off my phone so that I don't have to deal with all the texts, but my husband is still getting a lot of hate from his family because we are \"mainpulating the situation\" and making MIL the bad guy when she was only trying to get the house ready for the baby.\r  \n\r  \nI am quite upset by the whole thing, but my husband is now saying that maybe we should pay to get the extended family off our back and just enjoy this time as new parents rather than dealing with all this. I am not okay with paying him mom for anything! She sent another text to my husband earlier saying she would be happy to gift us the products (i.e. take it off our bill), but she would still like to be paid for her time given that she dealt with \"a biohazard.\"", "created_utc": 1696824685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173ish5/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_mil/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Husband said that she pushed him to come stay for two weeks so she could help  take care of things, so he was pissed that she expected me to do anything.", "We were living with my ma when I had our 1st baby, he came very early and 1 of the 1st things she did (once we knew he was ok) was go out and buy a load of premmie sleepsuits (still remember seeing the photo of them hanging on the washing line after she washed them before 1st use, it was so sweet!) and lots of premmie nappies, got all the bottles (that we had bought shortly before) sterilised etc! And clean the landing carpet where my waters broke! OPs mil also baffles me!", "\u201cIt would very have crossed my mind to ask for compensation or ask to be paid for the food I purchased.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure you meant \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have crossed my mind to ask for compensation or ask to be paid for the food I purchased.\u201d", "It\u2019s like those guys that start cleaning your windshield and then expect to be paid. I didn\u2019t ask for or want your service. No.", "Since she obviously has a key, i would change the locks.", "Heh, they should charge MIL to see the baby... What a ridiculous woman.", "FTFY\n\nyou will never be alone with our child because we can't trust you not to send us a bill for babysitting and expenses afterward.", "They can\u2019t leave them. She took them already./", "She didn't even leave the cleaning products! OP's husband's text to the old bat says if she wants paying for the cleaning products, then they should have the cleaning products.", "I like this.", "Yep this!\n\nYou are 100% NTA but I would pay her and create distance. Set some boundaries because this is only going to get worse", "Fluids are colorless, so what would have caused a stain?", "59 is hardly old and infirm. I am 64 and I just did a 5k, watched my grandkids, and cleaned my daughter's house. (I didn't charge her either).", "> NTA and I'd still pay it anyway just to shut her and everyone else up.\n\nBlocking is easier.  And you don't have to put up with more antics.", "Absofuckingloutly.", "Second this!  Change locks immediately!!!", "Uhhhh\u2026..very often, when a lady\u2019s \u201cwater breaks\u201d, it\u2019s not clear. And trust me, after a few hours of having that sitting in the carpet, that carpet stank", "Oh, I agree. I was basing that on the comments by the family mentioning her age. I'm older than both of you and wouldn't have a problem cleaning, but their family is implying that the cleaning was a hardship because of her age.", "Gotcha!"]}
