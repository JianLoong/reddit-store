I try to do so earlier on in the season or when there are sales, that way I dont scramble the last minute.\n\nThis year me and the hubby did not have a lot of money but wanted to get my mother something she really wanted- that is a dolce and cabana perfume, about 50$ and some lotions.

She wants us to get my mother face wipes and chocolate, which is not personal gift in my opinion. I told her that we don't have the funds to pay for both the perfume and the other gifts. I offered to send back our perfume but not to pay for hers. Since we were going to use our refund for another gift and it wasn't going to be one she picked out. She wasn't happy with that. So I offered another solution. I asked her politely to cancel her order since she just ordered it online that moment and we bought ours over a month ago. She can use the funds if she wants to get those things for her. She then began to really get upset with me and told me, \"Now moms not going to get what she wants\".

However we prepared a long time ago and everything is here and wrapped already. And there is only 10 days left to get another gift from us. When I offered different solutions non of them worked for her. It is unfortunate that she ended up with the same gift and we could help her out. However I feel like its not fair for us to go out of our way and pay more than we already did. It would be a lot more work on us than for her to just cancel an item.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
