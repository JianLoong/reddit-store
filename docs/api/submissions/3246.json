I share a daughter Annie (9F) with my current husband Bruce (46M).  \n\nMarco and Bruce are night and day different. Marco works in construction, plays softball on the weekends, and coaches my daughter's soccer team. Bruce teaches at a university, plays the piano, likes going to the theater, and is an amazing baker and cook.  \n\nIt's not uncommon that we will go to one of Pam's soccer games, and then afterwards, the whole team comes back to the house to enjoy cookies or cupcakes made by Bruce. At the end of the season, we do a big dinner for the team and their parents that Bruce cooks.  \n\nBruce and I have been married for 11 years and every year for the kids' birthdays, he makes the most incredible cakes. Whatever they like that year, he does. We've had Pok\u00e9mon, Doc McStuffins, Paw Patrol, among others.  \n\nFebruary is Pam's 16th birthday. Her sweet sixteen. Bruce has been planning this gorgeous cake that encompasses all of Pam's interests and different stages of her life.  \n\nThe other day another mom sent me a link to a TikTok that Pam and several of her teammates did. It uses audio from an episode of Family Guy. It's a video of Bruce taking a cake out of the oven with \"Chocolate cake, a la Blake,\" playing in the background, followed by a cut to my daughter and her teammates with Pam holding up her hand and mouthing along to, \"Hundred bucks, Blake is gay,\" out of the side of her mouth.  \n\nWhen I confronted Pam, she said it was just a joke. I told her that it wasn't funny, Bruce saw her and treated her like his daughter, and it was disrespectful to both of us. She told me that I was overreacting. \n\nI told her that if she didn't take it down, and apologize to Bruce, I'd tell him not to make her a birthday cake. She rolled her eyes and said that she'd take it down.  \n\nShortly after I was walking by her room and heard her on the phone. It was muffled but I heard her talk about me being dramatic over my f-word husband.  \n\nI ordered her to hang up the phone. She hung up and said she was just blowing off steam. I called her a spoiled ungrateful brat and how dare she use that word. She started crying and said she didn't mean it. I told her that her birthday party is canceled, there will be no sweet sixteen, and that I was going to tell Bruce to stop baking for the team and that we would never do a team dinner again.  \n\nI am still so angry. Marco told me that I need to let it go, that I'm expecting too much from a teenager, and that he would have a party for her if I didn't. Bruce was hurt when he found out but thinks that we should still let her have her party. My sister tells me not to doubt myself and I made the right call, but I wonder if I'm acting with too much hot blood.  \n\nEdit: The f-word I am referring to is a slur for gay men.  \n\nEdit 2: Forgot a word above so I edited. Also, to clarify, I did not punish her for the TikTok video, as much as it irritated me. I told her to take it down and apologize to Bruce or there would be no birthday cake. She agreed to take it down. The punishment came when I heard her refer to Bruce as my f----t husband. I did not raise her to be a homophobe, to use that word, or to disrespect anyone in her life.

I'd say don't cancel the party but definitely have them sit down and talk things out.

Teens are difficult, sometimes disrespectful, and stupid, but accountability is what makes them into productive members of society rather than entitled adults that lack respect, compassion, and empathy. Now with that said, sixteen is a big deal and if you can find a suitable punishment that satisfies everyone involved, holds her accountable, and allows her to have her party, I\u2019d consider changing your mind. Self reflection and some sort humbling experience usually does the trick. I hope your family can find resolve, because what she did was disrespectful, but there can be accountability without canceling her party. If not, then it is what has to be.", "NTA.

Hardly deserves sweets from such a sweet man.  \n\nBut, and hear me out. Birthdays only happen once. Doubly so for mile stone birthdays. \n\nI'd highly recommend a sincere written apology. Personally, I'd let the birthday happen but would bring down hell on her after.

I would be so disgusted that a child I raised could behave in such a way. This is something that should not be tolerated on any level against anyone. That she is ridiculing a family member is much worse. She needs to know that this hate speech is not tolerated anywhere. She could get expelled, lose her job, etc. She needs sensitivity training. I would do something so that she knows the severity of what she is doing.", "NTA. Out of curiosity, is Marco someone she might be learning these slurs from? Is that why he thinks you are being too harsh?\n\nYou need to sit down and have a strong conversation with your daughter about how being gay is nothing to be ashamed of, even though Bruce isn't.

She needs to learn that it\u2019s not ok. After you confronted her she still continued to dig herself into a deeper hole. Don\u2019t reward bad behavior-you won\u2019t be doing her any favors by continuing with her party or her team. \n\nYour ex saying he will throw her a party is a problem too. Yes, she\u2019s a teenager but she\u2019s old enough to know right from wrong as well. A simple I\u2019m sorry isn\u2019t going to magically fix this and make it okay.", "NTA.
