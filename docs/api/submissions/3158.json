I\u2019m sure there was a manager override or something to make things right.", "NTA and don't overthink it.  In that kind of shop there will always be a few sandwiches which get made but don't get purchased.  In this particular franchise their obstinance probably causes it to happen quite often.", "NTA.  You went to the shop with good intention and you brought the voucher.  The shop owner didn't honor the voucher - so leave!  You didn't touch or bite into the sandwiches, so why can't the sandwiches at least be given to the employees?", "NTA and you should probably post a review letting people know that he\u2019s trying this scam.", "NTA.

Retail workers obviously deserve the grace you're extending but a franchise owner is not a retail customer service worker. He probably has never made a sandwich in that shop, ever. It was his employee's fault in the first place the voucher wasn't activated correctly, therefore he is the one who has to eat that loss. Also, the employee who made the sandwiches probably got to eat them/take them home.", "the gift card isn\u2019t for me it\u2019s part of my dad\u2019s Christmas gift because he for some reason loves this chain. I was going to get them regardless but the promotion was just a bonus", "If you eat there anyway you're going to spend the money there anyway. I often load up on gift cards around Christmas.

If it\u2019s a country wide promotion then that\u2019s something corporate is running. He may actually not literally have the power to do anything, he doesn\u2019t have a choice about the promotions at all and actually loses money on them because corporate usually does not reimburse those and they may not even get full value on gift cards (depending on when the franchise agreement went into effect and what country this is). \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you wanting what you paid for and were promised but you should just send a complaint to corporate", "THIS exactly. Our local owner of this franchise chain had to put up a sign that they cannot honor ANY coupons at this time.

It's so weird", "The whole point of promotions is encouraging people who would not otherwise make a purchase, it's not 'disrespectful' to make a decision to go somewhere based on a promotion.

They have a thing (or did, if not anymore) with their app where if you scan so many receipts, you get a free buffet or large pizza. Did that and redeemed my eight \"punches\" for the free buffet code. Tell the cashier who then called the manager over as apparently she didn't know what to do with it (which was my \"*sighs* Ah, crap\" moment). \n\nThe manager promptly refuses to honor the redemption, just saying I had to get the eight punches first. I tried explaining to her several times that yes, you get the code once the eight punches are redeemed. That that's *literally how you get the code on their app for the offer*. \n\nShe kept denying it and I just gave up and said forget it. Had I not been with people who were my ride, there would have been a good chance I'd have just left.\n\nLater, just out of curiosity, I looked up reviews for the place.
