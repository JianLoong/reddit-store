{"id": 14364, "submission_id": "12gi5gu", "title": "AITA for causing family drama by going over my uncle's head to a judge for permission to marry?", "selftext": "My (27f) father passed away a few years ago. Before he passed away he divided all his assets between me, my sister and my mother. This was mainly because I don't have a brother, and because my country practices Shariah law when it comes to family, inheritance and marriage a part of his assets would also go to my uncle (because my grandparents had already passed away when I was young). This became an issue because my uncle felt cheated out of his inheritance from my dad. \n\nI don't understand this mentality because in my country it is very common, even for people who don't have a lot of assets to divide it among their daughters while they are still alive if they don't have sons. So I don't really get why my uncle is upset. This is very common practice. \n\nMy uncle being mad at me wouldn't have been an issue if he wasn't my wali. In Islam a wali is a legal guardian. Generally a woman's wali would be her father, but in the absence of her father it would be her brother. If she doesn't have a brother it would be her paternal grandfather, and if not it would be her paternal uncle, which was my case. \n\nAnd when I wanted to get married last year, I needed my uncle's permission because a Muslim woman getting married without permission from her wali is not legally or religiously permissible here.\n\nMy uncle was still upset about the whole inheritance thing so he told me he'd give me permission if I paid him a certain amount of money. I was fairly upset over this so I decided to go for the nuclear option (in terms of family drama, at least). I went to court and got permission to marry from the qadi (judge in an Islamic court) instead. \n\nThis upset basically everyone. I was \"airing\" family drama in public by going through the courts instead of just paying my uncle, especially when I could afford what he was asking for. Everyone I invited to my wedding ceremony would have known something was wrong because my uncle wasn't in attendance. \n\nMy uncle still doesn't speak to me over this, and in hindsight, my life would've been easier if I had just paid him. If I decide to let it go and just give my uncle the money as a peace offering it would also make my dad's side of the family be kinder to my mother.", "created_utc": 1681043531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gi5gu/aita_for_causing_family_drama_by_going_over_my/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA for going to a judge. Your uncle actually disqualified as a wali (because he denied your marriage without a legitimate reason and tried to blackmail you) and according to shariah, you had every right to turn to a judge. And it is obvious the judge thought so too. \n\nAs for the inheritance, your uncle had a right to it and your father divided his assets before his death so that you, his children and wife, wouldn't miss out on it if it all went to his brother. Some would say that was not right for your father to do. However, let us be pragmatic and realistic and not live in a theoretical world. The reason why your uncle would've inherited from your father in the first place is because according to shariah he is obligated to provide for you. Is he doing that? Would he do it? So you would've been left with no to little financial assets and have, with most likelihood, no to little financial support from your uncle or extended male relatives. That is probably why your father wanted to make sure that the people he loves would be provided for after he was gone. And because of this, I still think NTA. Even by taking into account the religious/cultural aspects. \n\nIn both cases you did nothing wrong. Do not let people bully you into thinking that you should cater to other people's needs and wants while they would most definitely NOT do the same for you. Your uncle has already proven by denying your marriage and basically forcing you to go to a judge that he does not look out for your best interests. \n\nPeople will walk all over you and treat you badly as long as they feel they can threaten and behave however they want without consequences. As the saying goes. Your uncle f***** around and found out and now he's mad.\n\nEdit: 1st paragraph add", "NTA\n\n(With some caveats)\n\nThe caveats rest on the socio-cultural aspects of your environment.\n\nI agree with your decision to bypass your uncle and would have probably done the same. However, in your society or culture, going to court will surely be seen as a breach of family loyalty and may have created additional tensions and conflicts within your family.\r  \n\r  \nDepending on your, your family's, religiosity levels, it's also important to acknowledge that the concept of a wali in Islam is a significant one, and your uncle may have felt that his authority as your wali was being challenged. However, a wali is not to act as a gatekeeper to prevent women from marrying, but rather to ensure that the marriage is conducted in a way that is consistent with Islamic teachings and is in the best interest of the woman.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, it's up to you to decide how to proceed. If you feel that giving your uncle the money he requested would help to repair the relationship and bring peace to your family, then that may be a viable option. On the other hand, if you feel that doing so would compromise your values or send the message that you are willing to be coerced, then you may want to consider other ways to reconcile with your uncle and family.", "He\u2019s a greedy asshole if a lump sum was what it took to give you \u201cpermission\u201d that you don\u2019t actually require.\n\nDoes your mother live with them; why is she having to tolerate poor treatment by her deceased spouses extended family?\n\nAll in all, NTA for not allowing outdated cultural norms to stifle your life.

It might be so intense that this wasn\u2019t the *wisest* decision, but it wasn\u2019t an asshole one.\n\nI do want to point out there\u2019s a reason there\u2019s an option for you to seek a qadi, and the reason the qadi approved. It\u2019s for men like your uncle who fail in their duty, and the qadi saw that.", "seems to me op followed the spirit of her cultural standards, while the uncle thought he could take advantage of the letter. nta, and congrats!", "This is the most accurate explanation. The religious laws are there as guidance. But there are safeguards to avoid people being taken advantage of. Hence it is totally allowed for your father to have divided his assets and totally right for you to seek a Judge/court wali. NTA.", "Spot on! I\u2019m a Muslim living in Pakistan and I cannot agree with this more!\n\nThe only reason uncle gets inheritance is to provide for OP and her family, the same reason a son gets twice the inheritance compared to daughters.\n\nShe did nothing wrong going to a judge, because a wali has a duty which the uncle failed to fulfil, and if the wali is not performing his duty, OP Islamically has the right to take it to a judge for them to act as wali. \n\nNTA OP!", "Yup, when I was a minor, my parents\u2019 wills reflected the more traditional distribution because my uncle would have had to take us kids into his household and pay for our care/needs. When we were older, they switched it to the money going to us. My parents figured that we\u2019d be living independently at that point and the purpose of leaving some money to a male relative was now moot.", "Even without the western perspective, the uncle was failing to live up to his cultural and religious obligations, and that's why a court intervened to remove his say over the matter.", "Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s an asshole from a Muslim western perspective too. They can be all in a miff that the dad didn\u2019t follow the standard inheritance laws, but the will was executed and he should not have extorted his own niece.  The court wouldn\u2019t have supported her otherwise.", "She's NTA from a middle eastern perspective either. Her uncle held up her future due to some petty bs.", "I'm glad this is being pointed out more often on this site; I'm sick of seeing American teenagers and neckbeards looking at everything through their cultural lens.", "Nah, its just a backwards superstition based on no evidence, reason or facts that actively opresses women and sexual and gender minorities. As well as used as an excuse for racial bigoty and supremacy.", "Some other people make good points that the uncle could arguably still be TA even within their culture. If the uncle were following shariah law properly the judge wouldn\u2019t have ruled against him, for one.", "I don't see a lot of cultural ambiguity here. Dad did what dad wanted with dad's money.  \n\n\nUncle doesn't respect that, wants dad's money for himself.  \n\n\nUncle tries to extort daughter.  \n\n\nIf anything, this base display of selfishness is a reminder of how very much alike we all are.", "It is black and white, having women treated as lesser than men and unable to choose their own marriage is not okay, it's morally wrong. I don't care about your culture or religious beliefs unless someone does not get to consent to something. That is not a belief at that point anymore if it's forced. \n\nGranted, I fully recgonize that this isn't something that can change overnight, but we still should be fighting for it.", "Cultural relativism is for food, not women\u2019s rights.", " Unless OPs father was sick and being cared for solely by OP inheritance is a gift but not exactly hard earned.", "Because it is a black and white issue.", "Unfortunately for you its a cultural lens that is ant-iracist, anti-sexist, meritocratic, anti-slavery, pro-lgbtq rights and supports legal systems based around secular, just, legal decisons and laws as well as democratic anti-tyranical governments. Yeah, those are all just horrible cultural norm/s. The reat of world is so much better without them/s. This is clearly evident in the rest of the worlds economic prosperity, technological advancement and politcal stability/s. Oh wait...", "Stealing an orphan\u2019s inheritance is a major sin so he\u2019s in the wrong either way for:\n\n1) Trying to steal\n2) Blackmailing you\n\nPretty sure they are both huge sins in your religion.  If you pay him, you will end up legitimising his actions", "He is the asshole under our culture. He abused his position as wali outright.", "If it would make life easier and you can easily afford it,  then do it.  But be prepared that he may come back for more.  But I wouldn't do it 100% respectfully.  Act like it is an act of pity. (Since you would never want to distress your family and worry about your uncle since he is so destitute that he had to blackmail his own niece.) Do what will make your life better and by extension- your mother's life.  I'm sorry you have to deal with this.", "Some other people make good points that the uncle could arguably still be TA even within their culture.", "Sharia court is a court of religion law. The court is not a separate entity like in the US.", "The court is a religious court. The government is a religious government. There *is* no separation of religion and state in OP\u2019s country.", "Evidently a judge in their culture agreed.", "Legal misogyny has been the norm the world over at different points in history regardless of location. That aside, please explain how women being denied the same rights as men is acceptable in certain circumstances and something that should be respected. Explain how legalized misogyny is not black and white.", "If you feel like there are some good moral arguments for keeping women second class citizens, feel free to make those arguments.", "No, but misogyny and sexism will always me immoral, doesn't matter the surroundings or culture. Fuck sharia law, fuck those islamic traditions, fuck this uncle and any other man perpetrating these \"values\".", "Well.. look around the world and you realise that is actually the case.", "Nope, this has nothing to do with western countries and their sins. This is blatant misogyny, and it\u2019s morally repugnant full stop. Anyone who finds that statement offensive to their culture needs to reevaluate their culture.", "Yes, follow the religion, or flee in the night. A woman defying the laws laid out by religion makes her a criminal. The law is unkind to criminals, especially defiant women."]}
