{"id": 14364, "submission_id": "12gi5gu", "title": "AITA for causing family drama by going over my uncle's head to a judge for permission to marry?", "selftext": "My (27f) father passed away a few years ago. Before he passed away he divided all his assets between me, my sister and my mother. This was mainly because I don't have a brother, and because my country practices Shariah law when it comes to family, inheritance and marriage a part of his assets would also go to my uncle (because my grandparents had already passed away when I was young). This became an issue because my uncle felt cheated out of his inheritance from my dad. \n\nI don't understand this mentality because in my country it is very common, even for people who don't have a lot of assets to divide it among their daughters while they are still alive if they don't have sons. So I don't really get why my uncle is upset. This is very common practice. \n\nMy uncle being mad at me wouldn't have been an issue if he wasn't my wali. In Islam a wali is a legal guardian. Generally a woman's wali would be her father, but in the absence of her father it would be her brother. If she doesn't have a brother it would be her paternal grandfather, and if not it would be her paternal uncle, which was my case. \n\nAnd when I wanted to get married last year, I needed my uncle's permission because a Muslim woman getting married without permission from her wali is not legally or religiously permissible here.\n\nMy uncle was still upset about the whole inheritance thing so he told me he'd give me permission if I paid him a certain amount of money. I was fairly upset over this so I decided to go for the nuclear option (in terms of family drama, at least). I went to court and got permission to marry from the qadi (judge in an Islamic court) instead. \n\nThis upset basically everyone. I was \"airing\" family drama in public by going through the courts instead of just paying my uncle, especially when I could afford what he was asking for. Everyone I invited to my wedding ceremony would have known something was wrong because my uncle wasn't in attendance. \n\nMy uncle still doesn't speak to me over this, and in hindsight, my life would've been easier if I had just paid him. If I decide to let it go and just give my uncle the money as a peace offering it would also make my dad's side of the family be kinder to my mother.", "created_utc": 1681043531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gi5gu/aita_for_causing_family_drama_by_going_over_my/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can go screw himself.  It sounds like your mom is under your uncle\u2019s thumb unfortunately. Hopefully you can get her and any siblings you have out of that situation.", "Your uncle basically was blackmailing you, instead of looking out for your well being in respect to your potential husband (assuming this is spirit of wali law)-nta.

NTA for going to a judge. Your uncle actually disqualified as a wali (because he denied your marriage without a legitimate reason and tried to blackmail you) and according to shariah, you had every right to turn to a judge. And it is obvious the judge thought so too. \n\nAs for the inheritance, your uncle had a right to it and your father divided his assets before his death so that you, his children and wife, wouldn't miss out on it if it all went to his brother. Some would say that was not right for your father to do. However, let us be pragmatic and realistic and not live in a theoretical world. The reason why your uncle would've inherited from your father in the first place is because according to shariah he is obligated to provide for you. Is he doing that? Would he do it? So you would've been left with no to little financial assets and have, with most likelihood, no to little financial support from your uncle or extended male relatives. That is probably why your father wanted to make sure that the people he loves would be provided for after he was gone. And because of this, I still think NTA. Even by taking into account the religious/cultural aspects. \n\nIn both cases you did nothing wrong. Do not let people bully you into thinking that you should cater to other people's needs and wants while they would most definitely NOT do the same for you. Your uncle has already proven by denying your marriage and basically forcing you to go to a judge that he does not look out for your best interests. \n\nPeople will walk all over you and treat you badly as long as they feel they can threaten and behave however they want without consequences. As the saying goes. Your uncle f***** around and found out and now he's mad.\n\nEdit: 1st paragraph add", "NTA\n\n(With some caveats)\n\nThe caveats rest on the socio-cultural aspects of your environment.\n\nI agree with your decision to bypass your uncle and would have probably done the same. However, in your society or culture, going to court will surely be seen as a breach of family loyalty and may have created additional tensions and conflicts within your family.\r  \n\r  \nDepending on your, your family's, religiosity levels, it's also important to acknowledge that the concept of a wali in Islam is a significant one, and your uncle may have felt that his authority as your wali was being challenged. However, a wali is not to act as a gatekeeper to prevent women from marrying, but rather to ensure that the marriage is conducted in a way that is consistent with Islamic teachings and is in the best interest of the woman.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, it's up to you to decide how to proceed. If you feel that giving your uncle the money he requested would help to repair the relationship and bring peace to your family, then that may be a viable option. On the other hand, if you feel that doing so would compromise your values or send the message that you are willing to be coerced, then you may want to consider other ways to reconcile with your uncle and family.", "He\u2019s a greedy asshole if a lump sum was what it took to give you \u201cpermission\u201d that you don\u2019t actually require.\n\nDoes your mother live with them; why is she having to tolerate poor treatment by her deceased spouses extended family?\n\nAll in all, NTA for not allowing outdated cultural norms to stifle your life.
