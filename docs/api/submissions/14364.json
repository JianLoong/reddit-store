{"id": 14364, "submission_id": "12gi5gu", "title": "AITA for causing family drama by going over my uncle's head to a judge for permission to marry?", "selftext": "My (27f) father passed away a few years ago. Before he passed away he divided all his assets between me, my sister and my mother. This was mainly because I don't have a brother, and because my country practices Shariah law when it comes to family, inheritance and marriage a part of his assets would also go to my uncle (because my grandparents had already passed away when I was young). This became an issue because my uncle felt cheated out of his inheritance from my dad. \n\nI don't understand this mentality because in my country it is very common, even for people who don't have a lot of assets to divide it among their daughters while they are still alive if they don't have sons. So I don't really get why my uncle is upset. This is very common practice. \n\nMy uncle being mad at me wouldn't have been an issue if he wasn't my wali. In Islam a wali is a legal guardian. Generally a woman's wali would be her father, but in the absence of her father it would be her brother. If she doesn't have a brother it would be her paternal grandfather, and if not it would be her paternal uncle, which was my case. \n\nAnd when I wanted to get married last year, I needed my uncle's permission because a Muslim woman getting married without permission from her wali is not legally or religiously permissible here.\n\nMy uncle was still upset about the whole inheritance thing so he told me he'd give me permission if I paid him a certain amount of money. I was fairly upset over this so I decided to go for the nuclear option (in terms of family drama, at least). I went to court and got permission to marry from the qadi (judge in an Islamic court) instead. \n\nThis upset basically everyone. I was \"airing\" family drama in public by going through the courts instead of just paying my uncle, especially when I could afford what he was asking for. Everyone I invited to my wedding ceremony would have known something was wrong because my uncle wasn't in attendance. \n\nMy uncle still doesn't speak to me over this, and in hindsight, my life would've been easier if I had just paid him. If I decide to let it go and just give my uncle the money as a peace offering it would also make my dad's side of the family be kinder to my mother.", "created_utc": 1681043531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gi5gu/aita_for_causing_family_drama_by_going_over_my/", "score": 779, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA for going to a judge. Your uncle actually disqualified as a wali (because he denied your marriage without a legitimate reason and tried to blackmail you) and according to shariah, you had every right to turn to a judge. And it is obvious the judge thought so too. \n\nAs for the inheritance, your uncle had a right to it and your father divided his assets before his death so that you, his children and wife, wouldn't miss out on it if it all went to his brother. Some would say that was not right for your father to do. However, let us be pragmatic and realistic and not live in a theoretical world. The reason why your uncle would've inherited from your father in the first place is because according to shariah he is obligated to provide for you. Is he doing that? Would he do it? So you would've been left with no to little financial assets and have, with most likelihood, no to little financial support from your uncle or extended male relatives. That is probably why your father wanted to make sure that the people he loves would be provided for after he was gone. And because of this, I still think NTA. Even by taking into account the religious/cultural aspects. \n\nIn both cases you did nothing wrong. Do not let people bully you into thinking that you should cater to other people's needs and wants while they would most definitely NOT do the same for you. Your uncle has already proven by denying your marriage and basically forcing you to go to a judge that he does not look out for your best interests. \n\nPeople will walk all over you and treat you badly as long as they feel they can threaten and behave however they want without consequences.

Your uncle f***** around and found out and now he's mad.\n\nEdit: 1st paragraph add", "NTA\n\n(With some caveats)\n\nThe caveats rest on the socio-cultural aspects of your environment.\n\nI agree with your decision to bypass your uncle and would have probably done the same. However, in your society or culture, going to court will surely be seen as a breach of family loyalty and may have created additional tensions and conflicts within your family.\r  \n\r  \nDepending on your, your family's, religiosity levels, it's also important to acknowledge that the concept of a wali in Islam is a significant one, and your uncle may have felt that his authority as your wali was being challenged. However, a wali is not to act as a gatekeeper to prevent women from marrying, but rather to ensure that the marriage is conducted in a way that is consistent with Islamic teachings and is in the best interest of the woman.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, it's up to you to decide how to proceed. If you feel that giving your uncle the money he requested would help to repair the relationship and bring peace to your family, then that may be a viable option. On the other hand, if you feel that doing so would compromise your values or send the message that you are willing to be coerced, then you may want to consider other ways to reconcile with your uncle and family.", "He\u2019s a greedy asshole if a lump sum was what it took to give you \u201cpermission\u201d that you don\u2019t actually require.\n\nDoes your mother live with them; why is she having to tolerate poor treatment by her deceased spouses extended family?\n\nAll in all, NTA for not allowing outdated cultural norms to stifle your life.

Our uncle tried to berate, bully persuade and coerce my female cousin into giving up her inheritance to him.

If my husband butts in everyone would be like why are you letting him dictate what to do with your money lol", "Uncles is definitely the AH in Islam.", "As a muslim, I can say he is an AH who is just being petty.", "[Bot](https://old.reddit.com/user/Superqwsfg) stole [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gi5gu/aita_for_causing_family_drama_by_going_over_my/jfkly46/)", "But they aren\u2019t voluntarily followed. They\u2019re imposed by the state.", "That's fair. I was just thinking that if your uncle believes he can control your money/make demands because he's \"in charge\" and the reason he's in charge of you and not your sister is because she's married then maybe it would appeal to his beliefs if your husband was the one putting his foot down instead of you.\n\nI think NTA here. But like someone else said, different culture so it's only from that perspective", "bot", "Not in the hypothetical I posed, thats why I said \"thought exercise\"", "That uncle has nothing to do with our religion. U know nothing of sharia law. Dont use one man as an example of an entire religious sect.", "Dude, f off, I know a lot about Sharia law. It's not compatible with human rights. It's dehumanising and only good for those radical religious men. That man is a good example of those that believe in this system. It's shit. The people that practice it are shit. There needs to be a complete reform and people need to be freed of it.", "Bro the fact that a 27 year old woman requires a legal guardian is misogynistic as all hell. Sure, the uncles terrible for reasons outside of that, but defending a practice that makes an almost 30 year old woman have to ask her UNCLE for permission to marry is sketch as hell.", "The uncle's actions are possible because of a law that says women need permission to marry from a senior male relative. This used to be the case in Western Europe, but nowadays it is mostly found in countries where they practice Sharia law. So yes, this man hae everything to do with Sharia law, even if his actions do not bear out the ideals of the Islamic faith.", "The qadi said she could marry", "Sharia law wasnt made to be exploited by guys like that though m that's my point is that how the uncle is acting, it's wrong and a bad representation of our religion.", "Agreed. But Cassandra seems under the impression that the qadi is government, not church, and that one can disregard the church.", "Okay but thats not the issue, the issue is that a 27 year old woman has a legal guardian AT ALL", "She said she is in a country with Sharia law so\u2026 no. Cassandra is mistaken."]}
