I\u2019m an immigrant in this country and don\u2019t have any family here, just a few girlfriends that I met here. He has almost whole family here. We are from different cultures and religions, so from the first day I was very interested in his culture and attended almost all of his religious and cultural events, supported his traditions (like fasting for one of the holy days), attended all family events like birthdays and weddings, cooked and baked for a whole family when attended some of the events, etc. His culture and religion have dozens of holidays during the year, and my culture has only one. It's a big deal for my people and we start preparing for it almost a month prior, we have big festivals and spend that day with family. (This is as much of a big deal as Christmas). \n\nThe day before the actual holiday I invited my girlfriends, and we spent the whole evening doing some traditional stuff and eating traditional food. The day after that we were supposed to celebrate with my boyfriend (I invited his family but they never come). He came in the morning between some errands that he had, had lunch with me, took a nap, and then went to proceed with his errands. I told him that I am expecting him in the evening (because we talked about it before) and he said that he won't be able to make it because he has some stuff to do. I reminded him that this is the only important day in my culture and he said \u201csorry\u201d and left. I spent my evening watching some tv show and feeling very sad and lonely because I have no family here. He didn't even call or text me that evening (he usually calls every night before falling asleep), so it felt even more personal. Today he called and asked me if I want to come to his place to hang out together. I was very upset with him because he didn't even say \u201chappy holiday\u201d, or anything. So I texted him after that call, that I don't think that is fair that I was participating and showing so much interest in his culture when he completely ignores me on only one important day that I celebrate. So I won't be going to any of his family events from now on. He said that he didn't know anything about that day (I was talking for a month about it), so I could have just come to his place today with some traditional food instead of saying that I don't want to participate in any of his events from now on. I felt like it was not fair because it is not about eating food and staring at each other, he has no interest in it. \n\nSo AITA for being upset about it and refusing to show interest in his culture from now on?", "created_utc": 1679437409, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xwzdl/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_boyfriends/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think the cultural aspect is kinda irrelevant. You told him this was a very special day for you that you wanted to share with him.

Are there other red  flags you\u2019ve ignored?  He doesn\u2019t care about your culture and he doesn\u2019t care about you.  You can do better than this jerk.   Move on from him; you\u2019re too good for him.", "NTA - But if this is where you are after three years, it may be time to cut bait and go fish another lake.", "NTA, but I do think this sounds like a deal-breaker. If you are going to stay together,  you 'll only end up resentful if he continues to take no interest in important parts of your culture. Even stopping taking part in his seems more vengeful than a permanent fix.\n\nTell him again how hurt you were and how you absolutely did tell him about it.

He sounds like he's not really interested in any culture other than his own, and honestly that's his right.

I don't blame you. Cultural traditions and celebrations are as easy to share as they are to get used to, after all. And frankly, I'd explain that I never anticipated he would be uninterested in me beyond his romantic, self serving interests.\n\nNo one wants to assimilate and shed everything they are just to be in a relationship.

I'm Jewish. My ex is not, and not once in 4 years did he bother to learn how my holidays work. Always got dates wrong because he never got it through his head that they start at sunset.

I would be enthusiastic to learn about it... and he couldn't even be bothered to be there for the evening.  Why are you with him? He must have some redeeming qualities... are they worth being with such a self-centred and uncaring guy?\n\nNTA", "NTA, you should refuse to show interest in him at all.

I hope he can come around after you guys have a less heated discussion about what happened!", "NTA. You do things to celebrate the traditions that are important to him, even though they aren\u2019t your cultural traditions.
