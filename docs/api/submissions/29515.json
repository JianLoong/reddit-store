People often shift the blame onto others when they\u2019ve shown some form of ignorance like your groupmate did, which is why he\u2019s saying you \u201cshould\u2019ve\u201d been nicer (centering his own feelings) rather than acknowledging his mistake and apologizing to you and D.\n\nYou don\u2019t have anything to apologize for. I do understand D\u2019s concern about your groupmate being uncooperative, so if you feel it could be helpful, you could just give him a simple \u201csorry for laughing\u201d and move on. Just remember you would be doing it for YOUR benefit in the project rather than correcting any \u201cwrongs,\u201d which you didn\u2019t commit. :)", "NTA. He butted into your conversation to ask a question that's none of his business. He then tried to shame you both for not following his personal standards. And to top it all off, he was wrong anyway. \n\nYou had a natural reaction of laughing which is fine. You corrected him and moved on. He *should* be embarrassed and will hopefully take this away as a learning opportunity. \n\nYou don't have anything to apologize for. I think the way forward here is for you both to continue to work with him on the project in a collaborative and polite manner. If he refuses to work or pull his weight, that's his problem and something you should talk to your professor about if it comes to that.", "As a fellow Indian, NTA. \n\nI live in India and don't speak any of the South Indian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada etc) and I barely speak Hindi. I'd say I'm above average at English though. And I've only ever lived in the country!!! \n\nTo sum up, location is irrelevant, upbringing and education is most important. And people should mind their own business, especially if they're not educated themselves in what they're talking about, like in the case of your friend. \n\nDo not apologise, if he wants to keep the peace he can.", "Yeah you don\u2019t have to be nice to ignorant bigots.

Also it will put his own grade at risk if he tries to make things difficult with the project.", "NTA, he should have not made ridiculous and ignorant remarks.", "NTA. He made an ignorant, rude, and offensive statement and you corrected him. He got mad at you for laughing because he knows he was in the wrong but wanted to redirect the fault towards you as a way to save face and avoid any internal feelings of guilt. Don\u2019t humor people when they do this.", "NTA and should not apologies, he was were rude and when you corrected him he didn't apologise so neither should you.\n\nIf he ever apologise you should as well, but no need until then.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
