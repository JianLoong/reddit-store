Bc that's what you do when you don't know something and want to learn the answer. \n\nWhere it tips into arrogance is him immediately giving his reason for believing why they don't talk together in a shared Indian language-not only is he showing a lack of wanting to understand something he doesn't actually know the answer to, but he's pushing his own assumptions onto two ppl he knows nothing about, when there are actually a lot of reasons beside his own why they might not be speaking an Indian language: one or both of them could have been adopted by non-Indian parents who couldn't teach them the language, or they just preferred speaking in English in class bc that's what everyone else is speaking, or maybe they nornally speak in a different language and want to strengthen their English. \n\nIgnorance is a lack of knowledge or information, whichg is where his question originated from.
