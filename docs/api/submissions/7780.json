{"id": 7780, "submission_id": "10ghzv7", "title": "AITA for not taking my daughters when my ex gave birth?", "selftext": "My ex-wife (Emma) and my wife (Lara) were pregnant around the same time. Lara was about 10 weeks ahead of Emma. In November, Lara gave birth to our son a few days after his due date. Three days after he and Lara came home, I received a panicked call from my SIL asking if I could take my daughters (9F twins) as Emma had been taken to hospital the night before and was being taken for a c-section. SIL and my brother had taken the girls in overnight but weren\u2019t able to take them for long due to lack of space as they have 4 children themselves. SIL said that Emma was looking at a minimum of 5 days in hospital and then the baby would need to stay in hospital for a while \u2013 the baby came home just before Christmas.\n\nI told my SIL that we couldn\u2019t take the girls because we had just had our son and we were wanting to spend the time just bonding as a family of three. SIL angrily told me that having my new son didn\u2019t cancel out the fact I already had two daughters. I apologised and told her that I couldn\u2019t take them in right now but I would send her some money to help out while they have the girls. If we hadn\u2019t just brought him home, I would have taken the girls in but Lara and I had already decided that we didn\u2019t want any guests for the first few weeks and I had told Emma this.\n\nWhile Emma was in the hospital, the girls stayed with SIL and my brother another night before they went to stay with Emma\u2019s husband\u2019s parents. While the baby was in hospital, because Emma and her husband were spending most of their time at the hospital, they were cared for a lot by Emma\u2019s in laws or my SIL and brother. After a week or so, Lara and I offered to take the girls but they told us they didn\u2019t want to stay because we were more focused on our son. It did feel like they were just parroting what they had heard from the adults around them. Though admittedly with the sleepless nights I did forget some things such as the video call with the girls.\n\nAfter the baby came home and everything settled down with Emma, she sent me a long email in the middle of the night explaining that she was disappointed in my actions and thought that I would see this is a medical emergency and I wouldn\u2019t need to be asked to take them in. I told her that we had just had son and I had to think about his needs as well, especially when there was plenty of people around them to care for them. Emma\u2019s told me that any communication is to now go through the lawyer because she\u2019s fed up of dealing with me and is going to take me to court to get full custody instead of 50/50.\n\nI didn\u2019t think it was unreasonable to not take them in given we had just had a baby. Lara wants me to fix it as we can\u2019t afford my child maintenance more than doubling if Emma gets full custody.\n\nAITA for not taking my daughters in?\n\nEdit: My SIL and brother live in a small three bedroom house, having my daughters there as well meant that they were struggling more than usual for space. I don't blame them for trying for not being able to take them full time. They are saving up for a bigger house.   \nDon't get me wrong, I love my daughters. I cherish the time I get with them, if I lost custody I know Emma wouldn't allow me to get to see them. She had wanted full custody when we divorced, but I fought for 50/50. She was angry about the divorce.

That really sucks for them and sorry but it's probably time for family therapy to try to get ahead of this.  \n\nYou got three days solo with new baby and that's what you got. That's parent life.

Lara was about 10 weeks ahead of Emma. In November, Lara gave birth to our son a few days after his due date. Three days after he and Lara came home, I received a panicked call from my SIL asking if I could take my daughters (9F twins) as Emma had been taken to hospital the night before and was being taken for a c-section. SIL and my brother had taken the girls in overnight but weren\u2019t able to take them for long due to lack of space as they have 4 children themselves. SIL said that Emma was looking at a minimum of 5 days in hospital and then the baby would need to stay in hospital for a while \u2013 the baby came home just before Christmas.  \n\nI told my SIL that we couldn\u2019t take the girls because we had just had our son and we were wanting to spend the time just bonding as a family of three. SIL angrily told me that having my new son didn\u2019t cancel out the fact I already had two daughters. I apologised and told her that I couldn\u2019t take them in right now but I would send her some money to help out while they have the girls. If we hadn\u2019t just brought him home, I would have taken the girls in but Lara and I had already decided that we didn\u2019t want any guests for the first few weeks and I had told Emma this.\n\nWhile Emma was in the hospital, the girls stayed with SIL and my brother another night before they went to stay with Emma\u2019s husband\u2019s parents. While the baby was in hospital, because Emma and her husband were spending most of their time at the hospital, they were cared for a lot by Emma\u2019s in laws or my SIL and brother. After a week or so, Lara and I offered to take the girls but they told us they didn\u2019t want to stay because we were more focused on our son. It did feel like they were just parroting what they had heard from the adults around them. Though admittedly with the sleepless nights I did forget some things such as the video call with the girls.  \n\nAfter the baby came home and everything settled down with Emma, she sent me a long email in the middle of the night explaining that she was disappointed in my actions and thought that I would see this is a medical emergency and I wouldn\u2019t need to be asked to take them in. I told her that we had just had son and I had to think about his needs as well, especially when there was plenty of people around them to care for them. Emma\u2019s told me that any communication is to now go through the lawyer because she\u2019s fed up of dealing with me and is going to take me to court to get full custody instead of 50/50.  \n\nI didn\u2019t think it was unreasonable to not take them in given we had just had a baby. Lara wants me to fix it as we can\u2019t afford my child maintenance more than doubling if Emma gets full custody.\n\nAITA for not taking my daughters in?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This was during the week of spring break which happened to end on Easter Sunday. After they transferred him to a children\u2019s hospital out of town, my younger brother and I were alone. My dad refused to come over and watch us or let us stay at his (girlfriend\u2019s) house because he had to prep for Easter mass as he was leading the chorale all weekend.

What did you do?\" Imagine having a medical emergency during your pregnancy that could have major negative ramifications (an emergency C-section at 30 weeks is nothing to sneeze at) and then finding out your ex refused to take his daughters for at least a week (\"a week or so\" is doing a fair bit of work here, methinks) because he wanted to \"bond as a family of 3\". I definitely do not blame her for now having all communication going through her lawyers - between that, and the child support comment, he's definitely going to admit he doesn't want to be the twin's father at some stage, and this will help her custody case.\n\nI'm putting a decent amount of the blame on Lara here as well - normally I hate blaming the new partner for something the parent of the children has done, but it sounds a lot like she's ready to be rid of the twins that aren't her kids and focus on her real child, she just doesn't like the fact that this will cost her money.
