Ya\u2019ll lost your sleep deprived  minds, which is understandable a month old baby means y\u2019all have had around 8 minutes of sleep in that time. You guys have a pretty good excuse, but still slight assholes you can\u2019t expect to cook that kind of dinner silently.

Parents are tired, babies wake up, babies cry nothing is earth shattering about that.  You said the baby had a terrible night prior to their arrival, and didnt sleep much.  Maybe whatever was waking the baby at night was waking the baby in the day time and they just thought it was the cooking.\nI tend to think ot wasnt the cooking because if a baby is sleeping in a room away from the kitchen with the door closed it is unlikely any cooking noises woke the baby.  Honestly, babies have been  crying on holidays since the time holidays began, at least your wife didnt have to cook while being tired from a sleepless night, many women do, i tend to think your wife is a primadonna", "YTA, and your wife as well.

I had a horrible sleeper who didn\u2019t go down longer than 45 minutes at a time for 14 months - buy a sound machine. The world is not quiet, and some babies just don\u2019t get used to noise.

It's ridiculous to blame your sister", "YTA. Why would you think your house would be the best place to cook a thanksgiving dinner with a newborn? Your wife is still recovering. Newborns are difficult and exhausting. Cooking a Thanksgiving dinner is a lot of activity, hard work and unlikely to be done in total silence. You should have skipped Thanksgiving this year or kept it at your mother\u2019s house where you could just appear for the meal or not as you felt. Not sure if this decision was you being selfish and wanting the world to revolve around you and your new baby or just a first time parent mistake, but you were definitely in the wrong. Apologize to your mom and sister.", "YTA. Unfortunately, some newborn/infants are wakeful and some can sleep through an earthquake. I have one of each.\n\n1) Put on a white noise machine (or play it on your phone, you can find some white noise channels on youtube), make the room a little chilly, put the baby in a snuggly bodysuit with a clean diaper, and then do a feeding/burping/farting. I am not joking about the farting. Again, youtube some videos, but babies are just starting to get used to digesting things and they have limited gut biome. They get a little gassy and you can help them with that.\n\n2) Big meals / big events are stressful for parents of newborns. If you can afford it, just order in. Or if your mom/sister are nice enough to cook for you, maybe see if they can bring all the food pre-prepared so you can just stick things in the oven/on the stove.\n\n3) Don\u2019t lash out at people who are helping you.

The family was very considerate about your situation, they moved the location of Thanksgiving to make it easier for you who just had a baby. But then you failed. Cooking WILL make some noises! But will it wake up a baby? Maybe. We decided to NOT have super quiet when we had a baby because we didn't want our baby to only be able to sleep if it was quiet since it will really limit you to do so. Our baby actually slept in the room just next to the kitchen and we could cook and talk normal without waking her up.\n\nThe real question is, where were you in all this? Your mother and sister did the cooking. Wife and baby were trying to sleep but what did YOU did besides complaining to your mother and sister about cooking noises? Why didn't you just put the baby in the pram and take them out? Fresh air and movement will put most babies to sleep and with the baby out of the house for a while your wife could have napped nicely. Because you said the cooking woke the baby up, and I'm guessing after that your wife woke up. So what did you do during all of this? How did you help?", "Yta.

They did too, to get food cooked for a whole family,  including wife and baby. \n\nIf your wife and baby were in need of extra sleep, you could have asked mom and sis to come later/eat later, or you could have canceled. \n\nInstead, you ruined their holiday too.

Yes sometimes pots and pans and mixers, chopping and so on can be somewhat loud. Seriously,  don't invite people over if they aren't able too speak in a normal tone of voice. You've not told us one single thing that either your mother or sister did intentionally that was abnormally loud. I know having a newborn is difficult,  they don't sleep well, any little sound bothers them then welcome to a 3 hr crying jag. I know, I get it. But you don't invite people over for a celebratory meal and expect them not to walk or talk or go the bathroom.  You both owe them a big apology and if they bought the food, you should reimburse them adding a nice bottle of wine for each one.\nYTA as is your wife.", "It's super weird they expected ppl to come over to cook and make zero noise. Why wouldn't the suggestion be; lets pack everything up and go to your house? I'll bring a plate home for my wife if she can't make it", "Yeah... Going to have to agree. Plus, babies generally sleep fine in a noisy environment. Trying to keep everything silent is just going to make them get startled at tiny noises.", "And wasting food.

I read everything online that says you need to let them sleep during the day out in the open, light, with noise all around them so that's what I tried to do with my son. From 3 weeks to 8 weeks this kid WOULD NOT sleep during the day. He would fuss and cry and I was ready to jump out the window and end my misery until I tried a dark room with white noise for naps and all of a sudden he was the best napper. By 12 weeks all I had to do was give him a kiss and lay him in his crib and he would just instantly fall asleep. No more walking, bouncing, rocking for hours on end. It was fantastic!", "It seems to me like OP asked them to come, and his family are NTA for that.

Op and wife deeply underestimated what this would be.", "Boy, I sure hope so.", "Not to mention Thanksgiving usually involves mashed potatoes so his sister had to use the mixer at least ONCE right?

OP asked his mother and sister to come over and cook the entire meal in OP's house, but they weren't allowed to make any noise. Then he kicked them out and sulked because they hadn't finished cooking. \n\nThat's more than sleep deprivation. He wanted servants who knew their place.", "OP and his wife are probably those insufferable people who throw insanely extravagant first birthday parties, under the guise of it being for the child who is too young to even remember it.", "I thought this was perhaps the most ridiculous part of all.", "Yeah I\u2019ve seen a few parents on IG that can run a vacuum without their baby waking up because they never kept quite when the baby napped and it helped them a lot.

Second child definitely more bomb proof", "And as an aside, they will make better neighbours/roommates as young adults. Everyone hates the roommate who complains about every little noise while they are trying to sleep.", "exactly! new parents seem to think baby needs silence to sleep... do you really think a hospital is completely silent? You need to make some noise so the baby won't wake up at every little sound known to man because guess what.. you cannot control the world! A dog outside can bark, a car can back fire, a horn can honk and of course music blasting from outside... the world is noise.. don't teach that baby a false narrative.", "Ooh, I wonder if \"light sleepers\" all had parents who kept it quite while they slept.", "I vacuumed, washed dishes, watched TV, made general noise, etc. And my three year old can sleep through almost anything. Noise is normal, the world isn't going to cater to a baby who's used to silence, better to have them used to it.", "Absolutely. I know people who have kids who cannot sleep anywhere but their homes, or with extremely specific requirements - who are now of typical 'sleepover' ages (think late elementary/middle school ages, some even teenagers!), and they're all 'OMGZ! How do you do sleepovers/summer camp! Kid has to have blackout currents/nightlight/this song/requirement xyz to sleep' - its ridiculous. \n\nMy kids have always been able to sleep pretty much wherever. They slept in our beds and cribs and were worn a LOT while sleeping - but it meant they slept while at the grocery store, at museums and zoos, and everywhere else with all sorts of hubbub going on around them.

When OP\u2019s wife tried that, she and the baby were repeatedly woken. I get a feeling that Sister was being purposefully loud to see if she could get OP\u2019s wife to come down with the baby.

We usually do thanksgiving at my moms house but with the new baby we decided to do it at our house this year\n\nI'm dying to hear to reasoning behind this incredibly stupid idea. Have you and your wife put any thoughts behind it? Of course it's going to be a disaster. You're hosting a party, there is going to be noise. By bringing the ruckus into your home you simply deprived your wife and the baby the option of leaving and have some much needed rest if necessary.\n\n>Baby had a terrible night the night before thanksgiving\n\nThen cancel. If the baby had a terrible night it implies that one of you had to take care of it and shared that terrible night. 2/3 people are not in a good shape to have a party that day.\n\n>My sister repeatedly made noise and woke up baby multiple times I kept warning her. She said she wasn\u2019t trying to make a lot of noise and was just cooking and was trying to be as quiet as she could.\n\nOk so clearly you're starting to realize that wasn't such a good idea, right? But it's too late now, so at least try to salvage it, dont you think? You seem to imply that only the sister made \"too much noise\" and not the mother. Ok??? Then just thank your sister for the work she put in so far and that it's better if ahe just chills in the living room while you and your mom finish the cooking. You DID help with the cooking, right?? I hope you didnt just invite two women into your home and expected to do all the work while you sit around all day.\n\n>By the third time my wife was in tears and so was baby my wife flipped\n\nWell YEAH obviously, if your only solution was to look at your sister and go \"hey can you make less noise\" without trying to come up with a proper solution, it will just happen again. Clearly the circumstances are not ordinary, so why not just forgoe the \"classic thanksgiving dinner\" for something more laid back and order some food to be delivered ?\n\n>I didn\u2019t want to kick my mom out but since sister was the one making the noise I told her to just leave before my wife lost it more.\n\nBut why tho ???? You clearly are aware enough that your wife is in the middle of a breakdown and isnt asking for something reasonable, but instead of trying to calm everyone down and offer to compromise, you kick your sister out ? Just ask her to stop cooking for christ sake. It would literally solve the problem without the unecessary drama\n\n>We ordered take out and a lot of the uncooked food went to waste.\n\nCongratulations but you could have done that before being an asshole to your mom and sister.  Also why was the food \"wasted\" exactly ? Do you simply refuse to cook or did you realize that you couldnt do it without making any noise either?\n\n>Wife is still upset because she thinks they should have been more considerate of baby and baby\u2019s first thanksgiving was ruined.\n\nWife should be upset at you for being so useless. The baby doesnt care and never will, it's one month old. Do you remember your first thanksgiving?\n\n>Mom and sister are upset \n\nOf course they are upset.
