Ya\u2019ll lost your sleep deprived  minds, which is understandable a month old baby means y\u2019all have had around 8 minutes of sleep in that time. You guys have a pretty good excuse, but still slight assholes you can\u2019t expect to cook that kind of dinner silently.

Parents are tired, babies wake up, babies cry nothing is earth shattering about that.  You said the baby had a terrible night prior to their arrival, and didnt sleep much.  Maybe whatever was waking the baby at night was waking the baby in the day time and they just thought it was the cooking.\nI tend to think ot wasnt the cooking because if a baby is sleeping in a room away from the kitchen with the door closed it is unlikely any cooking noises woke the baby.  Honestly, babies have been  crying on holidays since the time holidays began, at least your wife didnt have to cook while being tired from a sleepless night, many women do, i tend to think your wife is a primadonna", "YTA, and your wife as well.

Not to mention, you kicked them out on a special occasion meant to be shared as a family. That makes you both the assholes.\n\nYou couldn't predict that your baby was going to be having a bad night the night before, but you absolutely could predict that this day wasn't going to be easy, that the house was going to be louder than usual, and that there would be a higher level of stress for all of you. If this was something you weren't up to endure, you shouldn't have planned to host Thanksgiving.\n\nYou owe your mother and sister an apology. Both of you.

I had a horrible sleeper who didn\u2019t go down longer than 45 minutes at a time for 14 months - buy a sound machine. The world is not quiet, and some babies just don\u2019t get used to noise. You owe your sister and mom an apology, but since all new parents are a bit precious from lack of sleep and the overwhelming feeling of having a baby to take care of they will hopefully forgive and forget quick. \n\nEither way don\u2019t count your babies \u201cfirst\u201d holidays yet.

It's ridiculous to blame your sister", "YTA. Why would you think your house would be the best place to cook a thanksgiving dinner with a newborn? Your wife is still recovering. Newborns are difficult and exhausting. Cooking a Thanksgiving dinner is a lot of activity, hard work and unlikely to be done in total silence. You should have skipped Thanksgiving this year or kept it at your mother\u2019s house where you could just appear for the meal or not as you felt. Not sure if this decision was you being selfish and wanting the world to revolve around you and your new baby or just a first time parent mistake, but you were definitely in the wrong. Apologize to your mom and sister.", "YTA. Unfortunately, some newborn/infants are wakeful and some can sleep through an earthquake. I have one of each.\n\n1) Put on a white noise machine (or play it on your phone, you can find some white noise channels on youtube), make the room a little chilly, put the baby in a snuggly bodysuit with a clean diaper, and then do a feeding/burping/farting. I am not joking about the farting. Again, youtube some videos, but babies are just starting to get used to digesting things and they have limited gut biome. They get a little gassy and you can help them with that.\n\n2) Big meals / big events are stressful for parents of newborns. If you can afford it, just order in. Or if your mom/sister are nice enough to cook for you, maybe see if they can bring all the food pre-prepared so you can just stick things in the oven/on the stove.\n\n3) Don\u2019t lash out at people who are helping you.

The family was very considerate about your situation, they moved the location of Thanksgiving to make it easier for you who just had a baby. But then you failed. Cooking WILL make some noises! But will it wake up a baby? Maybe. We decided to NOT have super quiet when we had a baby because we didn't want our baby to only be able to sleep if it was quiet since it will really limit you to do so. Our baby actually slept in the room just next to the kitchen and we could cook and talk normal without waking her up.\n\nThe real question is, where were you in all this? Your mother and sister did the cooking. Wife and baby were trying to sleep but what did YOU did besides complaining to your mother and sister about cooking noises? Why didn't you just put the baby in the pram and take them out? Fresh air and movement will put most babies to sleep and with the baby out of the house for a while your wife could have napped nicely. Because you said the cooking woke the baby up, and I'm guessing after that your wife woke up. So what did you do during all of this? How did you help?", "Yta.

They did too, to get food cooked for a whole family,  including wife and baby. \n\nIf your wife and baby were in need of extra sleep, you could have asked mom and sis to come later/eat later, or you could have canceled. \n\nInstead, you ruined their holiday too.

She was doing a very nice thing, FOR YOU, and you kicked them out. \n\nIf your wife/child had been up all night and needed absolute silence to sleep, you should have canceled in the morning.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never experienced Thanksgiving. I get that you\u2019re new to parenting, but there are so many helpful tips on how to get babies to sleep and stay asleep with white noise that drowns out household noises that would otherwise disturb the baby.

I wasn't there so I don't know if sister was being excessively noisy or not. \n\nSeveral things could have happened to avoid this...if mom and sis were going to cook they could have cooked elsewhere and brought it. You could have called and said hey it was a bad night can we delay cooking a few hours so mom and baby can get a few hours of sleep. They could still come over if they want but just not start the noisy cooking part.   Could wife and baby have moved farther away from the kitchen ? There are apps that allow you to play soothing sounds that could have helped baby sleep and blocked out the noise in the kitchen.\n\nI understand your wife was acting out of exhaustion and everyone over reacted in a tired tense situation. It is easy to look back and say do this or do that but when you are in the moment you don't always have the ability to stop and try to see all sides.\n\nInvite mom and sister over......have a conversation about how exhausted and over whelmed you both were that day and you are sorry it got out of hand.
