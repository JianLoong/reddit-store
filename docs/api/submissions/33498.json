I mean you made a change to accommodate your friend which is great but if the party is at his house, the idea that he can control the guest list is reasonable. However he should give some leeway given the accommodations you are making. It sounds like you are trying to guilt him for not being able to attend in order to get people he doesn\u2019t necessarily want in his home. \n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
