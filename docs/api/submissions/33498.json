Your friend can\u2019t walk but can certainly run that mouth!", "This.  Next year have your party at your house.", "I mean he can do anything. It just makes him an asshole", "So my annual party. My friends. My guest list. I help him by moving the whole shebang and not acceding to his every request makes me an AH? Settled. Next year he drags his ass upstairs.", "For sure.", "Ok so you are not his friend based on what you posted. No friend would talk about him the way you did.", "No \"friend\" would ask the things that he asked of OP either. \n\nLooks like he can spend next Christmas alone while OP gets to enjoy his party in the comfort of his own home and surrounded by people who won't try to drag the party down.", "NTA but I'm guessing this is ultimately a story about dealing with\n\n> recently lost the ability to walk\n\nrather than a party guest list", "NTA. He should have thought about the guest list before suggesting (or asking?) to have the party at his place. And yes, it's your party, not his. It's fair to not want \"strangers\" in your house, but then he shouldn't have brought up the idea in the first place. He basically offered to host it, which he shouldn't have done if he wanted to be picky about who could come and who couldn't.", "I'm going to say NTA. You moved your party to his space at his request, you didn't request to use his space to have a party. \n\nMy house is not good for hosting, my best friend's place is. I often use his space for hosting. Before inviting anyone I confirm that my guest list is okay, times, if I need to come do anything week of to help prepare etc. Because I'm requesting to use his space for my convenience and he's kind enough to let me every time. \n\nYou agreed to the move because you care about your friend and want him there. If there were other strings tied to moving the party for his accommodations then those needed to be stated before you agreed to the move. If he had placed these restrictions before you agreed to move I'm guessing you probably wouldn't have agreed to the move with the additional restrictions.", "NTA.  Don't do this again.", "NTA and unfortunately you need to host at your home in future.", "NTA He doesn't really sound like a friend.", "A more simple solution would have simply moved it to a different accessible venue, not his house. I\u2019m a paraplegic and that\u2019s what I would have suggested. He wasn\u2019t cool for being so demanding about the guest list, so you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA.\n\nMoving it to his home was to accommodate him so he could attend, not so he could take over as the host and planner.\n\nIf he is going to make people feel awkward and unwelcome so he can attend, then next time, he might find himself not invited for the comfort of everyone else.\n\nI'm hoping this is him just being crabby because being recently disabled sucks and not how he always is. Next time, host somewhere else that is not his place but that he can still access.", "NTA If something like this even hints at happening again, tell your friend that this *won't* happen again. Then have the party at your place. He can get carried (if possible) or not come, but while you can totally accommodate his disability, you aren't dealing with his attitude.", "NAH\n\nIt's your party but it's his home. I can see why he felt like he should have a say. It's not a mistake, but it would have been better to just find a neutral location. That way there is no grey area about who is hosting.", "NTA.\n\nBut it would not hurt to apologize for having your party at his house and let him know that this will not happen again.", "NTA. You did the best you could. He didn't appreciate what you did for him. No good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA for doing it this once. You tried to be a good friend and he kinda blew that up. I wouldn\u2019t do it again at his place. He can have his own party next year.", "NTA. You should never have let it happen at his house. Chalk it up to a lesson learnt and not to be repeated. Next time your place or neutral location.", "NTA for not uninviting others, but you may be TA for not uninviting him due to his rude behavior. You subjected everyone to him.", "NTA.  It sounds to me as if he weaponizes his disability.  I'd think twice about whether I wanted to continue being friends with him.", "NTA", "NTA but you should have had the foresight to remind him when you moved locations that it was still your party and that their may be guests he does not know,", "NTA But it looks like you know you can't host it at his house in the future or this will continue to be an issue.", "NTA Your friend is the asshole.", "NAH\n\nHe doesn't want your party going on in his house so move it back unless he removes his demands.", "NTA, You should walk away from this relationship.", "Him: Can we have the party at my house?\n\nAlso him: Why are there people in a party at my house?\n\nNTA", "I agree, but don\u2019t invite him next year\u2026", "It's a grey area though. It's a private home meaning that even though OP hosted, it's still the friend's house and the friend could kick people out or even call the cops if he doesn't want them there. I do agree with NTA, just explaining certain things for people who might not understand how it works. The private home part makes it a bit more complicated. But you can and should be able to have a say over who comes to your house if someone else is hosting a party at your house within reason.\n\nFor example, if you allow me to host a party at your house and I invite your abusive ex, you can 100% say \"I do not want them there.\" You can call the cops on them for being there. That would be valid. Or the person your ex cheated with. Or someone who stole from you. Or someone you know is genuinely not a good person. These are what I mean by within reason. Not petty shit like OP's friend is doing.", "Definitely; not just the adjustment to not being as mobile but I'm sure it's a kick in the teeth when you have to accept situations you normally aren't comfortable with just to *participate* the way you normally would.\n\nDude was kind of an asshole but hopefully he's just adjusting still.", "That last bit is harsh. \" Recently lost the ability to walk\" may not have been enough time for him to even form a plan for the rest of his life. So many things you don't think about until you've lost a major source of independence and then you realize how much has to change and what the new reality is - what could work and what can't/shouldn't. \nNTA but this may be one of many painful learning experiences for this friend. Give him time.", "Egregious handling and attitude aside, I'm shocked how other people are acting like he was entitled beyond belief expressing he wasn't stoked for strangers or people he doesn't like in his house during. NTA obviously because a normal human being would ask for the guest list when finding out they're semi co-hosting a party.", "Savage", "So OP is supposed to prioritize this one friend over all their other friends? OP was throwing a party FOR ALL OP\u2019s FRIENDS, not just the disabled one. They agreed to move the party so that the disabled friend could attend and then that friend try to hijack the guest list at the last minute. If the friend was going to have issues with strangers or other friends of OP, the time to mention it would have been when he offered his house for OPs party (not his, OPs). Then OP could have looked for a third venue or decided whether or not to keep it at their house. The friend is providing the venue, OP did the planning and is presumably providing food, entertainment, etc. There is an AH here, it is not OP.  Now if friend had stated up front they had an issue with strangers or people they did not like in their house and OP accepted the use of friend\u2019s house anyway then got pissy, OP would be the AH. But friend trying to dictate the guest list a couple of days before the party when the agreement to use friend\u2019s house was made days or weeks before that is BS. You don\u2019t get to be a controlling asshat just because you can\u2019t walk or climb stairs. Saying otherwise makes you an ableist. You are being condescending towards people with disabilities by holding them to different standards of behavior just because they are physically disabled.", "Did you read the post?", "I get the point you're trying to make, but it isn't relevant to this specific situation. The only reason the party is at OP's friend's house is to make sure the friend doesn't have to miss out. Sure, the friend could call the cops and get people kicked out, but that would be a major asshole move. Given that, his only real options are to miss out on the party or let OP host the normal party at his house. Trying to suddenly dictate terms when the party was only moved so he can attend is super entitled, shitty behavior. \n\nIf the party had proceeded at OP's house as it always has, nothing would've changed. In that case, he'd have no recourse other than to leave in the situations you mention like OP inviting an abusive ex.", "\"Can you have the party at my house?\"\n\n\"Sure! We can do that!\"\n\n\"Ok now that the party is a few days away here's all the people I already knew were going to come and now want you to uninvite.\"\n\nYou see how that's a jerk move?", "I live on the second floor of a building that doesn't have elevators, because it's only two floors. I walk everywhere I need to go, in my town. Losing the ability to walk is my biggest fear. Everything about my life would have to change.", "Fair", "As long as you don't request an entire party move to your house and then uninvite people you already knew were going to come a few days before the party you're good.", "I agree with you. Please trust me, while the guy was turdy for making demands about the guest list, I can\u2019t begin to explain to you how much and how often the stair situation happens and it sucks sooooo much. Paraplegic for many years now, so please take my word for it."]}
