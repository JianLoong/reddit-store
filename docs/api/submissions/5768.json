If someone says you hurt them, and your first reaction is \"they're just sensitive,\" you don't actually care about people.

I am even disappointed with their parents for keeping quite.", "INFO: whats the context of saying that to your uncle? as you wrote it doesnt seem like they find him by himself on a room and said that unprovoked.\n\nwhat were they doing and why did he approach them?\n\nthats sounds like half of the story right now.", "NTA They treated him horribly at a family gathering with no provocation and he did the right thing by trying to leave. You were not the AH here.", "You're NTA at all and one day someone isn't gonna take lightly to the fact they are trying to be bullies and it will not end in their favor.", "NTA. Your cousin was behaving badly. \"Insulting\" jokes and sarcasm are NOT acceptable behavior outside of your own close circle of friends who know you and are able to take it/give it back. Doing that to ANYONE else is just AH behavior. It's not FUNNY if the other person doesn't think it is. The doubling down usually happens when they KNOW they did wrong, are ashamed, and don't want to take ownership of it. They further ignored the uncle because they were embarrassed and too immature to deal with the situation they created. You were right to point out that even a fake apology wouldn't have cost them anything. This type of person usually has a lot of broken relationships and difficulties being employable - not many people will tolerate that behavior for long. I suspect your cousin is probably a bully too. They did ruin the evening, and you are not wrong for any of your words or actions.", "NTA. Your cousins need to learn that not every thought they have needs to be said aloud--especially if it's hurtful to another person. And, at 18-24 years old, it's high time they grow the eff up and act like decent human beings.", "NTA. Ah yes we\u2019re cruel to someone and they should just learn to live with it because they are too sensitive", "Heartless creeps. Do they like being called names? Saying someone won\u2019t understand something and referring to them as an old hag are two different animals.", "He is 65 year old, unmarried, no kids. He had no idea what a meme was, and asked about it when they were talking about memes. It really was an unwarranted response.", "I was at their house. Probably should've urged my family to follow my uncle and gone out to celebrate with him though.\n\nI felt really bad as a bystander.", "I guess you are also allergic to saying \"Sorry\" and \"thank you\", or just respecting someone who is 40 years older than you and has done nothing to you but love you.", "I\u2019m surprised that allergy hasn\u2019t put them in the hospital yet. \n\nAt least there they\u2019d actually be doing the world a favor.", "Well, just saying sorry without meaning it isn't truthful. BUT apologizing for hurting someone should be allowed.", "Definitely NTA. I was expecting the ages to be 7-10 not adults. Holy shit. Act like a fucking adult.", "INFO:  What were your cousins doing that they thought your uncle wouldn\u2019t get?", "Ye gods what awful kids. You\u2019re definitely NTA, they suck.", "NTA. They are a rude bunch of AHs and I can only hope if they have any ounce of decency left they will acknowledge their terrible behavior and apologize for the way they acted when you send them the link. I've met children who are better raised than these 18-24 yo bunch.", "NTA. So many adult I know who were allergic to the word sorry when I was a kid have ended up completely alone in their old age. They couldn\u2019t do it in their 20s, doubled down on their inability to apologize in their 30s and 40s, and now they are in their 60s wondering why no one visited them for Christmas. Their refusal to ever admit they were wrong has not been worth it.", "NTA..i can gaurantee your uncle gets what they are doing now...i remeber having those kind of thoughts as a teenager and only once i aged more did i realize that teenagers today, teenagers from the 90, 60, and even the 1930's did and do the same things...just have different layers of technology and different music playing in the background. Your cousins are imature AH's", "NTA\n\nYour cousins are rude. Thank you for standing up for your uncle!", "Are you one of the cousins?", "Where tf were their parents? If I mouthed off to someone without cause, my mom would have taken care of me in short order. OP shouldn't have had to say anything, but I guess hearing disapproval from someone in your age group should have at least made them think. The offending adult brats should not be invited to family functions till they apologize and grow up.", "I will add that yes it can be a magical word, however saying Sorry isn't always enough. I have loved the example as follows:\nTake an empty water bottle, crumble it it up. As tight as you can get it. Really twist it and squeeze it. ( that is the hurtful comment or action) now, blow the bottle back out ( thats the word / phrase \"I'm sorry\") . See all the wrinkles? The creases, and blemishes ? It's not the same as it was before. ( that's the after effect of the apology). Sometimes saying I'm sorry isn't enough. The actions that go along with the apology are important as well. You can \" I'm sorry\" and not mean it.", "You need to edit this context into your main post. Without for all we know he was being insensitive, so it's important context for judgement.", "Your cousins are a piece of work. I don't need the added info, I assumed you heard the original exchange and judged them to be wrong.", "Echoing the other comment to say you should add this edit to the main post. \n\nContext is important here. With this info you\u2019re obviously NTA, but without it there\u2019s room to wonder if your uncle said something to provoke them.", "\"Nothing but love you\" sounds really creepy, when it is an adult man forcing that on his 18 year old relatives and not taking the hint. The uncle could talk to relatives his own age isntead of stalking the young girls dn pushing homself at them all evening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"r just respecting someone who is 40 years older than you and has done nothing to you but love you.\" .. For me, personally: Not that easy. Not many of those still around.", "I feel like your uncle said something to get told that and since you left out the context it's kinda hard to say. Also why would them ignoring him be that big of an issue ? Why would he wanna talk to them anyway if they're bein rude?", "All your cousins sucks, then they will be crying when they dont get gifts from family. Such a bunch of buttholes. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nI'm surprised he came back. Next time they start in on their bullying, though, don't try to convince their victim to just let it go. In fact, maybe walk away from them as well. Or even better, stop inviting them. The reason they get away with such nasty behavior is because people let them. Stop apologizing for them. They are awful people, let them apologize for themselves.", "NTA. These folks are 18-24 and are bullying thier uncle for being old and uncool and making family gatherings uncomfortable. I think the family needs to let them know that they apologize and change their behavior or they will no longer be included in family gatherings.", "NTA. I was really surprised when you mentioned their ages were form 18-24. They sound like immature middle school children and should now be treated as such.", "Nta", "Nta your cousins are terrible. One day there gonna be old and out of touch with things too.", "NTA. Your cousins are though. This is some mean girls shit.", "We can only hope. Little shits like that need to grow up and develop some empathy. NTA, OP.", "NTA obviously but it sounds like the bigger problem isn't just the lack of the word \"sorry,\" it's that they enjoy being willfully cruel, and when they see that they've hurt someone's feelings, they laugh even harder. If they had said \"sorry\" without meaning it, it wouldn't have been long before they started insulting him again and getting even more kicks out of it. They need to learn not to take joy in hurting other people, which is unfortunately a much harder lesson to learn.", "It sounds like you did the best you could at the time. Next time, if there is a next time, you have a better plan to leave with your uncle. Family situations can be pretty messy sometimes.", "Wow. That makes the cousins even worse. They did that to a guest invited to their home for Christmas. My heart goes out to your poor uncle.", "I have used a very similar example for my young children : take a piece if paper and rip it in half - that's what the action did, then tape it back together, it still works as paper but will never be the same as before"]}
