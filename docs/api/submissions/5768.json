Joking disparaging comments are only funny if everyone is in agreement that it's a funny joke.

Your cousin was behaving badly. \"Insulting\" jokes and sarcasm are NOT acceptable behavior outside of your own close circle of friends who know you and are able to take it/give it back. Doing that to ANYONE else is just AH behavior. It's not FUNNY if the other person doesn't think it is. The doubling down usually happens when they KNOW they did wrong, are ashamed, and don't want to take ownership of it. They further ignored the uncle because they were embarrassed and too immature to deal with the situation they created. You were right to point out that even a fake apology wouldn't have cost them anything. This type of person usually has a lot of broken relationships and difficulties being employable - not many people will tolerate that behavior for long. I suspect your cousin is probably a bully too. They did ruin the evening, and you are not wrong for any of your words or actions.", "NTA. Your cousins need to learn that not every thought they have needs to be said aloud--especially if it's hurtful to another person.

Ah yes we\u2019re cruel to someone and they should just learn to live with it because they are too sensitive", "Heartless creeps. Do they like being called names?

Probably should've urged my family to follow my uncle and gone out to celebrate with him though.\n\nI felt really bad as a bystander.", "I guess you are also allergic to saying \"Sorry\" and \"thank you\", or just respecting someone who is 40 years older than you and has done nothing to you but love you.", "I\u2019m surprised that allergy hasn\u2019t put them in the hospital yet. \n\nAt least there they\u2019d actually be doing the world a favor.", "Well, just saying sorry without meaning it isn't truthful. BUT apologizing for hurting someone should be allowed."]}
