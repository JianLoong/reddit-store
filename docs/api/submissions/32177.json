That should close every conversation. She cannot expect others to take care of her baby and spread bad words that someone isn\u2019t helping enough. If you know that you won\u2019t have a time and enough possibilities to raise a baby, just don\u2019t have a baby.\n\nAnd if I understand correctly, sometimes you spend 5 hours taking care of not your baby. That\u2019s a huge amount of time for not your baby. She should be grateful even without knowing that you have depression and you have to take care of yourself first, then about others. Having depression and spending 5 hours with a baby is an achievement and you should be proud of yourself. She should be very grateful too.", "NTA. Not your kid. You\u2019re 19 and your stepmom had a kid. Why should you be her kids nanny?", "NTA.  You have no responsibility over her child unless you consent to it.  This seems like a terrible situation.  Talk to your father about it to see if he can give you some support.", "NTA\n\nA mother and father have the core responsibility of looking after a baby, any assistance above and beyond is a goddamn blessing that should be appreciated \n\nIt is never the responsibility of an earlier child to take on any assistance unless they are willing to do so", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I really appreciate your words however and thank you greatly, I hope you have a wonderful day/night.", "Very true, I just feel bad as basically her other son is being a nanny for the kid and confided in me today that he would like some help. I just feel bad.\nThank you so much by the way I hope you have a great day/evening.", "I have and he said my mental health is more important, he understands it's difficult at times and I'm thankful that he does. Thank you so much for your comment I hope you have a great day/evening.", "I agree fully, my dad is fine with helping as he loves being a dad. Though I believe more often then not she has her older son help out more with the baby instead of letting him do his own thing, I do feel bad about it but you are correct as it is not my responsibility and that I can help when asked/when I want tl. I thank you greatly and I hope you have a wonderful day/evening.", "You are absolutely NOT being a sick, it was her choice to have a child and it is the baby\u2019s PARENTS responsibility to do the child care. She doesn\u2019t seem to understand the reality of a person\u2019s having TBI.", "It\u2019s not fair for either of you. Why did she have another child if she was going to pawn it off on the other siblings? You sound like a good person. Even though you seem to be torn about your own situation you\u2019re still concerned for another in the same boat. That I find commendable. Just remember, don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm. You have a good evening as well.", "Thank you so much, and I have no clue either. All I know is she's going to get held once she's 3 months postpartum so I'm very thankful for that, hopefully with that help her mental state will improve.\n\nI thank you again for your comment."]}
