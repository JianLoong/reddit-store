You both had one you wanted to see, and neither wanted to compromise or was willing to give up. If it had meant that much to her she could have gone with you.", "Holy crap I thought your marriage ended at the festival based on your title. Way happier with what the conflict ended out being. \n\n\nNTA only thing I disagree with you doing was saying she saw them a few months ago. It seemed like a straight forward compromise to each goto the band you wanted  to see rather than one of you being miserable watching a band you really didn't want to goto. \n\nYour both equally at fault for not compromising for the other and equally valid for not wanting too.\n\nDoes not qualify as ESH because no one rose to the level of AH", "nta\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbest option was to split. She can't say she's disappointed when she wanted you to skip seeing a band you haven't seen for 10 years for a band she saw 2 months ago. If said that way it seems very selfish of her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS", "NTA - You literally both did the same thing.\n\nIf she holds against you just ask why she didn\u2019t come to the set that you preferred. Neither of your opinions should trump the other.", "NTA.  My husband and I have a music festival we\u2019ve been going to every year for a decade.  We spend maybe 60 percent of it together.  He sees what he wants and I see what I want.  If your wife wanted to stay together the whole time so badly then she could have gone with you to see the group you wanted to see.", "NTA. Maybe go tell your parents on her now?", "NTA - her response seems one sided. Why is she allowed to never miss this band for any reason, but you're not allowed to see another band you haven't seen in years? Honestly, some things aren't about being right. If you feel bad do something nice for her. It doesn't have to be anything big, at all. Also, you don't have to do a thing either. It's just a suggestion. But, as for your question: no, you don't sound at all like the asshole.", "NTA You wife is the asshole here. If it was SO IMPORTANT to be with you every second then. she could have easily skipped seeing the band she had just seen a few months ago (like you DID do for her)\n\nShe was the only one unwilling to compromise and is ruining the whole trip by reframing it as you abandoning her instead of admitting that you both had a great time and that an hour apart isn\u2019t important and if it was it was ON HER to make that happen but SHE WOULD RATHER SEE HER FAVORITE BAND than hang out with you every second (which is fine) but then she makes that YOUR fault? It was her choice!", "NTA, especially since y'all had just seen the group she wanted to see a couple months earlier. I guess you could suggest to her for the next anniversary trip that you should both settle on something that you'll be happy to attend together the entire way through.", "NTA- if she needed to be with you the whole time, she should have gone with you instead of doing her own thing. why do you have to make the compromise? ridiculous."]}
