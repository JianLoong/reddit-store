{"id": 21638, "submission_id": "14trowd", "title": "AITA for getting my son reinstated to his team after he got kicked off as punishment?", "selftext": "This incident happened last August, but just recently my MIL gave us a piece of her mind about it and it got me thinking about it again. My son, at the time, was a high school sophomore and both his freshman and sophomore years (and hopefully his junior year) he was the top performer by far on his cross country team.\n\nThey practice every day during the season, and maybe twice a week they would run around a nearby lake. To get to this lake my son\u2019s coach had them take a shortcut through an upper income gated community; there are two public openings for pedestrians they would run through. During my son\u2019s freshman year and the beginning of sophomore year, there were many issues with residents in this community giving runners attitude or acting suspicious of them. One old man yelled and cussed and threatened to call the cops on them when he saw them entering, and my son\u2019s teammates and close friend (who is black) had a woman threaten to call the cops on him when she saw him running by her house. The coach\u2019s advice to them was \u201cjust ignore them.\u201d\n\nOne day, the second week of my son\u2019s cross country season last year, a woman (who he described as \u201cboomer-aged\u201d) asked my son in an annoying, suspicious, clueless tone, \u201cWhy are you running?\u201d My son shrugged and responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, why are you so fat?\u201d The woman complained about it to the school, and my son\u2019s coach told him he was cut from the team for the rest of the season. This was devastating to him. I was upset my son spoke to this woman this way, but I agreed with him that the punishment was excessive for just one rude comment. My biggest concern was that being off the team for a whole season could make it much harder for him to get an athletic-based scholarship or get into a good college.\n\nI had a conversation with the principal and shared my opinions with him, and also expressed concern that his coach had done a poor job of dealing with the situation of students being harassed by residents of the community. The principal arranged a meeting between myself, the coach and him, and after having a long talk about it he stated that he wanted my son\u2019s coach to reduce his punishment to a 2-week suspension. I could tell his coach was not happy about it but he went with it, and my son got back on the team. The rest of the year they did not run through that community again.\n\nWe recently went to visit my MIL who lives far away, and my son was telling her about all his cross country successes. She got angry at him and said, \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d and told him she had heard about him being kicked off the team and reinstated from one of his cousins. She went on this big rant about how he should have accepted his consequence, how she\u2019s disgusted he\u2019d talk to a woman that way, and that he\u2019ll grow up having no respect for women or anyone.

And his brain isn\u2019t fully developed yet. Teenagers sometimes say stupid things. You sound like a good Mom who made riptide clear that what he said was not okay. I\u2019m sure he has learned his lesson.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. I had a mouth on me when I was a kid and it was not a sign of future problems or bad behavior. I simply did not think that adults deserved automatic respect when they were not prepared to reciprocate.\n\nYour son needed to learn the proper way to handle things, how far to push things and under what circumstances. I would have made sure to impress on him that as part of the sports team he was representing the school so he needed to keep to a higher level of behavior than if it were just about himself and nobody else.\n\nAlso you did not totally condone his behavior.

It wasn\u2019t her business what he was doing (especially since the team runs through there often). Op\u2019s post says there are public openings to the neighborhood. You don\u2019t move to a neighborhood with walking trails if you\u2019re worried about people using them. \n\nThis shouldn\u2019t even have been a school matter. Coach should\u2019ve called you after the complaint and voiced his concerns. I\u2019d be so upset if my hypothetical child\u2019s leader called a meeting about my child defending themselves outside of school and then wanting school related punishment for it.

It seems that the residents were harassing the team continually, and you son did give it back to one of them, albeit in a nasty fashion. However, I do not understand the coach's decision to expel him (don't coaches always back up their \"stars\") unless he faced some community pressure. The principal made the correct call, reversing what could have been a life changing (scholarship can have that kind of effect) decision based on an off-hand nasty comment. And your MIL sounds like a treat.", "NTA - She asked a stupid question and got a stupid answer.

That coach was knowingly sending kids into a hostile and potentially dangerous situation and it was bound to escalate eventually. All the adults involved should be grateful this happened before a resident made an even bigger problem. Sometimes in life if the authorities responsible won't acknowledge an issue you have to force a situation that requires it be addressed. I doubt that was your kid's intention and he was just over being leered at and harassed but he still got the problem solved for the rest of the team. \n\n\nWonder a little about why your MIL relates to the homeowner who felt entitled to harass children using a public resource to exercise and you'll feel less bad. Your kid's remark was offensive and worth a lesson too but his retaliation was extremely reasonable for a child in that circumstance and the original punishment was excessive imo", "ESH. Son was clearly in the wrong, coach overreacted, you stepped in when your son is old enough to deal with his own consequences, the principal overrode the coach's decision, and MIL kind of came out of left field there.\n\nExcept did the coach really overreact?

Principal's an AH for not backing the teacher and caving to you. Coach is an AH for not dealing with the homeowners.

MIL...slight AH for bringing it up unless she just found out about it. \n\nYou're an AH for not having him accept the consequences.  BTW....in the future,  not all consequences are going to be fair and you're not always going to be there to run interference for him. \n\nAnd incidentally,  it doesn't matter one fucking bit how good he was or whether he was a top performer or came in last every time.

I understand you not wanting him to miss out on scholarships, but your son needs to learn that actions have consequences and mommy isn't going to come and save him from those consequences. HOWEVER, the scholarship thing really is a big deal in this economy, so if you punished your son at home in some other way than a measly 2 week suspension, then I'll give you the win. Otherwise Y T A.", "\\*\\*Edits, hit submit by accident was not even close to done.\n\nI have mixed feelings here, when you play sports your team has an expectation for how you conduct yourself (speaking from experience). And after being told to ignore the people in this community.\n\nI do not know of many gated communities that have public access to them for pedestrians, it defeats the purpose of a gated community. So they were likely trespassing with their shortcut, even if the coach is the one who told them to take it. (The coach is likely wrong here and he should be reprimanded by the school.)\n\nHe decided to shoot his mouth off for someone asking why he is running, he didn't have to reply at all, or could have simply said \"school sports\" and it ends right there. She clearly knew what school he was with so that was his bad choice to do. On the off chance that the school had a deal to allow access to that area for their runners, he put that in jeopardy. If the school didn't then he really had no right to be there. Even if this is a public access area this will cause issues with the school and the community.\n\nWhen he was punished for not ignoring people and just continuing on his run as he was told to do by his coach. He got punished because that is what happens, was it extreme? Sure, but he earned a punishment.\n\nI think this is a rare case of ESH but for different reasons.\n\n**Your Son** \\- Mouthing off when there was a far better way to handle it. If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.\n\n**Son's Coach** \\- Either trespassing with the team, or not dealing with the issues of the community properly if they had permission or rights to be there. Including likely not informing the office staff of the harassment issues.\n\n**Son's Principal** \\- Quickly kicking your son off the team, then backing off that position because well, he seems to have no spine. He just seems to want to make everyone happy.\n\n**The Community** \\- This would be long if I let myself, so let us simplify. Racism is the implied reason, as well as people wondering why their gated community suddenly has a bunch of kids running through it that don't live there.\n\n**You** \\- He did something he should have been punished for, it was a harsh punishment but he should have known better as well.  Your concern was more about financial obligations if he was unable to get a scholarship than what harm he could do to the school's reputation, the team's reputation, and if they had a right to it, the access to the shortcut. \n\nWhen you play a team sport what you do reflects on everyone else involved in the team, from the coach to the other players. When you get out of line, even when it's justifiable you have to expect consequences for it. You either accept that or you should not play a team sport.", "NTA: This punishment seems excessive. Yes, your son was rude to the woman, yes he could have handled it better, and yes there should be consequences. However, these consequences should match the crime. 2 weeks suspension sounds fair, but I also would have had hom apologize to the woman in person. Then he has consequences for his team, and on a personal level. If you punish too hard, it has the opposite effect you're aiming for. You want to discipline.  Root word, disciple.
