A week into school, I met a group of girls, Alicia (14F) Cara, Laurie & and Amber (15F) We had the same lunch period and spent time getting to know each other and I thought I was officially part of the team.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut after a few weeks, the only time we would ever talk was when they needed me to film a TikTok video and they didn\u2019t bother including me in anything. They started making comments about my body and how I wasn\u2019t skinny like them. I was already feeling self-conscious, but they only made me feel worse, calling me ugly, and that no guy would want to be with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to the school for help, but they said without evidence, they couldn\u2019t do anything. Soon, I started skipping meals. My parents eventually found out, and they begged me not to do that to myself. After months of being tortured mentally and physically by the girls and their other friends, I left the week before Winter break. It took me a while to feel like a normal person again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I\u2019m an 18F and life has gotten better. I got accepted to university and was awarded a scholarship. I met an amazing guy and we've started dating, and I\u2019ve learned to love my body.

That moment, I recognized her as Laurie, the one who bullied me the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe told me she was surprised to see me and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had money to be here,\u201d (rhymes with Casey's) the girls behind her giggled, I brushed it off. She then pointed to my thighs and reminded me how chunky they were. She then had the nerve to ask for my number so we could hang out again. I told her no. She looked at me confused \u201cWhy not? We used to be such good friends,\u201d I squinted and said, \u201cBecause why would I want to be friends with someone who bullied me into an ED? You acted like I didn\u2019t exist until you wanted me to grab you something or film stupid videos!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLaurie looked shocked and said she did no such thing. I told her she\u2019s delusional and I hoped one day she talked shit to the wrong person and gets her ass handed to her. Her face went white and she tried to redeem herself. I walked off and found my mom in another department. I told her what happened and she was proud of me, saying one day Karma was gonna be a bitch to Laurie and everyone who tormented me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I had to stand up for myself, but I can\u2019t help but feel bad for wishing ill-will on somebody.

Truth hurts, continue to live your life for you. Girls in high school, matter of fact A LOT of people in high school don't mean anything once you graduate. You're already at a different high school, getting ready for college, you don't need to feel bad for giving a bully a reality check.
