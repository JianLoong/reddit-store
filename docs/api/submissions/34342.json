Marco is biologically the son of my dad's paternal half-sister. She ended up dying in an accident, and my mom and dad adopted him, since his biological father wasn't in the picture. My brother was a baby when his biological mom died, so our dad and mom are the only parents he ever knew, and they always treated him like a son. Even after our parents divorced, mom always valued Marco like one of her own. Marco is considered the eldest, and I'm fine with that. He's always been my big brother, regardless of our biology.\n\nDad married 'Jess' a few years after he divorced our mom. Jess was nice to us at first. We weren't overly close, but we could be cool with each other. But when Jess and Dad had kids of their own, she began to get jealous that he still gave so much attention to us. She felt this way particularly to Marco, considering he's the adopted kid.\n\nAt some point, she and dad divorced. Why they did isn't exactly important, but the point is she's not our 'stepmom' anymore. It was a messy situation, let's just say that.\n\nDad's gone now. We're still in contact with Jess, but only because of our half-siblings, Emma 19(F) and Alex 18(M). Alex mostly, since he's a sensible kid, but Emma... For now, let's just say our relationship isn't too great.\n\nMy Grandmother (Dad's mom) wanted to see all of her grandkids recently, so we all went to visit her yesterday.\n\nWhile talking with her, Marco made a passing comment about how he used to love hanging here when me and him were kids, and how he'd always wished to stay there all the time. My grandma then laughed, and said, something like how that may happen, as she might be planning to leave this house to him once she passes away.\n\nJess, who was also there, took offense. She asked why Marco would get the house and not any of her kids. Grandma said that Marco is the eldest of her grandkids, so if she were to leave the house to someone, it'd be him. Jess got upset, and said that's a stupid precedent in which to leave a house to someone. Grandma said it was her choice. Emma got involved, and said that's not fair, that Marco's not even her 'real grandson', or even related to him by blood at all. They tried to argue, saying that as Dad's 'blood children', they have more right to the house. I got pissed at that and said. \"Look, Marco is Dad's eldest. He always will be, so just get over it and move on, okay?\" That caused Emma to start crying, and Jess left with her and Alex.\n\nI later got a text from Jess, telling me that she hopes that I'm proud of myself, because I made Emma feel inferior to Marco, and that I'm basically saying that Emma's blood connection to Dad means nothing.\n\nI didn't want to hurt Emma's feelings. We don't get along, but all I wanted to do was defend my brother, and it came off more as me saying that my Dad didn't love Emma.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704409494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yqwhz/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_that_my_brother_will/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is all BS that her mother is probably feeding her. What's important is how you, your grandmother, and your dad felt about Marco.", "NTA- Your brother is/was his son.
