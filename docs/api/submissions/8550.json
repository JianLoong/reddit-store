I get that it seems hypocritical, but the difference is that (AFAIK) you likely didn\u2019t grow up sharing beds with any of your straight female friends.

On average, the probability of this kind of platonic but extremely close bond between straight men and women (and men/women attracted to each other, in general) is quite rare. Part of this is the instinctive \"boys with boys\" \"girls with girls\" separation in school and how it shapes important childhood/high school friendships that last a lifetime; part is also that being openly part of a minority create a sense of community and strength with who is also part of it.
