{"id": 19232, "submission_id": "143lklv", "title": "AITA For not wanting to cut back my spending in order to afford my wife's therapy", "selftext": "My wife (38F) and I (39M) have been married for 8 years and have a 3-year-old son. My wife started seeing a therapist about 18-months ago to help with her mental health, she's struggled with anxiety, stress, and childhood trauma. For the first year or so, her therapy was partially covered under our insurance plan. But then the insurance company changed something which no longer covered that particular therapy group. It would still cover therapy, but it would have to be from a different provider.\n\nNeedless to say, it's gotten expensive. To the point that our monthly budget has to be adjusted in order to cover it. Our basics are still covered, but our savings and expendable income are definitely effected.\n\nWe've had many talks about this, but can't seem to come to an agreement. I want her to start looking for a therapist that would at least be partially covered by our insurance. She is refusing because she likes her therapist and they've been very helpful to her. I will admit, her mental health has improved and I'm very happy for her.\n\nI'm frustrated because pretty much all of the cutbacks to our spending is directly related to me. I like to golf and would usually go 2-3 weekends a month. But now, I've only been going maybe once a month. Sometimes once every 6 weeks. I also admit that golf is a rather expensive hobby, but it's pretty much the only hobby I have that I do just for myself.\n\nI also enjoy good whiskey and my wife got pissed when she found out I bought an expensive bottle the other day. It's not like I go through it fast, that bottle will be in the cabinet for 6 months. It started a fight about my spending and how I can't just be throwing money away on things like that if our budget is tight.\n\nThe fight came back to her refusing to look into a different therapist that could save us money. She got mad that I brought that up again and told me that she's not going to spend the time and energy to find a new therapist when she already has one she likes and is helping.\n\nShe said she doesn't want to cancel with her current therapist because she would probably have to be put on a waitlist if she wanted to go back. And that it could take her a long time to find a new therapist and would basically be starting from scratch with someone new and could possibly have to go through multiple therapists to find one she likes.\n\nI told her I'm tired of having to adjust my spending to accommodate her therapy cost when there is another solution available to us and that she could at least entertain the idea of finding a new therapist. That pissed her off even more and she straight up told me that her mental health is more important to our family than my \"fun money.\"\n\nShe said she's not going to look for a new therapist so I need to drop that idea and not bring it up again. She told me that me going golfing a few times less a year is not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things compared to her improved mental health.\n\nEDIT:  Ok, fine, I'm the asshole.  I will make more sacrifices to ensure that my wife is able to get the help she needs.  I will find other ways to deal with my own stress that aren't as impactful to the family financially.  You're all right, my wife's mental health is more important than my free time.

Other options are keep this one while going out to meet others.\n\nAll the Y T A are expecting OP to 100% compromise and wife 0%.  In reality, she has a lot she can give up but OP has bore all of it unfairly.", "Aside from trying the suggestion by user/dca\\_user (\"Has she tried for a NETWORK EXCEPTION or SINGLE CASE AGREEMENT? This way you\u2019re more likely to be able to afford the therapist because insurance company is required to pay more then.\"), three other options I can think of?\n\n1 - check and see if your total benefits package comes with an EAP (Employee Assistance Program). We have one at m job; there are (2) vendors that provide free therapy sessions, 5-8 times a year for each specific issue. IE, if I say I need help with anxiety or depression, I get 5 visits with one vendor and 8 with another. In the same calendar year, if I want help with...career counseling, that is another 5 and 8 sessions. Both have different networks, although there may be overlap in therapists. It could be a way for her to \"shop\" for a new therapist without losing her spot with her current one, and she could talk over any concerns with her current one also. \n\n2 - Divide up your \"fun money\" accounts proportionally or in a way that feels fair to both. IE, after ALL the joint bills + saving accounts are paid, how much is left? Include her therapy / all medical costs for both of you, including any therapy visits if you do find one you like.  Example: If there is $600 left over, how much is yours and how much is hers? If you split bills according to income, say 40/60, then do the same with the extra - and if something unexpected hits one month for a joint item, you both proportionally contribute from the \"fun\" money. If she can't afford nails/hair every 6 weeks as mentioned in comments, or you can't afford golf more than 1x a month, c'est la vie.   \n\n\n3 - See about an FSA or HSA (or your country's equivalent if not USA-based). Even if the therapist is out of network, it is still a valid medical expense. Contribute pre-tax dollars to an account that is then used to offset her therapy costs and lower the overall taxable income. The amount you bring home will be a bit lower, but you are still 'saving' $.  And even out of network, it should still be contributing to the household's deductible.   \n\n\n4 - Since golf/whiskey is part of your current mental health outlet, maybe do some research into other options you may like that are less cost prohibitive. Also, approach like an \"us vs mental demons\" problem with your wife. Stress how much you love seeing her in a more emotionally healthy state - and that you want to ensure you are taking equal care of your individual happiness as well. She knows you - does she know what you mentally \"get\" from golfing? Could she help you brainstorm other ways to find the same mental dopamine hit?  \n\nOverall good luck! And while I don't **think** Y-T-A for feeling financially restricted RE your coping mechanisms with the newly increased bills, you **could** be T-A if you approach it as a \"her\" problem that she is refusing to solve by finding a new therapist. As others have mentioned, finding a new therapist is a process, and requires a lot of mental energy, spoons, etc.  It might be different if your household was struggling to pay things like rent at the expense of an out-of-network provider, but not currently. If it does get to that point and she HAS to find a new one, def offer to help her with the mental load of shopping around, looking at reviews, and being a sounding board for initial consultations.

It might suck to switch, but if she applied for one now and changed her current appointments to biweekly while she set up a new one, the transition would be smoother. I mean, she's going weekly. My therapist is $125 an hour. That's $500 monthly. She still gets her nails and hair done and still goes to half her hobbies. The cutbacks are mainly from his side. She's being selfish, by the sounds of it.", "NTA\n\nI was ready to go with something different, but after reading everything, your wife has several hobbies that she is unwilling to compromise on. She claims that they help her unwind and relax, which is exactly why she won't give them up, but fails to see that you have yours for the same reason. Golf every six weeks and a bottle of whiskey twice a year is hardly even a big ask. She wants you to give up everything, but won't compromise or do the same herself. Her fun money is taking precedence over her therapy, and your fun money. She sounds like a real gem.", "This was a rough one for me. I know personally how it is to be comfortable with a therapist and have insurance changes. I spent 200 on one appointment and then had to look elsewhere. Never found a therapist that came close to how awesome that guy was. \n\nHowever, as a man of compromise, I think she could cut back to 2 times a month instead of weekly. If not, she's got to loosen up on her other activities as well. There needs to be a balance that doesn't exist currently. \n\nShe's been in therapy long enough to cut back. My ex wife insisted on running us into the ground financially with her habits and appointments. I often told her that her therapy might not be working if after 2 years she's so dependent on her therapist.

Yours should be just as important has hers.", "INFO: what hobbies does your wife have for herself?", "You and your wife should have the same amount for hobbies and self-care each month. She may need to cut back on some things. Therapy is heath care, but the other things are wants not needs.

Other than footwear you don't need to do that.", "NTA since you say she is unwilling to cut back on any of her fun activities and expects only you to do so. Asking you to give up everything you enjoy so she doesn't have to give up anything is not a reasonable ask.\n\nFinding a new therapist you like is hard, and I understand why she wouldn't want to switch, but something has to give.\n\nYou two should have EQUAL amounts of money allotted to fun stuff each month. Her therapy should not be included in her side of the total. You each may do what you like with your allotment. She can paint her own nails and use last year's hiking equipment so long as it is still in good shape, and if she doesn't want to do that, she's going to have to consider switching therapists.", "From the comments, I see she hadn't cut back on her hobbies, which she has several more of, nearly as much as you have. I say you shouldn't cut back anymore until she cuts back more to the point of being equal with you, then cut more as needed but keep it equal. NTA", "NAH\n\nAt the end of the day, your wife's mental health is a couple/family issue, so treating it is important and both of you need to make sacrifices. In this regard, I understand your wife asking you to cut some spending so she can continue therapy with a therapist she already trusts and whose treatment is working. On the other hand, your own personal mental health is important too, so hobbies are important in this regard.\n\nHowever, if only cutting a bottle of whiskey every 6 months + golfing once a month is enough to equilibrate your budget, it means you clearly have other things that can be cut/readjust to in your family. I would look into that first. I mean, cheap toilet paper does the same job as expensive one...", "My first inclination is NAH, yet. If your wife isn't cutting her \"fun money\" spending, then obviously that should be on the table. As well as looking for a therapist within network...but she shouldn't stop her treatment while she's on a waitlist, that just sounds like a shitty idea.

Wouldn't her therapist session be more important than her nails?

She can also cut back some of her own hobbies. If she were willing to also cut back, then asking him to cut back some make sense.", "After 18 months of weekly, it's very likely this could be reduced to bi-weekly without any major downsides.  I agree with your wife that she should not find a new therapist at this point though (if you've never tried to find a therapist that works for you... just trust us on this).  However, the frequency could be reduced.\n\nThat seems like it would be a reasonable compromise.\n\nTo me, others saying it's more important than golf is a little bit silly.  You need a way to unwind too.  And what is the cost of a nice bottle of whiskey... one therapy session?\n\nNAH.", "Unless your wife is still severely mentally ill, I am extremely confused as to why her therapist has not suggested they cut down on session frequency. \n\nFor context, I am a psychologist in private practice and I work with a mix of civilian clients (who generally have shit insurance) and military veterans (who are funded for unlimited sessions as long as I say they\u2019re needed). In general, weekly therapy is not supposed to persist for more than a few months (unless there are multiple serious mental illnesses). Even my vets with PTSD and MDD go down to biweekly sessions after about 6 months. With my civilian clients, we usually do monthly (biweekly AT MOST) because weekly sessions are just way too expensive. \n\nThe point of therapy is to teach coping skills and to encourage self-reflection so that clients get insight into where their difficulties come from and how to manage them. Your wife should\u2019ve learned many new skills by now. And if the therapist knows about the financial difficulties (which they should since it\u2019s a major stressor and relevant to your wife\u2019s well-being), then they should be suggesting that your wife reduce session frequency. That\u2019s what I would do if my client had come so far and was struggling to pay for sessions. \n\nAll that aside, I don\u2019t think that she should switch therapists if this one is working out (unless it turns out they\u2019re unethical in any way - then ditch them immediately). Studies show us that the greatest predictor of therapy outcomes is the therapeutic alliance. And it\u2019s *hard* to find a good fit. I\u2019m on therapist number 4 myself because the first 3 were poor fits (actually 2 were poor fits\u2026 the third one died \ud83d\ude2c) \n\nAnyway, assuming that your wife isn\u2019t seriously mentally ill or that we aren\u2019t missing any relevant info, I think that for *your* mental well-being, your wife needs to cut down on session frequency. She should avoid starting over with a new therapist, but she certainly shouldn\u2019t need to see her current one every week. You need to be able to afford your own interests and hobbies too, and it won\u2019t help anything if you end up in a depressive episode", "He mentions her hobbies in another comment and they do read to me as cheaper than golfing at a club and collecting expensive whiskey lol", "I see in the comments that she still managed to find the money for her to get her hair done and nails done.
