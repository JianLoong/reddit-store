I also have back pain due to an accident I had a year prior that left me with severe chronic back pain if I stand for too long. \n\nI got on the bus this morning to head to work and a big group of people (all family) get on the bus with a really young child. 2 of them had gotten on the bus with the child before me (pushed passed me to get on first which I found rude personally) and then I got on and sat down in an available seat. After about a minute of the 2 women and child standing trying to find a seat the kid wanted to sit in she wanted my seat. The woman came up to me asking me to move to a different seat because her kid wanted that seat. I told her no as there was plenty of seats (as you can imagine the bus isn\u2019t very busy at 1:30am) and I was already sat down. The kid started getting angry and the woman said \u201cbut you can just move my child wants this seat and she won\u2019t sit down anywhere else.\u201d Again I said no because I was already sat down and my back was in quite a bit of pain then the woman got angry with me said I was being rude and should just let her child sit there because that\u2019s where she wanted to sit. \n\nNow am I the AH for this because, if circumstances were different and the bus was full, I would\u2019ve been fine to give up my seat and sit next to someone else but because there was so many free seats and my back was in a lot of pain, I really didn\u2019t want to move if I didn\u2019t have to.", "created_utc": 1684289345, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jobye/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_seat_to_a_mum_and_her/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
