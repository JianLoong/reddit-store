Another over entitled parent teaching their child to behave like the world owes them a favour.", "NTA. The child can sit in any other seat the child doesn't need a specific seat just cause that's the seat they fancy. If I was on a mostly empty bus traveling with one of my nieces or nephews I'd give them a short time to choose a seat and then I'd choose for them.

She's absolutely acting entitled to something she isn't entitled to, and your back hurt.\n\n\nBut, she was out with family at 1:30, on public transit, and no one knows why. I can't imagine any situation where she'd want that to be the case, so there is likely some emergency or obligation. This kid should have been asleep and probably had a killer day.

Would you mind moving so she can sit here?\", and respect if they say no. Asking for something that helps your child be comfortable is fine, but that doesn't override anyone else's comfort.", "Please note I don\u2019t agree with the law I this case but it is the law.\n\nIn many places you actually don\u2019t have to give up your seat regardless of if your disabled or not. It\u2019s first come first serve.

It seemed like a family outing considering how many were together", "If she had told me there was a reason such as autism, ocd or any other special needs and she had asked me politely or like you said have gotten the kid to ask I would\u2019ve considered because I know it\u2019s hard raising a child with any of those disabilities. \nI chose not to move because my back was in a lot of pain, if it would\u2019ve been a day where I wasn\u2019t on my way to work and my back wasn\u2019t in agony I would\u2019ve considered swapping either way if she has asked nicely", "Then if she had said that I would\u2019ve sympathised with her.

I\u2019m talking a heavily pregnant person, 7 or 8 months along", "As a parent myself, I don\u2019t get why people seem to think their kids are entitled to whatever tf they want. I literally cannot even imagine asking someone to move seats on an empty bus. Even if my child was special needs, what good is it going to teach them? The world revolves around NO ONE, not one single human, no matter what. I just don\u2019t get why any parent would dare to act so entitled. I\u2019ve never seen this behavior myself but admittedly, I don\u2019t get out much. But I read and hear about this kind of crap all the time.", "This all makes sense. Listen, if I was OP, I may have moved because I'm conflict avoidant, but it probably would have helped to ask nicely. If the mum had been like \"I'm so sorry to bother you, but my child is being very picky - is there any way we could possibly sit in these seats?\" and hadn't been pushy before that, maybe OP would have moved. But also, OP can still say no and then the mum has to just move on and try and teach her kid about it.", "I would\u2019ve understood better if there was any underlying reason like autism or OCD. My partner has OCD and I completely understand the need for routine and having specific things but this was just straight up entitlement", "Not saying this is the case, but your comment made me think of jet lag. There were a few times when I was a kid I was up at that hour because we\u2019d traveled to a different country and my body hadn\u2019t adjusted yet.

Two surgeries later, including the last one being kidney removal, and I have pretty bad nerve pain. I\u2019ve heard so much bullshit about how I look young and healthy so I can\u2019t be in that much pain, and with the nerve pain it\u2019s \u201call in my head, it\u2019s not real pain\u201d. Once at the supermarket with my mum the worker had the audacity to tell me I should be carrying the bags not my mum and that young people don\u2019t help out their parents anymore! (I was 30).

So my Mum didn't actually know I had it until I was much older. She just did what she felt she had to, to make sure that whatever issues I had, I could still live a relatively normal life.

Women or men can be disabled or elderly, he picked the women exclusive option to hate on. Either he just doesn\u2019t care if people are in pain (which is not the case because he agrees with others being allowed priority seating) so the only other conclusion is that he doesn\u2019t believe a pregnant woman\u2019s pain is valid enough for him to get off his lazy ass. \n\nAnyone with a shred of empathy towards women would realise growing a whole human is incredibly hard."]}
