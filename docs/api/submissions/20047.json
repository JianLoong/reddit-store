And it makes me doubt the accuracy of your description of her reaction.  I have a feeling this wasn't the first time you ignored her house rules due to a lack of respect and possibly bigotry (antisemitism,  I'm guessing since their kosher rules require separated equipment for cooking different things).  If you can't handle her house rules,  don't visit her house.  YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou know the rules of the home. Period. It sounds like Tisha keeps Kosher, which means yes, things need to be kept separate. You can disagree with the household rules by not attending events. You cannot go in a disrespect their home because you don't like being inconvenienced. \n\nPlus, they make plenty of thermoses and other gadgets to keep your child's food warm.", "YTA It may not be a big deal to you, but it is to Tisha and you knew what you were doing would upset her. If she keeps kosher, which is what it sounds like based on your description, she may no longer consider the microwave kosher, and depending on how devout she is may replace the microwave you used.", "I\u2019m guessing Tisha is Jewish and she is keeping kosher. Hardcore Jews have double kitchens. Sinks, silverware, in this case a dishwasher, plates, you name it. Part of their religion says certain foods don\u2019t mix, that includes mixing utensils/anything that touches certain other foods. The biggest example is dairy and meat. Something along the lines of \u201cnot cooking a baby animal in its mother's milk.\u201d My best friend, who is an ambivalent Jew and lives in the US, will order a cheeseburger but make sure the meat and cheese just don\u2019t touch (so like lettuce in between) Her dad tells her this is cheating and reminds her she shouldn\u2019t do that and we laugh about it, but for heavily practicing Jewish people this is no joke. When I have stayed in Israel with her orthodox Jewish relatives, I\u2019ve seen one side of a kitchen be a mirror image of the other. Double everything. While this may sound ridiculous or excessive to you, it\u2019s kind of like serving something containing animal products to a vegetarian in their own house and not thinking it\u2019s a big deal. Making a genuine mistake, NTA. But not apologizing profusely afterwards or getting defensive, YTA.", "You are being incredibly disrespectful and dismissive of her religion. Please apologize and get educated about her religion and dietary rules. You should have used your words and asked for guidance if the microwave you were directed to use wasn\u2019t working.

Your SIL is keeping kosher, which is why she has different utensils and such in her kitchen.  Maybe it's \"just religion\" to you, but to Tisha it's a way of life that you completely dismiss, disregard, and disrespect, in *her* home.  You don't have to believe in religion at all, that's your right, but it does not give you the right to belittle and disrespect someone else's religion.  Do your brother and SIL a favour and stay out of their home if you can't be bothered to respect it.", "Yta. You know you are. Kosher kitchen are a huge deal. You went to a home, knowing they wouldn\u2019t have something your kid could eat, brought a meal you knew would be an issue, and decided to disregard her entire religion and beliefs set, because you didn\u2019t want to ask for help with the microwave **they specifically keep because they understand not everyone eats kosher** It\u2019s not like you had no idea about this.

You knew it was not acceptable to use the main microwave, and you knew this would violate Tisha\u2019s religion- it was unbelievably disrespectful to do that. \n\nThat being said, they should have made sure the second microwave was functioning, knowing they were hosting people who would need it. \n\nBut seriously- how hard it to say \u201chey, the microwave isn\u2019t working, can you help me figure out a way to heat this up?\u201d", "YTA. You knowingly did something that would instigate a fight with Tisha in her own home.

The reason for accommodation is not relevant. Both require accommodation.

It's not just a quick easy fix if you hold strict kosher, which is one of many likely reasons why Tisha was so upset (if OP's description can even be believed, since they very clearly do not like or respect her or her religious practices at all, to the point that they come across as blatantly anti-Semetic).", "OP can't kasher the microwave (or anything else). Given that, by strictest practice, anything cooked 100% by a non-Jew is trayif\\* (not kosher) and renders the cookware trayif also, \"cleaning\" the microwave isn't going to wash. That's also why she was het up about the plates: ceramics can't be kashered at all.\n\nAnd this wasn't an egg mayo sandwich (which, yeah, unsupervised food but it's difficult to make \"actively\" trayif and doesn't contain meat or dairy). It was trayif meat - I would consider that to have unkoshered anything it touched, and I'm not that fussed about these things. (I keep my practices to myself and neither eat meat in company nor serve it to others).\n\nAdd that to the general tone of the post - \"fundamentalist religion\", scrupulously avoiding saying \"Jewish\" etc - and I think OP is antisemitic and did it the second they had an excuse.\n\n\\*doesn't apply to things like carrot sticks - supposed-to-be-raw food is fine.", "\"Now I do think that a good way to solve this would be OP koshering the microwave\" .. quite an investment, possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely: a new microwave, new pots, new dishes - and since you likely can not replace one plate, a whole new set, ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is an AH .. she is unlikely to want to make good on that.", "Not at all. They knew the non-kosher microwave was broken and didn't bother telling OP. They should apologize to OP for being idiots.

Why? Because if I was stupid enough not to warn someone about something they needed to know, then the fallout from that idiocy would be my fault and mine alone.

They knew, absolutely knew, that the microwave was broken. \n\nAnd to be clear, they didn't do what they wanted. What they wanted was to cook their child's food the way they expected to cook it.

I fortunately knew very few who were so disrespectful of others while demanding respect for themselves.", "I'm not assuming.

No one has used the dishwasher in over 18 months. It's entirely possible that it could be broken, and I would have no idea, since I don't use it, nor do I \"test it out\" every month to make sure it's working, as there is no reason to test it out. The dishwasher could be broken right now and I wouldn't know, but if guests came over and asked to use it, we might discover it broken. Would I be a \"major asshole\" for not \"telling them\" that it was broken?\n\nHowever - that's a bit of a spurious comparison on my part, as OP's brother SHOULD know that his sister (OP) has a child with dietary issues, and since he knows the microwave could be a necessary tool for OP during her visits to his home, he SHOULD have been responsible to test and repair said microwave before his sister and her child visited, as he KNOWS of the child's dietary issues.", "Why are you interpreting Tisha's actions in the least charitable way possible and interpreting OP in the best way?

Why is my anti-semitism sense tingling?", "I was trying to be kind, but yeah, it reeks of antisemitism.", "If the options are Halal or nothing, they will go with Halal as the slaughtering process is almost identical save for Imam vs rabbi. But strictly kosher Jews will check all the labels to make sure what has been manufactured in a facility with dairy, etc.", "Yep. People who keep strictly kosher only eat at certified kosher restaurants. There are different kosher agencies who award certifications, and these certificates will be displayed prominently in their window. They also employ someone called a mashgiach who supervises the kitchen to ensure all the rules are being followed.", "First of all, some people only keep kosher inside the home and will eat at non-kosher restaurants. It's whatever, but not uncommon. Secondly, sometimes I will meet people at no -kosher restaurants but won't eat anything prepared there, only unflavored beer/whiskey and water. Third, some people won't eat meat or dairy at a restaurant but will eat vegetarian/vegan options, although that is technically also a kashrut problem, but a somewhat less serious one. And finally, in order to be kosher a restaurant must be certified by a local Kashrut agency that provides supervision and guidance ensure compliance with halachic standards. There is usually am organization that provides people looking for kosher places with a list of the certified options in the area. There are generally not many options, though. I believe in the city I live in (pretty high up on the list of biggest American cities, though not at the top) there are maybe five kosher restaurants.", "Ding ding. How are people not getting this from the original post?!", "Are you sure they actually KNEW the microwave was broken?  It's in the basement and they don't use it for their food-- how exactly would they know it's broken?", "Are you OP?", "Maybe they didn\u2019t know it was broken? \n\nEither way, I don\u2019t understand what makes people think that it\u2019s ok to disrespect someone\u2019s home like that. Being kosher is a BIG DEAL. Dietary restrictions in some religions are a VERY BIG DEAL\u2026. So clearly if they re-did their entire kitchen to follow those restrictions, it is a BIG DEAL to them. \n\nAnd OP knew the rules of the house\u2026. The fact that she didn\u2019t even ask or talk to her brother or his future wife about it, or asked for an alternative solution and just decided on her own she\u2019s gonna disrespect their home because she is being inconvenienced is disgusting. \n\nWhether your have a child that has special needs or not, it does not give you the right to disrespect other people, their home and their religion because you are being inconvenienced.  \n\nOP bluntly just disregarded all the rules she knew were a big deal and in place for a reason, again without even speaking to her brother or future sister in law,  and ya\u2019ll think that\u2019s ok? \n\nLol the entitlement on this sub is so wild.", "C\u2019mon! Did you read at all how cynically OP describes Tisha, her religious beliefs and the Kosher laws she keeps? It is evident that OP has no respect for any of it.", "We don\u2019t know if they knew OP needed the microwave and we also don\u2019t know if they knew the microwave was busted.", "It\u2019s Tisha\u2019s house and the boundaries have been made very clear. OP could have gone home, or at least ASKED for some kind of accommodation first. \n\nIt is absolutely wild to me how comfortable some of y\u2019all are with disrespecting someone else\u2019s home and religious practices, but I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised by blatant antisemitism in this day and age.", "YTA- OP sounds hostile and bigoted toward her SIL's religious practice; she knew what she was doing in dismissing her by traipsing into her kitchen like that. She should buy her a new microwave and relegate that one to the basement or simply not visit there anymore if she can't muster a bit of decency.", "Yeah either she grew up Charedi/Chasidic or OP is just antisemitic.", "Holy cow. I had no idea just how little I knew about what \"kosher\" meant. I was 100% thinking this crazy lady is a total asshole over such a small thing, but I actually feel terrible now.", "mhm, okay! sorry i just never heard that before.", "Sandwiches, fruit, yoghurt, the list of foods that are not heated is endless. OP did not say that the child only eats foods that are served warm.", "Why did it take so long to find this comment???\n\nThe hosts probably don't use the secondary microwave oven often, if at all. If the hosts were previously informed that the microwave was broken, there's a pretty big chance that they genuinely forgot that it needed to be replaced since they never/rarely use it.\n\nAlso, the person who used it last may not have informed the hosts that it wasn't working correctly/stopped working/whatever....so they may not have even known that it was broken. And I certainly wouldn't expect the hosts to run down and check to make sure it's working before every get-together because that's just ridiculous.\n\nShit happens, it definitely sucks for the parent and kid, but they can't just go and trample all over someone else's stuff especially when they **KNOW** it's off-limits. They effectively \"broke\" the kitchen microwave...the hosts cannot use it as-is; it either needs to be fixed (re-koshered), or replaced.\n\nThey needed to ask before doing anything. The hosts might have been able to help find a solution.", "Love when people play the oppression olympics", "Oh, look at her comments, she's absolutely antisemitic and doesn't respect Judaism whatsoever.", "not to defend OP but i dont think there is anything wrong with defining ultra-orthodoxy as fundamentalism", "No reason to be kind to antisemites.", "I'm mostly shocked that someone that is so strictly kosher married outside their religion. That's unusual.", "they do eat meat, but I think since it's halal then they let it pass?\n\nUs muslims are also allowed to eat their meat so I don't know if there's a verse in the torah for reciprocity or something", "OP is being deliberately vague about the fact that her STB SIL is Jewish because once you figure that out it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s antisemitic.", "I think that secondary concern is exactly the larger issue. OP dismisses the Kosher rules of that household openly.", "But to some extent it is the question at hand as her dismissive attitude obviously informed her behavior in this little drama.", "Yeah, so many people have mentioned Tisha and hubs should have let the OP know the downstairs microwave was broken-- yet IMHO it's HIGHLY DOUBTFUL they knew that (if it was even indeed broken) as they don't use it.  I have a coffeemaker in my studio at the uni--but I'm on sabbatical so haven't used it since last December. Does it work?  It worked the last time I used it so I'm \"assuming\" it does, but if it doesn't how would I know?  It's kind of like Schrodinger's Keurig-- it might be dead, it might be alive, it might be a cat.", "And yet she married outside her religion? Unusual to say the least\n\nI can't find anywhere that says she is following kosher requirements though tbh", "A very long time ago when I was a teen, I babysat for a family with a kosher kitchen. My level of anxiety that I was going to ruin their kitchen was through the roof. They were very kind about things and the five year old was extremely helpful but I tried only babysitting when I wouldn't have to feed the kids or use the kitchen.\n\nThe thing that jumps out at me is if she used the plates and utensils that she wasn't supposed to use in addition to the microwave, that means she took them off the plates that she was supposed to use when she had a problem with the downstairs microwave. Not saying she shouldn't have asked for help or that it would have been better for the kosher status of the microwave, but if it has really been about heating the food and feeding her son, why wouldn't she have brought the nonkosher plate that she must have placed the food on to the other microwave? \n\nShe was intentional in her disrespect and disdain for the household and SIL. \n\nOp is YTA.", "Or both!", "I'm curious if the brother converted. Completely remodeling for a kosher kitchen is no small feat, I wonder if it's just because he loves Tisha or if he genuinely cares about kashrut", "We don't know that Tisha is ultra-orthodox. You can keep strict Kosher without being ultra-orthodox, or even any kind of orthodox. And it sounds like Tisha isn't Orthodox Jewish, because A. It's extremely unlikely for an Orthodox Jew to date anyone who isn't an Orthodox Jew, and B. It sounds like OP's brother and Trisha are already living together outside of wedlock which is a HUGE no-no in Orthodox Judaism.", "No kidding. OP is a raging racist, and an absolutely vile person. The disdainful comments towards her SILs religion are literally making my skin crawl.", "Not a big shock. If she grew up this way it would be hard for her to do otherwise. I was in a couples group for Jews and non Jews who either wanted to get married or were married (my partner is Jewish, but not observant). One couple was a same sex couple (one observant Jew one, not Jewish). The non Jewish woman thought it was strange that her fiance wanted to keep a Kosher kitchen because she thought that since they were both lesbians her partner would not want to be \"so legalistic\" about the Kosher kitchen. The observant Jewish partner said she had been Kosher her entire life and couldn't imagine doing otherwise.", "In Judaism, only meat slaughtered and prepared by Jews is considered kosher, so there is no reciprocity per se for foodstuffs.", "Yeah it's obvious to anyone who knows anything about Jews but OP was banking on people not knowing anything about Jews I guess.", ">**They knew the child needed his food heated with the microwave.**   \n>  \n>Did they?  There's no mention that the child only eats microwaved food.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**They didn't bother to tell OP that the microwave was broken**  \n>  \n>Did they know that? It's a microwave in the basement that the family doesn't use themselves.  How would they have known it was broken?", "I couldn't imagine being that fucking ignorant and rude about someone else's religion.....IN THEIR HOME.  It makes that a million times worse.", "Missed that bit in my initial read. I withdraw any thoughts OP was just in need of understanding. She's just being a jerk.", "Op is a HUGE AH for that. \n\nKeeping Kosher is no joke, and the process to make things Kosher again can take forever. \n\nThe way she\u2019s so dismissive and insisting things don\u2019t matter because they don\u2019t matter to her is maddening.", "Also describing Judaism and Kashrut as 'fundamentalist religion' is bullish\\*t. Just because there are rules that are different from yours doesn't mean you can just diminish them via your ignorance, OP. YTA.", "And omg, I just read some of her comments. There is so much more going on than a 'miscommunication' I stand well corrected.", "That\u2019s on OP to deal with.", "Exactly! If it's a non-Kosher microwave and they keep kosher upstairs, chances are, they didn't check to see if the non-kosher microwave worked.", "Then she needs to leave the house to get him something else to ear", "I have a Catholic brother-in-law who has a strict kosher kitchen who did not convert, and its a combo of loving my sister and also not really caring much about how the home is run. He's a doctor, she's the homemaker, and it's never been an issue.", "Yeah reading through OP\u2019s comments gives me the vibe that at the very least they\u2019re the type of person who takes selfies at a holocaust memorial.", "The changing the kitchen to have two sets of appliances is a dead giveaway.", "I was coming to say exact same thing!\n\nEither way she's got issues.", "I think this is the biggest point of contention for me. Keeping kosher does not make someone a fundamentalist Jew. Maybe Tisha is ex-Haredi, maybe not.", "What makes a religion fundamentalist?", "OP then tipped their fedora and thanked carl degrasse dawkins", "Did I miss that or is it in comments? Yikes!", "Right, but if it's nuggets Tisha or her husband could've wrapped them in foil and heated them in the oven.  Had they been told there's an issue with the microwave.  Jews do actually have thousands of years of experience dealing with needs of non-kosher-keeping guests.", "I do this all the time because once I worked a job where we had to use this old, falling apart printer. It wasn\u2019t working properly and someone said kick it. So, I did-not hard, just a light jokey tap- it worked! \ud83d\ude02", "Op doesn't state whether or not they knew that that microwave was broken or not. So we can't really judge them for being AH here when we don't know if they knew about it or not. And imo even if they knew, what would it cost op to just go and ask them about it? I'm sure they could work out a solution that way, but op decided to be an AH and use the other one anyways. Surely it's common sense if the microwave isn't working just to go ask someone? Op knew the rules and still decided to disobey them, causing a lot of issues. No matter what op is an AH and whether or not Tisha and her brother are AH is unknown because we don't have enough information. And anyways who's to know if they knew that op needed the microwave anyways.", "I think, for me, as an atheist (hence why I specified *ethnically* Jewish), it comes down to just... basic respect. \n\nLike, as long as one's religious beliefs aren't harming anybody--which, despite OP's victim complex, keeping kosher *isn't*--I will make every effort to respect those people's beliefs when I am inside their homes and act accordingly. I will not bring pork into a halal home. I will similarly not bring non-kosher foods in a kosher home. I will not dig into my meal loudly while my hosts are trying to say Grace. \n\nIt's not my house. I don't get to dictate what is and isn't reasonable for people to do in their own homes in terms of religious practice (again, as long as it is not causing anyone else harm). \n\nOP's whole attitude about Tisha is disgusting and bigoted. In their post and every comment they try to argue that Tisha's religious practices are irrational, controlling, and rooted in untreated mental illness. They refuse to make *any* effort to respect Tisha or her religious beliefs *in her own home*. It is not that hard to find kosher foods suitable even for a child with sensory issues and specific dietary needs. It is not that hard to find kosher chicken nuggets in the shape of dinosaurs that taste literally exactly the same as the non-kosher Dino nuggets. It is not that hard to ask what one should do when the microwave and dishware designated for their use is unavailable or nonfunctional. OP *deliberately* chose not to do any of those things because they could not be bothered to put a modicum of effort into even *pretending* to respect Tisha, her religion, or her home, and that is absolutely abhorrent, narcissistic, bigoted behavior.", "And like \"food that Tisha doesn't approve\" as if she's just a crazy controlling person instead of literally only allowing kosher food. Smh", "In OPs comments", "Interestingly, I was thinking the same thing\u2026", "That was my thought too. We aren\u2019t a single organism.

I\u2019m glad it seems most of her in-laws are a little more respectful.", "YES. They\u2019re not picky, they\u2019re not prissy, they\u2019re not spoiled or entitled. They\u2019re not choosing to be difficult and are distressed too.

Rock on, just put food in your body. Therapeutic progress takes time, bodies and brains need fuel.", "OP really should buy them a new microwave, though.", "Ikr. My oldest brother is autistic. I have watched him blend turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, and other thanksgiving fixins into a slurry and then say \"it all goes in the same place.\" I'll be damned if someone tries to tell me all autistic people would eat that, because absolutely the fuck not!!
