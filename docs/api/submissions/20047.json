And it makes me doubt the accuracy of your description of her reaction.  I have a feeling this wasn't the first time you ignored her house rules due to a lack of respect and possibly bigotry (antisemitism,  I'm guessing since their kosher rules require separated equipment for cooking different things).  If you can't handle her house rules,  don't visit her house.  YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou know the rules of the home. Period. It sounds like Tisha keeps Kosher, which means yes, things need to be kept separate. You can disagree with the household rules by not attending events. You cannot go in a disrespect their home because you don't like being inconvenienced. \n\nPlus, they make plenty of thermoses and other gadgets to keep your child's food warm.", "YTA It may not be a big deal to you, but it is to Tisha and you knew what you were doing would upset her. If she keeps kosher, which is what it sounds like based on your description, she may no longer consider the microwave kosher, and depending on how devout she is may replace the microwave you used.", "I\u2019m guessing Tisha is Jewish and she is keeping kosher. Hardcore Jews have double kitchens. Sinks, silverware, in this case a dishwasher, plates, you name it. Part of their religion says certain foods don\u2019t mix, that includes mixing utensils/anything that touches certain other foods. The biggest example is dairy and meat. Something along the lines of \u201cnot cooking a baby animal in its mother's milk.\u201d My best friend, who is an ambivalent Jew and lives in the US, will order a cheeseburger but make sure the meat and cheese just don\u2019t touch (so like lettuce in between) Her dad tells her this is cheating and reminds her she shouldn\u2019t do that and we laugh about it, but for heavily practicing Jewish people this is no joke. When I have stayed in Israel with her orthodox Jewish relatives, I\u2019ve seen one side of a kitchen be a mirror image of the other. Double everything. While this may sound ridiculous or excessive to you, it\u2019s kind of like serving something containing animal products to a vegetarian in their own house and not thinking it\u2019s a big deal. Making a genuine mistake, NTA. But not apologizing profusely afterwards or getting defensive, YTA.", "You are being incredibly disrespectful and dismissive of her religion. Please apologize and get educated about her religion and dietary rules. You should have used your words and asked for guidance if the microwave you were directed to use wasn\u2019t working.

Your SIL is keeping kosher, which is why she has different utensils and such in her kitchen.  Maybe it's \"just religion\" to you, but to Tisha it's a way of life that you completely dismiss, disregard, and disrespect, in *her* home.  You don't have to believe in religion at all, that's your right, but it does not give you the right to belittle and disrespect someone else's religion.  Do your brother and SIL a favour and stay out of their home if you can't be bothered to respect it.", "Yta. You know you are. Kosher kitchen are a huge deal. You went to a home, knowing they wouldn\u2019t have something your kid could eat, brought a meal you knew would be an issue, and decided to disregard her entire religion and beliefs set, because you didn\u2019t want to ask for help with the microwave **they specifically keep because they understand not everyone eats kosher** It\u2019s not like you had no idea about this.

You knew it was not acceptable to use the main microwave, and you knew this would violate Tisha\u2019s religion- it was unbelievably disrespectful to do that. \n\nThat being said, they should have made sure the second microwave was functioning, knowing they were hosting people who would need it. \n\nBut seriously- how hard it to say \u201chey, the microwave isn\u2019t working, can you help me figure out a way to heat this up?\u201d", "YTA. You knowingly did something that would instigate a fight with Tisha in her own home.

The reason for accommodation is not relevant. Both require accommodation. I imagine if someone told you they wouldn\u2019t accommodate your son cause they\u2019re tired and you should just suck it up you\u2019d be outraged.

Ok.", ">Which religion allows you to go off on a parent who's awaiting the diagnosis of their child?\n\nI just want to point this out again.", "I wrote it somewhere else:\n\n*Which religion allows you to go off on a parent who's awaiting the diagnosis of their child?* \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think OP's behavior sucks, I think OP should apologize and then probably find a way around those family meetings at Tisha's house, but how the fuck does Tisha get to be the completely innocent angel here? Because it is a religion, isn't that true?", "OP knew that there was supposed to be a way to feed her child. The non-kosher microwave was in the basement. It was broken. They knew it was broken and didn't bother to tell her. At that point, is the child supposed to starve because they don't want to be without their microwave for a day? Kashering a microwave takes a few minutes to clean, 24 hours of it being idle, and then a few minutes boiling water inside the microwave to steam the inside. The kashering is then complete and the microwave is now kosher. OMG how horrible for Tisha!", "And good she planned to microwave, but in a container she wouldn\u2019t put in the microwave.", "I absolutely take my previous comment. I read the very last comment that shows up and that was enough. I\u2019m not even remotely Jewish or Muslim. But my Vape Shop guy is Muslim. I could never imagine bringing something into his shop not even his home that he doesn\u2019t like. And talking about his religion. The way she\u2019s been talking about it was, I couldn\u2019t do that. I didn\u2019t think it was going to be that bad. That was awful. I wonder how she\u2019d feel about my paganism and my veganism due to paganism.", "Okay! Thank you!", "You are arguing on nearly every comment. Are you OP?", "**Your anti-semitism is clouding your mind.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP could just have ASKED them to help her heat the food - then none of this would have happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead - because she is antisemitic like you and wanted to ddisrespect her host's religion - caused thousands of dollars of damage to her hosts.", "It depends how sensitive the kid is. Some wouldn\u2019t accept different chicken nuggets but some would accept any chicken nuggets, even with autism and GERD.", "Thanks for your reply. Well, I honestly think OP would have a problem with every religious rule in this situation, which I would have too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then I wouldn't enter the damn kitchen (or the house from the beginning) and just cook my food ANYWAYS. \n\n  \nJust because I don't like a religion, doesn't mean I can act respectful towards it in the house of those practicing it.", "You seem really invested in this story, is that you OP? \n\nEveryone here telling OP she's an AH, just accept it", "upvote, because it's funny\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTisha is settling down. With the brother of your wife.", "Ah yes, you're right, my apologies. Thank you. I shouldn't read AITA at 4am XD\n\nIt seems like there really aren't any winners in OP's situation at all and it kinda sucks for everyone. :(", "Could you just take your antisemitism elsewhere?", "No, the first thing you think is \"I better go let them know the microwave is broken and see what else we can do\". If someone's toilet isn't flushing I don't just go shit in another toilet and not mention it because they're not a plumber. You're reaching so hard you're going to dislocate your shoulder.", "Tisha and her husband may have simply forgotten to tell her the microwave was broken. OP knows how important Tisha\u2019s religion is to her and knew the house rules. She should have tracked down the hosts and asked how to handle heating up her child\u2019s lunch. Simple as that.", "Yeah, you think the people would know how to make their own microwave work. Seeing as it\u2019s their microwave.", "Your excuses are irrelevant. Follow the rules of the household as a guest and if you can\u2019t, leave. Such an entitled take.\n\nThe fact that OP didn\u2019t even ask just tells me exactly what type of person they are.", "Yes? It\u2019s not OPs house. OP is welcome to explain to everyone why they have to leave. Why is that such a strange thing to do?", "You are assuming, they knew it in advance without a single proof of it. And the posts say, OP had no microwave safe container. And no clean fork. So SIL has to get a plan B for one of her guests, but OP is fully depending on plates and sets of her brother?", "They told her how to make it work. She either didn\u2019t listen or didn\u2019t follow through. Either way, Tisha didn\u2019t cause the issue.", "Nah, people don't get to use their children's (potential) diagnosis as an excuse for their own bad behavior. OP was clearly aware that the upstairs microwave was off limits. \n\nIt doesn't matter what reason there is for a rule. It's a rule in someone else's home, and the polite thing to do is be respectful of that. \n\nAutistic or not, what kind of example is OP setting for the son? That it's okay to do whatever you want because of your diagnosis? That's going to go terribly once he's older.", "I think you are missing some of the language op is using to try and manipulate the situation. Especially in the comments. Like where she says *I basically did that* when told to hit the door. She either did what they said or she didn\u2019t, there\u2019s no way to *basically* try something, then not ask for help. She\u2019s also said that her and her husband have decided Tisha has ocd because Tisha wants her boundaries to be expected. Op had options. She could have asked for help. She could have ordered food. She could have asked someone to order food. She could have gone to the store. She could have asked someone to go to the store. She could have brought something not frozen. Instead she denied her sister in law the basic decency of asking for help, because *she* decided that Tisha is mentally ill and needs to cater her home to a woman who hates her and to a child that isn\u2019t even hers. No one said the kid had to starve. Op did this specially because she hates Tisha, and refuses to even acknowledge that she\u2019s even a little bit wrong. Her child was not going to starve to death while an alternative plan was made.", "The lede is often buried in AITA. I used to design kosher kitchens in NYC -- complex but always beautiful. I worked for an Israeli contractor at the time and his wife was a chef who cooked kosher. Our office was kosher, and we respected that..primarily because his wife would cook us lunch daily. Such sweet folks.\n\nAdding, she keeps saying SIL has OCD because she keeps kosher.... I just...  how fucking rude", "Worrying about her child\u2019s dietary needs does not make her anti-Semitic. It just makes her ignorant.", "Tisha, you don't have to come in to argue your point. You know you're wrong. Everyone telling OP she's an AH likely didn't see where you disregarded your soon-to-be nephew's dietary restrictions. Just accept it, Tisha.", "You are absolutely right. So when you have a kid coming over that needs to use a specific microwave, and that microwave is broken, you wouldn't just let them come over and THEN tell them \"oh, by the way, you can't cook your food.\" No, you would tell them beforehand. Right? I mean that's what you meant, right? RIGHT???", "OP may have simply forgotten that the kitchen microwave was kosher. Tisha and her husband know how important OP's child is to her and knew she needed that microwave. The hosts should have called OP to let her know so that OP could bring an appropriate meal. Simple as that.", "What type of person invites family over, with a child that has specific dietary needs, to their home and then just blatantly disregards those needs.", "So you think it's okay to disrespect your family's dietary restrictions, but ***not*** respect your family's dietary restrictions. Got it. How hypocritical of you.", "No, they told her afterwards that it usually works if you bang on it. What they should have done, knowing the microwave was broken, was to let OP know, since they KNEW she would need the microwave, and because when you bang on something to get it to work temporarily, that means it's broken and should be repaired or replaced, and likely will stop working altogether at the worst time.\n\nTisha and her soon-to-be husband should have let OP know so that she could plan accordingly. They didn't. They literally caused the issue.", "Religion or not, what kind of example is Tisha setting? I think she didn't handled the situation well,  yes. I think OP's son's condition and the mental stress that comes with it for OP should be taken into account.\n\nI also think every religion should put charity and trying to understand those around you right before *I'm not allowed to touch dead chicken.*", "I just looked up like kosher kitchens. Too much kitchen for me. But they\u2019re beautiful. I mean I know at some point when I start eating vegan fully, my boyfriend does not eat vegan. So I\u2019ll probably have a couple of dishes and things are separate for me. I couldn\u2019t imagine somebody coming over and just cooking meat on something, but I ask her not to. Especially if there are other things that they can use. I just it\u2019s appalling. But this has encouraged me to talk to my Vape Shop guy a little bit more about his religion so I can understand it a little bit better. I\u2019m hoping that OP will grow up and see that they\u2019re wrong but from the comments it doesn\u2019t look like they will.", "KNOWINGLY going behind the hosts back to ruin their kosher kitchen because she does not like their religious needs DOES make her an anti-semitic AH.", "You sound incredibly immature. While I agree that they should\u2019ve said something if they knew that does not mean OP could not have been an adult and said something.", "They didn't. They had a microwave and bowls for her to use. They said sometimes it needs fiddling before it works. Which OP would have known, if she'd bothered to ask. Just asking for help in this situation is 5th grade level problem solving skills. OP is simply entitled.", "One person being inconsiderate doesn\u2019t give you the right to do the same. \n\nWhen your argument hinges on using whatsboutisms, there is no argument.", "We just differ on whether we think the home owner has any extra moral rights in their own home. \n\nPersonally I think you should respect the rules of the household, I guess you don\u2019t. \n\nWe will just have to agree to disagree.", "Charity and respecting your neighbors are huge parts of Judaism. However, it is not too much to ask that ones religion be respected in their own home. \n\nTaking religion out of it, her sister in law had a boundary that she intentionally broke. It doesn't matter how arbitrary the boundary is to others.\n\nThe example that Tisha is setting is standing up for herself. OP had half a dozen other options before just using the kosher kitchen. Mainly, asking them! It's not that hard to say hey your microwave is broken can you help?", "That\u2019s not what she did. You\u2019re adding your own feelings in there. She heated up her child food because the other microwave is broken. It was not intentional to be an asshole unless there\u2019s some other posts or comments that make it that way. She was ignorant in how important it is. Most people who have not experienced with kosher mean don\u2019t understand how important it is. Nowhere in here does it say that she does not like their religion. Stop adding in things to make yourself feel better.", "Not fiddling. It was broken, but banging it might make it work. She literally stated that if they had told her it was broken, which they absolutely should have considering her child's dietary needs, she would have brought something else.", "Except it doesn't hinge on whataboutisms. Did they not invite a family over with a child who had dietary restrictions and not bother to tell them that the microwave they would need to use was broken? It would seem you do not understand what the word whataboutism means.", "We just differ on whether we think the home owner has any extra moral obligation in their own home.\n\nPersonally, I think you should respect your nephew with a medical dietary restriction. I guess you don't.\n\nWe will just have to agree to disagree."]}
