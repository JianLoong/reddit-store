And it makes me doubt the accuracy of your description of her reaction.  I have a feeling this wasn't the first time you ignored her house rules due to a lack of respect and possibly bigotry (antisemitism,  I'm guessing since their kosher rules require separated equipment for cooking different things).  If you can't handle her house rules,  don't visit her house.  YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou know the rules of the home. Period. It sounds like Tisha keeps Kosher, which means yes, things need to be kept separate. You can disagree with the household rules by not attending events. You cannot go in a disrespect their home because you don't like being inconvenienced. \n\nPlus, they make plenty of thermoses and other gadgets to keep your child's food warm.", "YTA It may not be a big deal to you, but it is to Tisha and you knew what you were doing would upset her. If she keeps kosher, which is what it sounds like based on your description, she may no longer consider the microwave kosher, and depending on how devout she is may replace the microwave you used.", "I\u2019m guessing Tisha is Jewish and she is keeping kosher. Hardcore Jews have double kitchens. Sinks, silverware, in this case a dishwasher, plates, you name it. Part of their religion says certain foods don\u2019t mix, that includes mixing utensils/anything that touches certain other foods. The biggest example is dairy and meat. Something along the lines of \u201cnot cooking a baby animal in its mother's milk.\u201d My best friend, who is an ambivalent Jew and lives in the US, will order a cheeseburger but make sure the meat and cheese just don\u2019t touch (so like lettuce in between) Her dad tells her this is cheating and reminds her she shouldn\u2019t do that and we laugh about it, but for heavily practicing Jewish people this is no joke. When I have stayed in Israel with her orthodox Jewish relatives, I\u2019ve seen one side of a kitchen be a mirror image of the other. Double everything. While this may sound ridiculous or excessive to you, it\u2019s kind of like serving something containing animal products to a vegetarian in their own house and not thinking it\u2019s a big deal. Making a genuine mistake, NTA. But not apologizing profusely afterwards or getting defensive, YTA.", "You are being incredibly disrespectful and dismissive of her religion. Please apologize and get educated about her religion and dietary rules. You should have used your words and asked for guidance if the microwave you were directed to use wasn\u2019t working.

How would you feel if she came into your house, broke your rules and did something to trigger your child\u2019s sensory issues and then claimed you were being OCD?\n\nYTA.", "YTA, and a gigantic one at that.  Your SIL is keeping kosher, which is why she has different utensils and such in her kitchen.  Maybe it's \"just religion\" to you, but to Tisha it's a way of life that you completely dismiss, disregard, and disrespect, in *her* home.  You don't have to believe in religion at all, that's your right, but it does not give you the right to belittle and disrespect someone else's religion.  Do your brother and SIL a favour and stay out of their home if you can't be bothered to respect it.", "Yta. You know you are. Kosher kitchen are a huge deal. You went to a home, knowing they wouldn\u2019t have something your kid could eat, brought a meal you knew would be an issue, and decided to disregard her entire religion and beliefs set, because you didn\u2019t want to ask for help with the microwave **they specifically keep because they understand not everyone eats kosher** It\u2019s not like you had no idea about this.

You knew it was not acceptable to use the main microwave, and you knew this would violate Tisha\u2019s religion- it was unbelievably disrespectful to do that. \n\nThat being said, they should have made sure the second microwave was functioning, knowing they were hosting people who would need it. \n\nBut seriously- how hard it to say \u201chey, the microwave isn\u2019t working, can you help me figure out a way to heat this up?\u201d", "YTA. You knowingly did something that would instigate a fight with Tisha in her own home.

The reason for accommodation is not relevant. Both require accommodation.

It's not just a quick easy fix if you hold strict kosher, which is one of many likely reasons why Tisha was so upset (if OP's description can even be believed, since they very clearly do not like or respect her or her religious practices at all, to the point that they come across as blatantly anti-Semetic).", "OP can't kasher the microwave (or anything else). Given that, by strictest practice, anything cooked 100% by a non-Jew is trayif\\* (not kosher) and renders the cookware trayif also, \"cleaning\" the microwave isn't going to wash. That's also why she was het up about the plates: ceramics can't be kashered at all.\n\nAnd this wasn't an egg mayo sandwich (which, yeah, unsupervised food but it's difficult to make \"actively\" trayif and doesn't contain meat or dairy). It was trayif meat - I would consider that to have unkoshered anything it touched, and I'm not that fussed about these things. (I keep my practices to myself and neither eat meat in company nor serve it to others).\n\nAdd that to the general tone of the post - \"fundamentalist religion\", scrupulously avoiding saying \"Jewish\" etc - and I think OP is antisemitic and did it the second they had an excuse.\n\n\\*doesn't apply to things like carrot sticks - supposed-to-be-raw food is fine.", "\"Now I do think that a good way to solve this would be OP koshering the microwave\" .. quite an investment, possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely: a new microwave, new pots, new dishes - and since you likely can not replace one plate, a whole new set, ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is an AH .. she is unlikely to want to make good on that.", "Not at all. They knew the non-kosher microwave was broken and didn't bother telling OP. They should apologize to OP for being idiots.

Why? Because if I was stupid enough not to warn someone about something they needed to know, then the fallout from that idiocy would be my fault and mine alone.

They knew, absolutely knew, that the microwave was broken. \n\nAnd to be clear, they didn't do what they wanted. What they wanted was to cook their child's food the way they expected to cook it.

I fortunately knew very few who were so disrespectful of others while demanding respect for themselves.", "I'm not assuming.

No one has used the dishwasher in over 18 months. It's entirely possible that it could be broken, and I would have no idea, since I don't use it, nor do I \"test it out\" every month to make sure it's working, as there is no reason to test it out. The dishwasher could be broken right now and I wouldn't know, but if guests came over and asked to use it, we might discover it broken. Would I be a \"major asshole\" for not \"telling them\" that it was broken?\n\nHowever - that's a bit of a spurious comparison on my part, as OP's brother SHOULD know that his sister (OP) has a child with dietary issues, and since he knows the microwave could be a necessary tool for OP during her visits to his home, he SHOULD have been responsible to test and repair said microwave before his sister and her child visited, as he KNOWS of the child's dietary issues.", "Why are you interpreting Tisha's actions in the least charitable way possible and interpreting OP in the best way?

It\u2019s common for autistic people at least to not be able to change the brand of food. Like for me a company that I really enjoyed changed I think it was just two ingredients in their food and I can\u2019t eat it anymore.", "I\u2019m guessing it probably was the poster who clearly is OP or a family member as they are commenting on every single comment and calling people Tish if they don\u2019t agree with them. I think no matter what she could have at least asked before just walking in using the microwave. For all we know if she asked a solution could have been found to satisfy both parties\u2026", "What is ESH. I\u2019m new here", "Nobody was saying that. They were saying that this specific child with dietary limitations might only eat frozen food. No one was even saying it for sure it was just an assumption based on the info given. \n\nI am also autistic and like 90% of my meals are frozen so tbh it\u2019s a fair guess", "We do not yes. But if they have food that the autistic person won't eat they won't eat it.  We also have a specific food that will keep us much calmer and in a good mood. We also do not like crowds noise and people. (All which seems to be at that party)  if I have to go to a party with alot of people (yes family too can cause it) I will likely be extra stressed out bringing a food you know 100% will be a perfect fit for your child  to keep him in a good mood is the best bet if it's Dino nuggies it's Dino nuggies.  \n\nThere is specific food I can not touch.  Fuck mushroom fuck squid fuck kiwi. If it has any type of texture that's abnormal, I can't touch it and would starve. I'm a adult though and can keep myself a bit hungry in a event and wait and eat later. \n\nThis is a esh issue minus the kid and the dad. Idk what they expected the child to starve because that's what would happen the child would have starved. And having everyone eating except a child is kinda rude.", "In his family? Is that really asking too much? Should they exclude him because of his disability?", "So you would want the kid to go hungry for the entire time that they\u2019re there. You should not have kids if you\u2019re OK with that.", "If we strip out the religious aspect of it, what OP did was clearly bad manners.  If you are at someone else\u2019s house and discover that the toilet is clogged in the bathroom they tell you to use, do you go searching through their bedrooms to see if there are any connected bathrooms?  No, decent people with the vaguest sense of manners don\u2019t do that.  They let their host know there is a problem with the accommodations and ask if there is another bathroom to use. \n\nThat is what OP should have done here when she realized the microwave wasn\u2019t working, ask her hosts what she should do in the alternative.  But OP\u2019s breach of etiquette is even worse here, because she knew about her SIL\u2019s religious beliefs and the implications for it, and decided to use it anyway without permission.  And then tried to justify it by degrade her SIL\u2019s religion.  \n\nThat is the behavior your are supporting here, the deliberate degradation and violation of someone else\u2019s deeply held beliefs in their own home.", "And is speaking with such venom about people they\u2019re not supposed to know. This story has certainly resonated with them! \ud83d\ude02\n\nEven if they\u2019re not OP, they\u2019re making themself come across as a massive AH.", "**they DID NOT deny the kid food. STOP hiding your antisemitism behind lies.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey gave OP a separate kitchen, assuming that would work. And instead of asking them how to solve it when that did not work, she KNOWINGLY and wilfully destroyed their kitchen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"OP is definitely the AH for sneaking into the kitchen and not using her words\" .. causing thousands of dollars of damage to the hosts.", "It's still disrespectful and she could have easily double wrapped the nuggets had OP asked. But she didn't. She decided to go about it on her own because Tishas needs are \"undiagnosed OCD\" and separating milk and meat is \"crazy\".", "They might just have ordered some food. Or they could even have ALL gone to a restaurant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCertainly MUCH cheaper than ruining a kosher kitchen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut OP did not even WANT to find a solution.", "No, they would not have used their kosher kitchen to heat up the food OP brought.  What the heck?", "My son has ASD. When people try to pull the whole \"Just keep serving him the same thing, he'll eat when he gets hungry enough\" bullshit I explain it like this.  \n\n\n\"How many days would I have to serve you a plate of your own shit before you'd be hungry enough to eat it?\"  \n\n\nThey cannot understand that for a lot of people with ASD their brain simply does not process those things as edible. It's not \"food\".", "The new solution? The old microwave is the new downstairs one and they buy a new one for the upstairs! \n\n\nJk", "Right. If OP had told aunt about the broken microwave, a solution could've been found. Maybe one of the two upstairs microwave can be brought down and aunt could still be in control of contamination.", "Is there a dish or food you will eat that is not frozen?", "Read her post again, there is no diagnosis yet, and I\u2019m sorry until that is factual info, there is no disability.", "I\u2019m saying using starve is stupid. The kid will be hungry yes but not starving. Op should have simply gone home or brought  another food her kid would eat.", "They sure are. I\u2019ve genuinely laughed reading their rants. Not all of them, there\u2019s to many \ud83d\ude02", "Where's the venom? I would love to see you point some of it out. I won't imply that you're a massive asshole as I find that sort of behavior to be indicative of massive assholes, but you do you.", "Thousands of dollars of damage? Evidence please. And please stop projecting. Any anti semitism you perceive in that post is entirely on your own eye.", "She didn't ruin their kitchen. Kashering a microwave takes no effort. And she didn't do it because she doesn't like their religious needs. She did it because she had to take care of her child's medical dietary restrictions that they chose to disregard.", "100% this. I have ASD and growing up it was a huge issue during mealtimes. I wasn't diagnosed until I was an adult and my mum struggled so much to feed me as a kid. It obviously wasn't her fault, she didn't know, but making me eat something I felt was \"wrong\" caused me to scream, cry, have panic attacks or just throw it back up.\n\nEven 30 years later I'm struggling. There's a lot of stuff I don't think I've ever even tried and yet the thought of giving it a go makes my skin crawl and I know it'd be a disaster if I did end up trying.", "People just dont get that the discomfort and sensory load can be so overwhelming that it is indistinguishable from pain or extreem  revulsion. To the point that the pain and discomfort of starving is preferable. You can't wait out hunger in a person that will call your bluff on it.", "Exactly! And while it might be good to try to expand your child\u2019s pallet. It\u2019s not always possible. Fed is best. Even if all the they\u2019ll eat is Dino nuggets. EDIT! I have straight up with used to eat for a week. Because we did not have the money to buy food and a company change the ingredients in my favorite foods. I could no longer eat it because of that and it tasted wrong, and it felt wrong to the point where I would throw up. Yes this is something I\u2019m working on, but I\u2019m not all that worried because I still eat.", "My son also has ASD.  I have celiac disease.  I never thought others should be the ones making accommodations.  I planned ahead and made sure we had plenty of food.   If OP feels entitled to a microwave, they can bring their own.  Entitled to use whatever dishes they want?  They should bring their own.  This post absolutely drips with contempt.  OP, YTA.  A very entitled AH.", "Plenty but if I didn\u2019t know a microwave wasn\u2019t available I would also bring a frozen food. Also the time it takes to pack and then bring food over to someone else\u2019s home would ruin most of the non frozen foods I do eat. I struggle with eating leftovers or second portions because of how the texture of food changes as it sits. \n\nI get that you\u2019re trying to make a point but you\u2019re kind of being a dick about it. Neither you or I know this kid or his specific dietary restrictions nor can we assume to.", "That is just a ridiculous take. So unless someone is diagnosed they don't have a disability. What backward thinking is that! That's like saying Mount etna didn't exist until it was made known to the whole world!", "Being diagnosed put a name to my disability, it doesn't mean I wasn't disabled before."]}
