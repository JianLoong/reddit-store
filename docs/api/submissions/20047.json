And it makes me doubt the accuracy of your description of her reaction.  I have a feeling this wasn't the first time you ignored her house rules due to a lack of respect and possibly bigotry (antisemitism,  I'm guessing since their kosher rules require separated equipment for cooking different things).  If you can't handle her house rules,  don't visit her house.  YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou know the rules of the home. Period. It sounds like Tisha keeps Kosher, which means yes, things need to be kept separate. You can disagree with the household rules by not attending events.

If she keeps kosher, which is what it sounds like based on your description, she may no longer consider the microwave kosher, and depending on how devout she is may replace the microwave you used.", "I\u2019m guessing Tisha is Jewish and she is keeping kosher. Hardcore Jews have double kitchens. Sinks, silverware, in this case a dishwasher, plates, you name it. Part of their religion says certain foods don\u2019t mix, that includes mixing utensils/anything that touches certain other foods. The biggest example is dairy and meat. Something along the lines of \u201cnot cooking a baby animal in its mother's milk.\u201d My best friend, who is an ambivalent Jew and lives in the US, will order a cheeseburger but make sure the meat and cheese just don\u2019t touch (so like lettuce in between) Her dad tells her this is cheating and reminds her she shouldn\u2019t do that and we laugh about it, but for heavily practicing Jewish people this is no joke. When I have stayed in Israel with her orthodox Jewish relatives, I\u2019ve seen one side of a kitchen be a mirror image of the other. Double everything. While this may sound ridiculous or excessive to you, it\u2019s kind of like serving something containing animal products to a vegetarian in their own house and not thinking it\u2019s a big deal. Making a genuine mistake, NTA. But not apologizing profusely afterwards or getting defensive, YTA.", "You are being incredibly disrespectful and dismissive of her religion. Please apologize and get educated about her religion and dietary rules. You should have used your words and asked for guidance if the microwave you were directed to use wasn\u2019t working.

Your SIL is keeping kosher, which is why she has different utensils and such in her kitchen.  Maybe it's \"just religion\" to you, but to Tisha it's a way of life that you completely dismiss, disregard, and disrespect, in *her* home.  You don't have to believe in religion at all, that's your right, but it does not give you the right to belittle and disrespect someone else's religion.  Do your brother and SIL a favour and stay out of their home if you can't be bothered to respect it.", "Yta. You know you are. Kosher kitchen are a huge deal. You went to a home, knowing they wouldn\u2019t have something your kid could eat, brought a meal you knew would be an issue, and decided to disregard her entire religion and beliefs set, because you didn\u2019t want to ask for help with the microwave **they specifically keep because they understand not everyone eats kosher** It\u2019s not like you had no idea about this.

You knew it was not acceptable to use the main microwave, and you knew this would violate Tisha\u2019s religion- it was unbelievably disrespectful to do that. \n\nThat being said, they should have made sure the second microwave was functioning, knowing they were hosting people who would need it. \n\nBut seriously- how hard it to say \u201chey, the microwave isn\u2019t working, can you help me figure out a way to heat this up?\u201d", "YTA. You knowingly did something that would instigate a fight with Tisha in her own home.

The reason for accommodation is not relevant. Both require accommodation.

Again, many schools of thought here hold that it is not possible to kasher a microwave that has been used for non-kosher food items, as the vapors of those items would have seeped into elements of the microwave that can't be suitably kashered, like the vents, the glass, and the plastic sealing. To kasher what might now be a non-kosher microwave (depending on Tisha's own views), they wouldn't even be able to do it themselves--they would need to get an experienced rabbi to do it for them.\n\nRegardless, kashering is a pain in the ass process, especially when it comes to something like a microwave... much less a microwave that was used on a non-kosher meat product. It's not just a quick easy fix if you hold strict kosher, which is one of many likely reasons why Tisha was so upset (if OP's description can even be believed, since they very clearly do not like or respect her or her religious practices at all, to the point that they come across as blatantly anti-Semetic).", "OP can't kasher the microwave (or anything else). Given that, by strictest practice, anything cooked 100% by a non-Jew is trayif\\* (not kosher) and renders the cookware trayif also, \"cleaning\" the microwave isn't going to wash. That's also why she was het up about the plates: ceramics can't be kashered at all.\n\nAnd this wasn't an egg mayo sandwich (which, yeah, unsupervised food but it's difficult to make \"actively\" trayif and doesn't contain meat or dairy). It was trayif meat - I would consider that to have unkoshered anything it touched, and I'm not that fussed about these things. (I keep my practices to myself and neither eat meat in company nor serve it to others).\n\nAdd that to the general tone of the post - \"fundamentalist religion\", scrupulously avoiding saying \"Jewish\" etc - and I think OP is antisemitic and did it the second they had an excuse.\n\n\\*doesn't apply to things like carrot sticks - supposed-to-be-raw food is fine.", "\"Now I do think that a good way to solve this would be OP koshering the microwave\" .. quite an investment, possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLikely: a new microwave, new pots, new dishes - and since you likely can not replace one plate, a whole new set, ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is an AH .. she is unlikely to want to make good on that.", "Not at all. They knew the non-kosher microwave was broken and didn't bother telling OP. They should apologize to OP for being idiots.

Why? Because if I was stupid enough not to warn someone about something they needed to know, then the fallout from that idiocy would be my fault and mine alone.

They knew, absolutely knew, that the microwave was broken. \n\nAnd to be clear, they didn't do what they wanted. What they wanted was to cook their child's food the way they expected to cook it.

I fortunately knew very few who were so disrespectful of others while demanding respect for themselves.", "I'm not assuming.

No one has used the dishwasher in over 18 months. It's entirely possible that it could be broken, and I would have no idea, since I don't use it, nor do I \"test it out\" every month to make sure it's working, as there is no reason to test it out. The dishwasher could be broken right now and I wouldn't know, but if guests came over and asked to use it, we might discover it broken. Would I be a \"major asshole\" for not \"telling them\" that it was broken?\n\nHowever - that's a bit of a spurious comparison on my part, as OP's brother SHOULD know that his sister (OP) has a child with dietary issues, and since he knows the microwave could be a necessary tool for OP during her visits to his home, he SHOULD have been responsible to test and repair said microwave before his sister and her child visited, as he KNOWS of the child's dietary issues.", "Why are you interpreting Tisha's actions in the least charitable way possible and interpreting OP in the best way?

Third, some people won't eat meat or dairy at a restaurant but will eat vegetarian/vegan options, although that is technically also a kashrut problem, but a somewhat less serious one. And finally, in order to be kosher a restaurant must be certified by a local Kashrut agency that provides supervision and guidance ensure compliance with halachic standards. There is usually am organization that provides people looking for kosher places with a list of the certified options in the area. There are generally not many options, though.

That\u2019s not for you to decide. Tisha needed to know which plates had touched the non-kosher chicken because they can\u2019t use those plates anymore. And just so you know, they do make kosher fun shaped chicken nuggets that I\u2019m sure your SIL would have been happy to provide if she had known your son wanted them.", "Sounds like she\u2019s kosher in which case, YTA!\n\nKashrut has very specific rules. According to Judaism I\u2019m pretty sure she would have to get a new microwave. This may sound ridiculous to someone outside the religion but it is important to people who follow these laws.", "YTA", "Yta, it is her house too. Her house her rules. You could have presented them with the situation and asked what to do. There would likely have been a way that didn\u2019t cause drama. But you chose not to ask what the best solution was.", "YTA. Keeping kosher has nothing to do with her mental health and if your brother is mocking that by saying she's ocd, maybe he needs to do some research about the person he is marrying and why it's so important to keep kosher. I was leaning towards a soft YTA because you clearly don't understand but the way you've doubled down is gross and shows that you are choosing ignorance instead of taking like, ten minutes, to do some research and educate yourself. Of course you should apologize. It's not your house. You need to respect the boundaries in someone else's home. Doesn't matter if you've been there for years, it's literally not your home.", "YTA", "You\u2019re upset that\u2026 you have to eat the food your soon to be SIL cooks when she hosts family events? Or *gasp* eat outside? Your brother even maintains a separate microwave for you to use knowing your son has different dietary needs and you still feel like you\u2019re in the right? This is an established boundary that is clearly very important to Trisha. But because it didn\u2019t matter to you it felt fine for you to violate it?\n\n\n\nMajor YTA. I hope Trisha declines to invite you to future family events she puts the work into hosting until you apologize.", "Yes, YTA. Very much so. It\u2019s not as if this was a rule they made up since your last visit and didn\u2019t tell you about. On the contrary, you were very well aware of it and knew exactly what you were doing when you put that food in the microwave.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like their rules, but as long as your under their roof you need to respect them, and you absolutely should apologize to your brother and sister in law for breaking their firmly established kitchen rules, and to your father for ruining his celebration.", "I will preface this by explaining that I say all this as someone who is both autistic and understanding of sensory issues (especially in relation to food) and also as a Jewish person who understands well the laws and care that go into maintaining a kosher household. YTA. Tisha is Jewish and you just made her house unkosher for some fucking chicken nuggets. You\u2019re unbelievably selfish, and from the way you talk, it sounds like you\u2019re antisemitic to boot, either that or ignorant and entitled, or some unholy combination of all of the above. \u201cFundamentalist religion\u201d my ass, you just said that because you knew the people of this subreddit would tear you to shreds once they realized that Tisha is Jewish and you just made her house unkosher. Well, you can hide behind vague words all you want, but you\u2019re still the asshole here. It is a labor of time and love and yes, money, to keep a kosher house. And you didn\u2019t just unkosher a plate or a fork or something easily replaceable, you ruined the whole fucking microwave too, and those are expensive. When you realized the microwave you were supposed to use was broken, you should have gone to your brother and Tisha, whose home you are a guest in, and asked how to proceed. You have no respect for Tisha, or for your brother either. You make it sound like he had this house before he met Tisha, so he owns it, and he has still made the decision to kosher the house to make it a livable home for her needs as well. When you used the wrong microwave, you didn\u2019t just disrespect Tisha and her religious beliefs. You also disrespected your brother and the way he wants to keep his home, because this is a decision he approved, and from your own words, spent significant amounts of money on. There were a million other solutions that could have accommodated both your son\u2019s needs and your brother and FSIL\u2019s rules for their house, and in your selfishness you ignored all of them and did exactly as you pleased without any regard to who it would hurt. You owe them both a huge apology. Although judging by your comments, they\u2019ll never receive one from you. If you get uninvited to the wedding, it\u2019d be kinder than you deserve. If someone did this to me I would never speak to them again. It is the height of disrespect. Shame on you, OP.", "YTA. Buy them a new microwave - suggest they put the one you used in the basement to replace the broken one. Try to be more respectful of the people you visit.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m very certain Tisha grew up ultra orthodox Jewish and thus keeps strictly kosher. You wouldn\u2019t bring pork into a Muslim person\u2019s house and use their appliances to cook, would you? So why can\u2019t you respect kosher practice?", "YTA What if she had an extreme food allergy instead of tightly held religious beliefs? Would you still disregard it and cook food she was deathly allergic to in her home? Probably not. Not respecting her beliefs because you don't agree with them makes you a bigot.", "YTA, I don't follow the religious practices, but I damn well won't disrespect them like you have. She had even compromised and caters for things counter to her beliefs in her own home. You just disrespected that as well.", "YTA and tbh you sound prejudice. Your brother shouldn't allow you over anymore", "YTA. (Really you're worse than an AH but that's the highest judgement this sub allows, unfortunately.) You're an antisemitic biggot, for obvious reasons. So is your husband for referring to Judaism as \"undiagnosed OCD\".", "YTA. Big time.  Let's start with your heading, which is disingenuous. It should read: \"AITA for knowingly disregarding the house rules of my brother and SIL, who my husband and I think are being ridiculous, in a way I knew would upset them, and causing them untold amount of financial damage, even though they had provided some accommodation for my son's needs.\" Your post drips with anti-Semitism, and your hatred of your SIL comes through loud and clear. You're basically erasing her by focusing on the fact that this was your brother's home first, that your brother is the one who \"spent a fortune \" redoing the kitchen that you violated, and calling the microwave your son's uncle's.  They've tried to accommodate you by providing a microwave and dishes just for you and your son and by offering to shop with you and even pay for it. So you cannot claim ignorance. If the microwave has a problem, you should have asked your brother or Trish what alternative could be worked out, because that is the respectful thing to do in someone else's home. Even if you did use to cook Thanksgiving dinner in that kitchen in the old days, so what? It is still not your kitchen. It seems nothing they do will be \"reasonable\" for you because it sounds like you just do not want to be accommodated and instead want to piss over their kitchen to mark your territory as the female who cooked in there first, which is kind of sick.  As a mom to several children with various disabilities, I'll also add YTA for not providing suitable food for your special-needs child that doesn't depend on someone else's appliance that may or may not work, in a situation that you already know has challenges. You have the responsibility of feeding your special-needs child and are not entitled to expect anyone else to cater to his needs or to disrespect their religion or their home in order to feed him. (I am very grateful when someone does consider my children's needs, as it is kind of them, but I would never expect or feel entitled to that.) Using your child's disability as a way of excusing your attack on your SIL is pretty despicable. If you find yourself no longer invited to any family gatherings at your brother's home, that's your doing. With this much disdain coming across in just a short post, I can't even imagine the level of negativity you project to them in person - it must be very unpleasant to have around. Your mother is right: you need to apologize big time and mean it if you hope to have any relationship with them going forward. I'm not holding out much hope of that happening though, given all your additional comments.", "YTA", "YTA. This is obviously a Kosher household. You have made absolutely zero attempts to understand, and your reaction is completely bigoted. You could have brought a cold lunch for your son.", "So youre just an antisemite... Got it", "YTA because it is not your house. Guests should ask permission. You were impolite. You could have asked. If you asked she may have given you permission but you disregarded the house rules.", "YTA and clearly you have a problem with the fact that your SIL is kosher. I cannot imagine being butthurt by my brother being willing to embrace the dietary requirements of his partner.   \n\n\nYou making an effort not to mention the kosher part also makes me believe you knew you were TA.", "YTA. they have rules in the house for food and that should be respected. To me it sounds like shes kosher which means meat is to be kept completely separate from dairy seperate dishes many people use separate sinks some people even use seperate stoves and other cooking appliances which should be respected in their home. You just went in and put meat on whatever dishes, and used stuff that you weren't supposed to. Did you ask what you could do? did you ask if there was another thing you could have used. Now for her to keep kosher there is a long disinfecting process that she may choose to do or some people prefer to throw stuff out which would cost extra money. So yta respect other peoples house rules.", "YTA for this type of behavior as a guest in their home. \n\nIf you had a guest in your home, you wouldn't give a damn what they thought of your rules; as long as they were followed. You might even say \"respect my rules or don't come\". Same applies to you as a guest in others home.", "YTA here 100% and YES you need to make some SINCERE apologies ASAP for your despicable lack of good manners.  Your son's eating disorder is a YOU problem--and it certainly was a weird coincidence that your brother's downstairs microwave just happened to break the very day that you wanted to heat up some dino nuggets. \n\nYour opinions, and ignorant dismissiveness, about Tisha's religious practices are another YOU problem.  Get over it.  You KNEW it was an issue and did it anyway-- that totally makes you the AH here. \n\nRhetorical question here:  How would you have felt if Tisha had made a scene about your son's eating disorder being \"legalistic and beyond the point of rules\" and force fed him some pizza?

The Orthodox largely keep to themselves---send their children to special private schools, etc. \n\nI knew a couple of Conservative families that did keep kosher kitchens, and all of the kids from those families went on to marry fellow Conservative Jews. I would imagine that issues like this are part of the reason why---keeping a truly kosher kitchen is a lot of work, effort, and money, and it's not compatible with lifestyles that most non-Jews are accustomed to.

You violated sacred dietary laws despite knowing the rules. To me personally, eating pork isn't a big deal, but I wouldn't bring it to a Jewish or Muslim person's home. That would be extremely disrespectful. The same with using their microwave. It was a disgusting act of anti-Semitism. You simply did not care about their religious beliefs and customs because they didn't matter to you. You took every opportunity to put down and recontextualize their religious beliefs to make them seem silly and/or a personal attack on you. In your eyes all you did was try to feed your son, and that's obviously not true.   \n\n\nWhat you did was hateful and wrong and bigoted. You behaved like a complete asshole.

I assume reading between the lines that probably means she grew up orthodox or Hasidic but is now some sort of Reform.

Plus people who leave conservative religions often do things the way they were raised even if they no longer identify with that type or branch of religion. I\u2019ve met a lot of ex Mormons who still don\u2019t drink alcohol or coffee or ex Hindus who don\u2019t eat beef just because it\u2019s how they grew up.

It cant be that difficult. You are not the victim here.\n\nFyI Kosher generally means that the animals were raised and slaughtered a certain way, to maintain a respect for God by not mistreating or eating mistreated animals.

Apparently, there is some trick to slamming the door, which OP had trouble with. \n\nBrother should have figured she'd need help with the defective appliance anyway and gone with her. \n\nOP was, however, an AH to grab random plates and forks in the kitchen and use the microwave.", "NTA If cleaning a microwave is too much trouble for SIL she should stop inviting people over for dinner.", "I\u2019d like to point out that chicken nuggets are something to AVOID if you suffer from GERD\u2026", "YTA.

Hell, I've known vegans who won't allow animal products in their house, and while this seems extreme to some, at the end of the day, their house, their rules.\n\nYou really should have asked and explained the dilemma. I'm not sure what GERD is like, but if your son has a highly restrictive diet, why wasn't the food prepared beforehand, just in case? I have a slightly restrictive diet (vegetarian), and I've learned the hard way to at least pack a snack. There were definitely better ways to go about this.\n\nYou also sound judgy of her dietary restrictions, which isn't cool. The \"issues\" they have caused your family sound like they're just minor inconveniences (I agree that the waste sucks, although if it really does bother you, you could just bring real dishes and clean them later). If they're THAT much of a hardship, maybe you should host next time.", "YTA - you knew the rules yet you clearly think they're ridiculous from the way you spoke and you made a conscious choice to disrespect Tisha in her own home.

You should buy them a new microwave on top of the apology.", "YTA, you knew her rules in her house and you disrespected them.", "YTA, for several reasons.  First, because you didn't bother to communicate with either your SIL or your brother that the microwave wasn't working and you needed another way to heat up your nuggets.  That would have been SO easy, and would have avoided the entire problem.  Second, you didn't care about disrupting the way their kitchen was set up because you clearly don't like Tish and think being kosher is ridiculous, though you say if they were Muslim you wouldn't bring in pork.  So you'll make allowances for Muslim dietary laws but not Jewish dietary laws?  Anti-Semitic much?  Third, you keep saying that you used to use that kitchen to cook before your brother married Tish.  Well, he DID marry her, and you're going to have to accommodate the changes your brother made that have changed how the kitchen works in his house.  You just don't want to do that because you don't like her.  Fourth, you have clearly not tried to learn anything about being kosher.  It's really not that hard.  Aside from no pork, she has dishes and utensils to be used with meat, and dishes and utensils to be used with dairy.  Meat and dairy are never eaten at the same time or in the same meal.  The stove is probably used for both though not at the same time, so by asking and doing what they said, you could have skipped the entire issue.  Your entire attitude is entitled, rude, and dismissive of an entire religion and of your brother and his wishes.  You might want to think seriously about getting over yourself.  You are not the main character at your brother's house.", "YTA. Keeping kosher isn\u2019t an OCD restriction. Also how entitled to  just heat something without asking.

Go be antisemitic somewhere far away from your brother and his wife.", "YTA. You just needed to avoid a few things. I understand sensory issues. I have them (diagnosed nuerodivergent). My kids also have sensory issues.but if I was going to (for example) an Islamic home, I wouldn't take pork. I'd find a passable substitute or have enough respect to find another way.", "YTA and it\u2019s actually a bit astounding you can\u2019t see that. Disregarding the weird, antisemitic undertones (which we shouldn\u2019t, but just to illustrate my point) you, as a guest in another\u2019s house, knowingly disregarded a rule set by the host. If you had a \u201cno shoes\u201d rule and I tracked muddy boot prints all over your carpet, you\u2019d have every right to be upset with me.

You don't get to decide how someone practices their religion. The family still meets at your brother's place, so you need to respect their rules within their house.
