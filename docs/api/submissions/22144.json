Anyways my husband has been sponsoring a new co-worker at his job and I knew of this. But he started acting differently, keeping his phone from me, checking in less often and he decided to go back to the gym. The gym was obviously fine. But he always tells me he does not feel like working out more than 30-45 minutes. On Monday he went and was gone for almost 2 hours and we live 3 minutes from the gym. I asked what took long he said he was dropping a friend off that he meet at the gym. Fine. Next day Tuesday, he goes to the gym again and leaves and says I\u2019ll be home much earlier today. I was like okay bye. After he was gone for 1.5 hours I decided to take a walk to boost my energy. Later on the walk I checked his location which he chooses to leave on ( I have never asked for this and often has told him to turn it off because I think it drains battery). Location was not at the gym, I noticed I am close to the location he is at so I walk there thinking I\u2019ll meet him. Instead he is at the Chinese place with his co worker. He thinks I should not be upset because \u201cI didn\u2019t give him a chance to tell me.\u201d But normally he would invite me to go or tell me before hand.. he said they meet at the gym by accident and she wanted to get food so he took her. I don\u2019t know of think he is cheating I just don\u2019t think it okay. We both only have the same sex friends since we been married. It is not that I am opposed to having opposite sex friends but I think there should be open communication about it. Also the girl was laughing about it and I felt that to be disrespectful as no one was making a joke. I had asked my husband about the gym.

NTA\n\nHe's 100% cheating. No doubt about it. \n\nGet yourself a lawyer ASAP, an STD test, and a therapist for your own mental health. \n\nHe could have easily texted or called at any point to update you on a change of plans, or invite you to meet them. He's being shady about his phone, which means there is something on it he doesn't want you to see. Even if they haven't slept together yet, they are definitely doing something behind your back that would be the equivalent of cheating. Honestly, I would consider lying to me, and sneaking around just straight up cheating. \n\nYou can talk to him, if you want, and maybe he'll confess, but the fact that he lies to you so much kind of makes me wonder if he hasn't cheated on you in the past and gotten away with it. I'd be going through his phone while he's asleep, if you feel like you need evidence (text yourself screenshots), and then get out.", "NTA. \nThe lies that start off small generally mean it will lead to bigger ones, because he got away with the little ones. \nSide note: seems like this is the start of an emotional affair.", "NTA, there is a reason he is lying and acting peculiar.

It was a tiny lie and I didn't care, but I told him that it hurt me he was okay with being dishonest even if it was \"for my benefit\". \n\nLying is never okay, and I told him I worried his little lies would add up to big ones and cheating.\n\nIt's weird that your husband would keep something like this from you, and you should ask him why. \n\nIf it's really nothing serious, then just have a conversation and ask that he be more honest going forward.\n\nBut if it's something bad, like cheating, I hope you know your worth and leave.", "NTA, he might not be hiding anything by having his location available...but he's not communicating well either. Like some others have said there's some red flags but I don't want to be like \"dump this man immediately\" because things don't really work like that!  \n\n\nMaybe set some clearer ground rules, i.e., what would you want to know about in advance, can he text you if he's going to be late etc. If you find yourself living in paranoia though, remember you are never stuck. Best of luck.", "If he has a *habit* of lying about big and little things, why are you upset that you caught him in one?

Not even assuming that cheating is on the table here.  If I'm getting food alone with anotehr woman, and I tell my wife that I'm going to the gym and omitting dinner, she'd understandably be pissed.  A simple call on the way to the dinner place or even a text is quick and a reasonable accommodation to make out of respect for your spouse.\n\nNow to address potential infidelity, don't assume anything for now unless you have reason to suspect something based on prior history.  Let him know why you're upset, but I would omit any mention about cheating.  But I think it's fair to keep this incident in the back of your mind in case you start noticing other suspicious things.  Changes in his daily routine (such as this incident), or \"hanging out with the boys\" more frequently than usual, weird mood shifts more frequently are easy things to spot.  You know him best, just observe and use your common sense intuitions if something starts to seem off.\n\nAgain, and to reiterate, don't make a bigger deal out of this one incident than you need to make it and trust your husband going forward until he gives you a reason not to because you don't want to cause him to desire going to another woman (wouldn't be your fault, but most infidelity happens because because both spouses are fucking up something somwhere) by overreacting and accusing him on a regular basis because one suspicious thing happened.  \n\nGood luck and I hope it's just one isolated incident and everything is fine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
