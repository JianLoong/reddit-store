It sounds like they all have had been with such women and it obviously hasn't turned out well or they wouldn't have been there alone. He will find out that no matter what he wants, his daughter will make her own decisions when the time comes. You have no right to lecture him on how he chooses to raise his daughter unless he's being abusive.

And finally, your boyfriend - guys do talk guy stuff, we all know it. Girls do it too. And this isn't the forum for debating the right/wrong of that. But who does 'guy talk' like that in front of their girlfriend? In her own home? Like, dude...show some respect.
