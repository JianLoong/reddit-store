Don't you think he doesn't feel the same way every day when he misses his wife? No man or woman wants their daughter to be promiscuous. It sounds like they all have had been with such women and it obviously hasn't turned out well or they wouldn't have been there alone. He will find out that no matter what he wants, his daughter will make her own decisions when the time comes. You have no right to lecture him on how he chooses to raise his daughter unless he's being abusive.

Clearly the friend has a really gross attitude towards women, and using that as the basis for how he plans to raise his daughter...ick. He's the worst offender in this. You saying something about it was the right thing to do, but throwing in the barb about his dead wife was not the right way to do it. And finally, your boyfriend - guys do talk guy stuff, we all know it. Girls do it too. And this isn't the forum for debating the right/wrong of that. But who does 'guy talk' like that in front of their girlfriend? In her own home? Like, dude...show some respect.

By the way, I feel I can say this because I, too, am a widower.", "Yeah ESH. I also think he was overcompensating for his actual fear of having to raise her himself.

Either way, that's okay.\n\nWe all have the right to our own opinion. That doesn't mean we're always right. I do not agree with the guy's comments about raising his daughter. But that doesn't mean he can't believe nor say them. He has a right to his opinion ... even if I, the OP, and/or others think he's wrong. I will say the older you get, the more you tend to think the younger generation(s) need more guidance ... even though we all likely did our own fair share of being stupid, acting inappropriately at times, etc etc etc. Such is life.\n\nOP was not wrong to call him out. That's all part of conversation ... even when it's disagreement. But I disagree (as that's my opinion) with her using the deceased wife as ammunition in her retort.

I just think she took it one step too far.", "I think she didn\u2019t go far enough- he should not have custody of any children and I would say that to his face (while thinking much worse).
