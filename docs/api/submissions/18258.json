Sounds like the whole conversation was gross and your boyfriend should have ended their gross conversation. \n\n\nDoes your boyfriend respect women? Like... have you really dove into this? Might be worth exploring.", "I feel sorry for his daughter, too.", "NTA he brought it on himself. Something misogynists tend to do.", "NTA talk shit get hit (metaphorically, not encouraging actual violence lol)", "ESH. The way he was talking about his underage daughter is extremely disgusting and inappropriate. But I do think your comment was out of line. You should have instead pointed out how gross his comments were, rather than taking a jab at his dead wife.", "Good lord ESH.  I mean you all really, really suck - him for his planned misogynistic rules and discussing his prepubescent daughter in a sexualized way, you for weaponizing *the death of his wife* to insult his parenting.  He\u2019s disgusting and you\u2019re heartless.  You were both beyond out of line, all of the lines, there is scarcely a line to be found that wasn\u2019t crossed by one or the other of you.  I strongly suggest you never share a room with this person again, I see nothing good coming of it.  And FFS learn how to control what comes out of your mouth, no matter how offended you are.", "NTA. He\u2019s a misogynist and doesn\u2019t deserve sympathy or respect.", "ESH. I\u2019ll agree, his \u2018life views\u2019 are quite misogynistic, considering his opening comment was \u201che was very friendly with lots of women\u201d. Quite hypocritical. But it was unnecessary to bring the deceased wife into the convo. I personally wouldn\u2019t appreciate it if someone use my deceased dad in that context either.", "Nta he deserves nothing", "ESH, \n\nWhat you said was cold, but he sounds like an AH. All his friends and your bf sound like they enable and endorse this view of women.\n\nReminds me of the book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez \"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\"...all the women are whores or saints. There were no other options", "YTA. You were upset at his misogyny but then you made a statement that mothers are the ones who need to teach their daughters that sexism is wrong?? Why is the labor of that responsibility on the woman in the relationship? Focus your message better next time", "ESH - what you said was cruel, what he said was disgusting and misogynistic.", "This is a situation where both people suck, but what you said is so astronomically fucked up that I'm going to have to go with YTA despite what he said being absolutely not OK.  I'm not sure why you think you had any right to tell a widower and a single parent that they're not good enough to raise their own child, but that was WAY out of line.  To say you owe him a public apology would be a massive understatement.", "Yikes! YTA. What a truly heartless thing to say. My god. You owe him the biggest apology.", "YTA. \n\nBeing upset about a conversation other people are having is not grounds to be cruel. \n\nYou didn't even specify what they said other than that it was \"gross\" and you didn't tell us the rules he was (possibly jokingly, possibly seriously) going to implement. You're expecting us to take your word that it was so egregious you had to take the cheapest shot imaginable.", "Yta, WOW\n\n\"I'm sorry your wife is dead because she won't be able to protect your daughter from you\" is beyond cruel. You were being as hurtful as possible because you disagreed with his parenting style. The dude is probably doing all he can to keep it together, parent, work, etc and you just scrapped all over him for it. That's downright vile. You owe him an apology", "YTA the wife comment was unnecessary you could have just focused on calling out his misogyny instead you went lower and brought up his dead wife", "YTA. Who are you to say how he should raise his daughter? Holy crap.", "Yta.  There were so many things you could have said to address this but you went with the lowest, most despicable option.", "YTA. Holy fuck.", "Royal YTA with and a capital B.\nYou shamed yourself and your partner.", "The guys were wrong for their sexist conversation but YTA for bringing up his late wife.", "Wow!!!! I feel bad for you kid growing up with a mom like you. YTA", "If you really think you said nothing wrong then this isn't the relationship for you. He's a widow raising a child without any help. You, my dear and the no help portion of this.", "YTA playing the dead wife card to get back and hurt this guy about his stupid misogynistic gross comments was over kill. He was 100% wrong but your response in my opinion was out of line and makes the issue you, instead of him and his shitty view point. Also that\u2019s a man your BF calls a friend? You probably need to clean your own house before you come after that guy again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
