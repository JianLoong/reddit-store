This is insane behavior on their part.  If they want to meet their son's bio-child (NOT their granddaughter, as to be a parent or grandparent you have to be involved in a child's life) the appropriate thing to do would be to contact her mother and work it out that way.

Their son's genetic contribution does not change the fact that they kidnapped an 8-year-old they had never met.", "They kidnapped your daughter. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t they come to your door or write you a letter? Had they not just kidnapped your daughter, maybe you\u2019d have considered letting them be a part of her life.

Taking a kid without notice is not a grandparental thing to do.", "NTA. Did your daughter know these people were her grandparents btw?", "You didn't refuse to let them *meet* your daughter. You refused to accept them KIDNAPPING your daughter. WTAF? There is no realm of sanity where their actions were ok.\n\nNTA. AT ALL.", "NTA if Mike gave up full custody then his parents have nothing.

Especially if he\u2019s making six figures. Please for the sake of your daughter, go to court and file for child support and the courts will make him pay a set amount. You may have this mindset that you can do it on your own and don\u2019t need his money but that money isn\u2019t for you - it\u2019s for your kiddo.
