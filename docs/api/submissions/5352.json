It really felt like he didn't care.", "Info: did you order her present before or after she gave you a Christmas present?\n\nEdit:\n\nDoubt we get an answer so here are my thoughts, do with it what you want.\n\nI have never seen a person caring about wrapping if the gift was any good. By good I don't mean expensive, but like well thought out and fitting. So my assumption is that if the gift was good, the surprise a success - she wouldn't have cared less about the wrapping.\n\nHowever, if the gift smells like \"desperate last minute purchase\" or \"I couldn't think of anything good so here have this random thing\" or sth, at least you expect the person to wrap it properly. Like to show that there was at least a gesture of appreciation.\n\nI get that you were busy and all that. It was convenient to not wrap it. Got it. But so far I'm under the impression that not only didn't your wrap it, but the gift itself also kinda sucked. While she, on the other hand, put a lot of effort into the wrapping at least, don't know if the gift was any good.\n\nMaybe you don't know yet, because y'all are planning to open the presents on christmas day or morning or whatever. In that case, wrapping the stuff is kinda important because the unwrapping is part of the whole thing and the surprise is kinda ruined if it isn't wrapped.\n\nI go with a soft YTA, NTA if the gift was any good and she wasn't waiting to unwrap it later this week.\n\nEdit: at least it wasn't a last minute purchase. I am tending more to NTA.", "A bag could\u2019ve been enough", "YTA.\n\nSorry, my guy. Gotta complete step 2 of gift giving. She gave up her time, energy, and a bit of money to nicely wrap your gifts. It's fun to rip stuff open. \n\nSome people are in relationships where they don't care about this stuff and the gift is enough. You're not in that relationship. Gotta make the effort. You're not working 20 hours a day in a steel mill. You have the 5 mins to wrap it or pickup a gift bag at the big box store.", "YTA\n\nYou know that gift bags exist, right?", "Soft YTA. Now I have no idea what you bought her or where from,but even Amazon offer a gift wrapping service. You could have paid a little bit more and had it delivered wrapped. Sometimes I pick my own present and that I don't expect to be wrapped as I know what it is,but buying me a surprise and not going to the effort of wrapping it would fall a bit flat. Also you said you haven't got time/ energy to do unnecessary shopping. It all feels like you felt getting a present for your girlfriend was a bit unnecessary. Order on line and can't be arsed to wrap it. Yeah I'd be gutted too", "YTA. For many people the wrapping is a sign that you care enough to put effort in.

Majority of people are super tired from work/looking after kids etc, esp in winter. But it literally takes less than 5 minutes to wrap a gift. You didn't need any elaborate wrapping, you could've even ordered wrapping paper online or just quickly nipped into a shop after work to pick some up. It just shows a lack of thought and effort, I'd be bummed out too if my partner did that to me.", "I'm going with NAH, based on your comments.

That's not a Christmas gift.", "NAH. I feel like I can see both sides. For you, you put effort into your gift and that\u2019s the part that counts. For her, she sat for a while making your gifts look nice and is sad you didn\u2019t care about the way hers looked. \n\nI think the important part here isn\u2019t who is right, but what each of you cares about. She clearly cares about this, so you know now that little bit of extra effort is important to her. Now you know, and this is a (fairly) new relationship so you\u2019re still learning what\u2019s gonna make each other feel loved and respected. \n\nJust apologise for hurting her feelings, make it clear that it wasn\u2019t your intent to make it look like you don\u2019t care and make sure to just keep some nice generic paper for all occasions in the house for next time. As long as you\u2019re not making her feel like you don\u2019t put effort in elsewhere in your relationship then a bit of communication and care should go a long way I think since it\u2019s just a little miscommunication", "NTA. But not completely off the hook. People make time for things they want to do or need to do. The fact you didn't wrap it shows her you are trying to slide by with the bare minimum. You may not feel that way but that's how it looks. That doesn't make you an AH but it does show a lack of effort in some form. So in other words, it doesn't make you an AH. Just makes you a little thoughtless.\n\nGood luck", "YTA\n\nYou're too tired to perform a SIMPLE task that will take all of 5 minutes?", "I could understand her side a little bit but you apologized in advance.\nI hope she isn't that picky otherwise .\n\nNTA.", "YTA. It's about the entire gesture of the gift. It's a token of thoughtfulness.\n\nIt would have been better to come 10 minutes late because you bought a gift bag.", "NTA.\n\nYour excuse is pretty pathetic. And I don\u2019t buy it. \n\nBut no, you aren\u2019t an asshole for not wrapping her gift.", "YTA\n You saw that she put a lot of effort into wrapping your presents and took a lot of care into making it a whole Christmas experience. Maybe you haven't already learned but that shows you she values the whole experience of wrapped presents showing effort. Same as when a partner goes all out for your birthday, and you just show up to theirs with a cake you picked up on the way. Yes you got her a gift and did the bare minimum for exchanging presents, yet you just did the bare minimum. This can be really hurtful but you became an asshole when you dismissed her feelings by saying you've been busy. Almost everyone thinks they are busy. Instead you would have been better off apologizing for making it seem like you put in little effort when you were actually excited about giving her a gift. \n\nIt would probably help the two of you to sit down and talk about expectations/wants in terms of holidays. Should presents be wrapped, are you going to decorate, do you celebrate separately or switch between families, do you actually care about Easter or st Patrick's day?", "NTA for not wrapping the gift\u2026 but this is not about wrapping. She said you don\u2019t put as much effort in as her. This sounds like the straw that broke the camels back. You\u2019re exhausted,  she\u2019s fed up. If you are genuinely invested in this relationship then maybe you could sit down together, talk honestly and really listen to each other.", "NTA I get that she was disappointed but you had a legitimate reason, and then she took it to a whole other level.  If this is standard behaviour for her, be prepared for a life of extra effort to stop her catastrophising over the little things (edit: which I might have just done too).", "NTA, but a bit lazy. A variety of stores, including pharmacies and grocery stores have gift wrapping materials. You haven't been to one of those stores in the last few months ?\n\nNow that you know that it is so important to her, be sure to grab some gift bags in the after Christmas sales. You'll be all set for next year.", "She seems to be a shallow person.", "Lmao at people who apparently would be ungrateful to get an unwrapped gift.

No one needs to waste time wrapping gifts and making the moment special for anyone. \n\nObviously sarcasm. It would have teken you two minutes or you could have just bought a gift bag. \n\nYTA", "NAH.  You probably should have wrapped the gift.  However, your girlfriend sounds a bit entitled.  Neither is really wrong.  You both could do better, though.", "What\u2019s the big deal? If he\u2019s kind, compassionate, someone she can talk to, he makes her laugh. He meets her physical needs. So he didn\u2019t wrap the gift. that cancels out everything else? NTA.", "NTA\n\nSure, opening wrapped gifts is fun, but at the end of the day... YOU GOT HER A GIFT. Her being more focused on the fact that it wasn't wrapped than on the fact that you were kind enough to get her a gift says a lot about her personality, and I'd look out for other warning signs of shallow behavior in this relationship.\n\nI don't understand all the YTA's here... Christmas isn't about gifts or wrapping or anything... And no one is OBLIGATED to give gifts, you do it because you want to, and the gesture is way more important than the aesthetics of wrapping a gift.\n\nAlso, everyone is different when it comes to that. My future MIL is a really crafty person, and loves doing cute wrapping and packaging for gifts. It's always a lot of fun to open them, and something she genuinely ENJOYS doing. My mother is not a crafty person at all, and is very busy, but always takes the time to find meaningful gifts. However, they aren't always wrapped (one year, she even made a joke out of her lack of wrapping skills and craftiness and wrapped everyone's gifts in newspaper). It didn't take away from the meaningfulness of the gifts at ALL, and everyone had a good laugh about it. Wrapping things and making them ''cute'' just isn't really her strong suit. They are both wonderful people who give great gifts, and at the end of the day, in the long run, people remember the gift, not the packaging.\n\nIt's about the GESTURE, not the aesthetic. It's very shallow of this girl to be focused on that. This sounds like the kind of person who you could buy a car for as a Sweet 16 gift, and then they'd harp that it was the wrong color. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nIf someone is kind enough to get me a gift, I'm sure as hell not going to complain that it wasn't wrapped.", "Bro are you serious right now??", "omgosh. gift wrapping is like free. is she really weaponizing this?\n\nNTA\n\nleave her. major red flag. do you want this for the rest of your life?\n\nimagine if a dude had a whinge about this lmao. the sexism on Reddit would shut him down immediately", "It\u2019s not about the gift wrapping. I\u2019ll bet that this isn\u2019t the first time you disappointed her with some kind of lack of effort.", "YTA\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: you didn\u2019t give her her gift at the same time she gave you yours, and when you did give it to her, it was still in the box that it was shipped in. No matter when you bought it or ordered it or whatever,  that screams that it was bought last minute without a lot of thought. Even if that\u2019s not actually the case, that\u2019s the impression it gives: that it was last minute, and rushed. \n\n When you have some free time in early next month, go to Walgreens or target or wherever and pick up a handful of clearanced out holiday gift bags.  And probably some regular ones too, for good measure. Keep them in the closet and in the future, you won\u2019t have to worry about going out to get something to wrap a gift with.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't care enough to get a $1 gift bag from Target.", "How you wrap a gift is a show of thoughtfulness.

I just didn\u2019t interpret it that way, I just thought it was something she personally liked to go all out for.", "Counterpoint.

I was happy to pick her out something special. I just didn\u2019t understand that the presentation was important. Our birthdays are close together, and for that we both just put something in a bag for each other. No elaborate wrapping on her part. It wasn\u2019t until this Christmas that I saw she went all out, and I figured that was just for fun.

I feel like there was just some kind of mismatch between what we both saw as being important parts of the gift-giving process. I\u2019ll definitely make sure to apologize again tomorrow so she understands that it wasn\u2019t intentional on my part, maybe just a bit thoughtless.", "I agree with this. NAH because you had a mismatch of expectations. Not wrapping a gift doesn\u2019t make you an AH. I always meticulously wrapped gifts, my husband never did.

I don't even care about \"green\" living and I still use furoshiki for pretty much all family gifts.  It's quite easy -- quicker and easier than wrapping paper in my opinion -- and you can wash, reuse, and exchange cloths with each other repeatedly, or just reuse them in everyday life, e.g. as a grocery bag, wrapping clothing for packing or storage, holding files and folders for paperwork, etc.", "Someone didn't grow up in a house that has a box full of boxes that get used for every season. Probably never heard about carefully undoing and folding the wrapping/tissue paper for next time.", "No one loved you ever with any effort, did they? Cause it takes literally no time to buy a Christmas paper bag and put the gift in it even if you don't have time. And the universe knows wrap papers exists to be teared apart and thrown away. Same words can be used to say we don't need candles anymore on bdays. Your logic made the turtles cry in water.", "Oh please what a load of BS. You can use newspaper (personally I like to use the comics), you can throw it in a re-usable bag, for our kids we used paper grocery bags that they could color on and make their own designs. There are so many environmentally-friendly options that don\u2019t include buying gift wrap. \n\nNow if you want to debate the environmental impact of Christmas in general, well that\u2019s a conversation.\n\nPs my wife has a huge bag full of gift wrap that has been used again and again for years. Instead of ripping it off and throwing it in the garbage, she takes off the tape and folds it nicely for reuse. Just saying.", "So cut up a paper grocery bag and draw snowmen on it with a sharpie. Possibly could have even ordered it to come gift wrapped, if he'd thought about it. The point is, OP didn't bother to try to come up with anything.", "She went all out because she wanted it to be special for you. It's just one more little way she shows how much she cares.", "In this case, it doesn't matter who's right or who's wrong. What happened is, she is expecting more of a gesture. The present matters less to her than the gesture. It is important to love people in the way that they want to be loved, within your own boundaries. And that means in the future, you give her presents that look nice even if they just go in a nice gift bag with a little tissue paper. The way out of this with Good Boyfriend Points is to go get her a card or something and wrap it up pretty, give it to her and tell her you'll know for next time.", "Those aren\u2019t the two options though. You\u2019re making this a bigger deal than it is.\n\nIt was very thoughtful of you to get the gift! The issues is, I think she wonders if it felt more like an obligation to you since you just brought it and seemed kind of whatever about it.\n\nI don\u2019t think you were the A H, but neither is she for expecting a little more effort. It wouldn\u2019t have you that long to put it in a gift bag. Heck, you could\u2019ve ordered a Christmas bag and tissue paper when you ordered the gift!", "The thing about relationships is sometimes (most of the time) it's the small things. The small bits of effort that really show appreciation for your partner in a huge way. Wrapping your gift to make it look nice and festive is one of those things. That little extra effort.", "You can make it up to her. Being respectful of her feelings is something she'll recognize if you make an effort to make her feel better.\n\nYou could get her another small gift and way over wrap it. Like get 5 boxes of that all fit inside each other and wrap each one and inside each box is a smaller wrapped box. Gotta make sure the actual gift is meaningful. Then tell her how sorry you are for being a dofus.  A fancy Christmas ornament could be nice.", "Think this is key. I think NTA, but explain and do better in the future.  Every family is different. \nAnd yes, remove pricetags, place in a gift bag with tissue paper.  Some folks now really don't even  know how to use gifts wrap.", "He has also unwrapped his gift from me before, taken the paper and said \"give me a minute\" then come back with my gifts in my (now ripped) paper.\n\nOne year he used glue to wrap my b'day gifts which meant when I opened them in bed the glue did something to the ink on the paper and the ink went everywhere (looked like a bloodbath on fresh white bedding).\n\nI actually can't wait to see what he does this year haha", "Yes. When I couldn't wrap a gift I at least put it in a pretty little bag or something.", "Yes.", "YTA. Takes 5 minutes more to wrap it. Why was it so hard to put the extra 5 minutes?", "TBH you make time for what you think is important", "Yeah dude. Judging from her reaction, this isn\u2019t the first time you pulled this. She said it was \u201cproof\u201d meaning she had suspicions before that it might be the case. Now you\u2019re here not accepting the overwhelming judgement, insisting to anyone who listens that you\u2019re right and her reaction was wrong instead of talking to your girlfriend and rectifying your mistake.", "My partner gave me one wrapped gift and one unwrapped because it came right before we did gift exchanges. I didn't throw a fit that one wasn't wrapped. What ever happened to its the thought that counts? Is it \"It's the thought but only how I want it to be thought of\" that counts?", "So, your girlfriend is not worth the trip to the store?", "So, not only do you try BS excuses, you're also poor at planning. \n\nYou knew that the present was coming and  you (assumedly) knew that she wanted it wrapped/bagged. How did you think this was going to happen? \n\nWhile already out, from going to or coming from work or other outings, you should have stopped at the store, any store this time of year, and picked up the supplies to be ready for when the package arrived.", "They sell cheap gift bags in liquor stores, gas stations, grocery stores, etc. \n\nJust stop. Takevyour judgement.", "It might be worth investing in some wrapping supplies and keeping them stocked so you don\u2019t have to run out and buy them every time you have a single present to wrap. I keep several rolls of wrapping paper along with tape, scissors and ribbons and bows in an under the bed storage box so that anytime a present needs to be wrapped, it can be done right then and there. But you can also keep tape and scissors in the trunk of your car or your glove box and then if you need to wrap on the run, you just run into the grocery store, book store or drug store and grab a roll of paper and a bow and then wrap on the fly. That way at least you don\u2019t have double back home to do the wrapping.", "Let me clarify what I meant since I think you're getting confused by the variety of reasons people have given you. You saw the effort that she put into the wrapping and that should have been an indication that gift wrapping is important to her. Yet you didn't and figured it had no importance to her since it wasn't communicated just implied. You're not an AH for that. It's your last paragraph in the post where it pushes you to be an AH in my opinion. Your gf voiced that she was disappointed and felt like you not wrapping your present showed a lack of care. Regardless if that's how you meant it that's how she felt and you should have apologized for not wrapping the present making it seem like you didn't care. You should have asked her what her expectations are for holidays so that there isn't confusion in the future where it seems like someone doesn't care.\n\nSometimes it helps the relationships in your life if you apologize for things you didn't intend. You didn't intend to hurt her feelings but looking at many of the other replies there are quite a few people who would be hurt if their present wasn't wrapped.", "Overall I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not that important. It has no real purpose. People are making Way too big to deal with this.", "Someone has never been to a stationery store and seen the rolls upon rolls of wrapping paper for every imaginable holiday. Someone thinks that wrapping paper manufacturers no longer exist and that stores don\u2019t sell it.", "Where do you live that newspaper is readily available?  \n Second, it\u2019s still bad for the environment.  you\u2019re taking an entire newspaper when you\u2019re not going to read it. And it still gonna get thrown away 30 seconds after being open.\n\nNot sure why you had the emotional outburst, but your facts are wrong.", "So what if he didn\u2019t try to come up with anything? He still got her a gift. It\u2019s paper that will be discarded within seconds.  \n\nOP probably didn\u2019t feel like stopping by grocery store to get a bag.", "I agree, I just need to show her in another way that I do care about how this upset her and will do better in the future. A card is a good idea, thank you!", ">I didn't throw a fit that one wasn't wrapped. What ever happened to its the thought that counts? Is it \"It's the thought but only how I want it to be thought of\" that counts?\n\nFor xmas my gf gave me a new JBL speaker (mine broke few weeks ago). She didnt wrap it. I came home, she had the amazon package open (to check if all was okay) and box was on the table and said \"merry xmas babe\". She gave me a gift i needed, wrapping is just a needless \"uhh i wonder what it is\" that just gets me annoyed to unwrap, and clean the mess haha", "I did apologize to her, and I definitely haven\u2019t said anything to invalidate her feelings at this point. Even after she told me she felt like what I did was low effort, I didn\u2019t tell her she was wrong, I just explained how I saw it from my end. She\u2019s completely entitled to be upset with me, and I will wrap all future presents from now on. I just wasn\u2019t sure if other people would agree with whether or not I was an AH for not doing it in the first place. You\u2019re right, there are a lot of people here who feel similar to my GF. Thanks for your perspective.", "No... but the environment is no excuse for being lazy because of boxes...", "1. your facts are wrong. why would you assume I am buying a newspaper just for gift wrap? Of course I read it. I buy one every Sunday. \n\n2. places to find newspapers: take them out of the cardboard/paper recycling container. Ask a neighbor. I went on my local Facebook group after our daughter was born and asked if anyone had a paper I could have from her birthdate (got about 30 responses in 10 minutes). Anywhere that has free papers-where I\u2019m from (Los Angeles) the LA Weekly is out for free at like every corner and food joint. Every coffee shop ever has papers lying around that are going to be thrown out. Like you can literally find them in the trash and repurpose them. \n\nWhere do you live that it\u2019s a struggle to get a hold of a newspaper? Antarctica?\n\n3. My \u201cemotional outburst\u201d (laying out facts I thought?) stems from people using environmentalism as an excuse for thoughtless behavior.", "It\u2019s fairly normal to encounter an already finished newspaper you can reuse. Like at work, or someone has a subscription, or even your own subscription? Also I run into them on the subway or at coffee shops.", "Every now and then my local newspaper delivers to my house as a promotion to try and get me to subscribe.  I keep a stash of them in my closet to dry out wet shoes and put down on the table or floor when I need to contain a mess.", "He could put it in a gift bag. I keep gift bags and reuse them over and over. I love the drawstring bags that Amazon wraps gifts in. I will use them for several nights of Hanukkah in a row sometimes. This year the Christmas Eve Jammie\u2019s got wrapped in those Amazon bags, (Yes we celebrate both holidays)  and they sitting under the Christmas tree. One of the only negatives to having moved closer to our family in 2020, is that no one sends us pre-wrapped Amazon Christmas presents anymore. So those could be the last of those bags I will ever get.", "Honestly the best thing is to make sure the next time you get her a gift to spend a little extra time and put a little extra thought into wrapping it. When my husband was younger he hated apologizing, but I always knew he had listened to me and felt sorry by the effort he put in to changing his behavior. Like words are cheap, it\u2019s actions that matter. A verbal apology on top of the behavior change is like whipped cream on ice cream, the ice cream is fine by itself, the whipped cream not so much, and together they\u2019re even better. Or if you feel it warrants an apology now before your next gift giving opportunity, instead of just buying an apology card try making one by hand. That sort of effort would really show you care.", "I live in the San Fernando Valley; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it . There are no LA weeklies anywhere. The only thing I see is occasionally the Valley  news when I go to Nat\u2019s. I don\u2019t even think that  the weekly has that many stands anymore. I never see them when I\u2019m in the city. The OP said he was working a lot and tired. Think he has time to go scrounging through recycle containers?\n\nWith that being said, newspaper still not really considered very tasteful way of wrapping a gift. And with Covid and all that. Homeless everywhere. A lot of the newspapers probably not even sanitary.", "What if the OP doesn\u2019t live in a big city or someplace where newspaper is readily available? Besides, that\u2019s actually pretty tacky. I have a feeling his girlfriend wouldn\u2019t appreciate the newspaper much better than having it unwrapped. \n\nBut you should let people know maybe on Twitter that they should stop buying wrapping paper, since newspaper is everywhere. You can put the whole gift wrapping industry out of business!", "Okay I\u2019m getting the vibe that you must have pissed off a loved one in the same way as OP if you\u2019re reaching so hard as to use homelessness as a justification to not do something as basic as wrapping a single gift.", "I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re being deliberately obtuse but literally the newspaper is available everywhere. Your original comment said that wrapping gifts is wasteful. The other commenter pointed out that there are less wasteful options. Now not wrapping it is tacky? Way to move goalposts. Have a nice day", "I really don\u2019t care what type of vibe you\u2019re getting. Your opinion of me is completely irrelevant to the discussion. But if you think it\u2019s a reach to think that a guy who\u2019s working long hours doesn\u2019t want to wander around the homeless and dig inside of dumpsters for newspaper to wrap a gift, then your opinion of me makes that much more sense.", "I never said not wrapping it is tacky.  I also pointed out that newspaper is hard to get without having to search for it.  OP is already exhausted from long hours at work and I don\u2019t think he wants to spend another hour looking for used newspaper.\n\nSomeone like you thinking that I\u2019m obtuse doesn\u2019t bother me.", "Right like I don\u2019t work hard and come home tired. I have a full time physical job, my own side business, a baby and a toddler. I\u2019m functioning on like zero sleep. Yet SOMEHOW I can find time and energy to shop for and wrap multiple gifts for everyone. Without the use of Amazon or rummaging through a homeless camp even! \n\nBut I do that, you know, because I care about the people in my life and want to put in effort to show them. if you think the effort isn\u2019t worth it for your loved ones, you do you. They might not expect it and I\u2019m sure you find other ways to show them you care. Not everyone cares about wrapped gifts or gifts at all. (no snark or sarcasm intended).\n\nOP\u2019s gf did care though. She will just have to adjust her expectations and learn to be thankful for low effort. (Sarcasm intended)", "I have no idea if you work hard or not and I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going by what the OP said. He said he was \u201cswamped\u201c with work and has very little energy outside of that. \n\nIt\u2019s silly to imply that the OP doesn\u2019t care about his girlfriend simply because he did not wrap her gift."]}
