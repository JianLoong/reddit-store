Its not hard to at least have a gift bag.\nMy partner pulled my present out one year, and handed it to me still in the stores bag. It really felt like he didn't care.", "Info: did you order her present before or after she gave you a Christmas present?\n\nEdit:\n\nDoubt we get an answer so here are my thoughts, do with it what you want.\n\nI have never seen a person caring about wrapping if the gift was any good. By good I don't mean expensive, but like well thought out and fitting. So my assumption is that if the gift was good, the surprise a success - she wouldn't have cared less about the wrapping.\n\nHowever, if the gift smells like \"desperate last minute purchase\" or \"I couldn't think of anything good so here have this random thing\" or sth, at least you expect the person to wrap it properly. Like to show that there was at least a gesture of appreciation.\n\nI get that you were busy and all that. It was convenient to not wrap it. Got it. But so far I'm under the impression that not only didn't your wrap it, but the gift itself also kinda sucked. While she, on the other hand, put a lot of effort into the wrapping at least, don't know if the gift was any good.\n\nMaybe you don't know yet, because y'all are planning to open the presents on christmas day or morning or whatever. In that case, wrapping the stuff is kinda important because the unwrapping is part of the whole thing and the surprise is kinda ruined if it isn't wrapped.\n\nI go with a soft YTA, NTA if the gift was any good and she wasn't waiting to unwrap it later this week.\n\nEdit: at least it wasn't a last minute purchase. I am tending more to NTA.", "A bag could\u2019ve been enough", "YTA.\n\nSorry, my guy. Gotta complete step 2 of gift giving. She gave up her time, energy, and a bit of money to nicely wrap your gifts. It's fun to rip stuff open. \n\nSome people are in relationships where they don't care about this stuff and the gift is enough. You're not in that relationship. Gotta make the effort. You're not working 20 hours a day in a steel mill. You have the 5 mins to wrap it or pickup a gift bag at the big box store.", "YTA\n\nYou know that gift bags exist, right?", "Soft YTA. Now I have no idea what you bought her or where from,but even Amazon offer a gift wrapping service. You could have paid a little bit more and had it delivered wrapped. Sometimes I pick my own present and that I don't expect to be wrapped as I know what it is,but buying me a surprise and not going to the effort of wrapping it would fall a bit flat. Also you said you haven't got time/ energy to do unnecessary shopping. It all feels like you felt getting a present for your girlfriend was a bit unnecessary. Order on line and can't be arsed to wrap it. Yeah I'd be gutted too", "YTA. For many people the wrapping is a sign that you care enough to put effort in.

Majority of people are super tired from work/looking after kids etc, esp in winter. But it literally takes less than 5 minutes to wrap a gift. You didn't need any elaborate wrapping, you could've even ordered wrapping paper online or just quickly nipped into a shop after work to pick some up. It just shows a lack of thought and effort, I'd be bummed out too if my partner did that to me.", "I'm going with NAH, based on your comments.

That's not a Christmas gift.", "NAH. I feel like I can see both sides. For you, you put effort into your gift and that\u2019s the part that counts. For her, she sat for a while making your gifts look nice and is sad you didn\u2019t care about the way hers looked. \n\nI think the important part here isn\u2019t who is right, but what each of you cares about. She clearly cares about this, so you know now that little bit of extra effort is important to her. Now you know, and this is a (fairly) new relationship so you\u2019re still learning what\u2019s gonna make each other feel loved and respected. \n\nJust apologise for hurting her feelings, make it clear that it wasn\u2019t your intent to make it look like you don\u2019t care and make sure to just keep some nice generic paper for all occasions in the house for next time. As long as you\u2019re not making her feel like you don\u2019t put effort in elsewhere in your relationship then a bit of communication and care should go a long way I think since it\u2019s just a little miscommunication", "NTA. But not completely off the hook. People make time for things they want to do or need to do. The fact you didn't wrap it shows her you are trying to slide by with the bare minimum. You may not feel that way but that's how it looks. That doesn't make you an AH but it does show a lack of effort in some form. So in other words, it doesn't make you an AH. Just makes you a little thoughtless.\n\nGood luck", "YTA\n\nYou're too tired to perform a SIMPLE task that will take all of 5 minutes?", "I could understand her side a little bit but you apologized in advance.\nI hope she isn't that picky otherwise .\n\nNTA.", "YTA. It's about the entire gesture of the gift. It's a token of thoughtfulness.\n\nIt would have been better to come 10 minutes late because you bought a gift bag.", "NTA.\n\nYour excuse is pretty pathetic. And I don\u2019t buy it. \n\nBut no, you aren\u2019t an asshole for not wrapping her gift.", "YTA\n You saw that she put a lot of effort into wrapping your presents and took a lot of care into making it a whole Christmas experience. Maybe you haven't already learned but that shows you she values the whole experience of wrapped presents showing effort. Same as when a partner goes all out for your birthday, and you just show up to theirs with a cake you picked up on the way. Yes you got her a gift and did the bare minimum for exchanging presents, yet you just did the bare minimum. This can be really hurtful but you became an asshole when you dismissed her feelings by saying you've been busy. Almost everyone thinks they are busy. Instead you would have been better off apologizing for making it seem like you put in little effort when you were actually excited about giving her a gift. \n\nIt would probably help the two of you to sit down and talk about expectations/wants in terms of holidays. Should presents be wrapped, are you going to decorate, do you celebrate separately or switch between families, do you actually care about Easter or st Patrick's day?", "NTA for not wrapping the gift\u2026 but this is not about wrapping. She said you don\u2019t put as much effort in as her. This sounds like the straw that broke the camels back. You\u2019re exhausted,  she\u2019s fed up. If you are genuinely invested in this relationship then maybe you could sit down together, talk honestly and really listen to each other.", "NTA I get that she was disappointed but you had a legitimate reason, and then she took it to a whole other level.  If this is standard behaviour for her, be prepared for a life of extra effort to stop her catastrophising over the little things (edit: which I might have just done too).", "NTA, but a bit lazy. A variety of stores, including pharmacies and grocery stores have gift wrapping materials. You haven't been to one of those stores in the last few months ?\n\nNow that you know that it is so important to her, be sure to grab some gift bags in the after Christmas sales. You'll be all set for next year.", "She seems to be a shallow person.", "Lmao at people who apparently would be ungrateful to get an unwrapped gift.

No one needs to waste time wrapping gifts and making the moment special for anyone. \n\nObviously sarcasm. It would have teken you two minutes or you could have just bought a gift bag. \n\nYTA", "NAH.  You probably should have wrapped the gift.  However, your girlfriend sounds a bit entitled.  Neither is really wrong.  You both could do better, though.", "What\u2019s the big deal? If he\u2019s kind, compassionate, someone she can talk to, he makes her laugh. He meets her physical needs. So he didn\u2019t wrap the gift. that cancels out everything else? NTA.", "NTA\n\nSure, opening wrapped gifts is fun, but at the end of the day... YOU GOT HER A GIFT. Her being more focused on the fact that it wasn't wrapped than on the fact that you were kind enough to get her a gift says a lot about her personality, and I'd look out for other warning signs of shallow behavior in this relationship.\n\nI don't understand all the YTA's here... Christmas isn't about gifts or wrapping or anything... And no one is OBLIGATED to give gifts, you do it because you want to, and the gesture is way more important than the aesthetics of wrapping a gift.\n\nAlso, everyone is different when it comes to that. My future MIL is a really crafty person, and loves doing cute wrapping and packaging for gifts. It's always a lot of fun to open them, and something she genuinely ENJOYS doing. My mother is not a crafty person at all, and is very busy, but always takes the time to find meaningful gifts. However, they aren't always wrapped (one year, she even made a joke out of her lack of wrapping skills and craftiness and wrapped everyone's gifts in newspaper). It didn't take away from the meaningfulness of the gifts at ALL, and everyone had a good laugh about it. Wrapping things and making them ''cute'' just isn't really her strong suit. They are both wonderful people who give great gifts, and at the end of the day, in the long run, people remember the gift, not the packaging.\n\nIt's about the GESTURE, not the aesthetic. It's very shallow of this girl to be focused on that. This sounds like the kind of person who you could buy a car for as a Sweet 16 gift, and then they'd harp that it was the wrong color. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nIf someone is kind enough to get me a gift, I'm sure as hell not going to complain that it wasn't wrapped.", "Bro are you serious right now??", "omgosh. gift wrapping is like free. is she really weaponizing this?\n\nNTA\n\nleave her. major red flag. do you want this for the rest of your life?\n\nimagine if a dude had a whinge about this lmao. the sexism on Reddit would shut him down immediately", "It\u2019s not about the gift wrapping. I\u2019ll bet that this isn\u2019t the first time you disappointed her with some kind of lack of effort.", "YTA\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: you didn\u2019t give her her gift at the same time she gave you yours, and when you did give it to her, it was still in the box that it was shipped in. No matter when you bought it or ordered it or whatever,  that screams that it was bought last minute without a lot of thought. Even if that\u2019s not actually the case, that\u2019s the impression it gives: that it was last minute, and rushed. \n\n When you have some free time in early next month, go to Walgreens or target or wherever and pick up a handful of clearanced out holiday gift bags.  And probably some regular ones too, for good measure. Keep them in the closet and in the future, you won\u2019t have to worry about going out to get something to wrap a gift with.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't care enough to get a $1 gift bag from Target.", "How you wrap a gift is a show of thoughtfulness.

Our birthdays are close together, and for that we both just put something in a bag for each other. No elaborate wrapping on her part. It wasn\u2019t until this Christmas that I saw she went all out, and I figured that was just for fun.

I\u2019ll definitely make sure to apologize again tomorrow so she understands that it wasn\u2019t intentional on my part, maybe just a bit thoughtless.", "I agree with this. NAH because you had a mismatch of expectations. Not wrapping a gift doesn\u2019t make you an AH. I always meticulously wrapped gifts, my husband never did.

I don't even care about \"green\" living and I still use furoshiki for pretty much all family gifts.  It's quite easy -- quicker and easier than wrapping paper in my opinion -- and you can wash, reuse, and exchange cloths with each other repeatedly, or just reuse them in everyday life, e.g. as a grocery bag, wrapping clothing for packing or storage, holding files and folders for paperwork, etc.", "Someone didn't grow up in a house that has a box full of boxes that get used for every season. Probably never heard about carefully undoing and folding the wrapping/tissue paper for next time.", "No one loved you ever with any effort, did they? Cause it takes literally no time to buy a Christmas paper bag and put the gift in it even if you don't have time. And the universe knows wrap papers exists to be teared apart and thrown away. Same words can be used to say we don't need candles anymore on bdays. Your logic made the turtles cry in water.", "Oh please what a load of BS. You can use newspaper (personally I like to use the comics), you can throw it in a re-usable bag, for our kids we used paper grocery bags that they could color on and make their own designs. There are so many environmentally-friendly options that don\u2019t include buying gift wrap. \n\nNow if you want to debate the environmental impact of Christmas in general, well that\u2019s a conversation.\n\nPs my wife has a huge bag full of gift wrap that has been used again and again for years. Instead of ripping it off and throwing it in the garbage, she takes off the tape and folds it nicely for reuse. Just saying.", "So cut up a paper grocery bag and draw snowmen on it with a sharpie. Possibly could have even ordered it to come gift wrapped, if he'd thought about it. The point is, OP didn't bother to try to come up with anything.", "She went all out because she wanted it to be special for you. It's just one more little way she shows how much she cares.", "In this case, it doesn't matter who's right or who's wrong. What happened is, she is expecting more of a gesture. The present matters less to her than the gesture. It is important to love people in the way that they want to be loved, within your own boundaries. And that means in the future, you give her presents that look nice even if they just go in a nice gift bag with a little tissue paper. The way out of this with Good Boyfriend Points is to go get her a card or something and wrap it up pretty, give it to her and tell her you'll know for next time.", "Those aren\u2019t the two options though. You\u2019re making this a bigger deal than it is.\n\nIt was very thoughtful of you to get the gift!
