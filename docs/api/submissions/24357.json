My mom ended up telling a bunch of other family members including my sister (32F) and aunt (68F).\n\nMy sister sent my daughter a text about it being good timing or something because my daughter doesn't go back to school until next week so she'll be able to \"get the hang of it\" by then. My daughter showed it to me and started screaming saying that her period was private and I shouldn't have told anyone. She is mortified and upset. \n\nI talked to my wife (36F) about it because I don't see the big deal -- we don't keep secrets in this family and I don't think periods are anything to be embarrassed about but my wife took my daughter's side and said that in the future I should ask Anna before I share any details of her life with anyone, especially my mom who likes to share family information.\n\nI really thought it wasn't an issue, but now I'm wondering, AITA?", "created_utc": 1691708571, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nrf6w/aita_for_telling_family_about_my_daughters_period/", "score": 1162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think de stigmatizing periods is important, but don\u2019t discuss another persons body without their consent. You embarrassed her and you owe her an apology.", "Yes YTA.\n\nIt's possible to consider periods normal and still not gossip to all and sundry about someone else's period.  The choice is not a binary \"tell no one out of shame\" / \"announce to the world\".  There's a middle ground that involves respect.\n\nYour daughter deserves an apology and your mom deserves an information diet.", "You seem to not understand that something can be PRIVATE without being SECRET. \n\nYeah, YTA. \n\nPeriods are natural, normal, and not shameful. But info about someone else\u2019s period isn\u2019t something you should share without asking them.", "YTA big time.\n\nThis is  highly personal info.  Esp at that age.\n\nShe's entitled to some privacy, sheesh.  Also, you just got on her \"don't tell dad anything\" list.  If you don't want to be on that list, then go apologize and reassure her that you will ask from now on.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s 12 and it\u2019s a private matter, not a gossip topic for your entire family.", "Of course YTA.\n\n>I don't see the big deal -- we don't keep secrets in this family \n\nIt's a big deal because it was none of your business, it's none of their business, and it's not an appropriate topic for \"family discussion\". And it has nothing to do with secrets. It's not a secret, it's PRIVATE. Did you seriously make it all the way to the age of 38 without understanding the difference between \"keeping secrets\" and \"respecting someone's privacy\"?\n\n>and I don't think periods are anything to be embarrassed about \n\nThey're not. But just because something isn't \"something to be embarrassed about\" doesn't mean that it's an appropriate topic of group conversation. Again: private. People are entitled to keep their intimate bodily goings-on private. It's has nothing to do with being \"embarrassed\". It's just not your business to decide to discuss someone else's bodily functions with other people without their consent.\n\nLet me put it this way: if you got jock itch (aka, a common minor fungal infection) on your penis, that's nothing to be embarrassed about either. It happens sometimes, even just from being really sweaty at the gym. No big deal. Easily cleared up with some anti-fungal cream.\n\nif your daughter happened to find out that you had a minor fungal infection on your penis, would you want her to tell three random family members of her choosing about your minor penis issue? Why not? It's nothing embarrassing. Happens to men all the time. Are you starting to see my point?\n\nThis isn't about secrets, or shame. It's about things that are NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. Including your daughter's body; your daughter's bodily functions; and discussing either of those things with ANYONE without her consent. Learn to respect people's privacy. Until you do, YTA.", "YTA. This is not keeping a secret. This is about respecting your daughter and her privacy. Right now she is getting used to a new bodily function that seems weird and gross and she is sure everyone knows she is having her period. She will eventually get accustomed to it and her feelings will change but now it is all too new. \n\nThis was not your news to share. Again YTA.", "YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA.  It's like you looked in a book that was called \"How Not to Parent\".  Jesus fucking Christ.", "YTA. Good rule of thumb, if it\u2019s not happening to your body, then you\u2019re not the one who gets to decide who you can tell about it. \n\nYou owe your daughter a huge apology.", "YTA. Dude, do you inform the whole extended family when you have diarrhea? Are you going to tell your mom if you get ED and start taking Viagra?", "YTA\n\nIt's personal, private information and not yours to share.  Full stop.  If you believe Anna should have autonomy over her body, then you should know better.  Her body, her choice.", "YTA Buddy! At that age it\u2019s so private, confusing and embarrassing. She didn\u2019t even have time to wrap her head around it and now it\u2019s family fodder.", "Yes YTA....my mother did this to me, and I am still getting over it.  I am 48 years old.  I still remember the humiliation.  \n\nShe is a young woman coming to grips with something with hormones swirling.", "YTA. When I was a teenager my mom would tell her parents every single thing I said or did. It made me realize I couldn\u2019t talk to her because she cared more about gossiping about me than keeping my confidence. I stopped taking to her. I stopped telling her about myself, my life, my problems. Our relationship never recovered. We were never close when I became an adult and moved out. This issue fundamentally broke our relationship. Don\u2019t be like that.", "YTA.\n\nHave you ever had a period?  No?  Well, there you go.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is right: check with Anna before you share any of her information. It's not hard, literally just talk to your daughter", "YTA, just because you don't see anything wrong with it doesn't mean your daugther doesn't. For a young woman this is a crazy time, she's just got her first period and it can be over whelming enough without getting unsolicited texts.", "YTA\n\nThis was definitely NOT your news to share. If your daughter wants to talk about it, that's up to her, not you. And why would you tell somebody that you know has a big mouth? Periods are nothing to be ashamed of but when you're a 12 year old going though major changes, people focusing on it and talking to you about it and making it a big deal about it is EXTREMELY embarrassing.", "YTA, and here's why I think it\n\nMenstruation ISN'T a secret, and I hate that women/girls are made to feel embarassed by it. However, it's not up to you to go broadcasting to the entire universe (yes, it was only family but to a 12 yr old just starting it seems like it is) that she's on this great journey. It's happening to HER, so its up to HER to tell whomever she wants to. It's not your period. When you do get one, feel free to tell everyone (yes I know he's a he, note the sarcasm)", "Yep, YTA.  That wasn't your info to share with the world.  You know very very little about teenagers, women in general, and periods if you thought she would be ok with you doing that.", "YTA, There's nothing worse than an oversharing family member.", "YTA\n\nHow would you like it if someone announced to the world that you were bleeding from your privates?", "Wow...I'm an really old Dad and even I know you're a total AH.  YOU don't keep secrets...and who made you the guardian of all special secrets that your daughter has?  How about she starts broadcasting on social media your ED prescription, when you get Peyronie's, any other number of 'special' issues that come up in life.  Sorry sir...you won jerk Dad of the week with this one.", "YTA. You should learn to respect your daughter's boundaries.", "YTA. It\u2019s none of your mothers business. You owe your daughter a massive apology", "YTA OP. Let me put in another perspective where you might be able to understand. Let's have your daughter air out any dirty laundry you have in the past, doesn't matter if it may affect your marriage, your daughter can air it out because \"you dont keep secrets in the famly\" If you don't see the errors of your ways then prepare for your daughter to keep you on a need to know basis and she will reel in your wife for this too. Don't be pissed off at your wife when she doesn't tell you any information about your daughter in the future.", "YTA.  This wasn't your news to share, that's for sure.  Plus you told a known blabbermouth?   \n Oh hell no.\n\nStart making it up to her now or you're not going to hear her say two words together until she moves out.", "YTA- I would have screamed at my dad too if he would have shared with the whole world that I had started my period. That is extremely personal and you humiliated her. You have NO right to share information about anything going on with her body. That is HER information to share when and if she chooses. Are you going to broadcast the first time she has a gynecological exam to the whole world? I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be thrilled when you share the results of her first pap smear with the whole family. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you need to apologize to your daughter for humiliating her and then you need to learn to keep HER business to yourself!", "YTA - you\u2019re an idiot.", "Oh boy.  You have to ask?  YTA.\n\nTeenage girls DO have privacy rights.", "YTA.  You don't get to decide whether someone else's health information should be shared.  Yeah, periods are natural and not shameful.  Same with erectile dysfunction....if that ever happens to you, do you want someone else to share that information with your blabbermouth mother?", "YTA. This was not your business to share. This was your daughter's experience.", "Yup, don't talk about your family's personal shit like its casual gossip even to other fam.", "YTA and, apparently, an idiot. You told your mother, who you know to be a gossip, private information that was not yours to tell. Apologize to your daughter, and do better, but don't expect her to share much with you for some time.", "This reminds me of the time my mom told a bunch of people at her church about my colonoscopy. I loved being asked questions about it by people who only know me through my mom.\n\nThat was sarcasm.\n\nDon\u2019t do this again. YTA.", "YTA. And i don\u2019t believe for a second that everyone in your family has zero secrets.", "You\u2019re a gossip just like your mother. Have some sensitivity, and respect her feelings.

What business is it of anyone else?", "YTA \n\nAnd how would you have felt if you were 12yo and your mom told everyone you\u2019d started having wet dreams?\n\nIt may be natural, but if it involves your genitalia, it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s damn business", "You're here asking randos on the internet if you were in the wrong instead of actually listening to your wife and daughter. Of course YTA.", "YTA, if you have never had a period, you will never know how it feels . I know it shouldn't be, but when I first started, it was a little embarrassing, and I didn't want anyone to know, especially my whole family, and i was a year younger. \n\nPeriods are normal and should not be taboo,( i do think its great that you want periods to be a comfortable topic) but it doesn't mean you have to share it with your mum, who then told your whole family.  \n\nIf your daughter wanted them to know, she should have been the one to tell them . And not telling family members about her periods is not keeping a secret. it's keeping it private", "Yes. Get a clue. YTA", "YTA. \n\nI am a product of a mother who did the same thing. Expect when she called my dad, he was in an executive meeting and she was on speaker phone. \n\nYou may not feel like it is a big deal and you may not understand, but you are an adult who may be comfortable with their body. I highly doubt any teenager going through any changes would feel comfortable with their bodies. \n\nIm going to leave you with this last thought. How would you have felt if your Dad or Mom told your whole family that they caught you whackin your pud at 12? Would you have felt amazing about it?

My mom did this to me and I still remember how mortified and humiliated felt about it.  She didn't even wait fifteen minutes after I told her until she called her BFF to tell her the news.

Would you be okay with text messages flying back and forth about the length of yourself when you're excited and when you're not, and how long it took you to \"deflate\" and how much stuff came out and where you ended up putting said stuff in her body?

And, you know, you really shouldn't put it THERE because girls don't like that....would that be okay? Because if ANY of that makes you uncomfortable to think about getting those text messages, then you just answered your own question. THAT is how you made your daughter feel. You put your daughters WOMANHOOD on display for the ENTIRE DAMN FAMILY.

My mom ended up telling a bunch of other family members including my sister (32F) and aunt (68F).\n\nMy sister sent my daughter a text about it being good timing or something because my daughter doesn't go back to school until next week so she'll be able to \"get the hang of it\" by then. My daughter showed it to me and started screaming saying that her period was private and I shouldn't have told anyone. She is mortified and upset. \n\nI talked to my wife (36F) about it because I don't see the big deal -- we don't keep secrets in this family and I don't think periods are anything to be embarrassed about but my wife took my daughter's side and said that in the future I should ask Anna before I share any details of her life with anyone, especially my mom who likes to share family information.\n\nI really thought it wasn't an issue, but now I'm wondering, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When you first start it\u2019s a huge change, your body & hormones are changing, your friends are all at different stages of puberty, and it\u2019s just a huge adjustment that can feel very embarrassing and is very personal. It\u2019s her body and what is coming out of it is her business. \n\nWhen I started my period my mom told my aunt who sent me a \u201cwelcome to womanhood\u201d care package, which was a nice gesture but I was mortified that she told people. Also at a sleepover my friends found the card my aunt wrote me and ran around playing \u201ckeep away\u201d with it because they thought it was a love note from a boy and then read it.

You have to remember that she\u2019s only 12 and not mature enough to understand that having her period is just a normal bodily function. To her it\u2019s embarrassing and scary. In the future I would ask your daughter if it\u2019s ok to share something before doing it.", "YTA. Do you discuss the frequency of your sex life with your mother, or the results of your wife's latest pap smear? How about everyone's bowel movements? Does your wife know the story of your first wet dreams as a young man? After all, it's all quite natural and we don't keep secrets in this family. \n\nYou DO NOT share information about another person's body without their consent. This includes family members. It is your daughter's decision to share these things. You owe her an apology.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter's body is not for you to gossip about. Do you not realize how self conscious teenagers are about puberty? If your son started \"exploring\" his body and told you, would you go tell your mother? Not telling your daughter's business is not the same thing as keeping secrets, and it's absolutely ridiculous for you to try and paint it as so. You only said that to make yourself not seem like the AH. YTA! YTA! YTA!\n\nBy the way, YTA!", "YTA but get it\u2026 I have a tween and it\u2019s been an adjustment recently as she\u2019s asked for more privacy. They\u2019re not babies anymore where we can tell the family about their first day of preschool etc. they\u2019re growing into young ladies and we should respect their privacy and boundaries, especially about big important life events.", "YTA. \n\nIf a Thing didn\u2019t happen to you, it\u2019s not your Thing to share.", "YTA - its already a difficult time for a girl that age and you make it 10 times worse by telling people her very personal business.", "I had mine around your daughter's age. My parents thought it was a good idea to share the \"news\" with my grand parents. That was the end of my trust in my parents. They never heard anything about any other thing that happened in my life. That was almost 60 years ago and I still haven't forgotten their breach of trust. \n\nYTA You just lost your daughter's trust.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019ve always found out my nieces got theirs on day one. Not because their parents told me but because they called me for sympathy and I took them out for \u201cpoor me\u201d dinner. We have that kind of relationship. They tell me things all the time. We check in with each other all the time. \n\nIf they didn\u2019t know it\u2019s because your daughter didn\u2019t feel the need or want to tell them. I can see why she didn\u2019t tell them. I would be mortified too if every person knew because my grandmother couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut because dad also inherited that inability. \n\nAlso it\u2019s not a secret it\u2019s common sense. They know her age. They know it\u2019s coming. Most people just assume it\u2019ll happen and go with the flow when THEY bring it up. I\u2019m open about my period but don\u2019t talk to me about it unless I give you that right by talking about it first.", "YTA big time and if you don\u2019t apologize to her and promise to not share personal stuff with your family without her permission she may stop telling you things. My mom is also a huge overshare-r with her family and I learned very early on to not tell her things. I\u2019m 26 now and live in a different city and, while I do still talk to my mom and visit, I barely tell her anything about my personal life.", "YTA\n\nWhen I got my period for the first time my Aunty was staying with us and I was mortified that she knew what was going on, even though it was pretty unavoidable since she was the one closest when I called out for help. I was 12, and I would've just preferred my mum and dad be the only ones who knew at the time. I needed time to process this massive change in my body. \n\nI can't imagine how mortified your daughter must feel at knowing her extended family is talking about something so private without her having any say. This isn't about \"no secrets\", this is about a lack of consent and bodily autonomy. Something happened within your daughter's body, and you took it upon yourself to share that sensitive and private information without even asking her if she was okay with it.", "YTA - That is not information that anyone needs to know about. She is mortified. Is that how you want her to feel? Next time you receive sensitive information, don't pass it along to the town crier.", "Giant AH!", "> we don't keep secrets in this family\n\nShall your wife share when you two have sex? When you masturbate? Is it only a private matter when it concerns you?\n\n> but my wife took my daughter's side and said that in the future I should ask Anna before I share any details of her life with anyone, especially my mom who likes to share family information.\n\nYour wife is correct.\n\n> I really thought it wasn't an issue, but now I'm wondering\n\nAgain, imagine if your wife went to your mother, sharing that the two of you had sex, every time you had sex. Would you not be mortified? Or is that meant to be a secret?\n\nOh, btw, neither of those are secrets. They are private details of your life that no one else has any entitlement to knowing. YTA. For both sharing, and acting like private information is a secret that needs to be shared.", "YTA.  Great job there, dad.  You told the village gossip something that the village gossip didn't need to know, and she spread it to the whole village.  You don't keep secrets in this family?  That's hilarious.   Now you've shown your daughter you aren't trustworthy and your mother can't keep her trap shut.", "YTA. I always hated it when my mom would tell family members about my medical issues. It\u2019s completely irrelevant if you think it\u2019s a big deal or not. You should respect your daughter\u2019s request for privacy and apologize.", "YTA. Ah yes, the mortification I suffered in 4th grade as my mother told every human being that would listen. Who told my friends parents because I started \"so young compared to others\". And the kids I played with said I wasn't a kid anymore and kicked me out of our **KidsNextDoor** club.\n\nAhhh good trauma.", "YTA. Why do you have to share stuff like that? And even more so your other family members that ran with it and told even more people. \n\nI used to get so pissed off at my mom that did the same, that it go to a point where I shared literally nothing with her cause she can\u2019t keep her mouth shut, and the worst of it was she would share both good and bad things with her church circle so they could \u201cpray\u201d for thanks or help. \n\nShe eventually caught up, saying I cut her out of my life and I don\u2019t share what is going on in my life anymore. Gee, I wonder why?", "YTA. Can I share your medical info since you don\u2019t seem to care about keeping such things private?\n\nBetter hope you kid doesn\u2019t grow up to be petty, cause I sure as hell would loudly share when my dad started having erection problems cause I found some blue pills in the cabinet. No secrets in the family right?", "Yta bigtime you have a preteen girl dealing with the big deal of having her period. You need to stfu and be supportive not make her feel exposed and ridiculed.  \nPreteen girls are delicate and vicious. Read a book or something", "YTA. You never share that info. I am glad she is comfortable or was comfortable with you, knowing,  but you don't tell others about periods. Some secrets need to be kept.", "YTA. This is what my parents did too and-although I love them dearly- I hated that they would share personal information with anyone.", "YTA. This is her first time and you need to ask before sharing. That being said there's nothing shameful about getting it, it's just better to ask for consent before sharing something personal like this.", "YTA- I know on TV and in movies getting your period results in a parade but in real life most women and girls like to be discrete about it.", "YTA. Unquestionaably\n\nMy mother is almost 80 and still talks about how her mother told her grandmother, who then spread the news that she'd started her periods to the entire family, and the fallout from that. How humiliated she was when the subject was discussed amongst the aunts and grandmothers right in front of her. How she was teased by them. How the male cousins found out and tormented her about it.... it was awful for her.  In fact, it was SO BAD that her younger sister made a point of Hiding her periods for Three Years!! To make certain she didn't have to go through what they put my Mom through. It only came out when their mother wanted to take her to a doctor to figure out why she wasn't having them!\n\nStarting your cycle is bad enough all by itself. It's worse that you have to talk about it with just the one or two people closest to you to figure out how to navigate both the physical aspects of it, nevermind how it affects you hormonally.  But to have the \"news\" broadcast to the family at large?  That's A Terrible thing to do to a Teenage Girl!!", "While I think we should normalize discussing menstruation, it\u2019s still personal information and a major change to your daughters life. A change she will need to get used to. \n\nAnd the excuse of \u201cwe don\u2019t keep secrets\u201d is just teaching her not to communicate anything to you in the future.  This is *not* what you want.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. I mean, look. You are man enough to talk about periods, and that\u2019s great. But you never should have said anything about your daughter getting her first period to anyone except maybe your wife and your daughter. This is new, it sucks, and there are many things that no matter how much you try to understand, a man just cannot understand this. You can be empathetic, but never fully understand.\n\nYou owe her a massive apology, and probably a shopping spree for being a total AH.", "YTA\n\nMy mom did this to me and it was humiliating for me. The worst part, all these decades later, is that it didn\u2019t bother her in the least that I was humiliated.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the many reasons we don\u2019t have a good relationship. Send your daughter flowers.", "Yta, yta, oh and yeah you\u2019re a **major ah** your daughters right, that\u2019s her PRIVATE information you just violated. Do better bc rn you\u2019re failing", "YTA.\n\n\"We don't keep secrets in this family\" is just code for \"I don't respect privacy.\"\n\nAnd newsflash OP, your family is absolutely fucking keeping secrets from you, especially since it seems like you and your side of the family have blather mouths.", "YTA not your body, not your info to share.", "Yta. I have horrendous second-hand embarrassment. I'm a mom and grandma. I can guarantee that you just destroyed all the trust that your daughter had in you.", "Yeah mild YTA. She\u2019s going into her teens years now so she\u2019s going to want some say in what personal info about her does or does not get shared.", "NO UTERUS, NO OPINION. YTA. It\u2019s not a big deal to you but it is to her. Her life just changed and she probably feels really uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t need you blabbering to the whole family. Periods are traumatic and you really just broke trust with your daughter", "YTA. I don't even know where to begin. It's a personal private matter. She gets to choose who knows that sort of thing about her body. (Usually) minors shouldn't keep secrets from their guardians. So she should be comfortable telling you and her mom stuff. But she won't be if you then spread it to the rest of the family. You broke the trust. That's what makes people start to keep secrets", "Yes YTA and really don\u2019t see anything wrong on what you did? Goooooood meeeeen *scream and pulls her hair*", "YTA. Not your experience to discuss. My mom did this and I was mortified. She has to figure out how to navigate this and before she even has a chance to wrap her head around it half the town knows. Don't do that. You and grandma are both AHs for flapping your gums.", "You are SUCH a huge asshole wtf why are you talking to your mom about your daughters periods weirdo. Your mom is an asshole too. YTA all day why in the world would *YOU* think you have the right to dictate how a 12 year old girl feels about her period?", "YTA. So should your daughter tell all your extended family when you have nighttime emissions or something??? Weird that you think discussing her bodily stuff with others is okay.", "YTA as is the toxic \"we don't keep secrets\" nonsense. This phrase is appropriate for parents with their young children to protect against predators/abuse. It is NOT appropriate for a pre-teen who has the right to refuse consent to discuss intimate aspects of her body with others.

But it\u2019s up to her to do that, not me and I would never tell family members outside of this house. Again, that\u2019s up to HER. You should apologize to her and tell your sister and mom to shut it.", "YTA I\u2019m grown as hell and only discuss my period with my doctor and maybe my sister.

It is an unwelcome visitor every month for anywhere from 5-10 days. \n\nYou told your mother something *very private* that your daughter is experiencing and she blabbed it to the whole damned family and probably all her neighbors and friends.  Why is it important that everyone on the planet knows your daughter is menstruating? When Anna gets older and feels comfortable talking about menstruation that is when *she* will talk about it and it will be with people she feels comfortable discussing it with.   \n\nDude, I know guys who would be too embarrassed to buy tampons or pads for their mom or sisters. Everyone knows *they* aren't using them but they get embarrassed.  I hated when my mom made me run to the store to buy them for her.  Like I wanted people thinking I am bleeding?  When you are young everything is embarrassing.   Not for you to say whether or not she should be embarrassed about a normal body function.  She is!  This is new to her and it takes a long time to get over that feeling of embarrassment for many girls.  jfc I can't believe any parents actually discuss this with others.  \n\nTell me, if you had erectile dysfunction and your daughter found out, would you be okay with her telling everyone she sees that you can't get it up anymore?   I'm trying to think of something that has a similar stigma to dudes and this is as close as I can think of offhand.", "YTA\n\nThe issue isn't whether you kept a secret, but this was not NEWS to be shared, and it is private information that it wasn't yours to disclose. It doesn't matter if it's normal, it's not your information to decide to keep or tell. \n\nAnd YOU don't get to decide what feels awkward or private for another person. Even your kid.\n\nMake sure you follow up and apologize, and make clear to your mom and your sister that you didn't have her permission to tell them. My guess is they assumed you did.

When me and my mom got home I told her I never wanted her to tell the family my business like that when I get my period. After that interaction, I was horrified of having to tell my mom when I got my period. I watched so many YouTube videos about having to tell your parents about your period because I was traumatized that my mom was going to gossip about it and make fun of me despite her telling me she would never do what my aunt did. I\u2019m sure your daughter will never fully trust you with sensitive information like that.

A 12 yr old has some right to her bodily autonomy. There is a reason why pediatricians talk to young girls PRIVATELY, in the absence of both parents. They talk about things like puberty and periods privately. Why? Because it's their body and times have changed. \n\nFor you it was a mild annoyance, for her it was embarrassing and made her very frustrated.

It's quite literally a symbol of the body sexually maturing, and heavily linked to childbirth. The most intimate process for a women.  An erectile dysfunction, isn't necessary \"sex life\", it's a sexual malfunction, or a sexual process. \n\nHowever, if you believe an erectile dysfunction is \"sex-life\" and shouldn't be shared, then periods  also shouldn't be shared, because they are quite literally an indication of the body sexually maturing. \n\nI don't understand the notion of sharing when your daughter gets her period, and then have other adults gossiping on a 12 yr old period cycle. It's so highly invasive and unnessecary to share. \n\nWould you like it if someone were to share when you pee and poop? Probably not, because the thought of that invades your privacy and body.\n\nFinally its not about how you felt when you had your period. It's about how OP's daughter felt.
