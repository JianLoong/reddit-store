Your husband isn't a babysitter for his own kids, he's a parent. If he doesn't want the other kiddos over, fine, but he's standing in the way of you helping your friend.\n\nI hope he never wants a night out and for you to have to put your kids to bed and give them dinner alone.", "It seems to me that you came up with a very reasonable compromise. Why can't your husband handle his own two kids for a few hours?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why the hell can't he feed his own children and put them to bed by himself? And it's just for one night!!", "NTA\n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t want to give your kids dinner & put them to bed BY HIMSELF?!! This alone makes him a huge a-hole!\n\nI bet if you\u2019d have suggested you bring your own kids to your friends, your husband would be more than happy with that since he\u2019ll be getting alone time \ud83d\ude12\n\nHelp your friend out. I\u2019d probably say go ahead and go over to your friend\u2019s house and babysit the kids there. It\u2019ll be less disruptive for them.  AND tell your husband to do his duty as a father and take care of the kids!\n\nPs. He may guilt you by saying something like how you\u2019re picking someone else\u2019s kids over your own....  don\u2019t listen to that bs. Just tell him enjoy bonding with the kids. Lol", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s their father. He should be perfectly capable of making them dinner and putting them to bed himself for one night. If he can\u2019t do that then you have bigger issues.", "NTA.  It sounds like you have come up with a reasonable compromise.  It is only 1 night and I really don't understand why he can't feed and put HIS children to bed 1 night without you.", "NTA. Your husband is being selfish and doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for his children. There are two problems here:\n\n1. Your husband is being selfish about the \u201cpeace and quiet\u201d of your home. He doesn\u2019t want you to have other children there, because he doesn\u2019t want to be inconvenienced by the noise and the kids running around and having fun. He\u2019s being immature, and if he is a good husband/friend then he should be willing to be mildly inconvenienced to help someone that you care about. \n\n2. He sounds like the kind of husband that uses the sentence \u201cI have to babysit\u201d when he\u2019s left with his own children. He thinks he\u2019s entitled to have the kids and then make them your responsibility. I hate that kind of husband/father; if they\u2019re his children, then they\u2019re his responsibility as much as they are yours. He should be a part of putting them down and feeding them regardless of whether you\u2019re home or not, and he shouldn\u2019t act like a baby when he\u2019s given that responsibility fully occasionally. Children are the responsibility of BOTH parents, as they both made the kid, not just the mom. \n\nYour Husband is in the wrong. He\u2019s being incredibly selfish and immature about his own children and your friend. He needs to realize that and take some responsibility and be willing to be a help. Marriage is about being a partner to your spouse. Everything is shared responsibility, if something is important to you then it should be important to him for that reason alone.", "NTA, he doesn\u2019t want them at the house fine, he doesn\u2019t get to have his cake and eat it too.", "NTA \n\nsounds like your husband just doesn't want to take care of the kids. Help your friend out, I'm sure she'd do the same for you. Your husband can figure it out.", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing that the amount of times that you have put both the kids to bed by yourself is much much higher in comparison to him. If I were you i\u2019d tell him that him saying he doesn\u2019t want to feed the kids and put them to bed by himself made you feel like he needs more practice and you\u2019ll be letting him do it more from now on.", "NTA, you've currently offered him 2 solutions. neither of them he's liked, so if he's unwilling to find a compromise, then he just has to deal with whatever you decide.", "NTA - reasonable for him to not want them in the house. Not reasonable for him to not wanna take care of his own kids.", "WTF?  Tell your husband to daddy up! He doesn\u2019t want to make mac n cheese and put jammies on the kids without adult supervision? Why is he a dad? NTA", "Your friend needs a favour and your husband is an asshole if he cannot take care of his own children for one evening. How pathetic. NTA.", "Does your husband get evenings to himself or do the both of you always take care of your children and their bedtime rituals together? Because if the answer  to the first question is \"yes\u201c and the answer to the second is anything but a \" yes\" then your hubby has to realise that taking care of his own kids isn't babysitting but being an effing parent.\nIf there aren't any special circumstances why he wouldn't be able to do this alone, you're clearly NTA", "NTA, if your husband isn't capable of taking care of his own children that is very worrying though.\n\nYou could take the kids with you, or try to find a sitter for them.", "NTA. You gave a reasonable compromise option for a one-time, short duration situation, and he\u2019s unwilling to solo parent.", "NTA and your husband is a huge red flag", "NTA. I assume it's a one off. If your friend was asking for a long term situation, then, it wouls be something to talk about and compromise on.  Your husband can take care of HIS kids for one night-", "NTA. Your husband should certainly be able to feed, bath, do the bedtime routine and get your little ones to sleep for 1 night. Go help your friend. Moms helping Moms makes the world go round.", "NTA. I understand your husband not wanting 3 more little ones at the house. I don't understand his inability/desire to take care of HIS children. He's being ridiculous.", "NTA. I agree with your husband about it being chaotic for your own children, but you offered a completely reasonable compromise and that's when he turned into a child himself.", "Going against the grain and saying soft YTA. Everyone seems stuck on raising the kids being his job too. It\u2019s also yours and you made a unilateral decision and expect him to pick up your slack/or watch other peoples kids. If you want to help a friend that\u2019s fine but if it means someone else has to do your share of the housework for that time or more work in general it is your responsibility to have their agreement first. In short your friends issues are not your husbands and it\u2019s not on him to help out with it or cover you so you can do it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
