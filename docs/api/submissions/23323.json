Most people do have a vision of how they would like their wedding day to feel, look, flow, etc. As an event planner I would advise & encourage your sister to let this go because she is asking you to do something that will make you uncomfortable & you won\u2019t be able to enjoy the wedding. That will change the ambiance of the wedding. People should feel happy to be there not forced to be uncomfortable. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s your responsibility to create the perfect day for your sister.
