Look, I get that it's all about the bride, but the bride needs to realize that isn't an excuse to make unreasonable requests.  It's not like asking if you could wear (say) a blue dress instead of a green dress, because the hair coloring will remain for a long time.  \n\nAlso, if she's OK with her mom's purple hair, it seems there is something deeper personally and the hair color is just an excuse.", "NTA, but if you know anyone else attending see if they'll dye their hair for the event...", "Im guessing photos play a big part in this too. I dont get why people want lies to be included in their wedding photos. It\u2019s disingenuous. Like photos are meant to not only remember the day, but the life surrounding the day. Like when they look back on their wedding photos together (OP and the sis), OP should be able to say \u201coh this was back when i dyed my hair green\u201d (if op ever dyes a different color in the future). Instead of \u201cand there\u2019s me looking like not me\u201d or how it is heading \u201ci wasnt there because you obsessed over my hair color\u201d.", "Ah yes, the thing everyone wants to wear to a wedding - stiff as hell hair that rubs off on everything and drips down your neck if you sweat.", "Dudes groomzilla out too man", "\"Temporary\" hair dye on bleached hair often isn't.", "Semi-permanent or even demi/temporary dye on bleached hair often sticks around way longer than expected and can be a pain in the ass to get out.", "spittin fax rn", "NTA obviously, it was kind of you to make the offer to change it at all. \n\nBut I have to ask: how do you manage to not have utterly fried hair if your natural colour is darker brown and you've been green for 3-4 years continuously? Mine's dark brown and I would have to bleach the living shit out if it before it would take a bright colour.", "was colorimg her hair something new after wedding plans began or did she go out of character for her and gets green hair for the first time ever I understand the bride. If she has had green hair (or regularly  has colored her hair) then the bride should not be surprised as it is normal behavior and shouldnt be a big deal.", "Tell me OP is more conventionally attractive than her sister without telling me she is more attractive than her sister. I'd guess sis is jealous of prettier younger sister and is trying to dull her up.", "Yesss get one of those ridiculous OTT mullet wigs. And a false moustache.", "Some dark hair just bleaches easily. And once you've bleached it once, you don't need to do it again besides your roots.", "Yep!", "And that \u201cperfect\u201d wedding.", "NTA. This shit is petty and irrelevant to having you actually physically present at the wedding. If you are not a bridesmaid then it\u2019s even less of a distraction. You\u2019ll just be with all of the other guests. This is dumb. Bridezillas are a real thing!", "NTA. Tell that child you'll go to her next one.", "nta", "Wear a wig as a compromise.", "Nope. Your family are assholes", "NTA. Be happy :)", "Hence why i recommended one I know doesn't", "You do not know her hair well enough to say that.", "NTA. You are 100% respecting her wishes by not attending- she presented you with 2 options and you picked one", "NTA. It may be her wedding day, but that doesn't make her God. If she can't accept you for how you are, and the way you want to look with your hair (especially a style/color you've had for years), then fuck her.\n\nThis all goes far beyond the normal bride stuff, imo. Like I get matching outfits and all that. But those are something you can easily take off. Her wanting you to semi permanently change your appearance for one day is beyond stupid.\n\nHonestly, you tried working with her. The color you choose and the wig idea were both reasonable. At this point, she's putting her petty wants ahead of your feelings as a person. Really, I would avoid her as much as possible. This sounds like more than a wedding issue to me, it sounds like she doesn't accept you for who you are or respect you as a person.\n\nBut that's just my two cents on it.", "NTA. You literally offered to dye it blonde which is a natural hair colour", "NTA. It is NEVER okay for a bride to demand that a wedding guest change something fundamental to their regular appearance. \n\nThe fact that you offered to wear a wig and she refused that says that there's more to her demand than the colour of your hair. For some odd reason, she wants to exert control over you by forcing you to dye your hair the specific colour that she wants you to have. I'm fairly certain that choosing a colour that would make it difficult to change back to your preferred colour is deliberate. It's sad that your parents cannot see the situation for what it is. Your sister is trying to disrespect you, and they are supporting her in the attempt. Good on you for standing your ground.", "NTA.  I'm always 100% on the side of the people getting married and what they want, but asking you to go a specific hair color, but not allowing a wig is completely unreasonable.  It's clearly an excuse to disinvite you without having the courage to admit it.", "NTA. Your mother has purple hair. You offered to wear a wig. I think your sister doesn't want you at the wedding and figured out a way to 1) have you not attend and 2) make  you the bad guy. Do something fun with friends and block everyone who is giving you grief.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "Yup. All of this, right here. Well said.", "Right I think it\u2019s a little crazy if you\u2019re just a guest. Unpopular opinion, I could see why she would feel that way if she were a bridesmaid though (I recently got married and I had trouble getting people not to wear JEANS). But saying no to a wig?? Seems silly.", "Why would that matter", "It will come back to her OP. Because she don't wanna dye her hair.", "You sound fun!", "Nta.  People aren't dolls to color on and dress up, and this trend of demanding your kin be dolls in your wedding is gross.", "NTA \nNog to be cruel, but fact that she wouldn\u2019t be okay with blonde hair or a wig either makes it seem like she didn\u2019t want to invite you in the first place and this gave her a way to make you not go while being able to say that you were invited", "NTA\n\nIn spite what many a bride may think, their weddings are generally little more than a sticky note on a specific day in a random year. It might be their \"most important day\", but it's nobody elses. If anything, the more pressure any individual in the wedding party puts on random figures to fulfill various asinine requirements the more they'll obsess over those requirements not being met. Basically, your sister is setting herself up for your absence living rent free in her head until the day she dies. She might blame you and say, \"I'll never forgive this,\" but it's really her fault at the end of the day for being that way. she made it an issue.", ">I think this is the parents' way of trying to get OP to have \"normal\" hair color\n\nI don't think this is the case, because of this:\n\n> our mom's hair is dyed a dark purple color", "op=NTA\n\nIt doesn't even sound like you were asked to be a member of the wedding party.\n\nShe told you her conditions for attendance-dye hair(um NO).  \n\nEven for member of wedding party--bride needs to be upfront.  ie I want you to be bridesmaid but none of your tattoos can show.  Because then potential bridesmaid can NOPE out(same with expenses--this will cost you 1000s of dollars--People asked to be bridesmaid need to say, *I'd love to but I need to know what you are expecting.  I could only budget 500 dollars for dress, accessories, styling, parties, and gift*).\\[Tirade over\\]\n\nThat said, she seems to want you to be only a guest and still wants to control your appearance, you said no thank you to that and were gracious(here at least) about your refusal.\n\nPlus she wants NO compromises(I have feeling that you would look better as a blonde/wearing wig than she would look as a bride).", "NTA\n\nFuck bridezillas", "Dude. You get a free pass to not go to some stupid wedding. Take it. Nta", "NTA\n\nThere are those spray temporary colors. It washes right out. I know you said you aren\u2019t going and it doesn\u2019t matter, just thought I\u2019d mention. \n\nI shaved my head shortly before my mom got remarried and she was pissed.", "I am guessing the sister is not Really okay with her mom having dyed hair either but is in no position culturally, financially, or high enough in the social hierarchy to make such a demand of the mother.

And everyone that is supporting her against her little sister would definitely flip and call her out of line and ungrateful to her mother if she did."]}
