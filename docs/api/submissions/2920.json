He says it is because he couldn\u2019t remember the information. We decided he will just transfer his portion of the bills to the joint account each week. While has had paid some here and there it has not been consistent and he has used the joint bank account to supplement when he runs out of money. At first it wasn\u2019t much, but it got to the point where if it was in the account he was spending it. I can understand after not having play money for of his own it would be harder to budget. So we talked again, I set some clear boundaries. Even though his name is on the account, the money in that account (beyond bills) is mine to use since he has his own private account that I do not have access to. If he is running out of money, before he gets paid he needs to figure out his budget. He apologized said he would pay back the extra that he spent and start giving me the money for bills the day he got paid. He has yet to pay the money back, he did stay out of the bank account for for a bit and then spent a moderate amount of money. He said he used the wrong card by accident , and decided to give me his debit card. Two weeks later he went to the bank and withdrew money. At that I changed my direct deposit and closed the account without telling him. When he found out he was livid. He told me how selfish I am, how I embarrassed him at the bank (b/c he was trying to withdrawal from an account that no longer exists). That I am financially abusing him. I feel as though he was taking advantage of me and my income, but according to him and his family it was wrong for me to close the account we are supposed to share funds and how dare I leave him without access to that money what if there was of an emergency etc etc. I talked to him multiple times, set boundaries and acted when those boundaries were crossed, but I guess I could be the asshole for not telling him before I closed the account.", "created_utc": 1669069432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1caez/aita_for_closing_the_joint_bank_account_that_only/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are NTA.\n\nFirst, he has is own account and that's where is salary his going. He's only taking money OUT of the joint account, not adding any. If he made a mistake, then surely that mistake can be corrected by moving the money he intended to spend out of his personal account into the joint, but he's not doing that. \n\nYou're on the receiving end of financial abuse the way I read it.\n\nEdit: I just re-read this and two things: Financial Abuse would be if he had zero income and was solely dependent on you, the dude has a job and his own bank account which he drains then hits up yours. What's happening to you is called stealing.", "NTA.  I hope you opened two new accounts:\n\n1) personal checking account he has no access to\n\n2) divorce slush fund\n\nThis man was stealing from you, broke every single one of his promises, and did this all (presumably) after years of being supported entirely by you.  You are not an AH for taking very basic actions to protect yourself.", "He wouldn't have known the account was closed if he hadn't been [yet again] trying to take money he wasn't supposed to blow and had already said he wouldn't touch.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact that he called you the financial abuser while actively abusing you financially is very concerning. I would look into marriage counseling. That's just not in the realm of ok.", "NTA. If your finances are separate its not his money, end of. \n\nI would be very careful about your money in a relationship like this, don\u2019t let him get near your debit/credit cards or have your online banking information. He\u2019ll keep spending and spending until you have nothing left. Then blame you for not supporting him financially. \n\nHe\u2019s got his own job now, his own money, if he can\u2019t budget that\u2019s on him. Don\u2019t give in to him and his family or you\u2019ll be paying for everything for the rest of your relationship.", "Let\u2019s be honest, he set up his direct deposit like that intentionally because he knew you would pick up the slack and he could spend his and your money on whatever he wants. Then make you feel like you are in the wrong if you try to correct the behaviour. My SIL\u2019s ex was exactly like this and no matter what she did, he would not change. Two separate times during their 10 years married, she found out he had secret credit cards where he had racked up thousands in debt. I advise you to keep a close eye on your credit score in case he does the same. NTA", "NTA..he actually said he couldn't set up direct deposit because he couldn't recall the info? It's literally printed at the bottom of your deposit tickets..or your checks..or any deposit reciept you get from the bank.", "NTA\n\nSo you're supposed to be sharing funds?\n\nI would say you should have opened a New account for yourself and kept the joint account, but you gotta do what you gotta do.\n\nHubs needs to figure his budget out. How could he be spending his whole paycheck on something when before he was unemployed?!! Very Sus IMO", "NTA he wants everything his way, he has lied to you and is using your money without discussing it with you. Best to have separate accounts and for him to pay his share ie certain bills are his to deal with.\n Is there any chance he is gambling I only ask because this is quite sneaky and devious behaviour along with the attempt to make it seem like it is your fault for closing the account to deflect from the fact he was trying a new way to get to the money behind your back.", "NTA and if anything HE is the one financially abusing YOU by spending all of your money and not even contributing to the household. If you have bank statements, take pictures or screenshot and send them to his family showing YOU are the only one who contributed to that account and he didn't contribute anything.", "Usually I would say... find a therapist. But, it seems like your husband is taking advantage of you. I hope you sign a prenup.", "It is time to run a credit check and lock all of your credit down.  Secure your valuables and anything that can be pawned, sold, given as a gift to someone else, etc.  You are in financial jeopardy, at risk of becoming liable for any and all debts he incurs.  He quit contributing for half your marriage and now that he has a job, he is hoarding all of his gold and trying to steal yours.  Such gratitude.  Protect yourself now.

NTA", "NTA Unless I\u2019m misreading, your husband wants to keep all his money, and then spend yours that is supposed to go to bills for his own additional expenses. Two things that stand out clearly as massive red flags outside the obvious is one trying to claim to be the victim of financial abuse, when it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s dependent on you for money, he\u2019s just mad you\u2019re not funding whatever he\u2019s wasting his funds on. Secondly, the fact that you mention your ILs have an opinion, why is a grown ass man running to his family to complain about his wife?", "NTA\u2014OP, why are you still married to this dude?", "NTA.  He was taking advantage and being dishonest after you expressed co cern and asked him to stop .", "NTA\n\nLOL at them saying you should be sharing funds when he literally refuses to have his income go to the joint account.\n\nIf he wants shared funds then his wages need to go into a joint account to,cover bills (and I would suggest he doesn't get access to it) and then a set/equal amount for both of you goes into personal,accounts. \n\nSounds like he got very used to you paying his way, being sick and unable to work is not his fault but his behaviour now is.", "NTA. Can we say Epic Gaslight Fail??!", "NTA.  He is stealing from you.  He needs money?  He can use his own.", "You are definitely NTA. You discussed your concerns multiple times, but he kept taking money from you and it sounds like he\u2019s still not paying his portion of the bills. He should be embarrassed!", "NTA. How can you be financially abusing him when you do not have access to his money? He could easily have set up a direct debit from his account to the joint account to money in every week. Plus most banking can now be done online so no excuse with the \"I can't remember the details\". You will have to set up clear rules about who is responsible for paying which bill.", "Nta. It was not shared money as he wasn't putting money in there.

I would suggest marriage counseling and if he says no (and he will) then you need to get out of the marriage before your finances become more entwined. I would be concerned about where he is spending this money considering you are paying all the expenses.", "Minor AH for not telling him *after* you closed the account. He's not acting like he's trustworthy with a joint account, even if he was direct depositing. Sounds like he'd drain it. Keep separate accounts. Might be a good idea to split the bills too. Some in your name, some in his. So he and you have to settle the accounts each month.", "NTA.

She'll use my account, then immediately send me money in Zelle.\n  \nEasy peasy. If you really don't want to take advantage of someone.
