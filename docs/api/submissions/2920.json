I have never deposited a check during my entire life, almost 40 years. I also have only deposited cash once during my whole life (due to old coins falling out of use). The information may be printed on some rare papers I get from the bank but I am not sure and those go directly in the garbage. It is very possible that he would need to go to the bank to know what his account number is.\n\nThe real issue is that he could just have asked his wife for it.", "My ex husband was similar.  I paid for everything for the majority of the relationship and when he did get a job he rarely paid half. The agreement was he would pay me back one day.  I did all housework except dog walking and worked full time. He admitted using my credit cards without permission for a while.  We split up not long after it became very clear that he was using me for money and as someone to do all the chores etc.\n\nWhen we divorced, my flat (full mortgage and deeds in my name, he often for the bit of the relationship where he was actually earning did not pay his full half of bills) was sold as by law he was entitled to half my belongings just as we were married, and he threatened to give up his job and demand I pay him a wage essentially. He comes from money with parents frequently bailing him out. No money in my family and only money I've ever had I've earned through me working.  He never paid any of the money he owed me back and would often spend his part tie job wage on computer stuff and not have enough for his half or run out of cash so I'd need to cover him.\n\nPeople like this sadly don't change and it's awful to have been on the receiving end of them  I hope your SIL is living their best life without that deadweight around her neck x\n\n\\*Edited to also say my ex also had tons of credit cards etc he'd racked up buying crap for himself that he did not need like games etc.  I took out a loan in my name to pay them off which thankfully he did pay me back for but think it was only because he was scared I'd tell his mother about his debt and drugs habit if he didn't!", "It won\u2019t matter. She could have all the proof in the world and they\u2019ll still defend theft, abuse, and lies.", "Even if he earns minimum wage, he shouldn\u2019t need 100% of his earnings + whatever\u2019s left in his wife\u2019s account for fun money. She\u2019s still paying all the bills!", "You do not need to know it when doing withdrawals if you do them at the bank. Where I live it is enough to have a valid photo ID document. Of course while doing the withdrawal you will likely get a receipt with the account number and if not you can just ask them.", "I do for one of my bank accounts actually, but generally, no. He could also just have asked his wife. Plus don't most banks today allow you to log in into the internet bank and check your account details?", "Classic story, wife supports man through illness. Dude improves health wise and immediately cheats. Claims it\u2019s wife\u2019s fault that their sex life faded when she had to act as earner and caregiver.", "I have mixed feelings about this one. \n\n===\n\nFirst, you're obviously NTA and he obviously is a big one. \n\n===\n\nThat said, that's not how a joint account works. This is a shared account, hence the name. Whoever feeds it doesn't matter, it is *shared*. You shouldn't have put that much money on that account in my opinion. The only fact you were able to close this account without his consent is beyond my understanding. In my country, the bank would requires both signatures to close a joint account.", "NTA. You should close your whole marriage.", "NTA He is a golddigger. I bet he's faking being sick to steal your money", "NTA and remind him he still owes you money.", "INFO he didn't have any play money during the two years he was unable to work. Did you have play money during that time?", "NTA. He\u2019s the one financially abusing you. I went through very similar with my ex. I refused to combine funds with her because her idea of budgeting was to pay the bills and spend the rest. We set up a joint account that we were each supposed to pay a set amount into for expenses such as our combined car insurance, cell phones, etc. She often didn\u2019t do it and sometimes even spent some of the money. I would go to pay the car insurance and there wouldn\u2019t be enough in the account to cover it, so I\u2019d have to make up the difference because she didn\u2019t have any money saved. I put up with that crap longer than I should have. This man is financially abusing you. Take whatever steps necessary to ensure it doesn\u2019t continue.", "NTA\n\nTechnically it is your account because you are the only one putting money into it.\n\nIf anyone is doing the financial abusing it would be your husband for spending your money", "Wth did I just read?  He is p*ssed because he no longer has access to a bank account and the funds he does not contribute to?  Literally stealing in plain sight.  A fireable offense.", "I\u2019m surprised you were allowed to close a joint account without his signature.", "NTA. Time to turn the tides on this one. He was clearly taking advantage of you and abusing the situation. You had discussions with him in which you set very clear boundaries.  He ignored the boundaries and carried on. You did what you needed to do in order to financially protect both of you. There is nothing wrong in that. All those funds can now be placed in a separate savings in your name only for future emergency use. I would still insist he pay back what he used.", "NTA. If he didn't feel the need to confer with you before making a withdrawal, why should you?", "NTA. You just took your money and put it into an account that he doesn't have access to because he was taking your money instead of using his own and \n\n>what if there was of an emergency etc etc.\n\nSince he's taking your money without so much as a text to let you know. \n\n     IF anyone is being financially abusive in the relationship its definitely him.", "You are most definitely NTA", "Technically she doesn't even know if he drains his first. She can't see it - he may be using her funds to spend while saving his.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, when two parties divorce they are both obligated to disclose a list of their assets including bank accounts.", "There's actually a term for it: DARVO. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender."]}
