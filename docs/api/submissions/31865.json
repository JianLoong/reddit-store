I'd have thought you'd be more grateful as your parents are dead and you're adopted now.\"\n\nI asked her to apologize immediately as I could see that it had really hurt him, but she just shrugged and said, \"Well, if you want to have it, go ahead. I don't care anyway.\" But I told her \"You are going to care because your birthday's cancelled, we're headed back.\" I asked them to head back to the car and she yelled at me and said she was just joking, that I cannot do that, etc.\n\nWe had a really huge argument but in the end I got back them back to the car.

Additionally, her behavior should have been handled the VERY FIRST time she said something like that. Not on the 2, or 3, or 4th time.

This happens with biological siblings too, we know this. They just can't be as harsh.\nTo be fair I was told by my brothers that I was adopted, they were teens and I was toddler age. I was practically identical to them, so I knew I wasn't. \nThey were struggling with my existence and the way the family changed after I was born.  They loved me but were kids so when emotions got high they would be mean for lack of better skills.\n\nYou and your wife have failed your children. \nGet them into therapy individually, immediately, and get into family therapy. \nIf you can't afford it, you should not have adopted a child because that's an essential part of adopting, especially when you have a child already in the home.\n\nAlso, have you ever tried asking your daughter why she says hurtful things?

I have another child, Ethan, (10 M) who's adopted. Rachel insists that he's not a \"proper\" member of family as he's not related to us. My wife Emily and I had attempted to convince her (although it was mostly I who did), but it had not worked so we gave it up.\n\nWe had planned to have lunch at a restaurant and we took the car. Ethan wanted to sit in front, but Rachel told him \"Sorry, but only proper members of the family get to sit in front, and you're not *really* their child.\"\n\nHe was shocked, and I asked her to take back what she had said, but my wife asked me to not start an argument as it was her birthday. Ethan did sit back with Emily in the back, and so I did not argue.\n\nWe went to the restaurant, and she wanted an expensive dish. I ordered it, and Ethan said that he wants the same stuff. But Rachel did not like that, she said:\n\n\"You want an expensive dish when he's not even your Dad in reality? I'd have thought you'd be more grateful as your parents are dead and you're adopted now.\" \n\nI asked her to apologize immediately as I could see that it had really hurt him, but she just shrugged and said, \"Well, if you want to have it, go ahead. I don't care anyway.\" But I told her \"You are going to care because your birthday's cancelled, we're headed back.\" I asked them to head back to the car and she yelled at me and said she was just joking, that I cannot do that, etc.\n\nWe had a really huge argument but in the end I got back them back to the car. My wife says that although what she said was distasteful, cancelling her birthday was extremely uncalled for and she's mad at me for having ruined her day completely.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Did you bring this boy to your family to be emotionally abused?  Because that\u2019s what is happening.", "NTA, near ESH. This has obviously been going on without effective action and the reason you get NTA is for finally taking strong action. Your wife is enabling your daughter in openly bullying Ethan in a truly horrific way and regularly.  The fact your wife isn't trying to stop her, framed it as 'distasteful' rather than completely unacceptable in every way, and thinks it's less important than a birthday makes me really, really concerned about what's being said when you aren't home, both by your daughter and your wife. I mean, your daughter felt perfectly safe to bully Ethan right there in the car in front of her parents. You and your wife need to be in counselling to sort out what's going on with her attitude toward Ethan and the whole family needs to be in counselling together once you and your wife are on the same page.\n\nI'm really confused as to how you could have an 11 year old daughter with your wife, but a child who's one year younger seems to be 'your'  adopted son rather than both of your adopted son, but maybe that's just phrasing. Doesn't change the situation in actionable terms bit the implications of why you might have phrased it that way aren't great.\n\nGood for you for sending a strong message to Ethan about his importance to you, because I'm sure he got the message from your wife that she doesn't feel the same and cares far more for her biological daughter. I think there's an additional problem, though, and that's how you can protect Ethan by making sure he's not alone with them until all this is sorted out. Ethan may also need individual therapy to help him with the ongoing abuse/bullying and the fact that it was allowed to go on with little issue for what is clearly awhile. His feelings about his place in the family are probably terrible. I think it goes without saying that if counselling doesn't work and your wife won't accept Ethan as her son, you need to leave with him, because 8 more years of this are not to be considered.\n\nRe: edit that Ethan has been there a year.  Welp, if your wife said the was ok with that, she was lying. Nothing in my take changes. This family needs therapy desperately. Rachel prob feels replaced by Ethan as a son that she may think you prefer, your wife clearly didn't and still doesn't want him and a year's worth of acrimony is boiling out. The bottom line is that you took responsibility for Ethan and it's up to you to make sure that he's healthy and happy.  That being said, I feel like we're missing information as to how and why Ethan came to be adopted, given your wife's behavior.", "I am wondering how your family got through the adoption process and were accepted as being able to offer a home to Ethan, to be honest.", "NTA.

Pretty sure if my parents had sprong another kid on me when I was 10 I would have been far worse as I barely accepted my biological brother until I was in my 20s.  \n\nBut expect this to be remembered FOREVER.

OP's daughter isn't secretly torturing and murdering people and animals. She's saying unkind things. Which . . . isn't exactly shocking coming from an 11 year old girl? You do know middle schooler have been known to say mean stuff?\n\nLook, I understand what OP's daughter is saying is really hurtful and I do wish she wouldn't say it. But this is not what evil looks like nor is it shocking for her age. Younger children/tween actually often are less good at empathy and considering others feelings when they themselves are upset then adults. And adults aren't always great at that either.\n\nIt's pretty clear that OP's daughter is fundamentally unhappy with a new person just  being added to her family and being told \"this is your brother now\". It dosen't sound like OP considered her feelings or if this would be a good match for her. She resents Ethan and maybe (not so) secretly hopes that she can drive him away and she can have the old family she was comfortable in back. It's one thing to feel bad for someone in need and be kind to them on the street or at a shelter or at school. It's another to be expected to live with them 24/7. It's a big ask, emotionally. Blending families dosen't always go well. That's, pretty normal actually. Also, from her point of view she's telling the truth. Ethan isn't her brother, someone can't just show up with a stranger boy she isn't comfortable around one day and declare he's her parents kid now and magically he is. That feels very wrong to her.\n\nAgain, I wish she was kinder to Ethan and it should be addressed. But this dosen't make her evil and it's not that shocking. I've worked at a middle school. Lots of 11 year old say unkind things to other kids their age, even when no one is moving into their house they don't want there.", "That\u2019s a huge change for a 10 year old.

If they can\u2019t prepare themselves that definitively means they don\u2019t prepare their children\n\nI wonder how involved OPs daughter was in the decision behind her brother being adopted. It would explain a lot of the hostility. \n\nI mean can you imagine just being told you have to deal with a stranger coming into your home and you have no say in it. Like she\u2019s 11 and probably had her life turned upside down\n\nMy brother is adopted and he had best case scenario with my parents.

Most children if spoken to before an adoption occurs, usually on board with it and see the kid as a sibling. The way she acting, her parents did not take  her feelings about the situation in account.

Negative reinforcement means to reinforce a behavior by taking away something bad.", ">I stand by the fact that OP & his wife are assholes that they let Rachel\u2019s behavior go unpunished until now.\n\nThey should be doing *something* but also punishing Rachel is likely going to make her hate Ethan more.\n\nIn fact, one of the biggest reasons she hates Ethan now is likely that OP and his wife originally punished her a bunch for her comments. (He said they did at first the gave up.) Ethan was a new person pushed into her family she was uncomfortable with. When Rachel rebelled against this, she was punished. Repeatedly. And every single time she built up resentment towards Ethan. Now her entire emotional association with Ethan is negative, since it's her stewing each time she was punished for saying he shouldn't be there/isn't a member of her family (her true feelings). \n\nAlso, it didn't work. You can't punish someone into loving someone else. You can't punish someone into accepting someone into the family. That's a \"punishments will continue until moral improves\" situation. \n\nI'm not saying the way Rachel treats Ethan is okay, either. But the situation is more complicated to me than \"Rachel needed more punishments\". Punishment is not a good way to make children love or like something/someone or share our values. It's basically not a solution to the actual underlying problem of Rachel resenting Ethan and feeling like he's imposing on her home/family, but likely to make it worse.", "She just turned 11, she's probably in elementary school.
