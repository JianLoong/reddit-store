{"id": 32848, "submission_id": "18fxsaw", "title": "AITA For not introducing my MIL as \"Grandma\" to my daughter?", "selftext": "So April last year my Husband and I got married and the night before the wedding we organised a Dinner so we could have a bit of a catch up with those who could make it as most of his family lived over 8 hours away and my daughter had been born and was 6 months old at the time and had not met anyone other than a couple of people.\n\nThe night of the Dinner we were driving to the restaurant when my daughter thought now was a great time to do a poo \ud83e\udd23. But instead of going straight the the toilet to clean her up, a BIL and SIL were waiting for us at the entrance of the restaurant. So instead of being rude I went in to see the whole in-law family who were already at the restaurant which included Oma, Opa, MIL two BIL and a SIL and introduce them quickly to my daughter \"Hiiiii, this is 'daughter'. Sorry we have to rush off to the toilet as she decided to do a poo in the car.\" And I whisked her away to freshen her bum.\n\nOnce I had gotten back they were gone to order food and drinks (type of restaurant you got up to the counter to pay and get a buzzer and pick up your food yourself) so I sat down and started talking to my friend who asked to hold my daughter. The night progressed as normal food and drinks all ordered and then arrived and once everyone had finished eating people were moving around the room a little bit and my 3 SIL asked to hold my daughter. And when they did this I asked my daughter \"would you like a cuddle with Aunty 'name'?\" And then pass her to them. But Oma, Opa and MIL did not leave their seats (they were on the other side of the room where it was more crowded with the chairs and tables. It was difficult to get to, to just stand there) they never asked to hold her they didn't even interact with anyone other then amongst themselves. (Talked German a fair bit actually, so couldn't understand or chim in to involve ourselves in the conversation). It was then getting late, both my daughter and myself were tired and I wanted an early one before my Wedding day. So we all said our goodbyes. And we said goodbye to everyone but they did not even get out of their seats let alone ask for a cuddle or anything. \n\nFast forward to 2 days after the wedding (which they left early as they were heading home early the next day). I message my MIL thanking her for travelling up for the Wedding and the gift, how lovely it was to see the family and hoping they all got home safe. She proceeds to reply with this and ONLY this \"We are not home we decided to make a holiday of this. We were so disappointed that we were not introduced to 'daughter' as Great-Grandma, Great-Grandad and Grandma\". \n\nIn short: I had a lot going on. So I think it mostly was an oversight on my part. But my MIL is bringing it up again a year and a half later and blaming it purely on me and I believe she implied I did it on purpose.

Don\u2019t give her a second thought, you will never win with someone like that. \n\nNTA", "This sounds like a job for your husband. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She's not just holding a grudge over something so minor, she's built a shrine to it so that she'll never forget and can bring it up after 1 1/2 years have gone by.\n\nPlus this grudge is over something that's her fault. They sat in a remote area speaking a language you don't understand, and never bothered to visit your table.\n\nShe deserves to be ignored. Let your husband deal with her.", "Poo takes precedence, that's the law of the land. \n\nAnd MIL can be upset with her son, not you, if she wanted an intro to the baby, because he is just as much the parent as you, and should be handling his own family. \n\nSo I'd just ignore her, and if she brings it up, simply say \"your son was also at this event, and he could have introduced you in any way you preferred, in your preferred language, to OUR daughter, so you had all night, plenty of opportunities, and your son present to spend time with our daughter.\"\n\nEnd of story. NTA.", "NTA. Baby literally would not remember or know if you introduced MIL as Iron Man. She's just trying to find something to be upset about. Besides it's typically a grandparents job to pick their grandparent name and get to know baby, not yours. As a mom, you have better shit to do than to facilitate a getting to know you session with your infant.", "NTA, especially if you\u2019ve already explained that it wasn\u2019t intended to be a slight.", "NTA you had a lot going on.  But where is your husband in all this?  Why didn't he take his child to meet his family?", "Where was your husband to be in all this? Surely this is his responsibility as it\u2019s his family? Definitely NTA but older conservative generations often think that their age entitles them to respect. It doesn\u2019t. Even stupid people can get old.", "NTA. You could have introduced them as Humpty Dumpty & the Tooth Fairy and it wouldn't have made a difference to your SIX MONTH OLD DAUGHTER. Of all the ridiculous reasons for 3 grown adults to throw a temper tantrum, this has gotta be at the top of the list!", "Nothing was stopping them from getting off their butts and walking over to say hello to you.\n\nThey were the rude people, only talking among themselves in a foreign language, and not speaking to you or anyone else in the room.  That BS is ALL ON THEM!\n\nNTA.\n\nGood luck dealing with her attitude in the future!", ">We were so disappointed that we were not introduced to 'daughter' as Great-Grandma, Great-Grandad and Grandma\n\ntell your MIL that your 6 month old daughter is more mature than her because even though it's obvious your daughter doesn't comprehend who they are, she's not making a big deal out of it.\n\nNTA, your MIL sounds terribly exhausting.", "Maybe grandma should have become better acquainted with baby by changing the poopy diaper.", "NTA. Good grief. I have multiple grandchildren and not once have I expected my child or child in law to bring said baby to me for a \u201cbaby, this is your grandmother.\u201d I just coo over the babies and hold them and cuddle them when I can and they figure out on their own who I am as they get older. Expecting a formal introduction to an infant is ludicrous and just looking for a reason to be mad. She needs to get over it.", "Wait, why didn't your HUSBAND take his daughter to meet his mother at their table? Why was it your responsibility? This does not fully fall on your shoulders.\n\nThat said, it was rude not to take a few minutes to introduce the baby to her grandparents and great grandparents. But I hold to the fact that it was your husband's responsibility.\n\nESH", "NTA. Oversights happen. We're all human. She needs to let it drop.

She could have come up to greet the baby.", "ESH. It doesn\u2019t sound like any of you bothered to discuss in advance what you wanted the grandparents/greatgrandparents to be called.

They are really holding on to grudge for something so minor.

What in the actual F?", "NTA\n\nThis is so picky and self centered. Why couldn't they come over to interact with y'all? You're not the only person involved in the interaction, so I'm a little confused why your husband or they themselves didn't show some initiative.", "NTA .  Mil just wants to be a pain.

There isn't much time to breathe. \nYour inlaws definitely felt slighted that after the diaper change, baby wasn't brought back over so they could properly meet her. \nIt sounds like it was a lowkey celebration dinner, but the fact that some of your guests were across the room at a table has me believing that this wasn't a well thought out pre-wedding dinner. And both your husband and you should have gone to interact with everyone that attended even for a few minutes. \nIt would have been easy to make actual reservations at a cheap restaurant for everyone to sit together. It would have been even easier to go sit with your inlaws with your daughter for a few minutes and let them properly meet your daughter. \nBy you, I mean you and/or your husband.", "This.

But we tried reaching out to her after this and checking up on the family and she would barely reply let alone ask about us or for us to have a phone call or facetime. My Husband only called her this past week to try and reach out and actually establish a relationship, which is when it was brought up (I was not there). We have not seen or spoken to her properly since the wedding (not due to lack of trying on our part). \n\nOma and Opa are my Husbands Grandparents (I am not sure what you call them when they are Great as I am English) and also MIL did write the words, Great Grandma, Great Grandad and Grandma in her message.

I mean, I wouldn\u2019t hold it over anyone\u2019s head, but it was rude on OP and her now spouse\u2019s part.", "Why is all of this going through you.
