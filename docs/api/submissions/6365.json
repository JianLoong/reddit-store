Jane has a daughter Luci (16f) and Luci's father was never in the picture. Jane married a dude and Luci called him dad but he abandoned her after six years. Even still, Luci was way more happy about their marriage than I was. For me it was tough to see my dad find someone else, because it was hard for me to wrap my brain around him wanting another wife when I didn't want another mom or mom figure. I never made a big deal out of it but this wasn't the happily ever after for me that it was for Luci, who really wanted another dad. My dad and Jane realized it was tough for me and put me in therapy, where I still go today. We also had family therapy a year into their marriage where we had to be open about our feelings. I was honest, to a point. I said it was hard for me to see it as a happy thing and that it would never be the same to me or what I truly want, but it was nice to see dad happy and Jane and Luci were fine.\n\nLuci latched onto everything I said, including when I brought up in therapy that I didn't want Jane to try and be my mom or for anyone to think I now had two mom's. She would bring up to me that she was glad she had another dad, how nice it is to have a whole family and stuff. She became insufferable when we were 12 and dad and Jane had a baby together. She'd say how we were all brought together by our half brother, and she told me how her mom had now given me two siblings and that should be enough for her to count as a mom now. I told Jane about it and she told me she'd talk to Luci but she never did. I talked to dad when it continued. He told me Luci didn't mean any harm and that I should take it as an honor that she feels the way she does because so many kids would be totally against sharing their parents like she's willing to. He told me if she ever gets dismissive of my mom's death, then it would deserve a talking to.\n\nTime passed, things got easier but it's still not the same for me as it is for Luci. Last week Luci started to say embracing my dad as her own was for the best and I should do the same with her mom. She said our experience leading to become a family were the same and she knew what she was talking about. I didn't like when she said that and I told her it wasn't the same because my mom died and I will never get to see or speak to her again. She insisted it was no different from her. I told her it was and we'd never understand how the other felt. She got upset with me and said it should be easier for me and that I can't hold onto my mom forever and I need to let go of her like she let go of her first dad because they're both gone and we're better for it. I got so mad and yelled at her to leave me the fuck alone. She burst into tears. My dad told me he would talk to Luci when I explained what happened but Jane was pissed and so was Luci and they said I had no right to yell at her the way I did.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672745348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1025qgk/aita_for_yelling_at_my_stepsister_and_making_her/", "score": 355, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lucy had two fathers walk out on her, so it's pretty easy to see why she clings to the idea of a family as hard as she does. You had your mother taken from you which is tragic and you have my sympathy, but I can see why Lucy thinks it would be easier to process. She was abandoned by two fathers and basically told she was not good enough, whereas your mom never chose to leave you. I think you should apologize for yelling at her, and tell your parents that you both need counseling together either family or just you two so you can come to some understanding of each other. It sucks that you've repeatedly had to say how you feel about your new family, but with the abandonment issues Lucy has, it's going to take work on all sides.", "NTA shes trying to make you replace your late mother with her mother and is completely disregarding your pain that you are still experiencing. a bit concerning your dad is completely fine with this. i would express this to him and if he doesnt do anything about it, wait till your 18 and go NC with the lot of them. they clearly dont care about the pain and trauma experienced as a child losing your mom. im sorry for your loss", "NTA. Luci is old enough to stop harping on this.  Great she\u2019s happy and loves your dad etc.  but 6 years of her badgering you to feel the same is way over the line.   I don\u2019t even need to get into the actual things she said, saying you\u2019re in the same situation.  Pretending you were\u2026and her father died when she was 7\u2026.Nothing excuses her attempts for six years to force you to feel the exact same about everything the way she does. Her mother Jane should absolutely be putting a stop to this and it shouldn\u2019t have come to the fact that you had to yell at her and who cares if you made her cry?", "YTA. I do not think she actually meant that you were better off having lost your mother or forgetting her but opening up to the new situation and to your step-mother and sister. \n\nHaving been abandoned by a father must be rough as well, even though not the same. She expressed her sentiments awkwardly but I fail to notice any malice in her actions. Rather she seems to want to bond with you. That is based on the text, I naturally may be wrong. Hence you might want to revisit your position and talk with your father about the issue.", "YTA and everyone saying you aren\u2019t likely hasn\u2019t had the same experience as you. \n\nLet me get this out of the way first, you aren\u2019t \u201cbetter off\u201d for having a dead parent. However you\u2019re not going to want to hear this, but your sister is right that you do need to move on. \n\nMy father died when I was 11, my mom has since remarried but that didn\u2019t cause me to be a standoffish prick to my new step siblings because I knew that what mattered was my mom\u2019s happiness. As overbearing as she may be, your sister is doing her literal best to bring you all together as a family, and you are actively inhibiting that by clinging to your grief and refusing to accept your new mother and sister. \n\nImagine if she had the same attitude as you, and made it clear she would never love or accept you or your father since her \u201creal dad\u201d was still out there somewhere. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to let go of your biological mother. There should always be a place in your heart for her. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t grow to love your new mother in a different way. You need to grow up and realize that your anger is making this harder on your father who is also grieving and doing his best to move on. \n\nAll of this is easier said than done but my advice would be to be honest in family therapy and actually commit to an improvement. The first step is wanting to make a change.", " NTA \nYou and Luci have different feelings about the situation and no one\u2019s feelings are more valid than the others. This is one of those situations where people agree to disagree but also disagree without being disagreeable.\n\nTell Luci that your feelings on the issue aren\u2019t up for discussion anymore. You don\u2019t owe her an apology just because she cried, that\u2019s on her. She needs to stop getting into this topic with you. Your feelings are exactly that \u201cthe way you feel\u201d. \n\nAlso inform your dad and SM that you won\u2019t be responding to Luci on the subject going forward. Whatever is said in therapy which is a safe space isn\u2019t up for further discussion in the house.", "Thank you. I never outright disliked her before she said that about being better off without my mom. Even if it's true that she's better off without the guys who abandoned her, to say it's the same when my mom died really made me look at her differently. I had to fight so hard to not say worse things. But I also know she's hurting a lot.", "I hope so too because otherwise the next two years will be miserable as fuck.", "...What? You sound like an abusive asshole. Was he meant to physically harm his stepsister?", "I do understand that which is why, even though angry, I just wanted her to get away from me.", "What kind of compromise?", "\"Being abandoned by a father\" means he didn\u2019t want her. Very easy to shut him out and look for a replacement.\n\n\"Mother died\" means mom loved me, wanted me, and was taken from me too early. I don\u2019t want to replace her. \n\nApples and oranges.", "I have to ask though. Why does he have to accept them as a mom and sister? He said he it was hard, but he got along with them and tried to be happy for his dad. His step sister\u2019s comments and badgering him to replace his dead mother with hers for YEARS, definitely pushed him away further, and the adults in his life refused to stop her. I can see why he was frustrated and snapped at her. I don\u2019t think not bonding super tight with them makes him a selfish prick.", "Seriously? Everyone has to behave like you have after losing a parent or they're the AH? OP's thoughts feelings and wishes are irrelevant, he should just accept a new mother?\n\nOP does not want another parent, but he accepted Jane and Luci into his life and got along with them, he just didn't see them as mother and sister. \n\nRather than respecting OP's boundaries, Luci has chosen over and over again to try and make OP feel the same way she does. That has only alienated her from OP, and has caused resentment. Jane has refused to stop this, likely because Luci is acting as her mouthpiece. \n\nIt isn't clinging to grief to not want to replace someone. Some people want an extra parent and are happy about it, others don't, just like some widows or widowers remarry and others don't. It is an individual choice, and it doesn't mean someone is miserable and wallowing in grief if they don't replace the person they've lost; people can live perfectly happy lives without having to constantly replace those that they've lost. \n\nStop trying to make OP feel guilty by saying he is making it difficult for his dad. His dad has moved on, he had remarried, has Luci and a new child, and seems to be doing just fine. This whole issue has been caused not by OP, but by Luci refusing to let it go. She said OP was better off without his mum. OP's mother wasn't like Luci's dad, she did not abandon OP, she died, and for Luci to act like OP is better off because of that is disgusting. \n\nLove doesn't develop when it's forced. If Jane had made Luci stop and if Luci had been taught that you cannot force people to change their feelings, this would not have happened. Instead, Luci has spent years pushing OP until he snapped. \n\nI get it, Luci wants a big happy family, and she likely could have had that if she stopped fixating on titles like sister and mum, stopped trying to badger OP into giving her and her mum the titles they demand, and had in fact worked on developing a friendship and relationship with OP. Luci is not trying to bring them together, she is trying to get her way, and her efforts to do so are what is tearing the family apart. \n\nYou don't force a blended family to happen, you carefully build it using understanding, kindness, and by respecting each others boundaries. Luci will not respect boundaries and she is refusing to understand anything except what she wants and feels. Jane is doing a similar thing.", ">>>>You need to grow up and realize that your anger is making this harder on your father who is also grieving and doing his best to move on.\n\nTHIS! Exactly.", "The thing is so are you. She needs to realise this too. She sounds very selfish. Like she's only seeing her hurt and how creating a bond with you will make her happy regardless of your feelings. \n\nMaybe one day you can see her as a sister, but pushing the issue on you now will never make that happen and saying the things she is, is certainly not going to get you to that stage. \n\nI commend you for holding back and only going as far as raising your voice. I'm not sure if the situation was on my end I'd have been the same in all honesty. You're a lot stronger than I am, which speaks very highly of your character and how much of an influence your mom had on you when she was around. \n\nTake that with you always and know she will always be with you in some way, shape or form, everyone else be damned.", "You could always choose not to engage with Luci if she keeps on at you. I know it's hard when someone is being deliberately hurtful but repeating \"Luci, I am not interested in talking about this\" and walking away (if you can) and not responding to her is a way to deal with her and if your Dad and Jane are around and get pissy you can repeat \"Dad/Jane, Luci is being hurtful and I am not interested in talking about this\".\n\nDon't let her rile you up, if you stay calm and don't get combative then no one can lay the blame on you. It's tough, I know, but staying calm and reasonable will hopefully get her to quit.", "the way you jumped to conclusions lmfao\u2026", "Would you care to elaborate on on that?\n\nAll I'm saying is if someone has repeatedly crossed my boundary by trying to impose a relationship with them and force a relationship with their mother, even after being told multiple times that I am not interested, then they had the nerve to say that i am better of being a dead parent, I would have lost my temper. I would not result to physical harm, but I would have said a lot more than fuck off. \n\nI am not saying OP should have physically attacked her, I'm saying he is well restrained with only having that reaction after dealing with the step-sisters bullshit for 6 years.\n\nIt was easy for the Step-Sister to claim OP's father as her new dad because her bio dad left her, she never knew him. OP's mom died. He has memories of her and he does not want a replacement. He wants people to respect how he feels and his step-sister has repeatedly disrespected him and crossed so many boundaries, and the parents are not exactly helping with the situation either. \n\nEven if OP had resulted in physical harm, could you really have blamed him after 6 years of emotional abuse from the step-sister", "It's not like that, I think he meant that he could have been worse by telling her some times the stepsister need to ear. I guess", "As someone whose father left after a very bitter divorce I can get what your stepsister feels: abandonment and betrayal. She sticks to every opportunity to make 'now there's a full normal socially accepted family!' thing come true\n\nAnd yes, girls from 'not full socially accepted families' are usually judged quite harshly in our society. Don't exactly get why but we do, learned from personal experience. She might have an inner fear related to the issue.\n\nYou are still NTA but try to be a bit more emphatic. And yes, you BOTH need another therapist cause I see no progress neither in your nor in her case.", "I would say the compromise is for her to not mention how you are alike( when clearly you arent ) and for jane to have more control over what her daughter is saying/ doing and more discipline set for those wrong doings as well. \n\n\nSay you need to set some boundaries, one being unless you have something nice to say, my mother should NEVER be brought up.\n\nAnd two luci needs to seek therapy, she was abandoned and  needs to sort that out and stop projecting it onto other people in her life. \n\n\n\nIm sorry but your dad is the one who needs to make sure these are taken seriously.", "NTA.

These bonds grow over time with compassion, patience, understanding.

My stepbrother would *NEVER* think of saying what Luci has said to you. He isn\u2019t particularly emotionally intelligent (but what 25 year old guy is?) and he knew to never compare our situations.

Yeahhh that's absurd, like the part where you said \"that doesn't mean you can't grow to love your new mother in a different way\" couldn't possibly have that \"different way\" be a civil and respectful relationship where OP doesn't necessarily need to consider the stepmother a mother figure.\n\nThe stepsister isn't doing her best, any more than a so-called  Nice Guy wailing at the object of his affections should loooooove him is \"doing his best\".

She's decided that she can fix her insecurities by forcing OP to feel the same way she does. There are consequences for those actions, like the negative light OP now sees her in. It might not be her fault she is hurting, but it is her - and her mother's - responsibility to get her treatment instead of letting her hurt others with her words and actions. \n\nIt's very difficult for me to empathize with her thinking OP is better off without his deceased mother just because she's better off in her new family. If someone is hurting it is always their responsibility not to spread that hurt onto others. Luci is not meeting that responsibility, and her own mother is failing to help her do so.

Besides, the changes I\u2019m suggesting you make are far more nuanced and don\u2019t require calling Jane mom. \n\nI just highly doubt it is the case that the ONLY thing going on here is that you won\u2019t literally call Jane \u201cmom\u201d. Acknowledging Jane as your mother is 99% respecting her and her daughter as members of your family. Showing them decency, not giving them a hard time for being in your space, making an effort to bond with them and your new sisters, etc. \n\nYour comments and initial post make clear that you\u2019re treating them like acquaintances who happen to live with you. Shutting them out and refusing any attempt at emotional connection while dismissing their efforts as insufferable and stupid.\n\nIt isn\u2019t selfish to not want to *rush* intimacy, but it is selfish to deny attempts at eventually creating intimacy.\n\nYour question has been answered, you\u2019re not an asshole for reacting negatively to the things your sister said to you. They were hurtful and frankly totally uncalled for. But I\u2019m giving you advice that these myopic Redditors won\u2019t. You are not the only person in your family. You can stop the brooding teen routine eventually and let them in. If you don\u2019t you\u2019ll cause your family a lot of emotional trouble. That\u2019s fine, you\u2019re pretty much an adult at this point, and it\u2019s your right to choose who to accept into your life and when, it just smacks of emotional immaturity.", "I think what matters is the term \u201cget along\u201d. I think a lot of responses are assuming OP is totally cooperative with his new mom and sister and just isn\u2019t ready to call her \u201cmom\u201d yet and adopt that level of intimacy. If that\u2019s the case then fair enough, I\u2019ll take back by the TYA. Honestly without seeing their interactions it\u2019s impossible to really say. \n\nHowever I doubt this is the case. OP\u2019s post reads as a rejection of Jane and Luci entirely, not simply a refusal to adopt a heightened level of intimacy. Calling his own sister insufferable and showing no affection for his little sister. \n\nOP should try and grow closer with the person his father has chosen to make a new life with for his father\u2019s sake, their sake, and ultimately OP\u2019s sake. Having more people in your life to love and support you is unequivocally a good thing. And at base it\u2019s immature to be a negative emotional element in what would otherwise be a loving home. \n\nSure Luci is pushing but \u201cbadgering\u201d is unfair.

She is looking at your experiences from her own perspective, she wasn\u2019t attacking you. Neither of you have enough life experience to understand what either of you are going through.

You experienced a very traumatic, painful loss. You both have trauma that needs to be dealt with. She\u2019s choosing to embrace her new life. You\u2019re choosing to not to embrace it.\n\nHowever, the issue is you yelling. That\u2019s not an appropriate response. You should speak to your therapist about how to form a better response in the future when you\u2019re angry. Learn from this experience with Luci.

What she said was incredibly cruel and tone deaf. To tell someone that their mom's death was a good thing is not just naive. That would be like me saying I'm glad she had been abandoned twice. But I would never say that. Ever. And I held back from saying a lot of things to her in the moment.

I interpret Luci\u2019s statements as meaning you both have a new chance to find happiness. Her statements were immature. She is 16. \n\nYou said you were not exactly 100% truthful in family therapy.

There are just times where, to spare people's feelings and to not be totally cruel, you need to be careful how you say things.", "I understand the truth can sometimes hurt but you & Luci are dealing with some very complex emotions & issues. I think if you truly want to try to help yourself you are going to need to be honest with the adults in your life.\n\nAfter reading your responses I realized no one sucks here. I apologize for that judgment. You are both kids who have experienced more trauma than anyone should have to go through at such a young age. I truly hope you ask for help & try to help yourself to find a way to move forward without all the baggage of anger & hurt you\u2019re carrying. It hurts my heart to hear that you are not feeling like you are not getting enough love or understanding from your family. I believe your Dad & Jane would like to know that."]}
