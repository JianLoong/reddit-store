Jane has a daughter Luci (16f) and Luci's father was never in the picture. Jane married a dude and Luci called him dad but he abandoned her after six years. Even still, Luci was way more happy about their marriage than I was. For me it was tough to see my dad find someone else, because it was hard for me to wrap my brain around him wanting another wife when I didn't want another mom or mom figure. I never made a big deal out of it but this wasn't the happily ever after for me that it was for Luci, who really wanted another dad. My dad and Jane realized it was tough for me and put me in therapy, where I still go today. We also had family therapy a year into their marriage where we had to be open about our feelings. I was honest, to a point. I said it was hard for me to see it as a happy thing and that it would never be the same to me or what I truly want, but it was nice to see dad happy and Jane and Luci were fine.\n\nLuci latched onto everything I said, including when I brought up in therapy that I didn't want Jane to try and be my mom or for anyone to think I now had two mom's. She would bring up to me that she was glad she had another dad, how nice it is to have a whole family and stuff. She became insufferable when we were 12 and dad and Jane had a baby together. She'd say how we were all brought together by our half brother, and she told me how her mom had now given me two siblings and that should be enough for her to count as a mom now. I told Jane about it and she told me she'd talk to Luci but she never did. I talked to dad when it continued. He told me Luci didn't mean any harm and that I should take it as an honor that she feels the way she does because so many kids would be totally against sharing their parents like she's willing to. He told me if she ever gets dismissive of my mom's death, then it would deserve a talking to.\n\nTime passed, things got easier but it's still not the same for me as it is for Luci. Last week Luci started to say embracing my dad as her own was for the best and I should do the same with her mom. She said our experience leading to become a family were the same and she knew what she was talking about. I didn't like when she said that and I told her it wasn't the same because my mom died and I will never get to see or speak to her again. She insisted it was no different from her. I told her it was and we'd never understand how the other felt. She got upset with me and said it should be easier for me and that I can't hold onto my mom forever and I need to let go of her like she let go of her first dad because they're both gone and we're better for it. I got so mad and yelled at her to leave me the fuck alone. She burst into tears. My dad told me he would talk to Luci when I explained what happened but Jane was pissed and so was Luci and they said I had no right to yell at her the way I did.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672745348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1025qgk/aita_for_yelling_at_my_stepsister_and_making_her/", "score": 1925, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lucy had two fathers walk out on her, so it's pretty easy to see why she clings to the idea of a family as hard as she does. You had your mother taken from you which is tragic and you have my sympathy, but I can see why Lucy thinks it would be easier to process. She was abandoned by two fathers and basically told she was not good enough, whereas your mom never chose to leave you. I think you should apologize for yelling at her, and tell your parents that you both need counseling together either family or just you two so you can come to some understanding of each other. It sucks that you've repeatedly had to say how you feel about your new family, but with the abandonment issues Lucy has, it's going to take work on all sides.", "NTA shes trying to make you replace your late mother with her mother and is completely disregarding your pain that you are still experiencing. a bit concerning your dad is completely fine with this. i would express this to him and if he doesnt do anything about it, wait till your 18 and go NC with the lot of them. they clearly dont care about the pain and trauma experienced as a child losing your mom. im sorry for your loss", "NTA. Luci is old enough to stop harping on this.  Great she\u2019s happy and loves your dad etc.  but 6 years of her badgering you to feel the same is way over the line.   I don\u2019t even need to get into the actual things she said, saying you\u2019re in the same situation.  Pretending you were\u2026and her father died when she was 7\u2026.Nothing excuses her attempts for six years to force you to feel the exact same about everything the way she does. Her mother Jane should absolutely be putting a stop to this and it shouldn\u2019t have come to the fact that you had to yell at her and who cares if you made her cry?", "YTA. I do not think she actually meant that you were better off having lost your mother or forgetting her but opening up to the new situation and to your step-mother and sister. \n\nHaving been abandoned by a father must be rough as well, even though not the same. She expressed her sentiments awkwardly but I fail to notice any malice in her actions. Rather she seems to want to bond with you. That is based on the text, I naturally may be wrong. Hence you might want to revisit your position and talk with your father about the issue.", "YTA and everyone saying you aren\u2019t likely hasn\u2019t had the same experience as you. \n\nLet me get this out of the way first, you aren\u2019t \u201cbetter off\u201d for having a dead parent. However you\u2019re not going to want to hear this, but your sister is right that you do need to move on. \n\nMy father died when I was 11, my mom has since remarried but that didn\u2019t cause me to be a standoffish prick to my new step siblings because I knew that what mattered was my mom\u2019s happiness. As overbearing as she may be, your sister is doing her literal best to bring you all together as a family, and you are actively inhibiting that by clinging to your grief and refusing to accept your new mother and sister. \n\nImagine if she had the same attitude as you, and made it clear she would never love or accept you or your father since her \u201creal dad\u201d was still out there somewhere. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to let go of your biological mother. There should always be a place in your heart for her. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t grow to love your new mother in a different way. You need to grow up and realize that your anger is making this harder on your father who is also grieving and doing his best to move on. \n\nAll of this is easier said than done but my advice would be to be honest in family therapy and actually commit to an improvement. The first step is wanting to make a change.", " NTA \nYou and Luci have different feelings about the situation and no one\u2019s feelings are more valid than the others. This is one of those situations where people agree to disagree but also disagree without being disagreeable.\n\nTell Luci that your feelings on the issue aren\u2019t up for discussion anymore. You don\u2019t owe her an apology just because she cried, that\u2019s on her. She needs to stop getting into this topic with you. Your feelings are exactly that \u201cthe way you feel\u201d. \n\nAlso inform your dad and SM that you won\u2019t be responding to Luci on the subject going forward. Whatever is said in therapy which is a safe space isn\u2019t up for further discussion in the house.", "Thank you. I never outright disliked her before she said that about being better off without my mom. Even if it's true that she's better off without the guys who abandoned her, to say it's the same when my mom died really made me look at her differently. I had to fight so hard to not say worse things. But I also know she's hurting a lot.", "I hope so too because otherwise the next two years will be miserable as fuck.", "...What? You sound like an abusive asshole. Was he meant to physically harm his stepsister?", "I do understand that which is why, even though angry, I just wanted her to get away from me.", "What kind of compromise?", "\"Being abandoned by a father\" means he didn\u2019t want her. Very easy to shut him out and look for a replacement.\n\n\"Mother died\" means mom loved me, wanted me, and was taken from me too early. I don\u2019t want to replace her. \n\nApples and oranges.", "I have to ask though. Why does he have to accept them as a mom and sister? He said he it was hard, but he got along with them and tried to be happy for his dad. His step sister\u2019s comments and badgering him to replace his dead mother with hers for YEARS, definitely pushed him away further, and the adults in his life refused to stop her. I can see why he was frustrated and snapped at her. I don\u2019t think not bonding super tight with them makes him a selfish prick.", "Seriously? Everyone has to behave like you have after losing a parent or they're the AH? OP's thoughts feelings and wishes are irrelevant, he should just accept a new mother?\n\nOP does not want another parent, but he accepted Jane and Luci into his life and got along with them, he just didn't see them as mother and sister. \n\nRather than respecting OP's boundaries, Luci has chosen over and over again to try and make OP feel the same way she does. That has only alienated her from OP, and has caused resentment. Jane has refused to stop this, likely because Luci is acting as her mouthpiece. \n\nIt isn't clinging to grief to not want to replace someone. Some people want an extra parent and are happy about it, others don't, just like some widows or widowers remarry and others don't. It is an individual choice, and it doesn't mean someone is miserable and wallowing in grief if they don't replace the person they've lost; people can live perfectly happy lives without having to constantly replace those that they've lost. \n\nStop trying to make OP feel guilty by saying he is making it difficult for his dad. His dad has moved on, he had remarried, has Luci and a new child, and seems to be doing just fine. This whole issue has been caused not by OP, but by Luci refusing to let it go. She said OP was better off without his mum. OP's mother wasn't like Luci's dad, she did not abandon OP, she died, and for Luci to act like OP is better off because of that is disgusting. \n\nLove doesn't develop when it's forced. If Jane had made Luci stop and if Luci had been taught that you cannot force people to change their feelings, this would not have happened. Instead, Luci has spent years pushing OP until he snapped. \n\nI get it, Luci wants a big happy family, and she likely could have had that if she stopped fixating on titles like sister and mum, stopped trying to badger OP into giving her and her mum the titles they demand, and had in fact worked on developing a friendship and relationship with OP. Luci is not trying to bring them together, she is trying to get her way, and her efforts to do so are what is tearing the family apart. \n\nYou don't force a blended family to happen, you carefully build it using understanding, kindness, and by respecting each others boundaries. Luci will not respect boundaries and she is refusing to understand anything except what she wants and feels. Jane is doing a similar thing.", ">>>>You need to grow up and realize that your anger is making this harder on your father who is also grieving and doing his best to move on.\n\nTHIS! Exactly.", "The thing is so are you. She needs to realise this too. She sounds very selfish. Like she's only seeing her hurt and how creating a bond with you will make her happy regardless of your feelings. \n\nMaybe one day you can see her as a sister, but pushing the issue on you now will never make that happen and saying the things she is, is certainly not going to get you to that stage. \n\nI commend you for holding back and only going as far as raising your voice. I'm not sure if the situation was on my end I'd have been the same in all honesty. You're a lot stronger than I am, which speaks very highly of your character and how much of an influence your mom had on you when she was around. \n\nTake that with you always and know she will always be with you in some way, shape or form, everyone else be damned.", "You could always choose not to engage with Luci if she keeps on at you. I know it's hard when someone is being deliberately hurtful but repeating \"Luci, I am not interested in talking about this\" and walking away (if you can) and not responding to her is a way to deal with her and if your Dad and Jane are around and get pissy you can repeat \"Dad/Jane, Luci is being hurtful and I am not interested in talking about this\".\n\nDon't let her rile you up, if you stay calm and don't get combative then no one can lay the blame on you. It's tough, I know, but staying calm and reasonable will hopefully get her to quit.", "the way you jumped to conclusions lmfao\u2026", "Would you care to elaborate on on that?\n\nAll I'm saying is if someone has repeatedly crossed my boundary by trying to impose a relationship with them and force a relationship with their mother, even after being told multiple times that I am not interested, then they had the nerve to say that i am better of being a dead parent, I would have lost my temper. I would not result to physical harm, but I would have said a lot more than fuck off. \n\nI am not saying OP should have physically attacked her, I'm saying he is well restrained with only having that reaction after dealing with the step-sisters bullshit for 6 years.\n\nIt was easy for the Step-Sister to claim OP's father as her new dad because her bio dad left her, she never knew him. OP's mom died. He has memories of her and he does not want a replacement. He wants people to respect how he feels and his step-sister has repeatedly disrespected him and crossed so many boundaries, and the parents are not exactly helping with the situation either. \n\nEven if OP had resulted in physical harm, could you really have blamed him after 6 years of emotional abuse from the step-sister", "It's not like that, I think he meant that he could have been worse by telling her some times the stepsister need to ear. I guess", "As someone whose father left after a very bitter divorce I can get what your stepsister feels: abandonment and betrayal. She sticks to every opportunity to make 'now there's a full normal socially accepted family!' thing come true\n\nAnd yes, girls from 'not full socially accepted families' are usually judged quite harshly in our society. Don't exactly get why but we do, learned from personal experience. She might have an inner fear related to the issue.\n\nYou are still NTA but try to be a bit more emphatic. And yes, you BOTH need another therapist cause I see no progress neither in your nor in her case.", "I would say the compromise is for her to not mention how you are alike( when clearly you arent ) and for jane to have more control over what her daughter is saying/ doing and more discipline set for those wrong doings as well. \n\n\nSay you need to set some boundaries, one being unless you have something nice to say, my mother should NEVER be brought up.\n\nAnd two luci needs to seek therapy, she was abandoned and  needs to sort that out and stop projecting it onto other people in her life. \n\n\n\nIm sorry but your dad is the one who needs to make sure these are taken seriously.", "NTA.

It\u2019s just allowing her to over step boundaries now. You\u2019re probably not going to get your father to have a talk with her about backing off, even though he promised, for that very reason. He wants you to move on from your mother to embrace his current family. \n\nLuci completely is out of line. She overstepped her boundaries repeatedly and she also keeps invalidating your feelings because they don\u2019t align with hers. She pushed you to the point of breaking and the has a temper tantrum and makes herself the victim. That\u2019s manipulative, narcissistic behavior. Her pushing you the way she is is emotional abuse.

Your mother died, and your memories will always be tender toward her. Her sperm donor was trashy and abandoned her. Surely she wouldn't feel the same toward him as you do towards your mother. I don't think she's entirely the a-hole because she is still young and doesn't fully grasp the difference in your experiences. She wants a relationship with you that not all stepsisters would want, especially at your age. She wants you to love her mother and to feel like a family because she never had one. It's not okay for her to push that on you, but I think her intentions are well-meaning. NAH\n\nEdited to add: Lucy saying you're better off without your mother is an a****** move, but I think it was unintentional and came from a place of her hurting over the fact that her sperm donor doesn't love her and abandoned her and she doesn't realize your experience is different.

Unless I missed something, it sounds like Luci is trying to be well intentioned, and has some good points, although it also seems like she also doesn't understand you might still be in a different place than her concerning your emotions and your grief.

If you were to say something to her like \"I'm glad that you're happy with this situation, and I know you're just trying to help me, but I'm not where you're at yet, and I would appreciate some personal space to work through things at my own pace. For now, I'd rather work only with my therapist on these issues.\" ... do you think she would listen and give you the space you need?", "To be honest Luci seems like an extremely nice and simultaneously very vulnerable girl. I think her being abandoned her ultimate dream has become having a stable loving family.

You are the sister that swooped in and would love her and never leave. To her your mother dying meant you could be there for her, to love her and never leave her. What she said was evil, but I don't think she is evil she is just very clouded by her own needs, it seems she needs you very much and maybe you should talk about your perspectives to each other. So she can learn to understand your perspective better.  \n\n\nI don't know what to feel/or what to do in your situation. From my limited knowledge from glancing at the situation through your story I would say: don't be to hard on the kid. Maybe growing to love her as a sister would not be out of the question. My best friend feels like a brother. If you really like your \"step sister\" in general it's possible you guys could feel like sisters in the future. That would not be a betrayal to the memory of your mother in the slightest. I do not think anyone is truly an asshole in this situation.\n\nYou take care. I lost my father a couple of years ago at age 33; it was so hard on me. Losing your mother at that age.... I emphatize a lot. I wish you all the very best.", "I don't think anyone is an AH here. It's a hard road to travel, and I think Luci is, in an immature way, trying to make it easier. She doesn't know she is saying the wrong things, because she doesn't have the life experiences to know even what she's saying. I wish (and I'm sure you do too) that she would quit bugging you about it, but I hope you both can mature into a friendly relationship.", "NTA\n\nI can't believe that she said you are better off with your mother dead.\n\nWith that being said, perhaps you should go easy on her. A lot of people, when it comes to grief, try to only look at at positives and ignore the negatives because they can't deal with them. That's what she is doing. She can't deal with the fact that her first two fathers abandoned her and so she is pretending that everything turned out for the better. If she was really honest, she'd probably say that she'd rather her real father loved her enough to not abandon her.\n\nThe problem is, you don't share this view, and it is threatening the little reality she has created for herself. She wants to believe in this white lie, and you're ruining it by pointing out all of the logical flaws.\n\nNone of which is to say that you're wrong, but it is to give you perspective on why she is acting the way she is. And to ask you to go a little easier on her, because she's grieving too, although she displays it differently to you.\n\nThere is one general theme that she is right about, and that is, \"be happy with what you've got\". I'm sorry you lost your Mom at such a young age and nothing can ever undo that, or make it good. But you've got something a lot of people would kill for - a stable home with two parents who love each other. You should learn to value this, because the alternative is remaining bitter for the rest of your life, and that's no fun.

He said he would talk to Luci if she started to disrespect OPs moms death, but ignored that Lucis continued push for OP to accept her mom as his own is just that.

She plainly has issues and that\u2019s understandable, I don\u2019t knock her for that.  But she needs therapy.

People that have been abandoned by parents still carry with them the weight of absence; everything in society will remind you you were abandoned, that you are no whole, that you are missing a parent.

Additionally, stepsister compares OP's beloved deceased mother who did not leave of her own will to two terrible fathers who did leave of their own will and quite frankly, I would've reacted the same as OP if I were in their shoes. It casts the deceased mother in a terrible light and disrespects her death and the feelings OP still has about it.

Daddy-issues don\u2019t make someone an asshole or unable to recognize their step-brother feels different due to his different situation.", "Op is alson 16, why only Luci gets an pass for being  young and will learn later?", "is it?? imagine you lost your mother- keep in mind he wasnt a baby when he lost her, he was 7 he had time to build a connection AND was in (since hes 16) most of his life and then hearing youre getting a step mom. he handled it pretty well, he didnt tell his dad not too and \"accepted\" the marrige what hes NOT tolerating is calling her mom which he has the right not to do, shes NOT his mom but her and her kid keep forcing it down his throat THEN the kid has the balls to say his life was better after his mother died, refer back to what i just said. in NO WAY is his dad dying the same as her dad leaving. its not projecting or him being selfish its him being human not wanting some woman be called his mom", "Not much of a stretch since they are already poor parents for letting things get to this point with Luci bullying OP.", "I think Luci is desperately trying to avoid being seen (or seeing herself) as less than the OP. \n\nIn fact, that\u2019s what\u2019s bothering me about the OP\u2019s descriptions. He seems to think of Luci and her mom as beneath him. That\u2019s where the true friction lies, imho.", "I didn't say OPs therapy isn't working. But the parents should have put BOTH girls in therapy, not together but just to process their trauma.  She's 16, she's felt this way for 10 years. It should have been addressed 6 years ago. OP is NTA but the parents are.", "i\u2019m not speaking on the sister issues.\n\nMy dad died when I was 16 and I deeply regret the issues it caused my mother trying to date when I thought she was trying to replace my dad but in reality she just wanted another lover.\n\nbeing silent about something is not accepting it. he was sent to therapy because he obviously was reacting to it.\n\nalso having a hard time seeing where anyone but sister is \u201cforcing\u201d him to act like she is mom. It\u2019s a dense read so maybe I missed it.", "Sounds like you\u2019ve been respectful and accepting of them. They are Step Family and they need to get it into their heads that there\u2019s nothing wrong with that and to stop trying to alter reality. I have step parents and step siblings, I love them but it\u2019s not the same as the love I have for my bio parents and bio siblings and that\u2019s ok, the relationship is different. I\u2019ll never understand why some people feel the need to force things. I can honestly say I have friends I love more than my step family, that doesn\u2019t mean my step family doesn\u2019t matter or that I dislike them.", "to the end bit, the step mother by enabling her daughter. the son has asked mutilple times to stop but the mother never does anything and keep enabling her to continue", "you didnt accept it either at first apparently so you should know he shouldnt forced to accept her, yeah it causes problems but the dad wasnt the only one who lost someone, like how your mom wasnt the only one who lost someone, his son is still grieving. people grieve differently. what the dad does and how he grieved/moved on shouldnt be forced onto a kid. not to point fingers or be a bitch but you should understand that. your mom might not have been trying to replace your dad but this is different. the dad might not have but the step mom and the kid clearly are and are being very open about it.", "I\u2019m worried that you work in mental health"]}
