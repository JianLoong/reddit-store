They lost their mom, and their dad moved on kind of quickly, so it's hard to blame them.\n\nThe only person that comes off as a bit of an asshole here is Declan. Sounds like he really didn't put in the necessary time and work with his kids before getting married to Emily.\n\nFamilies are tough sometimes. I hope it works out for them.", "NTA- sounds like they we all in denial and now she needs someone to blame. \n\nIf you noticed something during the few times you spent with the family unit, why didn\u2019t she notice when she was with them a lot more? Because she didn\u2019t want to.", "NTA\n\nI understand your position fully, dammed if you do dammed if you don't.\n\nI understand the kids position as well.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how your BIL and his Your Sister missed it. The kids are unhappy and there is a reason. The kids see it as a betrayal of their Mum who they are still grieving for. It is only 5 years since she passed and he was hooked up again in 2. Their reaction is normal. and then to add a new born in to the mix!!!!\n\nYour Sister is in for a very hard time, those kids are going to drive a wedge between them.", "The clues were there, Emily and her husband simply chose not to see them. It\u2019s rather sad that a third party could see that they were unhappy with the situation, but their father buried his head in the sand. She didn\u2019t ask you what your take on the children was, so giving her a heads up was not mandatory, so you\u2019re NTA. If it were my sister though, I would have said something.", "NTA. She's upset and hurt, and a bit over sensitive due to what she's going through. Any human likely would be. It wasn't your place to share.", "NTA, I don\u2019t think she would have listened anyway & it would have strained your relationship.", "NTA. I agree that it wasn\u2019t your place. Honestly, Declan is an AH for bringing a new woman into his life without being 100% clear that his kids were in board.", "NTA.  If they were both too involved in themselves to not notice the kids, I bet a virtual beverage OP's observations would not been well received.  I very much feel where these kids are coming from. Some of it is completely natural and unavoidable, but a larger part is Declan and Emily messed up big time in being blind to their needs.", "NTA. It wasn't your place to intervene in Emily's relationship, especially when she seemed happy. She needed to learn about the situation in her own time.", "ESH except the kids. \n\nDeclan is the biggest ah. He breezed forward after his wife's death, didn't bother to give his children enough time to heal, didn't bother to open his eyes and notice anything about his kids. \n\nYour sister- milder ah. If I were her I'd be more concerned about dating someone who jas children whose wife (and children's mother) passed away just 1 year ago. It should be obvious to anyone with any common sense that 1 year is not enough for children to heal from the loss of a parent and that they would totally feel like their father was just rushing to replace their mother. \n\nYou- also a milder ah. This is your sister. And you sound quite close. I have a sister too and I would've absolutely said something. Gently and compassionately, yes but I definitely would've said something. Yes there is a risk she might be annoyed with you at the time but these are risks we take sometimes to warn our closest loved ones of pitfalls they might fall into.", "NAH\n\nYou're not in the wrong for not inserting yourself into your sisters relationship uninvited, obviously... but I dont really think she's an AH for feeling a bit defensive and insecure. \n\nShe will be feeling like she missed signs, which she may have done, and probably needs time to see you're not in the wrong for not saying anything when she *didn't ask*. She'll be feeling pretty insecure and hurt, I feel for her, and so so much for the kids. I've been a part of a family like this, they may well come around yet, but I hope they give the kids space and permission to feel the way they do.\n\nI hope she has some support or considers therapy, blended + grieving family dynamics are tough and personally I don't think they're to be navigated alone - especially for the kids' sake.", "NAH. This was a no win situation. Because had you read the situation wrong then you could have potentially got the backlash for \"trying to start drama where there wasn't any\".\n\nReally the husband is the one responsible for how this played out. It seems the kids didn't have the necessary time to properly grieve their mother before he moved on. I mean how long was she dead before he started dating your sister?\n\nI'm sure the 11 and 10 year old really struggle because they were on the younger side, so their memories of their mom could be very limited. \n\nI hope in the future the situation works out the best way it can for everyone.", "NTA. This is one of those moments of \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\". If you'd have expressed your observations prior to her getting married you would probably have been told you were being unsupportive, or that you secretly didn't like Declan, or that you didn't want her to be happy, or any other number of negative things. Now that you've told told her you'd noticed it years ago, you're being told you're a crappy sister. For what it's worth, I would have probably gone about this the same way as you because however you played it you would have been wrong in your sisters eyes.", "NTA - she needs someone to blame, and she's focussing on you.", "YTA. You should have told her, if only for the sake of the children who had her imposed on them against their wishes. \n\nHowever, she chose to ignore their obvious discontent because she wanted her husband. \n\nMy only sympathy is for the children who had no say in this. There really should be laws protecting children from parents who force unwanted people into their homes. It's very unfair and emotionally abusive to do that to children.", "NAH\n\nI do think this was somewhat no-win, as too many times people will find a way to blame you for knowing regardless of telling them early on or too late. You felt it was better to stay out of her business, and that isn't an AH thing, nor would I consider your sister the AH for feeling upset about how her stepkids view and treat her. She's maybe a little blind to it, and is taking out the frustration on you which isn't ok, but I am confident she would react this way to you either way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And you couldn't have done anything to change her mind. She knew going in the kids mom was deceased, right? Declan and Emily both should have known better. Both of them should have put the kids needs first, and that doesn't seem to have happened here.   \nI never considered my stepmother family. She was just the woman that my father married after my mom left. I hated stepmom, and forty years later, I still hate her.   \nYou did not betray anything. What was betrayed was the kids memories of their mother after she left and never came back while this new woman is seemingly trying to take her place.", "Nta. Your sister and Declan are idiots.

And introducing her to his children?!", "NAH. You are right. It was not your place to tell her and, honestly, i think she would had devalue, thinking she would win them over.\n\nHer reaction is normal, she think she fail as a stepmother and that, if she kwen back than, she could have made something different. \n\nThe kids reaction is tottally normal. They are griving kids who saw (in their mind) her mother being replaced way too soon. \n\nThe father is the one whos giving me some doubts. For one hand, he was griving too and re\u2010starting a new life, but i dont get how he didnt see it before. If OP saw it, how didnt he? Didnt he talk with his kids about this new person in their lives?\n\nAnyway, OP is NTA", "Since the situation involves just you and your sister, NAH.\n\nYou did the right thing, imo. I can imagine her hurt and pain, and she was using you as a proxy to lash out at, which isn't cool. If she carries on making you the root cause of her problem, then N T A.

But the fact that neither your sister nor the children\u2019s father cared enough about the children to notice their discontent clearly show Why the kids are discontent in the first place.", "NAH.\n\nShould you have said something? Probably. Would Emily have paid attention? Maybe not.  If I was in your situation I'd have danced around the subject *very carefully* because I've seen what happens in this situation, and it's often not pretty.", "Nta.  Never marry someone with kids.  Seems like a life of misery based on all the horror stories on this sub.", "I have mixed thoughts on this. I feel like Emily could have been naive and explained away some more obvious things as being in her head or not the way she saw it initially. On the other hand I could see it as her putting it down to their personalities and them being introverted. The kids are pretty quiet anyway and she might have brushed away anything she noticed that seemed off as just that, they're introverts. It could be something else. It is possible she didn't want it to be true.", "> Sister is in for a very hard time, those kids are going to drive a wedge between them\n\nYep. Poor sister and poor her daughter...", "I totally understand why. It was something I debated myself over so much back when they were getting engaged. Ultimately, I chose to say nothing and I do sort of regret that now. But at the time it did feel like I was doing the right thing.", "This took some thinking but I think I agree with you. No adult gets clean report. They should not have gotten married so fast and you should have thought about kids instead of your sister. Telling would have damaged your relationship with your sister but would have helped the kids", "She does appear to be reflecting on the last few years and trying to figure out if there was anything she missed. I hope they do get more professional support. Even if they can't get anywhere doing something like family therapy, I speak from experience that individual therapy can be so helpful when you are going through something.", "Declan started dating my sister a year after his wife died. I believe he had gone on a couple of dates with others prior to meeting my sister as well.", "I would hope she would. I would like to think I would understand her not doing it too. But I also realize I let my worries about the negative ramifications if she didn't like what I was telling her stop me.", "Wow...if anyone is an AH here ita Declan who seems to be utterly clueless about his own children and who moved on without giving them proper time to grieve. The kids are not AHs by any means. Their father started dating someone new just 1 year after their mother passed away. How do you think they feel? Considering the fact that the maximum they've been is chilly and distant, I think they're way better behaved than average kids. Most kids in such a situation would be absolutely disruptive, and understandably so.", "I'm struggling to see how the kids are \"spoiled brats\". Their feelings are valid, they obviously felt like their mom was being replaced while they were still grieving and at their age expecting an adult level of emotional response is pretty unreasonable. If you think that shutting them out at this point is going to help then you're living in cloud cuckoo land, that's only going to make things worse.", "Oh yes I see that now! I apologize I misread that initially, I thought he didn't introduce the kids to her until a year after the wife died. I thought he started dating your sister much sooner.", "Fair enough. \n\nThat being said, sometimes it\u2019s the ones closest to us that tell us what we need to hear (whether we like it or not)\u2026 not what we want to hear; because it\u2019s for our own good and they love us.\n\nJust a little tidbit to keep in mind should a situation occur again where you conflicted regarding withholding concerns (or information). \n\nGood luck to both of you and I truly hope you two can work it out!", "I didn't said op is TA. I said that since the kids don't see her sister as family, then i would respect their wish and not treat them like family and would treat them, to use your words, chilly and distant. Dad can cook for them, wash their clothes, deal with the school and if they have some grandparents willing to take them in often, then even better. Doesn't reddit aita says stepmother shouldn't force their stepkids to create a raport?? I mean, reddit aita isn't really the place for that, because they hate stepmothers no matter what they do, but still. Why on earth do women chose to marry guys with kids they have full custody of is beyond me. I get they love the guy, but jesus christ  it must be so hard to deal with a stepkid who doesn't respect you...", ">If you think that shutting them out at this point is going to help\n\nDoesn't reddit says that a stepparent can't force a relationship if the kids are unwilling?? Make up your minds. If he kids are against it, the stepmom shouldn't force them and it's bad to try to have relationship. If stepmom doesn't try, \"she is the adult\" and she should try. Make up your minds", "You're fine. I should have explained more clearly in the post. They started dating a year after his wife died and married a year after they started dating.", "I'm referring to the comments you made about the kids. Calling them spoilt brats and saying they should be shipped off to a grandparents. These are kids who never properly got a chance to GRIEVE their mother's death. Yes there are step kids who do behave like brats but this is NOT an instance like that.", "Ok, couple of things here...First off, I'm not reddit. I'm one guy offering an opinion and I've never stated the things you say, you're putting words in my mouth at that point by making a massive generalisation. Secondly, there's a huge difference between not forcing a relationship and actively shutting the kids out. Just wanted to clear that up.", "Not shipped off forever... but every once in a while isn't such a horrific thing ffs. I'm not saying she should send them to boarding school", "And what exactly should op's sister do? The kids don't think of her as family. They even cut her out of pictures. How is her daughter gonna be treated by them?", "No it's not horrific. Even I stayed with my grandparents on and off for months during my childhood. But it entirely depends on the context of what else is going on. In this situation the father, Declan, has already severely damaged his relationship with his children by steaming ahead just 1 year after the kids mother died with a new relationship and being blind towards his kids obviously not having healed. Now just when they have a new baby and when the kids finally opened up to their father about what they're hurt and angry about would be the WORST time to send them off anywhere. The message they'd be sending the kids-\n1) we don't want to hear how you're hurt \n2) we don't care\n3) we are punishing you for telling the truth about how you feel\n4) now that we have a new baby, you are less important to us\n\nHonestly if you can't understand how damaging this is given the context of THIS particular situation, I don't think there's any point in even continuing this conversation.  And I especially don't understand why you ever referred to the kids as spoilt brats. They've done nothing bratty here. In fact, if anyone has behaved like a spoilt brat here it's their immature father who seems to just want it all with no consideration towards anybody else's feelings. I won't be responding again since I've said all I've had to say and I'm not particularly interested in going round and round in circles.", ">especially don't understand why you ever referred to the kids as spoilt brats.\n\nWaiting till stepmom leaves the room cause she's not family, cutting her out of pictures. I get they don't love her, cool. She probably isn't crazy about them either. But they should still respect her as their dad's wife."]}
