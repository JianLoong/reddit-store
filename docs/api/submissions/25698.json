It\u2019s rather sad that a third party could see that they were unhappy with the situation, but their father buried his head in the sand.

If they were both too involved in themselves to not notice the kids, I bet a virtual beverage OP's observations would not been well received.  I very much feel where these kids are coming from. Some of it is completely natural and unavoidable, but a larger part is Declan and Emily messed up big time in being blind to their needs.", "NTA.

If I were her I'd be more concerned about dating someone who has children whose wife (and children's mother) passed away just 1 year ago. It should be obvious to anyone with any common sense that 1 year is not enough for children to heal from the loss of a parent and that they would totally feel like their father was just rushing to replace their mother. \n\nYou- also a milder ah. This is your sister. And you sound quite close. I have a sister too and I would've absolutely said something. Gently and compassionately, yes but I definitely would've said something.

She'll be feeling pretty insecure and hurt, I feel for her, and so so much for the kids. I've been a part of a family like this, they may well come around yet, but I hope they give the kids space and permission to feel the way they do.\n\nI hope she has some support or considers therapy, blended + grieving family dynamics are tough and personally I don't think they're to be navigated alone - especially for the kids' sake.", "NAH. This was a no win situation. Because had you read the situation wrong then you could have potentially got the backlash for \"trying to start drama where there wasn't any\".\n\nReally the husband is the one responsible for how this played out. It seems the kids didn't have the necessary time to properly grieve their mother before he moved on. I mean how long was she dead before he started dating your sister?\n\nI'm sure the 11 and 10 year old really struggle because they were on the younger side, so their memories of their mom could be very limited. \n\nI hope in the future the situation works out the best way it can for everyone.", "NTA. This is one of those moments of \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\".

You should have told her, if only for the sake of the children who had her imposed on them against their wishes. \n\nHowever, she chose to ignore their obvious discontent because she wanted her husband. \n\nMy only sympathy is for the children who had no say in this. There really should be laws protecting children from parents who force unwanted people into their homes. It's very unfair and emotionally abusive to do that to children.", "NAH\n\nI do think this was somewhat no-win, as too many times people will find a way to blame you for knowing regardless of telling them early on or too late. You felt it was better to stay out of her business, and that isn't an AH thing, nor would I consider your sister the AH for feeling upset about how her stepkids view and treat her.

I feel like Emily could have been naive and explained away some more obvious things as being in her head or not the way she saw it initially. On the other hand I could see it as her putting it down to their personalities and them being introverted.

Doesn't reddit aita says stepmother shouldn't force their stepkids to create a raport?? I mean, reddit aita isn't really the place for that, because they hate stepmothers no matter what they do, but still.

I'm one guy offering an opinion and I've never stated the things you say, you're putting words in my mouth at that point by making a massive generalisation.

How is her daughter gonna be treated by them?", "No it's not horrific. Even I stayed with my grandparents on and off for months during my childhood. But it entirely depends on the context of what else is going on. In this situation the father, Declan, has already severely damaged his relationship with his children by steaming ahead just 1 year after the kids mother died with a new relationship and being blind towards his kids obviously not having healed. Now just when they have a new baby and when the kids finally opened up to their father about what they're hurt and angry about would be the WORST time to send them off anywhere. The message they'd be sending the kids-\n1) we don't want to hear how you're hurt \n2) we don't care\n3) we are punishing you for telling the truth about how you feel\n4) now that we have a new baby, you are less important to us\n\nHonestly if you can't understand how damaging this is given the context of THIS particular situation, I don't think there's any point in even continuing this conversation.  And I especially don't understand why you ever referred to the kids as spoilt brats. They've done nothing bratty here. In fact, if anyone has behaved like a spoilt brat here it's their immature father who seems to just want it all with no consideration towards anybody else's feelings.

I am guessing not. That's not your fault, though.\n\nI am guessing your sister never asked about the kids going to therapy either. I imagine that I'd wonder about this if I were in her shoes.\n\nI think that you should have said something to your sister as soon as you realised the kids were refusing to see your sister as some part of their family or as someone who would one day be part of their family. The kids' current views are awful, and considering the two youngest ones were only 5 and 6 when their mother died, I wonder how much of their current opinion is really theirs or is based on seeds that the oldest child may have put in their minds.\n\nConsidering they now have a baby, your sister can't just walk away. Her options now are continuing to live with three kids that just tolerate her but that really don't want her around, for at least the next 8 years when the youngest turns 18 and might move out. Another options is to leave and be a single mother. Finally, the best option would be for the kids to get individual and family therapy (that your sister isn't part of) to learn to accept that their mother is dead and that their father has moved on. The father was only 31 when he became a widower. What did the kids expect, that he'd remain single for the rest of his life?! Of course they are too young to have thought about things from their father's perspective, that's where therapy can help. And the father needs to understand the difficulties his kids have with coming to terms with the loss of their mother and with him introducing another woman in their life. Maybe therapy that your sister is also part of would also be good.\n\nAnyhow, in the end I think you did the wrong thing by keeping your observations to yourself. It suggests that you didn't look out for your sister when she was making a big decision that ended up affecting her whole life (because she just had a baby with this man). Sometimes you need to say things even if you aren't explicitly asked for your opinion.

None of us went to another therapy session for 6 years, and even that was just me sitting in on my boyfriend's therapy session at his request.

I\u2019m pretty sure if you\u2019d told her before she would\u2019ve freaked out, denied that you could be telling the truth, or gone through with it.

Marriage is going to take a massive toll, especially with a new baby. She thought she was a part of the family, but she's a total stranger, a third wheel. It hurts. It hurts a lot. You'd hope your family pre warn you about something like that even if you won't listen to it at first. Shes playing out the what ifs and is probably greatly regretting this marriage. \nDo you care for your sister? If she has just recently given birth, post partum is easy to trigger. So maybe offer some support and make yourself available. Its liklely because of the new baby theres that much more isolation and resentment thats throen her way. Noone deserves to be in those shoes.", "She\u2019s looking for someone to blame and right now you\u2019re an easy target - but don\u2019t accept any blame here. \n\nDeclan is the real AH here. If he put those kids first he would have known this before he got married.  \n\nYour sister needs to be confident in her place as his wife and their new family, but she needs to back off from those kids. I would encourage her to tell them that, and to apologize for making assumptions or casually mentioning their mom. \n\nThis is Declan\u2019s mess to fix, and they would all benefit from group therapy separately and together.  She should be pushing this on him and working with him on sorting this out. \n\nThey may not ever like her, but they can tolerate and respect her.  She needs to learn that they might never come around and be ok with that.  And Declan needs to step up and own his actions so that he can proactively fix this.", "NTA it's one of those \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situations. No win all around.", "NTA.   And they have been married three years and never knew.   She had her head in the sand.   You talking to her wouldn't have brought it out.   She wasn't ready for that.   Declan is a bit of an asshole.   Really needed some better conversations with the kids.", ">It was clear that Emily was trying to bond with the kids and they had walls up where she was concerned. Emily did not seem to notice and I debated speaking to her but I felt it wasn't really my place, because surely it was something at least Declan would notice and they would discuss.\n\nHonestly, you're kind of right here. If Emily didn't notice it was willful ignorance packed full of dreams and ambitions of probably stepping in and being their replacement mother. It always is. As for their father, he likely was so desperate for a new companion he was willfully ignorant as well.\n\n> Declan asked them why they waited for Emily to leave the room to speak and they said because he called it a family meeting, so they waited for it to be just the family.\n\nF in chat for your sister, but damn do those kids know how to make a statement.\n\n>She asked why I didn't tell her this. I told her I honestly considered it but feared it was both not my place and not something she would respond well to.\n\nBecause she wouldn't. I've no stats to call on, but I think everyone has heard of or seen someone who is so all in on a goal they ignore or even disdain anything that gets in their way. Your sister would have gotten pissed and dug her heels in if you suggested she wasn't going to achieve a relationship with them, hell she'd have pressed upon them while maintaining they were all a big happy family.\n\n>Emily told me I should have told her. That I'm her sister and I could have helped her go into her marriage with open eyes, I could have helped her consider whether marrying Declan was the right thing to do. She said I betrayed her by not saying anything.\n\nOf course, now she's blaming you rather than own her mistakes here. It's all not terribly unexpected.\n\nNTA", "Why can\u2019t people move on?

She had been a caretaker for him for seven years before he died. He was 79, she was 80. She was done. She made all their money through smart investments (they both had jobs, but they had MONEY because of her). She knew that she would end up caretaking yet again and it would be her money paying for it.

I know that men move on quicker in the first place after the death of a spouse, but I\u2019ve never seen any data that specifically associates happiness in the marriage with it. It\u2019s super interesting. \nThe only way for it to be a somewhat reliable report that isn\u2019t impacted by grief and memory, is for it to be a longitudinal study that assessed happiness during the previous marriage.

It's been four decades. Nothing changed.\n\nBoth Emily and Declan are disconnected from those children's emotional needs.

I doubt any kids who have lost a parent are happy when their remaining parent remarries.

Neither one of them cared about the children's feelings before making any decisions and at their ages they're very perceptive.", "There's also a lot of people who, especially after decades of someone being there, would rather have ANYONE there than be alone. Generally I've noticed this with people who get married right out of school or uni, they've probably never lived alone ever and can't even begin to do it now. My dad died at 56 and my mums fairly content to be alone and has worked on a friend circle and joining kniting or crochet groups around her, she struggled more during covid of course because she's a social creature. But she learnt those skills even though she was married right of her parental home at 18, her first husband left her with three kids under the age of 7. She figured out how to be alone - all be it with kids - for almost a decade before she decided to marry again. \n\nFor someone who's lost that person they'd been with for 30 years that need and reliance on company of any sort can outweigh the loss of that loved one. Which is often why they seem to grab onto the first man or woman to show intrest even if they're not right. That is actually what my dad thought my nan did, but it became clear that the man I knew as my grandad was not any port in a storm for he she spent 3 or 4 years grieving (drunk if truth be told he'd never seen her drink so much in all his life my dad said) before she met the man I knew as my grandfather, and boy howdy dis he love her so much. And us grandkids. \n\nMy dad wouldn't have a bar of it refused to like him at all which was always a shame but, we loved him so much and he loved my nan. I emigrated so I didn't get to go to her funeral, but when I went to my dads funeral only 6 years later, I visited my grandfather and he had the house and garden exactly as she liked it. She'd made him promise to look after her garden, just as they had together for 25+ years, as she got frail he did the heavy lifting and she gave the orders, and it looked just as it had the last time I'd visited her. \n\nMy dad never knew he was still so devoted to her even in death and idk if that would have ever changed his feelings about him but I doubt it. It's different for the kids in these things, it always is. \n\nSorry I'm.on strong pain killers and they make me ramble and tell sad stories. I can just see how sometimes it's hard to be alone. Though with the op I don't think it's OK to move on so fast with kids so young, it's not ok for them it really isn't, they process slower and it's different for them, you only get one set of parents. And one of them was gone forever it's harder or at least very different as a teen or kid to deal with when your mommy's gone.", "Nta, if you had said something, you would most likely be called crazy & they wouldn't believe it anyway.", "So she\u2019s mad that you who weren\u2019t around the kids every day like she was saw something she was clearly too oblivious to see.

I was even more confused and asked why and he said he loved being married so much and sharing his life with someone so much he couldn't wait to do it again.
