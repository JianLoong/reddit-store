I would take it for granted that the driver can use any of the basic functions of the car, especially the ones related to safety. It\u2019s not like you changed the settings on the GPS or reprogrammed the sound system. Is she usually finicky or controlling about other things?", "NTA.

Why would something so insignificant bother her? This is just weird! Was she in a bad mood and just hunting for something to fight about? It\u2019s neither rude nor something you should have to ask permission before doing.", "Is she super poor or something? Using the windshield wipers is not something you need to ask, you drive thus you decide if it is needed. Your gf was or is either very poor and can\u2019t afford to refill the fluids, or she is just weird in a not cool way.", "Is this real?", "NTA", "NTA", "I read your title two times, because i thought you took smenones wipers and used them on your car. Didn't get how that would work. lol\n\nThat's really wierd imo. Maybe she says that because of the fluid? Because you used much of it and she can't afford new fluid... I don't know. Just looking for an explanation i guess haha.", "That\u2019s really weird that she got mad about that. NTA.", "Agreed, i had to read this 3 times to understand what was happening and why she was upset..\n\nHonestly, I expected op to have taken someone's wipers off their car and put it on his own car to drive around...\n\nIm a professional passenger, i seriously dislike driving and will avoid it at any cost possible, but it is my understanding that its up to the driver to decide how happy they are with visbiqnd if its safe to proceed, it has nothing do with the passengers.", "'I didn't give you permission to tell those other drivers where we are going!\"", "My mother used to complain about me using it when I was young and still using her car.

OP, next time it happens, ask your girlfriend, \"Well, would you prefer I crash your car, possibly even total it, injure us both or maybe even kill us? Or can I ACTUALLY have the ability to SEE out of the windshield, so that I won't do that?\"", "SO odd. NTA.", "Yeah, this is the one I was looking for.  Driver is in command of the car and all the car's utilities, including the windshield wiper fluid.  Once you allow someone to control your car, it is assumed that you allow them to control any aspect of the car that they need to drive.  If they need the radio tuned to the big band swing station to drive, then you do it.", "Exactly. I was thinking I would be answering differently as my husband turns on wipers and reaches over to fiddle with things near the steering wheel when *I* am driving and that annoys me/distracts me. \n\nIMO the driver should be the one doing anything to do with the car's operation/controls/visibility etc. OP is NTA.", "That\u2019s why i posted. It was so weird.  I really wondered if I was missing something", "This is it \ud83d\udcaf . It has absolutely zero to do with the wipers, he's done something else 'wrong' and is oblivious to the transgression.", "Joey: \u201cDid you just smell my sandwich?

Red flag", "I\u2019m sorry, what now? This is extraordinarily dangerous and also really bizarre. If your husband is just extraordinarily bad at the kind of basic reasoning we all use to keep ourselves alive, maybe explain to him (very slowly and in simple language to be sure he catches it) why he shouldn\u2019t do this. Ever. To anyone. Like for real, full stop, no joke. Wow. \n\nIf instead he is of normal intelligence / awareness, maybe consider sleeping with one eye open and never ever under any circumstances driving with him in the car again. This is not normal and, I can\u2019t emphasize this enough, *not safe.* If not for your own sake, for the love of anyone else on the road (and um, anywhere nearby a road), please, address this. One unexpected situation where you need to react quickly as the driver while he\u2019s got his hands and arms in between / around the controls for the giant instrument of death you are causing to hurtle down the road at high speeds can spell disaster. It not having happened yet is in no way a guarantee it won\u2019t happen in the future. Your attention needs to be on the road, not on who is getting handsy with the cruise control button.", "Could she be mad at you for something else?", "Never, ever heard of such a thing. How long has she been your gf because that\u2019s not even in the realm of being reasonable behavior. \ud83d\udea9", "I don\u2019t think you are \u2026 it\u2019s just an odd thing to get mad at. She might as well told you that you should have asked to use the brakes.", "If I had to guess, she took you using the windshield wipers as you saying her car was dirty. Like you were judging her. So, so silly, but I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s what it is. My mum would take so many seemingly innocent things personally, so I\u2019m used to having to decipher odd overreactions! NTA at all.", "I think you possibly are missing something, but this isn't about the Iranian Yogurt.\n\nNTA for using her windshield wipers, but is it possible she's pissed off about something else that you're oblivious to? That's the only thing that could explain so strong a reaction to something so harmless, as far as I can see.", "NTA\n\nThe person driving is the one who gets to decide if the wipers need using.", "Haha yeah or that!! I\u2019m trying to imagine his face actually when his girlfriend was having a go at him because I\u2019d be like what planet am I seriously on right now?", "Yes I know. I am not sure why he does it/did it, perhaps as he wasn't used to other people driving but in no way was I accepting of it and i was clear in letting him know that. \n\nBut when I read the title of this post I thought it would be something similar ."]}
