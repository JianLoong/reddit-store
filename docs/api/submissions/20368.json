Using the windshield wipers is not something you need to ask, you drive thus you decide if it is needed.", "I\u2019d guess they drive an automatic. I drive manual and would obviously never park without the handbrake set.", "If he had an automatic, there\u2019s (essentially, see reply if you want more technical details) a parking pin that gets set when you put the car out of gear. It doesn\u2019t stay in neutral like it does in a manual. In the US for example, it\u2019s hit or miss if anyone ever uses the parking brake (most automatics have them in the floor not at hand now a days but it used to be hand brakes more common). Anyway, I learned to drive on a manual, and my ex husband owned a manual, so I set mine 100% of the time from the habit I learned when I learned to drive and to not be out of it when I drove his. But this is incredibly rare, and becoming more rare. The only manuals [even available now](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g20734564/manual-transmission-cars/) are sports cars or expensive BMW types so it\u2019s not even possible to buy one for a family any longer unless you get a used one\u2014and the year models are further and further back. The last manual family car we bought was a 2014 for example. \n\nAnyway, engaging parking brakes on an automatic are not needed with one exception\u2014if someone hits your parked car at just the right angle, the parking pin can break and then it\u2019s like you\u2019re in neutral. Of course majority of Americans park in their own private driveways off street, or in a car park so also rarely an issue.", "I think it depends on whether the car is manual or automatic. In my manual car that I used to have I did use the handbrake. In my current car I just put it in park. I should add I live in the flattest country in the world. When I'm in a country with hills or mountains I do engage the handbrake. Also, if I'm in a big city and all the cars are parallel parked very closely together, it's better not to engage the handbrake because cars will often nudge other cars when parking.", "Part of me wonders if she just needs a snack \ud83d\ude02 this is the kind of thing I could see someone getting weirdly upset about when they\u2019re hangry.", "My mum probably: \u201cCan you believe he just went ahead and used the wipers? I only had the car cleaned last week. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the cleanliness of the car. So rude!!!\u201d", "I was thinking this too. And she may have been a little hangry\u2026. Probably a good time to get her a snack!", "I think so, too. I think op may have crossed her boundary somewhere else, and she's mad at him. But gf is not communicating her issues.", "I think so, too. I think op may have crossed her boundary somewhere else, and she's mad at him. But gf is not communicating her issues.", "You can actually park with a manual 'safer' and with less damage than an auto. You just leave it in gear. Park in an auto is less well built than a gearbox and can damage or break. Though you gotta remember if you try and start it in gear lol", "This is not quite accurate on the parking pawl (not pin) part. In an automatic, you should use the parking brake (especially on hills), the parking pawl can disengage or fail when vehicle is hit, or on a steep grade, but it doesn't necessarily break. It keeps try to move into another slot on the output shaft. You'll hear a clicking noise relative to speed as the pawl bounces over the grooves on the output shaft, trying to re-engage. Once it's slowed enough, it will automatically re-engage so long as it wasn't severely damaged. \n\nSo, using the parking brake in an automatic can reduce the risk of costly repairs to the transmission due to parking on hills, or even being hit by another car. It will also help your car stop faster if it's hit while parked as the brakes are engaged and the pawl is not rolling across the shaft.", "We could all use a snack! So many conflicts could be avoided!", "I didn\u2019t realize other people who drove manual left it in neutral when they parked! Learn something new every day haha.", "My wife made fun of me for using my parking break on my automatic car, then we got a recall notice that the parking pawl was failing on this model and needed replaced. The solution was to use the parking break until it could be replaced.", "Yes, your explanation is more accurate (and a really good, simple technical version), but I was going for a quick ELI5 version. Explaining it as a pin kept it elementary enough for people unfamiliar with the engagement\u2014most would have to google the word pawl. The mechanism breaks down, even if the part itself doesn\u2019t. \n\nI agree with you (as stated I engage it 100% of the time) but I\u2019ve never known a person who has never driven a manual who does. I don\u2019t think the average American is taught to do so. I\u2019ve even heard people erroneously refer to it as \u201can emergency brake\u201d and the idea of someone trying to throw the handbrake to stop in an emergency is astonishing. You\u2019d lose complete control of the vehicle and only extremely professional drivers really know how to use the handbrake to drift and such.

I obviously don\u2019t know, but trying to leave space for the possibility that the girlfriend isn\u2019t totally crazy for not wanting the wipers to run and just didn\u2019t handle it well. OP is definitely not rude for using them.", "Right! This is so bizarre. I hope you never need to use the bathroom at her house.", "\"You're going to use up all my expensive blinker fluid!\"", "SO odd. I read the title and was trying to guess what OP did, the only way he would have been the AH was if OP removed the windshield wipers and put them on his own car without asking. That would have also been odd.", "Has to be.
