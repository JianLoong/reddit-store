Our relationship is not good either. One of the biggest reasons is my parents flipped the script with my siblings when it came to gifts for Christmas and Birthdays. My siblings are 16, 14, and 11 so four years between me and their next kid. I know it's a bigger gap than say two years but it's not huge either. Yet they parented them so differently and spoiled them.\n\nFor me, gifts were needs and not wants and I was told I should be appreciative of having food in my belly, a roof over my head and clothes on my back. If I asked for something I wanted they would tell me I didn't need it. I didn't need a doll, I didn't need art supplies, I didn't need a toy kitchen. They never ever said that to my siblings. They would get dolls, action figures, bikes, trampolines, paint sets, jewelry kits, all kinds of fun toys. They also got cell phones and tablets when they got older. I normally got clothes. Sometimes I would get cheap ass basic hygiene products (body wash and stuff). My parents made it a huge point to nip it in the bud when I was upset with my underwhelming gifts. Especially when my siblings came along. They told me they were babies, they were little, etc. But that energy was never there for me.\n\nI do resent it. Yeah, I had all the basics, but my siblings had so much more than that. My siblings are also very spoiled and entitled because of it. My sister (16) used to bug me and get frustrated with me for not having nice stuff she could borrow. She asked me once what was the point in having a sister if she couldn't raid my closet. I told her it wasn't my fault our parents didn't buy me nice shit like her. She laughed and told me that's what being the oldest means. My brothers would tell me to buy them stuff and say they got pocket money so I did too (I never got pocket money). When I explained that I didn't it would end with them saying I was a baby.\n\nI moved out of my parents house and in with my aunts. I stayed with them for several months when I started college and now I share an apartment with some friends while we all attend college. I also work.\n\nMy parents have fallen on hard times now and right before Christmas. They told me they didn't have the money to get my siblings what they want for Christmas and told me I needed to let them borrow money or buy the gifts on their behalf and they would pay me back. I told them it's not my job to provide for my siblings when they cannot. They argued that my siblings would be disappointed to get nothing from their wish lists. I told them they don't need nice gifts, they only need clothes and food and a roof over their heads and they have all that.\n\nMy parents said I'm a terrible big sister.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700590837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180nk5z/aita_for_telling_my_parents_its_not_my_job_to/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First and foremost, it is not your responsibility to provide for your siblings, as you said, they have everything they need along with nice things they already have. It's your parents fault for raising yours siblings in a way that they will be unhappy if they don't get things from their wishlist. Not that gift giving should be about \"getting credit\", but because you'd be helping pay for the gifts, it's not like you'll be getting any of the credit either. If they're only able to get a couple of gifts they want, you're not going to get any credit for helping out to make that happen. In fact, your parents are already using this as a way to guilt trip you, so if someone complains, I have no doubt they'd use you as a scapegoat.", "No, it\u2019s time your siblings had a taste.

Get them cheap ass hygiene products and when they/your parents complain tell them all that since that's what you always got for Christmas that's what you thought Christmas gifs were supposed to be. Yes your siblings are kids and products of how your parents raised them, but they're also old enough to be kind and see reality.", "Basically, you feel that you didn\u2019t get enough gifts as a child so now you want to make sure your siblings don\u2019t.

I am so happy that karma visited in such a timely manner!! Stand your ground!", "Info: are you the oldest of four?  You listed 4 different ages for your siblings.", "NTA karma in its finest form . I\u2019m sorry you were treated that way . I have 4 kids my eldest is 9 years older than the next one . I spend exactly the same on all 4 and make sure to get what they want, within reason . They are all treated exactly the same . The fact that you were given the bare MINIMUM is absolutely disgusting !", "Your parents suck.

You handled that well actually. You answered their call whereas most wouldn't.

Ok my opinion might be extreme but even if your parents treated you fairly, they have no rights to demand that you give money for the young siblings\u2019 gifts. It\u2019s not your responsibility.

Oldest of four. Edited that.", "No reason to buy them gifts at all IMO.", "Maybe because they think you just deserve less. \n\nAnd doesn\u2019t that just give you a warm\nand comfy feeling :(", "All the more reason to be an \u201cabsolutely not\u201d", "What exactly do your parents have against you?
