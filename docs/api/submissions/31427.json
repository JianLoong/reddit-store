Our relationship is not good either. One of the biggest reasons is my parents flipped the script with my siblings when it came to gifts for Christmas and Birthdays. My siblings are 16, 14, and 11 so four years between me and their next kid. I know it's a bigger gap than say two years but it's not huge either. Yet they parented them so differently and spoiled them.\n\nFor me, gifts were needs and not wants and I was told I should be appreciative of having food in my belly, a roof over my head and clothes on my back. If I asked for something I wanted they would tell me I didn't need it. I didn't need a doll, I didn't need art supplies, I didn't need a toy kitchen. They never ever said that to my siblings. They would get dolls, action figures, bikes, trampolines, paint sets, jewelry kits, all kinds of fun toys. They also got cell phones and tablets when they got older. I normally got clothes. Sometimes I would get cheap ass basic hygiene products (body wash and stuff). My parents made it a huge point to nip it in the bud when I was upset with my underwhelming gifts. Especially when my siblings came along. They told me they were babies, they were little, etc. But that energy was never there for me.\n\nI do resent it. Yeah, I had all the basics, but my siblings had so much more than that. My siblings are also very spoiled and entitled because of it. My sister (16) used to bug me and get frustrated with me for not having nice stuff she could borrow. She asked me once what was the point in having a sister if she couldn't raid my closet. I told her it wasn't my fault our parents didn't buy me nice shit like her. She laughed and told me that's what being the oldest means. My brothers would tell me to buy them stuff and say they got pocket money so I did too (I never got pocket money). When I explained that I didn't it would end with them saying I was a baby.\n\nI moved out of my parents house and in with my aunts. I stayed with them for several months when I started college and now I share an apartment with some friends while we all attend college. I also work.\n\nMy parents have fallen on hard times now and right before Christmas. They told me they didn't have the money to get my siblings what they want for Christmas and told me I needed to let them borrow money or buy the gifts on their behalf and they would pay me back. I told them it's not my job to provide for my siblings when they cannot. They argued that my siblings would be disappointed to get nothing from their wish lists.

They are using you as Bank of Firstborn Child and that is both exploitation and financial abuse in my books. They are not helping either by raising a bunch of self entitled kids who think it is okay to financially use someone \n\nDon't let the parents guilt or manipulate you. Stand your ground and tell them a big NO. You are NOT financially responsible for your siblings, your parents are. If your parents cannot afford to buy things for their younger kids then they not should not have more kids to begin with\n\nThis is my advice to you now: I suggest you start protecting your money and your assets by getting some advice from a financial expert at your uni to find out how you can protect your money and assets if anything unforseen happens to you. Make a will where you get to decide where your money goes so that your entitled parents cannot get their hands on them.\n\nBe a few steps ahead by looking into the legal part to ensure that parents cannot name you as legal guardian of your younger minor siblings when you least know it.

All kinds of cool shit.\n\nSo yeah, I feel ya lol.  I felt a bit of resentment back then too.  By 18 I was working and paying rent to keep living at home and buying my own shit too.

But, life has a way of giving you better opportunities as it goes on and I get that a big reason my brothers had it better is my parents had more income after me and my older brother became adults.  And maybe they felt a little bad that me and my older brother had it so hard, and giving my younger brothers more was ways to make up for that since they finally could.\n\nSo, if your parents' household had similar circumstances, I think I could see how your siblings might have been dealt a better hand too.

I have no idea why they're being so cruel to you, but they are, and it's so so so not ok. Common parts of being the oldest are parents being a bit stricter on the rules, maybe not getting big things like computer and phone as early as younger siblings, maybe being expected to do more chores and stuff, but that's because parents are still figuring this stuff out, and what's normal is them realizing they're adjusting their approach, acknowledging it, and also changing for the oldest as well. \n\nThis is so far from that it's not in the same category.

I assume you're close with your aunts, since you moved in with them - could you ask them about it? Maybe they have more information that could put in context why your parents treated you so differently, because you're right, it's not a big enough age gap to explain it.

My sister, the middle child, reminded my mother of herself, so was a golden child who got everything. I, however, reminded my mother of her own younger brother, whom she hates because of how my grandparents treated him and she was so determined not to spoil the baby of the family that she treated me exactly like yours did. For example, we were \"homeschooled.\" My mom would make a single version of say a geography quiz for all three kids. So it was two grades below what my brother should have been doing, so easy for him. It was grade appropriate for my sister, so she did well. But it was two grades above me, so I struggled. Same with gifts, I remember one year I was so excited because I was given a PS2, but had to agree to let my siblings play it, which was fine. But they were allowed to play it first, and would always be allowed to play it first, I would always be last in turn, for something that was my birthday gift.

But they are wrong, and she may have been fine before there were siblings and anything else to compare to but she's certainly not fine anymore after 16 years of being treated as less than her sibs.
