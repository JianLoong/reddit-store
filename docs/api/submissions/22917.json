We have decided that come monday, I will be going to the police with these messages and bring not only doctor notes but notes from my therapist to show the negative affects this action has had on me. I do have the folger container with the coffee he exchanged it with. I am not at home but I do have my brothers Aspending the night there for the next few days just in case he does show up. I will be doing my best to talk to the police, lawyers, and whoever else I can to pursue charges and sue if I can. I also plan to change my locks and install cameras. If anything else happens or I get more information on what I can do I will Keep you updated to the best of my ability.\n\nAlso, for every one who is like why take the risk of drinking coffee, I totally get where your going, and there's no offense taken at all when the worries of my caffeine intake come in. I was diagnosed with a caffeine intolerance at 21 years old and I am now 29 going on 30 soon. For the first year after the diagnosis, I talked to many doctors and found out the things that caused it. I when drinking 120-160 mg of caffeine, have an adverse affects. I haven't had one in eight years before these last two weeks. Folgers the coffee I drink has only 14 mg of caffeine per ounce I drink about 4 ounces of coffee, mixed with 2 ounces of water and 2 ounces of creamer. Thats the only coffee I drink one 8 ounce cup of joe with only 28 mgs of caffeine in it made at home a specific way. I don't drink coffee from stores, or drink coffee other people offer me or make for me nor do I buy any other coffee aside from folgers. I've done this for years and have once again not had an adverse affect in 8 years.

NTA... stay the hell away from him!", "And he thought it was FUNNY. He\u2019s the one who has some real mental issues.", "Just to be clear: he didn't stop because OP discovered the evidence. His response to that was to laugh and justify poisoning OP. \n\nHe *was* stopped, and the only reason he hasn't continued to do this or similar is solely and exclusively that he no longer has the access to do it.", "Not potentially. It WAS dangerous and it had the only possible effect - harming OP by causing heart palpitations and auditory hallucinations. OP - please, please don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you\u2019re overreacting. This was a malicious, incredibly cruel act.", "Of course mommy was going to call her and try to convince her it was no big deal. If she can't foist the festering turd back onto the OP, she'll get stuck with him moving back in with her.

I was diagnosed with a caffeine intolerance at 21 years old and I am now 29 going on 30 soon. For the first year after the diagnosis, I talked to many doctors and found out the things that caused it. I when drinking over 160 mg of caffeine, have an adverse affect. I haven't had one in eight years before today after finding this out. Folgers the coffee I drink has only 14 mg of caffeine per ounce I drink about 4 ounces of coffee, mixed with 2 ounces of water and 2 ounces of creamer. Thats the only coffee I drink one 8 ounce cup of joe with only 28 mgs of caffeine in it made at home a specific way. I don't drink coffee from stores, or drink coffee other people offer me or make for me nor do I buy any other coffee aside from folgers. I've done this for years and have once again not had an adverse affect in 8 years. There was no risk until he did this.", "Devils mountain black label ground coffee", "Also keep the coffee bag as evidence in case he says you hallucinated that as well.", "Also a crime.", "Repeatedly. For weeks. And then laughed at the effects.", "It's outright depraved. He found it amusing to watch OP suffer physically and mentally.\n\nOP, this man is not safe for you. Please do not go back to him.

He's clearly trying to make light of your condition, thinking it's all in your head, gambling with your life and mental health just to attempt to prove himself right.", "I agree there has to be something seriously wrong with a person to do this. OP isn\u2019t some science experiment, it\u2019s disgusting. How far would the bf have taken it? It\u2019s scary to think about what else could have happened.

Trust your instincts, and keep him as your ex.", "Are you filing a police report? This guy is trying to do serious damage to you, with the potential of killing you.

He even admits he got off on watching the effects to you and your body - WHAT A SICK F*Ck!!!  What is wrong with these people ?!?!", "1555 mg of caffeine per cup!? That\u2019s almost 10 of my energy drinks and I try to limit those to one a day, max. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s your ex as of tonight, he could have done far more damage if you hadn\u2019t caught on when you did. \nThe fact he thought causing you harm was funny..I have no words, I\u2019m disgusted. Someone who loves or respects you would not find the idea of hurting you funny, they would be horrified. \nYou deserve better, send him back to his mother, they deserve each other.", "this is not a prank. Please dont let him near you again.", "Agree bf is a major AH, but why are you even drinking coffee period if you have s caffeine intolerance? Wouldnt it be easier to just not drink it? Or I guess drink decaf if you love the taste if coffee.", "Good for you bae", "omg! i took a caffeine pill that was 300 mg, and it made me throw up! that is an unimaginable amount of caffeine! please take it easy, i hope you start feeling better soon", "Good for you!", ">  1555 mg per cup, which is 6 times the caffeine of a normal cup of joe\n\nThat's *sixteen* cups of coffee (though many caffeine users do use oversize mugs that are more than one cup). It's also nearly four times the recommended daily limit. (There's a reasonable argument that a habitual user can tolerate more, but obviously a single cup with that much caffeine would have an effect.)", "Ok, you absolutely need to file a police report. Then you need to sue him for your medical bills, missed work and pain/suffering.  There is no way he can say it was a harmless park after you explain to the police he drove you to the hospital twice. This is assault and it\u2019s a crime.", "Contact the police. This is not okay.", "Op, hugs. Get the house checked completely. I'm wondering what else he's done. Could he have filmed you and shared his pranks? Or is this for only for his twisted pleasure? If there is a way to check electronics safely for any recordings, please do that.\n\nPlease don't trust him. He saw how severe your symptoms were, and still, he didn't come clean. What else has he done?\n\nHugs.", "I would talk to my doctor before going to s lawyer.  She will need to document the damage and the times she reacted.", "OP, PLEASE CHANGE THE LOCKS ON YOUR HOUSE!!!!  And your garage code.", "Im convinced that he intended on harming you. There is no other explanation for this. Please have those male family with you for any contact", "No, you definitely need others there when he gets his stuff for safety reasons.  Be sure you have something recording the entire time, without him knowing if it's possible and legal.  Hopefully, you can get a confession on tape.", "Your relatives should rough him up as a prank. It\u2019s harmless. I mean people laugh when someone trips and falls on the ground. Your relatives could help him trip and maybe fall on some fists. If I wound out someone I cared about  SO poisoned them, they would have to stop me because when I am done I would go to jail. \n\nThis is the most fucked up shit I have every read on the internet. He laugh and enjoyed your suffering. He lied. His broke ass wasted money while you were working extra.", "I've been scrolling through the comments.for a minute and it's strange more people haven't made the point that just because it's caffeine doesn't mean it's not just as serious as secretly dosing you with other legal chemicals.  \n\nI think people would a lot more upset if he was sneaking Adderall into your food.", "ah that makes for almost caffeine free indeed. If it works for you, enjoy! (I know I like my morning coffee\u2026)  \nBtw I\u2019ve been reading more comments, and I agree with the pressing charges btw. His behavior is sooooo disturbing, the stuff of true crime shows.  Stay safe!!!", "Agreed. She should contact the police. This is like giving peanuts to someone with an allergy.

I do plan to call the non-emergency line for the police to see if this is something that i can pursue charges on. I am also going to talk to my therapist about having her come with me to the station so she can help me share whats been going on with me for the last two weeks. I am keeping this up for any ideas of other things I should do or pursue as well.", "My doctor and I had a bunch of conversations when i first found out about my intolerance and after extensive research and conversations we found what worked for me. I'm 29, I have been drinking watered down coffee in this way for almost 8 years since being told I have an intolerance to coffee and this is what works for me. Would it be easier to not drink it at all? Sure. But I never had to worry about it because its something I fixed years ago and no one expects someone to change the folgers they've been drinking for years to turn into devils mountain black label coffee. Folgers has 14 mg of caffeine per ounce. My doctor and I measured my reactions and even tried different kinds to see what worked for me and thats what I do.", "He drove her to the hospital twice and didn't come clean. It only stopped when she found the package.", "I mean, technically, if he\u2019s given you more caffeine than a normal person should medically have AND knows you can only have a severely reduced amount than normal\u2026it could constitute an attempted poisoning. I don\u2019t know the laws where you are but I would file a police report regardless. At the LEAST it\u2019s officially on record and if he does something later to someone else\u2026it\u2019s there as a pattern. \n\nAlso, OP, you can talk to a lawyer and maybe sue him for the medical expenses, missed work, etc that his \u201cprank\u201d incurred. Just depends on how far down that path you want to go. I mean, if you\u2019re in the US you can sue for almost anything so\u2026yeah. But I have no tolerance for people who do shit like he did to you. :)", "This was going to be my suggestion. Then it won\u2019t be so funny. And his mother just doesn\u2019t want to deal with her prick of a son she didn\u2019t raise", "You\u2019re not going to get charges for someone accidentally giving themselves a greater-than-anticipated dose of caffeine. If nothing else, it\u2019d be considered OP\u2019s duty to take the due diligence of monitoring their intake; different coffee brands have different caffeine intakes, so to blindly drink a weighted amount of coffee without checking labels falls under your own liability.", "Not a suggestion for legal matters, but if you enjoy coffee look into 1/2 caffeinated or \"mommy roast\" as well as concentrates like javy. I've got a caffeine sensitivity that triggers migraines and can tip me into mania / make it worse. I've found the 2 options mentioned to be the best way to enjoy the flavor without my brain breaking. If you try javy I'd recommend using 1/2 a teaspoon to start instead of the 1-2tsp the bottle recommends.\n\nI'm really sorry you've been put through this and hope you're able to rest and recover peacefully with him out of the picture \ud83d\udc9c", "Glad you\u2019re considering pressing charges. This guy is actually dangerous. Who does this to their girlfriend, then laughs to their face?! Seriously baffling and creepy.", "If he\u2019s reached out to you at all, keep all communication with him for a paper trail. Ask him over text why he gave you that coffee, ask him to explain his prank, get him to admit to what he knowingly did. You can show that to the police as well. And you already have your therapist as a witness to the severity of effects his actions had on you. Best of luck!", "Good luck with this. You got it!", "Text the ex and try to get a confession from him via text.", "Fair enough, I drink coffee like a handful of times a year max and typically only if its really cold and im up super early or someone specifically offers/makes it for me and id feel rude declining so it just wouldn't be something I would even worry about. If you really enjoy coffee taste or are addicted to it then I understand it though. I know lots of people addicted to coffee or soda (really more of a caffeine addiction )", "Ask your therapist if this constitutes some type of assault - it should, since he knew the effects of caffeine on you... \n\nI mean, if they were making plans in case you have a \"break,\" due to this \"prank\", they may be willing to advocate for you in pressing charges... they can also testify to the mental health effects it had on you...", "If you had a food intolerance or allergy that made you throw up or break out in hives and you found out he was sneaking that food into your dinner and it caused trips to the hospital, it would be investigated. This is definitely the equivalent to that, if not worse. Please at least try to make a police report and press charges! You are NTA and he is a terrible, cruel, and dangerous person.", "if nothing insist they write up a report because if he is later accused by another person of domestic violence it'll be on file.

I was just thinking that, as a professional therapist, they'd have some experience or insight about abuse/domestic situations.\n\nI think that they are required to report abuse of minors or if a patient poses a danger to society, so they would likely have some knowledge about how OP can report this.\n\nAnd as OP's therapist, they can explain to [lawyer/cop/DA] just how seriously OP was affected by this and make it clear that it was an extremely harmful act.\n\nI'm assuming that if you tell a cop your bf poisoned you with caffeine, they're not going to take it as seriously as if it was arsenic, for example, just because caffeine is not usually considered to be poisonous... so having a medical professional testify to the harm caffeine has on OP may help them understand the gravity of the bf's actions.\n\nI hope I'm explaining this ok..."]}
