It sounds like he doesn\u2019t care about your feelings or wellbeing\n\nYou weren\u2019t overreacting.

He frickin experimented on you for a laugh.\n\nYou likely shared what was happening with him, and he just continued to sit back and watch it get worse and worse.\n\nAnd what people often forget is, coffee is a drug.

It\u2019s not embarrassing you it\u2019s not making fun of you it is basically akin to drugging you and thinking it\u2019s funny watching you unknowingly being under the influence. \n\nIt\u2019s something a child would think to be funny and a child is the only person that would be excused for such a behavior. \n\nYou did not state how old you guys are, but since you\u2019re working I don\u2019t believe that you are a child so I\u2019d advise you to not be in a relationship with one.
