The reason for this is my mom and I got into a car accident when I was 6. The accident took her from me and injured me badly and left me with a lot of psychological problems as well. Mainly because I was mostly conscious and I had to watch my mom die in front of me and I couldn't reach for her or help her. It was hours before we were found as well. My parents had been divorced and my dad was remarried with a baby on the way. Even though I had known and been close to my dad before my mom died, when she died I could not handle being around him and Nadia and in the hospital I suffered a lot with outbursts that led to panic attacks. It went on for long enough, and was bad enough for my recovery, that it was agreed I would go to live with my grandma from my mom's side but then both grandma's decided to come together, both being widows and me being their shared granddaughter to help me heal. They were monumental in my recovery. I had to do PT as well as see a psychiatrist and a play therapist to help with the psychological trauma I suffered.\n\nSo admittedly, I was comfortable with my grandmas and had wanted to stay with them even though I was in a place to live with my dad and Nadia again. But dad never wanted it to take four years, it just took that long because I didn't blend in seamlessly with Nadia or my half sister who was 3.5 at that point. \n\nNadia's mother was very present in Nadia's life and the lives of my half siblings. She considered me her oldest grandchild too but I never had any special kind of bond with her. That was reserved for the grandma's who had helped me. But Nadia's mom was special to everyone else.\n\nShe passed away in April and in June I gave birth to mine and my husband's first child, our daughter, Rosie, who is named after both my grandma's (one is Rosie, the other is Rose who always went by Rosie). My daughter's name made both my grandma's so happy. They still live together and are the best of friends and now get to enjoy their namesake. But Nadia, my half siblings and my dad are not happy that I chose to honor them when they were living but not Nadia's mom who had passed and considered me the oldest grandchild. In Nadia's family it's tradition that the first grandchild born after the passing of a grandparent be named after said grandparent and I didn't do that. Nadia and my half sister are especially bitter about my decision because they don't like that I never blended into the family my dad created the way they wanted me to and that I never embraced the fact I was accepted as the oldest grandchild by Nadia's mom. Months later and it turned into a heated discussion because my family and I are not joining them for Christmas. Nadia and my half sister said I was hateful for dissing their mom/grandma and for not honoring the acceptance from her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670499645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfwip5/aita_for_naming_my_daughter_after_both_my/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Baby name traditions are not an obligation. \n\nAccepting your daughter's step children as hers and treating them the same as her biological children is literally the expectation.

You wanted to honor your grandmothers and that\u2019s commendable.\n\nI can also understand their point of view if it\u2019s actually a real tradition in their culture to have first kids born after death of a grandparent using the name. I would have understood if they were just disappointed that you weren\u2019t interested in following through and then just moved on and accepted your decision. Everyone can have emotions, they\u2019re grieving someone who was not very important in your life but were essential in their life.

Good thing you broke that tradition\u2026", "I think it's a beautiful thing to name your daughter after the women who loved and cared for you.\n\nNadia is expecting too much and it sounds like it's a theme with her. So her tradition trumps what you went through and why you want to honor them? It trumps your want to name your child whatever you please?

They are being ridiculous. You chose to honor your grandmother's and you should be proud of that. Don't let anyone take that away from you.", "NTA- you're not Nadia's child so you have no obligation to follow her family traditions. It's great that you were accepted as the oldest grandchild, but your biological grandmothers raised you for a huge portion of your life. It makes sense that you'd want to name your daughter after them instead.", "NTA!\n\nLook, from what I see, this is your dad's fault. You said it yourself. He made it how they wanted you to be. Instead of just letting you be you. Even though she did accept you as the eldest grandchild, you never felt any connection to her or Nadia or your half siblings.  And that is totally normal. It's also normal to feel a special bond. So both are normal.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. This is just half-sister's chance to follow the tradition in her own family. If you are still in therapy, I would talk to your therapist about this. And maybe find a way with them to talk to your father about how he put you in this situation, by from what it sounds like trying to force it. You went through a seriously traumatizing situation, and then he tried to force you to be with him and his new family?\n\nNot to mention, it sounds like he didn't really want you to be with your grandmas because he wanted to try and be the one to help you so you would bond with Nadia and your half sister. He painted a picture that they fell for and refused to let go of even when faced with the truth that it was not going to happen.\n\nEver. Honestly, if they can not accept the fact that you just aren't what they want you to be because of how he painted it, and the fact that you just do not feel that bond at all with them....Then I say you should either go LC or NC...Because this will only get worse as things go. They all keep trying to force you to accept that you are family. Like what your grandmas did wasnt a big deal, and that they are number 1....", "Well, it's Nadia's family tradition so she should \"honor\" it.

You know - my solution to being bullied by family members was to pick a friend or relative who was the world's biggest gossip, and bring them to a family event, and wait for things to kick off, then give a full explanation afterwards, and watch it spread like wildfire.

They raised you for years and made you who you are.", "Your grandmothers are such wonderful people.
