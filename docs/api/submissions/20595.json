Set boundaries and enforce them (e.g. \u201cif you bring up your childhood again in the context of what my siblings and I deserve, I am leaving.\u201d). \n\nIt probably felt good to say it to him at the time, but this is also a maladaptive coping strategy - confrontation with no end goal.

If the circumstances are safe I would probably try to take the time to explain to your parents (maybe start one on one with your mom) in a level headed way that the emotional damage your father experienced is causing him to unknowingly inflict damage on his children and family, making them feel like they don't deserve good things. It may not have much effect but at least you can say you tried to address the elephant in the room and it may plant a seed in your mother's head that helps create change. \n\nA therapist could possibly help him to acknowledge that he had bad experiences growing up without constantly allowing him to pick at that festering wound or wound others in an attempt to make himself feel better. It really depends on if he's ready to take ownership of his emotions and stop hurting the people he cares about though.", "NTA, just told them the harsh truth and possibly made this a point that could save your long term relationship.

Your father is emotionally abusive and your mother is enabling him.", "ESH. You don\u2019t seem to recognize how privileged you are to be able to attend therapy, and that is built on the sacrifices your dad and his family had to make. While you are not responsible for his childhood, you can at least try to empathize more with what he went through. \n\nIf you think it\u2019s hard growing up being guilted for these things he didn\u2019t have, how much harder would it have been growing up experiencing these things? \n\nYour dad is trying to make sure you don\u2019t take these privileges for granted. The way he\u2019s going about that is not good, but that\u2019s also a product of his upbringing. My parents also grew up in poverty, so they\u2019ve also said similar things sometimes. The difference is that I know they\u2019re saying it as a cautionary advice not to take things for granted. \n\nAnd no, what your dad is doing isn\u2019t abuse, despite what the comments may say. He\u2019s not withholding necessities, nor is he being verbally abusive. He\u2019s just emotionally constipated, which is shitty, but does not amount to abuse. You can point out where he\u2019s going too far, but you should be mindful that you\u2019re still respectful. Appreciate that you\u2019re not growing up in poverty, because I\u2019ve seen the place my parents grew up in, and putting up with some nagging is a small price to escape poverty.
