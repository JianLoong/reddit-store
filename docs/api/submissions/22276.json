It was removed, but anyway\u2026Since then we talked and agreed we both treated each other poorly and would make it up to each other. We spent time together and were back on good terms. \n\nThe birthday dinner he planned for me was yesterday. This time in advanced, I sent him a list of options of activities I\u2019d like so there would be no ambiguity of what I expected. There were some nice fine dining restaurants, but also cheap options like a trip to Chinatown. I was really looking forward to it. When I asked if I should look nice for it he said yes.\n\nOn the day of, I got ready and looked my best. He ends up showing up over an hour late saying things took longer than expected to get ready. Not only that, he arrived stressed out with an attitude that he says because he was running late. He put a couple of unwrapped gifts (patio decor) on top of his car for me which were nice. I thanked him. \n\nHowever, it was hard to get past his attitude. He also went on about how everything he tried to book was all booked up. And when we finally got to the restaurant, I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment. It was nothing on my list. It was a decent Mexican restaurant I had been to before, but not anything I had in mind for my milestone birthday. I saw this day as the opportunity to make things right with something I\u2019d love. Instead, I feel like the whole date was really low effort and unimpressive. I felt insulted.\n\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy that dinner. So instead of wasting time, as soon as we were seated, I told him I\u2019d like to go elsewhere and got up and left. He followed me and tried to get me to go walk and talk. It was late, I was hungry and frustrated, and just wanted to go find a place I thought would be more enjoyable to make the most of the remainder of the night. He said he wanted to walk more to calm down, so I said OK and went to the bar of a restaurant on my birthday list. He agreed to meet up later. \n\nI asked him up to the bar for dinner and waited for him, but he refused to join me. I ate by myself. Then he drove me home, got his stuff (I gave him back his gifts while he was at it), and left. He says I\u2019m materialistic and care more about the venue than quality time. I think I have standards, self-respect, and need to stop settling for crumbs. I do not want nor need his money. The date didn\u2019t have to be extravagant, just something special to me. I wanted to feel valued on my special occasion, and that didn\u2019t happen.

Maybe this is really just an issue of not being compatible or him not making you feel loved in general.. but I\u2019m not a fan of people who want to feel \u201ccelebrated\u201d all the damn time .. I\u2019m not saying this to cut you down only to show that not everyone is like you. You wanting to be fawned over and making a big deal out of birthdays \u2026 which I do not consider special would drive me batshit crazy\u2026 I fin hate it\u2019s my birthday month people \u2026 so maybe consider this break up a good thing and find someone who shares your love and passion for celebrating each other in this way\u2026 find a guy just like you\u2026 I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s materialism you\u2019re looking for but love.. but honey you can\u2019t fill that hole this way.

Good riddance to incompatibility.. find a dude who speaks your love language", "I think you both behaved a bit off and both had reasons to be frustrated. \n\nYou have every right to be annoyed/saddened by his minimal effort. But to walk out of the restaurant? That was petty. \n\nInstead, you should have communicated your feelings about his attitude and his dinner choice. Then asked if you could start the night over with a clean slate.", "You sent him a list of places you wanted to go? Like a child writing to Santa. Maybe he wanted to plan things himself!\n\nYou stating that \"it's my milestone birthday\" says it all for me.. Grow up.. It's not that important.\n\nYTA... Walking out of the place he chose, giving him a list of places he had to choose from.. Smh", "ESH\n\nI understand wanting something sweet for a birthday or anniversary etc. It does help when your partner actively thinks of what you will like. This restaurant may not have been on your \"birthday list\" but you clearly have talked about it before and he remembered it as a place you wanted to try/a place you liked. \n\nHe clearly made the effort to try and do something you may enjoy even if he couldn't get into a fine dining place. Maybe if you want a specific thing, you should plan it yourself or perhaps be more realistic in your requests. I know the fine dining around here usually has a wait-list, so he literally may not have been able to get you a fancier place. \n\nHe is accurate in that you are materialistic if you throw a fit over a restaurant to this degree without asking for more info from him. Did he try to get reservations elsewhere? What what he planning that was frustrating? It isn't appropriate to have an attitude but you don't need to match fire with fire.\n\nHe potentially could have done better to plan, but you also could do better to not be completely ungrateful when he clearly just wanted to spend time with you and made an effort to get you something you wanted. If you want specific, plan it yourself otherwise don't take it out on your partner for not understanding your different \"lists\". Personally, this relationship sounds exhausting on both ends and if couples therapy isn't taken into consideration then I doubt this relationship will last.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My bet is that he tried to arrange it that evening and struggled because all the places he listed were not available. Either that or he liked that restaurant and chose it instead. Move on. My husband took me to my milestone birthday to a restaurant he loved and I hated. The food was awful, I mean really bad, and instead of inviting my friends, who told him to contact them so they could help arrange it, he decided to make it just a night for the two of us. The second stop was a bar that I did like, and he saw that the evening was not going well for him. Told him he couldn\u2019t drink, and I got plastered. 2\u2019d time in my life and I just turned 30. Well, got good and drunk and when we got home I told him I didn\u2019t drink enough for him to get lucky, nor would he for at least a month.", "I\u2019ll be honest, a list of acceptable restaurants sounds like a dream. I love when my wife requests things. Removes the guesswork.", "Nope.", "He requested the list. I wanted to feel special on this one particular milestone occasion which was important to me. I don\u2019t expect to be taken out all the time. In fact, it rarely happens in this relationship. I don\u2019t know what gives you the impression I do. I want to feel valued and appreciated regularly. I save celebrating for special occasions like this birthday.", "Yes, I will give it to him that he tried to do something I liked. I think he thought I would be impressed since the restaurant was on one of my old lists, not realizing that I had a different concept of an appropriate restaurant for this occasion. My thought is I would rather him postpone the date until he could get a reservation somewhere I was excited about and explicitly asked for rather than half ass it with whatever he could find that I had interest in at some point. By then my birthday already passed, so a week or so to get in somewhere wouldn\u2019t make much difference. \n\nI feel like I took part in planning by identifying and instructing him on exactly what I wanted. I did everything short of scheduling the date and making reservations. Doing that would completely eliminate any element of surprise, and we talked about wanting to surprise each other. Plus with him being a competent adult, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask of him to put in some effort. The list wasn\u2019t complicated. It simply stated the places or activities I would be interested in for my birthday with him. That should\u2019ve made things easier and less stressful.", "I think you\u2019re being rhetorical but I\u2019m going to take that question at face value. He and I are very different people but there\u2019s a depth to him and purity of heart that I feel privileged to know and love. He considers me an important part of his life, wants to do right by me, and doesn\u2019t always hit the mark but tries. He accepts my flaws and mistakes and I think it\u2019s only right to grant him the same in return. I saw us as a couple with issues to work through, but commitment to improvement and a hopeful future ahead of us.", "On what basis?", "I held off on ordering dinner with the hope that he would join me. He claimed he didn\u2019t like the way I interacted with him and wouldn\u2019t have a date with me under those circumstances. I\u2019ll admit I was irritated and disappointed and expressed that to him, and wasn\u2019t in a mood to walk and talk, but I didn\u2019t yell or make a scene. I was just focused on trying to turn things around with a plan B.", "Demanding in what way?", "Care to explain?", "I think it works best, too! Assuming the gifter actually uses it lol", "I would\u2019ve been happy eating at the bar of a restaurant I actually wanted to go to. On a birthday, it\u2019s about what the birthday person wants. If he wanted a motorcycle for his birthday and was excited about it, I wouldn\u2019t get him a regular bike and say sorry, no motorcycles were available. It misses the mark and shows thoughtlessness.", "You can't expect that we don't analyse your relationship when you are leaving a party the person you suppose to love organized.", "Ok well sorry, I tried to follow the rules by leaving out any reference of parting.
