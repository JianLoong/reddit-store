It was removed, but anyway\u2026Since then we talked and agreed we both treated each other poorly and would make it up to each other. We spent time together and were back on good terms. \n\nThe birthday dinner he planned for me was yesterday. This time in advanced, I sent him a list of options of activities I\u2019d like so there would be no ambiguity of what I expected. There were some nice fine dining restaurants, but also cheap options like a trip to Chinatown. I was really looking forward to it. When I asked if I should look nice for it he said yes.\n\nOn the day of, I got ready and looked my best. He ends up showing up over an hour late saying things took longer than expected to get ready. Not only that, he arrived stressed out with an attitude that he says because he was running late. He put a couple of unwrapped gifts (patio decor) on top of his car for me which were nice. I thanked him. \n\nHowever, it was hard to get past his attitude. He also went on about how everything he tried to book was all booked up. And when we finally got to the restaurant, I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment. It was nothing on my list. It was a decent Mexican restaurant I had been to before, but not anything I had in mind for my milestone birthday. I saw this day as the opportunity to make things right with something I\u2019d love. Instead, I feel like the whole date was really low effort and unimpressive. I felt insulted.\n\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy that dinner. So instead of wasting time, as soon as we were seated, I told him I\u2019d like to go elsewhere and got up and left. He followed me and tried to get me to go walk and talk. It was late, I was hungry and frustrated, and just wanted to go find a place I thought would be more enjoyable to make the most of the remainder of the night. He said he wanted to walk more to calm down, so I said OK and went to the bar of a restaurant on my birthday list. He agreed to meet up later. \n\nI asked him up to the bar for dinner and waited for him, but he refused to join me. I ate by myself. Then he drove me home, got his stuff (I gave him back his gifts while he was at it), and left. He says I\u2019m materialistic and care more about the venue than quality time. I think I have standards, self-respect, and need to stop settling for crumbs. I do not want nor need his money. The date didn\u2019t have to be extravagant, just something special to me. I wanted to feel valued on my special occasion, and that didn\u2019t happen.

Maybe this is really just an issue of not being compatible or him not making you feel loved in general.. but I\u2019m not a fan of people who want to feel \u201ccelebrated\u201d all the damn time .. I\u2019m not saying this to cut you down only to show that not everyone is like you. You wanting to be fawned over and making a big deal out of birthdays \u2026 which I do not consider special would drive me batshit crazy\u2026 I fin hate it\u2019s my birthday month people \u2026 so maybe consider this break up a good thing and find someone who shares your love and passion for celebrating each other in this way\u2026 find a guy just like you\u2026 I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s materialism you\u2019re looking for but love.. but honey you can\u2019t fill that hole this way.

Good riddance to incompatibility.. find a dude who speaks your love language", "I think you both behaved a bit off and both had reasons to be frustrated. \n\nYou have every right to be annoyed/saddened by his minimal effort. But to walk out of the restaurant? That was petty. \n\nInstead, you should have communicated your feelings about his attitude and his dinner choice. Then asked if you could start the night over with a clean slate.", "You sent him a list of places you wanted to go? Like a child writing to Santa. Maybe he wanted to plan things himself!\n\nYou stating that \"it's my milestone birthday\" says it all for me.. Grow up.. It's not that important.\n\nYTA... Walking out of the place he chose, giving him a list of places he had to choose from.. Smh", "ESH\n\nI understand wanting something sweet for a birthday or anniversary etc. It does help when your partner actively thinks of what you will like. This restaurant may not have been on your \"birthday list\" but you clearly have talked about it before and he remembered it as a place you wanted to try/a place you liked. \n\nHe clearly made the effort to try and do something you may enjoy even if he couldn't get into a fine dining place. Maybe if you want a specific thing, you should plan it yourself or perhaps be more realistic in your requests. I know the fine dining around here usually has a wait-list, so he literally may not have been able to get you a fancier place. \n\nHe is accurate in that you are materialistic if you throw a fit over a restaurant to this degree without asking for more info from him. Did he try to get reservations elsewhere? What what he planning that was frustrating? It isn't appropriate to have an attitude but you don't need to match fire with fire.\n\nHe potentially could have done better to plan, but you also could do better to not be completely ungrateful when he clearly just wanted to spend time with you and made an effort to get you something you wanted. If you want specific, plan it yourself otherwise don't take it out on your partner for not understanding your different \"lists\". Personally, this relationship sounds exhausting on both ends and if couples therapy isn't taken into consideration then I doubt this relationship will last.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
