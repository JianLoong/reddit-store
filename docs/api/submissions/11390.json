Her name is Ashley. Even though we were careful she ended up getting pregnant. We thought that it would be easier to coparent while our baby was young if we lived together. So the plan was for her to move in with me since I have a house and Ashley just has a one bedroom apartment. Ashley also has a 8 year old son who would be moving in as well. It was made clear this was as a coparent thing, not as a romantic relationship as we were not in one so Ashley and I would have separate bedrooms.\n\nAfter we decided this I came around her place more often to help out with things. I also met her son. We would go to doctor appointments and shop for baby things together. I'd say in the process we became friends.\n\nAshley ended up having a miscarriage. It\u2019s been a little over a week since it happened. Ashley doesn\u2019t have many friends or family so I have been over once a day to bring by food and check in on her. Earlier today when I stopped by her son brought up moving. He has been very excited about the move because he was going to get his own room. Ashley went along with it and made it seem like we were all still going to move in together. He then left for school. With him gone I talked to Ashley about it and told her I didn\u2019t think it would be a good idea for us to move in together anymore.\n\nAshley is now upset and says I blindsided her. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s fair though since she wasn\u2019t expecting to move in for another month and all her stuff was still at her place. A lot of stuff was packed up in boxes, but I offered to help her unpack. She also didn\u2019t tell her landlord yet as she wanted to wait until the last minute. So she still has a place to live. \n\nAm I in the wrong here to think moving in together should be off the table now?", "created_utc": 1677866224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11h8v1l/aita_for_not_letting_friend_move_in_with_me_after/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At a minimum, that will be a ton of drama if you want to date other women, even though ostensibly, it's a strictly roommate relationship.\n\nIt's not her fault, either, but she's definitely an AH since **the entire reason** she would be moving in is to coparent your baby.  And with her miscarriage, there's no reason for her to move.\n\nYou did the right thing to tell her as soon as possible, precisely to avoid her having nowhere to live.\n\nIt sounds like she was really looking for a daddy for her 8 year old son.", "NTA.  Sometimes life does not go as planned.  As there is no longer a reason to cohabitate, you should not.  Cohabitating would just make it more difficult for both of you to meet and form a relationship with someone who is right for you.  She may have seen this as an opportunity for something more, and so she is understandably upset.  Still does not make you an AH.", "I'm honestly confused as to why she would think you all would still move in together. I'm truly sorry about the miscarriage but there's no need to live together for co-parenting. It would be different if she had already given up her apartment.

Sorry for your loss but the plan was for you co-parent in the home together. There is now no longer a need for her to move in with you.", "NTA. You sound as though you did everything to be a responsible and involved parent, but if you both accepted that it wasn't a romantic relationship, sadly there is no commitment for you to make anymore. It's sad for the kid, but he does still have a home.", "NTA, she was only moving in because of the pregnancy, it was going to be a strictly platonic arrangement so that you could both effectivly coparent the child. Why would she still assume she was moving in when there was no longer a baby to coparent? Im sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "NTA. Sad situation, but if you aren't wanting any sort of romantic relationship, why would she be moving in now? There's not really a tactful way to discuss it at this time though sonits just awkward. I would caution you that maybe she thinks you guys are a couple even if you feel you have expressed that you aren't.", "NTA This was a plan for Coparenting. Yeah the miscarriage really sucks and she is gonna need some emotional support. I'm not sure you are the one for that. Maybe you are I don't know how good of friends you are. Either way. Do to the circumstances that she will still have her apartment and it will take more effort to move her into your place then to let her stay in her apartment. This is probably the best call. Since you two agreed on it not being a romantic thing.\n\nEasier not to mix into a cohabitation if there is no benefit.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a difficult situation you're in, and you made those agreements about living arrangements based soley on raising a child. The situation has unfortunately changed, and no longer requires the co-parenting you mentioned.\n\nGood on you for stepping up when you thought there was going to be a child, and for checking up on her after the miscarriage.", "NTA and maybe gently remind her that she\u2019s not the only one that lost the baby.  And let her know you didn\u2019t mean to blindside her but you also have things to process here.", "Clear NTA.", "NTA - no one benefits from this move. I\u2019d argue it was a bad idea even when there was a baby involved.\n\nIf you are no longer romantically involved, she\u2019s going to get pretty upset when you bring other women home or you\u2019d be upset when she brings men home.", "NTA.  If you aren't coparenting any more, there's no reason for her to expect that you would still be living together, especially since she has a place to live.  If she had already alerted her landlord, it would definitely be a different story.", "NTA a baby is no longer in the picture so she no longer has to move in with you.", "NTA. The only reason you suggested moving in together was because she was pregnant. Now she is not. Perhaps she hoped that by moving in you would hopefully have a romantic relationship eventually, which is why she still wanted to move in. But you are NTA to not want to move in w/someone you seem to have little emotional investment in.", "NTA. But make sure you don\u2019t sleep with her again.", "Nope, NTA. She hadn\u2019t told her landlord and you have zero ties to her. If having her and her son move in with you isn\u2019t something you\u2019d do if the pregnancy had not happened, then there\u2019s no reason to have her move in now.\n\nEDIT: Kudos to you for being responsible and setting up a co-parenting situation when you thought there was a child on the way. Also for being there for her after the miscarriage. You are certainly a stand-up guy. No need to be burdened with a roommate and 8year old child though, unless that\u2019s something you want.", "NTA.  The situation is sad, however the need to co-parent is no longer there.", "NTA since you're not the one that brought it up. You're not in a relationship and now there is no baby to co-parent. I'm sorry for you both for your loss, but you're NTA for not stringing her and her son along.", "NTA\n\nSince the miscarriage happened a week ago, I would make sure she's okay throughout the day especially since she already has a son. \n\nSee how she's doing mentally and emotionally.", "NTA for choosing to not allow her to move in with you.\n\nYTA for how you presented this to her as a fait accompli. You did blindside her. You had an agreement, yes, based on coparenting. The coparenting no longer being a thing, her moving in no longer makes sense. But you should have had a discussion why you believe her moving in is no longer a good idea.", "NTA.\n\nTo be honest, it was probably a bad idea to begin with, but now it is definitely off the table.  \n\nI don't think she's going to be friendly with you anymore...", "You\u2019re both TA for messing up this little kid\u2019s life and almost messing up another one\u2019s. Get a vasectomy or wear two rubbers from now on.", "It was originally about the kid you and her were having, miscarriages are hard. I know people who have dealt with them, but it sounds like she honestly doesn't care much, she isn't grieving or anything, she just wants someone to be the dad to her kid.", "This is a sad situation but NAH, she\u2019s likely to be an emotional state and probably had built expectations and changed her life accordingly. You were doing this for the kid you would have together and obviously have no obligation to continue with it. Sometimes life just sucks", "NTA you don't even consider her your girlfriend just a friend, why on earth would her and her son move in with you?", "NTA. You're not in a committed romantic relationship. This was only for the child. Tragic and Unfortunately (my condolences.) the need doesn't exist to co-parent anymore and you don't need a roommate. You're not being unreasonable.", "NTA, there really isn't a point to move in together anymore. It sucks you both lost your baby, and now there's a lot to deal with because of the miscarriage, but it seems there is no reason to continue with the move.", "NTA. I\u2019d say just be kind but firm in your conversations with her. There\u2019s no baby to co-parent so why would she still think living together is a good option? Maybe she had hopes of something more romantic happening?", "NTA - The reason you were going to move in together is no longer a reason. You seem like a good person for helping her out and checking up on her but you have no other obligation to her from now on unless you want to as a friend.", "NTA you made a plan if you were both going to be parents. Unfortunately that didn\u2019t happen. Why would she still expect to move in with you if there was no baby?", "Wait wait wait this was an arrangement to co-parent, she lost the baby and still thought she was moving in? Wow.. Sounds like someone was looking for a free ride.. maybe you need to call and check on her and stop going over .. after you both explain to her son that they won\u2019t be moving in with you . You don\u2019t want her to just paint you in a bad light to this child.. he\u2019s old enough to comprehend what\u2019s going on.", "**NTA.**\n\nAs long as it was crystal clear the whole deal was for co-parenting I think you're fine. It's a shitty situation and she deserves empathy, but that's also typically why these types of situations are between two people who are in a relationship.", "No. I mentioned in my OP that she hadn't told her landlord yet.", "I've heard that using two condoms make them ineffective.", "No, she definitely is upset about it it. She's been pretty depressed. That's why I've been going over to check in.", "Correct, never do that. It massively increases their chance of breaking.\n\nThe correct answer is to keep your eye on your condom to ensure it hasn't broken. This can be hard in the heat of the moment but is important.", "You'll end up losing one and fist fishing is fun for no one unless ya into that", "Yep. Use three instead", "I was being facetious but good to know.", "I\u2019d say NAH. I guess you could have talked sooner. What would happen if baby was stillborn and she was already moved in, what if the child passed a year later because of SIDS or other ailments? I get what your plan was but I don\u2019t think it was talked about enough in case of tragic events. I\u2019m sorry you lost your baby, and I\u2019m sorry you were in an awkward situation, but this wasn\u2019t a good plan from the start. Maybe moving her closer would have been ok but moving in together, with another child in the mix, when not in a romantic relationship, was not a good move."]}
