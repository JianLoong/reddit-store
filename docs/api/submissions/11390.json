Sorry for your loss but the plan was for you co-parent in the home together. There is now no longer a need for her to move in with you.", "NTA. You sound as though you did everything to be a responsible and involved parent, but if you both accepted that it wasn't a romantic relationship, sadly there is no commitment for you to make anymore. It's sad for the kid, but he does still have a home.", "NTA, she was only moving in because of the pregnancy, it was going to be a strictly platonic arrangement so that you could both effectivly coparent the child. Why would she still assume she was moving in when there was no longer a baby to coparent? Im sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "NTA. Sad situation, but if you aren't wanting any sort of romantic relationship, why would she be moving in now? There's not really a tactful way to discuss it at this time though sonits just awkward. I would caution you that maybe she thinks you guys are a couple even if you feel you have expressed that you aren't.", "NTA This was a plan for Coparenting. Yeah the miscarriage really sucks and she is gonna need some emotional support. I'm not sure you are the one for that. Maybe you are I don't know how good of friends you are. Either way. Do to the circumstances that she will still have her apartment and it will take more effort to move her into your place then to let her stay in her apartment. This is probably the best call. Since you two agreed on it not being a romantic thing.\n\nEasier not to mix into a cohabitation if there is no benefit.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a difficult situation you're in, and you made those agreements about living arrangements based soley on raising a child. The situation has unfortunately changed, and no longer requires the co-parenting you mentioned.\n\nGood on you for stepping up when you thought there was going to be a child, and for checking up on her after the miscarriage.", "NTA and maybe gently remind her that she\u2019s not the only one that lost the baby.  And let her know you didn\u2019t mean to blindside her but you also have things to process here.", "Clear NTA.", "NTA - no one benefits from this move. I\u2019d argue it was a bad idea even when there was a baby involved.\n\nIf you are no longer romantically involved, she\u2019s going to get pretty upset when you bring other women home or you\u2019d be upset when she brings men home.", "NTA.  If you aren't coparenting any more, there's no reason for her to expect that you would still be living together, especially since she has a place to live.  If she had already alerted her landlord, it would definitely be a different story.", "NTA a baby is no longer in the picture so she no longer has to move in with you.", "NTA. The only reason you suggested moving in together was because she was pregnant. Now she is not. Perhaps she hoped that by moving in you would hopefully have a romantic relationship eventually, which is why she still wanted to move in. But you are NTA to not want to move in w/someone you seem to have little emotional investment in.", "NTA. But make sure you don\u2019t sleep with her again.", "Nope, NTA. She hadn\u2019t told her landlord and you have zero ties to her. If having her and her son move in with you isn\u2019t something you\u2019d do if the pregnancy had not happened, then there\u2019s no reason to have her move in now.\n\nEDIT: Kudos to you for being responsible and setting up a co-parenting situation when you thought there was a child on the way. Also for being there for her after the miscarriage. You are certainly a stand-up guy. No need to be burdened with a roommate and 8year old child though, unless that\u2019s something you want.", "NTA.  The situation is sad, however the need to co-parent is no longer there.", "NTA since you're not the one that brought it up. You're not in a relationship and now there is no baby to co-parent. I'm sorry for you both for your loss, but you're NTA for not stringing her and her son along.", "NTA\n\nSince the miscarriage happened a week ago, I would make sure she's okay throughout the day especially since she already has a son. \n\nSee how she's doing mentally and emotionally.", "NTA for choosing to not allow her to move in with you.\n\nYTA for how you presented this to her as a fait accompli. You did blindside her. You had an agreement, yes, based on coparenting. The coparenting no longer being a thing, her moving in no longer makes sense. But you should have had a discussion why you believe her moving in is no longer a good idea.", "NTA.\n\nTo be honest, it was probably a bad idea to begin with, but now it is definitely off the table.  \n\nI don't think she's going to be friendly with you anymore...", "You\u2019re both TA for messing up this little kid\u2019s life and almost messing up another one\u2019s. Get a vasectomy or wear two rubbers from now on.", "It was originally about the kid you and her were having, miscarriages are hard. I know people who have dealt with them, but it sounds like she honestly doesn't care much, she isn't grieving or anything, she just wants someone to be the dad to her kid.", "This is a sad situation but NAH, she\u2019s likely to be an emotional state and probably had built expectations and changed her life accordingly. You were doing this for the kid you would have together and obviously have no obligation to continue with it. Sometimes life just sucks", "NTA you don't even consider her your girlfriend just a friend, why on earth would her and her son move in with you?", "NTA. You're not in a committed romantic relationship. This was only for the child. Tragic and Unfortunately (my condolences.) the need doesn't exist to co-parent anymore and you don't need a roommate. You're not being unreasonable.", "NTA, there really isn't a point to move in together anymore. It sucks you both lost your baby, and now there's a lot to deal with because of the miscarriage, but it seems there is no reason to continue with the move.", "NTA. I\u2019d say just be kind but firm in your conversations with her. There\u2019s no baby to co-parent so why would she still think living together is a good option? Maybe she had hopes of something more romantic happening?", "NTA - The reason you were going to move in together is no longer a reason. You seem like a good person for helping her out and checking up on her but you have no other obligation to her from now on unless you want to as a friend.", "NTA you made a plan if you were both going to be parents. Unfortunately that didn\u2019t happen. Why would she still expect to move in with you if there was no baby?", "Wait wait wait this was an arrangement to co-parent, she lost the baby and still thought she was moving in? Wow.. Sounds like someone was looking for a free ride.. maybe you need to call and check on her and stop going over .. after you both explain to her son that they won\u2019t be moving in with you . You don\u2019t want her to just paint you in a bad light to this child.. he\u2019s old enough to comprehend what\u2019s going on.", "**NTA.**\n\nAs long as it was crystal clear the whole deal was for co-parenting I think you're fine. It's a shitty situation and she deserves empathy, but that's also typically why these types of situations are between two people who are in a relationship.", "No. I mentioned in my OP that she hadn't told her landlord yet.", "I've heard that using two condoms make them ineffective.", "No, she definitely is upset about it it. She's been pretty depressed. That's why I've been going over to check in.", "Correct, never do that. It massively increases their chance of breaking.\n\nThe correct answer is to keep your eye on your condom to ensure it hasn't broken. This can be hard in the heat of the moment but is important.", "You'll end up losing one and fist fishing is fun for no one unless ya into that", "Yep. Use three instead", "I was being facetious but good to know.", "I\u2019d say NAH. I guess you could have talked sooner. What would happen if baby was stillborn and she was already moved in, what if the child passed a year later because of SIDS or other ailments? I get what your plan was but I don\u2019t think it was talked about enough in case of tragic events. I\u2019m sorry you lost your baby, and I\u2019m sorry you were in an awkward situation, but this wasn\u2019t a good plan from the start. Maybe moving her closer would have been ok but moving in together, with another child in the mix, when not in a romantic relationship, was not a good move.", "I think since sadly the baby is no longer a factor, you moving in together would be a mistake, as you said it was only a sexual type thing, not a relationship, will go nowhere, not fair on the 8 yr old either, I would not want to be moving in with someone unless we were in it for the right reasons.", "She was 22 weeks pregnant. That's 5 months. That sucks. I'm sorry. It's been a week. I can't call her an asshole right now. \n\nShe's not really going to be making rational decisions right now. I agree she shouldn't move in with you but she's grieving the baby and what was going to be a better life for herself and her son. \n\nNAH. You didn't blindside her but she was in one mode and hasn't switched over yet. Maybe she thought because you all became friends you would still want to do that but I understand why you wouldn't and I think you shouldn't let her move in now.", "NAH. Not moving in together anymore because there isn't going to be a baby is a good decision. But it sounds like she thought there was more to this relationship than there is for you.", "NTA. You were going to live together to coparent. That was the only reason. Once she miscarried, there's no reason for her to expect that to happen", "NTA\n\nYou didn't blindside her. She was just banking on moving in with you for the benefits (more space, help with kids, they get their own rooms). You only offered the move because she was going to have your child and the logistics were better. Things change. She'll have to accept that. You're perfectly within your rights to rescind the move in offer now that the reason for it is no longer pertinent. I'm sorry about the loss nonetheless.", "NTA. And I want to double check, though I think you were in the room with her at the doctor,  so that would confirm it...you're *sure* she was pregnant?", "NTA but I'm a little concerned that Ashley thought it was appropriate to move herself and HER SON into your place, considering you were just a hookup, not even friends then, and you hadn't even really met her son until the decision to move in was made.  None of this was appropriate - you could have co-parented from 2 residences, as millions of people do.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, but agree fully that there's no reason to move in now.  My guess is she had rom com hopes that it would work out between you.", "Info: has she done anything permanent regarding the move? Ending her lease, that kind of thing?", "NTA.\n\nIt's a sad situation, but obviously there is zero reason for her to move in so you can co-parent, when you're not going to BE a parent. \n\nI think she just got caught up in the excitement of it all and was looking forward to new good bigger better things.\n\n\n.", "NTA, she is no longer holding your baby so there's no reason to move in together. If she had given up her lease and didn't have a place to go I'd vote differently but that's not the case. You don't owe her son anything and you shouldn't have to pick up the pieces from her bad decisions(2 different baby daddies and she's not with either romantically)", "NTA, I strongly suggest you cut ties with her. You do not want another unwanted pregnancy.", "NTA, the reason for you all moving in together was because of the baby. Unfortunately the miscarriage changed those plans. \n\nI think uf you let her move in you would have a had time getting her to move out. When will adults learn not to involve children in adult decisions until it is all cut and dried.  This poor 8 yr old will very upset and  confused about not moving now. This is not your fault, his mother will have to explain it to him", "Yeah I agree, though it does make sense that he is the one helping with emotional support since they both just lost the same child, planned or not he was preparing for a major life change and having that rug pulled out from under them it makes sense they would both be looking to each other for support while they figure things out.", ">the plan was for her to move in with me since I have a house and Ashley just has a one bedroom apartment. Ashley also has a 8 year old son who would be moving in as well ... He has been very excited about the move because he was going to get his own room.\n\nI'm guessing that this is a combo of hormones, grief, and the fact that she'd gotten herself and her son excited about moving into a bigger, nicer place. Now she's lost her baby but still has pregnancy hormones, she's lost the opportunity to move out of the small apartment, and she's got to explain to her son why that won't be happening too. I can understand why she'd be upset about the circumstances. \n\nNone of this is OP's fault though and he's done way more to support her than a lot of tinder-hookup baby-daddies would do. He's absolutely not TA though. Depending on \\*how\\* Ashley responded, this might be NAH (If she just hasn't had the bandwidth in the last week of grieving and recovery to think through the next logical steps and she was overwhelmed and sad that's understandable. If she started yelling at OP, calling him names and blaming him for not sticking to plans that have been derailed through no fault of his own then she would be TA).", "Yes, I went to multiple doctor appointments. Also had a paternity test done.", "How far along was the pregnancy given that you\u2019ve been to appointments and shopping etc? The hormonal impact is substantial too.", "22 weeks", "A lot of romantic relationships don\u2019t survive those kinds of losses either, though.  If they discussed things like dating others and perhaps future other families they were more responsible than most people can imagine.", "All miscarriages are losses but I think this is important context for her inability to have her mind around this in just over a week.  I\u2019m sorry.", "I agree. Child loss is really hard on any relationship. I just meant things like this should have been discussed, especiallly since there\u2019s an 8yo involved.", "NTA. You don't need a roommate with a kid, it was obviously so you could be with your newborn. No newborn, no reason to live together. Does she want a relationship? Did she think you were going to be more than friends? Either way, you need to set boundaries, and maybe your friendship has just run its course.", "NTA. The child you were going to coparent unfortunately no longer exists, so there is no reason for the two of you to move in together.", "NTA.  Things change in life.   She is not stranded with no place to live", "Def NTA.", "NAH but I think you should have been prepared to have that discussion. I understand that it makes sense in your brain, but she just had a stillbirth (it's only considered a miscarriage before 20 weeks). She's also spent the last few months preparing to start an entirely new life. I completely understand why you're not moving in together, but it was still going to be jarring no matter what. I hope she's looking for someone to help with her grief.", "NTA. And I am guessing she was either actually forming an attachment or she was looking for free rent. Either way isn\u2019t good. And for future reference, it very rarely works out to coparent living together but separate lives. Often one does get attached and throws a fit when the other continues with their own separate life. I have never seen that work out.", "NAH. This is just a sad situation. To lose a baby at 22 weeks is devastating to say the least. I'm so sorry for all of you. I don't think you blindsided her, I think she just needs a little time to see things clearly.", "NAH. She's still an emotional mess and sometimes cancelling stuff after a death feels like another loss - you're already reeling and then you get another reminder that your whole vision of the future has been changed. She's probably also feeling some kind of way about her abilities as a mom after a miscarriage (a lot of people feel intense guilt or like a failure despute it not being their fault the fetus couldn't grow to term), and realizing she now has to disappoint her surviving kid probably stung.\n\nBut it's still reasonable that if you aren't coparenting, you don't want to live together, and I don't blame you for not bringing it up while she was still bleeding.", ">I'm honestly confused as to why she would think you all would still move in together.\n\nHe's not an asshole, but your confusion is unwarranted. It has just been a week since the miscarriage. She's grieving, her hormones are all over the place and the hasn't had time to process everything. It is not surprising that she hadn't considered things analytically.", "Agreed, but without further info I have to wonder how she \"accidentally\" wound up pregnant - it's possible she planned to use him for childcare and his house.", "I agree, NAH", ">Sounds like someone was looking for a free ride\n\nJesus. She miscarried just a week ago. She's still grieving, her hormones haven't settled, and she hasn't had a chance to look at this objectively.\n\nTo say she's just \"looking for a free ride\" makes you the asshole.", ">after you both explain to her son that they won\u2019t be moving in with you .\n\nWhy would he need to explain it to the kid? \n\n>You don\u2019t want her to just paint you in a bad light to this child..\n\nHow would affect op if she does that? Chances are in a few days/weeks, they won't see each other again", "How did op mess the kid's life? It was his mother's decision to move in with op. And obviously the move makes no sense now since she lost the baby.", "? Why have a discussion? Kid+coparenting=moving in. I hate to say this but, since there is no kid, there is no coparenting so anybody would assume that moving in would also be a no go.", "Just jumping on the top comment- she was 22 weeks. That\u2019s not a miscarriage, that\u2019s a stillbirth. She likely had to labor at the hospital to deliver.", "He messed up the kids life by telling him and his mother that they could move in. He thought he was having his own room and a sibling and and (probably) something close to an intact, real family with a mom and father figure in the house. I\u2019m sure it was devastating to him to have these plans change and neither of the adults in this situation should be so cavalier about making and changing these plans. His mother is ultimately responsible for both ensuring she doesn\u2019t get pregnant and keeping her existing child\u2019s life consistent and stable, but the OP has to be more circumspect about not getting women pregnant if he doesn\u2019t want a baby and roommates. What was he going to do\u2014co-parent while dating other women? With this 8-year-old in the house watching this bizarre  dynamic unfolding? The whole thing was wrong.", ">messed up the kids life by telling him and his mother that they could move in.\n\nHe did it so that they could co parent. She didn't have the place for the baby in her apartment, so he offered a solution. Also, she took the decision too, not just him. \n\n>real family with a mom and father figure in the house\n\nOp and her weren't a couple. I doubt op would've been the kid's dad. \n\n>if he doesn\u2019t want a baby and roommates.\n\nHe wanted the baby, which is why he offered her the roommate position in the first place. But without the baby, it doesn't make sense for them to live together, especially since they're not a couple. \n\n>co-parent while dating other women?\n\nI assume the roommate thing was going to be temporary, until ashley could go back to her job or the baby being old enough to go to kindergarten (which in my country is at 2 years, since maternity leave here is 2 years) \n\n>With this 8-year-old in the house watching this bizarre dynamic unfolding?\n\nI don't think op would've had sex on the couch in everyone's view. They were to live together as friends, not as a couple.", "Fyi, in a lot of places that many weeks along would mean she had a stillbirth. It's semantics, but there is a significant emotional and physical difference between the two.", "Was gonna vote N-T-A but with the info added i'm going with NAH cause I know she's going thru it right now. 22 weeks that's a stillborn.", "I\u2019m not going to argue with you. If you don\u2019t like my opinion I don\u2019t mind.", "Your opinion makes no sense. Op is a stand up guy who wanted to help the mother of his child , but there is no reason for them to move in together anymore. What do you want him to do??
