And her 1950's attitude to male versus female roles is laughable.  And to refuse to sit down is confusing.\n\nShe needed to hear your feedback and hopefully she really  hears you.  Good luck", "NTA. I had the feeling I was reading a 1970's sitcom. She is completely out of touch with human interaction but it's not intended. And the fact that your conversation was in private, tells me there was NAH, just a weird situation alltogether.", "NTA. What an embarrassing situation.", "NTA.\n\nThia sounds extremely toxic and controlling.\n\nYou have every right to set boundaries and enforce them regardless of her feelings. She needs to understand that her perspective isn\u2018t the only one and that you\u2019re allowed to live your life without her extreme cuddling.", "NTA. Your mother sounds insufferable. If she wants to be around you in a public setting, she'll just have to learn how to behave like a \"normal\" adult. Whatever that is, when it is at home.", "NTA My son asked me at 13 to stop calling him hon and babe. I still slipped for about six months afterward, but I stopped. Unfortunately, you really should have done this years ago. My son felt a bit infantilized by those terms when puberty \"came a callin\", and he recognized and voiced his discomfort to me and politely asked me to stop. How long have YOU felt this discomfort with your mom? \n\nUnfortunately the onus IS on you to CREATE boundaries. It is HER responsibility as an adult to ACCEPT them. She is behaving rather immaturely with the whole \"I\"ll never do xyz again....I''m your mother...guilt inducing speech etc\". However,  she feels hurt, and that maybe her defense mechanism to go to guilt tactics, it is not uncommon AT ALL. Unfortunately, it's also unhealthy as well. \n\nLet her calm down, take her to lunch, or maybe have her to yours for lunch WITHOUT OTHERS there and calmly have a discussion about boundaries. (Don't do it on \"her\" turf\",  a neutral location is best, because you feel more child like at her home that you grew up in) If it helps, go to a few family therapist channels on youtube and watch a few videos on setting boundaries with well meaning but overbearing parental figures, that should help give you ways and tools to approach it. Above all, REHEARSE what you want to say many, MANY times! I really hate confrontation and talking about things with difficult/ strong personalities, so I totally got around my discomfort by rehearsing...like a hundred times. I imagine ALL THEIR possible responses and have a counter to them all -easy with a family member for the most part. I rehearse so much that it almost comes out naturally, there is still that initial hump to start talking, but then it comes. If they change the subject, I ignore the deflection and counter with pertinent facts regarding THIS is what we are talking about. It GETS EASIER the more you do it. Setting boundaries is a reasonable request that has become a \"battle\" that you've chosen, use these tips and they will help you be heard and succeed. Choose your battles and rehearse them is the best advice I can give.", "NTA because of two main points.\n\n>\t\u201cdon\u2019t worry you\u2019ll never get affection from me ever again.\u201d\n\nThis is an extremely childish response and not taking your (valid) point seriously at all.\n\n>\tshe was taught as a woman that it\u2019s a woman\u2019s job to take care of her man, and when my fiance doesn\u2019t she (my mom) wants to step in and help\n\nPutting the slightly archaic view aside, this is insulting to your fiance and clearly implying that they don't take proper care of you (or else your mum wouldn't have to step in).", "**NAH**, you\u2019re in the right for privately pointing out the behavior you want her to change, but I\u2019m also going to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that they way you put it across hurt her when all she was trying to do was probably to show her affection to you and fit in. Getting told she wasn\u2019t really doing either of those things as well as she wanted or thought is going to hurt.\n\nIf you wanted my advice I\u2019d tell you to approach her again later, probably with an apology about how it came across, then try to nonconfrontionally explain the issue before wrapping up by assuring her you love and appreciate her. Kind of a good news/bad news/good news sandwich.", "This is interesting but I'm gonna go NAH. You have the right to body autonomy and if you don't want to be touched then smy/you shouldn't be touched but saying you don't want her to say something like you got this sweetie is going a little far.", "It sounds a little emotionally\u2026incesty\u2026 has she always been like this with you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
