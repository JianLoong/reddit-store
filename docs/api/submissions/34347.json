Her name is Hannah and she is a beautiful, brilliant girl. The only issue I have is that she respects zero boundaries. I have half a mind to say she acts slightly entitled (ie: if you tell her no, it's met with a \"actually you're going to say yes because I'm a princess\" and she laughs when she says it so I think she's joking but she's actually serious. When she realizes you won't budge, she stomps off to her room and rolls her eyes at you and gives you the silent treatment). Other than this, she's a gem.\n\nWell, a little over two weeks ago a lot of my state flooded (Maine, if you're interested). The first floor of our home was filled with water, as we were right beside the river. Everything upstairs was untouched but everything downstairs (living room, nursery, my bedroom, kitchen) was destroyed. By the time we were able to go see our home, the amount of black mold already growing was ridiculous. My step daughters room was upstairs so she didn't lose anything. My husband and I had to start from scratch on all of our clothing and our 3 month old daughters clothing. And given that we were just blowing so much money on a hotel, we were more broke than we ever had been. We reached out to local churches and thankfully we were given a small bag of clothes and diaper help for our daughter but my husband and I have been hand washing the 2 sets of clothes we have for ourselves. Insurance hasn't kicked in yet but we did finally get a voucher provided by the state for our hotel stay and food so we are slowly starting to get better financially.\n\nWell, ever since we got that small bag of clothes from the church (4 outfits and 2 onesies) my step daughter has been taking those clothes and putting them on her dolls/stuffed animals despite us telling her to stop. And then today (after literally 8-10 discussions) I found that she had actually cut up one of the onesies to fit her teddy bear better. I lost it. I told her she was selfish and inconsiderate. That she didn't take the time to listen to her father and I or our reasoning and that she's knowingly destroying her sisters needed items for her own gain. She immediately started crying and slammed the door. I DID apologize. Absolutely. She's a fucking kid and I just lost my shit out of anger. But I told my husband because I felt like a POS and he said he will never forgive me. He told me to go stay with my mom for awhile (out of state) while he figures stuff out for him and his daughter because I'm \"unsafe\" to be around. AITA?\n\nETA: the events in my post are 100% what happened. There's no other hidden happenings. I think this was 100% a stress induced outburst on his part because he lost everything in the flood (his brothers urn, his mom's paintings, his guitars, gaming consoles, $8k+ in electronics, etc) but I didn't have much to lose outside of clothing and my drawings. He had just yelled at her 3 days prior for taking the babies diapers and using them on her dolls, so he's by no means perfect and should have understood my frustrations but he says he's allowed to lash out, I'm not. He said it makes him not trust me around his kid. But no, nothing else happened. He wouldn't have even known if I hadn't told him because my step daughter had forgotten all about it by the time he had gotten home and her and I were watching TV together. Again, I did apologize to her before I even told her dad what happened.", "created_utc": 1704403843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yojae/aita_for_making_my_step_daughter_cry_over_clothes/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In a comment you added: **He yelled at her 3 nights ago for something similar (she took the babies diapers and put them on her dolls) and that was okay. But since it was me and I did it, it's not okay.** THIS and his lack of discipline when SD has tantrums is WHY she has tantrums. She's been given the go-ahead by dear old dad and also is being schooled that what your voice doesn't matter. If he thinks daughter is unsafe around you because you reacted EXACTLY the same way that he did, the writing is on the wall. This stressful event has revealed a truth and that is: your hubby doesn't value you or trust you and is teaching his daughter the same. I'd counter that SD needs to spend time outside the family home with her SM or other relatives while the 2 of you sort this out, if it can be sorted. Sounds like the tip of an iceberg!", "Nta.\n\nJust because she cried doesn't mean she did anything wrong. You said yourself that if she doesn't get her way she storms off and throws a fit.

This fully falls under the second category", "NTA or ESH depending on how badly you lost it on her.

Calling her selfish and inconsiderate was bang on. 12 years old is well old enough not to do shit like this - this was a deliberate action on her part.

It's cute when you're 5. Not so much when you're a teen/ young adult. At her age, she is old enough to understand when she has done something wrong and why someone might be upset at her when she does.  \nHonestly, I don't think your reaction was all that unreasonable, given what you're going through as a family. Sure, in an ideal world you wouldn't have yelled at your step-daughter, but you are going through a LOT right now. To suggest that she is somehow \"unsafe\" around you, simply because you raised your voice is ridiculous. Especially since you stated that he has yelled at her for the same thing. If she is unsafe around you because you yelled, he should hold himself to the same standard.\n\nHas either of you tried explaining to her why you were upset? She's absolutely old enough to get it. I mean, apologize for raising your voice, if you feel you should. But, at the same time, she should understand how her behavior upset you.", "Sorry for everything you're going through. I don't think what you did was wrong.", "As someone who has been through flooding three times(once in winter too), it is never easy and it's disconcerting in a way people who haven't never comprehend.\n\nYour husband IS stressed, BUT shit happens.  When you live next to a river, especially these days, you EXPECT the river to win on occasion, and to win big.\n\nNTA.  Perhaps it IS time to go see your mother and weigh the pros and cons of your relationship.  Write it down if you have to.  Be brutal in your honesty with yourself.  If you think it's worth saving(and it might be) then its long past time to sit him down and have an involved talk about your future together.  Depending on his responses, go from there.\n\nThe flooding stuff will take time to recover from, but do not let that get in the way of having this conversation.  It needs to happen, NOW.  The flooding crap is gonna be there in one form or other for 18 months minimum. \n\nGood luck OP.  Fingers crossed for your future, however it works out.", "Was it like crazy yelling or just talking at her loudly?\n\nI know the internet (especially reddit) doesn't like yelling but I think in this case it's warranted as long as you weren't mean or overly aggressive. It sounds like step daughter has a pattern of behaving like this. You said it yourself she acts entitled outside of this one incident and throws a fit when she doesn't get her way. This is just another one of those times. \n\nSome how she has to learn that she can't just take stuff that isn't her ls, especially in this situation where you can't just go get more clothes for the baby. \n\nYou did not overreact, she she your husband did.", "NTA. Go to ur mom's house with ur baby. See if he can take care of his princess on his own.", "Decide what he wants? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Are you kidding me? Did he actually say that!? That\u2019s so wrong!! \nNTA", "Well this just sounds like something else us going on in his head.  It can't be just that!", "My step daughters mom has never been in the picture. She wanted an abortion, my husband didn't. So she gave birth and signed off her rights. She does call my husband's ex \"mom\", though she knows it's not her real mom and sees her maybe once a month. Our relationship with all of us was great prior to the flooding. My husband lost literally everything. His brothers urn was smashed, his late mom's paintings were all destroyed, his guitars (17 of all shapes and sizes) were all destroyed (one of which was also his brothers). So my husband has been super hard to get along with and we walk on eggshells. He just yelled at his daughter 3 nights prior because she was taking the babies diapers and putting them on her dolls. So he freaked out and it was okay. I yell and I'm a demon, basically. But I truly think it's all stress. He's usually not like this. I'm certainly not like this. But yes, he expects me to take our daughter and leave. I breastfeed so he would never try to keep her.", "I don't have kids either but I think this is a very child specific thing. I'm in my 40s and my friend group and I were absolutely no longer playing with dolls at 12. My cousin who is about 15 years younger was playing with dolls at that age. Her daughter who is about to turn 12 in a couple months hasn't played with dolls in a while.", "She should still know better at 12 than use her baby sister\u2019s limited clothes after a flood & diapers to play with!", "He only sees it like that when it's... convenient? Unsure if I explained that properly. Idk. She calls my husband's ex \"mom\". She knows that she isn't her real mom but she still sees her once a month usually. Her real mom signed her away at birth. She wanted an abortion, my husband didn't, so she carried her for my husband and signed away her rights.", "Tell that to Cinderella.", "I did explain to her why I yelled and she said she didn't understand because I could still use the clothes and I could still use the diapers because she wasnt dirtying them.", "Talking loudly. I wasn't screaming but my voice was raised.", "It's concerning that he would want you to take the baby and leave, without him having any contact with his (younger) daughter. \n\nIt also concerns me that he thinks you're not safe to be around your stepdaughter but somehow *are* safe to be around the baby. \n\nStress is the most logical explanation. Have you spoken with him since all of this happened?", "I agree. I commented earlier on the post addressing reasons why the stepdaughter may be behaving this way, particularly if she's feeling displaced by the new baby.", "Honestly I\u2019d leave him to his mould and his kid. He can deal with both the way he likes. You can\u2019t just kick your wife and infant out so casually.", "There is nothing wrong with that in this situation.", "Talking loudly is not yelling and there's nothing unsafe about talking loudly to your step daughter when she's doing something you've told her several times not to do. That's just being a parent. \n\nIt sounds like you simply scolded her, which she needed in that moment, she over reacted and that probably made you think that you were yelling. \n\nYou weren't. You did nothing wrong."]}
