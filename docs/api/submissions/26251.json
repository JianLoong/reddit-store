Staff is 5 females, inc my boss (40f), me (40f) and 3 other shop assistants (all ranging from 20f to 35f). I rarely see the shop assistants as I generally WFH in a website admin role, but obvs have frequent contact with boss lady.\n\nYesterday, boss lady announces it's one of the shop assistants 21st birthday soon. She asked if I was planning to go to her party and had I thought of a gift?\n\nBoss lady then asks if I would like to chip for a group present she bought which the other shop assistants are putting in for also. I said sure, how about $30? Awkward silence. She goes on to explain it's $450 pottery piece and the other 2 girls were putting in $100 each.  Awkward silence.\n\nSide note: It just so happens I'm going away on the weekend of the party so can't attend BUT haven't actually been invited by the birthday girl anyway, so was not attending nor planning on giving a gift (it's a party that she's hosting for friends and family, not a workplace staff organised party).\n\nFurther notes: All the other females inc boss lady don't have kids. I DO and honestly, I'm at a time of my life where with two primary school kids, I feel like I'm spending on a gazillion presents every other week for kids birthday parties, teachers gifts, parent rep gifts, sport coach gifts, music teacher gifts etc... it's out of control! I, along with my crew of bestie girlfriends who are all  in the same boat as me, don't even buy each other gifts anymore, strictly kids only. We just hit the pub for a nice meal and drink instead.\n\nIn my previous workplace which was predominately males, for birthdays, my old boss would take our small group out for lunch, pay for everyone and that was it. Perfect!\n\nI really don't want to get involved in a work merri-go-round of gift giving. I don't want gifts myself (birthday gifts are for kids, for where I'm at in life atm). I'm happy with a high five and wishes for a top day.\n\nAlso, as mentioned, I work there part-time so take home about $500 a week in pay. Boss lady is asking for me to gift a fifth of that back for a staff present, I mean... wtf?\n\nAITA for not wanting to stretch to match $100 for a girl I barely know, who hasn't event invited me to her party? I feel like opting out of the group gift and just getting something small and appropriate for the situation... and that still feels generous!

It's weird that your boss would A) put a budget on a gift without consulting everyone first or B) expect you to pitch in after only being there for 6 months. I don't think you should be pressured into the situation at all but since it's already happened I think your idea about getting something small is perfectly acceptable.IMO, your boss not seeing this is kind of cause for concern.

You\u2019re not obligated and that\u2019s a lot of money for a coworker gift, one that, if I\u2019m understanding correctly, you had zero input on (the gift itself and it\u2019s price point). \nI loathe when someone picks out the (expensive) girt, buys it, and then wants me to pitch in an equal share.

In the old days of fully in-person work,  the correct process would be:  a) pass an envelope around and let people put what cash they want in it-- with no one keeping track of who donates what,  then b) select a gift based on the amount gathered.  Ideally, someone other than the boss should do the collecting to minimize the risk of coercion.\n\nIn the remote-work world, someone usually collects donations by e-transfer (what to you Americans call it?  Venmo?) , politely not noticing who gives what amounts, then the money collector buys the gift.  Optional step in both scenarios:  the money gatherer announces the total amount collected to the group and the group decides on a present.\n\nIn my workplace, your contribution would be more than generous enough.", "100 bucks is a lot. we do this to on every major milestone but everyone gives 5 bucks 10 if they are friends.

Because unless she plans to  settle down in the same town/house for a long time, there's no way she needs a $450 pottery piece to have to take care of whenever she moves. That just sounds like a terrible idea to me, then again, I haven't stopped moving around yet and I'm in my 30s. The longest I've lived in one place since I moved out of home is probably 2 years. Anything I pick up along the way has to be stored at my parent's house until I decide to settle or pay for a storage unit. Now, maybe this 20 yr old does plan to stay, maybe she already collects valuable art pieces, who knows! It could be the perfect gift for her, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't more of a burden at this point in time.\n\nAlso, NTA, $100 as a part-time, WFH, new employee who wasn't even invited to the birthday party?

If it\u2019s small enough that you\u2019d be annoyed but just get on the train and lose the money, just pay it (this is particularly useful for compulsory gifts like this).
