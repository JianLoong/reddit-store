Don't know a single person who finds them remotely entertaining or funny. Have seen a handful of people put them on and not once have I seen them behave like the sort of people I'd want in my life. \n\nThey're typically the sort of people who don't have respect for the people around them. Who think their entertainment is the only thing that matters, irrespective of how it might impact everyone else. You're not exactly proving that wrong.", "You seem pretty pressed about the situation in general bc you had to ask a whole bunch of internet strangers to validate your childish behavior.", "How small is your dick, dude?", "It obviously got to you if you posted it here", "Bit of a stretch here\nI\u2019m wearing a bucket that\u2019s given out for free to fans on entry\nAnd i\u2019m not asking her to roll out a red carpet am i?", "Right and he was in front, no eyes in the back of his head. Like I\u2019ve been saying a simple tap on the shoulder and request to remove the hat would have sufficed from the beginning.", "Because he's a power tripping AH who gets off on women begging him for common decency.", "So be it\nInteresting to see how many people oblige to snide remarks", "Same height. F that. I ain't giving myself more back problems so people can see perfectly.", "I\u2019m sure if the buckets had a direct link to hoon behaviour like you\u2019re suggesting. They\u2019d stamp them out", "Definitely didn\u2019t i really just wanted to hear what others would do & opinions\nI do think i picked the wrong subreddit for that", "You posted this on here, so you can\u2019t control other peoples read of the situation or call it a \u201cstretch\u201d.", "How does \"given out free\" automatically mean acting like an AH to someone sitting behind you? You weren't under orders to wear it.", "Why post here if you already have a set opinion of yourself and just argue with people saying you were a dick?", "I agree. I'm not saying she went about it the right way.\n\nWhat I'm saying is he was clearly causing a problem. She made that fact known. The wrong way, yes, but she made it known. At that point, he should have just apologised, taken the bucket off, and said he'd have appreciated being respectfully asked to remove it. \n\n\"She didn't ask nicely\" isn't a good reason to be a dick.", "Haha wow you took this to another level \ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s got nothing to do with gender.", "You're missing the point.\n\nIt's not about her snide remarks.\n\nIt's about you wearing the stupid hat in the first place knowing it would inevitably obstruct someone's view.\n\nThat's why you're a hypocrite. Because that's terrible manners.\nSure she could have asked you to remove the hat politely be you were acting like a total ass by wearing it.\n\nWhat kind of self observed AH does that?\n\nAh yes you", "I genuinely feel sorry for everyone who knows you in real life.", "Don't  listen to the hypercritsin the forum the just love being able to pile on, and talk about being decent while saying ignorant things on the internet. NTA", "Oh honey bunch. \n\nIn statistics, there's this thing called a correlation. Fun fact about correlations - they don't imply causation. You cannot establish cause and effect from a correlation.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, it means that even if there is a correlation between wearing a fried chicken bucket on your head and hoon behaviour, the bucket wearing didn't cause the behaviour. They're just linked, possibly because of something we call an extraneous variable (big word). \n\nNow, here's where it gets *really* complex. If there was something that was *causing* dangerous behaviour at the Big Bash, they probably would stamp it out! But in this case, the buckets aren't causing the bad behaviour, because we have a *correlation*, so there's no reason to stamp them out. That's why they haven't been banned! \n\nSo what's the link I'm *actually* suggesting? Well, I'm suggesting that hoons have a number of shared traits that probably *increase their likelihood* of wanting to wear a cardboard bucket on their cranium (cranium means skull, which is part of the head). These hoons are your \"larger than life\" sort, but not in the good way. They get drunk, and they think that everyone enjoys their drunkenness. They're loud, and they're obnoxious, and they think the whole world is going to laugh when they're disruptive and overbearing. The whole world doesn't laugh, of course. The whole world hates them. But they don't know that, because they don't see beyond themselves. So they think we all *love* how wild they are. Now. A person with all of *those* traits is probably going to think wearing a *bucket on their head* is the absolute peak of comedy. The peak of entertainment. They think *everyone will love it*. So they do it, and they don't care that maybe the people behind them can't see.", "You quite enjoy being an asshole, don't you?", "Pretty sure you would be an asshole on most subreddits", "HAHAHAHHA no you chose the correct one. You just don\u2019t like our responses. The people responding are from all over the world, all different life experiences and are all telling you that you\u2019re being a jerk. Take the hint.", "You do realise you were both being snide and petty? Just because people think you were an asshole doesn't mean this is the wrong sub it just means people disagree. Yes she could have asked politely but frankly she shouldn't have to, you knew she couldn't see and decided that instead of just resolving everything before it can even become a situation you'll ruin the game until she's polite to you. \n\nIf you took it off there would have been no remarks. You were being just as petty as her, yes she could have just asked and probably should have but it was you who escalated the situation not her. All she was doing was bitching to her friend about the shit behaviour about the dude in front of her whilst you were sat smugly waiting for a polite request.\n\nJust take the hat off so you can both enjoy the game mate.", "She didn\u2019t ask, that\u2019s the point.", "Psh. Downvote all you want. The entitlement drips off of him.", "I don\u2019t not like anyone\u2019s response\nI\u2019m actually taking it all on board\nIt\u2019s super interesting to me how many people reward the snide remarks\nI\u2019d expect all of them to reward snide remarks for the rest of their lives\nI just wont be one of those people"]}
