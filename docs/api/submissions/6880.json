Could you please remove x or please stop y?\"", "Right, that's not how adults act.  Adults would say, \"Oops, sorry\" and move to the side if blocking the sidewalk.  Because to a grown-up, it is more important to not be an inconsiderate prick than to avoid acknowledging that you were an inconsiderate prick.\n\nWhen you do something which hurts another person - including minor annoyance or inconvenience - you take the following actions:\n\n1. Acknowledge wrongdoing to yourself\n2. Work to understand the offense in your own mind and emotions\n3. Work out a way to prevent the offense from happening again\n4. Work to repair the damage the offense caused\n5. Acknowledge the offense to the offended party, express regret, and apologize\n\nObviously, for something like blocking the sidewalk or someone's view, this whole process shouldn't take more than a second or two.  But that very fact is part of why it is important to do the whole thing - it is practice for the times in your life that you screw up in big ways.\n\nAt that point, the offended party has the right to forgive or not forgive you.  For a trivial offense, not repeating the offense is a sufficient response even if not forgiven; for a major offense, you may go back through the entire process up to two more times; if forgiveness isn't forthcoming at that point, you may conclude that further attempts are simply more likely to cause further damage, and you drop it, possibly with going no contact.  And sometimes, the offense is great enough that it is clear that further contact will simply cause more damage in the first place, and you don't even do step 6 at all, but that is for things like sexual assault or killing someone's loved one.\n\nAnd the way in which a person alerts you to the offense is irrelevant to the process.  If their method of alerting you to your offense created an offense on their part, that is a separate issue, essentially unrelated to yours.\n\nThe following processes are independent: your repair and apology, their acceptance and forgiveness, their repair and apology for any role they played in the situation, and your acceptance and forgiveness.\n\nThe point of all of this is that your two choices after being an asshole are to not be an asshole, or continue to be an asshole.  And refusing to acknowledge that you are an asshole necessarily results in your continuing to be an asshole.\n\nIn a case like blocking someone's view with a KFC bucket or blocking the sidewalk by taking the whole thing up, this process can be accomplished with \"oops, sorry,\" while moving to the side/removing the bucket from your head.  And that is the action which you take regardless of whether you were asked politely or you were passive-aggressively snarked at.  Ideally, a person who snarked will respond with an apology of their own, but even if they don't, that's no skin off your nose.
