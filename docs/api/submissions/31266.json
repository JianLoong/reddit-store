I bought this for my nibling many many years ago. The in-laws passive aggressively mocked the gift, but then were dismayed to realize that the big bag full of axles for a boy who loved to build \"trucks\" meant that my gift got played with 100% of the time because they were just being incorporated with the pre-existing LEGOs.\n\nSo, suggest that Zee who really loves building XX could use a component pack of YY. Anything they're really into there's probably some component that they run short of, it's a great way to get to know what's going on in their minds and how they play.  Ask them some questions and I'm sure you'll come up with a component pack that would absolutely delight them, and that would be impossible for their grandparents to pre-assemble.", "Have her and your son sit down and watch The Lego Movie together and then foster a conversation between them about it. Keeping sets intact vs building what you want is the main theme.", "Keep it at her house and let her tell him that he can\u2019t play with it.", "Depending on what set it is\u2026 Taking it a apart seems like more of a hell, lol.", "If it's a big set, that could be thousands of pieces. When you first get then, they are in numbered bags so you I can build in stages.", "Yeah, no. Legos are by far the most played with toy in my household (kids are 8 and 11), and sets never (and I mean never) stay intact. A part of me dismayed at all the beautiful sets we only got to see fully built for a day or two, but the more sensible part of me loves the fact that kid #1 is amazingly creative and that he's found his favorite medium: Lego. He's built so many lovely MOCs and swears that he'll be Lego fan for life; I'm glad that he's found a hobby he gets so more enjoyment from!\n\nSo yeah, Lego are like Play-doh for the spatially gifted among us, rebuilding is the whole point.", "So stop hinting.", "It\u2019s all of it. My husband and grandson build, tear down, and rebuild. When g\u2019son is older and the sets get complex, they\u2019ll build and then display I\u2019m sure, but gpa will be helping as support staff, the main builder will always be g\u2019son. Otherwise it\u2019s not a gift.", "You can get the instructions online or in the Lego app, just need the set #\nAnd also to chime in that the fun of Lego is in the building, helps with dexterity development in younger children too. My son would always lead the build process with help from an adult if he couldn\u2019t find the right piece or understand part of the instructions. Some sets remained complete (Deathstar & Ecto 1), others have been remodelled (Millenium Falcon).", "> I think she envisions the build being used for imaginative play.\n\nBut... But he has a dollhouse!\n\nDoes she not realize that a complex build will break if it's transported in a car? How big is this thing, if it's taking her 6-7 hours to build? Will it even fit in the car?\n\nIt's not the Disney Castle or the Millennium Falcon is it? Please say no.", "I see so many typos where I can only assume that autocorrect changed someone's meaning", "I feel like that would be cute, for me it was proof that the person I was dating was self absorbed and would always put what he wanted over what I wanted. It did not last long after that thankfully!", "Haha I love your kid's creativity!!! I Hope mine will be as imaginative with time. So far, my kid's builds are mostly variations on houses and playgrounds.", "Right \u201che\u2019s so excited to put the Lego set together - it\u2019s his favorite thing right now, thanks for buying him the set!\u201d Act like you don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing", "Yes! They messed up the pre bags so it doesn\u2019t take way longer than it should then you gotta hope you didn\u2019t lose any pieces when taking it apart to put it back together. I\u2019d be livid", "I don't see that working out well. She sounds like the type to ruin the fun for the kid and get in a snit if they don't follow the instructions exactly. Kids should have a big bucket of bricks to build what they want and decide they want to complete a build according to instructions if and when they're ready."]}
