I hope that the child will be allowed to adapt, alter, or invent on the set. However, I frankly fear the disappointment and disdain that the child will face from my MIL upon trying to do so.", "Maybe suggest they work on it together. That way they both get to have the fun and it would be a great grandma grandson bonding activity.", "Holy Fuck, i would be furious, as a kid, if i got a Lego set that was already built. WTF would i want that. That is some serious BS. Your MIL is just evil for doing that to her grandchild\n\nIm sorry but this really triggered me.  Im a huge Lego fan. I have many builds displayed throughout my home. My most recent one im working on is the Titanic build. if you dont know its 9090 Lego pieces. Lego is absolutely about the Build. \n\nNTA and tell her to keep it if she gonna build it.  And if you do take it, make sure she sees you dismantling it so kiddo can do the build. But be sure to get the instruction book.", "I\u2019m absolutely torn between laughing and dying of embarrassment for GM. She is opening and playing with toy before giving it to child to \u2026look at? So if she gave the kid a easy bake oven she would bake all the mixes first and give kid over and completed cakes and say wow that was fun. Would she \u201cgive\u201d you a cruise and take the trip for you? I know you are both flustered how to tell her what she is doing is odd\u2026. But this isn\u2019t the same as putting the bike together before giving it as a gift. She is taking the purpose of the gift away?", "NTA.  That's the weirdest thing I've ever heard of.  She has presumably misunderstood how Lego works so I'd definitely have a conversation with her about it but if she's going to die on the hill of insisting it stay assembled then you're under no obligation to abide by it. The only difficult thing will be managing your kid's expectations about his gift so if you can reach a solution where he gets to dismantle and take home then that's the optimum outcome.", "those are your MIL's Legos. If you gift a kid a Lego set you give them the sealed box and they get to build it. Furthermore once you give someone a gift what they do with it is entirely up to them. NTA", "If your MIL does not accept your explanation of Lego from you, an adult, she is likely going to hear a child\u2019s version of the explanation from your son. He is going to be confused upon receiving this Lego kit. He\u2019s going to ask why it is already put together. That may be the simplest way to solve this problem; let him ask, or prepare her that he is probably going to ask this question.\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "The whole point of \u201cplaying\u201d with Lego is to build it\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s not fun after it\u2019s built.  My son builds legos and then puts them on his father\u2019s bookshelf for viewing, but his enjoyment came from building it.", "She\u2019s likely bought something that\u2019s not age appropriate. My nephew adores building lego but we have to be careful on what sets we get to avoid meltdowns - those age limits can really mean something! Absolutely tell her it can stay there, point out if you move it, it will get broken lol. NTA", "As far as I am aware there are two kinds of legos.  Lego Blocks for imagination play where you create whatever you want.  Then there are the Lego Playsets which are like doll houses made out of Legos.  The sets aren\u2019t exactly as simple as normal Lego blocks because the legos included are custom made specifically for that set. \n\nAn example is the Star Wars Lego sets or Harry Potter sets.  You can\u2019t make a race car out of the pieces for Millennium Falcon or Hogwarts Castle.  \n\n\nSo while your son would be completely fine to destroy an Legos he himself builds.  That wouldn\u2019t be allowed at his friends house.  If he has friends with Lego sets and he does break it apart to play with them he will be wrong to do so.  \n\nWhile NTA for asking to leave it at grandmas house.  Take this as a teaching lesson to teach him about respecting the builds his friends might have made.", "Lego build sets are not actually meant for kids because they are to be displayed HOWEVER my son and I have many and we will break down and reassemble them a lot amd so.etimes improvise a new way to make them. If the MIL wants to give a gift she cannot tell the person receiving the gift how to use it... I say if she wants to tell you what to do with it that's fine but she needs to accept it is not hers and you'll do as you need and want once it's in your home!", "nta. if she keeps moaning, go to her house, sans kid, ask her to get the box, and then break the legos apart and put them in the box so you can bring them home. if she acts shocked, act like you have no idea what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cyou said they were for kid, right? i won\u2019t tell kid you played with it first, don\u2019t worry. we don\u2019t mind used gifts.\u201d", "NTA", "NTA lego is for building as well as playing.

Probably due to the fact that I didn't get the joy of learning how to create it myself.", "OP,\n\nSpeak plainly.\n\n*MIL, the kids are now old enough to enjoy putting Legos and other kits together... and doing it their way and maybe rearranging things a few times. If you would enjoy building the kits together with the kids, with all the chaos that can entail, please plan to do that. I think you all would have a great time! If you prefer to let them have at it on their own, then please just give them the sets still boxed up.

With the additional request of only displaying it in a certain way and apparently not even letting them play with it, MIL is basically taking away everything that makes LEGOs fun for kids.", "That kind of makes it MIL's Lego and not the kid's Lego.", "Yeah, of course these themed sets are developed to have all the pieces for whatever they're supposed to be, but nobody forces you to built that. I mean, my kid built a pretty cool spaceship out of a lego farmhouse playset yesterday. No lego police showed up! Cow was piloting and all. That's what creativity is all about!", "Don\u2019t hint, tell her your kid likes to build the Lego whatever and would rather do it themselves.", "You need to stop hinting and just tell her that you appreciate her hard work, but that your kid will probably be a little disappointed if he doesn\u2019t at least get to build it with grandma. And then I would just say like, \u201cJoey loves Legos but he usually assembles the sets and then later takes them apart to build different things or rebuild the sets. If it\u2019s important to you that this set stays intact, I\u2019d like to leave it here at your house, as I worry the temptation for him to take it apart will be too much, and I wouldn\u2019t want you to be upset.\u201d", "Be a butter fingers and drop it on the cement outside on the way to the car when you leave. Pick up all the pieces, then tell your kid you\u2019ll just have to rebuild it at home.", "Don\u2019t hint. Be blunt. They only like legos if they can build it. If you build it for them we will not accept the gift.", "Stop hinting. You/dh should have said something the moment she said she was setting it up, but better late than never. \n\nSay/text \u201cMIL, dh mentioned to me that you bought son a Lego set! He will love that! I was a little confused though because he told me that you were spending a lot of time getting it ready for him, and it just occurred to me that I might need to clarify that the fun for him is in building the set, not just having it assembled. Please don\u2019t build it yourself if it\u2019s meant to be a gift for him. Thanks!\u201d\n\nEdited because I saw op say in a different comment that mil has been telling dh, not her", "this is a great analogy. I love Lego but absolutely hate puzzles. So if Somone gave me an already assembled puzzle i would thank them. But if someone gave me a pre built Lego i would go nuts.", "Hahaha! Love the analogy! I'd been trying to think of an appropriate one!", "Does he really want to see his kid disappointed like that? For a lot of kids, the fun of Lego is completely about the building of it. \n\nIt will also mean that your kid may start to distrust or even dislike their grandma for taking that away from them. Is that the outcome he (or the mil) wants? I\u2019m guessing the answer is no. I would encourage your husband to look at it that way and to stick up for their kid.", "If she is considering the construction  such an imposition, surely it\u2019s kinder for your husband to put her right? NTA", "I think at least 90% of the fun of Legos is the assembly.\n\nIt's one thing to assemble, say, a bike for the kid. Assembling the Legos is playing with the Legos. As someone else said, it's like pre-assembling a jigsaw puzzle. What a lame gift!", "My 5 year old requests that I put all his builds on display on high shelves.", "Absolutely!
