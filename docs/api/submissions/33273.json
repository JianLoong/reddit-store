{"id": 33273, "submission_id": "18l45y2", "title": "WIBTA if I Talked my Husband Out of a Trip He would be Invited to?", "selftext": "\nMy (28F) husband (30M) is a very picky eater. He doesn\u2019t eat seafood at all. We make it work when going to restaurants and trips by ordering one dish each and I have long ago stopped encouraging him to try new dishes. \n\nIt has been one of my dreams to go to Japan and eat as many dishes as I can. My mom, dad and younger sister are going and have extended an invite to me. They know about my husband\u2019s eating habits and said they would be polite enough to extend him an invite as well but wanted me to sort this out with him. \n\nNow, as hard as it may seem, as my partner I would be ecstatic if he partakes in the same activities as we do in Japan, but we all know he wouldn\u2019t be able to order a decent dish at a regular sushi place in Japan. Plus his aversion to seafood kills any reason to eat out. It would severely limit our own enjoyment as well if he joined us. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be one of those AH partners who don\u2019t invite their SO with them. But it\u2019s difficult to navigate this situation. Should I just say no to my parents as well? \n\nMy parents and I, absolutely do not want to compromise on our meals. However, I also don\u2019t want him to get like a meal from 7/11 only to stare at an empty plate at an upscale place as we eat ourselves. The point is, a large part of this trip will exclude him in terms of food. \n\nWIBTA if I tried to talk him out of the trip?\n\n\nETA: Vegetarian/Chicken options aren\u2019t exactly going to solve this problem. My partners tastes are very very narrow. He would order the same style of pasta dish or grilled chicken no matter what place we go to\n\nETA 2: I think people are underestimating how much of a picky eater he is. He once disliked a chicken sandwich I ordered from an upscale place as a surprise dinner date meal because the patty was a fillet and not ground chicken (like McD) and it apparently had cheddar cheese instead of American cheese. \n\nWhen I tell you he only eats chicken and lamb, his what I am really telling you that his tastes are very very narrow. He would happily eat Indian dishes, Indo-Chinese, and even a few Italian dishes. But he wouldn\u2019t eat Chicken Thai Curry or even Authentic Ramen Dish with chicken. \n\nSo there\u2019s a GOOD chance he wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy any Japanese dish - even if it is chicken based.    \n\n\nEDIT: I have absolutely no idea why people think I assume that Japanese cuisine only consists of sushi and seafood. Why is everyone finding reasons to be upset about and feeling personally attacked? I live in a landlocked state in my country and we get no seafood here so yea from my POV Japan is a place where there\u2019s relatively more seafood in dishes. Isn\u2019t that obvious? \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt\u2019s like when someone says that Pasta is an Italian dish and imagine all Italians are offended why that person didn\u2019t mention the hundreds of other dishes they have. Chill \n\n\nFINAL EDIT: I am planning on talking to him and sharing the itinerary that my parents and I decided. He\u2019s welcome to join, but we won\u2019t compromise on changing places. Of course, he has the option to meet us back later after meal times, and I still think it\u2019s a silly idea as having meals is going to be a decent part of trip and spending time together as a family so not sure why people here think that\u2019s a good idea, but I am still willing to give it a shot and see how he feels about it. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t get why people are even suggesting he eats Indian, Chinese or Italian food on a trip to Japan or even McDonald\u2019s for God\u2019s sake\u2026 what would be the point in eating fast food or a non-speciality on such a trip? Please hear yourselves first. \n\nPeople seem to think I don\u2019t want my husband to join and want to ditch him. Maybe wonder there might be valid reasons behind my opinion? Would you invite someone to go scuba diving with you if they legitimately don\u2019t even know how to swim? \n\nI don\u2019t get the hostility, I am perfectly capable of acknowledging it was wrong to intend talking him out of it. And no, my parents don\u2019t hate him, he\u2019s a lovely son to them but were concerned about how it would impact us all. He\u2019s more flexible than me when it comes to temper so no I am not trying to paint him in a bad light. \n\nA redditor suggested why extend a polite invite to him when you don\u2019t want them to join you? Isn\u2019t it obvious if they didn\u2019t, you guys would still call them an AH? Now that they did, you are still calling them an AH and calling me an elitist. You ASSUME just because I live in a landlocked state in India, I can still manage to get seafood here. Still wondering who\u2019s an elitist for assuming everyone has options like they do in America? \n\n\nTLDR: Stop being so dramatic.

Is there no compromise? I mean Japan has to have other foods.", "YWBTA if you talked him out of the trip. The only way you can redeem this is if you explain the full situation to him. That you want to go to Japan, you and your family have a set list of places you want to eat at. and that he would need to either be ok with the food on the menu or that he would need to figure something else out.\n\nBut you have to explain that this is something that you're doing for yourself and the love you have for japanese seafood with your family. \n\nit's that simple.\nif he still wants to go, reiterate that you will not compromise for him. you already compromise for him at home, this is for you. \n\nif he doesn't want to go, that's on him but you laid everything out for him.", "I lived in Japan when I was a kid (Navy Brat) and not only do I not prefer seafood, my mother is terribly allergic to seafood. Plenty of authentic Japanese restaurants in Japan are not seafood-only.", "YTA \n\nIt is very likely that the \u201cauthentic high end\u201d places you plan to go to will have the grilled chicken option he\u2019s looking for. \n\nAnd if not, you can always decide to separate during dinner time and come back together after. This is not ideal but better then him not coming at all. \n\nThere are a few compromises, which makes it fell that at least from your parents don\u2019t want him to come along and use food as an excuse", "YTA if you don't invite him. I personally would be pissed. Talk to him, explain what you want to do in terms of food and let him make a decision. I doubt there won't be any food for him..........", "YTA. Invite your husband, let him know there might be limited food choices at times, but definitely invite him.", "On one hand, I sympathise. I could not handle being married to a picky eater. However, you did willingly marry a picky eater so you need to compromise. Is he willing to just eat a plain bowl of rice for example while you guys get your seafood on and then grab a sandwich from a convenience store if he is still hungry? Is he willing to eat somewhere else nearby and then join you afterwards? I think you should talk to him about it and see if he is willing to compromise. As a foodie, most of my dream holidays are planned around eating my way across various countries. But there is also much more to the experience of visiting a country than only the food. YWBTA if you don't at least try to agree on a plan to work around his pickiness in a way that doesn't compromise your parents foodie bucket list. Everybody just needs to be on the same page.", "YWBTA if you tried to talk him out of it, but I do think you should talk to him. Make it clear that you may go to a lot of restaurants that do not have food he likes and since this is a rare opportunity you want to make the most of it. Maybe he decides to come for just part of the trip, or bring someone else a long who he can spend time with in Japan.", "Yes, YTA. Japan has a wide variety of cuisine outside of seafood. The fact that someone else\u2019s dining choices would severely impact your group\u2019s enjoyment as a whole is wild. I suggest the rest of you branch out outside of seafood. This is not at all a problem.", "I think you just need to sit him down and have a conversation. He knows he is a picky eater and you have tried your best in trying to make him branch out and try new things which have not worked. Just say we want to go restaurants that specialise in seafood and eat at street vendors and you would think finding a dish to keep him happy would be slim to none. So you are going with your parents and let him pick a place for the next trip together that would keep him comfortable.", "Info - does he go into a strop when he doesn't like something?

There is more to Japanese culture than seafood.", "YTA. My wife and I make compromises on food due to dietary restrictions, allergies and preferences. The fact that your family wants you to take care of the situation and only extended the invite out of obligation shows a lack of respect which is most likely due to your lack of respect for him. Have some common decency.", "yes you would. YWBTA. Christ, surely theres more to Japan than fish in upscale restaurants?", "I'm going NAH so long as this is honestly and reasonably discussed.\n\nPicky eaters can really ruin a lot of experiences, you're always worrying if they can find something they'll eat, or if they're going to have a panic over something they won't.\n\nSo long as you approach this honestly and directly, and tell him exactly what the problem is, then NAH.", "YWBTA\n\nJapan does have other food as well as fish. \n\nGo take him with you but explain there will be sea food, but make it clear there is other food as well. Japanese cuisine is very varied.", "Honestly I can understand why some people are upset, but I\u2019ve been to Japan and you WILL compromise your trip by trying to accomodate him.\n\nPlus you sound like a foodie so it will impact you.\n\nIf you can sensitively say you are going on a family trip. I\u2019m not sure how you would do that but you\u2019ll end up pissed if you have to spend half your time trying to find him food. As u need to eat 3 meals a day\n\nSo NTA only cos it seems like the whole holiday is about food. Maybe next holiday is all about something else", "YWBTA \n\nJust invite him but make it clear a large part of the trip will be about food and cuisine. But also can you not go to the same places and do different things?\nFor example, if you and your parents went to an all you can eat sushi train for a couple of hours, that would give him time to grab a snack from 7/11 and explore an old castle or go for a walk in a park. You can then meet back at the hotel at night and share what you each did and saw.\n\nThere is so much to do in Japan that doesn't revolve around food. It has so much unique history, culture, and wildlife. It is perfectly acceptable to go on holiday with someone and do different activities while you're there. It will give you good time to bond with your parents, and he can do activities that he enjoys too.", "NAH\n\nI used to be this picky with food, and it absolutely ruined certain events and locations for my parents, who spent more time worrying about what I would eat than just enjoying their own meals. Granted, I was a child at the time, so it was their job to worry, but I knew how frustrating and infuriating it was. I outgrew this stage, and they *still* tell me how much better life is now they don't have to cater to my food requirements.\n\nEveryone's being incredibly critical of you, but you're here asking for advice. That's a good sign; you want to do the right thing by everyone. I would invite him, but be very blunt about the fact that you're not going to pander to his pickiness. You and your parents are going primarily for the food, and you're going to eat and enjoy what you like. He will likely not eat the same things in the same places as you. Is he OK with that?\n\nHe's an adult. He might say, 'You're right. We just won't eat together often.' He might decide not to come. But this isn't a couples trip - it's your parents' trip and you both are additional invites. You both work around their requirements, not the other way around.\n\nPerhaps try to find some authentic Japanese cuisine in advance and try it together. This may encourage him to try new things, or it may not, but it will give a better idea of what he should expect.", "YTA. Japanese food isn't ONLY seafood, and you can get food from other cultures there, too. If you and your family want to get traditional sushi and seafood and your husband can't find anything on the menu that he's willing to try, perhaps he can go find himself food he would enjoy while you eat with your family.", "I want to say YTA for thinking Japanese Food is all seafood based. Screams racist undertones. Now I could be wrong and perhaps your family just enjoys Japanese style seafood so okay.Honestly I think im going to say maybe y'all should broaden your tastes and go find non seafood Japanese food.\n\nThis is wild. If I was going on a trip with my husband to Japan (I would take him regardless lets be real, this isn't a question for most people) I would ensure that when we as a group or even just us as a couple, we went to places that could accommodate both of us. Do you not do this now?", "NAH. Just be up front with him and let him decide. But be clear that your family are going to try as much varied food as possible, and that there may constantly be food options that don't suit him unless he branches out.", "I have questions \n Is hubby the kind of person that would force his eating choices on the group, i.e. limiting restaurant choices and/or throwing fits if you want to eat what he won't?\n\nIf not, is the concern that the group would be uncomfortable eating if he was not? If so, is it possible for him to do something else during the times you and your parents want to have a more adventurous meal?", "NTA but this is more about how he communicates and reacts. If he does not care and will be happy to eat from seven eleven there snd then just eat rice at the restaurant then great. But if he is both picky and expects you all to eat where he can be accomodated do not take him on the trip.", "A lot of Y T A judgments . I'll abstain from it. Talk to your husband. Go through what is planned. Have him decide whether this trip is for him or not. Sounds like it is not. Or as some said. Do activities together and when  it's food time he can go find something for himself.\n\nAlso, I'd go fucking insane if my gf was as picky as he is.\n\nI don't understand why people are jumping down OPs throat and calling her racist. It's well known that there are a lot of specialized restaurants in Japan. Their trips target is mainly seafood experience.", "NTA If food is such a big issue maybe you guys should separate or find partners who enjoy each others company rather than how they will make others feel.", "NTA. There was a similar post not long ago (but they usually solo travelled and the new picky eating gf was inviting herself on his trip).  You could take some trips to some Japanese restaurants, try it out to see if there's anything he can/would eat and how he gets on with it. If it's an absolute no, then tell him that, and explain the reasons.\n\nBut saying that, being married does not exclude you from amazing opportunities with your family, and does not mean you need to be joined at the hip. It's a trip with your mom, dad and sibling, you should be able to go on it without your husband even aside from the food issues that would make it miserable for everyone.\n\nAgain don't understand the y t a votes.\n\nAnd yes, there is a lot more to Japanese culture than just food, but a lot also revolves around food, and he can't go the duration of the trip not eating, and you can't expect everyone else to spend their time in Japan catering to the needs of a super picky eater.", "NAH; he doesn't eat seafood; but you do.  There is nothing wrong in that.  \n\nHowever, you (and he) could make the effort of educating yourselves about vegetarian options for authentic Japanese food -- ranging from steamed, through stir fry, and onto tempura.  Google it; you'll be surprised by the many options would/could available to him. As long as he (it IS his responsibility, after all) has prepared himself on his culinary options, you can both have a good time.", "So he's a picky eater, BUT YOU DISCOURAGE HIM FROM TRYING NEW FOOD AND HAVE DONE FOR A LONG TIME. LMAO, YOURE A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE.\n\nif you discourage him from trying new things and have done for a long time, you're actually being slightly abusive, but also VERY controlling.\n\nYou've done this to yourself. \n\n\nAlso, thinking that there is only seafood and sushi at all restaurants in Japan is insanely fucking racist holy fuck\n\n\nWork on yourself.", "I wouldn't say AH, but your fears are a bit unfounded. If you are thinking purely economical and in terms of \"he will not get the same value from the money as people who also enjoy the food\" then maybe there is something to it if he agrees, but if it is because you think he will be a downer \\*for you\\*, and he himself will not feel bad about not enjoying all the foods that you do, that sounds a bit selfish. \n\nHe is an adult and can make his own decision regarding that.  I mean, what if someone who really enjoyed cos-play decided that you are \"not worthy\" of going to Japan because you don't appreciate seeing it as much as they would? Or what if the sushi shops you plan to go to decide that you are not worthy to eat there because, even though you like it, you will not appreciate it as much as someone with a more knowledgable palate can, and it will be a downer for the other people there to see you not fully enjoying it?\n\nI run tours in Japan and have people with all kinds of dietary requirements or likes/dislikes or allergies, etc. It is completely possible for people to have a great time even without enjoying all the food.\n\nI know people that have lived here for decades and can not even stand the smell of fish near them for dinner. They seem to do just fine and have a healthy social life, not relegated to eating cup noodles in their room in the dark alone.\n\nYour husband's eating habits sound like my dad when he come to visit. He is deathly alergic to shellfish, and although he doesn't \"dislike\" most of the food, he is terrified of accidentally eating it, so will absolutely not try anything other than plain noodles in broth that he knows has no shellfish. Literally, every meal is plain soba in broth.  He has been here several times and managed to enjoy it even while the rest of us are eating other things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
