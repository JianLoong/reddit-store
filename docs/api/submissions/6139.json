And their personal hygiene\u2026my god, the smell, the sight\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t understand how people live like this. It\u2019s something out of an episode of Hoarders. \n\nAnyway, they visited us once before and stayed in our home. They stole from us, helped themselves to the contents of our pantry and refrigerator; the mom and sister helped themselves to some of my clothes and makeup and toiletry items and took one of my credit cards as well as cash. And the mess they left behind! They tracked in some dog poop all over our floors. They threw trash all over. The utter chaos happened so fast, and as someone who keeps a clean home (we aren\u2019t talking a sterile field here, just normal average home with a little clutter; the laundry isn\u2019t always done and there might be a dish or two in the sink; we aren\u2019t nut jobs)\u2026My god. \n\nTheir visit was one of the worst times of my life.

If they want us to visit their area we can stay at a hotel. Fine. Because there\u2019s also the the issue of them having bedbugs, roaches, and fleas. \n\nAnd here is where my AITA comes in. His grandpa has recently died and so my husband is feeling in the family way and is wanting the rest of the family to visit and stay in our home. I\u2019m a hard NO and reminded him of our deal. And my hard NO is where I might be the asshole. There\u2019s been a death in the family. And as flawed and disgusting as I consider them, they are still his family. \n\nHowever, their last visit traumatized me and I had very little help from him in cleaning up after them. In fact he hardly helps at all (I blame his upbringing\u2014he doesn\u2019t know how to clean or when you need to clean and we have to fight against him covering every surface with random shit). I can\u2019t take another repeat! \n\nPersonally I think my reasonable compromise of them staying in a hotel is fine but he disagrees and thinks I am TA.

You are not his maid.\n\nNTA they stole from you and trashed your house. Stay in a hotel, or let your hubby go stay with his family for a while and you stay home and enjoy the peace xxx", "NTA.  They stole from you.  They are lucky you did not file criminal charges.  Tell him he can visit them", "NTA. You are under no obligation to host people who have stolen from you, trash your home, and could possibly bring their own infestation with them.\nStick with the \"hard no!\"", "NTA. The grandfather\u2019s death does not excuse their lack of hygiene and the fact they stole from you on a previous visit.", "NTA, if they are revolting bed bug and fecal covered thieves they should not be allowed anywhere near you home (kids?) etc.\n\n\nIf you do buckle (which you shouldn\u2019t) I\u2019d imagine husband will be even more upset when you file a police report than he is by living up to his agreement, so you\u2019re sparring him as well, everyone wins by them being banned (they don\u2019t get arrested)", "NTA.\n\nNot allowing thieves into your house is just common sense.", "You are NTA your home was invaded you were stolen from and it\u2019s honestly awful for him to expect you to allow that again", ">so my husband is feeling in the family way \n\nI think I might be TA here because after I read this particular part all I could think about as I tried to read the rest of the post was OP's husband being pregnant. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Your mental health shouldn't be sacrificed because he's feeling nostalgic. Believe me, if you get bedbugs, the trauma will be much worse. Your husband made an agreement with you. He must now abide by it.", "NTA\n\nYou came to an agreement and now he\u2019s trying to back out, not your problem. The compromise of them staying in a hotel makes perfect sense. Also, they could infest YOUR home with bedbugs just from the clothes they\u2019re wearing!?", "NTA. Death in the family or not, they STOLE from you. They can infest your home with bedbugs and roaches! Don't let them in girl! Your health is at risk!", "NTA. He agreed to them not being in the home again. I don't want to sound insensitive, but his grandfather's death doesn't change that. I mean it wasn't agreed not in the home until Grandpa or other family members die.", "NTA. Sorry for the loss of his grandpa, but that doesn't change their behavior.", "NTA. Circumstances aside, these are people who actively steal from you and passively destroy your home.\n\nHow grandpa died may be tragic, but that still doesn't require you to let your house be thrashed again.\n\nLive by the old adage; fool me once....", "NTA", "A hotel is fine.

Your husband is an A H because you came to a compromise and agreement and now, he is trying to go back on his agreement. His relatives are A H and beyond A H.", "NTA.  That sucks his grandfather died but his family is gross and thieves.  And your husband is awful for not helping you clean (and I\u2019m guessing get back the stuff they stole from you) the last time they stayed with you.", "NTA. Your husband can go stay in the hotel with his family.

Grandpa can now be allowed to visit.\n\nYour husband's family was banned from your home because they literally trashed it and stole from you. Have you changed to the point where a repeat performance would not upset you? Assuming not, you have no reason to consider changing the agreement unless and until you have seen evidence that his family members have changed their ways for the better.", "NTA. Stick with your hard no.

NTA. The issue isn\u2019t just the hoarding/bad hygiene\u2014they literally stole from you and crossed a lot of boundaries. These people have no respect for your home or your belongings and have proven they can\u2019t be gracious guests. They need to prove themselves before getting that access again.", "NTA - death in the family means there\u2019s one less person to steal from you, but it won\u2019t stop the others from stealing or prevent an infestation of your home.", "NTA\n\neven if it is just \"the rest of the family\" coming to stay there is a good chance that the thieves would come over to visit them.", "NTA. They stole from you and trashed your house! No further discussion needed. You didn't report them. They don't get a second chance to violate you and your home.", "NTA. My sister is very similar to your in laws and what works for us when we want to visit each other is to stay at the same hotel so we are separated but still together. \nThis advice may be unsolicited, but make sure that if he goes into their home to isolate the luggage and clothing he brings back. You do not want to bring bed bugs (and other critters) into your home.", "NTA. I would be a hard no too. I mean, they\u2019re gross! And they will have bedbugs in their clothes. Does he really want the expense of trying to get rid of bedbugs in your house? Because those suckers are hard to kill. And they stole from you! It sucks his grandfather died, but that doesn\u2019t change how his family is and that you are allowed to not want disgusting thieves in your home. Be firm with him.", "NTA. A death in the family changes nothing. They can visit and stay at a hotel and meet you in public.", "NTA, why is it so difficult to get in professionals to clean and declutter their house. That way he can go home and spend some time with them.", "The death of the grandfather doesn't change the fact they stole from you and abused your trust.   Stick to your guns", "NTA do not let them back in the house, have them stay at a motel/hotel. They are dirty and stole from you. If he gets mad tell him to stay at the hotel with them", "NTA, don't doubt yourself for a minute...they stole from your house.", "NTA! I'm very sorry he had a death in his family, but it's your home too. If his family staying ends up causing you extra work and stress than normal visitors do, he needs to help. He showed last time that he won't, so put your foot down. Nope. Gross.", "I feel like people throw the word \"traumatized\" around way to much. Anyway NTA", "No no a thousand times no.  Sorry hubby.  Too bad about his grandpa but that does not mean you deserve torture.  If he doesn't like it he can go live with them.  You are not TA.

I still struggle with anxiety and have worked very hard for the clean and uncluttered home that he and I have made together. I had a panic attack about our house and how it looked because of their visit, not to mention everything they stole from us. So yes, it was traumatic. Recently I had to have a major surgery and was physically unable to clean and declutter and my husband just can\u2019t do it.

I\u2019ve explained so many times why I need those spaces free of clutter but the message just hasn\u2019t gotten through. Also, I do the grocery shopping. Well, if husband does the grocery shopping, he puts the bags on the counter and leaves them there. I did an experiment to see how long it would take him to actually put them away.
