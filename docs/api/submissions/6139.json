Their home is hoarded-just stacks and stacks and piles of worthless shit and garbage; animal feces; it\u2019s filthy, smells horrific, and is infested by roaches, fleas, and bedbugs. And their personal hygiene\u2026my god, the smell, the sight\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t understand how people live like this. It\u2019s something out of an episode of Hoarders. \n\nAnyway, they visited us once before and stayed in our home. They stole from us, helped themselves to the contents of our pantry and refrigerator; the mom and sister helped themselves to some of my clothes and makeup and toiletry items and took one of my credit cards as well as cash. And the mess they left behind! They tracked in some dog poop all over our floors. They threw trash all over. The utter chaos happened so fast, and as someone who keeps a clean home (we aren\u2019t talking a sterile field here, just normal average home with a little clutter; the laundry isn\u2019t always done and there might be a dish or two in the sink; we aren\u2019t nut jobs)\u2026My god. \n\nTheir visit was one of the worst times of my life. Husband and I made a deal\u2014I don\u2019t report them to the police if they never set foot in our home again. If they want to drive to our area and stay at a hotel, fine. If they want us to visit their area we can stay at a hotel. Fine. Because there\u2019s also the the issue of them having bedbugs, roaches, and fleas. \n\nAnd here is where my AITA comes in. His grandpa has recently died and so my husband is feeling in the family way and is wanting the rest of the family to visit and stay in our home. I\u2019m a hard NO and reminded him of our deal. And my hard NO is where I might be the asshole. There\u2019s been a death in the family. And as flawed and disgusting as I consider them, they are still his family. \n\nHowever, their last visit traumatized me and I had very little help from him in cleaning up after them. In fact he hardly helps at all (I blame his upbringing\u2014he doesn\u2019t know how to clean or when you need to clean and we have to fight against him covering every surface with random shit). I can\u2019t take another repeat! \n\nPersonally I think my reasonable compromise of them staying in a hotel is fine but he disagrees and thinks I am TA. Is my hard NO of them ever setting foot in our home unreasonable? AITA?\n\nEdit to add: thank you everyone for your kindness and support. I\u2019ve been feeling quite bad about drawing this hard line but I\u2019m not going to budge. I\u2019m also going to be doing a bit of soul searching around how our household\u2019s boundaries and guidelines around cleanliness and order are set as well and take a hard look at things.", "created_utc": 1672512748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1000wgp/aita_for_banning_my_husbands_family_from_our_home/", "score": 387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
