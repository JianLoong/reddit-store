Jokes like that run deeper than they seem. If he knows you've struggled with your weight why even bring it up? Why tell you to count calories? That's not a joke that's telling you to lose weight and then laughing. Tell him how it made you feel and that he shouldn't joke like that. If he saw it hurt you he should say sorry, that he didn't mean it, and not that you are overreacting.", "NTA \n\nThat was super rude!!! What was the joke? That you\u2019re gaining weight? How is that funny when he knows your sensitive about the subject. The funny part of a joke shouldn\u2019t be that it hurt someone\u2019s feelings", "NTA. Your boyfriend's comment was obviously a slam on your appearance, not a joke. Justifying rude comments with \"it was just a joke\" is classic bullying behavior.\n\nI think you should do a serious analysis of how often you have to do mental gymnastics to justify your boyfriend's comments. Is he really hysterical, or is he just mean?", "NTA\nThat is not a joke. That is a seriously rude and disrespectful comment.", "NTA - totally unthinking of him. You did not overreact, you just reacted emotionally to something that triggered you emotionally. He never ever needs to point out your weight, you're well aware of what it is. He should just STFU and learn from this.", "NTA boyfriend can not possibly be so dense that he thought that was a funny joke.", "NTA, that was unnecessary and mean.", "Ask your bf how he'd feel if you commented on him needing to improve his skills in the bedroom, and then justifying that comment by saying you were joking.\n\nNTA", "NTA and reconsider moving in together. \n\nFirst days and he\u2019s already \u201cjoking\u201d about restricting your food? Commenting on your weight? \n\nYour feelings are valid and he\u2019s an ass. I\u2019m sorry, image issues are such a struggle and your partner shouldn\u2019t be making them worse. He should be a source of support and encouragement.", "NTA. That was not funny. That was just him being an AH.", "NTA.", "NTA- totally not funny and since you did not laugh wasn't a joke", "NTA. \n\nHe is an AH for saying you overreacted. Even if he \n said the \"joke\" without much thought,  it still hurt your feelings and he should have apologized for saying that. \nHim saying you overreacted really pissed me off.", "If this is someone you've been with for so long and knows about your struggles then this is in very poor taste.

Sit down with him again and remind him about your weight sensitivity and set the boundary. If he can't respect it or understand what he did wrong, it's time for another discussion.\n\nWeight is an inappropriate joke 100% of the time (also, weight-based \"jokes\" just straight up aren't funny? C'mon, be clever dude). It's just disrespectful.", "NTA and he's an idiot for not still making weight jokes in the year 2023. That said, this is not a massive big deal and seems easily resolved by discussing your feelings about your weight and why this comment seemed so mean and inconsiderate to you. If he gets it and stops the bad joke train then great. If not, you may have other issues to deal with.", "Maybe you should just lose some weight.", "ESH -\n\nHe's an asshole for getting to 25 and not knowing that\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. This is a hot button issue for you\n2. You don't joke with anybody about their weight\n3. YOU DON'T JOKE WITH ANYBODY ABOUT THEIR WEIGHT\n\nYou're an asshole for throwing a tantrum. The correct move would be: \"I don't care if it's a joke - it's not funny. At all. Do not make that joke with me. Ever. Again. Capisce?\" If no apology is forthcoming - then it's futon time. Most guys with an appropriately-developed self preservation instinct will immediately see the error of their ways and fall all over themselves apologizing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You reacted appropriately", "OP you did nothing wrong. That person gave shitty advice. The fact he told you the next day that you overreacted shows he had no plan to apologize. He knows you have insecurities regarding your weight, and he made the \u201cjoke\u201d knowing it would hurt your feelings. He\u2019s either extremely dense or (more likely) doesn\u2019t have a high regard for your feelings. \n\nHopefully it was a one-off thing, but be aware that this is a common manipulation tactic. People will belittle their partners to cut down their confidence, so that you\u2019ll feel more dependent on them\u2026 Just a red flag to watch out for. It\u2019s really not hard to respect your partner\u2019s feelings, and you\u2019re totally justified for feeling hurt.", "Okay - tantrum is probably (definitely?) strong (wrong?), but you did escalate the situation after his preemptive assholery.\n\nThe old advice of \"don't ever go to bed mad at each other\" is good advice. Marriage/partnership/cohabitation is hard enough - even with good communication. Cutting off that communication with a locked door just makes it harder. Sometimes, \"good communication\" boils down to the brutal truth: \"You're being an asshole, dear. Apologize. Now.\"  \n\n\nDid he deserve an ass-chewing? Definitely. Did he need to spend the night on the sofa? Probably - depending on the immediacy of a sincere apology. From my own experience, white hot anger is a more effective training tool than the cold shoulder.\n\nYou're going to fight and disagree with your partner - it's just a fact of relationships. You've gotta learn to do it right, do it fair, and do it in such a way that minimizes hurt on all sides. Would that I learned this 30 years ago.", "Going to THEIR room and shutting him out is\u2026, but he was an AH, probably meant no harm. Accept an apology and move on."]}
