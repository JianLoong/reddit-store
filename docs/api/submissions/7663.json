I'm the sole income-provider for the home.\n\nMy daughter has a summer job at a restaurant where she has to take the city bus to and fro everyday.  She normally leaves home by 11am and  comes home by 9pm.\n\nOne day, she  called me from her job at 10pm, saying she was asked to stay behind  because one of her colleagues didn't show up.  She had to stay at least  another hour, and asked me if I can pick her up because it was dark outside, and the buses were running less frequently.\n\nI said no, because I had to work the next day and be awake by 6:30a.m.   She didn't argue back, and instead said then she'll be coming home close to midnight if she was to take the buses (which is past her usual curfew).   I told her she should try to leave her job as soon as possible, but I need my rest before work.  My wife cannot drive, and neither can my son.\n\nShe eventually came home close to midnight like she said, and although she hasn't been disrespectful to me, I could tell she was at least unhappy with coming home later than usual.  Since then, she had days when she would be calling to tell us she would be coming home by midnight (and sometimes even later than that), but she never asked me to pick her up again.  I know she doesn't go anywhere besides work, because she's dressed in her uniform when she leaves and comes back home.\n\nMy wife told me she can hear my daughter come home when she opens and closes the door, which throws her sleep off.  I told my daughter the  next day that she should try to be more considerate of her brother and mother (as my son sleeps in the living room and my wife is a light sleeper) and try to be quiet as possible if she is coming home so late because the rest of the family is sleeping.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I almost saw anger in my daughter's eyes.  She said it's not her fault that the buses run late, that her boss is asking her to stay (quite a few of her colleagues quit the job  apparently) and that she needs the money for her university fees anyway.   That sounded as if she is completely blaming me for her circumstances  and she has no sympathy for the rest of the family.\n\nSo, AITA for telling my daughter to take the bus home late at night, even though I have to work the next day?", "created_utc": 1674071831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fgzbh/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_has_to_get_home/", "score": 321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not *almost* show anger? Not have the meerest hint of annoyance in her *expression* at your continued, profound lack of support for her situation? Do you expect her just to evaporate into thin air, as not to bother you? Or teleport from her job to get room, where she will remain neither seen nor heard? \n\nYou use your 6.30am start as a reason why you can't give your daughter a ride. Fair enough. By the same token, your wife and son - who don't work - can suck it up when their sister gets in later. Why does she get so little consideration for her needs, while everyone else in the family gets to be self-serving?", "YTA. I\u2019m not even gonna make a long comment because it\u2019s VERY straightforward! Your TEENAGE daughter is fucking outside at dark at 10pm. Go get her dude.", "YTA - your entire family are horrible people! Your 18 year old called to ask you for a lift home because it was late and she stayed later at work to help out, she wasn't doing anything wrong she was at work. You refused! Which was your first AH move. My parents used to get up at 4am to go to work and they still came to get my friend and I at the entrance to clubs at 2am. Secondly, your daughter is being responsible by working and coming home before her cerfew and even advising you guys she will be late and your punishing her even further by telling her that her coming home late is disrupting your wife and sons sleep schedule even though, as you've said, your wife doesn't work, so WHO CARES about her sleep schedule! You need a serious reality check and you need to be grateful for your daughter, take better care of her before you risk ruining your relationship with her, she is a responsible adult and you need to stop babying your wife and son and take care of your daughter as her parent!", "\u201cI\u2019m a middle aged man that doesn\u2019t give a shit about my daughters safety because my sleep is more important\u201d\n\nYTA", "Not only are YTA but your priorities are screwed up. I don't know any father that would be more concerned about his teenage daughter not being totally silent when she came home than her riding the bus alone late at night.

All you and your wife are concerned about is y\u2019all\u2019s damn sleep. Where is the concern for your daughter\u2019s safety?

You insist you cannot help her with transportation yet whine about things that are out of her control like when the buses run and how late she has to work? \n\nI suppose if she lost her job than you wouldn't have to worry about losing a little sleep.", "YTA. Make up your mind. Either you go get her and she wont be home late, or deal with the fact that she will be home late and dont complain about it.

Why did you have children?  It sounds like you resent having a daughter.  Jfc.", "OP doesn\u2019t seem like the type of parent I would see enforcing curfew.

I\u2019m sorry but I wouldn\u2019t blame if OP daughter went LC/NC with her parents cause it seem like she doesn\u2019t seem to be a part of this family.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is doing her best to earn money for her school fees and works a job with awful hours. She will probably get fired if she says no to staying late too often, so she can't really do that either. All you are thinking about is yourself and how inconvenient your daughter is. \n\nYou don't give a damn about her safety or you would have at least collected her the first time and verified she could get home reliably by bus. From your post it doesn't sound like she was slamming the door or anything. Opening doors and taking of shoes etc makes some noise. Combined with the fact that she will be tired when she comes home she might be a bit louder than strictly necessary, but her coming in this late is a direct result of having to rely on public transport. So you either have to deal with the inconvenience of picking her up or the inconvenience of some noise.\n\nDoes your daughter have a driver's licence? If so, could you help her get a car? Then you don't have to drive her and she will be home earlier. \n\nYou're nta for not wanting to collect her every evening. You do however come across like someone who really doesn't care about his daughter and her wellbeing. She also has NOT been disrespectful towards you or actually said that she blamed you. You have shown her that she can't rely on you if she needs help, so of course she won't call you or ask anything of you ever again.

I'm the sole income-provider for the home.\n\nMy daughter has a summer job at a restaurant where she has to take the city bus to and fro everyday.  She normally leaves home by 11am and  comes home by 9pm.\n\nOne day, she  called me from her job at 10pm, saying she was asked to stay behind  because one of her colleagues didn't show up.  She had to stay at least  another hour, and asked me if I can pick her up because it was dark outside, and the buses were running less frequently.\n\nI said no, because I had to work the next day and be awake by 6:30a.m.   She didn't argue back, and instead said then she'll be coming home close to midnight if she was to take the buses (which is past her usual curfew).   I told her she should try to leave her job as soon as possible, but I need my rest before work.  My wife cannot drive, and neither can my son.\n\nShe eventually came home close to midnight like she said, and although she hasn't been disrespectful to me, I could tell she was at least unhappy with coming home later than usual.  Since then, she had days when she would be calling to tell us she would be coming home by midnight (and sometimes even later than that), but she never asked me to pick her up again.  I know she doesn't go anywhere besides work, because she's dressed in her uniform when she leaves and comes back home.\n\nMy wife told me she can hear my daughter come home when she opens and closes the door, which throws her sleep off.  I told my daughter the  next day that she should try to be more considerate of her brother and mother (as my son sleeps in the living room and my wife is a light sleeper) and try to be quiet as possible if she is coming home so late because the rest of the family is sleeping.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I almost saw anger in my daughter's eyes.  She said it's not her fault that the buses run late, that her boss is asking her to stay (quite a few of her colleagues quit the job  apparently) and that she needs the money for her university fees anyway.   That sounded as if she is completely blaming me for her circumstances  and she has no sympathy for the rest of the family.\n\nSo, AITA for telling my daughter to take the bus home late at night, even though I have to work the next day?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
