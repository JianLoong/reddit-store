I replied that I didn\u2019t have that much free time. She questioned why and I tried to give her general answers but she just wouldn\u2019t drop it so I told her that I have hobbies and they take up some of my time.\n\nShe basically laughed at me and asked what \u201chobbies\u201d (she did use air quotation marks) could I possibly have that were more important. Honestly, she annoyed me so I listed all of them in one go (I wouldn\u2019t normally do that) which are (I take classes for most of them) swimming, Spanish, ballet, archery, fencing, writing my book, drums.\n\nShe basically laughed at me and asked me if my mummy was driving me around because it sounds like I was still doing extracurriculars after school. I told her she was being rude and to back off and she told me to rethink my priorities because I\u2019m an asshole for playing around instead of giving up more of my time for good cause.\n\nI asked her why she wouldn\u2019t do more hours (she does 2) and she said that\u2019s because she has kids and can\u2019t do any more than that. I told her she was an asshole for not trying and she literally cried and walked out.\n\nNow she\u2019s telling everyone that I\u2019m a selfish asshole who\u2019s also a brat and I\u2019m rude. And some people agreed with her that if I have so much free time for hobbies I should do more volunteer hours. \nI feel bad now though, maybe she\u2019s right, maybe I could volunteer more.

You give the time you want to, if you want to, when it's convenient for you and whatever you're volunteering for.  It's not a job, you're not paid (explicitly the opposite), and anyone that claims someone else isn't doing enough is always the AH.\n\nEnjoy your hobbies, and you should be clear with people there, that if they believe they should have a say in how you prioritize your time they can either pay you or you can volunteer elsewhere where it's appreciated without AH judgement.\n\nFinally, having not kids isn't a reason you can \"do more\", it's BS and you're not accountable to detail your time or interests to anyone.

You are volunteering however many hours *you* have to give, just like her.\n\nFuck does it matter to her or anyone else that you like to spend your time literally standing still in your house doing nothing or anything else?
