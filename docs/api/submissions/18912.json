Next time I suppose they would prefer you share nothing and avoid it becoming an issue. Maybe that will help the children learn to return things when the nice people who shared them want them back.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing inconsiderate about sharing your things according to your own needs.", "NTA for retrieving your property. The kids were in the wrong for not giving them back. No good deed goes unpunished.\n\nBut if you cursed them out then YTA for that and that alone. You could have gotten management involved instead.", "NTA Honestly who wants to go down chasing strangers kids and then dealing with their entitled mums.  When we as a multi family headed to the pool with grandma and cousins, grandma brought everyone a pool noodle as there always high in demand at the local pool.  As things go the kids got sick of them for a bit, so I was sitting with our gear and got approached by a girl, wanting to play with them.  That exact same scene flashed in my mind so I told her no, she immediately asked why not and I nicely replied with a smile that I don\u2019t share my toys.\n\nThe little girl instantly understood and walked away, of course five mins later the kids all came back wanting their noodles again.  You don\u2019t need to entertain the whole pool, just be politely firm and if they whine advised them to remind their mothers that water guns at the pool would be a lot of fun.", "NTA\n\nWhy everyone so pressed about whether he cursed?\nThose lil brats had it coming.\nThe fact that 2 adults told them to give back something that was not their's and they out right refused....says all we need to know.\nI would have cursed out the parents though, because their children's behaviour is a reflection on their parenting.", "NTA but after trying to ask the children for your toys back and them not doing so, you should have gone to their parents to let them know what was going on and have them get the toys back from their ungrateful brats!", "INFO: Did you curse at the kids or not? Of course they need to give you back the guns, but you could sure be an asshole depending on what you said and how you said it.", "INFO\n\nDid you curse at the kids?", "I would say NTA but not sure about the cursing part.  Totally fair to expect and request toys to be returned timely.  Swearing/being aggressive with stranger\u2019s children not so much - best to ask their parents.  Need more information.", "Did you actually curse at those kids?  If so YTA.  Don\u2019t curse at other peoples kids for just being kids annoying as they are.   But I would definitely want my kids toys back before leaving and they should have given them right back when asked.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can play with them for 15 minutes, then you must return them. Then give a 3 minute warning. Many kids have trouble with transitions so this can make it easier, especially if parents are not actively supervising.", "NTA. My toddler is better behaved than these kids when borrowing a toy at the pool. Their parents should have intervened way sooner and to make them give the guns back, not to yell at you.", "NTA  you had every right to get your property back. These are items you paid money for. \n\nThe others didn't want a confrontation and why they chose to just let the kids keep them. \n\nMaybe they suspected that the children's parents might be difficult as well since their children refused to return items they knew belonged to you and were asked for them back  Which was confirmed when \"how dare you take those toys away from my child and cursing\" - your toys were keeping their kids entertained without them having to play with their own children. \n\nAnd even if you did curse those kids out (which you didn't and those parents knew their kids were lying) their parents should have realized that things had escalated  - meaning their kids weren't listening. They should have have yelled at their kids for not only refusing to give the toys back but also going into the water as a deterrent to you getting them back. \n\nHad they raised their children properly there would have been no yelling involved and no situation to be avoided. And those kids should have returned the toys immediately and been thankful. Instead both children and their parents feel entitled. \n\nYou also know and so did you girlfriend that those children would never have given those guns back even had you waited until the pool closed. They'd have lied again in order to keep the toys.\n\nI'm glad you went after those toys. You showed your daughter that you took responsibility for loaning her toys to another,  you value her toys (and them), you will protect their toys,  and they also learned if they ever borrow you expect them to return it when asked. \n\nYou are a good dad and you set a good example for your daughter. Keep showing your child right/wrong and it's okay to go after her belobgings, and okay to stand up for herself.  \n\nNow onto your girlfriend. You may not have realized it yet, but learned something very important about her today. \n\nShe will not protect your child, put your child above her own comfort.  A parent or parent figure puts a child in their care before themselves. Coming along in a family outing as your girlfriend,  SO, placed her in the roll of protector.  She failed in protecting for child's belongings.\n\nShe also failed as your girlfriend when she not only didn't not support you,  but berated you for protecting your child's belongings as an extension of your child. \n\nYou also learned your girlfriend is more concerned about her convenience, appearance, and concerned with being embarrassed or causing a scene then supporting you.\n\nYour daughter also learned that your girlfriend won't be there for her. \n\nI would rethink this relationship.  She's shown you who she is. Believe her.  Her actions don't lie.", "NTA, and I'm so tired of entitled moms raising and encouraging bratty children.", "1000 percent NTA", "NTA! This is exactly why I stopped sharing toys when we went to the pool.", "I didn't curse at them. They just lied on me", "No I did tell them it wasn't cool that they made me enter the water to get them", "No. \n\nI told them \"hey we let you guys borrow them, we need them back. It's not cool that you guys made me come over here\"", "They lied on me.", "Then NTA.\n\nAnd their mothers were also AH because they should have made their kids return the toys when you asked for them.", "Is lying 'on' something a common phrase in the US or another country to refer to lying about something?", "Ok, then obviously you're not in the wrong here and you know it. Come on.", "Then NTA. The kids should have just given the toys back and not avoided you and your gf.", "Never heard it growing up in the Northeast US, but I've seen it online frequently in the last few years. Lying on, bragging on, loving on.", "I don't know. My siblings made a big deal. Saying I was trying to start something"]}
