She passed away when my son was 13 and he kept her collar with him. \n\nMy son moved out when he went to uni and left some stuff in his room and downstairs in the basement in (unmarked) boxes. I explicitly told him when he left to make sure he marked all his boxes but lo and behold, some boxes were unmarked. Months ago I wanted to clean out the basement so I took some boxes of old stuff there and put them outside to be tossed/given away. There were a lot of old toys so I let the neighbourhood kids rummage around and take whatever they wanted. I recall the kids finding a collar in the boxes and taking it because he was going to get a puppy for his birthday. My son was over for Thanksgiving and wanted to play the ukelele after eating but couldn't find it downstairs(it was also in an unmarked box and supposedly subsequently taken). I told him that months ago I was clearing the basement and most unmarked boxes, and their contents, were tossed/given away. He went back downstairs and came back screaming and cursing asking where the box with the collar was. I told him that I remembered them taking a collar but since we've had three dogs as a family, I didn't think to check which collar it was but if he can't find it then it was gone. He completely lost his marbles and yelled at me for giving away his things without talking to him. I reminded him that I'd told him to mark his stuff so I knew what to leave alone and what I could give away. He refused to listen and demanded I go get it back which I obviously refused to do because it was late and it's been months.\n\nI see how I could be wrong because it was his and sentimental but then again I warned him about unmarked boxes.

If I needed the room, I'd  invite him over and offer to help him clean out his things, because I am a PARENT and not a BULLY.  You weren't parenting your son, spending time with him, or teaching him skills. You carelessly threw away this things, let the neighborhood kids rummage through things that may have been private, and let someone take the dog collar of your son's  beloved pet.

It can also be used to contact people who are at a great distance and even share photos and video of the items.", "YTA. \n\nFYI, his feelings on this may not go away. My father, who is in his late sixties, is still pissed that his mother threw away his baseball cards when he was a college student. You really, really, should ask before you give/throw away your child's stuff. It doesn't matter if it was labeled perfectly or not.", "YTA and I'm honestly shocked you don't feel horrible about this.", "Damn. This breaks my heart. I still have my first dogs collar. I will never get rid of it. You knew it had sentiment, and still tossed it without asking him about it. YTA", "> I recall the kids finding a collar in the boxes and taking it\n\nSo you saw the kids take it and had the opportunity to stop them and say, \"Oh I'm sorry, that was in there on accident\"? You say you don't know which dog's collar it was, but you would have clearly seen it was his items when the box was opened, even if it was unmarked. And you knew who the neighborhood kids were and that they probably don't need a two decade old dog collar for a new puppy and you would be more than capable of buying a replacement and bringing it to these children's houses and explaining it to them?\n\nYou say you're not making a point about the unmarked boxes but you clearly are. If you aren't, your level of disregard for your son's property is astounding. YOU SAW IT WAS HIS STUFF WHEN YOU OPENED THE BOXES. My parents threw out some very important items of mine they found 'childish' without asking me on purpose. I will never forget it.

I\u2019ve gone very low contact with her over this bonkers behaviour and I\u2019m debating going no contact if she doesn\u2019t give me back the photos at the least. \n\nThrowing away or giving away your son\u2019s mementoes and possessions is cruel. Were those things really taking up so much space in your home that they needed to be thrown away immediately? Are you moving? Could you not send him the boxes of stuff? You weren\u2019t thinking about your son\u2019s feelings at all and now you\u2019ve hurt them quite badly. Apologize and do better, or risk being retirement age with an adult child who won\u2019t speak to you. My mom is pretty sad and lonely, but she knows what she has to do to fix it\u2026 it\u2019s been a decade and she\u2019s still hiding my things from me. She thinks she\u2019s done nothing wrong too.

It was pretty obvious a lot of the stuff in those boxes was sentimental type stuff and that he could easily have forgotten to mark them, especially in the shuffle of leaving home for the first time. How damn hard would it be to pick up the phone and ask if he really meant for all that stuff to be given away? And the collar especially- it can\u2019t have been too hard to figure out what it was and why it was kept.\n\nIf you know who the kid was who took it I\u2019d damn well try to make it right.

Calling him would have been the right thing to do, and you as the adult should know that.", "INFO: did you think that they were his boxes, or assume that they were communal property/stuff you\u2019d forgotten about? Did your son mark \u2018some\u2019 of his boxes, but not all? Because I can see why you\u2019d then assume that unmarked boxes were unwanted. But then, were you sort of proving a point when you threw stuff out? Did you suspect that he might want some of the stuff? It feels like a phone call could have prevented a lot of this!", "Yeah YTA. I guess you could declare you\u2019re in the clear because you decreed etc etc about marking boxes.. but deep down.. actually not even that deep.. you must\u2019ve realised you were potentially giving away things that might be sentimentally precious to your boy. Especially that collar! It wouldn\u2019t have hurt to hang onto the boxes long enough to thrust them in front of him when he was next at yours, and have him sort the stuff then and there. I feel bad for him.", "Apparently she never watched Toy Story 3.", "Im glad you arent my father", "Yep YTA, you couldn't have even asked before you let people rummage his belongings??? Be better, and get the collar back to try and fix this.", "YTA and you know it otherwise you would have told him before he went looking for his things.\n\nYes, you asked for the boxes to be labeled. But because he didn\u2019t label a fucking box you just decided to throw out his things? Memories of his childhood, his dog who died??\n\nAlso, did he actually move out or just go off to uni? Most people I know \u2018moved out\u2019 when they went to uni but still had their room in their parents house with loads of stuff in it. We all went home for holidays/summer and some moved back after graduating. Hell, my parents still have loads of me and my siblings crap and we\u2019re all mid to late twenties.\n\nUnless you\u2019re absolutely desperate for space I don\u2019t understand why you thought to just throw out boxes full of your sons things. And I can\u2019t imagine that some boxes in the basement were really pushing you over the edge of what could physically fit in your house, so I don\u2019t think you have any excuse for doing this other than maybe just being a huge asshole.", "Yikes. That's ice cold. Yta", "\u201cWell son you turned 18 so I\u2019ll be tossing away all your childhood memories after letting random neighborhood kids go through them.

You sure you marked all the boxes of stuff you wanted to keep in the basement? I\u2019m going to be throwing stuff out soon. Is there anything I should keep an eye out for or do you want to come by and check?\u201d\n\nThis is not hard. Life happens. Shit gets mislabeled/misplaced. YTA", "Honestly, my mind was basically entirely made up with just the question in the first place. Now, I try to take that in stride and not let my initial reaction shade my judgement. \n\nWith that disclaimer in place... Holy hell, YTA. It would have taken you no effort to withhold those boxes, no effort to communicate with your son and ask. You took the lazy way out, and gave away deeply sentimental items that belonged to your son that now cannot be replaced. What a way to devalue him and everything he cares about.", "I'm going to go with YTA.  A quick, \"hey, just double checking that these boxes don't have anything you want in them. I'm going to clean out the old stuff from the basement.\"  would have prevented this, and would have been a basic courtesy before throwing away another person's stuff. \n\nYes, you told him to mark it. Yes, he should have marked it. But teenagers aren't exactly known for their high levels of organization or responsibility. Going away to college is a very busy and chaotic time, the fact that he may have forgotten to mark some stuff isn't surprising. While technically, him not doing what he should have done means it \"his fault\", I'm of the opinion that family should be more considerate of each other. \n\nYou also didn't even apologize when you realized you  gave away an important sentimental item. When something like that happens, accident or not, because of his mistake or not, you apologize. \n\n\"I threw it out and it's your fault, not sorry\" isn't how a person should treat people they care about. It's callous. \n\nUltimately, he believed his things were safely stored at his parents' house, and he was wrong. I'm sure he'll adjust accordingly.", "YTA\n\nEven if he didn\u2019t write on the boxes. You knew it was his stuff.", "YTA\n\nIt's pretty easy to forget marking something when in the process of moving. Considering it's his first time put there on his own probably even more understandable. \n\nYou knew these were his things. You didn't look through them. You didn't call him. You just threw them out. And this makes you TA.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t feel the boxes being unmarked really matters, he could have simply missed some boxes in the shuffle and business of getting ready to leave for schooling. But you knowingly got rid of his possessions. You wouldn\u2019t blindly take boxes of your items out to the curb for the kids to go through. Meaning you opened the boxes, saw they were your sons items\u2026and without him there decided to still take them out to the curb like it was trash to you. The spot that dog held in your sons heart can never be replaced and that collar was the smallest part he could hold onto.", "YTA - You should have asked him before getting rid of his things. \n\nYou also should have not let the collar go when it was brought to your attention.", "YTA  The stuff's been sitting around for some time and you couldn't be bothered to check if there was something important?", "Yta.\n\nIn your own story you don't mention telling your son that you were clearing out boxes. You just.. grabbed whatever was unmarked and effectively threw it away. That's a terribly caviler attitude to have when dealing with someone else's property, especially if you know there may be other items in there he has an emotional attachment to.\n\nYou made the assumption that unmarked boxes were valid donation boxes, which is really unsound. You didn't even call your son to say, \"hey, I'm cleaning out the basement and found some boxes with your stuff in them, is it okay if I toss them?\"\n\nEven better would have been to just... Wait until the next time he came by and say \"please verify that these boxes don't have anything you want to keep\" and then put them out.\n\nYou're doubly the asshole because you *knew* your son's attachment to the collar and when it came up it didn't occur to you to say, \"actually wait, sorry, I wanna hang onto that for a little while.\"", "YTA.", "Mixed - he should\u2019ve marked the boxes but you also knew what you were doing and I feel you kind of did it a little out of spite to prove a point", "NTA if he wanted it saved he should have followed instructions and put it in a marked box.

Which is so sad because now his \u201cprize possessions \u201c from his childhood are thrown out or given away. so mean would a few more months of helping them have killed you ?  Kinda reminds me of the friends episode when the father used all Monica\u2019s childhood boxes ( weren\u2019t marked ) to block the water from flooding his car in the garage.", "YTA. How hard is it to open a box to check what\u2019s inside before throwing it all away!?\n\nAnd how hard is it to send a text to your son saying you\u2019re planning on doing a throw out and to come check the left over boxes!?\n\nAwful awful thing to do to your child.

I think it's sweet that the collar went to a little kids new puppy.", "YTA", "Technically NTA but you this was a harsh lesson that could have been kinder. A last call text would have cost 10 seconds of your time.", "NTA. It would have been nice of you to inform him before getting rid of the unmarked stuff, but if he had labeled his boxes in the first place this wouldn't be a problem. Especially since there were sentimental objects.\n\nAnd I can relate, I still have our first family dog's collar about 15 years later. Yes, I would be mad if it was thrown away at some point, but that anger would be directed at myself for not *labeling my stuff*. \n\nDude had even labeled some boxes but not others.

Your kid should have listened and marked the boxes, but as his parent, and knowing he hadn't done that, I frankly can't believe that you genuinely assumed there wasn't a fair chance you'd be getting rid of something he'd have wanted to keep.

Had I missed a box, it was made clear that no guarantee could be made that it wouldn't be potentially accidentally chucked out if they were clearing out the garage to make more room. If you've got enough kids, they will leave random boxes of stuff they don't really care about over the years - they'll get merged with other kids' stuff, none if it is precious, some of it is just 'Larry left this box here and went off to wherever for 6 months, let's stick it in the basement with Jenny's hockey gear she doesn't use anymore'. I feel like a LOT of people have unreasonable baggage about stuff they left behind and someone threw away by accident. If it's your stuff, you need to do what is required to keep it safe. If you don't label it, that's on you. Imagine being so attached to a dog collar as to cry about losing it - but not putting it somewhere safe? Just shoving it in an unmarked box with a bunch of old toys, in a basement full of old boxes...  \n\n\nIt seems obvious from this post that is was a genuine accident, made possible by the son's lack of care when labelling - thus the points about reminding him that she told him to label it, not to be vindictive but because she's feeling bad but made a mistake because of the prior point about labelling.

She told him that unmarked boxes may be tossed. He left unmarked boxes. That means \"I don't want this.\"\n\nTwo: I don't see anywhere that says that OP even knew precisely what was in the boxes. She said there were some toys so she tossed them out for the neighbor kids. She probably took a quick glance to see the genre of items in the box and made a quick decision.

He may have left it behind because while he wanted to get a fresh start, he still felt too connected to it to throw it out. If he had wanted to get rid of that box, he would have done it so himself.\n\nI just cannot imagine how his parents didn't put two and two together when they saw the box's content, or simply, why they didn't think communicating with their kid before doing anything with the stuff in it.", "My grandparents gifted my sisters and my lego stuff to a neighbor kid without asking first. We were furious about it.", "the fact she didn't even attempt to call or text to say \"oh, you didn't label these, what do you want me to do with them?\" like any rational person would, just immediately went ahead and gave them away tells me a few things; it wasn't about \"decluttering\" or whatever. on some level she was trying to cruelly teach her son a lesson/punish him for not following orders, i would for sure guess she has done things like this before (maybe not on this scale) to punish her son, and in a few decades she's going to wonder why she's in a retirement home.\n\nop, YTA. try harder to get that collar back at the very least and apologize. but if you don't?

Then I'd get back either an OK to sell it/trash it or she'd ask to have it mailed. Some items which were too difficult to mail, but still sentimental, she had me to get a few more photos of them at different nice angles for her to keep instead, and then I'd get rid of the item.

I was unsuccessful and had to watch, in horror, as she threw him into the blazing burn barrel.  I cried as I watched my best friend ablaze, dying a painful death in the barrel, my mother sticking and turning him with the pipe we used to stir the contents until he was fully engulfed. \n\nI\u2019m pretty certain I received another Teddy at some point as I know I slept with one almost every night, but that\u2019s not the point.
