But I\u2019m not. What you are doing is creepy.\u201d It\u2019s not ok for mom to step in on your adulting thing and trying to tag along to dance and meet guys. Love\u2026from a mom. It\u2019s not ok. Nta", "NTA your mom is\n\n- she tells you you\u2019re being jealous when you clearly aren\u2019t (WTF)\n- she\u2019s giving you the silent treatment (an emotional manipulation tactic) when she is clearly in the wrong\n\nI get if maybe she wanted to spend time with you but even then she should know her boundaries as your mom. And her telling you \u201cstop being jealous\u201d clearly shows that she is doing it for her own selfish reasons. Maybe because she had you when she\u2019s 17 so she may have missed out on clubbing idk but in this case she should hang out with her own girlfriends or your dad.", "NTA for one thing: she invited herself to an event that she was not invited to. And it sounds like she has been doing that a lot with you and your friends, and it\u2019s driving a wedge between you and her. All because she can\u2019t accept that she is older than you. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if she wants to go out clubbing - she\u2019s a big girl and can make her own decisions. However, she is being overbearing towards you and trying to take over your social life, and that is where the problem is. After all, you said your friends said they think it isn\u2019t normal either. It\u2019s not a mater if you being jealous - it\u2019s a matter of you being a young adult and wanting your own life away from your parents, as nature intended. \n\nYou tried to talk to her politely and privately about this and she didn\u2019t listen - this made a blow up inevitable. And by you - since she is your mother she is your responsibility. Your father wasn\u2019t any help - and this could have been prevented if he has listened to you and backed you up.", "NTA but it seems that your mother feels that she missed out on these activities probably due to the age she had you. Does she have any friends her age that she could go out with? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ideal if she just tags along with your friends, it\u2019s a bit weird.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m almost 40. \n\nI miss when I was younger. I miss looking and feeling like I\u2019m 25. \n\nBut time marches on and holding on the past is damaging to relationships, to self-esteem, and just plain sad.", "NTA\nIf your mom has a key to your apt, take it back. Do not allow her in your bedroom. No more trying on your clothes.\n\nThis is the time for you to develop your independent adult identity. Your mom's lack of respect for your privacy, and putting on your dress without asking are very concerning. Your young adult lifestyle isn't your mom's resource to use as she pleases.", "She is not too old for going to a bar, but stealing your clothes and inviting herself to someone\u2019s birthday party is really shitty behaviour", "It looks like the mom had you when she was a teenager. That\u2019s rough. If she was a good mom, she likely gave up all her fun years to look after you, and now she is trying to relive her lost youth. Yes, she should try to find friends her age to go out with, but that is also hard when you are older and have spent the last 20-something years busy looking after your family with probably little to no social life. \n\nNTA, but you should understand where she comes from and maybe take her out occasionally, like on her birthday.", "NTA but put yourself in her place. She\u2019s not too old to go to clubs and have fun, but I agree she shouldn\u2019t be inviting herself to hang out with you and your friends. Sounds like she missed out on her own youth - she was only 17 when you were born if the ages you said were correct. She was already raising a kid at your age, so I doubt she got to go to many clubs with her friends. Maybe you could invite her to do some fun activities with you once in awhile. You might enjoy girl time with your mom.", "NTA. You were absolutely right. You\u2019re mom has no business barging her way into clubbing with you and your friends  plus she\u2019s totally embarrassing herself by acting like she\u2019s one of you.", "Your mom had you when she was 17. She may have some deep feelings of having missed out on the carefree 20s that she is currently seeing you enjoy, that she never did. \nSounds like she's trying desperately to relive those years, and basically say that you're not the only one who DESERVES that joy. \nThisnis the kind of mentality that can also lead to her being inappropriate with your partners, because she feels she must explore everything you're doing, to feel like she isn't missing out a second time. \n\nShe might need some therapy to help her adapt to being the age she actually is, and to separate her own identity from yours. Wearing your clothes and hanging out with your friends make it seem like she has a strange self concept. \n\nDoes she have friends her own age? Hobbies that she does on her own without you?", "NTA - deep down she knows she is too old but was holding on to the narrative she told herself that your friends liked hanging out with her and you were jealous\u2026 your Dad knows what\u2019s going on\u2026", "Your mother is 40.\n\nShe looks good for her age.\n\nShe could have asked to join you instead of putting on a dress of yours without asking.\n\nYou could have told her you wanted to celebrate with just your girls.\n\nSeems your mom has some difficulties hitting the 40.\n\nSeems she wants to fit into your friend group.\n\nThat's weird.\n\nYou should address this and talk about it.\n\nBut telling her she's TOO old, in front of others, is just bullying mean.\n\nESH\n\nFYI 40 is NOT TOO OLD to go clubbing.\n\nETA: As she had you at such a young age, did she have the opportunity to go out clubbing when she was around your age?\n\nINFO: Do you think it's possible your mom realised she missed out on this and is trying to catch up now?", "NTA.\n\n\u2026she is *too old\u2026", "ESH... for calling her too old. NOT for wanting some activities without her. Time to speak kindly to her about having times with just your group of friends. \n\nI live in the same building as my mom. We have together activities and separate ones. When I host a dinner, she isnt always invited and she doesnt always accept Invitations.", "Yea, that definitely doesn't sound right. She clearly didn't get the memo about her age. She needs to understand your boundaries and respect them, otherwise it'll just make things worse for everyone involved.", "NTA. Your mom is being oblivious and creepy.", "NTA, but if this is new behavior from your mom there is something deeper going on. This is not normal healthy behavior from a mother to her daughter. If you have had a normal loving mother-daughter relationship in the past I think you need to find out what is going on. Is it the cliche mid life crisis, or is she trying too hard to connect with a daughter who is growing up? Or is it something deeper?", "From the sound of it, she had you when she was 17, considering that she's still in your life, and you don't seem to really resent her, she probably did a lot of things right in your upbringing. With that said, as others have pointed out, she probably missed out on a lot of the things you are doing right now and looking to capture a bit of that. And at your age, hanging out with your mom at some hip/trendy spot probably isn't your idea of a good time, so what you said to her is probably a bit asshole-ish, but I'm guessing she's finding it hard to approach you on how to navigate her own newly found freedom\n\nNAH", " ESH\n\n40 isn't old and it's not too old to go to a club. I'm 46 and I'd go to one if I liked that kind of thing (never been a party animal). I think you're being quite mean and ageist.\n\nYes, talking about your dad, I'm presuming in a sexual way is gross and by all means tell her not to do it and if you want time alone with your friends and you don't want her to borrow your clothes, you could have communicated that before you got so mad you blew up at her.\n\nI was a teen mum like her and as my children got older I saw them more like sisters than daughters. I have a 4 year old and I sometimes slip up and call his sisters 'aunties' because of the huge age gap. There's a smaller age gap between me and my daughter's than them and their brother.  I hope to be as much as a friend as I can to my daughter's and when they visit, we go shopping and eat out and stuff like I would with my friends, so I see where your mum is coming from.\n\nI'd talk to her. Tell her you love her and you're sorry but also that you and your friends like time alone, you don't want her to talk about your dad and you'd rather she not wear your stuff but you can still go out sometimes as long as she clears it with you first. Maybe suggest you go girly shopping together and pick out some new outfits for both of you so she can still feel beautiful when you go out together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to go out and feel young again, but it is inappropriate for your mom to force her way into your friend group of early 20-something\u2019s and make your friends uncomfortable by showing up, wearing your clothes, and trying to speak as though they are peers. \n\nYour mom is embarrassed for getting called out and clearly in her feelings about \u201cmissing out\u201d on her youth / growing older.

I'm older than your mother, but I'm in my forties too. Your mother is being wildly inappropriate. It'd be fine if she wanted to go to a club with her friends or your dad but to try to party with your friends like that is weird. What's next, she'll flirt with your guy friends or guys your age? She is middle-aged and she needs to accept that wearing a twenty-three-year-old's clothes and partying with twenty somethings won't make her any younger.
