Me (38M) and my wife Alice (37F) have been together for 7 years. We have a couple of twins (both 6M) and we\u2019re a very happy family. My wife also has a son, Luke (19M). He got an athletic college scholarship but he dropped out and he\u2019s currently pursuing a \u201ccareer\u201d as a musician in another city. He stays in our home whenever he visits for holidays or vacations.\n\n  \nLuke's very tall so it is difficult for him to go unnoticed. When I say revealing clothes I mean that he wears thigh shorts, so tight you can see his boxers, crop tops, women blouses... I mean, it is very distracting as his pubes and trail are very visible. One time I catched him wearing a skirt while watching TV in our living room. I gave him a disapproving look and all he said to me was \u201cman you know we\u2019re irish, don\u2019t you?\u201d... which is a crazy thing to say, and I think kilts are from Scotland anyway, but that\u2019s not the point. In another instance, he would sit for dinner with a pearl necklace, eyeshadow and a fur coat\u2026 for example, my mother and sisters and their kids visited us for Chrstimas and they agreed that it was odd to have a guy dressing like that around the house. Especially in front of so many women\u2026\n\n  \nA few weeks ago after Christmas\u2019 dinner, I talked to Luke and voiced my concerns, and he was like \u201cokay cap\u2019 no problem\u201d and \u201cOkay sir! Yes sir! copy that sir' ' clearly mocking me\u2026 I must admit I got angry and I yelled at him, I went to vent out my frustration with my wife. However, she didn\u2019t back me up or take me seriously, even when I raised my concerns about our boys seeing his older brother acting a fool.\n\nI checked her phone and she was texting with Luke, again just joking and making fun of me. Luke texted her something like \u201cNot your husband body shaming me LOL I didn\u2019t get the hugo-boss dresscode memo\u201d and my wife replied \u201cFollow the dresscode young man or you\u2019ll be executed at midnight I don\u2019t make the rules babe I\u2019m sorry xx\u201d. \n\n  \nI got so mad I gave both of them the silent treatment for the rest of the holidays. Alice tried to talk me down by saying that he\u2019s not wearing anything around the house he wouldn\u2019t be wearing in public, so our boys would be seeing that \u201cstyle\u201d sooner or later whether we liked it or not. She was condescending, like she was talking to an angry old man from another century. \n\n  \nI don\u2019t know.... I don\u2019t feel like I was asking something unreasonable and I felt they were bullying me for expressing a reasonable concern about what my twins and my family are seeing in their own home. Our home. My home. And at the end of the day, it is my house, my rules too\u2026. AITA?  \n**TLDR:** I asked my wife\u2019s son to dress more properly in my house and he mocked me and my concerns. My wife didn\u2019t back me up and made fun of me.", "created_utc": 1675263847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qwvbt/aita_for_calling_out_my_wifes_adult_son_to_stop/", "score": 1320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mentioned having an issue with him showing a lot of skin, which, fine, I guess. But then you mentioned eyeshadow and a fur coat separately? I'm baffled. What's wrong with eyeshadow and a fur coat? There must be some cultural context I don't understand. Fur coats cover a lot of skin since they're made of fur, and eyeshadow also technically covers the skin. Does your wife not wear makeup or something?

You sound exactly like the definition of toxic masculinity.", "YTA - It sounds like you have more issues with the fact he\u2019s wearing traditionally female clothing than anything else.

If anything, it will make them more empathic to those who are different than them and that\u2019s a good thing.

Of course pubes shouldn't be on display, but given the rest of your diatribe I get the feeling you're an unreliable narrator.    \n\n\nYou also have some not-at-all-veiled homophobia and similar going on.   \n\n\nAs long as all his bits and pieces are under clothing, you need to sort yourself out and stop worrying about someone else's body.", "YTA for the comments about his outfits and the comments about his body cross the line even more. Stop being so fixated on what he wears and ruining his visits with his mom.", "YTA\n\nAside from shorts so tight you can see his underwear, which is debatable, I don't really see the problem here. It sounds like he's just feminine and you dislike that he wear's \"women's\" clothes. Who cares if he wears a skirt? Men used to wear skirts all the time. He makes a great point about being Irish, because people are totally fine with kilts even though those are just skirts too.", "YTA. While it's reasonable to ask someone to be covered up and not have their pubes hanging out at the dinner table, that's not what this is about. He has a sense of style that goes counter to what you think a man should wear. Which, really, has only been what men wear for the past 200 years or so. There's hundreds of years that western men wore skirts and makeup (I assume you're western).  Also if you missed the Hugo boss comment, he designed N\\*zi uniforms. \n\nAlso, there absolutely are Irish kilts. If you need some references on the history of men's clothing, I can send you some titles. (and yes, I'm using the gender binary- There was no comment of the step son being queer, and many cis/straight men are embracing more \"feminine\" looks).", "YTA - it's just clothes. And he's right, you are body-shaming him. I don't know your stepson, but the first thing we should instill in any child is to love yourself. If this is what he truly likes, then telling him to conform is going to damage any and all relationship you have with him. Something tells me that he's at least partly doing this for shock value. Your children are seeing someone who is not afraid to be themselves. That's a good thing to see.\n\nAnd I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you do sound like an angry old man from another century. This could be a phase, or maybe it's not. Whatever it is, if it's not harming you, your family, or your stepson, let it ride its course and accept that not everyone fits into the mold you think they should squeeze into.", "YTA\n\nFirst, the way you put \"career\" in quotes and referred to him as your wife's son makes me feel like you have a general disdain for your stepson and his life choices.\n\nIt seems like you tied together your stepson wearing short shorts and traditionally feminine clothing together to hone in on your point and get people on your side. It didn't work. If he's happy expressing himself in a more 'feminine' way he should be completely allowed to.  If you walked into his home and he required you to wear booty shorts and neon pink crop tops because \"it's his house, his rules\" you wouldn't be happy about it either would you?\n\nHonestly, this comes off as bigoted and controlling.", "YTA and oh boy, for multiple reasons, first ; \"My wife's adult son\" he's 19yo only, you can straight up say you don't like your step child\n\nSecond ; You're shaming your step child because he's not wearing traditional outfits and most of all, he's wearing OH MY GOD, FEMININE OUTFITS !!! You just sounds like one of those conservatives right wings that are shocked a guy can wear a skirt (which you are since you literally were giving him a bad look because he was wearing a skirt). You also put \"style\" in quotes, which I guess you don't agree that it's a style ? I don't even want to hear you stance on drag queens sheesh.\n\nThird ; \"even when I raised my concerns about our boys seeing his older brother acting a fool.\" what is foolish ? Wearing outfits he likes ? You're an incredible asshole, I hope you're boys have traditional style just to not get a headache from you being mad at them for wearing whatever they feel comfy in.\n\nFinally ; \"She was condescending, like she was talking to an angry old man from another century.\" it's because you are an angry old man from another century, at least you act like it, you yelled at him because he responded jokingly to a grown ass man telling him to dress up differently because it would offend his family ffs, when all he does is wearing out of the norm outfits but he's not fricking naked around the house", "YTA. Why are you so concerned about what he wears?", "YTA\n\nYou're conflating different things.\n\nFirst is the question of whether he is adequately clad in your house. It is reasonable to not want him sitting around your house with his meat-and-two-veg hanging out. That's a standard community norm everywhere unless you're a naturist.\n\nSecond is the question of his choice of clothing. You quite clearly don't like him wearing clothes that aren't traditionally male. And this makes you an AH. You are \"concerned\" about your twins and family seeing Luke in traditionally-female items of clothing. This is homophobic.\n\nAnd no, it's not \"your house, your rules\".  You and your wife share the home. You are not the boss, and this statement makes you an AH, this time because of your patriarchal misogyny.", "ESH - I think it\u2019s important you all sit down and have an adult conversation. Explain what bothers you, but it is important to accept that he wants to dress non-gender. Like if he wears things as tight as seeing pubes (though I suspect this is an overly exaggeration) you can discuss why it bothers you. \n\nMost important: mockery, checking peoples phones and conversations, and silent treatment is not an adult way of communicating.", "You do not have a happy family.

The world is changing buddy, so get with the program or get left behind.", "YTA. Obviously more about his wearing feminine clothing rather than revealing clothing. Hair in itself is not the measure of impropriety you seem to be arguing it is. \n\nHigh heels were originally worn by men in the military. Fashion changes. All. The. Time. Pink was a masculine color. \n\nMore importantly, gossip with your mom all you want: You are entitled to your opinions. You are not in control of how your fixation changes how your wife views you.

But so what?\n\nYou're fighting a losing battle. Your wife doesn't care, he's under no obligation to change anything, and your concerns over what your younger kids see are pretty unfounded. \n\nYTA I'm afraid. You've just got to get past it.

There\u2019s no real downside, and if there is, the natural consequences are enough to \u201ccorrect\u201d any truly inappropriate behavior for a normal kid with his level of good social skills. He knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019ll be fine.\n\nAs for your own kids. Being exposed to a variety of types of expression is good for kids. They\u2019ll grow to like what they like, whether or not you try to control what they\u2019re exposed to. That\u2019s a losing battle in the end. So what if they decide the teen wearing fun clothes is cool? Again, the world does a pretty good job of enforcing natural social consequences without parents adding on to any issues. Let your own kids dress how they want (within dress code and legal limits obviously) and if, say, they get teased at school (genuinely this is the worst it could get!) it\u2019ll be up to them to decide whether to dress differently or not, not you.

Me (38M) and my wife Alice (37F) have been together for 7 years. We have a couple of twins (both 6M) and we\u2019re a very happy family. My wife also has a son, Luke (19M). He got an athletic college scholarship but he dropped out and he\u2019s currently pursuing a \u201ccareer\u201d as a musician in another city. He stays in our home whenever he visits for holidays or vacations.\n\n  \nLuke's very tall so it is difficult for him to go unnoticed. When I say revealing clothes I mean that he wears thigh shorts, so tight you can see his boxers, crop tops, women blouses... I mean, it is very distracting as his pubes and trail are very visible. One time I catched him wearing a skirt while watching TV in our living room. I gave him a disapproving look and all he said to me was \u201cman you know we\u2019re irish, don\u2019t you?\u201d... which is a crazy thing to say, and I think kilts are from Scotland anyway, but that\u2019s not the point. In another instance, he would sit for dinner with a pearl necklace, eyeshadow and a fur coat\u2026 for example, my mother and sisters and their kids visited us for Chrstimas and they agreed that it was odd to have a guy dressing like that around the house. Especially in front of so many women\u2026\n\n  \nA few weeks ago after Christmas\u2019 dinner, I talked to Luke and voiced my concerns, and he was like \u201cokay cap\u2019 no problem\u201d and \u201cOkay sir! Yes sir! copy that sir' ' clearly mocking me\u2026 I must admit I got angry and I yelled at him, I went to vent out my frustration with my wife. However, she didn\u2019t back me up or take me seriously, even when I raised my concerns about our boys seeing his older brother acting a fool.\n\nI checked her phone and she was texting with Luke, again just joking and making fun of me. Luke texted her something like \u201cNot your husband body shaming me LOL I didn\u2019t get the hugo-boss dresscode memo\u201d and my wife replied \u201cFollow the dresscode young man or you\u2019ll be executed at midnight I don\u2019t make the rules babe I\u2019m sorry xx\u201d. \n\n  \nI got so mad I gave both of them the silent treatment for the rest of the holidays. Alice tried to talk me down by saying that he\u2019s not wearing anything around the house he wouldn\u2019t be wearing in public, so our boys would be seeing that \u201cstyle\u201d sooner or later whether we liked it or not. She was condescending, like she was talking to an angry old man from another century. \n\n  \nI don\u2019t know.... I don\u2019t feel like I was asking something unreasonable and I felt they were bullying me for expressing a reasonable concern about what my twins and my family are seeing in their own home. Our home. My home. And at the end of the day, it is my house, my rules too\u2026. AITA?  \n**TLDR:** I asked my wife\u2019s son to dress more properly in my house and he mocked me and my concerns. My wife didn\u2019t back me up and made fun of me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's insane that people on here feel that a GUEST in your home gets to dictate to you the HOST how they will dress especially if it makes you uncomfortable.
