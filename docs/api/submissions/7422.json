I've been married for two years to my wife (35f), our relationship has its ups and downs, but we get our way and always improve. My son recently graduated in IT engineering, I am very proud that he got his degree at such a young age. currently he lives with me but stays with his mother when he goes to visit his girlfriend. Me and his mom agreed to buy him an apartment as a gift since he can't have a graduation party, but my wives didn't like the idea because \"An IT engineer earns enough to buy his own apartment\", i didn't said nothing and i will pay for half of the apartment. \n\nReturning to the subject of the post. Recently my son said he wanted to break some big news, but he made it clear that he only wanted me and his mom. My ex's current husband wouldn't go either, according to him it would just be me, her and a few people. \n\nWhen the day arrived, I went to my ex's house and took her in my car, as hers was undergoing maintenance. When we arrived there were my son, his girlfriend and her family. They announced that they were getting married and that they were expecting a baby boy. I jumped with joy and pride in my son and his girlfriend. The girl is the sweetest person i seen, she worked since she was 12 braiding hair to help her family and now work in a comic book company as a cartoonist, she was a very hard working person. I'm really happy for them. \n\nLater that day my wife found out about the meeting and yelled at me saying that I had excluded her from this experience and that I should have taken her even though she didn't get along very well with my son. I explained to her that I didn't know it would be such big news and that I thought it was something small and wouldn't make a difference. She said that I hurt her feelings and that she will only talk to me again if my son and I apologize for it. \n\nIt's important to say that the main reason my son doesn't want my wife there is because, according to him, she makes racist comments about his girlfriend's appearance. Stuff like her hair (she always has braids which are really nice by the way) and her makeup (even without makeup she is very pretty, she has green eyes which are very beautiful). I tried to explain that if she wanted to be invited, she should try to have a better relationship with my son, but she didn't listen and said that I made him be more attached to his mother than trying to give her a chance to be a important part of his life too. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nInfo: My wife is white and my future DIL is black. some people still don't understand.", "created_utc": 1673805941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cqd60/aita_for_taking_my_ex_to_a_family_gathering/", "score": 464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
