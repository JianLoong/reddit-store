All of your possessions are gone (sold, destroyed, or gifted to a liar), and never to be replaced. She could start there by replacing EVERYTHING, but she won\u2019t. You might get some, but you\u2019ll never get the sentimental things back. \n\nSpeaking of the liar - has she faced any *meaningful* consequences? I mean, you lost all of your material possessions based allegations and zero evidence. One would think with actual proof you have that Lexi lied, they would *do* something. I\u2019m sure Lexi felt zero guilt watching your mom clear out your stuff based on her word alone. \n\nThen there\u2019s your mom. Talk about a nuclear reaction. Based on Lexi\u2019s words alone, your mom 100% believed you were an \u201cevil\u201d monster and went scorched earth. Like she birthed you, raised you your whole life, but someone she\u2019s known a *fraction* of that time says the word and you\u2019re just dead to her? And she thinks she\u2019s somehow going to replace the trust she just threw away?\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Your terms to her are clear, but so is the underlying message. You don\u2019t really plan to ever reconcile, because you don\u2019t believe she\u2019ll do what it takes to earn you back. It\u2019s telling that she considers *you* cruel to ask of her the same that she did to you.", "NTA\n\nYou should probably tell your mom that you don't feel safe in her home, and that she needs to see a professional to figure out why she is prioritizing one child over another to the point of causing harm.", "NTA.  \n\nIt sounds like being at your dad's is the safest and best situation for you, with limited and/or supervised visits with your mother, maybe family counseling.\n\nAlso, your father needs to get child support ordered from your mother for this new arrangement.", "NTA. Your mom is nuts. Don\u2019t think I\u2019d forgive her", "NTA, Your mom's mental breakdown happened when She imposed a brutal punishment without any real evidence.", "NTA. It may seem cold to people hearing it secondhand, but what she did was so absurdly cruel and dismissive. Like worse than a cartoon villain. \n\nAnd now you're still the bad guy? Because your mom wanted forgiveness she has not earned and is not entitled to? Was anyone pissed at her for treating you that way?", "NTA. If I could hug you I would. There is so much to unpack here. Do not feel like you have to forgive people before you are ready. What your mother and step sister did was horrible. I understand your step sister is going through something and needs professional help. However that only explains her actions, it doesn\u2019t excuse them. Actions have consequences and your step sister needs to understand that. \n\nYour mother is another conversation. Can I just say I am so deeply sorry you went through this? Parents are supposed to be your biggest advocate. They raised you, they should know what you would and would not do. To disregard that and take the word of someone else without even hearing your side is heartbreaking. On top of that she went and doled out a punishment without allowing you to defend yourself. I mean seriously what is this, the Salem witch trials? \n\nShe\u2019s also being hypocritical. She claimed you were a bully and her only solution was to go on a power trip. Now that she realizes she was wrong she decides to use manipulative methods to get you to forgive her (like a bully). According to her logic, bullies need to be taught a lesson where it hurts. Only then is \u201cjustice\u201d served. \n\nYour response seems more than reasonable considering the circumstances. I would maybe consider writing your mother a letter detailing your feelings. That way you can keep your distance (if you want it) and avoid her when she tries to manipulate you again. Explain that her actions hurt you so deeply because she failed you as a mother (extreme but true). You are extending an olive branch by allowing her to prove her remorse by using her own method. If she chooses to disregard your olive branch you will know 1. She values other people\u2019s words above your own (even when they are slanderous) and 2. She does not feel remorse and sees nothing wrong with her actions. If this is too extreme for her fine, pull out that checkbook and be ready to replace everything (good luck with the sentimental items). Explain that only then will you know she understands how much she hurt you. Trust is built in drops but lost in buckets.\n\nAgain, I am so sorry this happened to you. I wish you the best of luck.", "NTA. \n\nCall the cops. \n\nI'll say it again: CALL THE POLICE. For theft. Your mother stole your stuff. \n\nYour mom isn't having a mental breakdown, she's playing victim to avoid accountability; don't let her. Her whole side is going to think you're the bad guy anyways and they sound irredeemable so block em all.", "Your last sentence, \u2018mom having a mental breakdown\u2019 makes me wonder about your mom, it sounds like she may have been breaking down for some time now.  Would you say she\u2019s gotten worse?  Has she always been like this?  \n\nBecause it\u2019s not normal at all for her to behave the way you\u2019re describing.  \n\nYou should probably have a heart to heart with your dad(?) or moms fianc\u00e9 (?) and find out if your mom is getting help, if the answer is no, definitely do not go back, she needs therapy.\n\nNTA she does not sound stable at all.", "Wow. I don't know how you come back from that. Mom totally and completely through you under the bus, the tractor trailer and the train! All on the say-so of someone else when she hadn't even verified the story. And she has the nerve to call you childish and cruel? Wow!\n\nYou are NTA. I wouldn't be visiting her for a while. Like several decades. Same goes for the asshats blaming you for your mom's \"breakdown\". They can all go and suck rotten eggs.", "NTA", "Thats not your mom anymore. Thats lexis mom. Cut your losses and wish her the best. NTA.", "ESH. Yes, your mum is definitely the A. But you should have just told her no rather than demand she throws away all her stuff. She's an A and you want to sink to her level?", "NTA. Has your mother even offered to give you the money from what she sold of yours or try and replace the things she threw away? She stole from you and has in no way tried to make anything right. She can ugly cry all she wants. She knew what she was doing was wrong when she did it. Why hasn't she punished Lexi for lying? Did she throw all of her things out? Point all that out to her and make it clear until you get your things back and she actually makes Lexi take responsibility for flat out lying, she can kick rocks. Inform mom's side of the family of the same.", "NTA. You could call the police and get her in trouble for theft and destruction of property. Not sure if that\u2019s the correct term, but surely you could get your revenge by getting her in trouble.", "NTA, cut your mom and sister off permanently, you don\u2019t need people like that in your life.", "NTA your mom didn't even talk to you before she did this that's unimaginably cruel.", "NTA- turnabouts fair play.  Your mom did a horrible thing.  She didn't even give you a chance.  She was ready to leave the absolute worst of you.\n\nSo she should not be surprised when you are ready to leave the worst of her.  She sold your belongings and threw the rest away.  I know you lost things that you can never get back.  \n\nI'm sorry that happened to you.\n\nIf you want your meet your mother again, I would suggest therapy as a ground start with for the two of you.  Before anything else.\n\nBut I also recommend waiting until after the wedding.  Likely she wants \"happy family\" appearances.", "You're all fucked.  The whole family.  Fucked.  (Maybe not your dad?)", "I am sorry that happened to you. The trauma that both your mother and Lexi went through does not excuse their behavior and they should both be in therapy. You seem to be extremely compassionate in your responses but do not owe them anything. What your mother did is completely unacceptable and I think you should keep your guard up. Others not holding either of them accountable isn\u2019t helping either of them and they could benefit from some accountability. It\u2019s ok to say I love you and might be able to forgive you in time, but what you did was a huge violation of trust and respect in our relationship and it is going to take a lot of time and action to rebuild the relationship that we had. It sounds like you love your mom but healthy boundaries are a good thing and it\u2019s important for you to protect yourself and to recognize your worth and value and you deserve better. \u2764\ufe0f", "The fact that she sold a good deal of OP's stuff...before a WEDDING, makes me believe she was going to do it all along, and used the accusations as an excuse and never really believed any of it.", "NTA! Your mom didn\u2019t even bother asking you about it before just believing the worst. You\u2019re her daughter and she should have talked to you before deciding to punish you, especially in such an irreversible, irresponsible, and extreme way. She didn\u2019t even bother to look for proof. If she knew Lexi was having mental issues she should have taken that into account before getting rid of your stuff. I\u2019d tell your mom and her side of the family, after telling the family the whole story because I doubt they were told the whole truth, \u201cOk Mom doesn\u2019t have to get rid of all of her stuff, you\u2019re right that\u2019s cruel just like she was cruel.
