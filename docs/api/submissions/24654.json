All of your possessions are gone (sold, destroyed, or gifted to a liar), and never to be replaced. She could start there by replacing EVERYTHING, but she won\u2019t. You might get some, but you\u2019ll never get the sentimental things back. \n\nSpeaking of the liar - has she faced any *meaningful* consequences? I mean, you lost all of your material possessions based allegations and zero evidence. One would think with actual proof you have that Lexi lied, they would *do* something. I\u2019m sure Lexi felt zero guilt watching your mom clear out your stuff based on her word alone. \n\nThen there\u2019s your mom. Talk about a nuclear reaction. Based on Lexi\u2019s words alone, your mom 100% believed you were an \u201cevil\u201d monster and went scorched earth. Like she birthed you, raised you your whole life, but someone she\u2019s known a *fraction* of that time says the word and you\u2019re just dead to her?

You don\u2019t really plan to ever reconcile, because you don\u2019t believe she\u2019ll do what it takes to earn you back. It\u2019s telling that she considers *you* cruel to ask of her the same that she did to you.", "NTA\n\nYou should probably tell your mom that you don't feel safe in her home, and that she needs to see a professional to figure out why she is prioritizing one child over another to the point of causing harm.", "NTA.  \n\nIt sounds like being at your dad's is the safest and best situation for you, with limited and/or supervised visits with your mother, maybe family counseling.\n\nAlso, your father needs to get child support ordered from your mother for this new arrangement.", "NTA. Your mom is nuts. Don\u2019t think I\u2019d forgive her", "NTA, Your mom's mental breakdown happened when She imposed a brutal punishment without any real evidence.", "NTA. It may seem cold to people hearing it secondhand, but what she did was so absurdly cruel and dismissive. Like worse than a cartoon villain. \n\nAnd now you're still the bad guy? Because your mom wanted forgiveness she has not earned and is not entitled to? Was anyone pissed at her for treating you that way?", "NTA. If I could hug you I would. There is so much to unpack here. Do not feel like you have to forgive people before you are ready. What your mother and step sister did was horrible. I understand your step sister is going through something and needs professional help. However that only explains her actions, it doesn\u2019t excuse them. Actions have consequences and your step sister needs to understand that. \n\nYour mother is another conversation. Can I just say I am so deeply sorry you went through this? Parents are supposed to be your biggest advocate. They raised you, they should know what you would and would not do. To disregard that and take the word of someone else without even hearing your side is heartbreaking. On top of that she went and doled out a punishment without allowing you to defend yourself. I mean seriously what is this, the Salem witch trials? \n\nShe\u2019s also being hypocritical. She claimed you were a bully and her only solution was to go on a power trip. Now that she realizes she was wrong she decides to use manipulative methods to get you to forgive her (like a bully). According to her logic, bullies need to be taught a lesson where it hurts. Only then is \u201cjustice\u201d served. \n\nYour response seems more than reasonable considering the circumstances. I would maybe consider writing your mother a letter detailing your feelings. That way you can keep your distance (if you want it) and avoid her when she tries to manipulate you again. Explain that her actions hurt you so deeply because she failed you as a mother (extreme but true). You are extending an olive branch by allowing her to prove her remorse by using her own method. If she chooses to disregard your olive branch you will know 1. She values other people\u2019s words above your own (even when they are slanderous) and 2. She does not feel remorse and sees nothing wrong with her actions. If this is too extreme for her fine, pull out that checkbook and be ready to replace everything (good luck with the sentimental items). Explain that only then will you know she understands how much she hurt you. Trust is built in drops but lost in buckets.\n\nAgain, I am so sorry this happened to you. I wish you the best of luck.", "NTA. \n\nCall the cops. \n\nI'll say it again: CALL THE POLICE. For theft.

Would you say she\u2019s gotten worse?  Has she always been like this?  \n\nBecause it\u2019s not normal at all for her to behave the way you\u2019re describing.  \n\nYou should probably have a heart to heart with your dad(?) or moms fianc\u00e9 (?) and find out if your mom is getting help, if the answer is no, definitely do not go back, she needs therapy.\n\nNTA she does not sound stable at all.", "Wow. I don't know how you come back from that. Mom totally and completely through you under the bus, the tractor trailer and the train!

Others not holding either of them accountable isn\u2019t helping either of them and they could benefit from some accountability. It\u2019s ok to say I love you and might be able to forgive you in time, but what you did was a huge violation of trust and respect in our relationship and it is going to take a lot of time and action to rebuild the relationship that we had.

Even if you just decided that everything was forgiven, she still clearly has a lot of shit she needs to work through in order to figure out why the approval of Lexi was so important that she would hurt you like this.  \n\nYou don't actually have to forgive her or Lexi anytime soon, and unless there is anything more moving than crocodile tears, I wouldn't until she actually gets help and understands why what she did was wrong, why it hurt you for your own mother to act like that, and how to move forward with *earning* back your forgiveness. This isn't the type of thing you just slide under the rug and forget about, because she showed you where and with whom her priorities lie.  \n\nThere was nothing wrong with asking that Lexi face more consequences than the discomfort of a strained relationship, and the fact that asking her to throw away her own items was unthinkable....well, doesn't that say something on its own?", "NTA. They want to apologize. Cool. How about repairing the damage they did? How about changing their behavior? Forgiveness isn't earned by apologizing, but by making amends and being better.

There's nothing else for you to do. The ball is in her court.\n\nThe thing is, even if your mom did go through with your terms for forgiveness, it wouldn't matter. There is no way to make up for what she did. Selling material things will not heal the hurt she caused you, restore your trust in her, or repair your relationship. Only time and her continued change in behavior can do that, and it doesn't sound like she's capable of that right now. She has to take care of her own shit right now, and you have to do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If that means going low or no contact with her, then so be it.

THE FACT THAT I HAD LOST MY MOTHER WAS NEVER ALLOWED AS AN EXCUSE FOR MY BEHAVIOUR even when my cousin stole one of my mums belongings from my bedroom amd I went ape.\n\nI am telling you this because you have every right to feel the way you do, and DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IS ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE THEY LOST A PARENT. If it was a valid excuse, there would be a lot more criminals on the streets because Lexi isn't the first person who has lost their parent as a kid and grown up to do stupid things, and if this isn't nipped in the bud now, she is only going to get more entitled and manipulative, or worse, she is going to get herself or someone else hurt because of something she has said.", "Look, I get all that and that's fine.
