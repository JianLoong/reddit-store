It was the same with my closet and bathroom literally just the bare essentials so freaked out I went looking for my mom.\nshe were sitting at the kitchen table silent for a moment before she told me to sit down we had to have a conversation Well apparently she sold a lot of my stuff and anything that she couldn\u2019t sell she threw away. I screamed at why the fuck would she do that she screamed back at me to shut my evil mouth and my punishment hadn\u2019t even began due to my cruel bullying and slut shaming.\n\n\nI was confused and asked her repeat herself because I hadn\u2019t bullied anyone, apparently a girl who I used to be close friends Cassie (all fake names)  was being badly bullied for being pregnant by my friend group to the point she made a tiktok exposing what was going on. Now I saw her posts myself no were did it mention me it was mostly about her ex best friend maddie and maddies boyfriend so I asked my mom were do I fit into this. So apparently my step sister lexi told her I was involved and she\u2019d heard Cassie mention me even witnessed the bullying herself \n\nSo I told her get boyfriend and his daughter so we can prove it out because i distance myself from BOTH girls and most of that friend group months ago because of all the drama even before Cassie got pregnant. Lexi was away with her dad conveniently\n\n So I said ok if that what she wants to believe I\u2019d apologise to Cassie but my dad also had to be there and big shock when I went to Cassie\u2019s house Cassie said I didn\u2019t do anything to her. I went back to my dads house and haven\u2019t spoke to my mom since \n\nWell today she showed and begged me to talk to her how I was her daughter and she loved me . I asked her what about her new daughter lexi she said lexi was struggling with her mental health back than and was looking for attention but she\u2019s doing better now and feels really guilty she also wants to apologise face to face \n\n\nI said ok I\u2019ll go back if she throws out everything she owned even her wedding dress (she\u2019s getting married in September) she looked shocked and told me she knew what she did was wrong and she\u2019ll forever try to make up for it the rest of her life but what I was asking was childish and cruel \n\nI just stared out her and than she started ugly crying so I walked away, I heard her and my dad talk for while before she left now moms side is all pissed off at me because my moms having a mental break down", "created_utc": 1692049758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r899t/aita_for_telling_my_throw_away_all_her_stuff/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom stole your stuff, sold it, or threw it out based on a hearsay accusation. Never asked you about it, just assumed you were guilty. Refused to even consider you might be telling the truth when you denied the accusation. So now she wants back in your good graces. You put a very reasonable price on doing so. She refused. If she is having a breakdown (which I doubt) she brought it on herself. You have no fault in the matter.", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing Lexi\u2019s punishment for what she actually did is far less than yours was for something you didn\u2019t even do. Stay with your dad. Your mom doesn\u2019t deserve to have you in her life anymore.", "TL/DR version: mom believed lies bf's daughter told, and threw away your things as punishment without talking to you. She found out she was wrong, made excuses for Lexi, and expects you to let it all go. \n\nYou are not responsible for your mother's mental health. She is. \n\nNTA and you should stay with your dad no matter what she says. She can't make it up to you and she can't be trusted. Everyone at that house sounds manipulative with mental issues.", "NTA\n\nMom needs to work through her own issues.  You should stay with your Dad where you have stability and support.", "Go NC with your Mom. Stay with your Dad. NTA.", "NTA. There's no excuse for what your Mom did. She owes you the money she made from the sale from your property at the very least.", "NTA. Maybe Lexi should also throw away all her possessions.\n\nEDIT: \"Childish and cruel\" - well, your mother has some insight into what she did after all, doesn't she?\n\nAnd she also owes you the money she got from selling your stuff.", "NTA\n\nStay with dad", "NTA. Just stick tight with your dad, and tell her side of the family who are mad at you what she did and how she accused and punished you on lies told by Lexi. How she threw all of your things away. Now she knows the truth but the damage has been done as she has shown that her love is only conditional.", "NTA OP, please stand your ground on this matter. She was wrong and she needs to face the consequences.", "NTA-your mom did that to you without even trying discussing what happened with you. You don\u2019t owe her anything.   I would stay with your dad. It seems that it would be best for you.", "NTA - So your mom, based on what her stepdaughter said, and without verifying it, sells or tosses all the stuff you had at her house? And they have not even compensated you for everything yet? And her side of the family is pissed at YOU? Do they even know the whole story?\n\nI think maybe you should take a long break from your mom and her entire extended family, including the wedding. Sometimes people need to face the harsh reality of their actions to strive to be better people. Though I don't hold out much hope for your mom.", "INFO : did anyone - either your mother or her lying \u2018new daughter\u2019 start replacing all your possessions or reimbursing you so you can replace them?Or was it all just \u2018oops, my bad\u2019?", "NTA. if your dad is a decent human being just stay with him and go NC or at least LC with your mother. Throwing away all your things without even getting your side of the story is unhinged. Even if you did take part in the bullying, there are other way more appropriate punishments but good for you for already distancing yourselves from the bullies. Just tell your mom to go treat her new stepdaughter like how she treated you", "First she replaces your spa trip then replaces everything she sold or gives you the money to replace your items and keep in mind she sold your stuff used it will take a whole lot more money to replace it.
