I might not have much money, but by George,  my child at ANY age, from my 30 year old to my 15 year old, says they're hungry, I will cook up a pot of red beans and rice, .make some tuna casserol, SOMETHING. I just wanna adopt you right now.  This hurt to read.\n\nEdit: typo", "Depends. What\u2019s the reason you guys fell out of touch and you disowned him? Did he really fuck up that bad or is a situation wheee he didn\u2019t really do anything wrong but you just didn\u2019t agree with his decision? From an outside perspective. YTA. But who knows.", "You are the asshole!!! Regardless of what happened, your son is still your son. You should\u2019ve helped him because he needed help from you, period.", "Yeah in this case NTA\nop can tell him the money that was meant for your home went to a better use, raising your child [that is off OP was financially supporting his grandkid]", "I mean, OP was able to help his eldest two. Sounds like OP is financially well-off enough. I could be wrong though, but I do agree with your judgment.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that he did say he helped them pay *part* of their house costs, not entirely.", "Did you abandon your daughter though? /s\n\n(Son #3 had a baby and abandoned her, which is why OP disowned him and took care of granddaughter\u2019s costs and care).", "Uno reverse card Jesus Christ", "Well one one hand \nYou told him you didnt have money and then gave money to someone else, that is a d**kmove\n\nBut i do agree that he lost his chance when he was 22 if he was disowned for a reasonable reason.\nHowever to not help after reconciliation, that makes you seem a bit of an AH", "This is really critical info that you should add to the post. Since you didn't specify I assumed it was something like he came out and you were homophobic. \n\nNTA based on this info.", "This should have been in the original post. NTA because you were defending the innocent. It seems he\u2019s only come back to the relationship for money. \n\nMaybe set up a trust fund for your grandchild with the money you would have spent on 3\u2019s house. \n\nNo point in lying and saying you don\u2019t have the money when clearly you do. Just saw the money that would have been used for him has already been allocated.", "Thats a good reason to cut ties.", "NTA the reason matters", "I think you got the wrong post.", "Yep, and depending where you want to buy, it's possible without a down-payment. We were able to buy a house with 0% down and then rolled closing costs into the mortgage, too.", "If you\u2019re paying to raise his child for him, then as far as I\u2019m concerned, you ARE helping him financially as much as you\u2019re helping the other kids.  It may not be getting spent where he wants it to be, but he\u2019s definitely getting at least as much financial help as his siblings.", "Sounds like buying her a house at 22 is the way to go here. Your son made his decisions, now he has to deal with the consequences. He will be okay, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s about to be homeless, just needs to downsize.\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA then. Tell him that you have been spending the house money to pay his child support and that if he\u2019d been paying for his kid like he should\u2019ve been, that you might have the money to give him.", "If you\u2019ve paid to help raise his child when he couldn\u2019t be bothered, then tell him THAT is where his inheritance/financial help etc went instead. Too bad for him but fair - lucky granddaughter to have amazing grandparents. \u2764\ufe0f", "Are you going to help her with a house when she turns 22? That would push him over the edge. NTA", "You really should update your post to include this information, because as it reads, you definitely come across as TA. Knowing why you made the decisions you did \u2013 knowing what your son did \u2013 changes things completely.", "Then his house money rightfully went to support the child he abandoned. NTA", "I would tell your 3rd son that his house fund went into helping raise his kid he decided to abandon. You are open to having a relationship with him, but he will not be getting money for a house. His daughter is 15. He made that choice for himself 15 years ago.", "Well then if you're paying for everything then tell him that you spent all the money on your grandchild that he abandoned. That's where his money went. Tell him that.", "NTA.  His share is going towards supporting his child.", "Remind your son who is and has been paying fir the child he abandoned. That is where his financial help went.", "I find these terms acceptable.", "Sounds more like wouldn't do it rather than couldn't", "Oh well you don't get to be a awful parent then demand money from your parent", "WTF? They couldn't at the very least order a pizza to be delivered to your house? \n\nI'm sorry you got such awful parents.", "I wish I had been given a vehicle ! Honestly? I began plotting escape from my parents house when I was 13 ! I started buying dishes and pots and pans when I was 16 . I moved out when I was 17. I had a bike .", "So you did pay him money\u2026 by financially supporting what should have been his duty as a father. You should let him know that.", "I think fit behavior is not abandoning a child. I\u2019m sure anyone who is an actual barely decent human being would agree", "21 year olds mistakes are like grabbing a shit beer as your first drink not abandoning your fucking child.", "He didn't say he had no money. He said he didn't have the money to spare.  He didn't.  The money for the youngest was already set aside and couldn't be tapped. I see no lie.", "Op disowned him when he was 20, so he's probably about 35 now.", "Tell that to the abandoned grandchild and it\u2019s father", "He didn't get the money because he abandoned his child for almost 15 years and op had to help raise the child", "OP couldve afforded it, but now is supporting 3rd childs kid, as child 3 abandoned the kid without any support. so instead of giving a downpayment, OP is stepping up to make sure their grandkid has whats needed & is taken care of", "OP did - op\u2019s been financially supporting 3\u2019s kid (op\u2019s grandkid) for 15 years", "I got a large suitcase and a smaller suitcase."]}
