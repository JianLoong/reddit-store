Also, if kiddo is 15, then your third son must be quite... mature, at least in age. It's not your problem anymore.  \nedit: NTA", "Okay, NTA then. It was hard to tell from your original post though.", "I feel like you really needed to put this in the post...\n\nNTA", "Who said that op is raising his kid?", "You said you pay for everything. Spiteful mothers, IF that\u2019s what she is, aren\u2019t stupid about money. And you said the only reason you\u2019re now speaking to your son sometimes is because your granddaughter has decided SHE can tolerate her dad for a couple hours at a time. \n\nAnd to clarify further, I am not accusing mom of being spiteful, I used a real life example as an illustration of why I doubt the veracity of your story. ESPECIALLY, when your answer to why he would \u201cabandon\u201d his child was \u201cI don\u2019t care to know.\u201d \n\nBe honest. You wrote off this kid more than 15 years ago. This 3rd was expected to be your last right? #4 who is just now reaching 22 was the surprise? \n\nI think honestly you\u2019ve probably got repair work to do with your son that goes back much further than you think.", "Didn't say the son was likable. Thank  you for responding to an argument I never made.", "My oldest has already done something like this. They had a huge fight over it", "This is the way tbh.", "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Good for them.\n\nI think you should express the irony that this son wants free money from his parents when he wasn't even willing to provide money/care for his own child. Ask him if he plans on giving his daughter this money when she's 22.", "Nta sounds like you put his house money towards raising his child he abandoned. Sounds like you did help him financially, just not the way he wanted but how it was as needed,"]}
