He\u2019s abandoning the child, so he\u2019s therefore essentially forfeiting his rights. If he takes her to court for custody after doing this, the court will almost guaranteed side with the wife because that would be the best interest in the child.

It might be hard on the mom to be parted from her kid for such a long time (if she didn't want to go) but \"spending summers and holidays with dad/mom abroad\" isn't unheard of for international couples.", "Again, We don't know where he's from. It could be that the situation in their home country isn't the best and his best/only option to provide a better life for the kid is to go overseas.   \nFor example: I have a co-worker who is a mother of 2 and she hasn't see her kids in about 2 years. She's originally from the Philippines and she's here in Australia trying to get permanent residency so she can eventually bring her kids over for a better life.   \nI'm from the East Coast of Canada and a lot of men work \"Out West\" because the jobs simply pay more out there, but they'll be gone for weeks or months at a time.   \nI lived in Korea for six years and a lot of Korean companies have overseas branches. Some of my students' dads and husbands worked overseas for years.   \n\n\nYou could be right. But I'm seeing this as really normal (going to work overseas).", "In Michigan (at least in my parenting agreement) we aren\u2019t allowed to move more than 100 miles from the other household. I\u2019ll bet if both sides agree to a new parenting time schedule it would be fine though", "\"They need to draw up a new agreement\" that's what I'm saying. Sounds to me like the dad is trying to re-negotiate and the mother is just refusing everything instead of working with him to find a solution that suits everyone. It's also assuming a lot that the father would have no support system in place in his new country. He might not have family there, but he would likely have friends and resources. Who knows, maybe he actually has a better setup in the foreign country than they do in their home country. The fact that he's going abroad to work to better provide for his kid makes me think that their situation in their home country isn't the best?", "No thanks. \n\nI see people being very selective on what they choose to comprehend about the story.\n\nNoone is upset that she relegated him to two days a week with his kid. No one.\n\nNo one is mad that she won't even consider taking their child to him over the summer and went right to taking his parental rights away. No one.\n\nSo when you idiots learn to think a little more critically about ALL the information presented, I'll consider softening my words.", "An awful person is generally an awful person regardless of who they're around, that is just common sense. \n\nThe mum isn't here asking if she's the asshole, but OP is, hence people not scruitinising her as much as him. Not to mention, I think most people are genuinely trying to help OP avoid making this more of a mistake than it needs be.", "So he\u2019s gonna go from two days a week to not seeing him till JANUARY? Dad of the year right there.\n\nShe didn\u2019t decide anything. The judge did. If OP is making so much better money, why doesn\u2019t he go get visitation reassessed?", "Of course I\u2019ve never met her, and frankly - given that OP indicated there had been cheating on both sides leading to the divorce - I don\u2019t have any particular vision of her as a great person. But if OP chooses to move to another country, he doesn\u2019t have the right to assume she\u2019s willing and able to drop everything and travel overseas for weeks at a time so he can see the kid he left behind. He can ask, and in some families it might be a great, workable solution. But he\u2019s not entitled to it.", "The next time he\u2019s coming to visit the kid is in JANUARY. That is literally months away and missing out on a huge chunk of visitation voluntarily, so if definitely would put his visitation at risk.", "I wouldn\u2019t want to get dragged overseas to accommodate my exes career choices either. Most wouldn\u2019t.", "Yes there are definitely dads that after divorce are super involved and pay more than the minimum support regardless of the custody and support arrangements. \n\nIn my original comment here I even stated that it\u2019s not the moving abroad that makes him AH in my opinion but rather the way he frames everything. \n\nSome dads would absolutely make this move work for everyone, primarily the child. But there are many tells in his story about his character that make me doubt he is own of those dads.", "I meant take them away when he gets back. Obviously she needs to be fully autonomous parent when he\u2019s gone", ">he mom is shit for not allowing their child this amazing opportunity to experience life outside of whatever shithole US state they live in.\n\nNo thanks. Then if he refuses to send the kid back, it's an international case and she doesn't see her kid for years.\n\nOP seems to be OK with not seeing his child for months or years, but the mom clearly isn't (and all moms I know won't accept it).", "*Vsauce music starts*", "If he's not free over the whole summer, who is going to be looking after a 6-year old while he's at work for those months? \n\nHe's going to fly the child over to be in foreign day care from 9 to 5?  Who knows if the language is the same? \n\nHow does he square a weekend custody agreement into totally monopolising the kid during his vacation?\n\nIf he's got vacation days  he can fly home. If he hasn't, he has no business asking the kid to fly to a foreign country to sit and wait around for him all day. \n\nHe's not thinking this through.", "> isn't unheard of for international couples.\n\nThey are not a couple. She doesn't have to take 2 months out of her year's leave to enable his visitation. That is an unreasonable expectation.", "Quite clearly says I\u2019ll be back in the States in 3 years\u2026", "Op is from the US. I would rather struggle and be near my kid than take off and hardly see them for years.", "No thanks. And then, if he doesn't return the child, it's an international case and she won't get the child back for years. \n\nHe chose to move this far away. He didn't have to, he wanted to.", "He was ABLE to SEE his kid at the WEEKENDS before he moved ABROAD for money and career advancement.\n\nAll the kid knows is that he left.", "If he thought he would be universally told YTA, I\u2019m not sure why he posted, haha. I\u2019d think he would at least add it in the edit when he saw people were upset thinking that he did not HAVE to move countries, if he actually truly did have to move countries just to financially make it. Sure, his move may well be for the pay raise and not the travel, but even that would come nowhere close to being, \u201cI cannot survive on one income here,\u201d like you\u2019re suggesting.\n\n\nAnyway. Don\u2019t really have daddy issues to step out of just because my dad wasn\u2019t great, but thanks for the suggestion. I am an adult and do think like one, and if he literally couldn\u2019t afford to not move, I do understand the move would be practically inevitable. I just also happen to be an adult who doesn\u2019t see any indication in the post that he was forced to move and couldn\u2019t afford to live where he was. You know people can think your conclusion is unfounded without the disagreement being tied to them being childish morons that can\u2019t see past their trauma, right? You\u2019ve been insulting for no reason.", "Sure but even with a promotion and better pay, he is living in another country and will have all those usual expenses, plus the court ordered child support,  and  somehow thinks he could afford to pay for flights for ex and child and pay hotel accommodation costs for the ex for 2 months? \nAlso child support is to support your child and is not paying to see your child. Visitation is different to child support. People can pay zero  child support and still get to see their children", "So because she hasn't posted her side we shouldn't think outside the box? That's a very childish mindset.", "Who asked her to \"fly overseas for an extended period of time\".\n\nShe's also allowed to take the free flight over, then fly for free right back. How little effort IS this mom gonna put in for her kid?", "Sure, but I think \"I'm working overseas temporarily to provide a better life for my kid.\" is a pretty good excuse.", "Who's dragging who overseas? OP offered to pay for a ticket and hotel IF she wanted to go. She doesn't have to. She can also refuse to send the kid. The issue I'm having with the mom is that she seems to be shooting down all of OP's offers and not trying to find a solution that will work for the both of them. Looks like OP amended the post and is now saying that he's going to fly back himself so the point is moot.", "He could offer to do that but it makes a lot more sense for her to do that than for him to buy two round trip tickets. If she\u2019s capable I don\u2019t know why she wouldn\u2019t agree since he\u2019s paying for it. He should go back to court and fight for summer custody and implement travel rules.", "I do not think he is a very good parent at all but I think at this point providing more financially is really his only positive trait. He should take the opportunity to make more money to at least be doing something that makes his child\u2019s life better if he can\u2019t/won\u2019t be physically present.", "She didn't take it away when he gets back. He hasn't been back yet. When he comes back, he can petition the court to reinstate them.", "I would assume he would get childcare, which, I guess, the mother also avails of childcare so I don't see how that's different.   \nI assume that he would be able to get childcare in a language that the child is comfortable speaking in. You'd be surprised how easy it is to find resources like that abroad (Source: I live abroad and know many people who took their children abroad with them).   \nIt's completely possible that his company even provides childcare for its employees stationed abroad like OP.   \nI think it's pretty common for kids with international parents to spend whole summers with the parent who lives abroad. If the mom doesn't want to do the whole summer, that's totally fine, I'm not saying it's not. \n\nAll weekends in a year add up to 104 days. How many days are there during summer vacation (depends on the country). For the US and Canada it would be like 74 days? ish?  And he says he's going to visit too, besides. I think the amount of days total will be similar. \n\n  \nHe even says \"I plan to visit in January and will visit in the summer going forward into next year and the years after.\" So all this arguing about the kid going over there to visit is moot tbh.   \n\n\nSounds to me like he is thinking this through and trying to work something out with his schedule's and the mom's wants, but she's not willing to meet him halfway. Which is fine, I'm not saying that she has to cater to him, but he is showing a willingness to work something out to see his kid as much as possible. I disagree with everyone saying that he \"abandoned\" his kid.", "I agree, she doesn't. Never said she had to.", "Yes, sorry, missed that part. Even so, not all of the states is flush with cash. I'm from Canada and lots of people move to other parts of the country for better jobs.", "My mom turned down a good job opportunity when my sister and I were young and we're pretty salty about that, 25 years later. Even if it meant less time with our mom, our situations would have been infinitely better.   \n\n\nBetter healthcare (insurance), more money for Uni (and less student debt), we might not have had to enter the work force as early (we both started making our own money around 10 years old with paper routes and babysitting which turned into part time jobs when we were 14/15). Better food, better clothes (not name brands, but better quality/fits), better opportunities for stuff like clubs, excursions, sports, vacations etc.   \n\n\nI'm sure my mom was thinking the same thing, \"I'd rather struggle than...\" but a parent's struggle affects more than themself.", "That's a pretty extreme situation, but it does happen and that's a good point. I'm not saying that the mom has to let the child go abroad, and OP says that he's going to fly back to visit.

You probably shouldn\u2019t do that when you don\u2019t know all of the details.", "Why isn\u2019t he putting in the effort though? Sorry, but he\u2019s the one who chose to move overseas. He needs to be taking on the full effort of coming to get the kid and bringing him back.", "When a judge looks at how often he\u2019s coming back to see his kid, it\u2019s not going to look great. Especially considering it sounds like they got the custody ruling and he left to the new country fairly quickly. It makes him look like he\u2019s just running from responsibility there.", "He said the kid is too little to fly alone. He said she would need to fly him over and he would pay for a hotel. He has not added that he will fly back, he edited to add that he is in the new country since people weren\u2019t sure if he took the job yet. He has. And he expects his ex to uproot herself multiple times a year to accommodate his career choice.

I actually did consider the finances maybe being why he moved while I was reading the post. I considered it and then decided that probably wasn\u2019t the case since he gave no indication that he was forced to move because of finances. Clearly I\u2019m immature for considering it and not coming to the same conclusion as you, though.\n\n\nThe reason I mentioned my dad was, as I stated in my first comment, because you told someone to respond \u2018without making his story about you.\u2019 I am not a parent, so the closest thing I might be projecting with here would be stuff with my own dad. Hence why I added that part.
