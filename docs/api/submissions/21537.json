I don\u2019t really get her whole \u201cit isn\u2019t fair to her\u201d when you literally only have visitation so you moving literally does nothing to her. You\u2019re literally offering to fly her and your son over but she\u2019s being obstinate about it. I just don\u2019t understand parents like your ex who aren\u2019t trying to be accommodating to the needs of the child. You suck because you should have discussed how visitation would look before you took the job but honestly I guarantee that having more money in a college fund later will be more important than being physically present every weekend. Also with FaceTime and every video chat option it\u2019s not abandonment. You have plenty of ways to keep your connection as fulfilling as possible until you are able to see your son in person.", "YTA. I feel sorry for your child and your ex, who is probably heartbroken for your kid.", "YTA suggesting you\u2019ve done this to provide for your child is rubbish, how much do you, the absent father pay for your child?

This is very sad", "YTA my dad moved a few hours away a couple of years after my parents divorced (I wasn't young, we were 10, 14, 15). Saw him every now and then for a weekend. Then he moved interstate and we saw him for a week during the 4 school holidays. Moved even further away when we were 12, 16, 17 and we only visited once a year. Now, we hardly see him and he is basically a stranger. Not saying this has to happen, but 99% chance you will make your son a stranger.", "Yta and don\u2019t add salt to the wound by raising another kid instead of your own. Good luck with your future therapy bill and feeling guilty for missing milestone in her life.", "NTA. Just because dad moves abroad to help provide, doesn't have to mean abandonment. It does look like the wife is being vindictive here as well.\n\nHowever we have the internet today, daily videocalls can be helpful. Maybe daddy reads a story right before bed over the phone that way.... It's not forever, 3 years most likely. People are talking as if we live pre internet here.\n\nIt sounds like he'd make enough money to fly several times a year to visit his kid or have them visit him. Free holiday abroad for mom and kid.... Why complain?\n\nIt can work....", "YTA for abandoning your child.", "When my brother got divorced, he wanted primary physical custody. He had a truly crappy lawyer. They have joint but she has primary. She promptly moved the kids 150 miles away. He'd been planning to move out of state for a job opportunity. You know what he didn't do... move out of state. He drove that 150 miles to pick up or drop off his kids each weekend, alternating holidays, and for the 2 months he had them in the summer. He gave up dating opportunities, job opportunities, and a whole lot of free time so he could be at their football games, track meets, religious events. He loved his kids more than anything, and yeah, he and his ex chose divorce but he didn't choose abandonment. He chose to be as physically present as his life would allow. Fast forward 16 years. He and his boys have an amazing relationship. They understand and appreciate the sacrifices my brother made to stay involved in their lives. They return the favor by putting off some of their stuff to spend time with him. \n\nYTA. One day you'll be on this app whining about how your child has gone NC and wondering why.", "If your child still has a relationship with you when they grow up, they will ask you why you left them. Your answer best be good enough. This opportunity best be a life changing one, or at least an extremely noble one.\n\nYour post seems to convey that you are putting the onus on your 6 year old child to visit you? Make sure you're providing contact, you are ringing at a minimum once a week, and you are visiting your child at least every other month.

The people saying it\u2019s the exes fault like who cares about her, what about the child? Smh. Sorry you had to go through something like this too, first time I\u2019ve ever seen someone else go through the whole \u201cdad moving to another country\u201d thing\u2026 besides the kid in question here.", "After this he won\u2019t.", "The dude's TA because he up and left and assumed it would work out. Mom has NO obligation to let kid go abroad. And at this age? The kid's wishes aren't taken into account much. Effectively, OP has forfeited his custody.", "You have a valid point in the need to explore other ways for OP to stay connected with his kid. He's already left the country (how that didn't violate the custody agreement, I don't know, but that's another issue). If he genuinely wants to stay in contact, he needs to work very hard to arrange regular video calls and video recordings that can be shared, etc. At 6, the child needs frequent contact, both scheduled and ad hoc - not a few weeks once or twice a year, even if the total connection time is the same. How he sets up and delivers on that contact, and how he manages the necessary formal changes to the legal custody agreement, will be very telling and will be used in any future custody determinations.", "And what of her commitments, such as a job? She may not want to commit every vacation she gets to escorting the child to the father in the country he chose to live in. She may not even get enough vacation days to make that possible, especially if OP's location isn't a single direct flight. The USA is very stingy with annual leave, and in case you don't know, having a kid almost guarantees you have to use several days of it each year to meet their needs. \n\nWhat you suggest is only thinkable if she is not employed and only for a period of time until she needs to get a job or get more training/qualifications to get a job.", "Finally someone with some fucking sense!", "This is terrible advice, she would have a very good chance of removing all custody in this situation (from my experience as a family lawyer) and he should be absolutely worried about that, if he gave a shit about his kid, which he doesn\u2019t. And there\u2019s a good chance the kid won\u2019t get over it, especially when the \u201cprobably back in three years\u201d turns out to be longer.", "The wife didn\u2019t say it\u2019s unfair to herself she said it\u2019s unfair to the child.", "Mom\u2019s the one not being accommodating to the needs of the child by refusing to uproot her life every summer and live in a hotel room in her ex\u2019s country and presumably provide free childcare during \u201cdad\u2019s summers\u201d? What in the patriarchy is this bullshit? \n\nHe \u201conly has visitation\u201d every second weekend, so he wouldn\u2019t go more than 12 days without seeing his kid (and probably has shared holidays and the right to attend sports games, PTAs, class plays, etc), and he chose to move across the world and abandon his kid for 10+ months a year. \n\nI\u2019d also challenge your guarantee and say that almost any kid would rather have a present and loving parent than a fat college fund. This whole take is bonkers.", "If he has to pay a massive amount of child support, getting the promotion doesn\u2019t help him provide more for himself and his child, it just helps him provide more for himself.  The child support is already going to provide the basic necessities for the child, and he probably feels that it makes a big dent in his personal finances now for his wants, hence taking the promotion even though it takes him far away from his child. \n\nAll of this talk as those child support goes to mom\u2019s spa days or whatever is so f*cking ridiculous. For every one case where that\u2019s actually true, there are hundreds of moms who still have to work minimum 1-2 full time jobs just to keep the family taken care of even with the child support payment, if they even get any. Tons of dads in arrears. \n\nThey base the support payment on income. So even though it might make a dent in your lifestyle, they will only take so much out of your total income. \n\nMeanwhile, mom doesn\u2019t get to pay rent or food bills etc based on income. She can\u2019t say \u201cwell I only make x so I can only pay you x\u201d to the landlords, utility companies, etc, so if it isn\u2019t enough to take care of the kids she has to work more hours or get a second job. \n\nWhen you have kids is your responsibility to care for them even if it makes your life significantly inconvenient, so the dads paying child support should feel grateful that they get charged a fixed amount, since the primary parent is stuck covering the blank check of parenting.", "I thought he meant his wife had a bad lawyer so he still got every weekend", "None of the good lawyers were interested in trying to get primary custody for a man who was ready to leave the country.", "Nope, if he wanted to see his kid he wouldn't have moved to an entirely different country.

He could see him every weekend, And work on getting more custody. He couldve used this assigment as a wakeup call to mom and say ill stay if we can have a more fair custody arrangement. Dirty but at least fighting for his kid", "Even more, he\u2019s the kind that can\u2019t name the pediatrician or teacher and doesn\u2019t do the driving to school or appointments, but will still demand on having a say in everything that his wife does related to these activities. \n\nMy ex didn\u2019t go to a single pre-school with me and my kid to meet the teachers and see the facilities (not because he was at work, he just wanted to stay home on the couch) but then when I chose one after 5 appointments that week he was fuming. Apparently I was supposed to give him the final word. It\u2019s a type.", "It\u2019s likely he would owe full child support with anything less than shared custody. In my experience in this field, dude lost his bid for custody (to get child support from the mom, or at least have it be somewhat even) so he figured why bother sticking around if it\u2019s going to cost him the same for every second weekend or once a year. Zero consideration for the child or their needs. Major YTA.", "He didn\u2019t mention anything like that, though. Pretty sure he would have noted that in his own defense if it were the case.\n\n\nBecause of what you said at the end, adding this on. This is not me making the story about myself in any way, FYI - my dad sucked in his own ways, but no abandonment issues from him here.

Just because he's going to be out of the country for a few years, doesn't mean that he's abandoning his kid. He wants to make more money to support his child. Doesn't sound deadbeat to me at all. Plus he seems to be trying to make arrangements to see his child. Not his fault that the mom isn't cooperating.", "Completely true.", "I\u2019m not saying she has to stay there at the hotel, he could literally fly her out with the son and fly her back, if he has that kind of money he definitely has the kind of money to afford a babysitter to watch his son during the summer while he works. It\u2019s also only 3 years, and depending on the opportunities for promotion could be one of the few options he has to grow his career. I also want to know if she works and why it would be such an inconvenience for her to fly to him. I know everyone will disagree with the money aspect but it could literally be the thing that sets the child up for a better life.", "It also could mean that he could also start paying more in child support to give his kid more clothes and things. There are also lots of posts of people paying more than the minimum so they could provide better when their finances are more secure. And I don\u2019t blame someone for taking a higher paying job to increase their quality of life.

Yall are acting like paying child support on top of how expensive it is to live on one income is the easiest thing in the world to pull off.\n\nThey got divorced so we lost half the income he was used to and NOW he has to pay to be unable to see his kid.
