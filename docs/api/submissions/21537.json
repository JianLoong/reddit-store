You wanted custody but you've made the choice to never see your child? You wanted custody to spite your ex. You didn't get it so you're bailing.", "YTA \n\nIf I\u2019m being suspicious, it would seem like you\u2019re making up excuses to not see your kid at all but in a way that saves face so you\u2019re not viewed as a deadbeat. \u201cOh I only got weekends but I\u2019m totally gonna get my kid back by\u2026 moving countries? Making crazy demands of my ex? Blaming the lawyer and getting another?\u201d\n\nYou wanna see your kid?  You could have seen them every weekend.  Guess it wasn\u2019t that important to you compared to a career choice \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f no wonder the wife got more custody.", "YTA \nMy ex moved across the country to be with his affair partner when we got divorced. Kids were 8 and 5. The oldest is now 17 and has major abandonment issues, anxiety, depression, etc. Note - that relationship didn\u2019t work out for him (shocking) and he came back about 4 years later but the damage was done.", "YTA. You made the decision, now you have to deal with the consequences.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t get what you wanted, so now you\u2019re leaving your kid behind to move to another country. Your ex-wife didn\u2019t do that. You did. Now your kid isn\u2019t going to see you for months when he should be getting *weekly* time with his other parent.", "YTA. Some father.", "Wow dude, how do you type out \"I'm abandoning my kid for a job abroad\" and not realize you're a giant a-hole? \"Oh I wanted custody... blah blah blah\" keep telling yourself that \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your child didn't have a choice. You guys did. She's here now. Heaven forbid something happens to you or her in that span of time. You will never forgive yourself.", "YTA. You basically abandoned your child.", "I'm confused. Is this a done deal? The title makes it sound like you've already moved abroad, but the text isn't as clear.", "YTA, if you don't take your child during your custody time, you should absolutely not have that designated as your custody time. If  she has the child full time during the school year and you during the summer, then the custody agreement should be changed to reflect what is actually happening.", "YTA. Your child NEEDS you. You WANT the over seas location to help you out. But right now your child needs you. They need as much normalcy as possible. can you imagine what the child is thinking?!?! My mom and dad got divorced. I only get to see dad twice a month. Oh wait. I get to see him once a year. He abandoned me.", "YTA for blaming your lawyer.  There are more bad clients than there are bad attorneys.", "hmmm it is your decision, you are fully responsible for the consequences, that is all I would say. Meybe except your ex is not an AH for not agreeing to fly out somewhere to accomodate your new job. You need to fly back to your kid man.", "Talk to your lawyer...", "NTA\nThe YTA comments are absurd to me - \n\nDad isn\u2019t going away forever. Hes going abroad for only 3 years in order to be able to give more to his child. I don\u2019t think you are right to want primary custody right now but thats not the ask here. \n\nAnyways, dad is willing to pay for visits of both exwife and kid. They dont need to accept that though. However have other options been explored - video calls, phone calls, or even emails are all viable options to stay in contact for the time being. Exwife will absolutely use this as a way to remove you from the childs life, but if that isnt what or the child want then take the steps now to make sure she fails", "NTA. You took a temporary position that would further your career.  Your ex- wife's inability to be flexible is not your problem. If you are looking at Christmas break and summers you could always fly them in with family or a friend.  The main point is that your child has access to you and knows you love them! For all those saying otherwise, please note their are plenty of divorced/ absent parents in close proximity to their child that make no effort at all. Do what is best for you and your child in the long run. Love covers miles!", "NAH:  I can't call you an asshole because if I  believed you were an asshole for working abroad, every parent in the military would be considered an AH.", "NTA, provided that you don't turn into a two-weeks-during-summer type of dad.\n\nFrequent video calls, attending events remotely, etc.\nYour ex doesn't get a say in whether you have visitation or not, but you'll likely have to go to court to take your child out of the country if the other parent doesn't want to go.\n\nGet a better lawyer.", "NTA - Your wife wanted custody, now she\u2019s got custody. Whatever you do she\u2019s never gonna be happy. You gotta live your life", "NTA", "Not the asshole. She reminds me of my ex wife, truly vile! It would be hard to fight for custody from overseas and I don't think that the judge would allow it to be go through without you being there. She will probably want to hit you up for more child support once you get back. But not the asshole!! I know my ex wanted to raise child support but they would not let it happen. So you have some relief there. Save your money as much as you can so you can fight for your kid. \n\nShe can't have it her way. You have to live and you have to support your kid.

You're either a fool or an arrogant narcissist. Or both. You think you can just waltz back into your daughter's life after three years and pick up where you left off?

You're whining about custody but if you really cared about spending time with your daughter you wouldn't choose to give up even more time with her.

It is more that he did not make any attempt to get one put in place before moving. The current plan does not allow for international travel during the summers or breaks. He is also attempting to fly his ex out to him against her will in order to be with the child (assuming while he is working) and for her to do the back and forth travel with said child. If he wants that as the plan then he needs to one, attempt to get a court order for it and two, take responsibility for flying to the child and then flying the child back to mom at the end of that visitation. \n\nRight now he has every weekend visitation.

She may not be able to get that time off work, for a start, or she may actually have things *she* wants to do with her available vacation time.

OP says he\u2019s going to visit instead, with the first visit being next January.
