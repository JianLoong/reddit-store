We\u2019ve been together since we were teens. I\u2019ll preface it by saying that we\u2019ve been struggling for a while, and have been in marriage counseling since May. We\u2019ve had ups and downs since then, and right now we\u2019re definitely in a down period. We have four kids together. \n\nOur washing machine broke yesterday, and DH is very handy, but wasn\u2019t going to be able to fix it in time for us to wash clothes for church this morning. So I told the kids if they absolutely needed something cleaned to wear to church, to go get it and I\u2019ll wash it by hand. (I think I said \u2018I,\u2019 but I may have said \u2018we.\u2019 Not sure if it matters.) \n\nThe only kid who needed something washed was our 12 yr old son. DH asked me \u201cdo you want me to wash them?\u201d and I said \u201cyes,\u201d or \u201csure.\u201d Frankly, I was surprised he offered and expected that I would have been the one washing them, because DH had been working most of the day - not typical for him on a Saturday - but I didn\u2019t push back. In the past, he has expressed frustration when I question his offers to help. \n\nSo he hand-washed and machine dried a polo and a pair of khakis for our son. \n\nFast-forward to today. DH went to church early. I got the kids ready and brought them later. We were rushing, which we always are, and I overheard my 12yo complaining about something about his clothes across the house, but I didn\u2019t investigate what was wrong and he didn\u2019t come and ask for help. He went to the car without me seeing him, and when we got to church, we all went separate ways for various things. Honestly, I saw my son several times throughout the morning, but I never noticed what he was wearing. I can\u2019t tell you why, but I just didn\u2019t. \n\nWhen I got home later after dropping our daughter off somewhere, DH asked why our son wasn\u2019t wearing the clothes he washed for him. I realized I had no idea. Son came out and explained that the pants were too small so he fished some other stuff out of the laundry to wear - a sports jersey, gym shorts, under armor tights and shirt\u2026 I was appalled. \n\nHusband is furious at me for not checking him before he left the house. He says he wasted his time washing the clothes and I wasted his time by not checking to make sure the kid was dressed appropriately before we left. \n\nI\u2019m furious that DH is furious and don\u2019t see why I owe him an apology! I think if I\u2019m an asshole, it\u2019s for not making sure our son has clothes that fit and are clean, not because I didn\u2019t inspect him before we left the house. \n\nContext: DH is typically responsible for laundry - washing, drying and folding. The kids make sure it gets right side out and to the laundry room and put away. I help the youngest who\u2019s just turned 5. I\u2019m responsible for shopping and all cooking except on Monday night, which is my husband\u2019s day off.

Husband took the initiative to handwash clothes. Twelve is old enough to know a pair a pants you wore recently didn't fit then and won't magically fit now.

My dad was the snooty type who would bash people for \"looking like they're going to a cookout instead of church.\" But it was the expectation and if I tried to get away with wearing what your son did I would have been in BIIIIIIIIG trouble.\n\nOverall I don't think anyone's an asshole, but if the norm is a polo and no jeans and your son took advantage of you being distracted to dress casually there's a bit more leeway for your husband's reaction.", "NTA, why is clothing patrol your job", "When I was a kid, two separate families came home from church and didn't notice until they were home that they had forgotten one of their kids at church. (They were both families with four kids in case you are wondering.). Oversights happen. Mornings are busy.  This didn't hurt anybody. Please forgive each other.  It could just be a funny story  but it sounds like your relationship is not in a place where there is room for a sense of humor. NAH I hope you work things out.", "Your DH was made at you because you didn't make sure your son wore clothes that didn't fit? NTA and good luck with that one.", "Furious seems an over reaction to me.  \n\nNTA your husband sounds exhausting.", "NTA. 12 is old enough that you shouldn\u2019t have to \u201ccheck\u201d him.", "Actually if you wear glasses you're not allowed to look at or go up to alters...", "None of this is the kid's fault, what is wrong with you??", ">I got the kids ready \n\nHow did you do this without registering what he was wearing?", "Washing machine is temporarily broken.", "with most 12yos, \"getting them ready\" just means telling them to get ready. OP obviously has a lot of stress going on and it's completely understandable that someone with multiple kids would not register what an older kid was wearing.", "My parents forced us because that's what your supposed to do & they wouldn't be buried by the church if they didn't drop their envelope with money in the basket every week.", "NTA. Funny story: As a kid, I sang in a church children\u2019s choir. One day, we sang during the service. Afterwards, my mum talked to two of the boys in the church children\u2019s choir because they happened to wear the same shirt (a fact they found hilarious when they noticed) which had a huge skull on it. Turns out that one of them had had his clothes picked out by his grandma.", "Your son put was wearing clean, well-fittimg clothes.  What's the problem? You're not missing anything.\n\nAnd God is not concerned with what anyone is wearing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. There wouldn't even be an AH here if your husband hadn't decided to be one. It *should* be a funny family story. Dude needs to chill.\n\nYour husband should be at parties making you blush by saying, \"So our son wore a sports jersey, gym shorts, and long-johns to church and Marie was so busy she didn't even catch him!\"\n\nWhat's his *actual* problem? Does he get weird about how the family is perceived? Does he have control issues? Temper issues? His reaction is weirding me out.", "Could have skipped church in favor of fixing the machine.  ESH.", "Stupid fight. You\u2019re both fighting a battle that doesn\u2019t need to be fought. It\u2019s not always about being right.
