{"id": 21930, "submission_id": "14wkzlj", "title": "AITA for putting my roommate's figurines in a box, causing damage and refusing to pay for it?", "selftext": "I (21F) own a two-bedroom apartment, where every bedroom has its own bathroom. Because I don't have much use for the second bedroom, I've been renting it out to 'Joe' (30M) for the past 1,5 years. It worked out pretty well since we only had to share the entrance, kitchen and living room, so plenty of privacy.\n\nThree months ago, Joe and his girlfriend got a house together, so Joe moved out of my apartment. He left some stuff behind (pretty much just a bookcase full of movie and game figurines) asking if he could pick them up in one or two weeks after the renovations to his apartment are done, so he could store them properly then. I agreed since I know stuff can easily get damaged or go missing during renovations.\n\nHowever, after two weeks, he still hadn't picked them up. I asked him when he was going to pick them up, and he apologised and said he'll be there next week to get them. Another two weeks went by and he still hadn't picked them up. Meanwhile, I can't rent out the room to someone else because his stuff is still there. It's now been two months since Joe moved out, and despite me asking him several times he still hasn't picked up the figurines. So I put them all in a giant box (gently, though also not using any wrapping material), loaded it into my car and just brought them over myself. Since noone answered the door, I just left the box at the door to his new house.\n\nTwo days later I'm getting a lot of angry messages from him how I've ruined his collection, how a lot of them are broken, and demanding I reimburse him for all the ones that I damaged (according to him it's several thousand dollars).  \n\nI refuse to pay for it because I don't think I did anything wrong. I think I've been really patient with him for storing his figurines for so long, and think that it's his own fault that his figurines are broken now, because I gave him plenty of chances to pick them up himself.\n\nAITA for packing up my roommates figurines and leaving them at the door of his new home, causing them to be damaged, and then not wanting to reimburse him?", "created_utc": 1689063252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wkzlj/aita_for_putting_my_roommates_figurines_in_a_box/", "score": 313, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they were so valuable to him, he would have picked them up instead of forgetting about them for two months and blowing off your requests that he pick up his stuff. \n\nI mean, yeah, that's not how you pack figurines to move, but they also weren't your responsibility to care for and he pretty much abandoned them.", "LMAO, NTA! He refused to pick them up and was using you for storage and wasting your time. He probably wasn't going to pick it up anyway.", "NTA.\n\nYou reached out to him repeatedly after the agreed upon time and he failed to pick up his possessions. I think you\u2019ll find that this would be considered abandonment and you could have legally trashed them. It\u2019s also possible you could charge him rent for the room for the period his possessions remained there. But do your due diligence on local laws.", "NTA.\n\nYour home is not a storage facility.  (Although I would have begun charging him storage fees, after the initial two weeks was up. It may not have made up for the rent you otherwise could have got for the room, but it would have been better than nothing.)\n\nYou didn't break the figurines on purpose. All care, no responsibility. The actions you took were reasonable.\n\nI'd venture to say you have no legal obligation to reimburse him, although that depends on where you live, and AITA is not a legal advice sub anyway.\n\nYou certainly have no moral obligation to reimburse him.", "There's likely caselaw you could look up around 'abandoned property', and what your actual legal obligations might have been, but IMO you went above and beyond. You likely could have left them on the sidewalk in front of your house. NTA", "NTA you could of course have been more careful and wrapped them up, but also he waited way too long and caused issues for you as well.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s just trying to get money. You did more than you needed to. After the first month most landlords would have sent a message saying if the person didn\u2019t come get it, the garbage truck would. You should send him an invoice for the box and the gas and for the months you couldn\u2019t rent it out because of his abandoned items.", "ETA - if Joe is still keeping his belongings there then he hasn't actually moved out and he would owe you rent until his things are removed. You can't rent it because his things are there then he is still there and still owes money for rent. To remove his things you could have wrapped them individually so that they wouldn't have broken which is how anybody would move things like that but you didn't do it. You could tell him that you're sorry and that you will pay him back but he would also need to pay you rent for the time that his things were there and whatever the difference is should get paid out. (My guess is that he would owe more)\n\nEdit: you also should have told him up front that in order to store his things you will have to charge him rent because you won't be able to rent out the room. If you hadn't thought of it as soon as you realized it, you should have told him and maybe he would have gotten his thing sooner or it could have resulted in a better arrangement for both of you.", "NTA, you put up with him enough, he should have come himself if he cared for them.", "NTA. If they were so valuable and precious, he\u2019d have come to collect them himself. Depending on your jurisdiction, him abandoning them for so long may actually give you the legal right to sell or throw them out, so your decision to drop them off with their lazy rightful owner is actually pretty generous.", "NTA although to be totally in the clear you should have warned him what you were planning to do the last time you spoke to him , i.e. \"I need them out of the house this Saturday, if not I'll pack them up and put them on your doorstep/throw them out/donate them to charity\" etc. If you give him a final warning like that and he still doesn't pick them up then they become abandoned property and you can do what you want with them.", "How does he know they were damaged by you?

I\u2019d say he owes you $$$", "YTA Just pay him back for them.", "please explain more about what happened here.. If the figurines were some kind of stone, then not using wraping material is pretty stupid and it is not strange they got damaged in transport and he is mad.\n\nIf they where pastic, how the hell did they get broken?", "Out of curiosity what kind of figurines were they?", "No, if his stuff was there preventing you from renting the room, he should have been paying rent. \n\nHe abandoned the property and didn\u2019t come when you asked him. Tell him you will sue him for rent for not clearing out the room. NTA.", "NTA\n\nTell him he's lucky you're not charging him rent for all the time his stuff was in your apartment.

Block him.", "INFO: Why didn't you use packing paper?", "YTA. I get being annoyed that he didn\u2019t get them when promised but it is one box of stuff. How much effort is it to wrap them in newspaper?", "I doubt they were broken tbh. I think Joe was trying to get some money out of op. If the figurines were broken op would have heard when moving the box . \n\nNTA anyway", "Absolutely the right answer. \n\nAlso\u2026 asking people to pay for things and claiming a certain resale value is 90% of the time ridiculous. People will go to eBay and find something listed at a certain price and claim that means that\u2019s the resale value. No, that\u2019s what some idiot is trying (and failing) to sell it for.\n\nIf they were worth anything to him, he\u2019d have picked them up. He just saw an opportunity to try and get some money out of you and is hoping you feel bad enough to not question it", "He also cost her potentially two months of rent because she couldn't have a new tenant move into his old room. She should send him a bill.", "Nope", "Why? Those are the natural consequences of his actions. He was asked for over a month to get his stuff from the apartment and he never bothered. He likely knew OP needed the space cleared for a new renter but instead decided to use him as free storage which is just selfish. If he cared so much about his precious figurines then he should have come and got them himself and not waited for OP to get sick of being messed around and dealing with it themselves", "If they are that valuable then he should have taken better care of them", "Why does OP owe him for something he should have taken care of himself?", "I honestly have no idea what kind of material they really are. Some were really solid plastic, some were heavy as stone but didn't feel like stone. Kind of felt like synthetic plastic-like stone if that's a thing? \n\nI did put them in the box carefully, but I admit I was also pretty much over it after having asked him to pick them up so often, that I didn't really go through any additional effort of buying plastic wrap to properly package them.\n\nHonestly didn't think they'd be so fragile since they felt pretty solid, but also didn't really feel like it was my responsibility to act as a moving service.", "Pretty much a big mix of all kinds of different figurines. Some were from games (I assume from collector editions), others were from movies and series. There was a lightsaber replica in there too.", "Exactly. OP didn\u2019t sign up for being someone\u2019s free storage unit, and was actually *losing* money from the lost potential to rent the room out.", "> Those are the natural consequences of his action\n\nPaying for things you damage is also a natural consequence of actions of being careless with others their property.", "Once he refused to pick it up for weeks, keeping OP \nfrom using her own space, I'd say it was abandoned property. You snooze, you lose.", "Not in the wrong. \nScrew him for not being considerate of your kindness as long as you allowed. \nIt\u2019s most likely his new wife doesn\u2019t want that crap in the house and he\u2019s taking longer to get a \u201cman cave\u201d ready. \nYou did nothing wrong. \u270c\ud83c\udffd", "ESH. Him for not taking care of it himself, and you for choosing such a passive-aggressive (emphasis on the aggressive) way to \u201cresolve\u201d it.", "ESH\nI get that he should have got the figures earlier and him just promising to get them is an asshole move from his part, but you put his collector edition figurines in a box without any wrapping paper whatsoever and thought they would be fine? You have your apartment which means you moved your stuff around at least once, you know that you have to put wrapping paper in the boxes so stuff don\u2019t break. You should indeed pay for them, because you damaged them and he has to replace them. You should hope that you didn\u2019t break anything that was limited edition.\n(Verdict from a figure collector)", "You just left the box outside his door....   Hard YTA", "Tell Joe to go fudge himself tbh.", "NTA after 30 days most places would consider it abandoned property anyway. You don't owe him anything. If he cares that much he would have never left them", "NTA.  You gave him plenty opportunities to pick them up.  They were in the way of you renting the space.  What else were you supposed to do?  If these figurines were so valuable & so important to him, why didn't he come & get them himself?  It's his own fault for not picking them up when he said he would.", "NTA. I bet the figurines are perfectly fine. Joe is lucky you didn\u2019t charge him rent for storing his crap.", "Till him he owes you two months rent", "NTA - He should be glad you didn't sell them to someone else.  At some point, they are legally abandoned and become your property.", "would be interesting to see what a small claims court judge would think of this. Kind of feel like they'd tell him to pound sand, especially when you consider the rent she lost out on.", "NTA, and I wonder if OP could demand Joe reimburse him for storage costs and for preventing OP re-renting the space for more than a month?", "This exactly. If he really wants to go down this road, he should be reimbursing you for the income you lost in the months that he expected you to store his stuff in your spare bedroom", "The entitlement. He\u2019s leaving his toys behind and preventing OP from renting the room out, but she should have to pay for the damage done to his abandoned toys? Hahahaha, no. That\u2019s not how life works. I\u2019ve told every roomie I\u2019ve ever had that they have two weeks after move out to get anything they want to keep. After that, it\u2019s on the curb and they can race the garbage men and trash pickers for their treasures. If it matters to them, they\u2019ll find a way. OP delivering the stuff was above and beyond generous.", "Actually just send Joe a note that technically since his stuff prevented you from renting out the room, he still owes you the rent for that period, as well as costs for storing his stuff and transportation. Let him know he'll be hearing from your lawyers soon regarding the rent arrears. Somehow his figurines will magically be repaired.", "NTA\nHow much Money did you lose, because you didn't could rent out his old room?\nI bet more than $2000?\nIf yes send Him a bill for your lose of Money and a bill for having his crap in your apartment as storage bill\n\nAnd I doubt they are broken and if then either he or his girlfriend broke them ton get Cash out of you", "NTA - You know the phrase, \"possession is 9/10ths of the law?\" Joe abandoned his things in your possession. He's lucky you didn't just throw it all away.", "NTA, he abandoned that stuff for 3 months, he should be thankful that you didn't throw it away", "Info: did he pay rent while storing them there? I\u2019m assuming not, but if he was then that does change things.", "NTA, both morally and legally, where I live after a month of trying to get him to pick it up, it becomes abandoned property.", "Info: what kind of figurines are these that they can so easily damage?\n\nIf he really cared, he would have gotten them. That's 2 months of rent you've lost out on because he's been using you as a free storage unit. If his figurines couldn't survive a, I'm guessing 20 minutes at most car ride, then he realllllly should have made sure to come get them and carefully wrap and transport them.", "NTA I would\u2019ve given him a hard date and then said they would be put up for sale as he clearly abandoned his property.", "NTA.  I admit - I am a middle aged man with action figures (or adult collectibles as the companies like to claim).  If I pulled this and a couple were accidentally broken, yes, I'd be annoyed, but at myself not at you.  Now if you smashed them all on purpose, that would be a different story.  Definitely not an AH here.", "Ask him what he thinks you owe him.\nSend him an invoice for storage, packing, and transportation for the exact same amount.\nVoila! A clean transaction where no money must change hands.", "NTA", "NTA. If he cared about them he should have come and gotten them. IMO, he's lucky you returned them and didn't just box them up and toss them.

OP should have just tossed them a month sooner than they did.\n\nI also expect this is more a case of new GF didn't want the nerdy toys in the house and so he left them there and is now trying to get money for them than anything else.  People don't 'leave' things they value when moving.  They're more likely to move it themselves early on in the process than leave it somewhere for months.

I am impressed you took them to him. That was above and beyond behavior. I would have thrown them away!", "NTA but could have been handled better. Should have just given him a date and told him if he didn't pick them up you would pack them up and put them in storage or something.", "YTA - You didn't pack them properly, they got damaged.  That's on you, not him even if he left for two months.  You said you would keep them and that responsibility is on you.  Apologize and pay for the damage.", "NTA but potentially be ready for a civil suit if they were damaged and they are worth that much", "Noone leaves a collection worth several thousands of dollars behind for two months and complains days later without proof that they are damaged. Its definitely a scam. If anyone owes anyone compensation then its him for hogging a room hes not paying rent for causing you to miss rent from a possible new renter. NTA", "NTA.  You should tell him he owes you 2 months rent since you haven't been able to use the space, especially after he kept saying he was coming to get everything.", "NTA \n\nwhat's your state's law on abandoned property? his collection (that he never picked up for 2 months!!!) could be yours to do with as you see fit.\n\nwoulda thrown them in the trash or tried to sell them tbh", "NTA, but if the situation arises again, don't bother bringing them back. Just throw them away or sell them.", "I\u2019d send him an invoice for storing his \u201cexpensive figurines\u201d and since they were sooo expensive, I\u2019d charge each figurine separately by how much they\u2019re worth and by how much you safely kept them. I\u2019d prob label it as that you had to store high value objects so each object was priced different. 2 months? 60 days? Yea, he wants to be a cheapskate, then you can be one too.", "NTA but I\u2019m smelling BS!\n\nIf the figures were that valuable and important he would have come to pack them at the first opportunity even if it was to just keep them stored. After op dropped them off it took 2 days to message they were damaged\u2026 Come on, this looks like a cash grab", "NTA- if those figurines were as valuable as he\u2019s claiming they were then he would\u2019ve picked them up much earlier.

I was looking up an old 90's board game on ebay and people were listing them for huge chunks of money, and other listings had them for $30 in the same condition.

Experts said it may be the biggest, but it's a muddy undesirable color so the market value is maybe a few grand at best).", "Hey, that kind of crap can sometimes work in your favor. Last time I moved, the moving company damaged an old CRT monitor used with a C64. I probably got the thing for $10 at a thrift shop \u2014 nothing special.\n\nWell, when I filed the damage claim, the person on their end probably had no idea how to value a 40-year-old piece of electronics, so just went on eBay \u2014 and found a Buy-it-Now listing at an insane price of like $150 or something.\n\nA few days later, I had a check for $150 in the mail.", "OP should call it quits for the month of rental income they lost out on.", "NTA\n\nYou have documentation that you tried numerous times to have him come get them.

June (random date), I will put them in a box and put them on the street for you to pickup anytime. Alternatively, you can pay the rent for the time i need to store them. Let me know until 24. June what option you want. Cheers.", "NTA\n\nAsk him to reimburse the rent loss.", "Did he pay rent while you stored them.?  If his little toys are so pweshuss , he wouldn't leave them for so long.", "You couldn't rent out the room for 2mths because he was using your place as free storage so tell him he owes you x amount for storage", "NTA. He has plenty of nerve complaining. He abandoned them legally, morally and otherwise.", "As soon as he pays her for two months of lost rent revenue, fees for safekeeping his figurines and delivery fee of those.", "Exactly they probably need money for reno's and this was just an all too convenient way to get it out of someone by claiming they damaged your stuff", "\"sure. I'll pay you back but I'll deduct two months' rent and storage from that cost\"", "I just looked this up the other day for another post here where a guy sold a fridge that his friend had left at his house for four years. In the UK, the rules are set out by the The Torts (Interference with Goods) Act of 1977. \n\nThat law states that when items are left behind, the landlord has to notify the previous tenant about the leftover items by either registered mail or recorded delivery. The landlord also has to specify a reasonable time frame in which the items need to be collected, and the law considers 14 to 28 days to be a reasonable amount of time to collect the items or they automatically become the property of the landlord to do with them as they wish (sell or discard). \n\nSo you only have two to four weeks in most cases, not eight. The only exception is if the lease has a specific provision as to when left items need to be collected before they are considered abandoned. \n\nSource: https://www.kdllaw.com/legal-updates/what-do-you-do-with-abandoned-belongings", "He is the one who was careless with his property."]}
