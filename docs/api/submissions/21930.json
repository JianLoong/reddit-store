{"id": 21930, "submission_id": "14wkzlj", "title": "AITA for putting my roommate's figurines in a box, causing damage and refusing to pay for it?", "selftext": "I (21F) own a two-bedroom apartment, where every bedroom has its own bathroom. Because I don't have much use for the second bedroom, I've been renting it out to 'Joe' (30M) for the past 1,5 years. It worked out pretty well since we only had to share the entrance, kitchen and living room, so plenty of privacy.\n\nThree months ago, Joe and his girlfriend got a house together, so Joe moved out of my apartment. He left some stuff behind (pretty much just a bookcase full of movie and game figurines) asking if he could pick them up in one or two weeks after the renovations to his apartment are done, so he could store them properly then. I agreed since I know stuff can easily get damaged or go missing during renovations.\n\nHowever, after two weeks, he still hadn't picked them up. I asked him when he was going to pick them up, and he apologised and said he'll be there next week to get them. Another two weeks went by and he still hadn't picked them up. Meanwhile, I can't rent out the room to someone else because his stuff is still there. It's now been two months since Joe moved out, and despite me asking him several times he still hasn't picked up the figurines. So I put them all in a giant box (gently, though also not using any wrapping material), loaded it into my car and just brought them over myself. Since noone answered the door, I just left the box at the door to his new house.\n\nTwo days later I'm getting a lot of angry messages from him how I've ruined his collection, how a lot of them are broken, and demanding I reimburse him for all the ones that I damaged (according to him it's several thousand dollars).  \n\nI refuse to pay for it because I don't think I did anything wrong. I think I've been really patient with him for storing his figurines for so long, and think that it's his own fault that his figurines are broken now, because I gave him plenty of chances to pick them up himself.\n\nAITA for packing up my roommates figurines and leaving them at the door of his new home, causing them to be damaged, and then not wanting to reimburse him?", "created_utc": 1689063252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wkzlj/aita_for_putting_my_roommates_figurines_in_a_box/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they were so valuable to him, he would have picked them up instead of forgetting about them for two months and blowing off your requests that he pick up his stuff. \n\nI mean, yeah, that's not how you pack figurines to move, but they also weren't your responsibility to care for and he pretty much abandoned them.", "LMAO, NTA! He refused to pick them up and was using you for storage and wasting your time. He probably wasn't going to pick it up anyway.", "NTA.\n\nYou reached out to him repeatedly after the agreed upon time and he failed to pick up his possessions. I think you\u2019ll find that this would be considered abandonment and you could have legally trashed them. It\u2019s also possible you could charge him rent for the room for the period his possessions remained there. But do your due diligence on local laws.", "NTA.\n\nYour home is not a storage facility.  (Although I would have begun charging him storage fees, after the initial two weeks was up. It may not have made up for the rent you otherwise could have got for the room, but it would have been better than nothing.)\n\nYou didn't break the figurines on purpose. All care, no responsibility. The actions you took were reasonable.\n\nI'd venture to say you have no legal obligation to reimburse him, although that depends on where you live, and AITA is not a legal advice sub anyway.\n\nYou certainly have no moral obligation to reimburse him.", "There's likely caselaw you could look up around 'abandoned property', and what your actual legal obligations might have been, but IMO you went above and beyond. You likely could have left them on the sidewalk in front of your house. NTA", "NTA you could of course have been more careful and wrapped them up, but also he waited way too long and caused issues for you as well.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s just trying to get money. You did more than you needed to. After the first month most landlords would have sent a message saying if the person didn\u2019t come get it, the garbage truck would. You should send him an invoice for the box and the gas and for the months you couldn\u2019t rent it out because of his abandoned items.", "ETA - if Joe is still keeping his belongings there then he hasn't actually moved out and he would owe you rent until his things are removed. You can't rent it because his things are there then he is still there and still owes money for rent. To remove his things you could have wrapped them individually so that they wouldn't have broken which is how anybody would move things like that but you didn't do it. You could tell him that you're sorry and that you will pay him back but he would also need to pay you rent for the time that his things were there and whatever the difference is should get paid out. (My guess is that he would owe more)\n\nEdit: you also should have told him up front that in order to store his things you will have to charge him rent because you won't be able to rent out the room. If you hadn't thought of it as soon as you realized it, you should have told him and maybe he would have gotten his thing sooner or it could have resulted in a better arrangement for both of you.", "NTA, you put up with him enough, he should have come himself if he cared for them.", "NTA. If they were so valuable and precious, he\u2019d have come to collect them himself. Depending on your jurisdiction, him abandoning them for so long may actually give you the legal right to sell or throw them out, so your decision to drop them off with their lazy rightful owner is actually pretty generous.", "NTA although to be totally in the clear you should have warned him what you were planning to do the last time you spoke to him , i.e. \"I need them out of the house this Saturday, if not I'll pack them up and put them on your doorstep/throw them out/donate them to charity\" etc. If you give him a final warning like that and he still doesn't pick them up then they become abandoned property and you can do what you want with them.", "How does he know they were damaged by you? Anything could\u2019ve happened to that box you left. Workmen could have tripped over it. You don\u2019t know and neither does he.\n\nETA - NTA \ud83d\ude42", "NTA. Your apartment is not his storage unit but he clearly tried to use it that way.", "Nta storage service is not free", "ESH\n\n> though also not using any wrapping material\n\nYou knew you were an asshole doing that\n\nYou broke stuff so you repay him minus the cost for 2 months rent.", "NTA. you did what you could do", "Respond that the storage fee is $500/week and the moving fee was an additional $1000. I\u2019d say he owes you $$$", "YTA Just pay him back for them.", "please explain more about what happened here.. If the figurines were some kind of stone, then not using wraping material is pretty stupid and it is not strange they got damaged in transport and he is mad.\n\nIf they where pastic, how the hell did they get broken?", "Out of curiosity what kind of figurines were they?", "No, if his stuff was there preventing you from renting the room, he should have been paying rent. \n\nHe abandoned the property and didn\u2019t come when you asked him. Tell him you will sue him for rent for not clearing out the room. NTA.", "NTA\n\nTell him he's lucky you're not charging him rent for all the time his stuff was in your apartment. Point out that this cost you money because you couldn't have a new tenant move in.\n\nIt's not your fault he failed repeatedly to pick up his belongings.", "NTA. Block him.", "INFO: Why didn't you use packing paper?", "YTA. I get being annoyed that he didn\u2019t get them when promised but it is one box of stuff. How much effort is it to wrap them in newspaper?", "I doubt they were broken tbh. I think Joe was trying to get some money out of op. If the figurines were broken op would have heard when moving the box . \n\nNTA anyway", "Absolutely the right answer. \n\nAlso\u2026 asking people to pay for things and claiming a certain resale value is 90% of the time ridiculous. People will go to eBay and find something listed at a certain price and claim that means that\u2019s the resale value. No, that\u2019s what some idiot is trying (and failing) to sell it for.\n\nIf they were worth anything to him, he\u2019d have picked them up. He just saw an opportunity to try and get some money out of you and is hoping you feel bad enough to not question it", "He also cost her potentially two months of rent because she couldn't have a new tenant move into his old room. She should send him a bill.", "Nope", "Why? Those are the natural consequences of his actions. He was asked for over a month to get his stuff from the apartment and he never bothered. He likely knew OP needed the space cleared for a new renter but instead decided to use him as free storage which is just selfish. If he cared so much about his precious figurines then he should have come and got them himself and not waited for OP to get sick of being messed around and dealing with it themselves", "If they are that valuable then he should have taken better care of them", "Why does OP owe him for something he should have taken care of himself?", "I honestly have no idea what kind of material they really are. Some were really solid plastic, some were heavy as stone but didn't feel like stone. Kind of felt like synthetic plastic-like stone if that's a thing? \n\nI did put them in the box carefully, but I admit I was also pretty much over it after having asked him to pick them up so often, that I didn't really go through any additional effort of buying plastic wrap to properly package them.\n\nHonestly didn't think they'd be so fragile since they felt pretty solid, but also didn't really feel like it was my responsibility to act as a moving service.", "Pretty much a big mix of all kinds of different figurines. Some were from games (I assume from collector editions), others were from movies and series. There was a lightsaber replica in there too.", "Exactly. OP didn\u2019t sign up for being someone\u2019s free storage unit, and was actually *losing* money from the lost potential to rent the room out.", "> Those are the natural consequences of his action\n\nPaying for things you damage is also a natural consequence of actions of being careless with others their property.", "Once he refused to pick it up for weeks, keeping OP \nfrom using her own space, I'd say it was abandoned property. You snooze, you lose."]}
