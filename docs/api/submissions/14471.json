I didn\u2019t have any shaving legs restrictions growing up, we asked around - my sister in law, my step mom, some friends and everyone said they were allowed to shave or their mom would help them to shave. \n\n\nWe had one more activity planned - going to water park and my step daughter refused because she ashamed to wear swim suit, she loves water parks though - my husband used to have whole membership thing in one for her. \nSo I offered to shave her legs and she agreed, I used high quality products and she loved the feel of smooth legs. \n\n\nHer mom saw her legs hairless and sent my husband very angry email calling us assholes.

If she's embarrassed to the point of being unable to enjoy herself or to be comfortable, then the mother is not being very understanding. And her dad is also her parent, so if he was fine with it, the mom can suck it up. It's not like you went behind both parents' back, and did it against the daughter's will.\n\nI was VERY self-conscious about my leg hair as a kid (also brunette with dark leg hair), so I can't imagine my mom not allowing me to shave when I was 12 frickin years old. It's like mom doesn't care that her 12yo is embarrassed at an already difficult age.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing this girl is in school and has PE lessons where\u2019s she\u2019s required to wear PE shorts with her leg hair on show infront of her whole class/school. School children are brutal when it comes to bullying.", "NTA. You saved this girl from feeling embarrassed and possible bullying. I'm so happy my mom plucked my crazy ass eyebrows at that age and taught me to shave", "NTA Every teen/tween gets to decide when those coming of age things are right for them. Eg. Wear a bra. Shave the legs. You had the support of her father, so you didn\u2019t overstep.", "NTA. It upsets me so much when parents ignore their kid\u2019s bodily autonomy. Your step daughter\u2019s mother needs to put her preferences aside and allow her daughter to start making these choices for herself. \n\nI\u2019m glad your step daughter has someone looking out for what she actually wants.", "NTA. I am dumbfounded by responses stating otherwise. She\u2019s 12 years old, which means middle school, not a small child. Her father gave permission. She\u2019s extremely self-conscious of her body and didn\u2019t want to participate in activities or even wear shorts. \n\nI can understand not wanting to rush your children into growing up too soon. But this is a very natural step in maturing. Frankly, OP helped her shave safely, which is much better than the daughter trying on her own and cutting her legs.", "NTA at all. Kids are *ruthless* at this age. My mom refused to let me shave or wear a bra and it was awful. She is doing her daughter a disservice. It's good you have your stepdaughter's best interests at heart.", "NTA. I was the 12 year old who wasn\u2019t allowed to shave my legs and it was fucking mortifying. Her father said it was ok.", "NTA. Man, I remember being 12 and crying in the shower because my mum thought I was too young to shave my legs. I wore jeans to school on the hottest day of the year because I was too embarrassed to have my legs show. (In fairness to my mother, I was also wayyy too embarrassed to tell her how much it bothered me and I'm sure she would have bought me a razor if she knew). The kid deserves to feel comfortable in her own body. But I hope you taught her how to do it instead of just doing it for her.", "NTA, 12 is a perfect age for learning about it if she wants to. You didn\u2019t force her, she wanted to know about it. Frankly it\u2019s much better that she learns from you than from her friends. \n\nI love how many Y T A responses there are. None of them have ever been a panicked preteen trying to figure it out on their own.", "NTA. Her body, her choice. You merely supported her choice.", "Knowing it\u2019s only shaving legs and not anything that requires a guardian\u2019s permission, the only consent you needed was from the person who owned the legs. NTA", "NTA, dad is equally a parent and okayed it.", "NTA. \n\nShe's 12 years old. She's hitting puberty, clearly. If she wants to shave her legs, she should be allowed to shave her legs. They're HER legs. \n\nI will never understand parents whop restrict their teens and tweens from doing completely age-appropriate things like shaving or trying out makeup. Barring any kind of sensitivity or allergy, kids should be able to express themselves and figure out what they like, especially at that age. \n\nMy mom used to tell me I wasn't allowed to shave above the knee (something that confuses me to this day). I have PCOS, and I have very dark hair. I did it anyway and, when she got mad, I told her that I wanted to. I think she was concerned in a \"Who are you shaving for?\" kind of way which is... Well. Gross.", "NTA - honestly horrified at the number of people here that think parents should have a say over their kids body hair.  Only the child should have a say about her OWN body hair.", "NTA. My legs and arms always had thick dark hair. I wasn't allowed to shave it because \"body hair is natural\". It's natural, but when kids go around the school calling you gorilla because of it, it causes you to hate it. She was embarrassed by it and she was missing out on activities kids loved all because of an overly controlling rule.", "NTA. She\u2019s old enough to make that decision, and her mom is setting her up for bullying. She wanted to shave her legs, and I don\u2019t blame her, smooth legs are great. \n\nI am curious, do we know why she is so against it?", "NTA\u202612 year old hairy, brunette me would have been over the moon to have someone like you looking out for me!\n\nWhat the heck is the deal with the mother?! 12 years old is more than old enough to be shaving her legs. No kid wants to stand out at that let alone for something they can be teased about.", "NTA. At the end of it you did what she wanted and she 12. That's plenty old enough to know what you want. Simply put though, any situation like this the ex will always find a way to be upset. Kinda the job of an ex really \ud83e\udd23", "Gonna go with NTA.  I feel for this girl - my dad\u2019s side of the family is of Mediterranean descent, and as a result I\u2019ve always had fairly hairy legs and arms, and it was noticeable.  The first time I ever shaved my legs I was around 8 or 9 and used my mom\u2019s razor.  My mom found out and just bought me my own, and that was that.  Gatekeeping your child\u2019s body hair is weird - let them make the decision to shave or not for themselves.", "NTA, however, this is also a good opportunity to discuss that just because society expects you to shave your legs, you don\u2019t have to. I think at 12 it\u2019s important to start making choices, but no choices are made in a vacuum. She needs to be able to learn how to do things safely too", "NTA. I was this kid, and was eternally grateful to the friend\u2019s mom who realized why I wouldn\u2019t go in their pool or to the beach with them in the summer, and gave me a razor and showed me how to shave when I was 13. Up until then the teasing I endured in gym class or when I was forced to wear shorts was horrible. Your stepdaughter is lucky to have you.", "NTA. I had those restrictions as well but I just went ahead and shaved my legs anyways. My parents never noticed but I wasn\u2019t/ am not hairy to the point where it\u2019s noticeable.", "NTA\n\nFlat out, I don't care if people want to debate custody, her mom is emotionally stunting her verging on abuse for whatever reason.  Shaving legs isn't an issue and the whole thing is F37 decided she wants a baby and not a 12 year old tween girl.  If she can't handle that, she can fork over full custody to F32 and her husband.  Honestly, it sounds more and more like the daughter is going with them anyway.", "NTA. \n\nMy mom wouldn\u2019t let me shave my legs and eventually I started doing it myself. \n\nHer mom is ruining her self esteem not allowing her too and at that age, it should be her choice.", "NTA. My mom also wouldn\u2019t let me shave for the longest time. I ended up stealing one of her old razors and eventually doing it myself which in hindsight was rather gross. She refused to admit I was growing up and also wouldn\u2019t buy me bras. My friend gave me one. It\u2019s abusive and so embarrassing to go through life with these issues because your parent refuses to acknowledge it\u2019s time to allow you to do certain things or is just plain too lazy to take the time.", "NTA.\n\nMy mom was super weird about this too. I was not allowed to shave and I played sports where I had to wear shorts. I got teased ALL THE TIME. Finally, a friend's mom showed me how to shave during a sleepover. Yes my mom was pissed but so what. It's my body. And my mom gave me other weird hang ups about stuff like you can wear a swimming suit out of the water (like sunbathing), etc.\n\nPeople saying your hair grows back darker and thicker - that's a myth. Hair grows from within the hair follicle inside the skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Can't wear a swimsuit, not can. My mom was nuts.", "NTA. Husband was okay without. She can enforce her bizarre rule at her house if she wants.", "NTA-As a very hairy person, I used to sneak razors onto the school bus and dry shave in a moving vehicle because my mother was anti shaving. In theory, your stepdaughter should be able to feel confident and comfortable in shorts or a bathing suit without shaving but lets be real. Adults have a hard time with it, why is a 12 year old expected to do better? And at the end of the day, it\u2019s just hair. It\u2019s gonna grow back and her mother can attempt to put the horse back in the barn on her time.", "NTA.  My step-mom was like this with shaving legs, wearing fashionable clothing, and wearing makeup.  My dad had full custody, my mom had visitation a few times a year.  My mom bought me stylish clothes, taught me how to put on makeup, and let me shave at 11 years old/6th grade.  All perfectly age appropriate.  I know exactly how this poor girl feels, I also know that for a very long time I was much closer to my mother than my dad because of this.  Keep advocating for that child to be able to make choices about her body and how she chooses to feel comfortable navigating this world, jr high and high school are hard enough.  BTW, I'm 42 years old and a married mother of 2.", "As a stepmom and bio mom myself I see both sides. NTA. The mom can't call the shots on this. This is the child's decision.", "NTA, Joint custody means Dad can make those decisions when the child is with him.  Shaving legs isn't like getting ears pierced.  Leg hair will grow right back in a few weeks if Mom doesn't like it.  Heck when I was that girls age I would have said \"oh, no shaving\" and promptly gone about plucking every hair out one by one.  Technically not shaving.", "NTA, considering you got her dad\u2019s permission. If it was really causing her this much embarrassment, I think it was a reasonable thing to do. I started shaving my legs around 10-11 or so, personally. \n\nAnd leg hair grows back (it\u2019s a myth that it\u2019s thicker, it just feels pricklier for a while), so if her mom is really going to die on this hill it\u2019s a very temporary change.", "NTA.\n\nUnsurprisingly, a large portion of commentors don't think girls should have bodily autonomy. \n\nIf the kid wants to wear makeup, you should let her do that too. I've been the child in these custody battles between parents that hate each other and honestly, when I was able to make decisions about the clothes I wore and the hair styles I wanted, I had a higher self worth and esteem. My sister who was involved in it was much happier when she got to be herself and do what she wanted with her looks as well.   \n\n\nIt is absolutely miserable living with parents that do not allow you basic autonomy in dress and appearance and are unwilling to even negotiate.", "NTA, I was bullied at school because I was not allowed to shave armpits and legs (also not allowed to wear bra's) and it was a nightmare. Good for you to help her!", "NTA-she was missing out on fun things because of her moms unreasonable rule. I'm assuming the dad here was ok with it.", "NTA I was not allowed to shave my legs when I was younger and I had a field trip to a waterpark at the end of middle school. I remember stealing one of my dads disposable ones, waking up super early and shaving before school because I was really embarrassed and scared of going out in a swimsuit with hairy legs. I probably missed some spots but I definitely felt less self conscious.", "NTA - I had a friend in school with a similar issue who was very self conscious because she wasnt allowed to shave. It hindered her from doing a lot of things she normally wouldve loved to do. I just cant imagine what kind of A-hole parent wouldnt allow their child to shave once it came time for them to do so...", "NTA\n\nDid your stepdaughter consent? Yes. That's all that matters. If she feels happier with shaved legs, that's her prerogative.", "NTA - she wanted it and had at least one parent backing her. That's more than enough for something that is exclusively her body. Good job for showing her how to do it right.", "Easy NTA it dosen't matter if it's your kid or not when you realise a little kid getting insecurity at a young age anyone would step in.", "NTA my kid started at 8 because of swimming. Kids can be cruel at that age and it makes them uncomfortable. 12 is that age where she'll want to start dressing different doing eyebrows painting nails etc.. her dad needs to have a conversation with her mom and let her know it's time to listen to what the kid wants and is comfortable with", "NTA: The child's parent granted consent.", "NTA, it is her body so she should choose what to do with it. The only thing I would have done differently is tell her that having hairy legs is perfectly fine too! It is her choice ultimately, but I would just want to make it clear that it is also totally fine to go to a water park with hairy legs too.", "NTA because not being allowed to shave your legs is bullshit. The amount of hair on your legs has nothing to do with sexualization. Some people have hairy legs, some people don't. The trend is and has been for a LONG time that hairy legs isn't cool. \n\nI'm a hairy ass beast that grew up in a 90% white town. I shaved my legs for awhile, because people commented on it. Then I decided I didn't care and stopped. I can't imagine growing up not being allowed to.", "NTA. She wanted her legs shaved, it\u2019s her body. On top of that, her father said it was okay.", "NTA. 12 year old me was nicknamed \u201cape\u201d. Mum actually admitted she left it too long when I came home crying about it for the third day in a row. Was the mother was unaware of the teasing?", "NTA- So long as husband was in agreement. Sounds like it\u2019s between him and his wife how to discuss and deal with these things but I sounds like your husband was in agreement with you.", "NTA, though I do agree with others it\u2019s weird you talked to so many people and not her mom, who actually mattered here. But you did have permission from a parent and more importantly, your step-daughter *wanted* to shave. Getting some perspective on her reasoning may have been good (though really it would be better for your husband to talk to her on this particular issue). \n\nTwelve is old enough to have some reasonable bodily autonomy and she shouldn\u2019t be missing out on fun things over her mom forbidding that. I do think it should be emphasized that shaving is a BS beauty standard and something she should only do if she WANTS to rather than because society expects it, but it\u2019s not like YOU were the one pressuring her. She felt pressured by her peers, and she\u2019s the one who has to deal with any negative consequences. Her mom was being ridiculous, and frankly forbidding her from shaving or making that decision herself is *also* damaging. \n\nAnd frankly if YOU didn\u2019t do this, she probably eventually would have found another way to. I didn\u2019t even ask or tell my mom when I started shaving. I just did it, and I was also 12.", "NTA her mom is an idiot who\u2019s reminds me of my own", "You\u2019re technically the asshole. But sometimes it takes an asshole to do something right. NTA", "NTA-it\u2019s his kid too.", "NTA.", "NTA.   I dealt with similar circumstances when I was her age decades ago.  Teased relentlessly in middle school gym class.  \n\nDad signed off, you're in the clear.", "NTA. this girl is 12 and clearly wants to shave her legs. you helped her feel confident in her body and able to be comfortable so she could do the activities everyone was going to do. i\u2019m sure regardless what her parents think, she will really appreciate that", "NTA\n\nBoth the mom and the dad get input on how she lives her life. IMHO, that was an unreasonable demand from mom.  Let her be angry.", "NTA\nIt's leg hair, it will grow back very quickly. The real issue now is your husband needs to talk to his ex wife about her being overly controlling with her daughter when she's almost a teenager. What's next, she's not allowed to wear a bra, or deodorant, or tampons? This can't be allowed to continue, as a child that will be in high school soon she should be allowed to have basic bodily autonomy.", "NTA as long as her dad gave permission.", "NTA", "NTA mom is too controlling dad said it was ok", "NTA - My grandma did this for me around the same age because my mom had this weird rule, too. Except it wasn't just my legs that terrorized me (I grow incredibly thick dark hair on pale skin). My ARMPITS. I would wear 3 quarter inch sleeves or jackets religiously to avoid anyone seeing my hairy armpits. It was miserable. All outdoor activities in the summer were miserable. \n\nFinally, my grandma had enough of my insecurities around swimming and taught me how to shave.", "NTA. You asked her mom, and she didn't list that. Also, at that age, she's likely getting mocked mercilessly. I have two daughters. One is a blonde, the other brunette. The blonde is older (10), but her hair is so light that no one notices, and she therefore hasn't asked about her legs. The brunette is 7 and has mentioned it, but when we talked about it (I talked out why she mentioned it, body confidence, and shaving maintenance), she was no longer interested. I'm thinking maybe around 10 or so, but I'm taking it as we go because every kid and their situation is different.", "NTA. I think that at that age she is starting to be able to make some decisions for herself. While it is unfortunate that she feels this pressure (thanks society!) I think she deserves to develop autonomy over things like this at this age. I commend you for helping her, even if you\u2019re just stepmom.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who started going through puberty early on, I will never forget how awful and alienated I felt. I really feel for this girl. Especially nowadays where bullying has gotten to a who new level.\n\nPlus, between friends and the internet it was only a matter of time before this girl tried to figure it out herself. Having one bio parent's support and an experienced adult present is a much better scenario.", "INFO: Do we know why BioMom doesn't approve of shaving legs? Is it a hippie naturalist thing? I get not forcing her to shave, but if the kid is distressed and embarrassed about it I would want to help her out too.", "Nta. I had the same rule growing up. I was teased relentlessly and ended up shaving my legs by myself. I skinned/cut myself very deep, and still have multiple scars from it. \n\nThis rule didn\u2019t stop me and all it accomplished was making me endure the teasing longer than I should have.", "NTA\n\nYou involved her dad in the decision making and asked the opinions of other relatives too.\n\nThe girl made it known that a cosmetic situation was upsetting her to the point of wanting to skip an experience that she likely loved just to avoid feeling ashamed over something minor.\n\nObviously the hair is going to grow back so it is not a permanent change.  When her hair does grow back, then her mother can either lighten up on the shaving rules, or help her daughter figure out that hairy legs are not the end of the world and that she is perfect either way.", "NTA.\n\nThe mother is borderline abusive with this rule, letting a child, especially one who is almost a teenager, have agency over their own body is important. \n\nIf it\u2019s what she wants to do, she should be allowed to do it - albeit with proper safety instruction and supervision", "NTA. As someone who WAS bullied over leg hair,  my own aunt had to gift me shaving things during Easter when i was 13 in order for my mom to realize i both needed and wanted to shave. It would be one thing if you cut her hair without mom's permission or forcefully shaved her against your step daughter's wishes, that'd be a whole other ball park. But she was missing out on super fun activities because she was too self concious and likely had been bullied severely already by her peers.  It's not like the hair wont grow back (damn puberty lol)  heck she could even do what most women do.  Shave for summer and not winter.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nMy daughter is 12 I just asked her yesterday if she wanted/needs to shave her legs. ( She has been shaving pits for a while)\n\nShe was like, yea, but I dont wanna have to deal with the upkeep lol.\n\nAnyway, point is she is old enough to make that decision for herself. Especially since its preventing her from doing fun activities she loves.", "NTA", "NTA, the main concern here is you asked your step daughter and she consented. She also enjoyed it. Good job checking your boundaries, but her bio mom is on a control/power trip.", "NTA!", "NTA but pro tip, If she thick coarse dark body hair she\u2019s way better off sticking to strictly waxing. \n\nUnless ya\u2019ll are willing to pay for her to get laser, then she can stick with shaving. One can start laser around 14 or so. \n\nShaving is just such a challenging way to maintain thick dark body hair in the long run.", "NTA.

She wore jeans or long skirts every summer because she was so embarrassed. She wasn\u2019t allowed to wear makeup until she graduated and that just led to her doing it in secret and washing it all off before going home.

I don't shave above the knee because I don't need to. Below the knee, the hair grows in a bit sparse but very visible because I have fair skin and dark hair, ditto my armpit hair, but the hair on my thighs is thin and light coloured, so I usually don't shave it because you can barely see it.

I still taking weekly swim lessons at the time and that was my main motivation for shaving my bikini line. She did eyes the hell out of every time I said I wasn\u2019t sexually active after that. I wasn\u2019t and I wouldn\u2019t be until years after I couldn\u2019t go to a pediatrician any more.

As a mom of three girls, I'm doing what I can to make that easier.", "Second grade!?! Wow how sad :(", "Oh my God! Second grade? That is young. Definitely something they heard from an older sister or something, because I\u2019ve never heard of a 6-7 year old shaving their legs.", "and sports straight up unbearable without support", "Similar situation. Never thought about my thick, dark eyebrows slowly merging Frida Kahlo style until a friend pulled me aside and mentioned some of the other girls were mocking me for it behind my back.", "Oh God I did this before and had my mom draw it on for a month", "Father's aren't parents /s.", "I went through years (2-3?) of bullying, up to and including being called a werewolf, because my mom refused to permit me to shave. Ultimately, she tossed a disposable razor through the bathroom door one night when I was bathing and said, \"You'll figure it out.\" It took two more years, and being bullied by my older sister, before I could shave properly. I was 16 by the time it was all said and done, and I still have nightmares about it.\n\nHard, *hard* NTA.", "Amazing doctor. Glad you had him.", "Wow, I\u2019m so sorry you went through that at that age. I\u2019m glad the doctor supported you. It\u2019s hard enough being 12/13! I had the opposite - I was basically forced into using tampons at age 12 because that\u2019s all we had in the house one night when I got my period for the 3rd or 4th month ever, and my mom said \u201cI\u2019m not going to the store at 9 pm to buy you pads, the tampons are in the closet, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out but ask me if you have questions.\u201d I was so furious at the time - I didn\u2019t want to use tampons yet - but to be honest I quickly realized they were so much better than the alternative. I remember being teased in school when a girl saw them in my purse, it was embarrassing but that\u2019s life when you\u2019re that age, one long string of horribly embarrassing situations. At least it seemed that way. \n\nSo glad I\u2019m not 12/13, those were some rough years.", "My mom wouldn\u2019t let me wear tampons either up until 16. She said \u201cyou\u2019re not old enough.\u201d I said \u201cthe nurse at school said we can.\u201d I just did it anyway without telling her", "Oh my god - I love your grandmother. She sounds so badass.", "When I was in year 8, so 12/13, there was this boy in class who was growing facial hair. I remember asking him why he didn't shave. He wasn't allowed to shave until he turned 16. That's absolutely ridiculous. He was just hitting puberty faster then our peers, I also hit it faster then my peers so I had similar issues with my mum and a stolen razor I used on my legs and underarms.", "I have very light, sparse leg hair that's only visible when you reeeeealy look close at my legs, but I still got bullied for having leg hair in middle school.", "That\u2019s funny I wasn\u2019t either once I hit high school. I was able to do whatever I want but in middle school I wasn\u2019t allowed to shave above my knees I always found this funny and thought that maybe it was a cultural thing. My mother is French Morrocan and we\u2019re Jewish I don\u2019t know I attributed to that.", "My oldest grandson (17) has had a moustache for a couple of years. Last year his uncle taught him how to shave & trim his beard. He keeps it neat & trimmed & it looks good on him. (He likes having facial hair. I like it the way he keeps it. His Mom wasn\u2019t a fan but she doesn\u2019t mind if it\u2019s neat)", "My mom didn\u2019t want me to shave for as long as possible and I was a kid who went through puberty early, bad combo! Add in me being tall and ungainly with a bad center part and I looked like Shaggy\u2019s loser friend. But with my own kid now, I see why it was hard for her. That\u2019s said, I never want to impede my kid or make things harder for them just to save my own feelings.", "My leg hair is really blonde and I rarely shaved above the knee because you could barely see it.  In our early 20s a friend criticized me for having some noticeable blonde hair on the back of my thighs, wearing shorts, so I kept a better eye on it.  Then we went swimming together for the first time - - she had a massive BUSH hanging out at her bikini line!  I never said a word. (She was wearing a one piece; is it still called the bikini line?)", "Only strippas shave above the knee! The good ones, anyway.", "Hahaha, man, my mom roasted me so hard when I did it. I used brown eyeshadow and it probably looked so, so janky. Growing up is not a graceful time, lol.", "Shaving your legs isn't a major thing in terms of the action though. (will likely have a major impact on child's self confidence)", "It's shaving legs not chopping of 12 inches of hair from her head.  Worst case is no one even notices for the week it takes to grow back.  The mom was way overreacting.", "Have you tried an epilator? They're not much fun to use, but it lasts longer than shaving and is less irritating than waxing. \n\nOf course, it's a mechanical hair puller, so it's not a lot of fun.", "I have a toddler with eczema who needs lotion daily. He hates lotion, and I've tried plenty different kinds, but I have to give it to him. Recognizing that children aren't adults and aren't responsible enough to make some decisions, and doing what you have to regardless of their wishes does not equate to treating them as less than human.", "We didn\u2019t have any such rule in place on my team, I was pretty much the only girl who didn\u2019t shave their legs on my team. I\u2019ve never heard of such a rule, banning female swimmers from shaving during their puberty years. (Not discounting that you had that rule, but that\u2019s pretty messed up to do to a kid in their formative bullying years)", "Yes, it's definitely selfish. Kids can be so cruel about these things. Trying to keep your kid young for a little bit longer isn't worth it if it means your kid is getting bullied because of it.", "Absent father + codependent mother = enmeshed child. This is a very common form of emotional abuse.", "I'm 37 and my mom still insists that the reason that I have thick leg hair is because I started shaving too early (last out of all my friends, at like 13).\n\nSure mom, it has nothing to do with the fact that you married a giant Lithanian man \ud83d\ude44", "My mom also used body hair and even my hair on my head to control me. For her it wasn't about doing the right thing for me, it was about her being able to prove that she was in charge. I'm 100% with you that this is a huge red fucking flag. \n\nControlling someone's body is always wrong. Especially when you're not doing it for any reason other than your own selfish gains.", "I smell emotional abuse and it stinks", "Omg I was the same... I'm not allowed? Okay I'm going to do it anyway in \"secret\"...!", "I was blonde and still got bullied for not shaving my legs at 14 cause I wasn't allowed and it took until I skinned my knee and used all my sister's shaving cream for them to realize it's time to let me", "The mom probably will try to be controlling about those things too. Like banning all menstrual devices other than pads and absolutely no dating until a certain age.", "We got a electric razor for our 9 year old! You can't really cut your self and is easy enough for her to do.", "My Italian aunt used to burn off the hair on her forearms over the gas stove flame, the way you would for chicken legs.", "Omg sex before marriage leads to dances \ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23  did you go to school in Utah?

When in reality the whole point of being \"progressive\" is that people have a right to, in this case, shave or not shave depending on what they choose, without judgment.", "Eschewing gender stereotypes and patriarchal standards of beauty is a liberal thing though.", "My dad told me that and damn was he right! Just grateful I live in a time when beards are acceptable.", "Contact local school, recreation departments, or college that has college for kids and see if you can volunteer. Either you will love kids or that will help you decide that you do NOT want to change your life completely.  You can NEVER go back, and you will be a parent for the rest of your life.  I have friends in their 60's who have kids in their 40's and they are more worried and stressed over their 40 year old kids than they were back when their children were teens.  Go take the classes on becoming a foster parent.  I'm not suggesting you be a foster parent, unless your heart really points you that way.  I want you to learn all the things that people who are dealing with children who have issues know.  Your children may be wonderful, but they will be exposed to kids at school or in sports, or other places that have the full gamut of being on the spectrum, neurodivergent, and worse is trying to help your child learn and cope when there are children in their classes that have behavior disorders because they were born addicted.  \n\nNext, finances:  Go to your local store that sells children's clothing and make a list of prices for everything you think your child will need for each season.  Are you going to stay at home or will you need child care because you work?  Check out the prices of child care.  \n\nIf you can't tell, I chose to not become a parent and the only thing I think I regret is that I don't have an heir who wants my stuff.   But then, my friends who have several children tell me that their kids don't want their stuff either.  Some people think being a parent is wonderful, some don't.

Now I want to shave my legs and buy satin sheets. Or try it with freshly shaven balls", "It\u2019s not entirely true, shaving obviously doesn\u2019t change how the roots work.
