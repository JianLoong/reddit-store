We went to a doctor, and unfortunately found out Charlie is infertile. We were devastated. Enter my husbands cousin \u201cDavid\u201d. When he found out about Charlie\u2019s infertility (they\u2019re very close and grew up together so they share everything), David mentioned he donates to sperm banks, and if we were interested could donate to us. My husband and I discussed it, and we loved the idea- my husband thought it would be amazing if the baby was related to him biologically. We did the necessary and I\u2019m now 7 months pregnant with a baby girl!\n\nAnyway, it was my IL\u2019s wedding anniversary last week, and the whole family was invited. David was traveling for the last 6 months so we haven\u2019t seen him for a while and were excited to see him at the party. I texted him \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting forever to see you + show you my baby bump.\u201d He texted me back \u2018can\u2019t wait to see my child\u2019 as a joke.\n\nWe got to my IL\u2019s house a few hours early, so there wasn\u2019t anyone there, just my MIL, FIL, and SIL \u201cRose\u201d (F32). When I came in, I noticed Rose wasn\u2019t really talking to me but I assumed she was just shy( we haven\u2019t talked much, she lived abroad while my husband and I were dating and I met her at the reception for the first time. We\u2019ve met a few times since but it\u2019s been formal). I tried to help but my MIL told me to sit down. Rose muttered something at me but I didn\u2019t catch it.\n\nAfter all the guests arrived, we had lunch. After, Rose said she had something to say. She stood up and pointed at me and said I was a cheater. People stared at me but she kept on talking, calling me a whore who wanted Charlie\u2019s money and how I got pregnant with his cousin like a cheap slut. My FIL told her to STFU but she took out her phone and waved screenshots of David\u2019s messages (idk how she got them). Rose called David a manwhore. She started ranting about how she wouldn\u2019t let me get away with scamming her poor brother and said people of my kind were always thieving freaks. I\u2019ll admit I kinda cried. My husband saw and got mad and yelled that he was infertile and that David donated sperm to us and was she happy she outed him. My FIL kicked her out at this point and sent the rest of the guests home. \n\nA few days later, Rose called me to talk-she told me that she didn\u2019t mean to make a scene. I said it was ok. Then she asked me why I let her get embarrassed; if I knew that I wasn\u2019t cheating why didn\u2019t I say anything and let her get embarrassed. Just then Charlie came into the room and heard and told her to fuck off. She called us assholes and said her parents are reaming her out just \u2018for looking out for her baby brother.\u2019\n\nI feel bad about the whole thing and feel like I handled this horribly.

She wanted to be the heroic big sister and she wanted to embarass you and humiliate you.\n\nIf she cared about her brother, as opposed to caring about drama, she would've spoken to him directly and said he was worried about him and didn't like how you were pregnant with someone else's baby.

She didn't discuss it privately with her brother (the \"victim\"), but instead chose to make *him* a public spectacle. She made wild accusations about your motivation for cheating, following up with aspersions about your entire racial or cultural group.\n\nIt's bizarre that she would claim that she didn't intend to make a scene... Of *course* she meant to make a scene. She just thought that everyone would be on her side and she would wind up being hero.\n\nNTA, but you are missing something very important: she didn't do this to humiliate *you*. She did this because she believed that it was the only way to coerce her brother into leaving you. She thought that, even if your husband knew that you had cheated on him and were carrying someone else's baby, he would stay with you. She couldn't allow that... She couldn't allow him to make his own decisions because she knows the truth about \"people like you\". \n\nShe thought that the only way to make sure he left you was to have the rest of the family pressure him to do it. And she wasn't even sure she could get their parents on board with pressuring him to leave you, that's why she had to do it in front of guests, so her parents would feel the pressure from the guests to then put pressure on your husband.\n\nYou can forgive her for what she did to *you*... That's your choice (personally, I wouldn't, because she hasn't apologized yet and is blaming you for *her* bad behavior). But she didn't just do this to you.

Her intentions come of as if trying to humiliate you, your husband and David. Eventually it backfired on her. No need to feel sympathy for her plight. Your husband and in-laws are right. \n\nHow did she get access to your messages? Did she have access to your phone or David's? Who was she spying on and why did she doubt in the first place? It seems like she was snooping where she shouldn't and came to her own conclusions. And maliciously decided to cause drama. That should tell you she deserves this.", "NTA. She had partial information that led her to form a pretty fundamentally wrong conclusion about the situation. That's not your fault. \nShe'd clearly been snooping on her brother's phone. \nShe was ranting, shouting etc, refused to quiet down, to the point that she was ejected from the gathering by her own family member. That's not your fault. \nYou are pregnant and hormonal. \nShe presumably had time to think what she was going to say, & sprung it on you/the group. Her decision. \n\nI'm confused why she is accusing you of \"letting her get embarrassed\" & calling you an asshole. She should be ashamed of her behaviour but instead it sounds like she's refusing to take responsibility for her own actions, in her mind it's your fault for not somehow shutting her stream of nasty invective down. Would she have listened anyway - if she was so worked up she had to be ejected from the gathering, was she really in a listening mood? Doubt it.\n\nHold your head high. She needs to grow up & own her actions, and stop snooping. She embarrassed herself.", "Ummm what do you have to feel bad about? Someone was snooping on someone\u2019s phone they shouldn\u2019t have been messing with. Then someone decided to make a big scene at a family event and confront you for literally doing nothing.

You are the victim!!!", "NTA \n\nthis is entirely on you SIL, she could have handled this very differently. She could have talked to you privately or you and you\u00b4re husband alone.

Your SIL is definitely TA - she wanted to cause a scene, otherwise she would have spoken to her \"little brother\" on the side and quietly. She wanted to be loud and bombastic and embarrass you (no matter what BS excuse she is using now). She got her comeuppance and it was deserved.", "Wait wait, \"people of my kind were always thieving freaks\" are you a different ethnicity than the in laws? Becaue ooh boy, that would add a whole extra level of AH on her. \n\nYou're NTA, she was the one who did a big reveal scene like she was agatha christie, so her grave was dug by herself.", "NTA. Your stupid SIL embarrassed herself by creating a scene.", "NTA, no where close to one.  Please listen to your husband and in-laws....Rose is massively in the wrong here and is an adult.  If she wanted to not embarrass herself and cause a scene she should have talked to you or Charlie in private, not intentionally cause drama which is exactly what she did. \n\nCongratulations on your baby, just enjoy this time with your hubby.  Please avoid Rose until she is ready to take ownership for her actions and honestly just follow hubby's lead on when to talk to her again.", "You did not handle this horribly. She did. She made assumptions and embarrassed herself. She entirely did intend to make a scene and that's what she did. She then phones you and in effect blames you for her behaviour and for embarrassing herself. That is not \"ok.\" And what does she mean by \"your kind?\" You have nothing to feel bad for. You did nothing wrong. Don't allow her to transfer her culpability for her poor behaviour to you. Give yourself some space from her. NTA.", "NTA \n\nWhy do you feel bad? If her own brother didn\u2019t tell her the whole situation, why is  that on you? Who announces that their sister in law is cheating on their brother like that?", "If she cared about her brother and not about being the hero she wouldn't have made her announcement so publicly. She wanted the drama and was aiming to hurt you. Also even if you were cheating she still would have been a AH. What a wretched way to tell someone your being cheated on. She embarrassed herself and was acting like a child intent on getting attention. Thats not in any way shape or form on you. NTA", "NTA she was perfectly ok embarrassing you. She is gross and unhinged you need space from her. She has hurt and embarrassed your husband without a second thought.", "Hey, isn't that what good, looking out family does? Instead of talking with the people in private about what you've found out and what your concerns are, you jump on a platform in a public space and come out with your wild accusations?\n\nAnd of course it's your fault for not seeing this coming.... .\n\nI would definetly not talk with that person again, bad days are bound to come.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  SIL was.  She thought she could be drama queen for a day, and got caught in her own ambush.  You did nothing wrong and are paying a heavy penalty for her behavior.\n\nIt wasn't \"all right.\"  She viciously attacked you in front of the entire family.  I'm glad you have the strength to forgive her, but it is NOT all right.", "NTA. I love the \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to make a scene\u201d when she stands up to testify like Jerri Blank at a high school assembly.", "NTA she didn\u2019t mean to make a scene even though she tried to expose you in front of everyone. Also I\u2019ve never heard of more of a victim complex.", "NTA", "Picture to yourself for a second how it would have gone if you had stood up and said \"I am not cheating\", would her response have been \"oh I am so sorry, I should not have said that\", no she would have carried on as she did. Clearly she has a deep seated dislike of you, for whatever reason, and has been waiting for any kind of excuse to behave in this way. Like others, what stands out for me is how did she get hold of the text, how tech savvy is she? Could she have cloned your phone or put software on it to see private info? Could she have had access to screenshot stuff to send it to herself? I would be tossing my phone or getting some serious security software to scan it. NTA", "NTA. SIL's attempt for looking out for her brother would have been ok on a 1 on 1 environment between her and her brother, but I'd be willing to let that slide, but blaming YOU for her idiocy after obviously hurting you? Well that just yeeted her on asshole territory", "So when were you supposed to stop her, exactly? When she called you a whore, or maybe after she made you cry? She absolutely meant to make a scene. You did nothing wrong. NTA", "I'm what world would this ever make you an ah? \n\nI'd your sil a narcissist or have bpd because if she was looking out for baby brother and didnt want yo make a scene she would have done it another way. She went for maximum splash value and got splashed.\n\n\nCongrats on the baby girl", "LOL SHE STOOD THERE AND POINTED AT YOU IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. SHE DID IT ESPECIALLY AT A POINT EVERYONE WAS SITTING TOGETHER!!!! If she didn\u2019t want a scene she would have spoken to you separately, at most with the parents!! Like wtf this is CLEARLY to draw embarrassment and shame to you! She wanted to do to you OP, what happened to her. Plain and simple.\nNTA love", "NTA her full intention was to publicly humiliate you and cause you embarrassment. If it wasn\u2019t she would have handled if privately by pulling her brother to the side and showing him. But instead she waited until the party had started to air your \u201caffair\u201d and humiliate you. Instead she humiliated your brother and he had to reveal some private information. What she did was horrible and to be honest you are too kind. You need to cut contact with this person. She had no problems throwing you under the bus running over you then backing up and doing it a few 100 times. Please do not accept her apology or let her around your child.", "NTA at all. Are you a mind reader? Can you see into the future? Did SIL leave/drop hints about what she thought/was going to do, apart from possibly one inaudioable whisper? No. She, the one holding all the cards and the attack plan, could easily just have asked you herself in order to find out and stop herself. She just wants to push the feelings away from her, and so she's pinning them on you cause she can't be bothered to deal with them herself as an adult.", "NTA. If she didn't want to make a scene, she'd have taken the perceived victim, who she supposedly wanted to protect, out for tea and told him as gently and as quietly as possible. This woman wanted drama, and she got it!", "NTA she absolutely did mean to make a scene", "NTA. What were you supposed to do. Out your own husband for being infertile (something he obviously didn't want to discuss otherwise his family would have known), or refuse the texts that were obviously real? She had to talk to her brother like and adult and not cause a scene in front of the parents.", "I mean even if you knew she was planning this entire drama escapade and you approached her privately before hand to, as she puts it, \"tell her you weren't cheating\" she probably wouldn't have believed you and would've done it anyway. NTA. \n\n\nEdit to add that ontop of that if she really cared about her baby brother she would've approached him personally herself instead of screaming what she thought was going on to the entire family like a raving lunatic", "NTA. Don\u2019t tell her it is okay!", "What were you supposed to do predict the future? It's not like you knew she was going to stand up and make an announcement and start trying to humiliate you and the cousin in front of the whole family. I'm sure you all were probably in complete shock as it was happening and then what are you supposed to say? That's not the kind of thing that you say that's not true. Someone already tried to tell her to STFU and that didn't work she kept on going. She's a nosy Busy Body up in other people's business and she got put in her place. It's nobody's job to stop her from embarrassing herself it's her job to stop embarrassing herself. She needs to mind her  business!  NTA", "NTA. She tried to make an scene not help your husband if that was her intentions she would have talk to your husband or ILs in private not try to make an scene in front of everyone. NTA.", "Eh im kinda at NAH. Honestly even given the situation I would find it weird as fuck to have David texting my wife that he is \u201cexcited to see his baby\u201d", "Are you really asking if you are the AH in this situation. Really? mind blowing you need this kind of reassurance. NO, YOU ARE NTA.", "NTA\n\n>-she told me that she didn\u2019t mean to make a scene\n\n\ud83e\udd23 oh so THAT'S why she waited until everyone was there to make the announcement for her \"gotcha\" moment to out you in front of a crowd and humiliate you. Yeah makes perfect sense. How tf could you POSSIBLY be the AH for not preventing someone from doing an incredibly stupid thing you had no knowledge of. If she didn't wanna cause a scene she would've addressed this shit with her mutter. She's embarrassed as she should be. And good she got cut off, maybe she'll find a better way to occupy her time. If she has to work she she'll be to busy to meddle. Also though, how TF did she get your screenshots?", ">She started ranting about how she wouldn\u2019t let me get away with scamming her poor brother and said people of my kind were always thieving freaks.\n\nNot trying to make assumptions, but are you a POC by any chance? This feels like a really racially charged comment to me. NTA either way", "\"Why didn\u2019t 'you' say anything and let her get embarrassed?\"  Like she would have let you! Or believed you!\n\nShe wanted to be the hero and the good big sister.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong. You were minding your own business.\n\nNTA. (And please consider keeping Rose at a long arm's length from your new bundle of joy.)", "NTA. Just here to say that its weird reading the joking texts that her mind jumped straight to cheating... I mean she hardly knows you, could be a stupid joke even without the donating sperm. Normal thing to do is ask your brother in private, but I guess she already hated you or the cousin for some reason. And you should be more worried about how she got the texts bc thats creepy", "NTA", "NTA - but as a donor-conceived person myself, I worry she\u2019s going to bring it up in other unsavory ways in the future\u2026 god forbid in front of your child. My advice would be to get out ahead of it and make sure your child knows their conception story from a young age and that they have your full support and love. So if she ever decides to spew hatefulness about this in the future your child\u2019s mind hopefully goes right to \u201cThat\u2019s not right. My parents say I\u2019m normal, I belong, and I am loved.\u201d", "*woman punches you in the face*\n\n*everyone reacts like that was a shitty thing to do*\n\n\u201cWhy did you let me punch you in the face??\u201d\n\nNTA.", "NOOOOOOOO!!!! Not even close to the AH......she absolutely set out to destroy you and humiliate you in front of everyone. She was going for blood. Not only are you not the AH. But you should never ever ever ever ever speak to her again. She is a horrible human being. And stupid.", "NTA. She literally tried to sabotage your marriage and called you horrible names because of a text she somehow got a hold of. She didn't have context, she just ran with it. And instead of confronting you like an adult, she went for the most embarrassing route and didn't get the reaction she wanted - SHE ended up with egg on her face. That's not your fault.", "NtA.", ">said people of my kind were always thieving freaks.\n\nThis part really got me. What 'kind of people' is OP that SIL thinks they are 'always' thieves? I'm wondering is there is some racism or classism at play here as well - can't think of any other reason for this remark.", "Like... what the hell was she trying to do then?!?\n\n\nNTA", "If she didn't mean to make a scene she would have taken you aside in a private area and discussed what she discovered. Or pulled your husband aside and talked to him privately.", "Yep this. She definitely wanted to stirr up some drama in front of everyone and embarrass you OP. Even if you would have said something right away after the accusation, then still she wouldn't have believed you until your husband jumped in and told her the truth. \n\nIf she had been fair about it she would've gone privately to you and/or husband first, also explaining where she got the screenshots from(!) to back up as her 'evidence'.\n\nJust wondering did all your in laws know this pregnancy construction / infertility of your husband except for your SIL?\n\nNTA.", "She didn't just embarrass herself, she embarrased her brother too. Obviously op and her husband had not shared his infertility with most people and the sister forced him to reveal this. And there was really no outcome of sil's scene that wouldn't have embarrased her brother. Op should not be so forgiving for her husband being put in this situation by his racist sister, even if she can forgive sil for accusing her of cheating.", ">but you are missing something very important: she didn't do this to humiliate you\n\n\nWait a minute...even if what you said is true, why was the woman the one to come under her ire? Did she impregnate herself? Did she not know (if true) that her brother was also cheating with a married woman? \n\nWhy was it \"her poor brother?\" \n\nMiss me with that she did not mean to humiliate Op. She did", "Please have my award because... Just this, so much this", "Oh my gosh I totally forgot about the racist part, I was so focused on how SIL claimed to not want a scene but instead\u2026made a scene.\nOh my gosh even MORE NTA. She is clearly also a racist", "But first, OP needs to send some strongly worded text to - anyone - relating what SIL did, and stating that as SIL has very publicly accused her of infidelity and all sorts of other heinous behaviour, OP intends to sue the ass off SIL for slander - because given the number of witnesses, OP will definitely win the case.\n\nLet SIL's spyware have a dose of THAT little gem.", "When exactly were you supposed to interrupt her rant?", "That's what worried me, how could she have come across the messages in that time, it's really fishy like she's somehow  got access to OPs messages although that might just be me being paranoid", "At her parents anniversary of all days.", "\u201cDo the needful\u201d is a common phrase in India. It used to be in the UK as well, but I think it fell out of fashion there more.", "Living in the UK, my immediate thought would be Travellers or Romani. (I don't agree with the reputation but it's one that's very widespread)", "NTA.  It's not a joke and it's not funny, especially for your husband. Shut that shit down.", "Not just a regular family dinner, no less. A celebration of his parents marriage. No better time to tear down a loved one's marriage than during the celebration of another. Sister is nuts.", "Yeah that sounded not great. Racist? Classist?", "Exactly! \n\nAnd even if she had tried to correct her, she would have screamed/yelled over her that she's a liar and a cheater. \n\nIt wasn't her job to keep her from embarrassing herself - she's an adult who chose that family-filled moment to falsely accuse the poor pregnant lady who's just trying to make the best of a bad situation. \n\nNTA \n\nAlso, congrats on the baby and the understanding hubby and donating cousin!", "If she had been correct, it would have put a forever taint on the anniversary date for her parents and her brother. That is something you pull your brother and SIL aside for. I am not sure should you confront sil first, tell brother, etc but you don't make an announcement at a family gathering that is *supposed* to be about mum and dad.", "Could be both!", "You are so kind but you\u2019re giving too much credit to Charlie\u2019s sister.", "I hope so too. If you would prefer not to keep fighting with her maybe speak to Charlie about that part and discuss what a way forward would be if it is a race thing? \n\nBecause there's a balance between not wanting a fight and protecting your baby.\n\nE.g. she is never allowed to be alone with your child. You don't have to tell people they are never allowed to be alone with a child to not leave them alone with a child.", "I'm sorry, I genuinely am because it sucks to realize this about your husband's sister, but as a person with 40 years of experience and cynicism on this earth I would bet every last penny I have that it's racism.", "How is that *not* racist? Because it literally cannot be anything but racism.\n\nAlso, how the hell did she get those screenshots? I feel like you\u2019re glossing over that extremely important point.", "How did she get the text from Cousin? Did she do something to your phone?", "When I read that part I immediately assumed you and Charlie are interracial. There's no way that comment wasn't racist", "Also, she called you a cheap slut in front of everyone. To backpedal and say she didn\u2019t mean to make a scene is the dumbest shit imaginable. Stop telling her it\u2019s okay and making excuses. She\u2019s a racist asshole who set out to humiliate you and is playing the victim for her own extremely cruel and deliberate behavior.
