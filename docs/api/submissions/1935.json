We went to a doctor, and unfortunately found out Charlie is infertile. We were devastated. Enter my husbands cousin \u201cDavid\u201d. When he found out about Charlie\u2019s infertility (they\u2019re very close and grew up together so they share everything), David mentioned he donates to sperm banks, and if we were interested could donate to us. My husband and I discussed it, and we loved the idea- my husband thought it would be amazing if the baby was related to him biologically. We did the necessary and I\u2019m now 7 months pregnant with a baby girl!\n\nAnyway, it was my IL\u2019s wedding anniversary last week, and the whole family was invited. David was traveling for the last 6 months so we haven\u2019t seen him for a while and were excited to see him at the party. I texted him \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting forever to see you + show you my baby bump.\u201d He texted me back \u2018can\u2019t wait to see my child\u2019 as a joke.\n\nWe got to my IL\u2019s house a few hours early, so there wasn\u2019t anyone there, just my MIL, FIL, and SIL \u201cRose\u201d (F32). When I came in, I noticed Rose wasn\u2019t really talking to me but I assumed she was just shy( we haven\u2019t talked much, she lived abroad while my husband and I were dating and I met her at the reception for the first time. We\u2019ve met a few times since but it\u2019s been formal). I tried to help but my MIL told me to sit down. Rose muttered something at me but I didn\u2019t catch it.\n\nAfter all the guests arrived, we had lunch. After, Rose said she had something to say. She stood up and pointed at me and said I was a cheater. People stared at me but she kept on talking, calling me a whore who wanted Charlie\u2019s money and how I got pregnant with his cousin like a cheap slut. My FIL told her to STFU but she took out her phone and waved screenshots of David\u2019s messages (idk how she got them). Rose called David a manwhore. She started ranting about how she wouldn\u2019t let me get away with scamming her poor brother and said people of my kind were always thieving freaks. I\u2019ll admit I kinda cried. My husband saw and got mad and yelled that he was infertile and that David donated sperm to us and was she happy she outed him. My FIL kicked her out at this point and sent the rest of the guests home. \n\nA few days later, Rose called me to talk-she told me that she didn\u2019t mean to make a scene. I said it was ok. Then she asked me why I let her get embarrassed; if I knew that I wasn\u2019t cheating why didn\u2019t I say anything and let her get embarrassed. Just then Charlie came into the room and heard and told her to fuck off. She called us assholes and said her parents are reaming her out just \u2018for looking out for her baby brother.\u2019\n\nI feel bad about the whole thing and feel like I handled this horribly.

She wanted to be the heroic big sister and she wanted to embarass you and humiliate you.\n\nIf she cared about her brother, as opposed to caring about drama, she would've spoken to him directly and said he was worried about him and didn't like how you were pregnant with someone else's baby.

She didn't discuss it privately with her brother (the \"victim\"), but instead chose to make *him* a public spectacle. She made wild accusations about your motivation for cheating, following up with aspersions about your entire racial or cultural group.\n\nIt's bizarre that she would claim that she didn't intend to make a scene... Of *course* she meant to make a scene. She just thought that everyone would be on her side and she would wind up being hero.\n\nNTA, but you are missing something very important: she didn't do this to humiliate *you*. She did this because she believed that it was the only way to coerce her brother into leaving you. She thought that, even if your husband knew that you had cheated on him and were carrying someone else's baby, he would stay with you. She couldn't allow that... She couldn't allow him to make his own decisions because she knows the truth about \"people like you\". \n\nShe thought that the only way to make sure he left you was to have the rest of the family pressure him to do it. And she wasn't even sure she could get their parents on board with pressuring him to leave you, that's why she had to do it in front of guests, so her parents would feel the pressure from the guests to then put pressure on your husband.\n\nYou can forgive her for what she did to *you*... That's your choice (personally, I wouldn't, because she hasn't apologized yet and is blaming you for *her* bad behavior). But she didn't just do this to you.

Her intentions come of as if trying to humiliate you, your husband and David. Eventually it backfired on her. No need to feel sympathy for her plight. Your husband and in-laws are right. \n\nHow did she get access to your messages? Did she have access to your phone or David's? Who was she spying on and why did she doubt in the first place? It seems like she was snooping where she shouldn't and came to her own conclusions. And maliciously decided to cause drama. That should tell you she deserves this.", "NTA. She had partial information that led her to form a pretty fundamentally wrong conclusion about the situation. That's not your fault. \nShe'd clearly been snooping on her brother's phone. \nShe was ranting, shouting etc, refused to quiet down, to the point that she was ejected from the gathering by her own family member. That's not your fault. \nYou are pregnant and hormonal. \nShe presumably had time to think what she was going to say, & sprung it on you/the group. Her decision. \n\nI'm confused why she is accusing you of \"letting her get embarrassed\" & calling you an asshole. She should be ashamed of her behaviour but instead it sounds like she's refusing to take responsibility for her own actions, in her mind it's your fault for not somehow shutting her stream of nasty invective down. Would she have listened anyway - if she was so worked up she had to be ejected from the gathering, was she really in a listening mood? Doubt it.\n\nHold your head high. She needs to grow up & own her actions, and stop snooping. She embarrassed herself.", "Ummm what do you have to feel bad about? Someone was snooping on someone\u2019s phone they shouldn\u2019t have been messing with. Then someone decided to make a big scene at a family event and confront you for literally doing nothing.

You are the victim!!!", "NTA \n\nthis is entirely on you SIL, she could have handled this very differently. She could have talked to you privately or you and you\u00b4re husband alone.
