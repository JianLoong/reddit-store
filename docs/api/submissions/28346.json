Every year my family and I take a big trip and time of year depends on everyone's schedules. This year we collectively agreed for the second week in December. Those going on the trip include my husband Justin (33M) and I, our twin 2 year olds, my parents, and my brother, SIL and their 3 year old. My mom always makes all of the travel arrangements to ensure everyone is on the same flights, kids sit with parents, hotels are the same, etc. Everyone is on their own for getting to and from the airport at home, but car my mom makes car arrangements from the destination airport to the hotel and hotel to airport when leaving. While my mom makes the arrangements, my husband and I always Zelle/Venmo my mom for our portion of flights and hotels. My brother and SIL do the same thing.\r  \n\r  \nThis year everyone agreed to Disney World in Orlando. My mom as usual made all the reservations and what not about 2 months ago. My husband and I paid my mom our portion about a week after the reservations were made. Last night Adam texted husband asking if we had paid my parents yet. He said we had a while back. Adam then asked Justin if we could pay his family's portion of the trip. Not sure if everyone has been to Disney but it's ridiculously expensive these days. Justin told him we couldn't swing it with our budget at the time. We both work full time and make decent money but we don't have the kind of money that is just throw away. My brother and SIL both also work full time, and my nephew is not in daycare, my brother's mother in law watches him free, while we pay for 2 kids in daycare. Adam said responded with \"Well ok then.\" and quit texting him. \r  \n\r  \nQueue to this morning where I woke up to several texts from Adam calling Justin an asshole for nothing being a \"good brother\" and paying for their family. I told Adam I agreed with Justin and we just can't swing the money for them in our budget. I apologized and told Adam he was out of line for calling Justin an asshole and wouldn't stand for it. Adam again asked me to pay and said it could be our Christmas present to him, my SIL and my nephew. If I had the spare money to do it that way, I would, but I don't have the ability to do that, so I can't. I told him I couldn't do it and told him to reach out to our parents about a payment plan or something. Adam called Justin and I AHs and said we ruined their vacation. \r  \n\r  \nI'm kind of surprised by my brother's behavior, but are Justin and I the assholes here?", "created_utc": 1696614594, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171iwzw/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_brother_and_his/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, are you looking to adopt a new sister? :-)\n\nYour brother's definitely got some nerve, blaming y'all for ruining \"their\" vacation. How does he even think they have a vacation if they haven't paid for it?  Except your mom will probably just let him off the hook, right?

Your brother sounds pretty damned entitled to expect someone else to foot the bill for his, his wife's, and his kid's trip to go see Mickey.  Not your problem.  If they couldn't afford it, they should have raised the issue when the trip was being planned.  Either suggest an alternative that is more affordable, or just bow out of this trip all together.  They shouldn't raise the issue only after Mom had booked everything.", "NTA. If your brother couldn\u2019t afford to go, perhaps he should have brought it up during the planning phase.

Adam shouldn\u2019t have agreed to the trip if his family couldn\u2019t afford it. And expecting you guys to \u201cgift\u201d it to them is completely unacceptable.", "NTA turn it around and ask him to pay for yours and have it be an Xmas gift. He\u2019s being ridiculous. Also stop apologizing to him", "NTA - sounds like your brother is being pushy because he made promises he couldn\u2019t keep and is freaking out cause it\u2019s down to the wire. Either way, it\u2019s not your job to bankroll his issues. He\u2019s gotta fess up to mom and either pay her what he owes, ask for help, or back out of the trip. \n\nHave fun as Disney! Remember to pick up the Starbucks mugs in the am cause they sell out super fast!", "NTA\n\nBut Adam is. He\u2019s a big boy, and can either pay his own way or sit this one out. \n\nAt first I thought he wanted you to front him the money with plans to pay you back. Then I realized he expected a gift\u2014so double the AH.", "NTA. These kind of people blow my mind. How does entitlement like this develop? Was Adam completely spoiled growing up? Has he never had to live in the real world where things aren't just handed to him because he wants them? Wtf?", "The brother isn\u2019t entitled to going on an expensive trip. If he can\u2019t afford it and is desperate to go, then he can either finance it with a CC or sit this one out. It\u2019s just opening the door to hearing the same request every year. Pay for his vacation this year and you\u2019ll probably end up paying every year because you\u2019ll never hear the end of how you can pay for the trip as his Christmas gift. NTA", "NTA.  And even if you could afford it, it is **NOT** your responsibility to pay for your brother and his family to go on vacation.  Tell him you'll happily post pics for them to see. :)", "NTA.  Your brother left it to the very last minute in order to manipulate you into paying.  I have no doubt that he has known for a long time that he could not swing it financially.  He should have backed out BEFORE your parents made the bookings and paid for everything.  He is a major AH for leaving others with the bill.", "Not the asshole.\n\nBut going to Orlando and the land of the rat Good luck.", "NTA - make sure you tell your parents what he tried ASAP. Sounds like your parents likely paid for most, if not all of the trip. I bet mom asked him when he\u2019ll pay and then he came to you. \n\nHopefully he either figures it out and if they dont to your parents can get money or at least credit for a future trip.", "Info \n\nFirst I want to say you are not an AH. \n\nBut I am curious \n\nHave you ever paid for his family\u2019s part of any of these vacations? Has your brother ever expected you to fund his family like this? \n\nI\u2019m wondering where he got his audacity", "NTA. I mean, you know you aren't. I'd let your parents know what is going on so that if they need to get their money back for his family's portion, they can at least try to.", "NTA. Your brother's reaction seems really off to me. To your knowledge he always paid for previous vacations without any problems?  His reaction seems like he is desperate to replace money so SIL doesn't find out about financial issues. Like does he have a drug or gambling addiction or a side chick that money is being diverted to. My suggestion is talk to SIL and see if she even knows he asked you to pay for their vacations. Good luck.", "obviously NTA. Nobody has the right to demand someone else pay for their vacation. Your brother may be feeling stressed that he agreed to something he can't now pay for but that is NOT your problem.", "NTA, and don\u2019t apologize to him for not subsidizing their family\u2019s vacation.  He should be the one apologizing for his entitlement and subsequent behavior.", "You know you\u2019re not. Why is your brother so entitled? NTA.", "NTA by any means.  I don't understand your brother's entitled attitude to your money! He and his wife have zero childcare costs, while you pay for 2 kiddos. Perhaps it's time to remind him that holidays are discretionary spending and if he and his wife can't afford it, then they don't go this year! Please don't be guilted into paying, otherwise this will be the start of a slippery slope of money requests", "NTA\n\nWe went to Disney World in June 2022. We stayed at a Disney resort and only went to the Magic Kingdom. It was quite costly. The food isn't cheap, either. I recommend paying the extra for the refillable cups. \n\nAnyway, your brother and his family will have to miss out this year. It isn't your responsibility to pay their way. Maybe they can set up a payment plan with your mom if she is cool with it. Other than that... they're probably shite out of luck. Because they knew about the yearly or whatever vacation. They could have been squirreling away money for the trip.\n\nHave fun on your vacation.", "NTA\n\nHis request is so ridiculous that I don't understand how you can write this post instead of rolling in laughter...", "What the hell did I just read?? He called you both assholes because you wouldn't pay for him and his family to go on vacation? That's more than entitled, that's unhinged.\n\nNTA.", "NTA for setting completely reasonable boundaries, and refusing to (literally) double your cost of the trip. It\u2019s not your problem. Asking is one thing, but throwing a tantrum when he\u2019s told \u201cno,\u201d is not. If it\u2019s not doable, it\u2019s not doable and you do not owe him that type of expense. You made a great suggestion for them to reach out to parents to discuss a payment plan. Props to you for setting boundaries and keeping your cool!", "NTA you already told this mooch that you can't afford it and he keeps begging. Its not your job to pay for his familys way to disney.", "NTA - Has your brother always been such an entitled prick?", "NTA, but its time to reach out to your mom and tell her there seems to be a problem and that your brother has reached out twice for yall to cover their costs and when told you cant afford it has resorted to name calling.", "OP- did something change this year that they suddenly can\u2019t afford the annual family vacation? I\u2019m confused as to why the audacity and entitlement started now", "You ruined my vacation because you didn't pay for it? Utter nonsense. NTA. By that dumbass logic isn't he a shit brother for not paying for your vacation?", "NTA", "NTA. You can't give what you don't have... it's as simple as that.\n\nIt's just a sad fact of reality that we sometimes just can't afford to go on vacation. Yeah, I get the FOMO and it can feel sucky, but it's reality nonetheless. If they can't afford to pay for themselves, no one else is obligated to do so for them (especially when it would mean financial risk). They simply have to miss this trip.\n\nYour brother is acting extremely entitled and throwing a tantrum because mommy wouldn't let him have a cookie (when the cookie jar was empty to begin with).", "!updateme", "Why would he think you would pay for his trip?\n\nNTA but genuinely curious.", "NTA - and he shouldn't have agreed if he can't pay...He needs to have a conversation with his parents, not his sibling.", ">Your brother sounds pretty damned entitled to expect someone else to foot the bill for his, his wife's, and his kid's trip to go see Mickey.\n\nIt\u2019s even worse that he said nothing about not being able to afford the trip until after his mother made the arrangements and paid the deposits, if not the total cost. That suggests that the plan was always to badger the OP and/or Mom to cover him.", "Your brother is a major AH for trying to force you into a position of paying his portion.  Yes, he left things to the last minute on purpose.", "yeah, my friends and I are planning on going for a week- friend's daughter's first disney trip- and we're expecting total costs of the trip to be something in the $5k-$10k/per person realm.\n\nwhich is crazy but b/t flights, tickets, hotel on property, and food for a week? it adds up quick.", "Was about to write similar. If this is new behaviour, could they're more at play money wise than just this trip? Is he being rude because he's entitled or is he lashing out because he's in a hole. Not excusing his attitude, but could be more too it. Yearly family traditions like vacations can put a lot of pressure on people.", "Was about to write similar.
