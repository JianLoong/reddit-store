Liam said he wanted to rent a soccer court for his party. However, my dad said that unfortunately it\u2019s really expensive, so he won\u2019t be able to afford it.\n\nLiam became really quiet and sad, sitting there on the table looking down.\n\nSM freaked out, calling my dad an AH, saying it isn\u2019t fair and my dad is always playing favorites, because I\u2019m going on another international trip, which is even more expensive and Dad didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with that, but when it came down to Liam\u2019s bday party, he wouldn\u2019t spent money on it.\n\nShe also said that I\u2019ve always had the things I wanted, while Liam and Noah didn\u2019t, and me and Dad are AHs for letting my brothers feel like they were less.\n\nHowever, Dad isn\u2019t paying a dime and I\u2019ve never even wanted or tried to \u201cshow off\u201d or anything like that. In fact, I think the only thing she could say that I have, and they don\u2019t are my 4 trips to the US.\n\nIn my country, on a girl\u2019s 15th bday, she can choose between a huge party or travelling abroad, usually to Disney. This was the 1st time I went to the US and my dad paid part of it, but the other 3 \u2013 one of them being the upcoming one \u2013, my mom and stepdad paid for everything. If my dad gave me any money for the other 2 past trips, it was like US$30 \u2013 currently US$1 is equivalent to $5 in my country, so it\u2019s kinda expensive \u2013 and I never asked for anything, since it was a plan made with my mom\u2019s side of the family and there was absolutely no reason for him to pay for that.\n\nSo, bro, that pissed me off. I told SM to stfu, because me, mom & SD are the ones paying for my whole trip, my dad hasn\u2019t given me any money for my upcoming trip and it\u2019s not my problem if my mom and SD were always really organized when it came to money, so they were able to provide me some of the things I wanted.\n\nI told her that my dad does everything he can for my brothers, with so much love and he wouldn\u2019t deny Liam that if he could afford it, so, the only reason why my brother won\u2019t have his bday party is because she\u2019s a useless shit who refuses to work, is always spending my dad\u2019s money on cigarettes and alcohol and if she\u2019d act like a grownup, got a job and stopped wasting my dad\u2019s money, she could help him pay for the soccer court and Liam would have his party as he wanted.\n\nSo, AITA for pointing out SM\u2019s bullshit and telling her to grow the f up?\n\nEdit: she started dating my dad when I was 5/6yo. My dad is one of the sweetest people I know, he's always showing people how much he loves and cares about them. SM never valued it, she's extremely rude to him all the time and treats him poorly in front of me, my brothers, her family, their friends, etc. This saddens me so much, because he don't deserve this kind of treatment. \nAnd I guess that Liam, by seeing his mother doing this, thinks it is ok to act like her and disrespect my dad.\n\nEdit 2: as I got older, I started to realize that she might pull this crap, trying to paint my dad and I as the villains and all, because of the \u201crelationship\u201d my dad, my mom and I have, because even though they\u2019ve been divorced for 21 years, they still treat each other respectfully, they have absolutely no problem to meet at events like my birthday, HS graduation, my college graduation, etc. \nMy mom always tells me that although they\u2019re not married anymore, they\u2019ll always be friends, because they had a daughter together, so it\u2019ll always exist the sentiment of love and gratitude for what they lived together. \nSo, I think she gets furious and hates how mature, peaceful and loving my family is.", "created_utc": 1700137094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wli7j/aita_for_telling_my_stepmother_that_it_is_not_my/", "score": 1394, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think she just assumed he was paying for this trip because he gave $30 USD to past ones and paid for the childhood one", "She made it your business when she went spreading lies about you and your dad. Wtf!?! \ud83d\ude02", "I live in America so this may not be something that can be done but are there any parks or anything with nets that you could rent or go to for cheaper? Get some good snacks and hang out there for his birthday. Maybe a new soccer ball as a present? It's cheaper and he may be happy with that, especially if his dad watched a soccer game with him when they got home if one is on. If it's not possible a soccer themed party at home might work.", "Yeah, the more info you give, the more inclined I am to say she is biting her own elbows in jealousy, especially since your mother seem to be financially well and secure of herself, and you aren't begging for her approval. My father's mistress couldn't handle any woman in my dad's life not being her, great idea, date a dude that has three daughters and two nieces glued to him. Thankfully she snapped and left, and my dad now is happily married to a wonderful lady that has a daughter of her own, so no drama. \n\nI'm not better, but thank you so much \ud83e\udd7a", "No, I get it, she was badmouthing your dad. But if I put myself in your brothers' shoes, that would not have been well received, however true.\n\nDefending dad? Yes! Of course! NTA. Calling his wife those things in front of the kids? I probably would have waited to do so.\n\nDoes she usually make comments like this? Because the things you said kinda seem like you've been bottleing up stuff.", "I totally get where you are coming from and that you have to defend your father from her lies. I am just imagining a 8 years old and a 13 years old listening first their mother telling awful lies about their father and then their sister telling true but upsetting things about their mother and I just feel very sorry for them that they are in the middle of this.\n\nI also feel sorry for you and for your father. I didn't say you are T A, I don't think you are.", "she called me a bitch and told me to mind my own business (as if she wasn\u2019t not only lying, but also overstepping \ud83d\ude43)", "Glad to know that you and your dad are finally free of that jararaca \ud83d\ude02\nAnd I\u2019m really sorry to hear it \ud83d\ude14 wish you all the best", "Aw, thanks!", "She made it your business when she included you in her lecture to your father.", "Your stepmom is not ok. Good on you though.", "Thank you for being mature enough to love your brothers and know that they didn't choose their mom. You are clearly a wondeful daughter raised by wonderful parents. Enjoy your trip!", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that! I\u2019m sure that whatever does happen, he\u2019ll have a great birthday because he\u2019s well loved.", "aw, that was so sweet \ud83e\udd79 thank you!", "NTA, I love that you have the spine to stand up to her. If only your dad would learn from you.", "NTA", "INFO: Obviously divorce is an option your dad knows of. Why is he staying with this woman?", "Nta\n\nYour mom sounds lovely.  Your Dad may be sweet but he needs something better than a licorice spine.", "NTA. If you like money, work. however, I will say that maybe you should not have let the feelings get so heated. Though I do not know how you are suppose to say that politely but.", "Could just point to a mirror...", "oh boy, I can\u2019t even describe how much I wanted to have the answer for it. but I like to think that my brothers are the reason for it. SM is clearly unstable and so is her family, then it would be kinda risky for him to not be around all the time.", "I don't know what her end goal is. Are you and your parents supposed to pay for a trip for them? Are you not supposed to be allowed to go as punishment? \n\nOther than guilt and abuse, she wouldn't get anything out of it either way. She made her bed and she can either lie in it or get off her ass and earn some money. NTA", "\u201cWork\u201d.  But also go to work lady!", "Hahaha eu tamb\u00e9m desconfiei que era brasileira pela cota\u00e7\u00e3o do d\u00f3lar kkkkkkkk", "You need to talk to your dad and tell him that divorcing your SM would give your brothers a better life than sticking with the leach. NTA", "I'm having flashbacks of WoW"]}
