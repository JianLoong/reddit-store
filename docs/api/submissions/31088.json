However, my dad said that unfortunately it\u2019s really expensive, so he won\u2019t be able to afford it.\r  \nLiam became really quiet and sad, sitting there on the table looking down. \r  \nSM freaked out, calling my dad an AH, saying it isn\u2019t fair and my dad is always playing favorites, because I\u2019m going on another international trip, which is even more expensive and Dad didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with that, but when it came down to Liam\u2019s bday party, he wouldn\u2019t spent money on it.\r  \nShe also said that I\u2019ve always had the things I wanted, while Liam and Noah didn\u2019t, and me and Dad are AHs for letting my brothers feel like they were less. \r  \nHowever, Dad isn\u2019t paying a dime and I\u2019ve never even wanted or tried to \u201cshow off\u201d or anything like that.
