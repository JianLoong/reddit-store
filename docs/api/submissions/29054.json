He was over me, I was over him and  we didn\u2019t want to get back together (this is important because I didn\u2019t join the hobby in hopes of seeing him, quite the opposite I was sure he\u2019d never attend).\n\nThe thing is, we recently (edit: I said recently because it feels recently, in reality it was like 3 years ago) moved to a new town and he made friends quickly but I knew absolutely no one and since I work from home and all my hobbies are home based, I decided to pick up new things to do and meet new people that way.\n\nMy ex have always talked about learning how to fight with a sword, he\u2019s tried it a few times and have been obsessed. Never did anything about that though, not attended classes or anything. I\u2019ve tried it with him and I absolutely loved it as well. \n\nAfter break up, when I was researching hobby groups in my town, I stumbled across sword fighting and dagger throwing. I signed up for both knowing that my ex would not be there (he never bothered) so it was safe to go and do what I enjoy without feeling like I\u2019m stealing his hobby.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing it for months now and made new friends, improved a lot and basically fell in love with it as well as medieval re-enactments, etc. \n\nWell, last night, my ex attended the session. He suddenly decided to do it and he got angry with me for being there. He said I was the asshole for stealing \u201chis hobby\u201d.\nI told him I don\u2019t care if he is there, we welcome all newbies and he got really annoyed but said nothing more.\n\nHe stayed for the session but later messaged me saying that I ruined it for him and asked me to quit. I said that he ruined it for himself and I wasn\u2019t going to quit because I enjoy it and the on my reason I never joined earlier is because he didn\u2019t want us to have the same hobbies and since he talked about it so much, I let him have it but he never did anything with it.\nHe called me an asshole.\n\nHe told our mutual friend about this and he messaged me telling me I was the asshole and I had to get over my ex and quit it. \n\nI don\u2019t know anymore. AITA? I joined because it was something I wanted to do and I knew my ex wouldn\u2019t be doing it. It was something that would allow me to meet people with similar interest. But I dunno anymore.

You have at least somewhat similar interests or things that tied you together. Sure, the deeper connection and trust ended up not being there or enough to stay together, but you don't have to change who you are just because you're not together.   \n\n\nI used to date a cellist. It would be insane of me to be angry at her for not quitting cello if I showed up at an orchestra rehearsal that she was at. Or the girl I dated who was into Anime. It would be insane of me to be angry to find out she was at a comicon or something. I introduced my wife to choral music. She's been taking voice lessons and singing for like 10 years now. I would be absolutely bat shit to think she stole my hobby if we ended up not together for any reason.   \n\n\nYall are not connected anymore.

I haven\u2019t talked to him in months. \n\nFor the 10+ years I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s always talked about sword fighting but never did anything about it.

Maybe he should stop being so obsessed and get his own group", "NTA. Who the fuck calls dibs on a hobby?", "NTA, you can't steal a hobby.", "NTA. You joined the group first.

I say keep going, you've made friends and moved on. Sounds like he hasn't and you \"ruining it\" for him is proof of that. If he's still interested in the hobby then he can deal with it. Cool hobby btw", "I don't think your ex understands what stealing means. Generally speaking, if you still have something after someone else has taken it, it's not stealing.\n\nThe nerve of this guy to walk into a space you've been in for months and claiming you took it from him. I can see why it didn't last.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t own the activity and you were there first. He can either get over that or he can wallow. Up to him.

It\u2019s a free country, do whatever makes you happy. He sounds like a baby, glad you\u2019ve moved on and are doing better for yourself.

When I read the title I assumed it would be op joining the same hobby group the ex was already a part of, which wouldn't inherently be wrong but I guess I could see how it might feel like stepping on toes or whatever, depending on the specifics of the situation.
