{"id": 34408, "submission_id": "18zgaof", "title": "AITA for heavily limiting my step daughters shower usage?", "selftext": "My husband and I got married 3 years ago and now have a 2 month old daughter. We were best friends for 6 years prior to this. He has a 12yo daughter with his ex and she's honestly great. I love everything about that girl, outside of her shower usage.\n\nSo.. she showers twice a day. Once before school and once around 5pm. She stays in there for 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes every single time. Our hot water is electric and her shower usage has raised our bill to nearly $600 a month for the past 4 months. Whenever I talk to her dad about it, I'm met with a \"it's something we have to get used to because I'm not going to tell her she can't shower\". She uses all the hot water, and considers she showers around dinner time and the kitchen sink affects the temperature of the shower, she's constantly screaming out of the bathroom to turn off the kitchen sink when I'm literally trying to cook and need the water to do so. I've told her several times to not use the shower during the hours of 4p-6p so I can cook/do dishes but she always claims to \"forget\" or gets extremely pissed off and causes a bunch of tension in the house because she \"feels gross\" and needs a shower right that minute. I'm starting to grow resentful because there have been several times I have attempted to bathe our daughter/bathe myself or do the dishes and there's been no hot water. My husband also takes two showers a day. Once before work and once immediately following work. He comes home at 6. He also complains because when he gets home there's no hot water but he never says anything to his daughter.\n\nBut recently they cut my husband's hours down to half the time he usually had because the company is threatening to go under so the financial responsibilities have been 80% on my shoulders (I own my own business). It used to be 50/50. I told him that since I'm now paying significantly more than he is, I refuse to pay this much for electric and him and his daughter both will be limited to one shower a day, for no more than a half hour. I told his daughter this as well. Both are calling me controlling and have disregarded everything I said and still shower twice a day for 45+ minutes. So I left and told them to figure out how to pay for everything. I'm currently staying at my mom's with the baby. He says I'm an AH because I just left them in a trying time all because I want to \"control\" their showering. That's not it at all. They are financially ruining me and I'm not putting up with it anymore. I literally have maybe $200 a month after I pay all the bills and a baby that needs diapers. This is gross but I've literally only been able to shower twice without the baby since I had her because of them. I either bathe her or bathe myself thoroughly and I need to bathe the baby because she's super chunky and gets stuff trapped in the rolls and gets rashes.\n\nETA: this wasn't a normal until recently. Step daughter moved in with us in September for school because her mom moved out of district and she wanted to stay in the same school. So this is all new to me. My husband always showered twice a day but the bill was still significantly less because his showers usually don't exceed 20 minutes.

This is **learned behavior**.\n\nSounds like it's time to install [a shower timer](https://showersavingtimer.com/).", "NTA\n\nHonestly I take two showers a day in the summer, but these showers generally run about 10 minutes.  Sometimes 15 minutes. IDK what the weather is like where you are but there is no justification for showering 45 minutes twice a day.  Both of them? This is a learned behavior but what are they doing in the shower that long? If they are relaxing in the shower, then perhaps they can shift to a short early shower and a relaxing bath when they get home. This isn't fair to you at all. I'm sorry OP", "NTA YIKES. You can shower twice a day of each shower is a normal length like 5-10minutes. I get needing to shower again after work or after sport\u2019s practice or something or on a hot sweaty day. But the lengths they shower are nuts! You\u2019re completely right to leave them to their excessive water bills.", "NTA. Your husband takes 2 showers a day. Of course his daughter thinks it's normal.  But you have been dealing with this for over 3 years and it is NOT going to change. Which is fine if he's paying that bill. But now he's forcing you to pay for their bad habits. \n\nI don't blame you for moving out. Now he has a much greater incentive to find a new job. And I would NOT move back in until he agrees to always pay for the electric bill AND install an on demand water heater so you and your baby always have hot water.", "Go to your water heater.   There will be a valve you can close.  It will cut-off the hot water supply.    It doesn't take more then 10 minutes to clean oneself.", "NTA\n\nEnergy is not cheap, and they obviously don't care.\n\nYou have done the right thing. I hope you have stopped paying the bills for the house as well. Let him find out just how expensive electricity is especially when they are the ones wasting it.", "NTA\nYou are not asking to take away her ability to be clean, you are asking for her to be considerate to the family situation and everyone\u2019s needs. If the dad or her mom was footing all the utilities I would say, not your business but that is not the case.", "NTA because obviously you are right to limit this but I wonder if she has some mental health issues that have been unaddressed. If she's an athlete I can see two quick showers a day, but 45 minutes is a LONG time and \"feeling gross\" sounds suspiciously like a mental health concern to me. I say NTA instead of NAH because I think your husband's kind of the asshole here. He needs to pay more attention to his daughter. He needs to be more concerned and no so checked-out.", "NTA - her water usage is WAY EXCESSIVE. Two showers a day is excessive. Anything more than 10 minutes is excessive.", "NTA. Him and his daughter are creating this \u201ctrying time\u201d he\u2019s claiming you left him in. They could EASILY fix this problem. **They are actively choosing not to fix the problem and instead are expecting you to pay out the ass for their wants.** Stay where you are until you can get your own place.", "NTA. Replace the water heater with a mobile home sized one. It will reheat much faster and keep showers short.", "NTA. There is NO need for showers to last that long. Two showers a day is questionable but under certain circumstances (such as they sweat profusely at night) I can understand it, just not for 45 minutes or more.", "NTA.  Two quick showers (<15 minutes) is fine but what you describe is excessive.  Also, why isn\u2019t her mother paying child support to defray costs?", "NTA. I do think you\u2019re having a big reaction, probably brought on by the stress of the baby and household expenses.\n\nGet a shower timer as a short-term solution, but you really need to talk to your husband. He showers twice daily too, and so is most likely the source of this learned behavior in his child. No one needs two showers in the course of a normal day, and he needs to get the root cause of why he and his daughter to this. It\u2019s an inconsiderate and expensive habit, but from the way your daughter claims to feel \u201cgross\u201d I think there\u2019s some compulsion or psychological thing going on here. The kid is going through puberty: has someone traded her about smelling bad? Does your husband need a stronger deodorant to feel clean? If you have a local Planet Fitness for a very small monthly fee they can shower there as long as they like, if there\u2019s simply no giving it up. There\u2019s an answer somewhere.\n\nBut the shower thing isn\u2019t the core issue: it\u2019s that you feel disrespected and desperate and are unable to do things you need to do. I feel for the child, but she needs to listen when you say no showering between 4-6pm. That\u2019s in no way an unreasonable request. And no one on earth is so filthy they need to be in the shower for those lengths of time.\n\nEveryone in the family is stressed. A cool off period should help, and then counseling if at all possible. I know that can be expensive, but insurance may cover it.", "Is this a clean thing where she is spending the entire time actively washing herself or is she messing around in there? That much time spent scrubbing seems like it would be harsh on the skin/scalp/hair. If she wants to relax, can she take a bath instead? Not to be graphic/TMI, but is there any chance that she is entering puberty and may have discovered things to do in the shower, especially if you have a handheld showerhead?", "NTA - when the length of showers affects the whole household, you have to be considerate of those effects. This is nothing new, it's a long-standing basic household understanding. They can either shower once a day for 30min or twice a day for 15 each, or some other equivalent (20 for the shaving, hair washing shower, 10 for a quick rinse off, etc.) Or they can come up with some other appropriate compromise, but no, it's absurd to expect it to continue as is!", "Okay as a mom whose had teens I\u2019m going to point out the not so obvious. She\u2019s masturbating in the shower. Put a lock on her bedroom door so she has privacy elsewhere. I bet the bills go down. If that\u2019s not the issue, she might have ocd but you\u2019d probably pick up other hints of that in her behavior. It\u2019s most likely puberty hormones.", "The water waste on a dying planet is ridiculous. I am normally not a fan of leaving the house in protest but short of a shower timer, I have no idea how to get through to them. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  It almost sounds like the husband and daughter have cleanliness / germ issues.  5-10 minutes is plenty long to clean every nook and cranny, and one shower a day is typically enough unless someone gets extra dirty or has strong BO.\n\nTell them both that you will limit them to one shower a day, and that after 10 minutes in the first shower, you will turn off the hot water heater.", "Nta. I also took very very long showers when I was that age. Ran it until the water got cold. I really liked the handheld shower massager. \n\nI've read thru dozens of responses here and no one sees this. If she were a boy, everyone would be all over the answer.\n\nEdit, scrolled a bit more and found a couple. Just surprised they're not at the top.", "Turn off the power breaker for the water heater, most are about 50 gallons of hot water won't last long 15 -20 minutes !", "NTA but I think you need to have a conversation about her mental health. It could be depression, but I really hate to say it\u2026 it could also be some kind of SA trauma. I remember after my SA I would take really long and ridiculously hot showers because I felt unclean and I (in twisted trauma logic) wanted to try and burn away the skin he touched. Combined with the wild mood swings and it could be possible something *might* be happening. Not saying for sure and I\u2019m not trying to terrify you, I\u2019m just recognizing some of my old behaviors in hers. Like I said it could also be some kind of depression because people with depression tend to take long hot showers to try and replace something they don\u2019t know how to.", "I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with showering twice per day but the time is excessive. An hour a half every day to shower is crazy. I would try to compromise. I think allowing the two showers a day is warranted but tell her she really needs to be more considerate of how long she spends in the shower. Your husband needs to have this conversation with her too so you\u2019re both on the same page.", "Disclaimer I have biases due to being from a country that grew up with water restrictions.\n\nNTA what the hell. What kind of person wastes that much water? INSANITY. It was litterally law here to have 3 minute showers. Get in clean everything and bloody well get OUT.\n\nCudos to you for doing the mature thing and not weaponising the kitchen sink.\n\nCut those to 5 mins and if the kid doesn't like it then tough. Don't waste water.", "OP, it is so relevant that they have OCD. That should really be in the post. Is this child being treated for her OCD? Because this situation went from \"kid being selfish\" to \"kid with a serious mental health problem who may need more support\"", " NTA but they need to figure out they feel the need to shower twice a day. Do they sweat more (medical condition?) Do they just feel dirty? Sounds like a physical and/or a mental health issue. Time to get to the root cause of why they do this. Once they figure it out then it will be no big deal to limit showers to once a day.", "NTA, and agree with all the comments on the cost not being fair, but I also want to highlight - u getting screamed at for using water while cooking and cleaning for the family after working all day, and not having time, an available bathroom, or available hot water for a shower for yourself. These are serious factors here too and are beyond not ok. I am sorry OP and hope they learn their lesson .", ">She stays in there for 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes every single time.\n\nAm I the only one concerned that she is running the water for a different reason? Covering up the sound of puking? Easy clean up for self injury? I'd be concerned about the health of a child as well as the water bill.", "I wouldn\u2019t call you the asshole, because what your asking is perfectly reasonable. \n\nI\u2019m like your daughter and husband. I shower before work and when I get home, not usually right away. Typically after I make dinner. \nI\u2019ve always been like this but my reasoning isn\u2019t really I\u2019m dirty after work - I used to have jobs like this but now I have a desk job. My reasoning is all sensory.\nI have a few learning disabilities and some are linked to other senses, so things like certain fabrics I can\u2019t handle.\nI shower in the morning then work in a cool office but I generally feel disgusting when I get home. And need to shower before I change. I know I\u2019m not dirty, but I \u201cfeel\u201d dirty.\n\nI used to wash my hair both showers, recently I have gotten better about not washing my hair on the second shower because I started colouring it and I was washing the dye out so fast I couldn\u2019t keep up with it. But if I\u2019m having an emotional day, I fidget and touch my hair, and convince myself my scalp is coated in oil. But I know it\u2019s not. But I can\u2019t get over it unless I shower.\n\nSometimes since I shower in the evening, on weekends when I sleep in I can push it to 1 shower a day by showering late morning early afternoon. Typically when I would be mid my day during a work day. And I can be comfortable until bed time. So it\u2019s more of a every X number of hours my brain thinks I\u2019m dirty. Not really twice a day.\n\nThe difference is I don\u2019t spend that much time in the shower. My morning bathroom routine including using the bathroom, brushing teeth, showering, and drying off takes me maybe 15 minutes. My evening shower takes me maybe 5 minutes. Water turns on, I wash myself with a loofa, rinse off and get out. \n\nI think it\u2019s unfair to say only one shower a day - because maybe she has something like a sensory issue going on. Would it be more reasonable to instead limit her total water usage for the day? EX she can have the shower running for a total of 30 minutes per day, but that can be split up into two showers if she wants. Of 15 minutes each.\nIf she shaves her legs in the shower, maybe it\u2019s worth getting a cheap electric razor. I found doing this instead of shaving in the shower was the biggest time saver. \n\nYour definitely in the right to be upset because she\u2019s being inconsiderate of other people, but she probabaly has no concept yet of just how expensive that is, so it might be hard for her to comprehend the whole situation and if she has gotten away with it it\u2019s going to be hard to change. I would give her the option of just shorter showers and see what happens.", "NtA.  Dear $diety. What on earth has caused this girl to hate herself so much that she feels she has to shower 90 minutes a day to feel clean?  She needs a psych evaluation asap.  Do NOT destroy your mental and financial health for them", "NTA, they both clearly need help with their OCD because whatever methods they\u2019re using now aren\u2019t working well, and in the meantime make use of a shower timer. \n\n10 minutes is enough time to thoroughly clean, anything more than that is a waste of water and energy. If they want to argue - tell them that because of them you haven\u2019t had even a 5 minute shower in however long it\u2019s been, let alone a 45 minute one.", "Yeah that money should probably be going to therapy.", "NTA\nYou had talks with them and they couldn't just take a shower for 15 minutes?

Showering twice a day for ten minutes is fine. But for 45 minutes? How are they not chapped as all hell? \n\nYour step daughter can move schools and go back to living with her mom if she\u2019s gonna act like that. \n\nAnd dad better find another source of income pronto. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but these two don\u2019t deserve to have all their creature comforts as your expense when you literally haven\u2019t had any alone time to yourself in two months if you can\u2019t even shower.", "NTA. The only time I ever showered 2-3x (before school, after school and sometimes before bed) a day was when I lived in the middle east and was routinely playing sports outside in the dust and 90f heat, and those showers used to be 5-10mins. \n\nThis is excessive, and if you can't afford it, you can't afford it. They both need treatment for their OCD if it is causing this much of a problem. A bath would be better if she wants to spend that long in hot water because it would use less water.", "NTA, because you're overwhelmed and can't be the enforcer to these clueless people. The short answer is, shut off the hot water after 15 minutes. Be the smart person here, and negotiate with the 12 year-old.  \"Here, sweetheart, let's set a timer for 15 minutes, and we promise not to use the kitchen sink in that time. Twenty minutes if you take just one shower per day\".  For your husband, haven't you shown him the bills? Can you and he not have a reasonable discussion? You need someone to take care of the baby while you shower. Your husband's shower time may not exceed your shower time. He cares for the baby while you shower. You see what I'm suggesting, here? It's only fair. You need genuine help. Best of luck. I'm so sorry.", "NTA. If he lost his job or had his hours cut and the budget has been significantly impacted, changes may need to happen and everyone should be willing to compromise. Such as cutting out unnecessary expenses like two people showering twice a day for extended periods. A quick second shower under specific circumstances is much different than multiple hour-long showers. \n\nAs the person who is now shouldering the bills, it\u2019s not unreasonable for you to look for places to cut back. The problem here is that neither of them care.", "NTA.  You have a husband problem.  He is trying to do anything to keep the daughter happy and doesn't seem to care that you are not able to live your life.  The fact that he thinks it is about controlling showering shows he is not paying any attention to anything but the daughter. \n\nStay with your mom, let him take care of the bills in his name, pay the ones in your name, and tell him you are willing to talk anytime he is ready to be an adult.", "NTA, but if you're the stepmother of a teenage girl, and the only one doing the enforcing, there is almost no way you are coming out of this unscathed.

I get legit grubby, covered in dirt, by doing landscaping or other projects, and yet can get myself squeaky clean in less than 5 minutes.  When you read about how limited clean water is for much of the planet, the idea of anyone regularly taking 45 minute or longer showers really offends me.  \n\nThen, you get to the cost of the electricity to warm the water, and the lack of availability to others in the household, and the entitlement of the father and daughter is mind boggling.\n\nNTA.   And I do not for one instant believe that they have OCD that only comes out in a need for multiple long showers.  That's not how it works.", "NTA.\n\nRather than limiting the number of showers per day, it would be better to limit the time spent showering. 45-75 minutes is very excessive. I'm male with short hair so I understand a female with long hair and who might shave is going to take longer than the 5-10 minutes it takes me, but 20 minutes seems like it should be plenty, less for the 2nd shower unless she is washing her hair and shaving both showers which seems excessive and is likely to damage her hair.", "YTA for not mentioning they have OCD lol, come on.", "Are they ok?

We were best friends for 6 years prior to this. He has a 12yo daughter with his ex and she's honestly great. I love everything about that girl, outside of her shower usage. \n\nSo.. she showers twice a day. Once before school and once around 5pm. She stays in there for 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes every single time. Our hot water is electric and her shower usage has raised our bill to nearly $600 a month for the past 4 months. Whenever I talk to her dad about it, I'm met with a \"it's something we have to get used to because I'm not going to tell her she can't shower\". She uses all the hot water, and considers she showers around dinner time and the kitchen sink affects the temperature of the shower, she's constantly screaming out of the bathroom to turn off the kitchen sink when I'm literally trying to cook and need the water to do so. I've told her several times to not use the shower during the hours of 4p-6p so I can cook/do dishes but she always claims to \"forget\" or gets extremely pissed off and causes a bunch of tension in the house because she \"feels gross\" and needs a shower right that minute. I'm starting to grow resentful because there have been several times I have attempted to bathe our daughter/bathe myself or do the dishes and there's been no hot water. My husband also takes two showers a day. Once before work and once immediately following work. He comes home at 6. He also complains because when he gets home there's no hot water but he never says anything to his daughter. \n\nBut recently they cut my husband's hours down to half the time he usually had because the company is threatening to go under so the financial responsibilities have been 80% on my shoulders (I own my own business). It used to be 50/50. I told him that since I'm now paying significantly more than he is, I refuse to pay this much for electric and him and his daughter both will be limited to one shower a day, for no more than a half hour. I told his daughter this as well. Both are calling me controlling and have disregarded everything I said and still shower twice a day for 45+ minutes. So I left and told them to figure out how to pay for everything. I'm currently staying at my mom's with the baby. He says I'm an AH because I just left them in a trying time all because I want to \"control\" their showering. That's not it at all. They are financially ruining me and I'm not putting up with it anymore. I literally have maybe $200 a month after I pay all the bills and a baby that needs diapers.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Time for husband and step-daughter to get gym memberships and shower there. \n\n\nHave you shown your step-daughter your paycheck and the electric bill side by side? Tell her that it\u2019s not sustainable. There is no money for this kind of habit. There is no extra money lying around to fund these showers. There is never going to be any money to help her with a car, college, etc. \n\n\nThe family is hoping nothing bad happens health wise, car wise, and property wise. If a tree needed to be cut today to stop it from falling on your house, there is no money. If she breaks her arm tomorrow, there is no money. Everyone is going to have to do without things to get this family in a better spot. You\u2019re not being controlling. You are being realistic. There is no money and the family can\u2019t keep going on like there is. \n\n\nIf you truly can\u2019t afford things, then it\u2019s time to go to a food bank with her and your husband. They need a wake up call that your family is on the brink of the poverty domino effect. Once the snowball starts with getting behind on bills, it\u2019s hard to come back from if finances aren\u2019t changed. \n\n\nBesides the wake up call and getting food assistance: She can take the bus to and from school if she isn\u2019t already, husband gets a second job, and all the frills are cut out. If you have pets, it might be necessary to rehome them. This is another wake up call, there isn\u2019t money for kitty litter or a bag of dog food lying around. \n\n\nAnother wake up call, it\u2019s time for husband and step-daughter to start couponing and researching frugal meals. There is no eating out, ordering in, or getting Starbucks. \n\n\nIf she buys full price meals at school, she\u2019s now getting basic frugal lunch food from home. If she\u2019s on free and reduced lunch, stick with that. No more desserts or empty carb snacks. No sodas. No candy. Everyone is drinking water except the baby. \n\n\nOn practical side, see if you can cut streaming services or get reduction on car insurance/home insurance. Shop around for quotes. Shop around for better phone services rates/plans. Thermostat can be adjusted to use less energy. Washer can be set on maybe a different setting. Hopefully, baby/toddler clothes can be donated to your family. \n\n\nYou can also further drive the point home by having a garage sale, selling things online, etc. If the husband and step-daughter think they can just keep going on as is with no cares in the world,  then they are about to be uncomfortable elsewhere. They\u2019ll have to face how they can keep being selfish in this one area- but they\u2019ll no longer have a clean conscience about how far they are pushing their family to literally breaking apart or to financial ruin.\n\n\nYou\u2019re not controlling.

I thought it might be more helpful to use an urgent problem to help her face that she has to curtail her urgent compulsion. But of course, she needs a lot of help to do this, and the husband needs to be the leader here and model behavior. I think it would help for OP to focus her efforts on getting through to her husband, because until he recognizes that this is a real problem and that both he and his daughter need more help with their disorders, it's going to be impossible for OP to get through to a child and convince her to sit in panic-inducing revulsion and misery and to feel dirty and wrong and creepy crawly and impure and contaminated.

It's also like, because they can get new fears/compulsions at any time, they worry that if they add more cleaning tasks to their life, they'll get freaked out over those too and lose control over even more things.\n\nFor others it's less about not cleaning and more about being disorganized, because of ADHD like your brother (I also have ADHD), or because their personality is actually not type A/meticulous/perfectionistic, so unless they have a compulsion about something in particular, they really don't care about being neat or clean.\n\nSo I definitely get what you mean!
