Communication is a huge parenting fail. The moment my mom realized the bedroom situation wasn't going to work when she got pregnant, she immediately told me the plan. The baby got the back room (annoying for her lol), but the moment I went to college the back room was mine and if always have a room at her place but since I wouldn't be around, he would need more space. Made complete sense to me. Boom, no problem, I had ample time to process it, and was super supportive of it. Helped moved shit around too! We were both getting something, I was going to college and he got a big boy room!  This is not what happened to you. . She blindsided you and then didn't give you the courtesy of a room. That's on top of whatever happened before. So, I'd nope out hard. And probably not visit for Christmas. Boundaries with your mom are going to be huge.... Good luck!", "NTA. No one I know with a kid in college would dump them on a sofa over their xmas break. The dorms all close and most students don't have anywhere else to stay.

You are not living there anymore. You cannot expect them to fully keep it the way it was. They offered you a guestroom.

I expect you would feel not so resentful if they had explained this to you ahead of time, and asked what you would like to have happen to your things, rather than just transferring everything to a storage unit.", "NTA", "NTA.

I'm surprised they bothered to store your stuff rather than just dumping it.", "NTA, and all the Y-T-A votes are absolutely baffling to me. And it has nothing to do with actually giving up the room to the seven year old, because that makes sense and is completely justified. It's about the complete lack of common courtesy and respect to OP, to at minimum let her know that they will be giving the seven year old her room. And would therefor be going into her room and going through all of her possessions and packing everything up to go to storage. Had OP been informed, they could have (1) possibly tried to arrange a quick trip home, to help sort and pack her possessions. (2) informed them of any valuable and fragile possessions that she would want them to be very careful with, as to not risk possibly breaking anything. (3) possibly have them ship any possessions that OP would prefer to have with her at college, rather than be put in a storage unit.\n\nAnd then we move on to the second issue, the guest room. They said OP could use the guest room, and didn\u2019t tell her that they had actually given up the room to her grandparents, so OP would now be forced to (1) sleep on a couch and (2) sleep in the living room, where they would have absolutely no privacy the whole trip. OP\u2019s mom definitely knew her parents would be coming (and using the guest room) well before OP landed. If you\u2019re going to be giving away the room that you promised someone can stay in, the bare minimum that you owe that person is to let them know of the change of plans as soon as you can. And let that person make their decision if they still want to come or not.\n\nSo OP is NTA. The amount of effort it would have taken to keep the communication open with OP, and keep her informed about home issues that involve her, is very little.
