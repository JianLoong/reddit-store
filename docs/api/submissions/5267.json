Communication is a huge parenting fail. The moment my mom realized the bedroom situation wasn't going to work when she got pregnant, she immediately told me the plan. The baby got the back room (annoying for her lol), but the moment I went to college the back room was mine and if always have a room at her place but since I wouldn't be around, he would need more space. Made complete sense to me. Boom, no problem, I had ample time to process it, and was super supportive of it. Helped moved shit around too! We were both getting something, I was going to college and he got a big boy room!  This is not what happened to you. . She blindsided you and then didn't give you the courtesy of a room. That's on top of whatever happened before. So, I'd nope out hard. And probably not visit for Christmas. Boundaries with your mom are going to be huge.... Good luck!", "NTA. No one I know with a kid in college would dump them on a sofa over their xmas break. The dorms all close and most students don't have anywhere else to stay. I'm glad you could stay with your girlfriend. As you look at housing for next year you might focus on off campus apartments where you have full 12 month access.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents suck.\n\nIt is alright they gave your room to one of their other kids.  You are not living there anymore. You cannot expect them to fully keep it the way it was. They offered you a guestroom. Which is perfectly fine...\n\n\nAnd than they said never mind, we find the other people more important. And this happened last minute, without anything consideration.\n\nThey seem to do everything without considering you", "NTA.\n\nIt makes sense that they need to make room for a new baby, but doing so without even telling you is pretty mean.\n\nBut now there's no room for you *at all*?\n\nThe comfort of babies and grandparents kind of takes precedence over people who are young adults and no longer live at home full time, but this is pretty shitty.  I expect you would feel not so resentful if they had explained this to you ahead of time, and asked what you would like to have happen to your things, rather than just transferring everything to a storage unit.", "NTA", "NTA. Stay with your gf and spend time where you can enjoy yourself and not feel 2nd best. If that's with your gf family then so be it.", "Nta. They probably want a free babysitter.", "NTA.  I'm surprised they bothered to store your stuff rather than just dumping it.", "NTA, and all the Y-T-A votes are absolutely baffling to me. And it has nothing to do with actually giving up the room to the seven year old, because that makes sense and is completely justified. It's about the complete lack of common courtesy and respect to OP, to at minimum let her know that they will be giving the seven year old her room. And would therefor be going into her room and going through all of her possessions and packing everything up to go to storage. Had OP been informed, they could have (1) possibly tried to arrange a quick trip home, to help sort and pack her possessions. (2) informed them of any valuable and fragile possessions that she would want them to be very careful with, as to not risk possibly breaking anything. (3) possibly have them ship any possessions that OP would prefer to have with her at college, rather than be put in a storage unit.\n\nAnd then we move on to the second issue, the guest room. They said OP could use the guest room, and didn\u2019t tell her that they had actually given up the room to her grandparents, so OP would now be forced to (1) sleep on a couch and (2) sleep in the living room, where they would have absolutely no privacy the whole trip. OP\u2019s mom definitely knew her parents would be coming (and using the guest room) well before OP landed. If you\u2019re going to be giving away the room that you promised someone can stay in, the bare minimum that you owe that person is to let them know of the change of plans as soon as you can. And let that person make their decision if they still want to come or not.\n\nSo OP is NTA. The amount of effort it would have taken to keep the communication open with OP, and keep her informed about home issues that involve her, is very little. It\u2019s a couple of courtesy text messages, but OP\u2019s mom can\u2019t even do that for her.", "NTA - if your mum and stepdad are paying for your schooling though I would keep things from boiling over until you\u2019re done college.", "NTA\n\nYou got pushed out of your room, you didn't get told that you'd have to do with the couch in the living room until you landed.   They apparently don't really care about your well being.", "NTA. -  they had a spare room that could have been used as the third bedroom.  Most college kids that I have known still have a bedroom to come home to on holidays and breaks.\nMoving your stuff to storage was really low on their part and a total disregard for your property and feelings. Not sure why you are so upset about the new baby.  Although I\u2019m sure you have scars from your childhood. You might want to check and see if they have AlAnon in close proximity to your school.", "Your never a jerk for having feelings it just depends on what you do with those feelings", "NTA", "NTA. Sounds like Mom still isn't being mom. She probably never will be. Start learning to live your life without her. When you graduate she may very well throw your stored things away. Mine did that. Crazy people do crazy things. \nShe's TA.", "NTA, even though you are at college, that is still your room. Your own room means something to a lot of people and they took that without asking. Whilst they have the right to in their house, it's still an AH move", "I mean I don't see the reason you are angry about a child if she actually is sobered up.  \n\n\nYour stuff getting stored without permission perfectly reasonable to be unhappy about.\n\nYou choosing better sleeping arrangements than the ones offered? NTA about that. They offered you bad arrangements a couch when you have a warm bed and a partner to cuddle with it's pretty obvious which you would choose.", "Very difficult to tell in this situation. Most likely you have several scars from her years as an alcoholic and overly sensitive to the situation. But still this looks like a disrepectful move.", "YTA. You moved out for college. There is a child who needs his own room, so of course it goes to him. It is also their home, their rules, their decision. It probably would have been better to let you know they were packing your stuff for storage. However they are under no obligation to hold your room for you. It would have been nice if they could have given you a bed for your visit.  It again, it is their home.", "NAH but you are a legal adult and did move out.  Your parents do have every right to repurpose your old room since it's their house and your siblings did need it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Get over it. Your parents are adults. Let them deal with it. Practically speaking they won\u2019t be day-to-day important in your life going forward anyway.", "I think the sudden nature of the change is a major concern. Moving someone to an uncomfortable location is fine if you tell them in advance, because if they're not happy with it they could cancel or get a hotel or stay with someone else. Telling them last minute is a power play, specifically designed to make them feel like crap.", "NTA. \n\n>No one I know with a kid in college would dump them on a sofa over their xmas break.\n\nSpecially if they live in a dorm.

It\u2019s not unreasonable for her to expect to have  her bedroom with her belongings in it when she returns home from school.  She has every right to feel blindsided by this. \n\nThey gave her bedroom to her younger sibling without telling her or asking her for permission to pack her personal belongings up and where to put it. Instead, They invaded her privacy by rummaging through and packing up all her stuff and moving it to a storage unit. \n\nThe thing is, they have a \u201cguest bedroom\u201d in the house. So was it really necessary to move her stuff out of her room and into a storage unit? Why not move her into the spare bedroom instead? Or move one of the siblings in the extra bedroom. It sounds more like they don\u2019t want her to be there anymore. They can\u2019t even be bothered with ensuring she has a bedroom to sleep in when she comes home for the holidays. I mean why couldn\u2019t they put the baby in their bedroom for the holidays? Or make the younger kids share a room so she could have her own private bedroom while she\u2019s there.  She\u2019s an adult and she\u2019s getting no respect as one. They are just going out of their way to make her uncomfortable at this point.", "Sure. Just shoulda talked to her about it first and I think that's the bigger hangup is it was just a surprise slap in the face.", "Nowhere does it say he\u2019s jealous of his half brother nor was this the question. Are you projecting here?\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough to conclude his mom is the asshole here: a youth full of neglect, dumping his possessions without a possibility to obtain them beforehand, not leaving a place to stay for him and not warning him about it. Why would you spend the holidays with someone who has so little respect for you? \n\nI really don\u2019t understand how you came the conclusion he\u2019s the asshole\u2026", "I agree with you.  They have a guest room, why did they move her stuff to a storage unit.  It looks like the mother wants a do over with her new family and maybe the older child is a reminder of how awful she was as a mother to her.  She\u2019s certainly not trying to mend bridges.", "She literally says in the first paragraph that she was upset at the news and complained about her mother\u2019s pregnancy to her stepdad. \n\nShe\u2019s jealous.
