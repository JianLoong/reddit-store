My sister came in from New York to spend the weekend with me and brought her kids along. I\u2019m not big on birthdays but I figured I\u2019d do something small and at least spend time with my family. \n\nMy sister arrived Friday night with the intention of spending the weekend. I live on the third floor. Her kids woke up at 6 am, Sat morning, and were running in my small 3 bed apartment. She also has 2 teenagers who left my bathroom messy and out of order. They were also leaving lights on, turning on the heat without notifying me (running up the light and electric bill) I gently pointed these things out to her and told her that we\u2019re on the 3rd floor and out of respect for the neighbors downstairs should try to keep things quiet.\n\nI should point out that I have no kids and enjoy this aspect about my life. I don\u2019t \u201chate kids\u201d and enjoy being around the children in my family, but I do get annoyed when kids are unruly and disrespectful, related or not.\n\nAnyways she packed her things and made it seem like we were all good. Said she was staying at my other sisters house and coming back the following day so that we can celebrate my bday on Sunday. She gave me no indication that she was upset about anything I said or did during her time here.\n\nThe next day I got a measly \u201chbd\u201d text and she was a no show. She did not come to my home and left back to NY from my sisters home. I responded thank you, but then later found out that she was upset that I asked her to control her children while in my home. \n\nMy mother eventually told me why she was a no-show for my actual birthday the following day and I texted her and let her know that moving forward, when she comes in to town, that she should stay at my sisters. She tried to act like she was unaware about what was going on but I couldn\u2019t really give a shit - the damage is done.\n\nAm I in the wrong for asking her to rein in her kids while they\u2019re in my home?\n\nI ended up spending my bday alone with zero family, all because of a misunderstanding. Maybe it was deserved.\n\n**Edit - wow didn\u2019t expect for this to get any views or comments. Thought I should add some more info since some of the comments requested a bit more to make a proper assessment of whether I am an asshole! \ud83d\ude03**\n\n**- the kids are aged 13,14 and 3. The 3 year old is very rambunctious, while 13 and 14 year are always on their phones and leave messes everywhere they go. I could tell whether they were in a room or not after they left the room, depending on the condition of said room. My other sisters 2 yr old was also there**\n\n**- my neighbor just came in from a work trip Friday night and was most likely jet lagged and tired. I wanted to be respectful of that.**\n\n**- I just moved in on the 1st of Nov.**\n\n**- i am broke and on a tight budget**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT 2 / FINAL EDIT*\n\n**i just want to say thank you to everyone who offered their two cents and really tried to play devils advocate without getting their personal feels involved. For the record, I do not hate kids, I just personally decided to not have any because I grew up in a dysfunctional family and did not want to pass that on. I still have a lot to work on and have learned a lot from this post - from child care, to healthy communication tips etc. Although I mostly got NTA votes, I will still be apologizing and reaching out to make sure we are on good terms moving forward. She will always be welcomed, but there are rules to follow in my home just like there are in all of your homes.

Secondly, \"small 3 bedroom apartment\" LOL. Lastly, you are describing the issues of having guests in your space, but it sounds as if they were there for a month and not supposed to be just for a weekend. Leaving lights on, heating on - it is TWO DAYS. So yeah, you were a terrible host and I don't judge your sister for deciding to go stay with your other family instead.

You are also trying to establish a good relationship with your neighbors, so I can see why you'd ask your sister and her children to refrain from making noise.

No issues there. \n\nI do think though, if I was your sister, I would have left for  for the heat/electric comments specifically. While it may not be polite to adjust the thermostat without consulting the host, and I would reprimand my child if I knew they'd done it, if someone told me that my kids were causing their bills to increase after a single day, I'd feel uncomfortable staying there. I have no other issue  with people telling me to reign in my kids if needed, but that particular comment would have made me feel unwelcome (over the lights moreso than the heat).\n\nETA for clarification", "ESH\n\nI think you hit on some of them in your edit but here is why everyone is the AH's. First, yes, the kids should respect your house and follow your rules. It's YOUR house. But, you should also understand that having company over there will be teenagers who leave lights on, leave things out of place, etc. They are teenagers...unfortunately, most of them are self-absorbed little twits. (And I mean that in a loving way because not all teenagers are bad, we were all teenagers once.) Teens today have their noses stuck in a phone and seem to move from one spot to the next, aimlessly wandering about from room to room. I walk behind my two all day turning off lights that they swear they have no idea how they got turned on. Maybe because they TURNED THEM ON WHEN THEY WALKED INTO THE ROOM?!? \n\nAlso, you can't expect a toddler to understand the concept of downstairs and apartment living. I totally support you being thoughtful of the neighbor below you though. I probably would have gone down there and just checked in with them though. Sometimes it's not as loud as what you think if you have a good rug. Also, if your neighbor has a good fan (Vornado makes LOUD fans) he probably couldn't hear anything. \n\nTo a childless person, the little things can seem like big things. And to a parent, we sometimes are miffed at why someone would blow up over something so trivial. This brings us to the breakdown in communication. I get that you said you grew up in a dysfunctional family. I get those types of families. My Mom and her siblings grew up in one. Holy Hell do I have some stories about that side of the family! But, now that their parents have passed, they are learning to communicate with each other. I can't say they have perfected the art 100%, but they are trying. \n\nBTW...your electricity and water bill wasn't going to have gone up THAT much, even if you left the lights on all day for Saturday and Sunday.

I know there's a line of going too far (feet on the table, dirty dishes in the sink etc), but if hosts want their guests to feel at home, they then can't be shocked when their guests make themselves feel at home, which comes at a monetary cost because you go from 1 person to 6.

And we don't know how she spoke to her sister, but given the response was just to pack up and leave without saying anything, and given the text OP sent later, I suspect she was not as calm and polite as she claims. But we don't know that. So hence ESH. Sister for not addressing the behaviour and possibly leaving without an adult discussion. OP for acting as though these behaviors were end of the world and only for 2 days. Could have just dealt with it and not had them back.", "Disagree that everyone sucks here. She didnt yell at them or curse them out. She asked her sister (thier mother)  to address these things. You said could be easily solved by addressing these issues.

You just needed to tell the order ones to tidy up & help look after their younger siblings if their mum didn't. You're their aunt, close family; if mum hasn't said anything, then the kids still need an adult in their lives that actually will set boundaries for them.\n\nAs for the thermostat - you've written elsewhere that you've got it set at 65F / ~18C - that's not a suitable temperature for either teens, toddlers or even many adults. I certainly couldn't stay if someone kept the thermostat so low. You weren't capable of hosting, you really shouldn't have offered to host - I don't think it's entirely your fault that you thought you could or that you didn't understand the needs of the kids as you mentioned you were brought up in a dysfunctional household & are recently used to having 100% control of your environment. But that's not possible when you have guests, of any age, but specially toddlers & teens. \n\nI can't actually decide if this is a NAH or a ESH because the difference here is marginal & further details are really none of my business, but you're going to have to adjust if you want these kids in your life & from your edits & comments, it sounds like you do which is actually quite heartwarming given the tone of some of the NTA comments here. \nI hope you & your sister get back on track & find a way to communicate properly.
