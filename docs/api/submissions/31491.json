I think I'm with you on not forcing it but I can at least see that logic.\n\nOn anyone else it's baloney.", "Truly - It can be a kind and considerate choice to abstain from partaking in pregnancy-banned foods in solidarity with your partner, or while sharing a meal with a pregnant person, if they are really struggling with those restrictions.  I would do that without hesitation.  But to imagine that no one in your family & social circle may have alcohol at all, at any time, for the duration of your pregnancy, even while travelling for their anniversary is 100% unhinged, unconscionably controlling behavior.", "Actually I think op was more patient and kinder than I would have been!", "Why do the parents even let the sister in their house?

They're the ones who created this situation, and continue to enable it.", "Exactly mom and dad needs to grow a spine and shut her shit down. They are enabling her.

Come on!", "I never asked anyone around me not to drink in my presence or consume foods that I could not have at the time when I was pregnant. That\u2019s stupid.

I really have a passion for good wine and I drink max 2 glass a week. But I love finding, collecting great wines, visiting small domains. And I\u2019m not an alcoholic.

No, no y'all not special.", "It's not necessarily the current generation.  I've known people I worked with 30 years ago like that! \n\nLisa just has bizarre behaviour.  Is this what she's always been like,  and it's just exacerbated through being pregnant, or she thinks being pregnant gives her more of a pass for her already Narcissistic behaviours?  Has it come out of the blue? If it's new,  is there something more behind it? Is she following some sort of Q-Anon conspiracy site that has got her scared and convinced that liver pate and soft cheese somehow emits deadly radiation from up to 100 feet away or something.  Or has she always been the type of person who has been,  \"If I can't have it,  you can't have it!\"?\n\nOP, you're definitely NTA, and this needs to be nipped in the bud,  sooner than later.  It will only get worse if others continue to allow her to indulge in these behaviours.", "Exactly.  If someone tried to make me follow their pregnancy rules, I'd make sure to bring booze with me every time I saw them and maintain eye contact while drinking and make a big fuss about how delicious it is and how fun it is to be buzzed.  I'd also make chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e8 for every occasion and bring some brie as well.

Nope, pouring a good shot of whiskey and savoring it while explaining to her exactly how good it tastes.", "While sitting in a hot tub!", "OMG!

It just seemed like a well-worn phrase the way OP used it. \n\nBut OP is definitely NTA. The younger sister appears to be abusive toward your parents if they react the way described. An entitled bully perhaps?", "The 12 year difference makes me wonder if she is \u201cPrincess spoiled rotten miracle Baby\u201d.

They should have shut it down long ago.", "Oh I agree it\u2019s lovely if a partner offers, but I wouldn\u2019t ever hold it against them.

And the parents should never have gone along and allowed this behaviour.", "Haha, yeah, she was nicer than I would have been, too. I actually LOL'd reading it. That being said, I was trying to see what her parents' POV might have been. As a parent, I wouldn't want to see my kids calling each other names like that, especially when one is pregnant. Right or wrong, it would hurt my heart.

And a margarita.", "Just wanted to check you\u2019re aware that sushi is not necessarily raw fish? Sushi just refers to the preparation of the rice. I can\u2019t stomach raw fish but sushi is one of my favourite foods; either topped/filled with vegetables, meat, or cooked seafood. Obviously there is also the sushi which contains raw fish, or sashimi. \n\nI know you didn\u2019t imply it is raw fish but saying that you can\u2019t bring yourself to eat it seems extreme if you\u2019re aware that it\u2019s essentially just rice and toppings haha", "Lmao! Line up, everybody!", "Lol. But seriously- If she\u2019s breastfeeding and she still won\u2019t be allowed a lot of things so is she going to keep saying others shouldn\u2019t have them too?", "Yep, their parents are probably just jumping on Lisa's crazy train just to stay on her good side so they ensure their ability to see their grandchild once born.", "They kind of are protecting Lisa though. They only complain in private to OP - in public they bend and kowtow to Lisa's entitled demands despite really not wanting to. The fact that they won't say \"no, we're adults and this is our home so if we want a glass of wine we're having one - it has no impact on you\" to her *does* give off golden child vibes.\n\nEspecially if they didn't act that way around OP either time she was pregnant.", "I think \u201cgolden child\u201d is just the Reddit buzz phrase this season.", "Or Australia.", "> Right!

However, this sounds like they were just out in town and no where near her?", "Idk maybe she is a former alcoholic, we often do this kind of stuff for people getting over an addiction, so if she is one (maybe was an undercover functional one) and has quit due to pregnancy that's got to be hard on her I guess.", "See as a parent my philosophy has always been don\u2019t start shit you can\u2019t take. \n\nMy way of thinking is younger sister intruded in an A to B conversation that was none of her business.\n\nSo she got what she ask for.\n\nEven when my kids were little I didn\u2019t intercede to stop fights. My philosophy was unless you see punches getting swung or blood they can work it out.\n\n\nBeing a pregnant in my book doesn\u2019t give you a pass.

When they\u2019re very young I might ask them questions and help them a little \u201cyou both want this you. How will you two solve this?\u201d But in general I want to butt out. I don\u2019t want a difference between them to be about me and I don\u2019t want their resolution to have anything to do with how I feel. I don\u2019t want a legitimate difference of opinion to turn into jockeying for my favor either, because I know a lot of siblings do that.

You have great friends! I specifically asked my gynecologist and he said sushi was fine as long as it didn\u2019t smell off. Back in the US they told me no sushi/raw fish while pregnant. Thank goodness for a more reasonable gynecologist now.", "Mmmm...yes. I don't eat fish, but I LOVE sushi. Veggie sushi especially, but I'm not too proud to eat a chicken nugget stuffed in a sushi roll. Yum--I started ordering that because it was from a very good sushi restaurant in NYC. I figured if they were willing to sell it, I was willing to eat it. (Although in retrospect I suspect it might have been their stealth children's menu. And it was good fresh chicken, not from frozen chix nuggets.)", "I don't like rice much either lmao\n\nMy kid keeps trying to convince me and I'm like...nah you eat it", "I discovered a place that sells garlic steak nigiri it's rare steak on sushi rice with crispy garlic and garlic mayo or something. It was phenomenal. I don't like seafood and especially don't like the seaweed they use in sushi so I usually avoid it but this didn't have seaweed so it was perfect lol. I will hang for my sushi sins I do realize.", "That can work the other way too: \"Baby sitter? You want us to baby sit?

I think it's possible she was the golden child, and is now a nightmare adult. Or it could be she had a spicy personality growing up, and the parents reacted by smoothing out her pathway. Or it could be that she was ill when she was younger, so the parents treated her delicately. Or it could be good ol' \"baby of the family\" vibes. Obviously, we have no data points for any of these (I guess the only data point being the 12-year age difference between OP and the sister)-- the only thing we can see is the parents obeying this ridiculous instruction.", "150 km to get to a town known for wine made me suspect Australia", "Okay that makes sense then. I literally leave myself a spoonful of plain steamed rice in the pan when I plate up food, to eat as a treat after I\u2019ve finished my meal before we wash our dishes haha.
