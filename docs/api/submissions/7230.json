That means no zippers, buttons, jewelery, etc (except for glasses). It also means undergarments need to be fully plastic/non metal boning or clips.\n\nSo that's where we begin\n\nI was running late to work cos of winter weather. When I got in, I went through the metal detector like always, but this time it went off. I had to be scanned by a stand by security officer. So I let him, and my shoulder started beeping. I look to see that it was the ajustment part of my bra.\n\nI tell him that, \"oh. Well that's not good. It was advertised as strong plastic and I got it not too long ago.\" And thought we'd all laugh and he'd let me in.\n\nNope.\n\nHe stood in my way with silence, kinda hesitant on how to speak to me, because, well, I guess telling a woman in front of a crowd her bra is wrong COULD be seen as embarrassing.\n\nHe instead flagged down his supervisor, who walked over all cheery and asked what was up. I showed him my adjuster and explained it was advertised as \"strong plastic\" and that possibly it had some shards of metal in the material. He didn't seem phased and said, \"got a spare in the car?\"\n\nI just blinked and said, \"...no. I do not. Again, this is a bra, not a T shirt.\"\n\nTo which he just went, \"well, you can easily go to Walmart and buy one more suitable.\"\n\nMe: \"So, is the company gunna reimburse me for my time to get it since this is stopping me from working?\"\n\nHim: \"nope. This is a you problem.\"\n\nMe: \"Sir, with all do respect, I don't think I can smuggle diamonds out of a bra adjuster. Can I please just get written up and go to work?\"\n\nHim: \"no. Mistake or not, we can't let you in. So just figure it out.\"\n\nI turned around red faced and left the security room. Maybe I was being sensitive, but being called out by a DUDE about my bra infeont of the whole crowd there was embarrassing! It made me feel very small that they weren't willing to work with me, but instead berate me. Tell me to go away, buy some underwear that's \"better\" and come back. It felt wrong honestly.\n\nWhat do you think I should do? I already just drove away to cool down and told my manager what's up, and he's being understanding. Should I report this to HR?

As for not being willing to work with you, he gave you a solution; you didn't want to do it, so he left it in your hands to sort out. The only other option would have been insisting you come to work braless, which obviously wouldn't have worked.

It\u2019s their job to enforce the rules. It\u2019s your job to follow the rules.", "Just go braless for one day. Bras are annoying anyway.", "But... how would you have had them handle it? I get it was a mistake, but the mistake wasn't their fault. They could have lost their jobs for letting you through. It may seem stupid. It may even *be* stupid. But it's the way it is. They didn't yell or beat you down. They literally just did their jobs. There's not much else they could do.", "It sucks, OP. At least you can leave the never wear again bra in your car as insurance against something like this happening again.", "Good grief. \n\nI don't know your bra situation and if this is a \"minor inconvenience\" or a major issue where you need a specialty fit and this is your only option, but if the latter then you might need to apply for an accommodation.", "Local stores may not even carry her size.", "Diamonds aren\u2019t metal and tgeyre being scanned on the way in. Not out. I don\u2019t see how this can be related to diamond smuggling", "That would certainly make sense if they're being scanned both in AND out.  But I still wonder if there might be a safety concern here as well.", "It doesn't matter, a rule is a rule, you accepted it the moment you accepted the job. In regards to the exception for headphones be glad they let you listen to music, the other option would be to take those away too, would you be happier?   \n\n\nYou can find the rule dumb but there is no point in arguing with the person who is just doing their job enforcing it. Not doing so would mean jepoardizing their job for you for no valid reason", "There are no other solutions, other than:\n1.) Go buy a new bra at a nearby store\n2.) Go home to get a replacement bra\n\nYou're just pissy that they didn't allow you to break the already known rules. The fact the security guard is male is really a non issue, and your focus on that point in particular just comes off as sexist.", "Well, no, wasn't expecting to be. I just figured maybe they've seen similar situations and could've shared what those people did (if they didn't go to Walmart)", "That isn't them being inappropriate though.  \n\nMaybe the solution they offered didn't work, but they tried to help find a solution for her.  \n\nIts not on them to face discipline because she didn't follow the rules", "That is true, but it is still not the company\u2019s problem. \n\nShe knew the policy, she wasn\u2019t in compliance, it is on her to fix it. \n\nIt\u2019s a slippery slope when you start to let \u201clittle\u201d things go that are against a policy.", "I do not think they should face discipline. I *do* think that the policy needs to be reconsidered and the security guards need to be trained not to offer suggestions. These suggestions could expose the company to liability, since there are gender and disability issues at stake here. \n\nThere is no situation in which a woman needs to be told by someone at her workplace that she should go to the store and buy a new bra; this is just basic common sense that the guards and supervisors need to not offer an opinion on her underwear situation because that could go sideways fast.", "It absolutely *is* the company's problem if the security guards are dispensing this as advice, which they did. They need to be trained not to give their opinions (a flat \"this is the policy\" is better and safer) and the policy should probably be revisited because it sounds draconian.", "The security guard didn\u2019t offer advice, the manager is the one who said it. \n\nIt seems like the policy is a \u201cflat\u201d policy, the manager never would have been involved if OP didn\u2019t decide to argue, when she was was in violation.\n\nWhat is draconian about the policy, it is no metal, it is not about any specific item.", "The person who dispensed the advice was the security guard's supervisor. In some situations, a \"supervisor\" in this context would be a higher ranked security guard. \n\nThe policy is draconian because many people with breasts *require* underwire to be comfortable. This is not a policy which affects all genders and all bodies equally."]}
