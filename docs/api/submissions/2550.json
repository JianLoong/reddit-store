NTA !", "I'm stuck between NTA and NAH for this one, because while you are entirely justified in not wanting to have to further share your birthday celebration at this point, the way you described how the conversation in the groupchat went, it seems like you came across as a huge AH. Obviously I don't know the exact content of the groupchat, but there's going to be a bit of a difference in how your stance is perceived between saying \"I've already had to share my birthday and other major milestones with other celebrations for years now, and lumping in someone else's birthday on top of that just feels like adding insult to injury at this point\" and saying \"I refuse to acknowledge someone else's birthday on what should be *my* special day.\"\n\nAnother factor I'd be curious about is if you've previously made your thoughts about this clear. If you've already brought up the subject of your birthdays and many major milestones being shunted to the side, then not going out of your way to spoonfeed it to your family again is entirely reasonable, but if you've never expressed your feelings on the matter before, then it's less that they're being egregiously dismissive of you and more being somewhat oblivious as to how their actions might have affected you.\n\nSo, you're justified either way, but your family members are only TAH here if they should have already known your feelings on the matter from previous discussions.", "NTA. you clearly never got an accomplishment celebrated for just you. it's upsetting especially having to share your special day. a lot of these people saying \"YTA\" don't get it, not everyone feels the same but honestly go celebrate by yourself.", "I get the feeling of being looked over by family and having to share your special events with other people every goddamn time. It's rough. It makes you feel invalidated and small. And the worst part is that other people don't even get why its a problem. \n\nThat said, you have to ask yourself which is more important to you: sharing any celebration with your family or having family to celebrate with. It doesn't get better. People don't change about these things. So its sort of up to you. Would you like to make a big deal about this, and lose the goodwill of your family but gain some personal righteousness and self worth? Or would you compromise and tolerate a bit of effacement in exchange for having your family around you.\n\nI can't answer that for you. What I can say is shouting about it, while perhaps cathartic, won't change things to make people give you that time and respect the way you are hoping.", "NAH - You are an adult, if you don't want to go - don't go.

Explain about how you've been feeling you've never had a big event where the day is 100% focused on you and it finally hit a boiling point. I think if you lay out your side of the argument, she'll begin to see the reasons why you are upset, which all sound valid. \n\nCan you come up with some suggestions that would make you feel good about your birthday and allow your BIL to come as well? \n\nwhat if you did a joint cake on thanksgiving and maybe a bigger party for yourself on Friday or Saturday?

At least that\u2019s how I felt up to a few years ago since now I don\u2019t really care for my birthday because why do people have to fake smile and care on someone\u2019s birthday for one day and can\u2019t just do it for the whole year?

The date of thanksgiving isn\u2019t fixed so it\u2019s not always your birthday, what gives you the right to claim it?

My birthdays were always celebrated on thanksgiving and I often didn\u2019t have a separate celebration even on \u201cmilestone\u201d years until I became an adult and started planning my own birthdays with friends. I understand that it sucks to always share with a holiday, and when you want to celebrate with friends it usually has to be the weekend before or after because there is always at least one friend who will be out of town for the holiday.

It\u2019s tradition to celebrate a birthday and they want to include him in this tradition so he\u2019s not left out. It *is* selfish and a tad bratty to die on this particular hill, especially the way you reacted to your mother. You\u2019re an adult, you have the freedom to plan your own celebration if you have to have a solo birthday party. Your family has shared their thanksgiving celebration with you for years, they made a holiday about gathering and togetherness about you for most of your life, they didn\u2019t have to sacrifice a traditional thanksgiving for a birthday celebration but they did anyway. It could have been cake and ice cream on another day with no extended family around.

He is special too.", "YTA. \nYou\u2019re old enough to at least be in college but you\u2019re acting like an absolute child over a birthday cake. Grow up", "YTA, wtf it\u2019s just a bday people need to stop acting like a day that comes every year is ghat soda it. Sorry, you sound like an attention hogger.", "Idk man, I feel like a dick but I also kinda feel like YTA. My sister and my birthdays are a month apart but we always did a joint celebration.\n\nNow let me explain. You don't always have your entire family gathered to do a big celebration so it's easier and actually possible to celebrate (with *everyone*) in a joint thing. It sounds like your family lumps Thanksgiving and your birthday together and you feel like it's kinda your thing or your day. Why don't you celebrate all the big things happening with your family (your birthday, BIL birthday, thanksgiving) all together as one big celebration and then maybe that weekend or whatever works for you, do something separate that's just for you and your birthday.\n\nINFO: Is it a big deal to have the whole family together or is it something where you all live close and can easily get everyone together with minimal planning?", "NTA\n\nMy birthday occasionally falls on Thanksgiving, and it\u2019s always an afterthought. Thanksgiving plus, hey, you\u2019re here too. Nothing wrong with not wanting to share it with another person as well.", "NTA. If it was just this one time...eh. But there's clearly a pattern.", "NTA - I was born on Father\u2019s Day and the number of times it was overshadowed is ridiculous.  When I was 11, we were with family and cousin was baking a cake for the father\u2019s but no one thought about it was also my birthday.  I ended up baking my own cake since no one else was. \nYou\u2019ve had to share your birthday your entire life and not even on your actual birthday.\nDo not let them force you to share with someone new in the family just because they want them to feel part of.  All that will accomplish is to force you away from them and total resentment of the one doing it.", "YTA for having a fit about sharing your birthday. We always celebrate birthdays that are close together jointly. You\u2019re an adult. It\u2019ll be okay. \n\nHowever, sounds like you need a more serious conversation about these ongoing issues with your family and if it doesn\u2019t change, then it\u2019s time to make your own plans. This year I knew no one was doing anything big for my birthday, so I planned a brunch. Not a big deal.", "[removed]", "I too, was born on Thanksgiving and even when my actual birthday isn\u2019t on Thanksgiving, we still celebrate it on that day. I\u2019ve also shared my birthday celebration with my cousin, who has a birthday a week before mine. Neither of us had a choice in the matter because it was the one time in the holiday season my entire family could get together to celebrate. And it\u2019s been fine. BUT, we\u2019ve been doing this since I was a toddler and he was a baby. Having it sprung on you as an adult without being asked is rude as hell. It\u2019s also immature as hell to say you\u2019ll walk out if you see a cake for your BIL. \n\nSo, I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say ESH.", "So your birthday does not fall on Thanksgiving every year, but the family has to celebrate it on Thanksgiving because that's what you want. Wonderful attitude", "I would send them this post so we can tell them they are the assholes not you. You've been overshadowed enough, you don't need this taken from you too \n\nNTA", "NTA. I have a Christmas baby and break my back making sure it\u2019s completely separate from Christmas. No Christmas wrapping, no Christmas music, I do everything to make sure my son feels acknowledged on his birthday and that it\u2019s **his** day. I could not imagine asking my son to share his day when we already have to combat with Christmas and holiday plans.", "NTA - they treat you like the redheaded stepchild (coming from a literal redheaded stepchild). This sounds like it would be a large chasm to create, though, so think it through. Do you have found family to share your time with? Will everyone write you off entirely? Not saying not to follow your heart, but also give the brain a little input.", "As a baby born five days before Christmas, I can tell you how much your child will appreciate this! It does suck, hahaha! Congratulations to you and your family!", "As a wife who\u2019s husband is a Christmas baby I can\u2019t tell you what a wonderful gift you are giving your child by separating Christmas from their birthday, my husband watched his siblings all have birthday party\u2019s while he never ever got one, he\u2019d maybe get a separate gift from his parents and grandparents but they\u2019d all be wrapped in Christmas paper. To this day my husband hates Christmas. Congratulations on your baby", "My husband was born at the beginning of January. To this day his mom will combine Christmas and his birthday. I make it a point to never combine the two. Your child will be much happier.", "Had my daughter just after midnight on the 26th.  So we have Xmas and the next day is her birthday.  Made a very set rule, separate gifts and birthday gifts could not be wrapped in leftover Xmas paper.\n\nStill do it to this day and she will turn 42 this year.", "Celebrate her half birthday. I know a couple people who do that. It's more enjoyable for everyone.", "I used to have a friend who was a Christmas baby which meant she really never had a party or anything because of the holidays.  As she got older her parents started celebrating her half bday.  She would get some prezzies on her actually bday, but the big stuff and her party would be in July.  That way she had a day just for her.  She loved it.", "My son was born a week before Christmas. We celebrate his birthday that day. It is his day and he loves it. Wishing you all the best with your baby", "My family does the same with me for convenience", "My uncle was born on Thanksgiving and they always celebrated on Thanksgiving too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that unusual as it\u2019s a lot to get everyone together twice in one week.", "It's really not that odd. My brother's bday was nov 25th. We always celebrated it on Thanksgiving.", "We always did it for my grandmother. She was born the 27th so we always brought presents on Thanksgiving since the family was all together. Having also spent my life \"sharing\" family parties to combine birthdays for convenience I'm going to say NTA. It sucks to not have a time just for you. We have a grandbaby born a week before Christmas and we make a deliberate effort to keep the two separate.", "Did she say overlooked or just that the celebrations were combined?", "Except Thanksgiving is on a different day every year, so they're really not a \"holiday baby\".", "I was supposed to be born on Christmas. So glad I\u2019m early cuz even early December it\u2019s easily over looked", "My brother in law, his sister and their mother all have the same birthday (crazy odds, but true). I wonder how they feel sharing their birthday every year. This OP would throw a hissy fit. YTA.", "Agreed", "All of you birthday haters can suck my d. NTA", "No. Thanksgiving isn\u2019t a fixed day, it\u2019s not always his birthday", "So BIL gets no celebration because this ADULT can't handle not being the center of attention?", "I think OP's entire point is that they would like it very much if birthdays were celebrated on the day the person was born rather than being lumped in with other holidays. As in, OP would rather their birthday not be celebrated on Thanksgiving either, but if their family is going to pass on an actual birthday celebration for them for the sake of convenience, then they better not dilute the celebration even further by lumping even more things in there.", "Happy early birthday!", "You are an adult. Plan your own birthday celebration if you want a separate one. People are busy and holidays make that even more true.\n\nFirst world problems.", "Triplet here. Same. I stopped complaining about sharing a birthday ever year when I heard some of my friends say that people don't even remember theirs sometimes. At least all of my family members make genuine efforts every single year to come together for my birthday, since it's for 3 people at one time. And they never forget!", "But it is her BIL so, it would not be her mother planning. It would be their sibling. Also, OP did say they tend to forget them in every memorable occasion except their birthday.", "My dad\u2019s birthday falls on thanksgiving every few years.. we always celebrate it together since it\u2019s easier to gather everyone once!", "The year I was born, I was born on thanksgiving. It has become a staple of celebrating it on the day.", "I know right?", "Since when do people over 21 not celebrate their birthdays?", "But OP hasn't gotten celebrated for his own high school graduation.

As a kid I definitely wanted to celebrate my birthday as a stand-alone holiday", "If OP's family celebrates their birthday on Thanksgiving every year, despite the fact that most years the dates don't actually line up, then there is effectively no difference between OP's situation and a \"real holiday baby.\"", "I was supposed to be born in January. The whole thing is just so frustrating.", "But the family is treating it like it is instead of going to the trouble of letting him have his own party.  Maybe that was okay when he was younger, or even if it was the *only* example of them splitting the focus on special occasions that should be entirely about him, but there\u2019s clearly a pattern here of expecting him to just be flexible and let them squeeze in celebrating him when that\u2019s convenient.", "BIL is an adult too, no?  By your logic, why can\u2019t *he* celebrate some other time?", "OP said in a comment they really like that their birthday is celebrated on Thanksgiving and they don't want to share it because it's 'tradition' now.", "I stopped complaining when I was like 6 and realized how hard it was on my mom to try and make everyone happy.. my twin and I are boy/girl so we were never really into the same stuff! Of course it\u2019s not always fun, but it can always be worse!", "I understand that. Every single one of my milestones in life were also celebrated for my twin sibling.

They can plan their own birthday celebrations now and not even have it on thanksgiving if they don\u2019t want to!", "Same for my dad! We also always celebrate at thanksgiving because there is extra family around. He will also get to pick a dinner on his real birthday with my mom any anyone else who happens to still be in town. For his 50/60/70 milestones we did a separate big party on the Friday after Tday so that everyone would be there.

I don't know a single person that has had one in adulthood. \"Celebrating your birthday\" as an adult means you get a card and maybe a gift at some point during your birth month and someone will probably take you out for dinner at some point during the week of your birthday. It's typically very low-key and not usually a specific \"event\" planned. My husband and I have birthdays the same week, I literally cannot imagine caring in the slightest if someone gave him cake and presents on my birthday because it's easier to do it all at once. \n\nIf someone else getting a birthday cake on the same day as you is enough to make you boycott thanksgiving with your family then you must lead a pretty charmed life.
