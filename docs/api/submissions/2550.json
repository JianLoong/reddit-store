NTA !", "I'm stuck between NTA and NAH for this one, because while you are entirely justified in not wanting to have to further share your birthday celebration at this point, the way you described how the conversation in the groupchat went, it seems like you came across as a huge AH. Obviously I don't know the exact content of the groupchat, but there's going to be a bit of a difference in how your stance is perceived between saying \"I've already had to share my birthday and other major milestones with other celebrations for years now, and lumping in someone else's birthday on top of that just feels like adding insult to injury at this point\" and saying \"I refuse to acknowledge someone else's birthday on what should be *my* special day.\"\n\nAnother factor I'd be curious about is if you've previously made your thoughts about this clear. If you've already brought up the subject of your birthdays and many major milestones being shunted to the side, then not going out of your way to spoonfeed it to your family again is entirely reasonable, but if you've never expressed your feelings on the matter before, then it's less that they're being egregiously dismissive of you and more being somewhat oblivious as to how their actions might have affected you.\n\nSo, you're justified either way, but your family members are only TAH here if they should have already known your feelings on the matter from previous discussions.", "NTA. you clearly never got an accomplishment celebrated for just you. it's upsetting especially having to share your special day. a lot of these people saying \"YTA\" don't get it, not everyone feels the same but honestly go celebrate by yourself.", "I get the feeling of being looked over by family and having to share your special events with other people every goddamn time. It's rough. It makes you feel invalidated and small. And the worst part is that other people don't even get why its a problem. \n\nThat said, you have to ask yourself which is more important to you: sharing any celebration with your family or having family to celebrate with. It doesn't get better. People don't change about these things. So its sort of up to you. Would you like to make a big deal about this, and lose the goodwill of your family but gain some personal righteousness and self worth? Or would you compromise and tolerate a bit of effacement in exchange for having your family around you.\n\nI can't answer that for you. What I can say is shouting about it, while perhaps cathartic, won't change things to make people give you that time and respect the way you are hoping.", "NAH - You are an adult, if you don't want to go - don't go. But you cannot forbid other people from celebrating an additional birthday while you are all together.", "NTA- Sounds like you need to sit down with your mom and lay out just why you are upset. Explain about how you've been feeling you've never had a big event where the day is 100% focused on you and it finally hit a boiling point. I think if you lay out your side of the argument, she'll begin to see the reasons why you are upset, which all sound valid. \n\nCan you come up with some suggestions that would make you feel good about your birthday and allow your BIL to come as well? \n\nwhat if you did a joint cake on thanksgiving and maybe a bigger party for yourself on Friday or Saturday?

At least that\u2019s how I felt up to a few years ago since now I don\u2019t really care for my birthday because why do people have to fake smile and care on someone\u2019s birthday for one day and can\u2019t just do it for the whole year?

The date of thanksgiving isn\u2019t fixed so it\u2019s not always your birthday, what gives you the right to claim it?

My birthdays were always celebrated on thanksgiving and I often didn\u2019t have a separate celebration even on \u201cmilestone\u201d years until I became an adult and started planning my own birthdays with friends. I understand that it sucks to always share with a holiday, and when you want to celebrate with friends it usually has to be the weekend before or after because there is always at least one friend who will be out of town for the holiday.

It\u2019s tradition to celebrate a birthday and they want to include him in this tradition so he\u2019s not left out. It *is* selfish and a tad bratty to die on this particular hill, especially the way you reacted to your mother. You\u2019re an adult, you have the freedom to plan your own celebration if you have to have a solo birthday party. Your family has shared their thanksgiving celebration with you for years, they made a holiday about gathering and togetherness about you for most of your life, they didn\u2019t have to sacrifice a traditional thanksgiving for a birthday celebration but they did anyway. It could have been cake and ice cream on another day with no extended family around.

I\u2019m a slut for mint chip", "My birthday was always right before school started. I was always gifted clothes then told i wasn't allowed to wear them until school started. I'm also a twin, so obviously had to share my birthday. Not the same I know, but it triggered the memory", "my Auntie's birthday is December 26, and she was just told to set aside a gift to open the next day. It's a mess.", "Yeah, birthdays do matter past the age of 18, especially if you grew up feeling like YOU didn\u2019t matter. My birthday is the one day I feel like I matter at all. It\u2019s 95% of the reason that I don\u2019t give a shit about Thanksgiving. From the moment my dad left, my birthday stopped mattering. Between 14 and 26, I had no good birthdays with my family. None.\n\nI get the feeling that this is more than just about OP not wanting to share her birthday.  She mentioned that all of her important milestones were overshadowed by something else.  I absolutely bet that her family doesn\u2019t treat her as if she is important to them.  This one thing is the only thing she ever got that showed how important she was to her family and now they\u2019re taking that away from her.", "Lol valentine's day is about 10 months prior and I believe conception to birth is actually 10 months", "that\u2019s the point of the post is it not? op asking if they\u2019re the asshole for saying they won\u2019t come to thanksgiving if it\u2019s a joint party? i gathered that meant they\u2019d celebrate in their own way.", "Lol it's not that big of a deal. Birthdays aren't as important as people make them in my opinion. This guy's thinks seeing a cake with someone else's name on it and someone else getting gifts is a big deal. Like boohoo you're not the center of attention anymore get over it. It is entitled, and it is selfish.", "This is what baffles me. It's not OP's actual birthday. \n\nOP has had Thanksgiving centered around them for over 2 decades. OP can decline the invite, but the reality is, OP isn't a kid anymore. As people get older, get married, have kids, and the family expands, things change.", "Honestly, my sympathy extends because being an adult doesn't wipe away all of the childhood resentments. It sounds like this is a bigger issue of never feeling prioritized and not just on OPs birthday", "Agreed. It's kinda rude to force your kid to be upstaged by Thanksgiving every year instead of letting them have their own day. My sister was born on Thanksgiving and my youngest daughter was also due on Thanksgiving. I can't imagine celebrating two birthdays on whichever day happens to be the holiday EVERY YEAR. My sister hates it when thanksgiving is on the 23rd because everyone is focused on food (most of which she can't eat because of allergies/sensitivities) and the family usually is too drunk or full to want to do anything else that day.", "Her birthday isn't Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving day is not just about her.\n\nOverlooked her whole life...that's a stretch. She admits milestone birthdays were celebrated separately. Besides, adults shouldn't have some whoa-is-me attitude about sharing a birthday celebration with someone else in the family with a birthday. It is so immature and self-centered. There are thousands of people with the same day being \"all about them\".", "I don't care how often he doesn't feel like the center of attention. There is no excuse to be so mad that someone else gets a cake and presents other than feeling entitled.", "Mine is Jan. 7. The first weekend every one gets to relax after the holidays. No one ever remembers. No one is ever in the mood to do anything. As a kid everyone was always sick that weekend after school starting up and passing every sickness around for a few days. I hate celebrating my birthday now.", "But that\u2019s the thing, his birthday is a week before thanksgiving whilst hers is on or within a few days of thanksgiving. This is her family tradition and she doesn\u2019t want to break it. Also idgaf how old I am my birthday is MY DAY. It\u2019s the one day you can be selfish (to an extent obviously) and the one day that is solely about celebrating you.", "February for me. I got snowed in the few times I tried to have parties after we left the coast. And every year I got discount Valentine's crap. I've never been girly, so a bunch of pink heart stuff and cheap candy nobody actually wanted weren't what I was looking for. It wasn't money, I remember getting a bunch of books one year from some friends. They were all used and cost like a quarter each. But they were things my friends found that they thought I'd like instead of the thing in the giant sale display.", "You need to move to the Southern hemisphere. January is my son's birthday month and it is great. Lovely and hot, days on the beach, etc. He always had a party when he was young. Plus we are paid every fortnight.", "My sons b-day is close to or falls on Labor day too. Along with my aunt and our close family friend that grew up with my momma, aunt, and their brothers. We have our family reunion that weekend every year so we all celebrate their birthdays together. He never cared about sharing the day, even though he's the baby of the family and was sharing with the adults. -They of course didn't care what the cake looked like. The Transformers cake was as good as the Stranger Things cake to them. But to be fair it could also be that he grew up watching his twin siblings and three first cousins share the same birthday week. Three on the 7th, one on the 8th, and one on the 10th. Not counting the family birthdays in the same month on the 12th, 14, 17th, 23rd, and the 31st.  We also have a lot of Christmas b-days and I'm a Father's day present to my Daddy and DH! \n\nWith OP, I say ESH. Only because they're an adult but my heart does hurt for them when they mentioned several milestones being overshadowed by someone else.", "Right? Somehow she doesn\u2019t even realize she\u2019s worth more than just a turkey leg and ice cream. There is absolutely nothing wrong with her wanting to have this day just for herself.", "Then address that with the parents, or acknowledge they\u2019re never going to be exactly who you want them to be, and share your birthday celebration like a boss.", "OP has ALWAYS had their birthday lumped in with Thanksgiving and I get the feeling that they resent that. Now they're also being asked to lump it in with someone else's birthday, too. Ngl I understand where they are coming from. I'm not sure why some people are being so dismissive tbh, other than this weird vibe of 'once you're older than ____ you're not allowed to care anymore'."]}
