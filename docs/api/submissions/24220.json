Especially so because we already had this happening on Valentine's day, when he also gave me chocolate bonbons and I reminded him I was intolerant he ended up eating the chocolates by himself. Back then I was fine with the situation since we had only been together for a few months so I guessed it was natural he didn\u2019t remember I don\u2019t eat chocolate and it was an honest mistake. But I think after a year of dating, and after what happened on Valentine's day he should remember this. Also it annoys me that I spend weeks looking for the perfect gift for him and he just sent me the laziest anniversary gift ever, made worse by the fact that I can\u2019t even eat it. \n\nSo, since I was annoyed and I was not going to eat  the chocolate anyway, I decided he didn\u2019t deserve to eat the chocolate either and I handed them out amongst my coworkers. \n\nWhen I got home he asked me what I thought of his gift and I reminded him I was intolerant to chocolate. He apologized and said he forgot, but promised to make up for it. He asked me what I did with the chocolates and I told him the truth, that I gave them away to my coworkers.

Someone who really cares about you doesn't just \"forget\" a food intolerance. It would be one thing if, say, you just didn't like chocolates and he forgot that. But not remembering that something makes you horrendously sick? I call BS. He knew you couldn't eat the chocolates and figured HE'D get them, just like on Valentine's Day. Is he often this inconsiderate, or is this an isolated incident?", "NTA. You need a new bf. If he cannot remember that even after a previous incident and a year together, he clearly doesn\u2019t care that much. Thank goodness it\u2019s just an intolerance and not an allergy!! And no. There was nothing wrong with giving them to coworkers. That was quite nice of you, even if it was spiteful lol.", "no, NTA. no takesies backsies on gifts.", "YTA. You did it to be petty,", "NTA - so did he just want the chocolate for himself the whole time or what?", "Nta he doesn't get to dictate what you do with your present, he was the one ignorant enough to give you something that is POISON to you.", "NTA \n\n\nBet he won't be stupid enough to get you chocolates again.\n\n\nIf he does, give them to the coworkers again.  \n\n\nSorry just can't shake the feeling that he did remember, but thought he could get the gift credit, but then enjoy said gift all for himself.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t forget. He wanted to give a lazy, low-effort gift, eat the results himself and still get credit.\n\nDo you know what he hates or can\u2019t eat? Give that to him for his birthday or Christmas.", "NTA-it was a gift. If he\u2019s so concerned about what you do with it, it\u2019s not a gift. Tell him to consider it an investment in your career and thus, it\u2019s not wasted. If he wants a say in what you do with a gift, then he should give it to you in his presence so he can watch the pain of receiving such an insensitive gift. He\u2019s thoughtless, and I\u2019m surprised you spent a year with him.", "NTA and I doubt he could\u2019ve returned the candy unless it was factory sealed. You need a new boyfriend who actually wants to make you happy", "Easy NTA", "Wth? Did he buy them assuming you would give them to him and he could eat them?

Boyfriend needs to pay more attention. I think it's nice that you gave them to your coworkers, doesn't matter if it was petty.", "Why be petty? Not every situation calls for it.\n\nThat said, sometimes people share their chocolates.\n\nAlso, BF had a point, he could have retu ned them and got you something else. \n\nESH", "NTA but this man (using the term lightly) sucks", "He gave you a gift that he likes. You can\u2019t eat it? More for him. Except this time you shared with your co-workers. Not what he planned for his candy. \nIf he can\u2019t even remember, or doesn\u2019t care, that you can\u2019t eat chocolate, that tells you everything you need to know about him. You are NTA. He is. Find a better boyfriend.", "It\u2019s only been a year and he\u2019s showing signs of weaponized incompetence. NTA but this is a red flag.!", "OP, the gift was for him but you blocked him from it, hence why he's pissed.  Really reconsider this relationship.", "He'll remember now, I bet. NTA", "NTA they were your chocolates, you can share them with whoever you want.", "NTA\n\nMaybe he should make a bigger effort in remembering these things.", "NTA. They were your chocolates to do with what you wanted. BF was probably counting on eating them from the jump and is actually upset you thwarted his plan.", "NTA- he is going to be like this about absolutely everything else in the relationship.", "NTA\n\nBoyfriend is the AH if anything for his reaction, he should of known that after the Valentine\u2019s Day mistake. He shouldn\u2019t be upset anyways because what he bought wasn\u2019t supposed to be for him, it was supposed to be for her, so it\u2019s her choice what she does with the chocolates anyway.", "NTA. After a year of dating & a previous incident he should be aware of your chocolate intolerance. It was a lazy gift & he is absolutely TA for giving them to you in the first place. As for you giving them out, it was a gift. Whether or not you were going to eat them, he gave them to you & they were yours to give away (or throw away) as you saw fit. Imo he should be lucky you didn't just throw away his \"expensive\" insensitive gift.", "NTA. In fact, I think that was a pretty nice thing for you to do.\n\nIf he can't get you a nice gift (or even remember your dietary restrictions) after a year of being together, that's his problem, not yours.", "NTA. It's your gift. You can do whatever you want with it.", "So he bought chocolate for himself and made it out as a gift for you. If he wanted to he would. You know how you go out of your way to give him something special and he barely makes an effort. You think he is worth remembering his likes and dislikes but I don't think he cares enough to remember.", "ppht. definitely NTA. your boyfriend is TA for 1. getting you a shitty thoughtless gift, 2. not remembering your intolerance to chocolate after the first mishap, 3. getting mad at you for giving away chocolate\u2019s you can\u2019t eat.", "NTA. Shame on him for not remembering, since it's happened before.", "Your gift, your choice. Not everything has to be about him.", "NTA! I'm sorry this guy is 34? This is the most toddler-y tantrum bullshit I've seen in AITA in a minute. Since he's acting like a child and \"forgets\". Tell him big boys don't need mommy or daddy to remind them to be a even semi-decent boyfriend. I'm sorry he can't even remember what makes you sick/allergic to? I don't see this relationship lasting long unless you make yourself a doormat.", "NTA: Your gift so you can choose to do what you want with them. You've every right to be annoyed and his commentary of \"you should have reminded me\" is awful. Are you his mother who should remind him of what he needs to do day-to-day? No, he needs to grow up.", "With that reaction it totally sounds like he DID remember she can't eat chocolate and just thought he could give her a \"gift\" that would end up his and she wouldn't complain because hey omg what a great guy he got her something \ud83d\ude44\nEither way he sounds like an ahole, and if she stays with him I bet he won't \"forget\" she can't tolerate chocolate again", "Ok, let's say he forgot. Why shouldn't she share with her coworkers? He doesn't really have the right to be mad.", "seriously how hard is it to remember a chocolate intolerance??", "How do you return a box of opened candy?", "I'm not OP's BF", "It wasn't opened until she opened it to let thevoworkers have some.", "and i\u2019m asking a basic question", "But if it was a hand packed box of chocolate you can\u2019t return stuff like that because the person could have tampered with the contents and the store can\u2019t resell it. If it was a box of chocolate that is mass produced it may be sealed in shrink wrap or a sealed box which in that case may be exchanged. It still doesn\u2019t excuse him for being pissed she shared with her co-workers, you don\u2019t get to dictate what someone does with a gift", "\"he could've retuened it and got me something else\"\n\nAsk OP's BF\n\nStore have returned money and just tossed the returned product (when it can't be reshelved). It all depends but I personally don't care."]}
