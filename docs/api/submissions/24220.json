After a year of dating & a previous incident he should be aware of your chocolate intolerance. It was a lazy gift & he is absolutely TA for giving them to you in the first place. As for you giving them out, it was a gift. Whether or not you were going to eat them, he gave them to you & they were yours to give away (or throw away) as you saw fit.

He's going with the standard gifts for females which doesn't go well with the ops intolerant for chocolate.

Give them to him to eat?   \nI would've assumed you couldn't return food items unless they had gone bad, so I feel like sharing with the people around you was a reasonable response.    \n\nMy boyfriend keeps a running note in his phone of important things like that because he's forgetful.

It was a lazy, thoughtless attempt on his part, but it was still an attempt at its core. Try to talk it out and get him to understand the importance of it, he just needs to try a bit harder to be more cognizant.", "NTA\n\nAs for your boyfriend, the expected reaction from an adult would have been \"I'm *so* sorry - how could I forget. I'll obviously make up for it. Good thing at least your coworkers got something out of it.\" \n\nPlease draw the appropriate consequences.", "OP you did a lovely thing giving away the chocolates rather than let them go to waste so NTA and since it is your gift you can do whatever you want with it.

You need to remind him to give a shit about you? \nYeah, dude\u2019s lazy. He definitely got those expensive chocolates for himself and remembering about his partner\u2019s food intolerance is too much of a hassle. \n\nThis is not the relationship you need or deserve. There\u2019s far too many potential great loves out there. Make the most out of your time and find someone who can be bothered to care.

Spoiler alert she decides to learn how to bowl and then meets a hot guy at the alley.", "NTA because it's a gift. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't have contacted him.\n\nLook, you gotta really just talk to him; that you feel like you wish he did something more special, or more personal than just chocolates.\n\nI think it's reasonable he could forget a second time about the chocolate, though of course ideally he would have understood at Valentine's day, as you said.\n\nI would have given them away because I can't eat them, so someone should. It's why I let my father eat all the chocolate I get given (which isn't for romantic reasons that I'm given it), but yeah- I can't eat chocolate, it hurts my teeth.\n\nAnd you don't want to grow a resentment against him for this. So again, tell him how you feel if you want things to change.

But still your decision.", "Where do you live that he thinks he would be able to return a food item like that?\n\nHe's an idiot, an asshole, or both.\n\nYou are none of those.\n\nRandom anecdote: my high school boyfriend got me 27 roses for valentine's senior year. 27 had no sentimental value, it was just the most he could get with the money he had on him, because I was \"worth it\" or something. Well, a bouquet of 27 long-stem roses is fucking heavy, especially as a high school student carrying a backpack with everything I own and a purse with even more junk. So I gave away some of the roses to my friends throughout the day. By the end of the day, I had around a dozen left, that were wilting and droopy and sad from being manhandled around a high school all day. He asked what happened to the rest and when I told him I gave them to friends, he was livid. He bought those for me, not my friends, and it was disrespectful that I give away his gift like that. I was like, you gave them to me, they became mine to do whatever I wanted with, and he's honestly lucky I didn't just throw the whole bunch in the trash! To this day (almost 20 years later), I hate receiving flowers as any kind of gift or appreciation. Most people close to me know this.", "NTA, chocolate is a sort of expensive gift but you could do whatever with it that you wished to. I think it is more likely that he believes you are not really intolerant to chocolate and he will manage to show you that it is good.

Either way, as soon as he gave them to her, he no longer had any claim to them; they belonged solely to her, and she was well within her rights to do whatever the hell she wanted to with them.

Bin them?", "He's an asshole but the thing that makes him more of an asshole is that there are so many other things he could have sent her: flowers, nuts, vanilla fudge, cookies, a fruit display, a card that opens into a 3d flower.  The man had so many options but picks the one thing she is intolerant to", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf", "If he don't, she better run", "Bring it home still wrapped up to show she can\u2019t consume it all and make an example of it, have that talk. Emotional knee jerk actions solve nothing and further the rift, y\u2019all just a bunch of jackals that love to see relationships fail for endorsing it.", "That\u2019s likely, ergo me saying he\u2019s mostly the asshole, but we shouldn\u2019t assume someone had the worst intentions. That\u2019s still a simple talk in the end and this is a newer relationship with plenty of time to fix that kind of behavior.", "Ask OP's BF\n\nHe said those words to her.", "She had the talk, she told him she can\u2019t have them last valentines, he did the same thing again. Stop making excuses for him, the chocolates were HER gift not his. If she binned them, gave them away or gave them to him, she\u2019s not the AH.", "Over a year isnt a new relationship but remembering someone cant eat chocolate is very easy. I wouldnt forget if someone told me that", "I\u2019m not making excuses for him, in fact I\u2019ve made it obvious that I think he\u2019s at fault, but OP expressed herself in a slightly immature way. Just because that\u2019s how you\u2019d react doesn\u2019t make it necessarily right. You can never improve a relationship with pettiness, it just leaves everyone trying to claw their way to a false sense of moral victory, and is fundamentally unhealthy coping mechanism."]}
