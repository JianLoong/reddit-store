He's going with the standard gifts for females which doesn't go well with the ops intolerant for chocolate.

Give them to him to eat?   \nI would've assumed you couldn't return food items unless they had gone bad, so I feel like sharing with the people around you was a reasonable response.    \n\nMy boyfriend keeps a running note in his phone of important things like that because he's forgetful.

It was a lazy, thoughtless attempt on his part, but it was still an attempt at its core. Try to talk it out and get him to understand the importance of it, he just needs to try a bit harder to be more cognizant.", "NTA\n\nAs for your boyfriend, the expected reaction from an adult would have been \"I'm *so* sorry - how could I forget. I'll obviously make up for it. Good thing at least your coworkers got something out of it.\" \n\nPlease draw the appropriate consequences.", "OP you did a lovely thing giving away the chocolates rather than let them go to waste so NTA and since it is your gift you can do whatever you want with it.

You need to remind him to give a shit about you? \nYeah, dude\u2019s lazy. He definitely got those expensive chocolates for himself and remembering about his partner\u2019s food intolerance is too much of a hassle. \n\nThis is not the relationship you need or deserve. There\u2019s far too many potential great loves out there. Make the most out of your time and find someone who can be bothered to care. Can be bothered to find a far more interesting gift.", "NTA and I hope your co-workers enjoyed those. Your BF is TA here and rethink things with him", "This is like on the Simpsons when homer got marge a bowling ball (personalized with \"Homer\" on it) as a gift - knowing she doesn't bowl so he could use it for himself. Spoiler alert she decides to learn how to bowl and then meets a hot guy at the alley.", "NTA because it's a gift. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't have contacted him.\n\nLook, you gotta really just talk to him; that you feel like you wish he did something more special, or more personal than just chocolates.\n\nI think it's reasonable he could forget a second time about the chocolate, though of course ideally he would have understood at Valentine's day, as you said.\n\nI would have given them away because I can't eat them, so someone should. It's why I let my father eat all the chocolate I get given (which isn't for romantic reasons that I'm given it), but yeah- I can't eat chocolate, it hurts my teeth.\n\nAnd you don't want to grow a resentment against him for this. So again, tell him how you feel if you want things to change.

But still your decision.", "Where do you live that he thinks he would be able to return a food item like that?\n\nHe's an idiot, an asshole, or both.\n\nYou are none of those.\n\nRandom anecdote: my high school boyfriend got me 27 roses for valentine's senior year. 27 had no sentimental value, it was just the most he could get with the money he had on him, because I was \"worth it\" or something. Well, a bouquet of 27 long-stem roses is fucking heavy, especially as a high school student carrying a backpack with everything I own and a purse with even more junk. So I gave away some of the roses to my friends throughout the day. By the end of the day, I had around a dozen left, that were wilting and droopy and sad from being manhandled around a high school all day. He asked what happened to the rest and when I told him I gave them to friends, he was livid. He bought those for me, not my friends, and it was disrespectful that I give away his gift like that. I was like, you gave them to me, they became mine to do whatever I wanted with, and he's honestly lucky I didn't just throw the whole bunch in the trash! To this day (almost 20 years later), I hate receiving flowers as any kind of gift or appreciation. Most people close to me know this.", "NTA, chocolate is a sort of expensive gift but you could do whatever with it that you wished to. I think it is more likely that he believes you are not really intolerant to chocolate and he will manage to show you that it is good.

Either way, as soon as he gave them to her, he no longer had any claim to them; they belonged solely to her, and she was well within her rights to do whatever the hell she wanted to with them.

Emotional knee jerk actions solve nothing and further the rift, y\u2019all just a bunch of jackals that love to see relationships fail for endorsing it.", "That\u2019s likely, ergo me saying he\u2019s mostly the asshole, but we shouldn\u2019t assume someone had the worst intentions. That\u2019s still a simple talk in the end and this is a newer relationship with plenty of time to fix that kind of behavior.", "Ask OP's BF\n\nHe said those words to her.", "She had the talk, she told him she can\u2019t have them last valentines, he did the same thing again.

I wouldnt forget if someone told me that", "I\u2019m not making excuses for him, in fact I\u2019ve made it obvious that I think he\u2019s at fault, but OP expressed herself in a slightly immature way. Just because that\u2019s how you\u2019d react doesn\u2019t make it necessarily right. You can never improve a relationship with pettiness, it just leaves everyone trying to claw their way to a false sense of moral victory, and is fundamentally unhealthy coping mechanism.", "To note: My mom has been my mom for way longer than 1 year and she still forgets I don't use ketchup for anything. Just saying that people sometimes forget, because it's the most natural thing.", "All he got you for your anniversary was a box of chocolates you can\u2019t eat?? \ud83d\ude05", "Well...\n\nHe won't forget next time.\n\nNTA", "Would he have preferred \"I ate it anyway, because you bought it for me, and spent the day shitting my asshole out and praying to the porcelain god in the office restroom.\" He can lay off.", "He bought those chocolates for himself.", "NTA. he literally planned on you bringing them home for him to eat.\n\nI bet he weaponizes incompetence like he's for a PhD for it.\n\nHe sounds exhausting and like you'd have had a better valentines day (twice now) without him in your life.", "He bought those chocolates for himself, not for you. NTA!", "NTA... He bought them for himself \n\nSharing at work was brilliant", "NTA I truly think he just wanted to eat them himself.

He should\u2019ve put more thought into a gift. I would take a deep look into the relationship.

NTA boyfriend is full of shit.", "Do you really want to be with a man who pulls these kinds of shenanigans?  NTA.", "Your defs NTA.", "NTA He is thoughtless.\n\nA gift is a gift. The recipient may do whatever they wish with it. Never accept conditional gifts.\n\nHe can\u2019t return the chocolates for a refund. Food is not returnable.", "This is the good time for you to review if this relationship is worth staying in. Your boyfriend is a selfish asshole that has demonstrated that he does not care about you the way you care about him. He can\u2019t be bothered to remember your sensitivities and allergies. He thinks it\u2019s your job to remind him. He didn\u2019t buy expensive chocolates for you. He bought them for himself. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t care about you and your wellness. He only cares about himself. So what are you getting out of being in a relationship with a selfish asshole who tried to poison you and make your physically ill? NTA", "NTA, but he sure as hell is.  Kick his ass to the curb now.", "A gift is yours to do with as you like.", "OP I'm almost 100% he would not have even been able to return the chocolates. If they were a high end fancy kind, most of the time they wouldn't take them back. If they were from a chain store they'd be able to take them back but would have to damage them out. Giving them out was the best thing to do in that situation, but I'm also almost positive he was just going to eat them himself. \n\nNTA", "Nta. Lol he didn\u2019t get them for you. He got them for himself. He remembered your intolerance. How dare you give his fake gift to you but really for him away \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA. You should be free to do whatever you please with a gift. The point of a gift is it is now yours. He may disagree with how you used the gift as it isn't something he would have done himself, but he doesn't get to be upset over how you chose to use it as it is a gift.\n\nSeriously though, give him fruitcake for every anniversary from now on.", "NTA", "Sounds like he just wanted to eat those chocolates himself. You\u2019re NTA but you can surely do better than this asshole.", "Ask him where the receipt for the chocolate is? \ud83e\udd28\nAlso, NTA. You should have eaten them when you got home and thrown up all over him.\n\nHe\u2019ll remember then.", "nta - he knew what he was doing.. food items aren't as easily returned anymore.. he would have said, oh they can't return it, and eaten the chocolates", "My husband keeps picking up the plant based ham lunch meat for me at the grocery.

He knows I'm not a lemon fan.", "He got you a bowling ball with Homer engraved on it huh?", "NTA And good luck OP, after more than a decade of marriage my spouse still thinks I like things he prefers because he isn't capable of remembering anyone else's preferences (ADHD, but I find less and less excuse for this every year that goes on.

He has no right to say a peep after giving you something that makes you physically ill. \n\nIs he always like this? Think hard about that and whether you want to get to a second anniversary with someone who treats you like this.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nBut he bought those chocolates for himself, you know.", "NtA. He didn't forget, he bought them for himself. That way, he gets to say,\"I got you a gift, how thoughtful of me,\" knowing full well you can't enjoy them so he can step in and eat the whole box", "NTA. How was he going to make up for it? By letting you go down on him? He's a selfish prick. Your only mistake is wondering if you're to blame. That's a sign that he's succeeding in controlling you with his bad behavior. It's not worth your time to date someone like that, he will never improve.", "NTA.  I bet he remembers from now on.", "Nta\n\nWhen someone is important to you , you will learn what you can about them\n\nWith my ex wife I knew a few things\n\nShe wouldn't eat beans unless they were baked\nWon't eat watermelon\nHated apples, loved apple pie\nAllergic to vicodin \nHad to remember the salt because she cooked without it\n\nI learned this and more in the first year we were married, which is a lot more than she ever knew about me when we divorced after 19 years\n\nI learned it because I wanted to know, it was important for me to know, she couldn't even remember what I was allergic to", "NTA he's upset you have them away so he couldn't eat them", "He just wanted to eat them again.", "NTA Can you return the boyfriend and get something else?", "Well, that was a waste of a year. Don't be silly and expect him to change. If you don't like what you have caught, cut bait and try your luck again. Plenty more fish in the sea than a selfish/thoughtless boyfriend. \n\nNTA but if you're at the point of being petty in return, it's time to move on. He's not worth your efforts.", "NTA.
