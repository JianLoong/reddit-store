For many years I felt university wasn't for me as although I had good grades my self-esteem was pretty low and I thought I wasn't good enough for university and I couldn't even afford it. I worked as an assistant for various departments, and many of my colleagues who taught students said they could see my potential, and they finally encouraged me to apply. I decided to apply for the university and got in, and I was accepted onto four scholarships that are designed for students with lots of potential so I no longer had to worry about applying for student loans and not being able to afford it. \n\nLast year I was meant to be in my final year of university and I should have graduated but a student was making up rumours about me and this lecturer having an affair, which didn't happen. The university soon picked up on these rumours and started their own investigation. At first, the lecturer and I had to stay separated which meant I missed half the classes as she was one of two who was teaching me for that year. Two months later the lecturer got suspended with full pay and five days later the university sent me an email to my personal email account, and told me that I was being suspended, that I was not allowed on university grounds, and that I was not allowed to contact anyone at university. \n\nThe staff who was investigating these rumours fully believed that we were having an affair and we were suspended for nine months so they could find evidence of our \"affair\" As a result of them taking nine months I ended up failing the final year and now I have to retake it. Whilst suspended these rumours about the affair were spreading around the campus fast, and everyone knew. I had a friend who I now consider my best friend who made contact under a secret Snapchat account he asked for my account and he said he fully believed me and started doing his own investigation to find out who it was.\n\nI'm running out of word count. To keep it short after speaking to various students he finally found some evidence that it was a student who made up the rumours and started and reported it to the university. He found concrete evidence and took it to the investigation team and they closed the report and allowed us back to campus. But the student didn't get suspended or punished all she was made to do is retake the third and final year and she had to pay for it whereas I didn't.\n\nNow, I'm in class with her and she struggles a lot and she keeps requesting my help due to me always understanding the assignments and the fact I know what to do. She's fed up with me saying no and spoke to our former classmates and now they are saying I'm an asshole because I'm keeping a grudge against her because of what she did and the fact I nearly lost a degree which I haven't and they stating  I should help her out. \n\nAITA for refusing to help her when she nearly cost me a degree and a teacher her career?", "created_utc": 1703075036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mtdx7/aita_for_not_helping_someone_after_she_almost/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've been in academia for decades and this is not something that I thought would be possible, at least in my country; like suspending someone for almost a year, especially an adult student, based on rumors of having a relation with another adult. I would not want to study/work in such a place lol\n\nFurther, no you don't have to talk at all to this person who ruin your life; I don't even see how you can yourself ask the question if you would be the A at this point. Instead, I would be more likely suing based on defamation or something.", "NTA and anyone who says different is delusional. This girl is lucky that she wasn't sued or jailed for her accusation and rumar spreading. She's responsible for you losing a year's worth of potential income. Did you look into potential lawsuits against her?\n\nOther than not making you pay for your retake year, did they offer any other compensation? At a minimum OP, did university give you a signed letter that you can show potential employers why your transcripts have a blemish on them?", "Absolutely NTA but why was no action taken against the student??? She should be NOWHERE near you \n\nYou\u2019re a better person than me OP, With all that happened to you I would of looked into legal action and made sure that student was banned from campus \n\nDO NOT interact with her or help her in any way", "NTA holy shit!! She endangered your education and career as well as the professor\u2019s. It\u2019s nuts she\u2019d expect anything from you. Clearly she doesn\u2019t understand the impact of her actions. I\u2019d tell her never to speak to me again or I\u2019d go to your university and report her harassment.", "nta. i\u2019m sure life would be easier for the people who want to step on you if you just go ahead and stamp \u201cdoormat\u201d on your forehead, that doesn\u2019t mean you should do it. this is not someone you should be helping, this is not someone you should be talking to, any suggestion that you should not be holding a grudge should be met with disbelief and scorn. ffs. forget about it when she\u2019s out of your life, until then keep it in mind and don\u2019t give her any time, help, or leverage.", "NTA. You don't have to help anyone. Especially not such a person. Just ignore her. It is one year. Then you will never have to meet her again. Don't let her push any buttons of you. Just say a simple 'no' each time, she asks. No explanation, no nothing.", "NTA, but that girl is. Wow, that is high school behavior.  She needs to grow up and ask someone else for help.  Stay as far from her as possible and do not help her if you do not want to help her.", "NTA. Say you are sorry but you had a bad experience about how fast rumour mills work. You can't afford another scandal even though the last one was based on falsities. So you aren't getting close to anyone ti's year, just keeping your head down.\n\nDue to the events before, you aren't a teaching assistant anymore so you aren't in a position to help her and you don't want to risk over-stepping boundaries. Best to talk to the lecturer who can best support her.\n\nAnd then just blank her. If people say you are holding a grudge, ask them why would you be? And ask if they understand why you can't risk any more rumours, however well intentioned they were. But you are glad that they can help her out.", "NTA", ">a student was making up rumours about me and this lecturer having an affair, which didn't happen.\n\n>The university soon picked up on these rumours and started their own investigation. At first, the lecturer and I had to stay separated which meant I missed half the classes as she was one of two who was teaching me for that year.

So slander/libel doesn't apply to the university's code of conduct? \n\nThis whole story seems made up or paints a picture of a very inept administration.  I'm very skeptical of this story. \n\nESH", "NTA. I'd see if you could get a Restraining Order against her that would force her to stay out of any classroom you were in.", "Avoid her. Let her sink her own ship.\n\nTell other students you cannot risk being around her.", "What!!?? Wow. What a story! I'm very sorry for you.\n\nNo, NTA, this person is objectively dangerous. Stay away for your safety. Think of the most neutral way to say that she uh really fucked you over, and it's just a practical matter to stay away. No need to be nasty, it's sensible. How quickly the truth of that sinks in is not your concern.", "NTA. If I were in your position, I would never speak to this student again. What she did was unforgivable, and she nearly screwed up your chances big time.

She's also cost you a year of post-degree earnings. \n\nShe's VERY lucky to still be allowed to study there, and you are under no obligation to help somebody who hurt you so badly. Why don't her friends help her?\n\nHonestly, I would refuse to interact with her in any way. She could start making up new rumours if she managed to glean any information about you.", "NTA\n\nThat's the scorpion that stings the fox because its there nature but in fact they missed and the fox swims off and the scorpion can't swim after all screaming for the fox to save it.  NO.  Why are none of these others offering her help?  How many of their lives were impacted by her negligent and horrific accusations. You have no obligation to help and every reason to avoid her.  Anyone saying your wrong for holding a grudge ARE NOT the type of people you want to deal with because they have a skewed set of morals and no sense of proportion.
