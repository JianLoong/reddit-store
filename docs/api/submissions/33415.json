For many years I felt university wasn't for me as although I had good grades my self-esteem was pretty low and I thought I wasn't good enough for university and I couldn't even afford it. I worked as an assistant for various departments, and many of my colleagues who taught students said they could see my potential, and they finally encouraged me to apply. I decided to apply for the university and got in, and I was accepted onto four scholarships that are designed for students with lots of potential so I no longer had to worry about applying for student loans and not being able to afford it. \n\nLast year I was meant to be in my final year of university and I should have graduated but a student was making up rumours about me and this lecturer having an affair, which didn't happen. The university soon picked up on these rumours and started their own investigation. At first, the lecturer and I had to stay separated which meant I missed half the classes as she was one of two who was teaching me for that year. Two months later the lecturer got suspended with full pay and five days later the university sent me an email to my personal email account, and told me that I was being suspended, that I was not allowed on university grounds, and that I was not allowed to contact anyone at university. \n\nThe staff who was investigating these rumours fully believed that we were having an affair and we were suspended for nine months so they could find evidence of our \"affair\" As a result of them taking nine months I ended up failing the final year and now I have to retake it. Whilst suspended these rumours about the affair were spreading around the campus fast, and everyone knew. I had a friend who I now consider my best friend who made contact under a secret Snapchat account he asked for my account and he said he fully believed me and started doing his own investigation to find out who it was.\n\nI'm running out of word count. To keep it short after speaking to various students he finally found some evidence that it was a student who made up the rumours and started and reported it to the university. He found concrete evidence and took it to the investigation team and they closed the report and allowed us back to campus. But the student didn't get suspended or punished all she was made to do is retake the third and final year and she had to pay for it whereas I didn't.\n\nNow, I'm in class with her and she struggles a lot and she keeps requesting my help due to me always understanding the assignments and the fact I know what to do. She's fed up with me saying no and spoke to our former classmates and now they are saying I'm an asshole because I'm keeping a grudge against her because of what she did and the fact I nearly lost a degree which I haven't and they stating  I should help her out. \n\nAITA for refusing to help her when she nearly cost me a degree and a teacher her career?", "created_utc": 1703075036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mtdx7/aita_for_not_helping_someone_after_she_almost/", "score": 1832, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That could easily be construed as a sex for grades situation.", "Yes I agree that it is not ethical due to the nature of the relationship : conflict of interests (play favorite?), also lecturer - student romantic relation can led to many problems fast (imbalance), and this is real for any institutions I know, we are on the same boat here.\n\nbut the burden in that case would be on the lecturer (?) since they were having kind of a leadership role; \n\nwhile in the present situation, the student have a huge suspension and consequences based on suspicions, where, if we follow the train of thought of the suspicions, they may instead be more of an hypothetical victim (?) in the scenario, then the 'perpetrator'; this is the part I find weird", "yes I agree with what you are saying\n\njust that it seems like harsh consequences in general for the student who may be more 'a victim' or the vulnerable one in the story", "It can be hard but you should fight. \n\nI was in a similar situation (different issue though) where I was so emotionally exhausted that I just wanted it to be over. My friends convinced me to find a lawyer that\u2019s done university cases before and I\u2019m so glad they did. \n\nLooking back at it, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to heal and recover if I just let it go. It would\u2019ve lived in the back of my mind and I would be stuck on the fact that even though I was the wronged party, it wasn\u2019t fair that the consequences meant I was the one being punished which is what is happening to you. \n\nIt\u2019s not that the goal is to hurt the girl\u2019s life/career like she was trying to hurt yours but, at least for me, knowing that I had done everything in my power to stand up for myself was a big step in recovering and moving forward. On days where it was extra hard, it helped me to think that I wasn\u2019t just doing this for myself but so that hopefully this wouldn\u2019t happen to anyone else but if it did, there would be a good system in place for how it needs to be handled. Maybe it would help you if you reframed it as fighting as a way to honor your friend that fought for you and got the evidence. \n\nHonestly, once I found a lawyer, they did almost everything for me. I had to meet with them to tell them the story, a few times for updates, and then for the meeting with the university. It\u2019s scary at first but having one means you\u2019re not fighting alone and realistically they\u2019re doing most of the fighting for you so while still hard, it\u2019s not as intimidating as it seems at first. \n\nAs others have said, many universities offer legal services. Start there but don\u2019t stop with them and go in with the understanding that they might not be the best fit. Yes these are services for students but depending on how they\u2019re associated with the university they might not be as willing to take the lead. \n\nI ended up looking at lawyers local to the university.

Not because I was abusing it, but because I had/have a pretty nasty anxiety disorder and this is how I learned that some drugs completely short out my memory -- I literally did not know I had already taken it.\n\nThe RA on my floor told my roommates that I had attempted suicide, when I plainly hadn't. Even if I _had_, under both the law and university policy, that was not her information to share.  She told my roommates that it was their responsibility to watch out for me now.\n\nUnderstandably, they didn't appreciate this, especially since I was the oldest in the suite.  Much less understandably, they took it upon themselves to each file completely bogus things with the university that I was threatening them, that I was dangerous, that I kept them up at all hours (I slept 12 hours a day, how did I keep you up when I was asleep?), that I was drinking in my room (I didn't drink until I was 25), that I had stolen video games (the only game that I had ever used of theirs was legitimately lent to me, and I gave it back a week later), all kinds of flat out lies.  \"If he doesn't care about his own life, how can he care about ours\" was a common phrase in all of the complaints.  Someone put that phrase in the others' heads.\n\nThe only \"dangerous\" behavior I had, they didn't even know about -- I have a long history of self harm.  That's it.  Not once was any of that brought up.\n\nThe \"hearing\" was them talking about how awful I was to live with, and since I'm a normal goddess-damned human, I never would have thought to record my day to day life.  Of course I had no evidence about the fact I didn't do something, because how do you prove a negative?  They could lie and lie and lie, which they did, which the RA did because she knew she fucked up and she didn't want to get fired, and I had absolutely no way to defend myself, because who tracks that they *didn't* threaten someone?\n\nI was kicked out of uni, and told I could try again next year.  Completely screwed up my financial aid status, badly enough I could restart school for several years after all of this.  I appealed to the director of Student Life, because housing was under his purview, and this man whose entire tenure at the university was marked by being one of the few genuinely anti-white racists I have ever met in my life looked me in my eyes and said \"mentally ill people like you don't deserve an education.\"\n\nI didn't get back to school until a few years later.  Completely independent on my FAFSA now.  I managed to get by, and now I have a house and a husband and stuff.  I've done okay, all things considered.  But I never should have had to suffer like that.\n\nTurns out, though, that I had the last laugh.  A friend of mine let me know years ago that my RA ended up getting caught drinking, and thanks to both school policy and state law, getting caught drinking underage completely shattered her career plans.  One of my roommates was a criminal justice major, and he ended up committing just a wee felony along the way.  Another was a pre-med major (at a crappy state school) and never actually got into med school, despite the best tutors his daddy's money could buy, and is now a pharma rep, which *really* pisses his dad off.  The third roommate, who made it pretty apparent he was going along with it because the other two were and he didn't want them to turn on him, he's happily employed as a gym teacher now.", "It\u2019s never \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d it\u2019s pass judgment and hope for the best", "See: Yale", "Is it not a bit silly to go to the university law department when it should probably be the university they're suing?\n\nThe student may have started this, but it was the universitys intense witch hunt that caused most of the issues.", ">She's fed up with me saying no \n\nSeriously, who gives a f**k! Let her be fed up as long as she stays far away from you. Don\u2019t go near her! \n\nUnless, of course, you take legal action against her. So sorry you had to deal with this absolute insanity.", "You absolutely need to contact the university and advise that you are being harassed by her. She is continuing to turn other students against you with her current behavior and you need to nip it in the bud.   If they do not take it seriously, escalate and go full scorched earth.", "Just to chime in here: it's not just that they were *wrong* about an affair - and clearly investigated terribly, if it took them nine months to fail to find something a fellow student found without any of their resources or ability to compel people to cooperate.\n\nLet's imagine you *were* having a sexual relationship with a professor who was teaching you. Yes, you're an adult, but you're an adult *very much in a vulnerable position vis-a-vis someone with power over your grades and ability to graduate.* That they suspended the *professor* they suspected - very likely with pay - is not particularly a misstep. That they suspended the *student*, as opposed to treating you as a potential victim of predatory behaviour, is a *wild* choice in 2023. That they did it while cutting you off from your support network with the threat of expulsion is even more so. If that nine months was an upfront number they set, there's no way not to construe that as a punishment without due process - it doesn't sound like there were hearings where you got to put your case, right? - this sounds very likely to be a due process violation on their part as well. At least from an outsider assessment, this sure does look like several different Title IX violations (though, to disclaim clearly: I don't practice law, my qualifications aren't from the US, and I'm not qualified to do more than tell you to talk to a suitable lawyer about the possibility), among other federal and state regulatory issues.\n\n(Also, not to throw another kettle of fish into the pile, but - you and the lecturer in question are both female, yes? This is such a terrible way of handling the entire situation that I do wonder whether that played into their choices. How's their code of conduct - and track record - on supporting LGBTQIA student rights?)\n\nIt is very likely that a well-drafted legal letter from a reasonably serious law firm will get you an offer in return for agreeing to not pursue a lawsuit, no further legal action needed. Cost of therapy, and loss of earnings for the year delay on entering the workforce would be a very, very reasonable starting point for a demand letter. I would *not* go student legal aid for this - do a search for law firms in your local area who specialise in employment and discrimination law, and reach out to 3-4 of the best-reviewed ones, particularly any with a good track record of supporting students making sex-based discrimination claims. It's usual to be able to get a first consultation free, and for something as clear-cut as this, it's very likely that they'll work on contingency (i.e. for a cut of what the university offers you). They will also be able to give you advice on whether you can wait to send it until after you graduate, if you're worried about retaliation (which would create more legal liability for them, but they've handled this so badly so far that it would be an understandable concern). Going via a law firm signals that you're willing to take it further - even if you're not, though I'd delete this post to reduce the chance they find it and know they can low-ball you - and if it does take more than a letter, a good one will support you through that process and minimise how much you have to do on your own.", "I feel like your issue with her shouldn\u2019t be one. Just out what she did to the other classmates, esp once\u2019s she\u2019s complained to, and have them take your side since it\u2019s a no brainer that she hurt 2 ppl\u2019s lives massively. Maybe even just report her for harassment as well?\n\nThe University should be PAYING you for time lost tbh. It\u2019s worth legal action.\n\nAlso, is she was supposed to graduate, why is she having so much trouble again with what should be 3rd year material? I think it\u2019s worth questioning whether she cheated to begin with.", "What about opportunity cost?  If you had graduated two years ago, you would be two years into a career with a salary.  They owe you two years of salary, and that does not even include the emotional toll.  I would also include therapy bills for the past two years, and also future therapy bills.\n\nHow did you prove that this girl was the guilty party?  Did she admit it?", "I would go after her with in mind what you would of made in first year of working.\n\nAt the very least sit down with a lawyer, do you still live at home speak to parents they may have legal cover on insurance.", "> I'm so mentally exhausted and I feel empty and I don't know if I have it in me.\n\ngraduate, celebrate, get some rest, get a high paying job and FUCK HER LIFE UP IN THE WORST WAY YOU CAN THINK OF", "any idea WHY she spread those rumors? and know, you are NOT! amazes me that former classmates would take her side! \"yeah, she almost destroyed a man's career and ruined your schoolwork and reputation. but, help her anyways!\"", "Check with a lawyer to find out what your statute of limitations is. That will give you some time to think it over, get through school and decide what you want.\n\nAlso, if you are in the US: Look into the suit against Yale by the student falsely accused of rap\\*ing another student. he was just given permission by the CT courts to sue not only Yale but his accuser for defamation. its goin to be a precedent for how BS that happens with these university investigations is actually treated under the law. Something you may want to legally rely on if you can. (dont waste your time on the NYTimes article about it though, its all about how alleged victims are going to be harmed by this precedent and frankly the accuser in that case needs to be dragged through the legal process by her toenails for what she did.) Overall pretty heartening.", "But, one teacher is \"one of two teachers\" so they missed half the classes? That is quite unlikely at the college level. \n\nAlso, what happen in situation when your lecturer can not test you is that you get different exam administered by someone else.", "r/nothingeverhappens", "Exactly, it's a university not a high school.", "You need to protect yourself, where the university failed you.", "Yeah I really don't understand this situation. Say the lies were truth - why would that mean suspending OP for 9 months?", "The people suggesting OP go to the law department of their university are a bit mental imo. They should probably be sueing the school, I doubt their own legal department is the best way to do it.\n\nIts fine advice normally for students who might forget it's a resource, but I can't imagine they'd even get involved with a school matter like this even if OP just focused on the student.", "Actually no. That's even more than where I went, impressive!", "If they're about to graduate they might only have a couple classes left. And if the faculty suspect a student of breaking the rules strict colleges would absolutely do what OP described, trying to get the person to just drop out and save them from actually having to expel anyone.", "If it were true it would have ended in expulsion not with a 9 month suspension. They suspended her and didn't do crap, they expected OP and the teacher to move on instead of fighting it is my bet. Guilty parties usually take the out.", "are student unions a thing there? we had free legal advice as part of that.", "It'd be a slam dunk if there's concrete evidence. This did tangible damage to the OPs life.", "> You\u2019re assuming one person did some huge conspiracy against these two. \n\nUm\u2026 nope, that\u2019s not what defamation is.\n\n> Possible, but the more likely scenario was she told an original rumor, \n\nYep, that\u2019s defamation.\n\n> but the campus spread and enhanced it like wildfire, which is usually what happens. \n\nOf course it\u2019s what happens. Which is why defamation suits exist. She\u2019s still responsible for the consequences of the lie she told. This is a totally foreseeable consequence, as you so clearly outlined. \n\n> That is not a police matter. OP and the teacher could sue, for damage and malice. \n\nCorrect \n\n> They would have to prove quite a bit though, \n\nIf there\u2019s definitive proof\u2026 I don\u2019t think so. Damages aren\u2019t hard to prove either. \n\n> and would get stuck with legal fees if they lost\n\nCorrect.", "I mean literally why would OP face any consequences? What is the wrongdoing in this case on the student's part? I feel like I'm missing something. In my experience, if a professor were sleeping with a student, it would be the professor who might be doing something against university policy, not the student.", "Some places get rid of both the professor and the student as they consider the student to have cheated. No evidence of cheating is needed if they can prove an affair. Makes no sense to me and it's not the same for highschool for obvious reasons but it's not completely unheard of.", "I work at a college in America and our only rule is we can\u2019t be a direct supervisor or teaching them.

I just let my dept chair know my boyfriend was attending the university and when he took one of the mandatory classes in my dept I made sure to not interact with the professor teaching it.", "Wow that's wild"]}
