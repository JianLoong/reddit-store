It's not worth stressing over every ridiculous thing someone says.", "I'd be giving her the side eye as a possible bigot. Would she have had this reaction to a straight couple making this joke?\n\nWeird.\n\nEta: my niece and nephew are twins, and this is a pretty frigging stupid question. They looked nothing alike as babies!", "it was definitely an overreaction and u didn\u2019t do anything wrong! but since u said u haven\u2019t interacted with her before, u probably wouldn\u2019t know if she did have previous trauma related to this ya know? so please be reassured u did not make an offensive joke or anything, but try to hold some empathy and benefit of the doubt for this person; many survivors can be triggered by normal interactions between child and caregiver. obviously it doesn\u2019t give her the right to be mean and accuse u of something terrible, bc that made u feel gross and bad and that\u2019s not ok, but i honestly doubt it was done as a personal attack on u or anything", "Cheeky jokes are the best kind in my opinion.

When did everybody get so tetchy!", "People are weird about twins.  I am a twin and I am female, my twin is male.

If anyone sexualized your child here it's her.", "I can't tell you how many dirty looks and snide comments I've had about our kid (almost 11m) wearing cool clothes in the cold.\n\nThe thing is, I can't get him to even bring a jacket, let alone wear one. Same thing with pants instead of shorts. He just won't have it. \n\nHis mother and him are Alaskan Native and I'll be damned if they don't have a furnace packed in with their internal organs. I couldn't pin-point what causes it, but I have zero doubt that there is a genetic difference regarding internal temperature.\n\nI used to be pretty resistant to him not wearing clothes I thought were warm enough, but eventually you just have to trust that they know what's comfortable for their body.", "I was the same as your son in that regard. I'm not from that far north, though. As a kid in winter, my mom would always try to force me to bundle up way too much. I was often overheated to the point where I was physically sick. Eventually, she caught on that as long as I had mitts and a hat, I'd wear them if I needed them.  \n\nNow we have an expression in our family \"What's a sweater?\" The joke answer is \"something a child wears when their mother is cold,\" but it means \"you're telling me to do something you should do.\" So whenever my mom tells me I should rest because she's tired, or eat more because she's hungry, I tell her \"What's a sweater?\"", "My mom used to also often tell us to put on coats/zip up etc, once though literally told my brother to put on a coat because it made HER cold to see him without it! \n\nShe's part southeast asian & ireland is very cold feeling due to the damp. XD", "That's funny. My mom is Irish, but I grew up in Canada (which makes Ireland's winters seem quite mild - it was -40 here last week).", "Yeah might be mild temperature wise but damp cold just seems to make you feel cold through multiple layers! I've lived in Germany & loved the snowy winters there, was temp wise colder but felt fine once you were kitted out XD \nNot sure Ive ever experienced -40c though, that's way cold!"]}
