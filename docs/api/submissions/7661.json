We had a really hard time accepting the fact, but Anna was much more affected, she would cry in our bed for at least 4 hours every day, she wouldn't eat, and she would say awful things about herself and her \"useless body\". I had tried to console her to the best of my abilities but I was grief-stricken myself and couldn't say the right words to her.

I was stunned and turned to my wife having an emotionless expression until she smiled slowly and congratulated them, and hugged them both.

SIL comes walking towards me and starts yelling at me saying that I'm doing this because of her announcement, I tried telling her as calmly as possible that it wasn't like that and this was supposed to be Anna's birthday party, not some pregnancy announcement party. \n\nI said my goodbyes, then 2 hours later, I get a message from my brother saying I was selfish and that I \"shouldn't be jealous just because we won't be as careless as the two of you\" careless as in implying that we had somehow caused the miscarriage even though we were incredibly careful. \n\nI'm beyond frustrated.\n\n Do you think IATA because of how I handled the situation?", "created_utc": 1674057969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fb1cp/aita_for_asking_all_the_guests_to_leave_after_my/", "score": 3907, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, reddit wants to fight your brother \ud83d\ude02", "NTA!!! Honest your brother and sil have no idea they barely just announced something could also happen to their baby to make such a shitty comment. And they should have said it at their anniversary not your wife's birthday so inconsiderate", "NTA. Forward that message to your entire family. Your brother is awful. And stupid. Miscarriages happen despite all precautions. It was awful for them to announce their pregnancy at her birthday. It's terrible they would make any major announcement on her birthday. Let's make her day all about them.", "YTA only to the extent that you were so weak in your response.  I would not have been saying, \"It's not like that\" to these ignorant, insensitive people. It IS like that.  They were AH's who hurt you and your wife.  Torched earth.", "Given how heroically calm this fella is, I don't take him for the airing out his dirty laundry and sabotaging for revenge type. He seems way too kind. And in this rotten world? That's an amazing virtue he should hold onto and never let go of.\n\nOP...I'm so terribly sorry for what you're both going through. I can not begin to fathom her pain.

I\u2019ll add to it: their dog/cat is NEVER house-trained & always shits where they step in it. That they never another orgasm together again - or at all, who knows, the fates decide.

They aren\u2019t something to be ashamed of and are incredibly common. I had four kids, four miscarriages so those numbers alone let them know how common they can be.

You might have to wait a couple days with a corpse inside you.", "Same. My first pregnancy ended in miscarriage, and I was devastated, best thing my said Doctor (bless her) was \u201cIt is nothing you did, or didn\u2019t do.\u201d Please tell your wife that also.
