We had a really hard time accepting the fact, but Anna was much more affected, she would cry in our bed for at least 4 hours every day, she wouldn't eat, and she would say awful things about herself and her \"useless body\". I had tried to console her to the best of my abilities but I was grief-stricken myself and couldn't say the right words to her. It took 4 months of therapy for us to gradually start feeling better, Anna was smiling more, she was still a little on edge, but she was doing good. \n\nJanuary 14th was Anna's birthday and I wanted to make it really special for her, I invited our friends and family and cooked her favorite foods, I just wanted this day to be happy for her. \n\nFor context, our families know about the situation and the effect it had on Anna, especially my brother and SIL, as we had stayed in their house for a bit.\n\nWhile everyone was eating the food my brother and SIL got up and told everyone that SIL was pregnant. After 4 seconds of silence, everyone in the room started congratulating them. I was stunned and turned to my wife having an emotionless expression until she smiled slowly and congratulated them, and hugged them both. For a good 20 minutes, everyone couldn't stop talking about pregnancy, baby names, and new baby toys.

SIL comes walking towards me and starts yelling at me saying that I'm doing this because of her announcement, I tried telling her as calmly as possible that it wasn't like that and this was supposed to be Anna's birthday party, not some pregnancy announcement party. \n\nI said my goodbyes, then 2 hours later, I get a message from my brother saying I was selfish and that I \"shouldn't be jealous just because we won't be as careless as the two of you\" careless as in implying that we had somehow caused the miscarriage even though we were incredibly careful. \n\nI'm beyond frustrated.\n\n Do you think IATA because of how I handled the situation?", "created_utc": 1674057969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fb1cp/aita_for_asking_all_the_guests_to_leave_after_my/", "score": 1163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry SIL is being a shit.", "NTA", "Eww your brother is a dick and obviously never took any health classes or know anything about babies. Also your SIL is a dick too. Why couldn\u2019t they have just waited?!? You did absolutely nothing wrong. And your wife did absolutely nothing wrong. \nYou sound like a great husband, and you WILL be a great father. I am so sorry this happened. But seriously your brother is a dick, and his wife too. I cannot emphasize this enough. Dicks!", "No you took the high road. Those two deserve each other. It was totally wrong for them to take over the birthday party and make it a baby announcement, and very insensitive.", "You're brother is an AH, and I would have serious issues with his text.

The birthday is about your wife, not SIL.", "NTA absolutely, 100%. I would consider going LC with your brother and SIL. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. It sounds to me like you handled a difficult situation really well. Your brother and SIL are being insensitive jerks. I would consider cutting off contact until your brother apologises for his awful \u201ccarelessness\u201d comment. That\u2019s way beyond the pale.", "I would ghost them at that point. Literally block them on everything. Tell your family via mass text or mass email exactly what they said and  if you hear another word about them you are going to cut them out too. \n\nThat sentence is unforgivable. It is HEINOUS to tell you that you murdered your own desperately wanted child.\n\nNTA", "Cute the whole damn family off, honestly. What absolute trash. I would be absolutely blinded by rage, and I don't know how you're not. This is so fucked up and I hope that if you don't cut your family off that your wife does, even if she has to divorce you so that she never EVER has to come in contact with those hateful people ever again.", "NTA, but I would have said something at the get go instead of letting them carry on.

Like I've been there, not with a miscarriage, but other traumatic life events with my wife and seeing her so depressed and sad \n\nThe rest of your guests will understand, especially those seeing you SIL's outburst. They knew better. \n\nI wish and your wife all the best", "NTA\n\nEntitled SIL and brother tried to takeover a party for their news and you tried to handle it quietly and help your wife.

How heartless you are NTA. I would cut off contact with brother and SIL. Especially after the terribly cruel comment they made!", "NTA - Announcing the pregnancy in a birthday party of your wife who got a miscarriage? The audacity of your brother is insane, and even insulting you with the last thing.

I'm very sorry for the miscarriage, and please go NC with your brother", "Tell him to go fuck himself", "Absolutely NTA.

I\u2019d go absolute no contact with no explanation. You weren\u2019t the AH anyway, but your brothers text was absolutely disgusting.", "Wooooah huge NTA. You were compassionate and protective of your partner. Your family was entitled and bananas. The pregnancy comment--I can't even. 25% of first trimester pregnancies end in miscarriage so those aren't odds anyone can be smug over. Damn.\n\nYour brother and SIL knew exactly what they were doing. Who announces ANYTHING on someone else's birthday? At the birthday person's house? In the middle of their celebration?! Wild.", "Nta", "NTA that brother would be dead to me after a comment like that, there's no coming back from something that cruel.", "> won't be as careless as the two of you\n\nLook, I am not an angry man, but I probably would have killed your brother had I been in your shoes. NTA, what they did was selfish and all types of wrong. That is disgusting. I would cut him out after that if that is how he feels about you two", "NTA at all but your brother and SIL are huge AH. They should\u2019ve waited until their own party to announce this. This was supposed to be about your wife and they knew the grief you went through. Also their comment about you guys being careless would\u2019ve been enough for me to go NC for the foreseeable future.

Kinda feels like she was one-upping OP's wife.", "I don't think my jaw has ever dropped while reading a story here, but your brother's words just did. And then I shed a few tears for you.  I know the feeling of losing a pregnancy but couldn't imagine having someone be so callous.\nNTA, cut off contact but definitely share the message he sent with the rest of your family.", "NTA. Oh HEEELLLLLLLLL no! SIL knew this was because of the announcement, therefore she knew she was ruffling feathers. You both handled this way better than I would have.", "Holy shit!
