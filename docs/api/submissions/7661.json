August 23rd, 2022, my wife woke me up in tears, she tossed her blanket off from her legs to show me a big patch of blood near her crotch, staining the sheets. We had a really hard time accepting the fact, but Anna was much more affected, she would cry in our bed for at least 4 hours every day, she wouldn't eat, and she would say awful things about herself and her \"useless body\". I had tried to console her to the best of my abilities but I was grief-stricken myself and couldn't say the right words to her. It took 4 months of therapy for us to gradually start feeling better, Anna was smiling more, she was still a little on edge, but she was doing good. \n\nJanuary 14th was Anna's birthday and I wanted to make it really special for her, I invited our friends and family and cooked her favorite foods, I just wanted this day to be happy for her. \n\nFor context, our families know about the situation and the effect it had on Anna, especially my brother and SIL, as we had stayed in their house for a bit.\n\nWhile everyone was eating the food my brother and SIL got up and told everyone that SIL was pregnant. After 4 seconds of silence, everyone in the room started congratulating them. I was stunned and turned to my wife having an emotionless expression until she smiled slowly and congratulated them, and hugged them both. For a good 20 minutes, everyone couldn't stop talking about pregnancy, baby names, and new baby toys.

SIL comes walking towards me and starts yelling at me saying that I'm doing this because of her announcement, I tried telling her as calmly as possible that it wasn't like that and this was supposed to be Anna's birthday party, not some pregnancy announcement party. \n\nI said my goodbyes, then 2 hours later, I get a message from my brother saying I was selfish and that I \"shouldn't be jealous just because we won't be as careless as the two of you\" careless as in implying that we had somehow caused the miscarriage even though we were incredibly careful. \n\nI'm beyond frustrated.\n\n Do you think IATA because of how I handled the situation?", "created_utc": 1674057969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fb1cp/aita_for_asking_all_the_guests_to_leave_after_my/", "score": 519, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d go scorched earth after what they just pulled. Disgusting people\u2026", "NTA but your brother and SIL are. They hijacked your wife\u2019s birthday, and to top it all off, implied she was \u201ccareless\u201d when she miscarried.\n\nI am sorry for your loss. I also think it\u2019s best you two distance yourselves from these cruel people.", "NTA. You need to grow a spine and rip your brother and his wife a new one.", "First of all, I am so so sorry for yalls loss and im very happy that therapy is helping yall. Second, youre NTA and you nicer than me. My sibling ever said some shit like that to me or my partner, best believe I'm showing up at their house and wiping the floor with their face. I would go 100% ZERO contact with them. And if they ever do apologize, don't accept it. That is NOT forgivable. Period. You handled it WAAAAAY better than I would have, so good job for that. And keep a snapshot of that text so if anyone in your family wants to butt in or interfere, you can show them EXACTLY what kind of people they are!", "NTA\n\nYour brother and wife are massive shitheads", "NTA, and your brother's comment was revolting.  Stay away from him.", "[removed]", "wow NTA at all.\n\nbirthday party or not -- your wife clearly was struggling, and you managed the situation with dignity by politely asking them to leave. you two are a team and you did the right thing.\n\nthe fact that SIL was yelling and your brother said those words to you makes me angry and I don't even know you. you don't have to explain or justify how 'careful' you were to anyone. especially someone as incredibly cruel as them\n\ni'm sorry to hear about this. SIL and B should apologize for how they acted towards you two.", "NTA and I personally would blast those AHs so hard on social media that they\u2019d have to change their identities to get away from the shame.    \nI know this may not be good advice and of course your wife may not want her pain to be know but god I am so upset and angry on yours and your wife\u2019s behalf.\n\nEdit to add. I am so impressed with your wife\u2019s and your own grace and poise. You handled the situation incredibly well, which makes me question why they thought announcing at her birthday was a good idea? Or if they had any bad intentions.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t care if it was my brother. Contact would be burned and brother would be getting his ass kicked", "It's because I announce my pregnancy isn't it? Like why would she even say that unless she already knew what was gonna happen, sounds pretty intentional", "Holy shit, NTA.  Your brother and SIL are... this was beyond cruel and were it me I would be absolutely incandescent.", "NTA. I wouldn't talk to them again or have them in my life unless or until they gave your wife and you a heartfelt apology showing they actually understand what they did and why it was so horrible.  If any family members give you grief just send them screenshots of the text your brother sent you, speaks for itself.", "NTA\n\nNeither one of those assholes would ever, ever darken my doorstep again.  I would have had a lot of trouble restraining myself and would cut off all contact.  Neither you, nor your wife, need people that malicious in your lives, fuck all that.", "I will be very disappointed in you if you don't cut contact....\n\nSorry if it sounds harsh or whatever... And you know your family much better of course, but wtf, the clearly did it on purpose. I wouldn't be able to even be in the same room ever again with them.", "NTA. The announcement itself was bad enough, but then they doubled down and blamed y\u2019all for your miscarriage, and I\u2019m honestly just not sure how you come back from that. The announcement issue by itself probably could have eventually been worked through, given enough time and care. But that follow-up was so callous and malicious that I simply don\u2019t see any true resolution. \n\nCurious how your parents are viewing all of this.", "NTA. No way ever are you the bad guy here. That was sincerely cruel, spiteful, nasty, selfish, thoughtless and probably deliberate. It's a long time since I last saw such an obvious NTA here. I can't think of a more horrible thing to do to a woman...at her own birthday party! Your family sucks!", "NTA.  You both need to block your brother and SIL on everything.  Their behavior was go no contact unacceptable.  I can\u2019t believe anyone else there was not horrified by her announcement.  I certainly would have been.", "I just finished my labor and delivery rotation and one of the biggest takeaways from that class (because my professor- a 17 year labor and delivery veteran- drilled it into us) was that the vast majority of miscarriages happen for no reason at all. It's not anything you and your wife did, it's not your wife's body, and barring some underlying, undiagnosed medical issue, it just happens. And it sucks. You mourn your baby but you also mourn an entire future that isn't going to happen and it's terrible. I'm hoping that your brother's comments come from a place of ignorance and possibly fear that it could happen to them. That doesn't excuse anything and you were more gracious about it than you had any reason to be. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  This is so wrong.  Your brother and SIL are King and Queen in AH Land.  It was deliberate and malicious and just plain cruel.  I won't even get into the comment about them not being as careless as the two of you - that is a whole other level.  You were unbelievably gracious in your exit - far better than I would have been.  I'm sure she knows, but make sure your wife understands that it is estimated that 26% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. 10-15% at the stage she was at through NO fault of hers!", "NTA. Her birthday, after loss and the ensuing mental health struggles, is not the appropriate place for a pregnancy announcement.\n\nIt's your brother and SIL that are selfish and the AHs for announcing and then for suggesting it was the result of carelessness. 1 in 4 people will miscarrying and if there's one thing I learned through infertility, we have zero control over this process. I am so mad on the behalf of you and your wife.\n\nI hate when people think pregnancy gives them a free pass from being decent human beings.", "Holy shit, absolutely NTA, especially with that last careless comment. it's absolutely horrid and they were really mean, especially since they knew about the issue and how it affected the OP and wife.\n\nAnd especially on her birthday!!", "NTA! What they did is probably one of the meanest things I've read on here in a while. I couldn't imagine being that cruel to a family member. I would never wish a miscarriage on anyone but damn I hope they get some kinda karma for saying that to you.", " NTA I need to stop being amazed at how thoughtless people are. The lack of self awareness is just awful.", "NTA. It was Anna\u2019s birthday. Your brother and SIL are the selfish ones. And incredibly cruel.", "NTA - you were kinder than they deserved. Even if excited, they should know not to railroad anyone's event (your wife's b'day) into being about them. And then they made it worse by doing at an event where the guest of honour would be hurt for multiple reasons. And then your brother doubled down by DARVIing you - denying the importance, attacking you for being selfish and finally the to me unforgivable trying to blame you for a very sad event that affects like 20% of pregnancies.\n\nEdit: I am so sorry you and your wife had such a sad loss. And as sad, you have such an AH of a brother.", "NTA \nFirst of all I am really sorry about your loss.\nYou handled the situation perfectly given the circumstances.\nApparently your SIL is a real AH for what she did however both of you treated her with incredible grace that not a lot of people in your situation offer.\nOne thing I sure of is that you and Anna will make great parents soon. Wish both all the best.", "NTA. Your brother and his wife are massive AHs. It\u2019s incredibly rude to hijack someone else\u2019s party or event to make a pregnancy announcement, it\u2019s outright cruel to do so at a birthday party where the *guest of honor* has recently suffered a miscarriage. \n\nEven then, you tried to be polite and kind and end the party to comfort your wife without calling them out. The fact SIL blew up at you tells me she knew what she did was messed up and that she and your brother looked like the AHs they were\u2014because if I were there, I definitely would have thought it was tasteless for them to make the announcement instead of waiting. \n\nETA: Your wife was incredibly gracious and kind after the announcement and quietly removed herself without making a scene. My heart aches for her. \n\nIdk if this is right to say, but I would send a firm message telling him off: he and his wife could have waited to make their announcement but selfishly chose to hijack your wife\u2019s party without any regard to she or you might feel. They were cruel, thoughtless, and **careless.** To further double down and attack you for being \u201cjealous\u201d and saying the miscarriage was your guys\u2019 fault is out of line and vile. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss and the reminder of it on your wife\u2019s birthday.", ">*SIL comes walking towards me and starts yelling at me saying that I'm doing this because of her announcement,*\n\nYour SIL immediately making that connection tells me their announcement was deliberate, and meant to hurt.  She and your brother suck.  You're NTA.", "NTA!  That would be the end of them in my life thought, that's for sure.  No way is that ok, and the things they said, hell no!", "NTA that all is bad enough but the careless comment would seal the deal. I had a miscarriage 8 years ago and I've had to work a lot on getting past the idea that it was my fault. These terrible things happen, it's not you and Anna's fault, and to say it was is unthinkably cruel. That should be the last time you see your brother and SIL.", "Omfg. Cut them off. Ntaaaa", "NTA \n\nThere\u2019s a special place in hell for your brother though. \u201cCareless\u201d\u2026 despicable. I wouldn\u2019t tell your wife he\u2019s said this. That could do severe damage even further", "NTA in the slightest.\n\nPutting aside what you and your wife went through, you don't announce pregnancy, engagement, shit like that at someone else's celebration. It's tacky as hell.\n\nNow coming back to what you and your wife went through, your brother and his wife knew damn well that it would be difficult news for the two of you to hear and still decided that the best time to announce it was ON YOUR WIFES BIRTHDAY - they suck, what they did suck, the comments towards you sucked, and I'm genuinely sorry for how they acted", "NTA. They ruined a special time for your wife, apparently didn't notice or care, then seriously insulted you both while claiming you were the selfish one.", "There\u2019s not a snowball\u2019s chance in hell you could be in the wrong NTA. They did it on purpose and you responded with grace and tact. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA! You were trying to be there for your wife, who needed your support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour brother, on the other hand...", "NTA, strongly. You need to tell your parents and anyone else who attended what your brother said, then go no contact with him.", "As everyone has already said, obviously NTA.  But seriously, wtf?  You showed incredible restraint not outright blowing up and publicly calling them out during the party and instead making a polite excuse for everyone to leave. That was rude as hell of them (literally ON HER BIRTHDAY - I agree with some other comments that it feels deliberate) and that text message is just absolutely cruel.", "INFO: Why on earth would you tell your monster of a SIL that you weren\u2019t ending the party because of her disgusting behavior? You need to get way angrier, OP. Stop being polite to and coddling this gaggle of cruel, cruel people.", "NTA \n\nHow dare they be so selfish, self centred and rude.\n\nOn her birthday, at her party.  \n\nWow.", "Your brother and sil deliberately plotted to upset you both and hoped you would react badly so they could spin a story, where you are the bad guys and them the victims. \n\nHow did your family react with their escalation in behaviour?", "Holy shit NTA. \n\nYour brother is a cruel, heartless, nasty husk of a person. I would be going complete NC with he and SIL after that comment. \n\nFirst off, what they did by announcing their pregnancy at your wife\u2019s birthday was so insensitive. \n\nBut that message is the line for me. I couldn\u2019t forgive. \n\nHug your wife, tell her you love her and remind her that you will get through this together. I\u2019m so sorry for both of your loss.", "yeah--that knee-jerk reaction means they knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nshameful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "That was my thought, too.", "Oh yeah, she knew she was being an AH and OP graciously ending the party instead of calling them out made her and the brother look **worse.** I wonder if another guest said something to that effect and SIL felt like she needed to redirect her AH status onto OP instead.", "The timing is just so suspicious to me, especially when they had another big gathering coming up extremely soon.  This doesn't feel like a case of tone deafness.  It feels malicious.", ">, I think that's a clear case of \"fighting words\".\n\nNo, that's a clear case of \"never fucking talk to me again, you're dead to me\" words", "Holy shit NTA and feel free to never-ever- invite them to your home again. They betrayed your trust as hosts, set your wife's progress back knowing your recent loss, and then had the gall to imply it was somehow your fault for losing the pregnancy. \n\nYou were much kinder to your guests than I would have been, and clearly they do not deserve your kindness ever again. I am so sorry, OP. Hug your wife tightly", "Personally I am a level of petty of where I would screenshot that message and send it to everyone and be like we will be taking a break from brother and SIL who have disgusting minds \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife, understandably was upset at the timing. A heads up would have been so kind ....OP's wife may benefit from a few counseling sessions. I will say....I was in the infertility world for many years, as support & info. The one statistic that blew my mind is that a miscarriage with a 1st pg'y is not uncommon. That won't help your wife feel better, but rest assured I am positive neither of you did anything wrong to cause it. And your bro & SIL kinda suck", "If those words came out of my brother mouth, I\u2019d already be on my way to his house to beat wholesale ass.

They deserve it. \ud83d\ude0e", "Yasss act like you\u2019re sorry and it\u2019s all good and then ruin their party by saying you are literally dying in two weeks from an unknown brain tumor and then make sure you both start sobbing right before they cut the cake.", "Send out screenshots during the anniversary party", "THIS, OP.
