He doesn't need to go to therapy for it or work to a particular schedule in order to live his life. He is perfectly happy living his life the way he does and I admire him so much for that. (SUSAGA, I SEE YOU SNOOPING MY COMMENTS, GO GET A TEA AND STAY HYDRATED, I MISS YOU LOTS!)\n\nMeanwhile, I had no idea I was on the spectrum until I was calmly approached by a boyfriend and his mother; the boyfriend was quite high on the spectrum so they both had experience. After hearing their points, I needed to get tested. It consumed my mind that there might finally be a reason for the way I've been my whole life. In my mind at the time, a diagnosis would prove I wasn't \"weird\" \"lazy\" \"dramatic\" \"spoilt\" \"freak\" etc. And when I got diagnosed, the lady who did so told myself and my mother (I wanted her in the room with me because she didn't believe I was on the spectrum) that I was autistic, that I was fairly high on the spectrum, and that she \"was quite frankly shocked that I came across as well adjusted as I did based on the lack of support\" she had found in both my interview and the forms that I and my mother had to fill in before hand.\n\nThat moment will forever stay in my mind as I burst into relieved tears.

I told you that I can't deal with the bright lights, the loud noises, the feeling of labels in my clothes, and the smell of some meals.\n\nSome people need the diagnosis. Some people don't. I needed it. My best friend doesn't.\n\nOnly you can decide whether or not you need it. If you don't think you do, then good for you!\n\nI am curious about how your friend is acting over all of this. Have you straight out asked her what would change if you were diagnosed? Why it's such a big deal to her?\n\nDepending where you are in the world, you could always say you're on a waiting list. Currently in the UK, it takes an average of three years to get an appointment for autism or ADHD diagnosis if you go through the public system (NHS). I personally went private but I know not everyone can do this. So you could tell your friend you're on a waiting list and hopefully she'll stop bringing it up. If she keeps doing it, keep telling her you're on the waiting list.\n\nDrop me a DM if you ever feel like you need to talk to someone regarding things that the world may see as autistic - female autism is quite different from male and it seems to be far more difficult to find others.
