A day pass to a lounge with free alcohol is going to be a bare minimum of about $60.\n\nAirports have marked up prices, but they're not *that* marked up. You can still get a $10 prepackaged sandwich from a news stand / convenience store. Fast food is going to be $20 at an extremely expensive airport (more like $10-15 at most). Even a sit down burger is going to be like $20-30 max.\n\nSo, the only way OP's fictional friends spent more than his lounge pass on airport food is if they were choosing incredibly nice sit down restaurants in the airport and ordering alcohol. Which of course doesn't match their purported motive of traveling as cheaply as possible.\n\nSo either the entire story is fake, or OP lied that his friends spent more than him at the airport to try to make the story sound better.
