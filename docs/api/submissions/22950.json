Especially if you want cocktails - airport cocktails can be like 30 bucks. 2 cocktails and you've paid for your lounge pass.\n\nhowever, maybe don't gloat about the great time you've had when you're with people who had a rough time.  Especially if you've got to travel together. Keep the peace.", "NTA you asked if they wanted to do the same they said no. That's on them.

Like you said, they had access to the exact same stuff you did, they just chose not to use it.", "NTA. You gave them the option, they declined.", "NTA. Your friends first told you to gtfo with your lounge plan! They can't complain later they made a poor choice. \n\nYou're right, the existence of paid lounges is hardly secret.", "It wasn\u2019t a secret.

Maybe next time they will discover the magic of airport lounges for themselves.", "NTA", "They're probably acting like this because they're tired and not thinking straight from the packing, traveling and waiting.

It would have taken you all of 45 seconds to say \u201cbut they have snacks, cocktails, comfy chairs, and showers. We can drink, eat, nap, and shower all for $xxx.\u201d Then you wouldn\u2019t have been an AH. Keeping that info to yourself and then gloating about it to people you call your friends is an AH move. Sure, the internet has that info. So did you, right then, during the conversation.", "ESH, you wouldn\u2019t have been an AH but the comebacks at the end weren\u2019t necessary if they were tired and stressed. You kind of rubbed it in when they were already down. Yes they made the wrong choice but read the room. It\u2019s going to be awkward traveling possibly. \n\nSure they could have and should have done the research and are AH for being mad about not going but sometimes if you don\u2019t know what info your looking for it can be hard to find. Also if they have only used smaller airports, they might have thought it was just a special seating area and not known about all the perks. These are also supposed to be your friends you don\u2019t have to rub it in and they shouldn\u2019t be moody because they made the wrong choice.", "YTA if you didn\u2019t at least explain what was in the lounge for sure.", "YTA for being the friend who ditches regardless. But also yeah if you didn't tell them what was included in the price and just went then YTA anyway. Not everyone (in fact the majority of people) don't have lounge experience because it's expensive and flights etc cost enough already as it is.\n\nIf you'd told them fully, they still said no and then go mad, then you'd be NTA. But I'd still think that travelling as a group means staying with the majority. At least stay sober.\n\nAnd you can get a perfectly good nap in and charge your phone without the lounge and drunk plane passengers are usually extremely annoying, just fyi.", "I have two outcomes for you:\n\nIf the money is shared, then YTA. Plain and simple. You don't spend shared money without talking to the others about it first.\n\nIf the money is yours, then NTA. What makes your friends have the right to think that you spending your own money is something they get to control?", "NTA. Glad you enjoyed your comfy layover", "NTA - it\u2019s not your fault they didn\u2019t know or ask what amenities lounges have. I would also assume someone had a basic understanding of that.", "I woulda been annoyed in your friends place. But I\u2019ve also never traveled so I wouldn\u2019t know it was an option or what it had available. Does that make you an asshole? Kinda yeah kinda no. It would have been nice of you to let them know what was available. \n\nNah", "NTA but I would have tried harder to sell them on the idea if it turned out to actually be cheaper.", "NTA but \u201cthere\u201d", "NTA savvy.", "Surprised their friends shut off the idea even before checking how much the lounge costs lol", "I always see those lounges but I always assumed they were extremely expensive and only for rich people. Never thought about it more.", "It's the smugness for me \"I said that lounges aren't a secret and that the internet exists. They could have looked up the same information I did.\" I'm always excited to share things I think my friends would like.", "This is the one I agree with. I'm such a cheap ass, I always brag about saving money and assume everyone else is as excited about cheaping out as I am. Were I in this situation, I'd probably try to sell my money-saving idea to the group.  \n\n\nThis doesn't bode well for your trip, but OP, I would definitely be letting my friends know my money saving ideas for the rest of the trip. I get being disappointed, but I don't get blaming you for it. Airports are a rip-off any way you slice it.", "the rule about traveling together doesn\u2019t included being uncomfortable cause your friends dont wanna spend money on something that is beneficial", "Strong disagree. Traveling as a group doesn't mean you spend literally every minute together, and none of them were even upset that OP spent time alone; they're only mad that they didn't realize everything the lounge offered. OP told them about the lounge and that they were going to avail themself of it. If they didn't know what that meant, *they could have asked.* \n\nAnd \"at least stay sober\" on a long flight and a layover? Give me a break. If OP is being obnoxious or out of control, that's one thing, but having a few drinks and getting a bit of a buzz isn't a big deal. \n\nNTA, OP.", "Tell me you didn\u2019t read the whole post without telling me.", "WTAF? There is nothing in this post to suggest OP somehow paid for the lounge with \u201cshared money\u201d.", "Right? That's always the first thing; how much does it cost and how long is the layover to make it worth it?", "Some of them are. Some of them are only for rewards member or business/first class. Generally some airlines have ones you can buy a day pass. \nA few major airports have general ones as well that they can buy passes. I\u2019ve done a lot of international travel and still am confused by all the lounges sometimes.", "Ikr. OP isn't an asshole for going to the lounge by himself but not telling his friends about the perks definitely isn't something that friends do.", "They thought they knew better than his money saving tip. This is entirely on them.", "If you travel as a group it's polite to be mindful of the group's budget, else you'll end up making someone feel awkward or like they need to pay extra. As for ditching or staying together, that also depends on the group. Without any extra info it sounds like OP just told them it costs extra, didn't tell them the full benefits, and waltzed off.\n\nAnd I reiterate that you don't need a lounge to have a comfortable layover, even a long one. I've never used a lounge and have never needed to, and I don't skip getting clean either.", "There's a few drinks and getting drunk. OP said they were drunk. Having flown several times due to my degree, work and living far overseas to my family, even slightly drunk passengers are annoying. I'm not against having a pint on a long layover or a glass of wine on the flight. I meant stay sober as in don't get drunk.", "I read the whole post and answered based on my own experiences of extensive long-haul travelling, both alone and in groups of various dynamics.\n\nTell me you make baseless assumptions without telling me.", "That\u2019s it - OP told them all about it and they said no \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "OP said they were \\*a little\\* drunk, which, for a lot of people, means exactly that: a few drinks. \n\nAnd I've flown a LOT more than \"several times,\" and haven't ever had a problem with slightly drunk passengers. Obnoxious passengers are obnoxious whether they're sober or not, but someone who is fine sober is generally fine when they're \"a little drunk\"/Slightly tipsy/a bit buzzed, etc. It's people who get blotto that are the problem."]}
