I had just finished my last beer too recently and I didn't feel 100% sober. \n\n2. The night was still really early and I wasn't ready to turn in yet (it was 7pm, the group only met up at 6 and it was for a friend's birthday).

Our friends are split after she aired it all in the group chat, some saying that since I was the one to put her in a taxi then I should pay up, because I live closeby to her and could've drove her home easily.

She\u2019s the one who got shitfaced. You took reasonable steps to make sure she was safe. She is to blame.", "NTA ofc you can't drink and drive. What on earth is she thinking?\nTell her that next time she can join only if she brings a sober babysitter for herself, if things like this are a problem.", "NTA, she chose to get wasted at 6 pm to the point she couldn\u2019t continue the evening.  That\u2019s all on her. No you don\u2019t owe her money.  She does owe you your sweater. She\u2019s being TA.", "NTA - being the designated driver does not mean you get to ferry everyone around all night. You drive there and you drive back. Your friend sounds happy to ruin your night after she\u2019d already ruined her own. Perhaps it would have been better if you took her home then went home yourself so you could be the one that\u2019s angry about the night? Your friend is an idiot and she brought it on herself. Do not pay for her taxi, she needs to take responsibility for herself.", "NTA\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have to cut your evening short because of her choices. And I\u2019m kind of surprised any of your other friends are taking her side.", "NTA. You had no obligation to drive her home, and couldn\u2019t have anyway since you weren\u2019t sober. Your friends suck for suggesting that you should have driven while drunk. \n\nCalling a cab for someone who is drunk is exactly what you should do in that situation. If you get shitfaced enough not to make decisions for yourself, an $80 cab is a small price to pay.", "NTA. If she was so drunk that she had to be shuffled into a taxi, that's on her.", "NTA \n\nThis is the whole stupid games, stupid prizes, monkeys and circus situation.  \n\nIf she's unable to handle her plonk, it's no-one else's problem.  For those who are siding with her, it looks like they're the ones offering to take her home next time.", "NTA\n\nSo you went tipsy yourself, and you put her in a taxi with enabling a live location so she could reach home safely and went on to your friend's birthday. Plus you gave you sweater to her. Sounds like responsible and a good friend.\n\nOn the other note she got herself drunk within an hour and got you kicked from the club. And she still has the audacity to blame you. Sound like a b.\n\nPs-your friend and those who say you should pay suck.", "NTA, and I'm always glad to hear of people being responsible in these situations.\n\nEven if you hadn't had anything to drink, it sounds like you were the only one who took initiative on anything here. Your drunk friend got you all kicked out of a bar, and given the state SHE got HERSELF in I imagine you'd have risked being turned away from other venues for much the same reason.\n\nIt's also silly how it's seemingly a given that you're suddenly the designated driver despite also being there for a night out. You're not a taxi.\n\nTell her if she doesn't want folk looking out for her and otherwise getting her home safe she shouldn't be getting so drunk that she's being ejected from bars. Within the space of an hour. Fml lmao", "NTA. Do your friends that are siding with her have a different solution to her being so drunk she can\u2019t stand or walk that they\u2019d like to be sure to take responsibility for next time this happens? Because you literally carrying someone for several hours so you can drive them home later sounds like a pretty bad plan all around. And none of them were volunteering to sober up and drive her, I assume.", "NTA. You're not a taxi service, why is it your fault your friend couldn't pace herself and decided to get too drunk to stand up straight? Why should you drive and be gone from your night out for an hour and a half in total just to drive her home when it's her fault anyway? She got irresponsible and had to call it a night early, so it's on her to deal with the consequences of it, not force someone else to cater to them. Plus it's not like it's a small thing; 45 minutes each way is a lot of driving you didn't plan on doing.\n\nEdit: Also the fact that you were driving home means in total you would've been driving for three hours that day if you'd dropped her home and then gone back. So all of your friends were happy to leave her too drunk to walk and happy to leave you driving an extra hour and a half, but now that some don't like with the decision you, the only person who stopped to do anything about it, came to, they're criticising you? Maybe they should've done something instead. You can't do nothing yourself but then call someone selfish.", "NTA. Why is personal responsibility so absent these days?", "NTA. She's the one who got drunk. You didn't force her to drink. Why would she think it's your responsibility to drive her home after she drinks herself silly? If she was drinking more responsibly, driving her home wouldn't have been a problem, right? Because by then, you'd be on your way home too. Why should you ruin your plans to celebrate your friends' birthday because of her?", "NTA\n\nDon't want to end up having to shell out 80$?  Don't get so drunk your friends have to call you a cab.  \n\nGood on you for knowing you were not in a condition to drive.", "NTA. It sucks that it cost her so much money, but it was her own choice to get blind drunk in the first hour of a night out, and you did the right thing by making sure she got home. How was she planning to get home at the end of the night anyway if she was drinking heavily without a DD? My guess is she just assumed you would drive her bc you're not a big drinker, and that's once again her own problem as she should have asked before you guys went out.", "nta -- i can't even believe she's mad at anyone is siding with her. it was her decision to get drunk, having to pay the cab fare home is a potential consequence. the other option would've been for you to drive which puts two lives at risk and i feel like it's a no-brainer here. you don't owe her anything.", "NTA she should not have gotten that drunk that quickly. She apparently was the only one who got that drunk so why is she specifically mad at you? At least you got her a ride home unlike the other group members who didn't even help. She's mad because she's embarrassed and it's perfectly fine that you didn't want to stop the night early for her. If you didn't drink at all you'd still have the right to refuse for that reason alone.", "NTA. Maybe this is harsh, but I have never been able to drive for medical reasons, and in my opinion, part of being an adult is having your own plan for how you will get yourself from Point A to Point B if it's forseeable that you won't be able to drive yourself. Assuming that anyone else will go out of their way for you does not count as a plan. In my case, this often means I pay exorbitant rideshare  prices or spend two hours traveling 10 miles on my city's stupidly designed public transit. But guess what? It's still not anyone else's problem.", "NTA - your friend is a brat. She got you kicked out of a bar an hour into the evening. You aren\u2019t her mom or her babysitter so why should you ruin your night out because she can\u2019t pace herself. As for the friends that jumped to her defense, they left you to deal with her so they can kick rocks.", "NTA\n\nShe drank, she got home (Alive)", "NTA and you definitely shouldn\u2019t pay a dime. Putting a drunk lady in a cab by herself is probably not the best decision, but it seems like she doesn\u2019t even care about that.", "NTA. Her choices, her consequences. You could have left her in the gutter. I\u2019d say most of her anger is from embarrassment. Tell her to keep the sweater and suggest where she can put it.", "I don't thik you're TA because of expenses.. Rather your whole group is to leave her dead drunk alone in a taxi for a 45 min drive.. the shit that could have gone wrong... no party is worth that.", "#nta you don\u2019t have to explain your reasons for not wanting to drive her. At the end of the day she\u2019s an adult. She chose to get  that drunk so early on. Being a good friend doesn\u2019t mean you have to be anyone\u2019s babysitter. You\u2019re friends shouldn\u2019t be picking sides unless any of them had a better solution to this issue. They should stay out of it. As  far as ur friend telling you you owe her money honestly. She can keep the sweater and call it even but also maybe this is a friendship you might want to outgrow.", "NTA. \n\nFour shots of tequila in an hour? \n\nAnd why was she your responsibility? How come the rest of the group are off the hook? She was the one to embarrass you all by getting kicked out of a bat at 7pm.", "NTA as everyone said.\nI hope you can ditch her without being awkward in your group. She brought this on herself, play dumb until she drops it... consider your sweater as gone or ask one of your other friends to \"steal\" it from her.", "NTA. If you don't feel 100% sober, why would you risk it? She should have planned too, about how she's gonna go home if she gets drunk earlier than the rest.", "NTA. She can't handle the consequences of her actions.", "Her conduct led to her being drunk and she needs to rake responsibility for this.\n\nI would simply say she's not your responsibility and you already went over and above by ensuring she was safe. She needs to get a grip and probably learn to moderate her alcohol intake, given that she's the reason the whole group were thrown out.\n\nNta. In any shape or form.", "NTA. You could have just left her on the sidewalk and let her find her own way home. Unless you agreed beforehand that you would drive her home (did you?), you had no obligation to clean up the mess she got herself into.", "NTA.\n\nPeople out here really thinking that drinking and driving is really ok. Your friend got absolutely wasted and the responsibility was put on you to get her home. It shouldn't have been your responsibility but you handled it in the best way possible. Quite frankly, her disregard for her state of being doesn't equate responsibility on your end because you're the most convenient person near her at the time. Lose her number though, she doesn't sound like a good friend.", "NTA. She was the one who chose to be itresponsible, and should be glad somebody made an intervention for her safety at all. Tell her so.", "Is there a possibility your friend was drugged?  4 tequila shots in an hour for a non drinker would probably make them pretty drunk but not to the  point they couldn't even stand.\n\nI was drugged once and this sounds eerily almost identical to what happened to me. \n\nI vote NTA.  You did the right thing, making sure she got home safe in a taxi. You turned location tracking on on her phone to make sure the taxi driver took her straight home.", "NTA\n\nId just send back\n\nYou\u2019re the shit friend for expecting me to drive while intoxicated, which could result in an accident causing injury or death, you\u2019re a shit friend for getting shitfaced straight away and potentially ruining \u2018friends\u2019 birthday and expecting others to carry your slack. And you\u2019re a shit friend for throwing me making sure you get home in the safest way at the time instead of putting myself in danger in my face.   $80 is nothing compared to what would need to be paid out if I were caught drink driving or causing injury or death. I like my life very much Thankyou\n\nIf this is what friendship entails with you, I don\u2019t want that. \n\n\nYou did well.\nI don\u2019t even drink one and drive (it\u2019s legal, just my preference not to) you do you, and ignore the ones that say you have to pay. They didn\u2019t seem too concerned about your friend when she was falling over drunk, so why should they care now.", "NTA- I didn't even need to read beyond #1. I refuse to drink if I know I have to drive, because I have an unreliable tolerance. You didn't feel 100% safe to drive at that time, so you did the safest thing by waiting. You did something nice for your friend to make sure she got home safely. Buy yourself a new sweater and tell your \"friend\" to fuck off.", "NTA your other friends who did not bother handling her and kept partying and now criticize you for handling it can pay for the cab. What do they all want ? That you do nothing next time ?", "NTA. Your friend could've avoided that $80 cost by being responsible and not getting shitfaced within the first hour of being out. If she had a better plan on how to get home, she should've utilized it. You are not her babysitter, and it was not your responsibility. Driving her home wasnt feasible as it meant you would have missed the birthday celebration. Why should you have to miss out because she is irresponsible? She was not your date.  What makes you any more responsible for her than the rest of the group? Did any of them volunteer to drive her home?", "NTA for not driving her and not paying, and your friends shouldn\u2019t be hassling you either because they didn\u2019t do a damn thing to help. \n\nI do have something else to say on the situation, though. \n\nAs crappy as it is for other members of the group, someone should have accompanied her home. Yes, it is correct that it\u2019s her responsibility to not get that drunk and look after herself but most of us will, in our lifetimes, do something silly that requires our friends to look after us. If it\u2019s a pattern then it\u2019s time to talk to someone and set boundaries, but when it\u2019s a one off or occasional thing, I think looking after someone is paramount.\n\nLoading a fall down drunk woman into a taxi for such a long ride whether or not you were keeping track on her phone is dangerous. And sure, people can take the rigid view that her choice her responsibility, but I\u2019d rather ensure a friend isn\u2019t harmed than have some moral high ground. This was not solely your responsibility just because you weren\u2019t drinking much and were driving; it was the whole group\u2019s responsibility. You did a better job than the rest of them who just trotted off to the next bar.", "im kinda split too. i feel like nta because you couldn't have known it was gonna be so expensive, you gave her your sweater like clearly you were trying to care. it's not your responsibility to get her home and she could not have stayed around any longer to wait. you didn't force her to get that drunk. it sucks for her but she is also super over reacting and she's trying to take advantage of you do not give her any money", "You did the responsible thing, she the irresponsible. \nNTA\u2026 \nbut\u2026 why did you take responsibility for her? if she\u2019s not your bff, consult the group what to do with her so you don\u2019t feel conflicted next time something like this happens. Then she either learns or gets pissed at the group and stays away. Her choice \ud83d\ude43", "Just 4 shots.?", "ESH.  She should not have gotten so drunk she could barely stand and how would she have gotten home later anyway? The money is her responsibility. \nHowever everyone leaving a very drunk girl in a cab alone for 45 minutes was not safe. Regardless of a friends stupid choices, I'd still want them safe and not vulnerable and alone.", "I get that you didn't want to drive after drinking, but please just don't drink if you are the one driving, it's a lot more safe. I understand both sides, yes it was early but you were the DD so it's kind of on you to drive amd just putting a very drunk women in a taxi alone is not the best idea, things can happen very easy. But at least you took care of it and didn't just take her to the next location and letting her get even more drunk. After all it was her descition to get that drunk and i get that you didn't want to drive home but i also see why she could be a little annoyed because it's q lot of money and i belive she thought you were the one driving doyou would drive her. But her reaction is very over the top \n\nEdit: NAH", "YTA, based on what you said, did she maybe go too fast. Yes. It is also possible her drink got messed with, and you abandoned her. If you were DD, you shouldn't have been drinking either. You let your friend down in their time if need, you are lucky they are out only 80 bucks.", "YTA don't drink if you need to drive. Then you put a drunk woman, alone, in a cab and hoped it worked out well. \n\nIt sucks when friends get too drunk but if you're an actual friend you will look after them, instead of dumping them because thats more convenient to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There wasn't a DD in this case, but that doesn't change my point since you keep saying that OP should pay the DD if there was one when there'd be no need.

Choices have consequences. \n\nNote: I wouldn't have left her alone as I've stated.
