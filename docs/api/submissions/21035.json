Good on you for being a stellar husband.", "NTA not all heros wear capes. Some drive tractors!", "NTA.....Goes to show what the MIL, and the rest of the family actually think of you. Goes to also show how the MIL, has no sense of humour, and thinks she can still control her daughters life. You did your self and your wife a favour, and also let the MIL, know that when she's in your house, she's just a guest, and she crossed a boundary when it comes to being a guest.

The majority American attitude toward the relationship between parents and children gets a lot of flack, but it teaches a very important lesson:  Nobody gets to treat anybody else with contempt merely because of their relationship.

They still don't get to treat you with contempt and then maintain their relationship with you.

Honestly, that was the only clue that English might not be your first language.
