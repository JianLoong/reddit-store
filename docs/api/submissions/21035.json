Goes to also show how the MIL, has no sense of humour, and thinks she can still control her daughters life. You did your self and your wife a favour, and also let the MIL, know that when she's in your house, she's just a guest, and she crossed a boundary when it comes to being a guest.

We are usually low contact but since the baby was born we wanted to keep up with traditions and since my mom isn\u2019t a Muslim she can\u2019t really help so our hands were forced", "Someone should inform your MIL that \"stupid farmers\" are the reason she has food on her table every day. Thank you for all that you do.", "I hope you consider your hands unforced. Your child deserves a safe space with a solid team around him. Sounds like you and your wife are just that."]}
