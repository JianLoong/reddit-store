We live together and have my son 50% of the time and his daughter every other weekend as she lives out of town. We both forgot it was a public holiday this Monday which meant we would have his daughter Sunday night when usually we would not.\n\nMy 3 friends and I made plans for Sunday night that were important to me and them, 3 weeks prior. I would not have my son, and his daughter would be back at her house with her mum, so I would be free to make plans (so I thought). It was only a dinner, but its very difficult for the 4 of us to get together alone, hence why it was planned so far in advance.\n\nSunday morning, my bf wakes up ill: a stomach bug. He stayed in bed all day while I looked after both kids. I made sure he was left alone so he could sleep. Mid afternoon I asked if he would be well enough to look after his daughter that night, as I was taking my son back to his Dads, and i wouldn't be home. He initially says yes, but then later on he makes it pretty clear he is very unwell and its likely gastro.\n\nI suggested he organise for his daughter to go home then, as a) its friggin contagious and b) if its gastro he'd still be out for the count Monday and I'd be on duty to take care of her while I work (I WFH and don't get the day off), and likely have to drive her to her mum on Monday. I even offered to drive her back the whole way on Sunday afternoon instead of her mum needing to come meet us halfway as she usually does.\n\nHe is angry that I would suggest that, as his time with her is extremely limited as it is since the mother moved out of town with his daughter. He said he might be feeling okay Monday and then still get to spend the day with her and didn't want to risk losing that day with her, which I do understand. But there was an expectation from him that I cancel my plans and stay to look after her because he is sick and needed my help.\n\nI offered him an alternative - if he's too sick to take care of her, I will take her home so you don't have to, and so I can keep my plans. We had an argument, I said (quite angrily) that his daughter isn't my responsibility, and so I left and went to my dinner. He was angry, I was angry. We absolutely do not see eye to eye on this. If I were in dire straights and he had plans, I'd organise for my sons father to have him as i wouldnt EXPECT my partner to take responsibility here, but it is different as I see my son whenever I want and have him far more often. Losing a day here and there isn't a big deal for me like it is for my bf, and he expected me - as his partner - to cancel my plans and take care of his daughter so he could have more time with her.\n\nAITA for feeling like I shouldn't be expected to sacrifice my plans I made 3 weeks earlier that were important to me, and stay home and look after his daughter/help him instead?", "created_utc": 1675656113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ux1bx/aita_because_i_didnt_babysit_my_boyfriends/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You planned this three whole weeks in advance too. why would u be the AH for just this once suggesting someone else pick up the work? NTA", "NTA... For what it's worth I think your offer to take her home early was the right call. I probably would have said the same thing.", " NTA. He\u2019s sick. Why would he want her anywhere near him if he could avoid it? \n\nIt sounds bad to say \u201cI have plans with my friends, why would I watch a kid instead?\u201d But the circumstances say that the kid should be away to stay safe. Also, he\u2019s your bf, not your fianc\u00e9 or husband. A step mother could be expected to care for her step children. Even then, with sickness in the house? Not if it can be avoided.\n\nThe question is what\u2019s best for the kid. Not getting sick sounds best to me.", "NTA on the whole.   Telling him you would take her back home to her mom absolved you from being the AH. But..... telling him that his daughter isn't your responsibility was an AH thing to say, or feel.  You guys are together and he's going to expect you to treat his daughter as your own if you're going to move forward, just like I'm sure you should feel about him with your son.", "NTA, I\u2019m with you here. You are partners but you are not his daughter\u2019s parent. I\u2019m sure her mom would have appreciated the offer for you to bring her home and minimize the possibility of her getting sick. \n\nDoes your bf have a complex about not letting his ex \u201cwin\u201d? It seems like he didn\u2019t want to admit \u201cdefeat\u201d by letting his ex have more time with their daughter even though he was in absolutely no shape to care for her.", "NTA he wants to cancel your plans to take care of his daughter isntead of him so he can spend time with her but he won't be able to spend time with her because he's sick! He cant be serious lol", "Edit due to answer received: I think on a whole, NTA. You did try to find different solutions and it doesn\u2019t seem that you help with parenting decisions. I do think that you should probably figure out what role you actually want to play in her life though, because it seems you and your bf have different thoughts on this and you\u2019re already living together. I do think that once you\u2019re living with someone, you really do carry more responsibility than when you live separately. And, I think you owe your bf an apology for how you responded to him, because it doesn\u2019t sound like it was said very nicely. \n\nInfo: do you consider yourself your bf\u2019s daughter\u2019s step mom? Do you help make parenting decisions? \n\nThis is a tough situation. If you\u2019re considering yourself part of the parenting team, then I think sometimes your plans should be canceled, as should some of his plans. It stinks, sure, but it\u2019s part of being a parent. Considering you live together, it makes me think there\u2019s some amount of parenting being done. If you\u2019re not part of the parenting team, then fine, it\u2019s not your responsibility.", "NTA. You offered to drive her home.", "NTA - and if it\u2019s gastro his daughter could catch it.", "ESH\n\nYTA because: You two live with each other. You are a family unit regardless of which kids are there or not. It would be different if you were roommates, but you\u2019re not. You seem to see you and your son as one family and your partner and his daughter as a separate one. \n\nIn a family you help each other out. And yes you had made plans a long time ago but your partner didn\u2019t try to get sick and neither of you realized there was no school. So you suck it up and pitch in. \n\nHe\u2019s the AHole because he is sick and yet wants his child to remain there and possibly catch it. He also expects her to just hang around on the off chance he\u2019s better so he can spend time with her. That\u2019s caring about himself and not what\u2019s best for the child.\n\nThe right thing to do would have been to call the mom and see if the child can go home early (she might also have plans and as this is his weekend it\u2019s his responsibility to find coverage) and if not, then you take care of the child until he is well, or until she\u2019s able to go home to her mom.", "Was he well enough on Monday to spend time with his daughter? How did he handle being sick and caring for his daughter before you came along?. You and your boyfriend need to sit down and discuss the parenting work and boundaries in this relationship. How does his ex feel about you caring for her child and/or making decisions about her child when she is with you. This also needs to be a factor in the discussions because she can make life difficult if she feels you are stepping on her parenting. All the adults need to be on the same page and communication is how you get there.", "NTA for saying if he was sick she could go back to mom. However, saying you\u2019re not responsible for the child is an AH move. If you see a future with this guy she is going to be your responsibility too. I couldn\u2019t imagine telling my husband my stepkids aren\u2019t my responsibility! Once things calm down you guys need to talk and work things out to have a plan in the future.", "NTA.\n\nEspecially since you offered to drive her home. He\u2019s sick - it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to be able to spend that time with her.", "NTA because OP you were putting his child's health first, he was putting his ego first.  It's a toss up whether or not he would have been better on Monday, and if he wasn't and she got sick then his ex would have lit into him.  He can see about getting that \"extra day\" possibly later on, but shit happens and he needs to just get over it.", "NTA, but I don't get why he doesn't just take care of his daughter on his own whether he's sick or not. I'm a single mother and if I have gastro I get the joy of taking care of my (currently aged) 6 year old daughter whilst sick and typically cleaning her vomit too", " Nta not your child. If he is so sick he can't take care of his daughter or might make her sick he should arrange a sitter or send her to her mom.  You offered reasonable suggestions. He didn't accept. His daughter his responsibility.", "NTA. He could have hired a babysitter if he needed help.  You are not free child care for him just because you live together (and seems like not even for that long yet). Sounds like you are still too early in the process of blending the families and that is OK. You offered him an option to drive her to her mom's and he didn't take it, that's on him, she is his responsibility like you said.", "NTA. Your logic was sound here and you offered a reasonable compromise.", "NTA \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to cancel your plans for your boyfriends daughter. \n\nYou offered a decent solution of dropping her home early. \n\nHe can find child care. You aren\u2019t his babysitter. And you definitely shouldn\u2019t have to cancel your plans to babysit his kid!", "Taking the story as a whole, you were both shades of ah with him being a bigger one than you.\n\nHim for expecting you to be on call, which is unreasonable if you were married and it was your child- he can suck it up and parent.\n\nYou for the responsibility comment and suggesting he give away parenting time because it wasn't convenient with your schedule.\n\nHopefully you both grow from this one.", "YTA for going out socializing while living in close quarters with someone who you think has a contagious illness.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not involved in any aspect of her life except when she is with us or has a dance recital (once).

I have no excuse for it. Would have been awful if she had heard me say it as well - just wrong all over.", "But he's not single. He does have me to lean on usually, he's angry and let down by me that this time he couldn't. I'm wondering if the concensus is that I'm morally wrong for leaving him last night after he didn't want me to take her to her mother's", "Considering you can only transmit the illness if you have symptoms and 48 hours after symptoms have gone, I wasn't risking getting anybody else sick.\n\nThey were also all aware of his sickness and asked me to come along still.", "NTA!! I would have said the same tbh. He shouldn\u2019t expect something from you just cause he does it, people don\u2019t work that way.

(My daughter just went thru this with her ex - he took her to court and this is what the judge told him)\n\nSo either he takes care of her whilst Ill, you take care of her or he hires a babysitter. \n\nIf mom says \u2018sure\u2019 then great. \n\nIt depends on what kind of relationship you each envision going forward \u2014- and the impact on the children, for whichever you choose.", "Its good that you realize it. Like I said, you guys need to talk things over. Being a stepparent isn\u2019t easy-and I didn\u2019t have any of my own when we got together and it was rough in the beginning. You just have to have patience.", "You should stop stressing this. You have him choices for compromise. There is no saying he would have been better the next day anyway so the idea to take her to mom's was valid. \n\nThe point above is that as a single mom she doesn't have the option of having a partner to take child to the other parents in emergency or to help out. Your SO does. But he doesn't get to abuse that just to make himself feel better as a parent. I am saying this as someone who sacrificed my sanity to help my husband be the best father to my stepdaughter and sacrificed so much of myself to do so. I lost myself because of it. Stand your ground. You did nothing wrong.", "I agree with all ^^^ of the things here. And I absolutely would be in the y t a camp if the girl's mom couldn't take her daughter, and OP still nope-d out of taking care of her SOs kid while he was sick. Yet that didn't happen. So, with the way things actually *did* occur, I respectfully stand by my judgment.", "Right. And he is hurt and angry because he feels he can't lean on me. Which is completely valid, but I also wondered if my stance on this was also valid. So far, I'm still unsure based on your response and then everyone elses. There's points to both arguments, I guess."]}
