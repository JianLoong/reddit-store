They have successfully conceived and are expecting a boy! They are far enough along that they felt comfortable announcing and we are praying that this miracle can make it to term and is healthy. We were not invited to their gender reveal but I was due that week and they currently live 3 hours away so we could not travel. However, the woman my brother cheated on his wife with while on deployment was invited and attended so...... our relationship is still very strained. My SIL posted a reel to FB sharing all the dirty details for friends and family to see. Including screenshots from the conversation she had with the mistress. In some of those screenshots the mistress shared that my brother insisted his wife was dying of cancer (she did receive cancer treatment while he was deployed but wasn't in Stage 3/4. Which is wild because our mom died of cancer a few years ago so we are familiar with how things can progress with cancer.) and he was seeking comfort. Then swore to his wife on our dead mother's grave that he didn't cheat on her. However, shortly afterwards my SIL tested positive for an STD while pregnant. Things are a mess. My heart is breaking for them because he saw how his father's infidelity destroyed our family and I figured he would not to perpetuate that generational trauma. I think, perhaps, all the drama about my pregnancy had less to do with me and more to do with issues they were/are trying to navigate.", "created_utc": 1702687443, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jezvi/update_am_i_the_asshole_for_announcing_our/", "score": 166, "replies": [">however, the woman my brother cheated on his wife with while on deployment was invited and attended so\u2026..\n\n*Record scratch*", "Whoa, that is indeed bittersweet, and kind of weird (mistress at the gender reveal party?)\n\nYou did not pose the AITA question here, but we can make your bro the AH for completeness sake.", "(wince)  \n\n\nYeah, it sounds like they can't bring themselves to deal with their anger and resentments towards each other in a healthy manner, so they are transferring and projecting all of that towards you.    \n\n\nCount it as a blessing, their life is messier than an eighties soap opera.", "So.... your brother made you his personal punching bag while he was being unfaithful. Wow, I'd go LC or NC after that mess.", "Was the mistress invited to the party AFTER the affair was discovered? Cause that's  weird", "Exactly!\nFor the record, the hierarchy is:\nSelect family \nFriends \nCoworkers \nMistress \nThen us \ud83d\ude2c", "Yeah I just stared at the screen there, wondering what I just missed. Even went back to the old post to see if they mentioned a possible affair back then.\n\nThat was shocking.\n\nMakes sense why HE was the only one to lash out there. Can\u2019t believe they\u2019re inviting the person who introduced the STD that\u2019s currently threatening a baby\u2019s life to said baby\u2019s gender reveal. This is terrible", "This.", "I linked the OG post, in which I was voted not the asshole but yeah. \nThe whole situation has serious telenovela vibes.

I hate that it has affected the relationship of me and my SIL, though. I wish I could bridge that gap and support her through this difficult time.", "Yeah. I don't believe anyone is above redeption but I'll definitely be going low contact for a while. I will always love them and want what's best for them but it's not healthy to have that spilling over into our family.", "Invited before. I still can't imagine having the audacity, the gall, the confidence to invite the mistress to the gender reveal.", "They should have done a STD reveal along with the gender reveal in that case with the mistress helping out", "You may be on to something.\n\nSince my mother passed my sister\u2019s behavior\u2026deteriorated I guess is the right word. I\u2019ve since gone no contact, unfortunately.\n\nAnd I hadn\u2019t thought of this in years, but when I was maybe 18 or 19 one of my friends also lost her mom and went completely off the deep end. Just doing things completely out of character.", "What he\u2019s done is still unforgivable, though! Hows his wife doing with all this?", "You can't span a gap you didn't make.  Until and unless she welcomes your advances there's nothing you can do except be patient.", "They\u2019re probably jealous you\u2019re pregnant in a healthy marriage with no messy mistress drama & STD to deal with. Im sure your SIL dreamed of her pregnancy for so long but did not imagine it to go this way!", "Protect your peace especially as so close to your due date!", "That\u2019s wild bruv. Did the mistress know she was the other woman at the gender reveal party? Or did she put him on blast after? I\u2019m confusion\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy"]}
