We were at a game night with six other couples. During her turn to be the judge in Cards Against Humanity, she received a FaceTime call from her male best friend. She put me on the screen and they quickly chatted. She then had the bright idea of asking him to help her select the cards during her turn and threw the phone in my hand telling me to hold it for her. Her two friends didn't seem to care, but the other couple had a strange look on their face like they had seen something they shouldn't have. She and her friend played her turn, we all laughed, and she said \"I love you\" to him before ending the call. \n\nAfter the game night, I told my girlfriend that her behavior made me feel uncomfortable and disrespected in front of strangers. I'm not asking her to give up her relationship with him or to stop saying \"I love you\" to him, but I'm asking her to not announce it in front of strangers, especially when it makes me feel uncomfortable. I also feel uncomfortable about the flirty wave my girlfriend gave her male best friend on FaceTime. While I understand that they have a close relationship, I think doing something like that in front of me and strangers is inappropriate.\n\nThis incident made me realize that this is a double standard in our relationship. For example,  My girlfriend and I went on two gym dates, and during each visit, we bumped into a woman I used to date. After a the second time, my girlfriend asked me to choose another gym, and even though I didn't like it, I agreed because I wanted to make her feel comfortable. I feel that this situation is similar to the one at the game night, where my girlfriend needs to understand that her actions can make me feel disrespected, and she needs to adjust her behavior accordingly. Her response is that its different because her and her best friend have  never been intimate, dated or even kissed... All of which I'm skeptical of but whatever.\n\nSo, am I being too sensitive or is my girlfriend in the wrong for her behavior? I would really appreciate your thoughts and opinions on this. Thanks, guys!\n\nTLDR: AITA for feeling disrespected by my girlfriend's behavior at a game night, where she announced \"I love you\" to her male best friend in front of strangers.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m 36M and she is 32F.", "created_utc": 1682173567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v7ht4/aita_did_my_girlfriends_actions_at_game_night/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Double standards aren't cool. Good for you for honoring her wishes with the gym, even if they seemed a little ridiculous. Bad on her for not giving you the same courtesy when you brought up the phone call.

Idk if she asked first which would've been fine. I don't know how casual ya'lls dynamic are as a friend group.\n\nHOWEVER, upon realizing that ya'll have some double standards, I think that's something to generally talk about how you feel about expressing affection and how you interpret it in order not project insecurities onto a each other.\n\nWhy are you insecure about your partner saying \"I love you\" to her best friend? I think this is a value difference in how people express affection to one another.\n\nThe same with your partner \"why change gyms who is an ex\" in her insecurity? Why change a gym for an ex. Unless that ex is problematic, then I don't personally see how this is a good reason.\n\nPeople can say \"I love you to friends\" regardless of sex, and people can still be friends or have a cordial relationship with some who is your ex. What are ya'll assuming about each other?\n\nSounds like ya'll got a few insecurity/ trust issues to find ways to work through as a couple in order to better understand one another.", "NTA and cheaters are often the most paranoid and controlling about their ostensible partner's behavior - the fact that she's simultaneously being weird about you being around women and being flirty and saying I love you to another guy, in front of other people, is a red flag.  If the friend is not gay, I'd put $20 on the fact that either they've slept together previously, or will shortly after you break up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
