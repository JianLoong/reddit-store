His hair color, eye color, shape of his nose, the way his ears stick out a little bit. Yeah, that apparently all came from her and her side of the family. If I take claim to anything she either ignores me, or tells me how im wrong.\n\nI was thinking of getting a DNA test for my son so that we wouldn't have to buy two separate tests for my husband and I, but I was also considering just getting the two tests so that we would have a definite answer as to what my side holds and what his does. There's one heritage we definitely don't share. I'm half Mexican. He's white basically.\n\nI tell my Mil and also I tell her how if we just get one for my son, there's things that are obviously going to be from my family, but i kinda wanna know the percentages for the things that overlap.\n\nMy very much white MIL told me to not be so sure about where my son would get his Mexican genes from because she thinks she found something recently in her family history that leads to her having Mexican genes too. Or something like that. I was too angry to really listen. \n\nI get claiming the other things, but to now claim a heritage that isn't hers?! My grandfather taught me about his culture and I took it in as my heritage. Its a part of me that I'm proud of even if I get sh*t from some people when I tell them.\n\nFor her to try to claim it was the last straw. I blew up at her. I really don't yell at people. She went completely silent as I yelled at her.\n\nI told her how sick and tired I was of her trying to erase my involvement in MY son. That her trying to take claim to a heritage that she knows absolutely nothing about was my final straw. I no longer want to hear a word out of her mouth about what my son looks like unless it's just to call him adorable. I no longer want to hear her pick specific things out about him. I told her that if she continues to do so, then she's not allowed to see my son until I say so. I finished yelling at her and my husband stepped in and talked to her in a stern voice.\n\nHe told he what she didn't wasn't right and that he agrees with me. Including the part about her not seeing our son if she does it again. He also told he how he's wanted to have a talk with her about this for a while, but how I told him not to since I really hate conflict.\n\nShe was silent for a moment, with a surprised look on her face. Then the crocodile tears started and she just sobbed and said that she didn't mean anything by it and how could I be so cruel as to yell at her about something so small. Then she called me an asshole and left. \n\nSince then, a couple people from her family have sent me messages calling me an asshole for being rude to her. I'm like 98% sure that they don't know the actual story and when I did explain it to one person, they still said I was an asshole for blowing up at her over something small.\n\nIs this a small issue? Was I really the asshole for yelling at her?\n\nEdit: Okay, so maybe it was a little dumb of me to not put exactly what my MIL said that upset me because of the character limit. Instead I just put context. \n\nShe said \"If the Mexican gene pops up it definitely wouldn't be because of you.\" And then she went on to talk about some very distant relative that may or may not exist. \n\nShe has said similar things about what he looks like, \"this feature definitely didn't come from you because (her or some relative of hers) has it\"\n\nEdit #2: I know that \"Mexican genes\" aren't a thing. That side of my family will trace back to a couple of different things. \n\nI do not want to get a test specifically because of MIL, I just enjoy genealogy because I love history\n\nI have made small comments to MIL before to try to get her to stop pointing it out all the time. And by all the time I mean ALL the time. Any time I post a pic there's a comment from her about just how much she looks like her side of the family. She sees him in person, and she would continuously talk about it and would barely talk about anything else her entire visit.\n\nI absolutely do not care who exactly my son looks like. He can look exactly like my husband for all I care, I married him for a reason. My son is adorable and healthy and that's all I care about.\n\nFIL and MIL are divorced and he rolls his eyes every time he's around when she does this because my husband looks exactly like him.\n\nUPDATE! Okay I really wasn't expecting to update but my MIL called me. I was really hoping she was calling to apologize in order to make peace or something but omg. Apparently my husband had called her on his lunch break in order to try to have a peaceful conversation. I called him when my call with MIL was done and he told me their conversation. \n\nHusband: Mom we need to talk about how you talk about (me) when it comes to our son. Why do you continuously brush her off?\n\nMIL: What I'm not allowed to point out that he looks nothing like her? He's honestly too cute to be related to her. He looks nothing like a Mexican, so are you even sure that he's her son? Did you guys get a egg donor without telling me?\n\nHusband: (sits in silence for a moment) Did you really just say that?! WTF mom?!\n\nMIL: I was just asking. There's no need for you to be rude about it. \n\nHusband: You just told me that you don't even think my son with my wife is even related to her! \n\nMIL: Well how else would it explain why he looks nothing like her?\n\nHusband: He does look like her! At least a little bit, but you refuse to see it! I can't talk to you about this right now. I have to go back to work and I need to calm down.\n\nNot long after, she called me\n\nMe: Hello MIL\n\nMIL: You b****. My son is now mad at me because of you!\n\nMe: If you're talking about yesterday, yes he's mad at you. We both are. But if it means anything, I'm sorry for yelling at you. I'm just so tired of your side comments. It really feels like you're brushing off my involvement with my own son. It was just so frustrating. \n\nMIL: Like that's really your son. \n\nMe: WTF do you mean by that?\n\nMIlL: My son probably lied to me because you put him up to it! You got an egg donor didn't you! He's adorable and doesn't look Mexican at all! I'm tired of your lies! He's not your son!\n\nMe: What! First off, Mexicans can look like anything! I've seen a pale skin, ginger Mexican! Second off, I always figured you were a bit narcissistic but I didn't think you were insane! \n\nMIL: I'm not insane! You're trying to pass off a baby that's not yours! My son needs to leave you and take HIS baby with him!\n\nThen she hung up. I was reeling from that, so I called my husband, who proceeded to tell me about their conversation.\n\nI'm still freaking reeling. Sure, she's always been a pain and has had her JNMIL moments, but this is the first time she's been full on insane. Now shes definitely not coming around my son until she gets some help.", "created_utc": 1694589041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hg6f0/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mil_when_she_tried_to/", "score": 2087, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's minimising your contribution to your son in order to maximise her own.\n\nJust a heads up on the DNA test thing. I did mine with Ancestry and about a year ago they introduced a thing where it divides your genes by parent. So Parent 1 is genetically from A, B and C, and Parent 2 is from B, D and E style. Not sure if the others do it, but that would be a good way to put your foot down. \n\nMy paternal nan tried to tell me that my Scottish ancestry comes from her and she wouldn't hear that my maternal nan was *literally Scottish*. After it divided it by parent it was pretty hard to argue with one parent being 78% Scottish and the other being 6%.

You are NTA for getting upset with her.\n\nBut I noted that your husband was ready to talk to HIS mom about her behavior; but you didn't want him to because you hate conflict. Just see where your conflict avoidance got you.\n\nWhen this first became a sore spot, you could have allowed your husband to talk to his mom early enough for it to be a calm conversation and for you and husband to enforce the boundaries HE told his mom would be put in place if she persisted. The message would have come from her own son. It would have been delivered in a more calm manner. Instead, you didn't let him handle his mom; you kept things bottled up until it erupted out of you; and now his mom/relatives are blaming you.

Let your husband speak up to and manage relations with his own family.\n2. Don't think that you will actually avoid conflict by not speaking up/letting him speak up. Either you will let it eat away at your insides and/or you will erupt in conflict-creating manner. Much better to learn to speak up sooner.\n3.

There are things you can do in your own mind and heart that would take any power out of her weird need to be the sole source of your son's existence. (Like for one, it's really hard to take her seriously. You could do the tests because it would be fun to know, and you could decide whether to tell her the facts or not. You might have even made a game of her making claims. I'm not saying you had to do anything specific; but you have a power to recognize the absurdity of her claims and render them unable to impact/hurt you. It's something you may want to try in the future.\n\nSo get those tests; enjoy seeing how you and your husband are reflected in your son.

I always wanted to scream at the tv that in the early modern period, especially the 30 years war there were a huge number of Scottish mercenaries in what is now Germany. After they decided to get out of that business, a lot of those people settled down and over time their descendants ended up culturally German. I can\u2019t say for sure that this was the case with that guy, but I can completely see how people might take this new genetic information and feel like it represents more than the cultural element. It\u2019s definitely part of the story and is cool to know, but I just find it kinda tragic that people have a tendency to view genetics as more real just because it\u2019s a hard record inside us.

What isn't really common knowledge is that the 50% you get from each parent isn't necessarily an even split between each grandparent due to random recombination.\n\nJust as an easy example with rounded numbers: of the 50% Mom you get, while you may expect that to be 25% of each grandparent, it may actually be more like a 22/28 split, with more grandpa than grandma. Not a whoooole lot is lost, but compounded across several generations, you will end up inheriting ZERO DNA from a large number of your ancestors beyond about five generations or so.\n\nAll this to say, the older the generation you can test, the further back in time you can find shared DNA with ancestors. Your son likely won't share DNA with a good chunk of your more distant family that you would share DNA with.\n\nAnother thing to mention: siblings get DIFFERENT DNA from their parents! Obviously *most* of it will be similar, but it is completely normal for full-blooded siblings (not twins tho) to have some different matches at the fringes, different percentages in their breakdown, and share slightly differing amounts of DNA with close family.\n\nSo, just food for thought. There is some really cool science going on behind the scenes, and I'll admit the historical aspect can definitely be interesting, but it's still not something I can really recommend.\n\nAnd holy fuck do some people make DNA percentages their whole identity when that is unequivocally NOT how that works at all, please don't be like that", "NTA.
