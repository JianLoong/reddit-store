His hair color, eye color, shape of his nose, the way his ears stick out a little bit. Yeah, that apparently all came from her and her side of the family. If I take claim to anything she either ignores me, or tells me how im wrong.\n\nI was thinking of getting a DNA test for my son so that we wouldn't have to buy two separate tests for my husband and I, but I was also considering just getting the two tests so that we would have a definite answer as to what my side holds and what his does. There's one heritage we definitely don't share. I'm half Mexican. He's white basically.\n\nI tell my Mil and also I tell her how if we just get one for my son, there's things that are obviously going to be from my family, but i kinda wanna know the percentages for the things that overlap.\n\nMy very much white MIL told me to not be so sure about where my son would get his Mexican genes from because she thinks she found something recently in her family history that leads to her having Mexican genes too. Or something like that. I was too angry to really listen. \n\nI get claiming the other things, but to now claim a heritage that isn't hers?! My grandfather taught me about his culture and I took it in as my heritage. Its a part of me that I'm proud of even if I get sh*t from some people when I tell them.\n\nFor her to try to claim it was the last straw. I blew up at her. I really don't yell at people. She went completely silent as I yelled at her.\n\nI told her how sick and tired I was of her trying to erase my involvement in MY son. That her trying to take claim to a heritage that she knows absolutely nothing about was my final straw. I no longer want to hear a word out of her mouth about what my son looks like unless it's just to call him adorable. I no longer want to hear her pick specific things out about him. I told her that if she continues to do so, then she's not allowed to see my son until I say so. I finished yelling at her and my husband stepped in and talked to her in a stern voice.\n\nHe told he what she didn't wasn't right and that he agrees with me. Including the part about her not seeing our son if she does it again. He also told he how he's wanted to have a talk with her about this for a while, but how I told him not to since I really hate conflict.\n\nShe was silent for a moment, with a surprised look on her face. Then the crocodile tears started and she just sobbed and said that she didn't mean anything by it and how could I be so cruel as to yell at her about something so small. Then she called me an asshole and left. \n\nSince then, a couple people from her family have sent me messages calling me an asshole for being rude to her. I'm like 98% sure that they don't know the actual story and when I did explain it to one person, they still said I was an asshole for blowing up at her over something small.\n\nIs this a small issue? Was I really the asshole for yelling at her?\n\nEdit: Okay, so maybe it was a little dumb of me to not put exactly what my MIL said that upset me because of the character limit. Instead I just put context. \n\nShe said \"If the Mexican gene pops up it definitely wouldn't be because of you.\" And then she went on to talk about some very distant relative that may or may not exist. \n\nShe has said similar things about what he looks like, \"this feature definitely didn't come from you because (her or some relative of hers) has it\"", "created_utc": 1694589041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hg6f0/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mil_when_she_tried_to/", "score": 793, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's minimising your contribution to your son in order to maximise her own.\n\nJust a heads up on the DNA test thing. I did mine with Ancestry and about a year ago they introduced a thing where it divides your genes by parent. So Parent 1 is genetically from A, B and C, and Parent 2 is from B, D and E style. Not sure if the others do it, but that would be a good way to put your foot down. \n\nMy paternal nan tried to tell me that my Scottish ancestry comes from her and she wouldn't hear that my maternal nan was *literally Scottish*. After it divided it by parent it was pretty hard to argue with one parent being 78% Scottish and the other being 6%. (Fun fact, the family came from a remote area so Ancestry literally named the county my mother's family is from)\n\nETA: changed a word", "NTA. This isn't a one off event. It's not something small. She's been doing this for a long time. I think she's just not used to people answering her back.", "NTA. Sounds like she needed to be put in her place and you did exactly that, especially seeing as your husband agreed and supported it. I agree with you 100% that these people probably have no idea what the true story is. If you haven\u2019t confronted her on this at all in any way then jumped to yelling at her is probably a little overkill but i absolutely understand where it was coming from and dont think you did anything wrong per se but possibly could have been handled a little better. Overall not the asshole though", "NTA. Get the test done, they're fun. And Ancestry will tell you which matches come from BOTH parents lol. I did that one and 23&me. Fun watching it update periodically and more. Any haters just know her side. She was rude first and you were tired of her BS.", "NTA\n\nThat being said, your issues with your mother in law are not about your son, she is literaly just trying to erase you from existing within the family, she has an issue with YOU. To the point she does not even want to acknowledge your genes exist in your own son you concieved and birthed she literaly believes all of your genetics are inferior to hers and so her genetics are natrually the only dominant ones.\n\nNo genetic test is ever going to resolve those issues. You could literaly have her take a test that says she has 0 mexican have your son take one saying he geneticaly is half mexican (saying he took allo of your mexican genes) and she would still argue that none of your genes are dominant and showing in him.", "NTA\n\nYou guys need some distance.

MIL kept on claiming he looked like his dad and wouldn't hear anyone contradict her, even her own son.  Our mom heard her make that claim and decided to set a trap for MIL at my nephew's first birthday.  Mom found a picture of my sister from her first birthday and set it out for MIL to find.  She did and said \"I haven't seen this picture of my grandson before!  Who is that strange woman with him?  I don't recognize her.\"  Mom came up looked at that picture and said \"Oh, that's *me, with my daughter, your DIL,* at her first birthday party.  How you missed the 1979 fashion and decor is beyond me!\"  Never heard another peep about nephew taking after only his father after that.\n\nIf your son looks like you or similar to you when you were that age, you might want to dig up a photo of you from around that time and see if your MIL falls into the same trap.", "NTA - you don't need to get a DNA test though unless you want to.

You're on time out too; maybe YOU  can think about how YOU treat people.\" then block them... every. Single. One. Unblock after a week or a month or whatever.... and keep repeating until they understand that you will not tolerate that bullshit. \n\nAlso start reading on negative traits passed thru the fathers genetics and point it out.... not in a way that HE will feel shitty just use it to dump on HER bullshit strategically. \n\nIe: had an acquaintance dog on her husband's genes very rudely... kiddo was autistic and she was like \"mUsT get iT fRoM HiM\"....I stopped her RIGHT there....\"ACTUALLY intelligence is carried by the mothers genes AND autism is inherently a female carried genetic trait so maybe you should look at YOUR carrier genes\"\n\nAnd lastly.....DNA test all 3 of you.... with 23&me.... they have far more comprehensive and detailed areas of the world that they match too. If you want to start ancestry tracking you'll have to get one from ancestry. Com ALSO since the DNA profile doesn't transfer BUT ancestry. Com isn't as detailed or comprehensive and is missing information tbh....ie my great grandfather immigrated directly from Italy, I can track him thru immigration documents and manifests from the boats over. Along with marriage and birth/ death tracking. 23&me says I'm 12.8%Italian from the exact commune he came from. But ancestry. Com states in only 8% Italian. That's incorrect.

You are NTA for getting upset with her.\n\nBut I noted that your husband was ready to talk to HIS mom about her behavior; but you didn't want him to because you hate conflict. Just see where your conflict avoidance got you.\n\nWhen this first became a sore spot, you could have allowed your husband to talk to his mom early enough for it to be a calm conversation and for you and husband to enforce the boundaries HE told his mom would be put in place if she persisted. The message would have come from her own son. It would have been delivered in a more calm manner. Instead, you didn't let him handle his mom; you kept things bottled up until it erupted out of you; and now his mom/relatives are blaming you. (They just gloss over the fact the your husband also spoke and supported your position.)\n\nSo please get 2-3 lessons from this:\n\n1. Let your husband speak up to and manage relations with his own family.\n2. Don't think that you will actually avoid conflict by not speaking up/letting him speak up. Either you will let it eat away at your insides and/or you will erupt in conflict-creating manner. Much better to learn to speak up sooner.\n3. OK, your MIL was both weird and way over-the-top in claiming credit for everything about your son. She needed to be talked to. But I also think some part of you knows that she was full of it. There are things you can do in your own mind and heart that would take any power out of her weird need to be the sole source of your son's existence. (Like for one, it's really hard to take her seriously. You could do the tests because it would be fun to know, and you could decide whether to tell her the facts or not. You might have even made a game of her making claims. I'm not saying you had to do anything specific; but you have a power to recognize the absurdity of her claims and render them unable to impact/hurt you. It's something you may want to try in the future.\n\nSo get those tests; enjoy seeing how you and your husband are reflected in your son. (I've been interested in doing that in may family because we have such diverse backgrounds but still share some attributes.) Then let your husband be the one to deal with his family. But also learn to speak up for yourself in general. And just enjoy your son!", "NTA.\n\nShe weaponized what is a light, fun and normal conversation in normal families, and she knows it.

I have three children and each takes after their Dads side in looks.  One son\u2019s childhood photos are interchangeable with his Dad\u2019s, but personality wise he is far more like me.\n\nYour mother in law\u2019s behaviour is cruel, a DNA test will not change that.  And it does not change the fact that your son\u2019s DNA comes from both his parents, he received chromosomes from both of you.\n\nShe is trying to stake a claim on your child\u2019s heritage.  The fact that she started saying there is Mexican blood on her side of the family after you brought up a DNA test, may be indicative of an affair and bringing her or your husband\u2019s father into question.\n\nBut be aware that DNA tests like the Ancestry one are not 100%.

It was a commercial so I have no idea how much of anything was true but I still remember an ad for ancestry with a guy talking about how his family always thought they were German but the test came out Scottish, so that was what they were now embracing instead.  I always wanted to scream at the tv that in the early modern period, especially the 30 years war there were a huge number of Scottish mercenaries in what is now Germany. After they decided to get out of that business, a lot of those people settled down and over time their descendants ended up culturally German. I can\u2019t say for sure that this was the case with that guy, but I can completely see how people might take this new genetic information and feel like it represents more than the cultural element. It\u2019s definitely part of the story and is cool to know, but I just find it kinda tragic that people have a tendency to view genetics as more real just because it\u2019s a hard record inside us.
