You aren't going to change these horrible people. And I say people because your brother in law is tolerating this, in his own home and with his child so he is as much at fault here. He should have intervened and put Eric in his place, but then again, he must know what he's like and has chosen to be with him and raise children with him so he is probably an asshole too.\n\nIf I were you (and I'm not so take this as you would), I would consider the banishment from their house a fantastic excuse to have nothing to do with these people in the future. Your wife might feel differently though and she might have some real interest in cultivating a relationship with her nephews.

Eric is gross to exploit Maria and expect a toddler to have adult manners.", "NTA.  It makes me sad to think this Eric jerk is a father to any child.  I imagine that poor woman who is the wet nurse is desperate for employment to put up with him.  You stood up for her child, and even if she dared not say anything, I'm sure she appreciated it.  Your brother-in-law probably isn't used to people calling him out on his bad behavior and racism because he's a doctor.", "Liz?

A bigot who is exploiting your nephew's wet nurse and treating her children like trash. \n\nI won't judge them for finding a wet nurse but I do hope someone tells Maria that her services are worth at least a grand a week (I am presuming this is in the US) and she needn't settle for being paid poorly and treated worse.\n\n\nEdit- Aguardiente is the unofficial \"national drink\" in Columbia , not tequila. \n(God my Google history looks psycho)", "this happened to my buddy eric once", "Yeah a wet nurse for a 2yo is a stretch.", "Lost me at 19 year old doctor", "Wet nurses are not uncommon around the world though they are less common in the West. More often, people who cannot nurse their own children (not just gay couples, but also many women who do not produce enough milk) but want to retain the health benefits of breast milk will use a milk bank not hire a wet nurse.  \n\n\nWhat I'd be more curious about is if the woman in question is being fairly compensated. One of the fathers in question is a doctor so my guess is that given his knowledge of potential health risks, he has not just randomly hired a woman with no screening. The going rate for a full time wet nurse is thousands a month.", "They're real, just as real as midwives which I thought were like a career from the past. Turns out that they still exist and in some circumstances can have more authority than the hospital for decisions made for a client's birth and baby. \n\nMy friend's wife had their baby last year and had a midwife, had their baby at home and then had the midwife basically stay at the hospital until the two were released. \n\nTalking with her was facasnicting.\n\nAlthough if I'm being honest I think it's far more common for women to pump their milk and sell that opposed to being a wet nurse, which is something I'm surprised people are cool with as it's an insanely intimate feeding and bonding experience.", "People with serious money can definitely act this way.

But as someone who grew up working class and then worked for many years in the service industry (in restaurants, as a delivery driver, as a housecleaner and lawn care) and I have several friends who are nannies, I can tell you that it's extremely common for rich people to treat the people who work for them with disdain, act like employing them is an act of charity for which they should be grateful, and yes being openly racist and misogynistic. They can get away with all of this so they do so.\n\nI'd say in my experience it's like half of them are not this way, and half are to a certain extent (probably 10% are exceptionally blatantly abusive often without even knowing it or at least not showing any indication that they know it).", "Happens to all of us sometimes lol", "There were several people who also misread that sentence and were corrected before you even commented so it should have been abudantly clear.
