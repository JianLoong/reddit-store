Shes really funny and sweet but can get very dramatic.\nSometime in early January we figured she might be pregnant because we\u2019ve been having sex without a condom during her fertile days. Her period was over a week late so she decided to schedule an appointment at the gynecologist. The earliest they could get her was February 14th\nTowards the end of January she miscarried. She was only bleeding for like 10 days and recovered just fine\n\nToday is valentines day, and also the date of her gyno appt. I had forgotten to get her a card and make a reservation at a restaurant so I was obviously stressed. I slept over at her house but i still had to go to the bakery to get myself some breakfast then go to the post office to drop off a package (and get the card) so I left at 10:30 AM. I admit I had completely forgotten about her appt but again, I was stressed. \nAt around 12 PM my gf called me in absolute distress and screamed at me that she hated me because I\u2018m a selfish AH etc. I calmly asked her what was going on but she just kept screaming at me.\nApparently on my way out I got the doormat stuck under the door. Thats it. \nThe door was blocked from opening so she missed her gyno appointment.\nIn my country when you don\u2019t attend a doctors appt you get fined. Idk the exact amount but we\u2019re talking about a couple hundred \u20ac I think\nI asked her what she wants me to do now and she screamed she wants me to pay the fine then hung up\nShe texted me saying Im a self centered idiot. I obviously got mad so I texted her back \u201eYour right. It was my plan to trap you in your house so there\u2019s no way you could go to the check up. /s\u201c I didnt mean to be rude but I just had to show her how ridiculous she sounded. It was obviously a mistake I didn\u2019t mean to stop her from going. \nShe then berated me for not apologizing to her. I dont think thats fair at all, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose\nI do understand this sucks for her because now she has to pay the fine and schedule a new appointment which is gonna cost even more \u20ac. Atp I told her to just not reschedule because the bleeding has stopped 2 weeks ago\nShe wants me to give her at least half the amount of money she\u2019ll have to pay for the fine and shes still really mad at me. \nI dont think I should have to pay because it wasn\u2019t my fault the doormat got stuck under the door when I left\nI texted her that of course I\u2018m sorry but shes being way too emotional. None of this would\u2019ve happened if she\u2019d just get on birth control.\nSo am I the asshole for accidentally blocking the door?\n\nTLDR; my gf missed her gyno appointment and now she thinks I should pay the fine", "created_utc": 1676384502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1126j0e/aita_for_making_my_gf_miss_her_follow_up_gyno/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of issues can come with a miscarriage.\n\nYou also seemed to be more concerned with Valentine's Day than the appointment with how stressed you got from forgetting it. \n\nThe miscarriage was half your deal, you were just as responsible for making sure you didn't forget about it. \n\nObviously, you didn't want her to miss it on purpose, but you still made an error that impacted someone else, so make it right.

I'll be honest, didn't finish reading the post after \"She was only bleeding for like 10 days and recovered just fine\".

Fuck that.

Yeah, the doormat wasn't on purpose, however, your inadvertent actions caused her to miss her appointment. The appointment  might I add that was scheduled to make sure she's recovered from miscarrying your baby.

For not being careful when you shut the door. For responding sarcastically & defensively when she was upset that she missed her appointment. For downplaying the physical and emotional effects of a miscarriage. She was \u201conly bleeding for like 10 days\u201d? Seriously? That sounds horrifying. \n\nAlso, the reason you were so distracted and rushing to get out the door this morning is because you totally flaked on Valentine\u2019s Day.

Do you not understand that a miscarriage can leave behind fetal/embryonic tissue that can lead to a serious infection?\n\nI can understand if the doormat thing was an accident, but your handling of it was completely out of line! At a minimum, you should (1) pay the fine (since it really is your fault, intentional or otherwise, that she missed the appointment, (2) ***grovel*** and apologize with true sincerity, and (3) make sure you go with her to her follow up appointment to show that you support her and care about her health.\n\nJust because \"the bleeding stopped\" doesn't mean it's over.

Just because the bleeding stopped doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t material that needs to be shed from her uterus and it can lead to a deadly infection if not taken care of. \n\n2) Miscarrying more than \u2018sucks\u2019. It is a life changing, emotionally draining experience that can leave you reeling for years. Your girlfriend needs you to lean in and be supportive here and you sound very dismissive. \n\n3) You also created the situation through your lack of planning and time management. So not only has she lost a baby, gotten a significant fine cause someone didn\u2019t plan well and rushed out and locked her in (even inadvertently), but she\u2019s also going to find out that this person who is supposed to be her significant other forgot to plan for Valentine\u2019s Day. \n\n4) BIRTH CONTROL IS BAD FOR THE FEMALE BODY!!! It cause weigh gain, blood clots, and hormonal imbalances. You don\u2019t get to pin this whole situation on her. YOU ARE JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR BIRTH CONTROL!!!

Pay the fine for her as it IS YOUR FAULT. It's also partially YOUR FAULT that she got pregnant in the first place.

Shes really funny and sweet but can get very dramatic.\nSometime in early January we figured she might be pregnant because we\u2019ve been having sex without a condom during her fertile days. Her period was over a week late so she decided to schedule an appointment at the gynecologist. The earliest they could get her was February 14th\nTowards the end of January she miscarried. She was only bleeding for like 10 days and recovered just fine\n\nToday is valentines day, and also the date of her gyno appt. I had forgotten to get her a card and make a reservation at a restaurant so I was obviously stressed. I slept over at her house but i still had to go to the bakery to get myself some breakfast then go to the post office to drop off a package (and get the card) so I left at 10:30 AM. I admit I had completely forgotten about her appt but again, I was stressed. \nAt around 12 PM my gf called me in absolute distress and screamed at me that she hated me because I\u2018m a selfish AH etc. I calmly asked her what was going on but she just kept screaming at me.\nApparently on my way out I got the doormat stuck under the door. Thats it. \nThe door was blocked from opening so she missed her gyno appointment.\nIn my country when you don\u2019t attend a doctors appt you get fined. Idk the exact amount but we\u2019re talking about a couple hundred \u20ac I think\nI asked her what she wants me to do now and she screamed she wants me to pay the fine then hung up\nShe texted me saying Im a self centered idiot. I obviously got mad so I texted her back \u201eYour right. It was my plan to trap you in your house so there\u2019s no way you could go to the check up. /s\u201c I didnt mean to be rude but I just had to show her how ridiculous she sounded. It was obviously a mistake I didn\u2019t mean to stop her from going. \nShe then berated me for not apologizing to her. I dont think thats fair at all, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose\nI do understand this sucks for her because now she has to pay the fine and schedule a new appointment which is gonna cost even more \u20ac. Atp I told her to just not reschedule because the bleeding has stopped 2 weeks ago\nShe wants me to give her at least half the amount of money she\u2019ll have to pay for the fine and shes still really mad at me. \nI dont think I should have to pay because it wasn\u2019t my fault the doormat got stuck under the door when I left\nI texted her that of course I\u2018m sorry but shes being way too emotional. None of this would\u2019ve happened if she\u2019d just get on birth control.\nSo am I the asshole for accidentally blocking the door?\n\nTLDR; my gf missed her gyno appointment and now she thinks I should pay the fine\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I guess luckily I didn\u2019t experience the negative side effects.  I am usually up to date about issues affecting women and reproductive health and rights.  I really am uneducated about this problem.  I am definitely going to research this on my own now but I am really concerned there is no safe birth control choices for women.
