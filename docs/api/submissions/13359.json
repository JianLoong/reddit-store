Alexandra is generally a cold person, and doesn't get along with our family very well.\n\nI prepared a room for them, and a separate room for their kids. I had to move a lot of furniture to accomodate their stay and I was extremely excited. My son (Harry - 40M) helped me a lot with the process, and he was also very excited to see his niece and nephew.\n\nTheir flight landed yesterday. My son came with me to pick them up from the airport and drive them home, but we realized they had arranged for a driver, and I learned then that they had also booked a hotel room for themselves. I couldn't believe it.\n\nI talked to Hailey about this. She said she never intended to stay at home with me because she wasn't comfortable. I know she means Alexandra is the one who doesn't like to stay with us and gets uncomfortable. I said what was done was done but maybe they could cancel the hotel. Hailey said no. I asked again because I had prepared them rooms and assured it would be comfirtable. She said a hotel stay would be easier on everyone. \n\nI asked my grandkids if they wanted to come stay with me, but they also said they wanted to be with their moms and they said they'd come see me everyday anyway. I am honestly hurt. I told Hailey it was horrible that she had gotten so used to her luxurious life that she couldn't bear staying at her own home. She didn't answer and left to the hotel.\n\nMy son told me I was being too rough on them. I honestly feel insulted but I need an objective opinion on this. What are your thoughts?\n\nEdit: My daughter visited me alone for the past 4 times and she stayed with me for them. The last time she visited with her family was 7 years ago and they had stayed with us then too. \n\nAbout this visit, Hailey sent me the details of their stay in email but I don't really check it so I missed it.

And the rest of your post makes me think SHE MEANT JUST WHAT SHE SAID.\n\nAfter hearing your daughter was uncomfortable and was staying at a hotel, you tried to use her kids against her and asked them to stay with you? That's messed up, and completely unacceptable. Her kids, she told you where they were staying, and you simply didn't give a f\\*ck.\n\nThen you tried to guilt her by saying her \"luxurious lifestyle\" meant she basically hated you all.\n\nSounds like you need to grow up.", "YTA\n\nI hate to tell you this, but it is not their luxurious lifestyle that leads them to stay in hotel rooms, it is how you treat them. You're not reading the tea leaves here, but they visit less frequently, don't stay with you when they do, *and do not even communicate their plans.*\n\nThey either have lost respect for you for some specific reason, or you have made them uncomfortable being in your home. They flat out said the latter, and it appears you did not even ask why, you assumed it was her wife. That to me is a strong indicator that you are the one who needs to examine their behavior, not your daughter.", "INFO: Why is Alexandra uncomfortable around you? It feels like that part of the story is missing.\n\nFor now, you yourself admit you don't get along well with Alexandra. Your daughter reserves a hotel to make everyone a bit more comfortable. What would you rather happen, Alexandra take the brunt of the discomfort for your sake? YTA.", "YTA. You couldn\u2019t even be bothered to read the email she sent you about the visit, and then got hostile about something you definitely already should have known about? No wonder they don\u2019t want to stay with you. There is probably a reason they don\u2019t visit and your daughter in law isn\u2019t comfortable in your home- just the way you blatantly blame her for all of this screams loads about how you view her, and likely treat her. \n\nTake a step back and ask yourself when was the last time you asked what they wanted, what would make them comfortable, and what would work best for them, and the didn\u2019t complain about it?", "YTA\n\nYou're an adult.  You need to manage your mail.  If you refuse to spend 10-15 minutes regularly to check your mail and miss important things like your daughter's itinerary, that's on you.\n\nShe communicated.  You just missed that communication because you couldn't be arsed to check your mail.  People don't need to call you to remind you to check your email because they sent you something.  It's not the 1990's anymore.  That was 30 years ago.   \n\nDouble YTA for putting the kids in the middle and trying to shame/guilt your daughter when this was all your fault for not checking your email OR checking in with your daughter.", "Info: What conversations about arrangements were had before their arrival?  This is impossible to judge without that information and it is a bit suspect that it is missing from the post.  Yeah, OP did a lot work but that is meaningless if they knew other plans were already in place.", "Yes you're the asshole. You're clearly not as delightful a host as you think you are. \n\nPlus \"couldn't bear staying at her own home\". It's NOT her home it's your home and I personally understand not wanting to be an awkward guest in a crowded house when there's no need for it.\n\nThey're here to visit you, not recreate your daughter's childhood by forcing her to live in your house.", "Of course YTA. They\u2019re adults and can decide for themselves what makes them comfortable.  I for one DESPISE staying at anyone\u2019s home and always get a hotel when visiting out of town friends or family. I never understood why anyone would be upset by this. Leave them alone or they won\u2019t visit you at all", "Wow, you are determined to drive them further away. Horrible? There are more feelings involved than just yours. You were wrong to try and go around them by asking the kids. YTA for that alone. If they feel more comfortable and rested to be able to get some alone time at night in a hotel then they get to make that decision. You will drive them to visit less by filling the visit with guilt and undermining their roles as parents.", "You should have discussed accommodations in advance. You know what they say about assuming things... \n\n- YTA for becoming pushy and dismissing their feelings; where they will be comfortable is not at your discretion.\n- YTA for side stepping what your daughter laid down and asking the kids if they wanted to stay with you.\n- YTA for your dramatic last ditch response and attempting to guilt your daughter by saying something like it's HORRIBLE she'd gotten so used to her LUXURIOUS life that she COULDN'T BEAR staying at her own home. *Not her home anymore, btw.\n\nIt is no surprise that you make them uncomfortable by the way you've described handling this situation. \n\nIf they're more comfortable in a hotel, then it shouldn't be the end of the world. You still get to visit with them. Be grateful and save the tempur tantrum.", "This post reminds me very much of my grandmother, may she rest in peace. I absolutely adored her, but she was controlling in this way as well. Her youngest moved from the midwest to a coast for college and never moved \"back home.\" She met and married her husband there, and they're now raising a lovely family.\n\nOnce the kids were out of infancy, my aunt and her family began twice-yearly visits back to our home state. Grandma *insisted* they stay at her home, even though she'd downsized to an apartment barely suitable for herself and her cat. She stocked up the pantry and fridge, somehow her car was always in the shop, and arranged for old friends to visit and meet her coastal grandkids. She did everything in her power to keep them locked down for the duration of their visits, to the point where after a few visits, my aunt traveled alone.\n\nEventually, she stopped coming altogether. The whining and guilting once she stood up for herself and rented hotels and cars were as much of a stifling hassle as being cramped up in Grandma's apartment for two weeks. Now that my grandmother has passed, their visits have increased to 3x/year and the oldest even flies out on his own to spend long weekends off school with Grandpa.\n\nMy grandmother, much like your responses indicate, could not be reasoned with on this topic. It didn't matter how gently you told her that the kids are getting too old to be entertained by VHS and checkers. It didn't matter when you pointed out that an air mattress was not good for my uncle's sciatica. It didn't matter if you very reasonably said that people who have to wrangle car seats should rent a car so that *on the off chance* Grandma agrees they should go anyplace but church, there's not a freaking fire drill in the driveway trying to wedge everyone into the vehicle. No, none of that mattered because it wasn't what she wanted.\n\nYou're treading a dangerous path toward being no-contact with Hailey and her family. If they haven't stayed with you as a family unit for seven years, you have an exact date to reflect back on and determine what finally drove them off. Until then, YTA", "YTA.  She sent you an email with her plans.  This is 100% on you for missing that.  And then trying to push them to change those plans once they arrived is also an a-hole move.", "YTA.  Boundaries were clearly established, and you had zero interest respecting them. But keep pushing when the answer is no, and I'm sure the limited visits you have will continue to decrease. No means no, period. Trying to go behind their backs to the grandkids is gross as shit too. \n\nAlso, it's literally nothing personal, but sleeping in someone else's house is weird and uncomfortable for MANY people.", "YTA.  If family wants to stay in a hotel while they visit, there is a very good reason.  I would bet real money that staying in a hotel was the compromise between your daughter and her wife to even make the trip.  \n\nAlso, it sounds like you made a lot of assumptions about how they would travel from the airport or where they would stay without confirming it first.  Some of those behaviors are probably not helping the situation.", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s an adult with a family and they made a decision about where they felt most comfortable staying", "YTA- you assumed they were staying with you and didn't bother to ASK.  Not everyone wants to stay at their inlaws house 24/7 and need breaks away.  Your daughter has her own family now, and wants time alone with them.", "YTA because they emailed you that they would be staying in the hotel so they make an effort to communicate. You made a lot of assumptions about their visit but didn\u2019t think to clarify.", "You need to ask people if they want to stay with you instead of assuming.  YTA", "YTA. If they normally stay with you when they come visit, then they should have told you about the change in plans ahead of time, but that's a pretty minor issue. They don't want to stay with you, and you need to respect their choice and enjoy the time you have together. Maybe offer to have the kids over if they ever want a romantic getaway or something. Your comment towards Hailey was really rude, especially since you don't even believe she's the one uncomfortable staying with you.", "YTA and if you keep on behaving as you have been, they will cut you out completely.\n\nI was mostly sympathetic until you snapped back when your daughter expressed her (reasonable) boundary. I'll break it down:\n\n>She said a hotel stay would be easier on everyone.\n\nYour daughter set the boundary and expects you to respect it. That's how adults function in the world.\n\n>I asked my grandkids if they wanted to come stay with me, but they also said they wanted to be with their moms and they said they'd come see me everyday anyway. I am honestly hurt.\n\nRather than RESPECT the boundary your daughter gave you, you tried to manipulate her children away from her and then are HURT when the kids choose their mothers over a grandma they have had very little contact with. They haven't seen you in person in SEVEN YEARS. Your house is a strange location for them.\n\n>I told Hailey it was horrible that she had gotten so used to her luxurious life that she couldn't bear staying at her own home. She didn't answer and left to the hotel.\n\nWhen you didn't get your way, you were rude, dismissive, and basically, an asshole. Your house is NOT her home. It's yours.\n\nYou keep on disrespecting her boundaries. It's not the house she doesn't want, it's your disrespectful manipulations. In other words: she can't bear staying WITH YOU.", "YTA. If I can tell how much you loathe your daughter\u2019s wife, so can they - I mean Hailey, Alexandra, and the kids can all tell how you feel - and blaming Alexandra for everything is a bad look when it\u2019s so clear you can\u2019t stand her that I practically had to defrost my phone to respond. \n\nYour dislike for Alexandra is laced throughout your entire post. But Hailey loves you - enough to visit you alone, likely to avoid the way your feelings about her wife glow radioactively through whatever mask you think you keep over them - but she got a hotel this time because she won\u2019t subject her wife to your hostility, and that\u2019s exactly what a good person does for their spouse.", "YTA, sometimes people are just more comfortable having separation. Forgetting missing info, you need to respect people\u2019s boundaries and this was theirs. Sometimes it makes for a happier visit", "YTA. Something happened during the last visit seven years ago.  That was the last time they all visited as a family and the last time they all stayed at your house.  Maybe it\u2019s something you have forgotten but it was enough for them that it was the last straw.  By the way they are spending time visiting you so it\u2019s not a total lost cause.  It\u2019s just not the way you want it.  You could try welcoming them and appreciate that they have travelled to see you\u2026.rather than complaining about them staying at a hotel.", "It was almost N A H, until you insulted your daughter when she didn't change her plans. You guys should have communicated but you didn't and that caused this, now you know for next time, don't make it worse with passvie agressive insults.   \n\n\n I think it was very kind of you to get everything ready for them. But it's clear that Alexandra doesn't feel comfortable in your home for some reason or another. Your daughter is priotitizing her SO as she should. She's visiting, but wants to make it the best for all invovled, and that includes a hotel for her family. Accept that. YTA", "You were out of line asking the kids where they wanted to be and undermining their parents. Which gives me a hint of why Alexandra is \"cold\" and wanted to be in a hotel. You didn't read the email so that's on you. I get hints of a lot of guilt tripping and trying to steamroll Hailey into doing what you want even after they told you what they decided to do. I think you need to stop and examine your behavior over the past few years for the missing reasons why things are the way they are.", "YTA and I feel like you are not telling us everything. Why is she uncomfortable with you? Were you maybe not so accepting of their same sex relationship to start with?", "Why does Alexandria feel uncomfortable around you?? That part concerns me.", "YTA - Two adults and a teenager and pre teen is very different from two adults and two small children. She sent an email with the details and you did not read it closely. There was no reason for her to call you because she had sent the info. You went ahead and made all these set ups with out reaching out or confirming anything. It also sounds like you\u2019re description of Alexandra is to gain sympathy for your efforts, but it makes me suspicious that she is cold because you are not accepting of her and/or your daughter\u2019s sexuality.", "YTA. My family stays in a hotel when we visit my in-laws. Not because they don\u2019t have space, but because it\u2019s more comfortable for my family and gives us some downtime in our own space. It does not mean we are too good for my SO\u2019s childhood home, it simply means we feel more comfortable having our own space. \n\nYou need to stop blaming your DIL and allow them to do what works for them and enjoy the visit. If this is the first time the entire family has come to visit you really should adjust the attitude or it will never happen again.", "You're making yourself a martyr for no reason.\n\nETA: You went to all that effort without asking her and without paying attention to her email.  Given how dismissive you are of her communications and of her wife, it seems likely there are a lot more issues here.  Instead of making her out to be a villain hurting your feelings, you might want to respect the life she has built.  Get to know her on her own terms and see if you can repair your relationship with her.", ">About this visit, Hailey sent me the details of their stay in email but I don't really check it so I missed it. I don't know why she didn't call to be honest\n\nBecause she didn't want to have the conversation repeatedly as the time to visit approached. Your failure to read an email caused all that extra work. \n\n>She said she never intended to stay at home with me because she wasn't comfortable. I know she means Alexandra is the one who doesn't like to stay with us and gets uncomfortable\n\nMaybe neither of them are comfortable in your home. You did call your daughter-in-law cold. Maybe they sense disapproval. \n\n> I told Hailey it was horrible that she had gotten so used to her luxurious life that she couldn't bear staying at her own home. \n\nWell that was rude and manipulative. Little hint- your home is not her home. She is 37 and married with children.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nThem wanting to stay in a hotel instead of at your house is *not* a personal attack against you. You're TA for treating it like it is. Whether there's underlying history that would also explain Alexandra being cold and distant towards your family, or it's something completely innocuous like the hotel has a swimming pool and you don't, comments like:\n\n>I told Hailey it was horrible that she had gotten so used to her luxurious life that she couldn't bear staying at her own home.\n\nare not justified. Also, it's 2023, check your email regularly.", "YTA sounds like you\u2019d rather be right than enjoy their visit.", "YTA\n\nFor not reading, for not accepting their decision, for trying to override it with guilt and then their own kids, and now trying to play the victim.\n\nIt is a LOT to stay in someone else's home. Nevermind when they have a family dynamic going on and expectations of things being done their way. It's also supposed to be a vacation. Let them do whatever is comfortable to them.\n\nDon't get me wrong - this wouldn't fly in my family - it would be insulting for sure - it's cultural, you always stay with family - it's much less quality time - but you need to realize it's not the same for all families or cultures.", "YTA\n\nBoy, you put in a lot effort for something that could have been avoided if you asked.", "YTA. You sound like my MIL. You didn\u2019t check the email but blaming her for not telling you. She did, you didn\u2019t listen. \n\nI love my parents to bits but I would prefer a hotel to their house only because I feel more free and comfortable doing so. It has nothing to do with how much I want to hang out with them.", "INFO Why did you plan on them staying with you if you hadn't discussed it? As you said you had to move furniture so your house isn't default ready for four guests. 4 guests means less space and potentially fewer bathrooms to start. \n\nWhy did you plan on getting her from the airport without discussing it? I might be alone in this but I've never traveled to see someone and assumed I'd stay with them, it's a discussion.\n\nWhy do you think it's Alexandra that's uncomfortable?", "There are a lot of missing missing reasons here. \n\nYTA.", "NAH\n\nYou were expecting them to stay at the home.  They were expecting to stay in a hotel.\n\n\"Alexandra is generally a cold person, and doesn't get along with our family very well.\"\n\nTime to be honest with yourself.  You don't have to answer here.  \"How accepting and hospitable was your family at Alexandra and Hailey's wedding? Engagement? Baby Shower?\"", "Maybe I can offer some insight from the other side because in my family, I am the daughter who doesn't visit often enough and has the \"cold\" spouse who \"doesn't get along with our family very well\".  In reality, he's just a quiet person and an introvert, so he doesn't say much.  His natural face is also a bit of a frown, so while he's not unhappy or upset, he is not quick to smile either, so they see all of that as him being cold and not getting along.  It's easier for them to blame him for our lack of visits than to accept that maybe I don't want to visit either.  \n\nMy dad and step-mom haven't done anything wrong - we are just very different people.  One thing that drives me crazy is that they talk all the time.  From the time I arrive to the time I leave - they are talking.  And they bicker about stuff.  No one is ever given the opportunity to decompress.  It's never quiet.  And if someone isn't talking, they are singing and playing music.  If you go outside or in another room for some quiet, like to read a book, they come with you - to see what you are doing, how you are, if you are ok. They are also relatively self-centered and take everything personally, so if we don't always show the happy-shiny-people version of ourselves, they want to know what they've done wrong - and they won't accept that nothing is wrong, they must have done something.  It's a whole thing, and it is exhausting.  Visiting would be so much nicer if we could stay in a hotel so that we would have time to decompress and just be quiet.  Unfortunately, they live in a rural area and there aren't any hotels.  \n\nI don't know if any of this rings true to your situation, but I mention it because there could be a variety of reasons for the fewer visits and the decision to stay in a hotel.  If you want to have a decent relationship with your kids and grand kids, then please accept their boundaries.  Don't assume bad intentions just because things didn't work out the way you envisioned.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like there was no communication about where your daughter's family would stay. Although preparing the room was a very nice thing, it sounds like you had no confirmation that your daughter needed a room.", "Softly, YTA. Hailey communicated where she was staying, whether you bothered to check or not, but you did not communicate your expectations of her staying with you to Hailey for her to correct those expectations. Instead, you psyched yourself up with these uncommunicated expectations that Hailey and her family would stay in your home, and then dropped your disappointemnt on Hailey and *blamed her wife* for Hailey's decisions on where they were staying. You then also tried to undermine their decisions by bringing their kids in on it to manipulate everyone into staying with you so you could get what you wanted.\n\nDo you really not see why they would go low contact when you're so melodramatic that you use phrases like \"betrayed\" to describe someone visiting you and staying in a hotel?", "Both of you should have discussed these arrangements before they arrived.

You sound hard to get along with honestly from your tone, but I'm going to go off what you've presented here only. You should have communicated the plan in more detail with your daughter, and let her know your plans to move the furniture around. If she had known, maybe she could have told her wife and convinced her to stay with you guys, OR at the least you would have found out way earlier they weren't planning on staying with you. And you could have avoided moving all that stuff around. Try to do better communicating with your kid; life is short and clearly you want a relationship with them.

Just poor communication and expectation management.\n\nThere is no one to blame, but hopes turned into expectations without confirming anything beforehand usually lead to bad feelings.\n\nYou insinuated that there's likely to be some friction between Alexandra and your family (not in those words, but I sense some negativity towards her).

If so, she might be doing everyone a favor by staying at a hotel.\n\nEither way, I wish you all the best.", "ESH. When my husband visits my mother with me, I always book a hotel for his comfort. He is my priority since he\u2019s my spouse. That being said, I always tell my mother ahead of time. She is never surprised by this.

You\u2019re just a grandmother who wants to see the woman you raised for decades and your grandchildren.

Express to them what it would mean for them to sleep under your roof, provide for them meals, and be a host to your family.\n\nEdit: my ex wife is gay and left me for a woman she had a 3 year affair with and we share a son. Her mother does not approve at all and thinks she has lost her mind (she\u2019s catholic and got involved deeply with religion when her husband suffered from stage 4 pancreatic cancer) and that causes so many issues when it comes to them visiting her and they stay in hotels to control the visits and time spent. She is beyond hurt and I feel for her. I hate her daughter for having an affair and I hate her wife for being the person who took 9 years of time under my roof with my son from me; but, I feel for his grandmother because she\u2019s lost time with my son due to her daughter being selfish and a narcissistic bitch.", "You can either choose to be offended and get angry, or you can choose to let it go and try to have a good time. \n\nNAH here yet.", "What conversations did you have, if any before their visit about accommodations?

I know she means Alexandra is the one who doesn't like to stay with us and gets uncomfortable. I said what was done was done but maybe they could cancel the hotel. Hailey said no. I asked again because I had prepared them rooms and assured it would be comfirtable. She said a hotel stay would be easier on everyone. \n\nI asked my grandkids if they wanted to come stay with me, but they also said they wanted to be with their moms and they said they'd come see me everyday anyway. I am honestly hurt. I told Hailey it was horrible that she had gotten so used to her luxurious life that she couldn't bear staying at her own home. She didn't answer and left to the hotel.\n\nMy son told me I was being too rough on them. I honestly feel insulted but I need an objective opinion on this.

We would only stay in my parents house if we arrive super late and the day we leave since 9 out of 10 times my mom is the one that takes us and gets us from the airport. And given the fact that they\u2019re bringing children ,I\u2019m guessing they have a routine that want to try and keep even on vacation and grandparents are known to cross boundaries and let their grandchildren do whatever the want even if it means going against what the parent said.", "YTA.

You should likely change your view to being grateful and happy your daughter and her family are not only still willing to visit you, but obviously do love you despite your difficulties in life and personality as they willingly pay for a hotel out of pocket which is not cheap these days.

OP, I always used to get a hotel room when I visited my mom, though I was well aware that it hurt her feelings. My brother did the same during the times before he bought a house in the nearby city and later when it was rented out. There were multiple reasons for this, and none were because we enjoyed hurting her. Consider whether any of the below, or something similar, might apply to your daughter and her family.\n\nFirst and foremost was that she and my stepfather were smokers. Smoke coated or permeated every surface in the house. After permanently moving out, both of us found that our bodies could not tolerate being in that house for more than a handful of hours in a row without becoming ill. Short visits gave me a cold afterwards at least half of the time. Sleeping a full night on one of her pillows probably would have given me pneumonia. \n\nOther pertinent reasons that still would have applied regardless, however, in no particular order: \n\n- my mother was, unfortunately, somewhat racist. My SIL is black. They were polite to each other and mom loved my niblings, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have asked her to tolerate that with no break.\n- my parents were poor, so the mattresses were decades old. Not super comfortable.\n- Mom was jealous and possessive of our visiting time, and could make it extremely difficult to visit other friends and family while you were in town. Having a excuse to leave at a reasonable hour sometimes gave us an opportunity to see those people that we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise gotten without pushing back hard enough that it hurt her feelings way worse.\n- our old rooms had long since become the room where my stepfather normally slept in and a storage room, respectively. Not comfortable to come back to.\n- I\u2019m kind of an introvert and it was nice to be able to be by myself (or, before my divorce, with my husband) for a couple of hours at the end of a long day of visiting.", "YTA, this is the same type of crap my mother would try to pull.  I would never stay at their house because you become trapped there with the manipulative comments and all the comes with being around her.  You act the same way and it your comments just reminded me of that nonsense.\n\nEdit:  This beyond pisses me off.  You would love nothing more than to hold them hostage with no car and no place to get away from you which you act like the victim.", "YTA.

If you keep pushing I can promise you they won't come back.", "Yeah just go ahead and log off for the day, YTA for being so purposely obtuse and manipulative.", "Yta. And your behavior in this single incident makes it clear why H chose to get a hotel room. \n\n1. Not bothering to actually read her communication about travel plans. \n\n2. Blaming her wife for every decision she makes. This right here would piss me right off. \n\n3. Bringing the kids into an adult conversation to try and get your way. It would have been one thing a day or two into the visit pulling the parents aside to *ask* if you can invite the kids for an overnight. But you didn't. You tried to get the kids all hyped up for a sleepover to put H on the spot. \n\n4 you kept asking after you heard a no. \n\nYou seem terribly overbearing. And this is a single instance.

You clearly don\u2019t respect their boundaries or their decisions, which are reasonable.", "YTA, and judging by some of the passive aggressive and downright rude things you said, I can see why your daughter and her family don\u2019t want to stay with you.

Just because you don't like the woman she loves doesn't mean she doesn't.", "lmao. obvious YTA. You're despicable.", "INFO: Several things I'm going to address following this sentence.\n\nThere's a lot missing here. The \"luxurious life-style\" accusation kind of comes out of nowhere at the very end. \n\nYour daughter says she's the one who's uncomfortable staying with you, but you gloss over it by blaming her wife. \n\nYou say her wife is cold, but gloss over the details of that, too. \n\nYou... apparently assumed they were staying in your house and needed a ride from the airport without confirming that to be the case? You missed her email, she didn't call, and you just... didn't talk about where she was staying and how she was leaving the airport at all somehow? Do you have a history of just assuming things and doing things without talking to her first? And then making her feel guilty when she had other plans already?\n\nI don't really want to assume a judgment when I feel like there are still so many missing pieces. Given that this story flags as one of those \"The Missing Missing Reasons\" scenarios, though, it doesn't look good for you.", ">About this visit, Hailey sent me the details of their stay in email but I don't really check it so I missed it. I don't know why she didn't call to be honest\n\nYou don't listen to her even when things are in writing, where it's neatly and conveniently saved to be absorbed in detail at your own pace. There's no reason to believe you'd \"remember\" it if she said it out loud. Maybe try hearing her? YTA", "I like visiting my family, and if it is just me I\u2019m fine staying at their house if I have privacy and some freedom to set the schedule, come and go, etc. That all changes when my husband and son come with me. It gets crowded, less privacy, bathroom issues, space issues, etc. It is far more comfortable for us to get our own room/suite/rental when we all travel together, and it has nothing to do with who we are visiting. YTA for not realizing that your own daughter feeling comfortable staying with her family at your home is far different than her, her wife, and two kids you barely see being comfortable there, too. And for guilting them and nagging them about it.", "YTA\n\nIf they don't want to stay with you--no matter what the reason--they don't have to stay with you. But I would wonder about it too. Maybe it's because you try to tell them what to do, or because you call your DIL cold, or because you try to make end runs around your daughter and DIL to get their kids on your side. Maybe your house is nasty, or smelly, or too small, or they just want some time away from you. It doesn't matter, really.\n\nSo here are two pieces of advise:\n\n1) Read your email, or if you can't handle that, call your daughter yourself and confirm the details ahead of time.\n\n2) Be grateful they are spending their time and money to visit you. It would be much easier on them to stay home or to go elsewhere. But they're there with you and for you. Appreciate it!", "YTA.  She sent you the details.  The fact that you didn\u2019t check means the wasted work you did getting ready for her stay is 100% on you.  You are also making way to big a deal about their staying in a hotel.  Instead of insisting upon having things your own way, just be grateful your daughter and her family came to visit and enjoy the time you have with them.", "YTA: according to your edit, they told you they were staying in a hotel, it sounds like you thought you could guilt them into staying with you (seeing as you did so much work) and then you moved onto guilting the kids. \n\nUntil you see the issues with your own behaviour, your relationship won\u2019t ever improve- but by the sound of this post, you don\u2019t care for Alexandra either way.", "This is going to start rough for you but I hope you read all of it. YTA for ignoring the email details and ignoring the plans made by deciding your adult daughter & dil. YTA for not respecting your adult child's boundaries. YTA for the attempt to manipulate the situation using HER children. YTA for belittling your daughter about her financial lifestyle. Reread what you wrote. Do not see how unpleasant you were after not seeing them for do long? And right after they got off the plane?\n\nYTA for blaiming the Alexandra. Let me tell you what it's like to deal with a MIL who does that. My ex and I would make a decision completely together, or make a decision that was more him leading the way or (really read this next part!) HE would make a decision that I chose to support as his wife. When my in-laws didn't like it they blamed me and let me know it. My mil specifically, was fairly mean and hurtful when I was young and expecting our first child and her first grandchild. \n\nThen, early in my current marriage my husband chose to distance himself from his rather dysfunctional family. ENTIRETY HIS DECISION. I was team trying to make things work with his family back then. Guess who has been so maligned by some of his family, that the members I have barely met have been shitty to me and talked behind my back? Do you think they have any relationship with him, me or our children today? Nope!\n\nIf, by some chance, Alexandra is, \"cold,\" and the reason they are staying in a hotel, do you honestly think you are not going to completely destroy any relationship you have with Hailey and your grandchildren by blaming her and being an showing your ass??? Have you considered that A. She is just different from you and accepted her for who she is? Or B. That you have behaved badly, in the past, just like you did at the airport and so she doesn't emotionally feel safe with you?\n\nYour only option is to sincerely apologize. Next, ask to have a conversation with your daughter and dil at a time you can all agree upon. Then, ask and really listen to why the refused to stay with you and why you see so little of them. But you have to actually listen respectfully, without interrupting what they have to say, no drama, no involving anyone else and no excuses. If you are lucky, Hailey won't end up going completely no contact with you and maybe you can salvage all of the relationships.", "You give off a strong vibe of not liking Alexandra. Ever stop to think that maybe YOU are the reason she doesn't feel comfortable in your home? \n\"Alexandra is generally a cold person, and doesn't get along with our family very well.\" Methinks again that it's YOU who is the problem here.\n\nYour daughter said no to staying at your home, so you went to the grandkids directly to ask them. You were already told that wasn't going to happen.\n\n\"About this visit, Hailey sent me the details of their stay in email but I don't really check it so I missed it.\" You just admitted that you didn't read the details.
