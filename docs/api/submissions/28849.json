Honestly him not accepting you saying you'd rather reschedule would make me even *more* uncomfortable with the idea of going to his house. I think you are making the right decision on not going there, and maybe it's for the best that this doesn't progress.", "NTA. RED FLAG. RUN. If this will be his only chance to \u201cgo on a date\u201d, then he would have no time to continue dating you\u2026 so why even go out on a date in the first place?! OP, there was no date. This was his plan all along. He does not want to date you, he just wants to invite you into his bed. No respectable 28 yo man would not take a person he is interested in out on a real date. Continue to trust your instincts and demand more for yourself. Don\u2019t cave to the pressure, and those pressuring you are not your friends.", "NTA \nHe is 28 in college parties... This is not normal behaviour if he as a 28 year old doesn't understand that a first date is not come to my house something is wrong with him.\n\nHere is a few mild reasons for this:\n\n- he wants a hook up and doesn't want to play the dating game, you are 21 should be easy to convince you\n- he's cheep doesn't want to spend money on dates again because he wants a hook up\n\nNow a few darker reasons:\n\n- you don't know how many people are in his house when you arrive. He is not coming over you are going there\n- you can be drugged without anyone knowing and it would be hard to prove\n- I think you can continue imagining in this direction\n\nBottom line is you will be uncomfortable on this date if it's one of the mild reasons you'll get a bad date if not you will regret going. In both cases I don't see any reason why you should agree. Dating is fun and exciting not being anxious about the other person's intentions", "NTA - Don't reschedule. He's being super sus. Run, OP. Run as fast as you can.", "NTA.  Sadly many (not all) Guys just don't understand the hesitation women have about going to a house alone.  They don't have to worry as much about being in a bad situation where something happens.  The fact that he is so pushy and doesn't get it should be a red flag.  Rather than respecting your reason he has pushed and even contacted someone  else negating your reasons as ridiculous.  Do you want to date someone that belittled how you felt... what about the next time you feel uncomfortable, are in a situation or place where you feel unsafe?  Will he blow off how you feel/ belittle you again? \nThis guy isn't mature enough and obviously doesn't respect how you feel.  You may want to reconsider going on a date or anything further in the future.", "NTA\n\nThat's a big red flag.

You've been flirting, but you don't really know this man.  The first few dates should, generally, be in public places for everyone's safety.\n\nAnd really, do you want a date that is \"taking care of a sick dog\"?  \n\nThis is not the last chance ever for the two of you to go on a date.  As long as the two of you are alive, reasonably healthy, and still living in the same general area, there will be future opportunities.  It's very manipulative for him to suggest \"it's this or nothing.\"  \n\nAlso, if he's going to be leaving town and gone forever, so you can never, ever date again, is it worth your time to have a \"date\" that involves watching his sick dog?  If that is the case, this isn't a relationship that is going anywhere, so some fond memories of flirting with him will be something nice in the future, which an evening of sitting around watching a sick dog won't improve.  \n\nBut really, \"this is our ***last chance ever*** to go on a date\" is such a blatant lie that the only reasonable, appropriate or safe  response is \"that's too bad, I guess we're never going to date.\"  \n\nThere are lots of good fish in the sea.

Any decent person would understand not wanting to be alone with a new person. The fact that this guy is pushing it makes him seem significantly less safe to me. He\u2019s showing you his personality.

You dodged a bullet. He can't respect your \"no\", that's a big red flag.", "NTA feels like this bait and switch was intentional", "NTA\n\nHow do you not see all these red fla-- oh. You're 21. Okay, you're forgiven.\n\nThis is not a good person, OP.\n\nHe is 28, which may not seem that much older than you... but at that age it is a *huge* world of difference. He's taking advantage of your naivety as evidenced by the fact that you posted this, questioning yourself, instead of recognizing the issues and blocking his ass (I'm not blaming you - I'm blaming *him*)*.*\n\nNext, he's getting mad and browbeating you when you establish literally your first boundary. And it's a fine boundary to have. It's a good, safe, common boundary. But even if it weren't, his response is to show anger and try to bowl you over. Really not a good sign, even if the boundary were silly. Which it isn't.\n\nFurthermore, the boundary itself is a good one - you really shouldn't have a first date at his house, no matter what. The fact that he doesn't see that as good sense is extremely worrisome.\n\nNext, this asshole calls you \"ridiculous\". I think schoolyard insults demeaning your intelligence, thoughts, and feelings is a bridge too far, no?\n\nFinally, he's lying to you about timing. You are aware of the upcoming deadlines. Finding an hour sometime over the next two months (early December) to get coffee with someone is not an imposition in any world. I don't care how hard my dude works, he still needs to eat. If he wanted to, he knows (and you know) he could find time to grab a meal together. Why is he lying about this? Ah, to put more pressure on you.\n\n**RUN**.", "NTA - you\u2019re perfectly fine to keep yourself safe and have made your position clear.

So, if his dog is sick, wouldn't he be taking care of the dog?  **Doesn't make sense.**  \n\nYou repeated your decision, and he ***insulted you***.  **Red flag.**  \n\nHe argued that you wouldn't be able to reschedule, which ***you know is nonsense***.  **Red Flag.**  He was pressuring you again, with ***the idea that it's now or never.***  'Never' sounds more and more sensible, with his behavior and disrespect so far.\n\nWhen he still couldn't get you to comply, to change your decision and do what he wants, he ***called in a 'flying monkey' to gang up on you*** and tell you that you are wrong.  **Red Flag.** \n\nI'd let this one go.

A first date should be in a public area, him being this pushy about you going to his home on a first date is weird. He's also 28 and going for a 21 year old...

If you're OK waiting then you say \"Yeah, I'm not comfortable doing that yet, so I guess we'll have to wait if we can't find other times.\".  Either he'll make an effort, wait it out, or not.  But I'd cancel at this point if I were you.", "Always, always listen to your gut.", "NTA - if his argument is that you shouldn't reschedule because he won't have free time coming up , then what is the point of bothering with a 1st date because based on his argument - he wouldn't have free time coming up for additional dates. This guy is a d-bag.", "NTA - you are completely right to refuse. Firstly if this is the only time he is available for you then he is obviously not worth your time or effort and he also wouldn't have time for any further dates. Secondly you wanted a date and going round his place while he looks after his sick dog is not a date.\n\nTo be honest it sounds like he wanted an easy hookup without making any effort or spending any money which is why he was quite insistent that you go round there (and also feeding you the bullshit excuse that this would be the only time that he can see you). The fact that he's also bitching about you to a mutual friend confirms that you made the right choice. Stay clear of him.", "NTA. I had a guy i didn\u2019t know super well ask me out to dinner and the day of switched it up and insisted I go to his house. That was a hard no bc it raised red flags.

He should have just taken the no and said sure, if he actually liked you. NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA dude wanted you to come over for Netflix and chill (hookup).

He can be a decent guy, and honestly not having any ulterior motives for suggesting you come to his place, and you can be honestly cautious about going to the home of someone you don't know that well. \n\nAnd that's OK. The reason that I'm scoring you n t a and not n a h is that he's a 28 year old man - he should understand the reasonable caution that women can have about going to a guy's house for a date when they don't know him that well. So him calling you ridiculous earns him the AH points.\n\nBut do note that just because you think you'd have plenty of time to date during \"assignment season\" doesn't mean that he has the same opinion. He might think he won't have the time or the emotional energy to devote to a first date whilst he has assignments going on, and perhaps he's correct. You and he are different people, and don't have to have the same approach to your studies.", "NTA walk away. Y'all don't have time to meet up and that's okay. Entertain someone else.

Make surr you get seen several times in several places so people can identify you and remember you (if push comes to shove). Lastly, never let anyone pressure you for time, either it can wait or it will never happen. If the answer is no because it's inconvenient then that's thhe answer.", "NTA.

If a guy can\u2019t show you respect before your first date, it\u2019s downhill from there. \n\nMy husband offered to pick me up on our first date. I said no, I\u2019ll meet you at the restaurant, and he respected that. (I let him pick me up at my place after we had gone out several times, and felt comfortable with him knowing where I lived.)

He\u2019s using the dog to get you at his place then we all know what he\u2019s gonna try. If your not ready than don\u2019t go. You need to ask him what is the purpose of our relationship.

Is he actually 28 or is he just three toddlers in a trenchcoat?\n\nNTA, you dodged a bullet here. I personally wouldn\u2019t give this guy another chance, he hung his whole ass out there for you to see. He doesn\u2019t value you as anything beyond a quick bang and he won\u2019t hesitate to air dirty laundry to your friends if he doesn\u2019t approve of something you do.

I would lose his nimber as well.", "Totally agree", "This is why I always had \"First dates do not happen at home,\" in my dating profiles -- this is so common, it's boring, lazy, and unsafe.

OP, stick to your guns!", "Bingo and the few hours she spends at his house would equal the same amount of time he can go to a restaurant, park, movie, or anywhere for that matter", "Well said.

The only reason I go to these parties, is because I'm part of my student union and we throw a lot of them. I'm usually the one staying sober and making sure everyone is safe, has a great time, doesn't puke, can cry somewhere safely and gets home in one piece. You wouldn't believe how big of a part of my job it is to keep older students away from younger ones. Especially during freshers season (now.) We have a whole protocol centered just around \"Freshers hunting\" as we call it. It is disgusting.\n\nOP, honestly, better safe than sorry. Even if he didn't mean no harm, just don't risk it.", "He\u2019s at college parties because he\u2019s a college student. Not everyone enters college straight out of highschool. I don\u2019t disagree with your other reasoning but him being at a party with his classmates is normal.", "The fact that is is in college is a better indicator that he DOES belong at college parties. Some people take a different path through school (possibly he joined the military outnof high school, or possibly he was on a mission or possibly just switched his study path a bunch) but since they are in classes together that would indicate to me they are in the same stage of their life.", "Agree with you in almost everything, but what\u2019s wrong with going to parties at 28 if he\u2019s in college?", "Damn. I'm 24 and can't imagine being in colleges parties anymore. He's being a total creep and a just want to wet his duck. Dodge this bullet as fast as you can.", "THIS\n\nIt wasn't just pushing you, OP. He's *belittling* you. By calling your fears \"ridiculous\" he's handwaving you away. Your thoughts, feelings, opinions. They're ridiculous. I would actually be less angry if he just tried to say you were wrong. \n\nBy calling you \"ridiculous\" he removes the need to even address you as an equal, if that makes sense. I don't need to bother addressing the points made if they're \"ridiculous\". Like I don't argue with people who think the moon landing was fake. There's no need to reply because I call that opinion ridiculous and therefore I don't need to engage.\n\nSome men do this to women a lot, OP.", "i heard a saying recently: until it's no men, it's all men.", "That\u2019s a good point!

If you go 10 years later than everyone else that doesn\u2019t suddenly mean you fit in with the kids there when you\u2019re pushing 30.

There are other parties to go to with people his age, he doesn't have to go the ones with his classmates.", "I would say usually 28 year olds don't stumble at the same college parties as 21 year olds. If this is a second major or he started studying later he wouldn't be at all the parties because usually you are in a different phase in life. To me it feels like a hunting ground, it's full of 20-21 year olds, that would not be as hard to convince to go for a hook up. Men who don't date in their age range but go for much younger girls usually are not successful with their peers. \nSo him being at the party - nothing wrong in principle. Do I think he is a responsible and mature person in light of this? No. So if that person is asking me out to go to his house alone - nope.", "[deleted]", "Yup,  but then she says, \"I worry I overreacted\".\n\nNope, OP did not overreact.", "I was around that age when I could go to college.

Late 20's and early 20's isn't an odd mix to go to parties together.", "Friends are one thing, but guy is a pretty serious creep with trying to bully a woman 7 years younger than him to go to his house when she says no and then 'demands' a second opinion from their mutual friend? ffs. \"oh, no, I realize now I was being silly now that you've conferred with someone else about my discomfort.\"", "Yup, making friends when you're in a different stage of life is fine, no problem with that. Dating, though, is a marinara flag. It's not necessarily a complete showstopper - people can and do find love at 21/28 - but it needs to be discussed.", "Oh yeah, this is dude is a creep 100%. Just not being at the party imo haha."]}
