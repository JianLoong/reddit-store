After my jaw had healed, and  was unwired, the very first solid meal I ate was 2 bacon double cheeseburgers, which to this day was one of the best most pleasurable experiences of my life, being able to finally eat solid food and meat again after only liquids for 4 months. Well me and my gf (f24) have been dating for nearly three months when we finally had fun, afterwards she asked if it was everything I hoped it would be, was it a good time, worth the long wait, ect.. I responded with telling her that the 3 month wait and then finally having fun, was a similar but WAY better feeling than eating those cheeseburgers! She knows the backstory I've talked about it with her before, and I thought it would just be a funny compliment/comparison but she got very upset and said comparing us having fun to that moment is very disrespectful, and started saying she's not a piece of meat, ect. Like I said she asked me how it was and was it worth the wait, and I just thought it would be a funny similar comparison, I in no way compared her to meat, just that the build up and desire then finally getting what\n I/we wanted after such a long wait was an amazing feeling and that the experience felt similar to how I felt in that moment when finally eating that burger... idk, what do yall think, Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit 1. I should clarify this conversation happed days later while chatting and watching TV on the couch together, not right after the moment.\n\nEdit:1.5 lots of people asking why we waited 3 months, waited a few weeks cause we were freshly dating, planned on it around month mark but she ended up needing surgery and was unable for for about another 2 months while healing. \n\nEdit:2 some people don't get what I meant, with my comparison, what I rlly meant was like the waiting, longing for something for so long, wanting it everyday but cant, and then finally received it makes it that much better. Like that cheeseburger wasn't ant better than any other random cheeseburgers I've had in the past, the build up waiting then finaly having it made it that much better like 100x better, and that's what feeling I meant to compare to her, when she asked was it worth the wait and was it everything I wanted it to be. He'll I've had (fun) plenty of times in the past but what made it so special with her was the desire and finally satisfying that desire, wanting her so badly for so long, and having fun was euphoria just like that exp was similar to how I felt eating the burger.\n\nAlso, some people keep mentioning to apologize, Already have and she won't accept it and wants me to apologize for the \"right reason\" which means admit that her interpretation is what I meant and apologize for that, and I won't apologize for feeling a way I didn't and still don't. I've tried explaining and she doesn't understand it. Idk what to do, I'm deff not gonna validate her opinion by lying to her and admit that's rlly how I felt and apologize for something that isn't true.

You were just being funny. That\u2019s aggravating that she twisted ur words.

I\u2019m a woman, and (knowing the backstory), I\u2019d have taken that as a *huge* compliment. I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019s being sensitive and weird about it. I generally don\u2019t like to overreact, but you might be cautious with this person, going forward. If she flips out over something so incredibly simple, what\u2019s she going to do when there is a serious issue at hand? Good luck.", "NTA. As someone who experienced a similar thing in high school where I couldn't eat anything solid for an extended period of time due to health reasons -- this is cute and absolutely the perfect comparison. \n\nAs a woman, I can understand why she might be upset if she has never gone through something similar. She thinks you are looking at her as just something you can bite into basically, lol. She wants you to put yalls sex above a cheeseburger.

She\u2019s reading wayyyy too much into it.", "NTA, and here is why:\n\nNever, and I mean NEVER, apologize for how you feel. Your girlfriend should NEVER invalidate your feelings. You feel what you feel, and there is no shame in that.  NTA. She needs to apologize to you, or at the very least, admit that she over-reacted.", "NTA.

Your gf is very sensitive about it. Did you ask why? NAH.", "NTA. You guys must be really boring though if it took you that long to have fun. Damn.\n\n(You've done all that you can reasonably do. You've explained yourself. She can believe that or not and then she can decide what to do from there. If she breaks up with you over that then I dunno what to say other than you probably dodged a bullet.)", "I think your GF is being overly sensitive but there's clearly a reason she waited so long before giving the green light for the horizontal gymnastics to start (Three months?! I only had to wait three dates but that was forty years ago so maybe things were different then). \n\nAnyway, if I had said something like that to my (then) GF, she would have acted shocked and outraged, said \"Thank you very much!!!\" rather indignantly and then laughed. I would never have been allowed to forget it though.\n\nIt sounds like intimacy is something your GF really treasures and values so, that being the case, being 'compared to' a cheeseburger probably stung a bit. \n\nNTA at all here OP but I do hope your GF develops a bit of a sense of humour in the near future. And, perhaps, becomes a bit less sensitive. I'm sure she's otherwise a gem.\n\nA word of caution from an old stager to a younger man. Whether you are right or not is immaterial. \n\nI have been married for a very long time and I have learnt that keeping my wife happy (within reason of course, I'm not a doormat) is a short route to keeping me happy. If I need to apologise for something, even if I know myself to be right from all available evidence, I will do so as otherwise these things fester. Choose your battles. This ain't one of them even if it was funny and made me laugh.\n\nFinal thought. She made you wait three months before getting frisky so obviously she is happy to go without for that long. Maybe longer. If you don't sort this out, you ain't getting any until next summer. \n\nGood luck!", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't matter what we say. She told you how she felt about it.

I should've done better. I'll make sure not to make a comparison like that again.\" \n\nI've had trouble making these sorts of apologies. Because \"I did nothing wrong.\" *Except I did do something wrong.* After my partner opened up to me about their hurt, I rushed to defend myself, instead of attending to their feelings.\n\nCause we're supposed to be a team, yeah?

I was like I'm sorry I didn't explain well enough when I made the comparison and maybe left room for misinterpretation but this is what I meant and she keeps saying I'm only saying that because I won't admit what I rlly meant and felt. I'm just at a loss for words at this point.", "If it doesn't matter , then why did you include it .\n\n\"this isn\u2019t the type of joke you crack right after an intimate moment in which she was vulnerable with you.\"\n\nBecause it did matter matter when it was said.", "I have and even explained what I meant, but she's twisting it into all these comparisons and jumping to stuff I never even Said or meant. Like she's not meat, she's not something to be used for few mins then be done with like a burger all these wierd things I never said. And no matter what I say she's still mad, she almost wants me to admit to that I meant those things which I clearly didn't.", "I wasn't comparing being with her to the cheeseburger, I was comparing the waiting and built up desire and final release when you have what u waited for. I wasn't saying oh are fun, was like a burger, was comparing the wait and then finally getting what u have been waiting for for so long.", "Haha ok lol, but one thing I was explaining to another commenter is, what I rlly meant was like the waiting, longing for something for so long, wanting it everyday but cant, and then finally received it makes it that much better. Like that cheeseburger wasn't ant better than any other random cheeseburgers I've had in the past, the build up waiting then finaly having it made it that much better like 100x better, and that's what feeling I meant to compare to her, when she asked was it worth the wait and was it everything I wanted it to be. He'll I've had (fun) plenty of times in the past but what made it so special with her was the desire and finally satisfying that desire, and wanting it for momths with her because i care so much about her. as similar to how I felt eating the burger, that the only similarity I meant, but somehow she's like I'm not meat, I'm not something to fill your craving, I'm not to be used for 10 mins of pleasure like a burger. Ect things I never said, I only meant to compare the waiting, desire then getting it feeling makes it so much better. But yea...", "I mean, it's definitely the kind of thing that *could* be hurtful, depending on the context. And you have my sympathy if you have accidentally hurt someone that way. \n\nBut I would say that in the context OP presents, he isn't personally an asshole. The comparison is between the emotional responses to the situations, which were reasonably similar, rather than her to the burgers themselves. And it sounds like she should have all the info she needs to understand that. \n\nAgain, I am sorry about your situation though. I hope you are able to make things right.", "Well did you try coitus? \ud83d\udd96\ud83c\udffb", "It was a joke because you couldn\u2019t say what it was. Violence isn\u2019t allowed but I read sex here all the time.", "That was funny man. My wife and I have said and compared far worse to each other in a joking manner. I can\u2019t imagine being with someone who wouldn\u2019t see that as an obvious funny compliment. My wife giggled when I told her the line and said it was sweet. Just figured you should know", "Tell her to get over herself. Her magic sex isn't better than a good cheeseburger that you ate AFTER STARVING FOR 4 MONTHS. \n\nI starved for 6 months and I would straight up tell my bf: \"Yeah that Mexican food plate I had when I got better was on par with our sex.\" And he would take it as a compliment. \n\nAgain, I'm not trying to tell her how to feel, but she's being unreasonable about this particular thing at this point. Maybe there's something else bothering her? Idk.", "It's not on her to decide you meant something completely different to what you actually meant?? When you explain it, it sounds so innocent. She's hurt and trying to continue to justify that hurt even after you've explained to her what you *truly* meant. She's grasping at the straw of \"no that isn't what you meant\" because if she doesn't, she isn't justified in feeling hurt about what you said.\n\nYou admitted what you meant, she doesn't like your version of events so is making up her own. She sounds incredibly immature, I'm so sorry she's not listening to you about this. You're NTA and she's being a pretty big one here, I'd be tempted to show her this post and some of the comments on it to get her to understand that she's told herself a lie when you're telling her the truth of it all.", "Yea I kinda feel the same way, like timing and context matters. Clearly I wouldn't crack a joke in the moment I just mentioned days later when she asked, that it reminded me of that feeling of waiting then finally getting what u waited for was worth the wait and then some cause it made it feel so much better, going without said thing for so long and it reminded me of that amazing feeling.  And for lack of better terms, I don't mean *get* but u know what i mean.", "Whatever. You know what the problem is and yet you're on here flailing around. \n\nGrow up.", "Thank you so much. That's very kind of you. \n\nAs far as OP's gf.... It sounds like she's bent it completely out of shape and is putting words in OP's mouth. All in all, she's the AH in this larger situation, no doubt.\n\nBut I think what I've learned is: making any sort of comparison/simile/metaphor/equivalence between *food* and *someone that you love* might be disrespectful. It depends. Also, I now suspect that the likelihood of really hurting someone is much higher than I ever thought. ... Had I even stopped to think about it.\n\nNot trying to judge anyone else, BTW. If someone knows the joke will be well received and no one will get hurt, that's great. \n\nThanks for listening.", "No lol", "He\u2019s efficient, and thorough", "Oh lol", "Thank u. And yea I'm thinking it's not gonna work with her.", "Yea Idk. I feel like something else is going on and she's using this as a reason to get upset or something, it feels like she's picking a fight idk it's so wierd.", "Yes because I am giving you a charitable interpretation because that's how normal people are.", "You sound miserable.", "Awwww, did some get their feelings hurt vicariously?", "You really sound like OP's GF here, misinterpreting what he's saying and explaining to you because you *think* he actually meant it *this way* despite. Yanno. That not being the case.", "I was in a relationship prior to meeting my wife where I had to walk on eggshells in fear of upsetting her. It was a miserable 4 years. Do what you gotta do man.", "Honestly, she just sounds kind of immature at best. Manipulative at absolute worst.", "Honestly, this would be red flag behavior for me. I don't like my partners making absolutes about what my words mean after I've already tried having an adult conversation with them about how something I said made them feel. \n\nHas there been similar behavior in the past?", "Yea", "Yea", "Yea same for me, and no their hasn't that's why all this is so wierd and sudden. The last 2 months or so, she's been healing from a surgery and everything was going good, but then all this happens and I'm at a loss for words."]}
