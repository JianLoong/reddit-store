My wife was okay with it and so was the rest of her family. \n\nI personally felt uncomfortable with it because my son is a young baby and I just feel like doing that type of thing puts our baby\u2019s safety at risk. So we went up the escalator with my wife\u2019s dad holding the stroller on the escalator. Everything was fine everyone was safe. \n\nNow we had a convo about the situation after and I said that when it comes to a situation where our baby\u2019s safety is at risk she needs to make sure that both of us are on board with it. She argued that she used to see her parents do that escalator trick all the time with her younger sisters and it was okay. I told her it does not matter what her parents did with their kids this is our kid. She argued that she did not see this as a situation where she needed to consult me. \n\nNow I did agree that next time I should speak up but should she have consulted me if it was okay for her family to just take our baby up on the escalator without both of us being okay with it?\n\nThe compromise I\u2019m asking for is that when it comes to our baby\u2019s safety both of us need to be on board. \n\nWho is the A hole? Should my wife have consulted me? Should my wife have more alarms going off in her head when it comes to little situations such as these? Should I have just spoken up or should my wife not even put me in an uncomfortable situation with her side of the family in the first place?

You were right there and have your own voice.", "Yta because you expected your wife to read your mind. You were \"uncomfortable\" but you didn't object.  I actually agree with you about strollers and escalators being a no because it IS a safety issue.its not technically illegal but it's not recommended. You could have been polite but firm. No sorry I am not comfortable with that and scooped the baby out of the pram or commandeered the stroller. When it comes to anything you believe to be a safety issue you speak up immediately. Everytime.  don't concern yourself about  if the inlaws think you are paranoid or overly cautious. They raised their kids in a different time and era where safety standards were lax or nonexistant. And as you stated this is YOUR child. Also... Google escalators and prams.", "YTA. You were there; that was the time to speak up. This 'consultation' stuff is nonsense; if you think there is a risk, you speak up at the time. Don't wait around for your wife to 'consult' with you.\n\nRisk is subjective; you are not always going to be on the same page. It doesn't mean your wife should have 'more alarms going off in her head' nor does it mean you're paranoid.", "YTA for not saying anything and going along with it if your issue is this big", "Yeah it's not about your concern for the baby's safety (which is valid).\n\nIt's about you telling your wife she has to consult you FIRST. Nope.\n\nYou basically told her she can't make parenting decisions without you. And on a macro level, you insulted her as a mother.\n\nWhere is the line? Should she consult you before sending the kid down a slide? On the monkey bars? Should she shoot you a text before getting a balloon (aka a floating choke-trap) from the grocery store? What about when a sweet old lady at church wants to hold the baby but *your wife doesn't know this lady's vaccination records??* \n\nMy point is that hazards are everywhere, your wife is an adult *and a mother* and you need to trust her to navigate the world and its many dangers without intentionally putting the baby at risk. \n\nIn a situation where you perceive a risk that she does not, discuss it respectfully. (Unless the baby is, like, hurtling top speed in a runaway buggy towards traffic.)\n\nPutting your foot down on safety issues is one thing, but you could have done it in a way that didn't insult your postpartum wife. \n\nYTA for how you addressed it.", "Ok I understand your concern.  So state it as a concern, you don't want that to happen again and let that be it.  Be done with it.  Your reaction is way over the top.  Not everything is  so egregious that it required hours long discussion and arguing.

I don't think you're unreasonable to be worried about the safety risk. And I don't think she was unreasonable for not seeing it. I do think it's a little unreasonable to be mad that she didn't check with you first, simply because she didn't think it was dangerous. If she had considered it to be dangerous, and not consulted you, then you'd have a point. But you were standing right there, while they made the decision, and didn't interject in any way. She was right that it was on you to comment, as she wasn't seeing the danger.", "NAH.  You wife did not feel uncomfortable about it and you did.   If she saw no threat then she would not have thought to talk to you about it.   You should have just spoke up and simply said I will carry the baby or take the elevator.   In time you guys will work these things out but not if you both do not communicate the next time something happens", "NAH. The two of you had differing thoughts on the safety of the escalator, no problem there. Your wife isn't a telepath, and you didn't say anything, so the situation continued on as it was. You aren't asking for anything unreasonable going forward, your wife wasn't unreasonable to expect you to speak up if you had a concern. However, you may need to be prepared to speak up more than you would think, because for her to think to ask you if you think a situation is safe she is going to need to consider it unsafe herself.", "NTA but just pick the baby up out of the stroller and carry the baby up the escalator", "Honestly? I have to give this one a NAH. It sounds like the danger genuinely didn't occur to your wife because taking strollers on escalators has been normalized for her. I don't agree with her, but I have a hard time calling her an AH for simply not realizing something, especially since the person with the safety concern (you) didn't speak up in the moment.\n\nHowever, I'm not going to call you an AH either. Having the baby in the stroller on the escalator IS a safety risk. It may not be the biggest craziest risk you could take, but you're not wrong to be concerned about it. And it sounds as if you raised it in an appropriate conversational way with your wife.\n\nFor me this is not an AH situation, it's a \"let's learn from this and do better in the future\" situation.", "NAH. The worst risk of escalators is getting clothing or hair caught in the mechanism. The next worst is having the stroller in front of you (if it's a down escalator) and then losing your grip, possibly because of an emergency stop. If you always stand between the abyss and the stroller, it should be quite safe. But in doubt, take baby out of the stroller, go on the escalator with an empty stroller and put baby in the stroller once you're at your destination.\n\nJust feeling that your baby is at risk is a good reason to have a second look at the situation. But expecting your wife to see the same risks that you do is a bit too much - she has other experiences and knowledge and might well not consider this a problem worthy of consultation. There's a film titled The Elevator, once you've seen that you might consider the elevator a worse risk :-)", "ESH - you're right, on both counts. First it IS unsafe and you should have waited for the elevator. Whatever is on the next floor up can't be THAT urgent that a few extra seconds will be catastrophic. And she SHOULD have consulted you. It's not her fathers baby, it's your and her baby. You need to be communicating about these things. \n\nWhich brings me to you. You didn't communicate your discomfort and by not doing so implied you were OK with it to everyone. Communication takes two, and you failed to speak up, in defense of your baby.", "NAH. How was he supposed to know you and your wife weren\u2019t both ok with it if you didn\u2019t say anything? How was your wife supposed to know you wanted to be consulted, when she clearly thinks of it as a normal thing to do *and you didn\u2019t say anything *?", "YTA for allowing it to happen and THEN trying to be upset about it.  \n\nI have personally witnessed a baby being dropped out of a stroller on an escalator, it was not a good time for anyone. \n\n Why didn't someone just hold the baby?   You don't get to go along with things and then act like you were overridden.", "Nobody is an asshole, first parent jitters are normal. In the UK there\u2019s signs saying not to take pushchairs on the escalators so I understand your concerns, but I\u2019ve also done it when the lift was broke.", "NAH, you're a new parent and you're terrified.

Security would also keep an eye on it. One day there was an accident. Pram rolled down and to the side, knocking down people in front of it\u2026mum tried to grab it and end up falling and hitting her face (right in her eye with the pram\u2019s handle) and the gran that was with them,who had the other child with her,started having chest pain. Baby needed sutures on her forehead. The other child had no one from her family to comfort her and reassure her. Mum had lots of blood in her eye socket. Gran had to be taken to the hospital because she was having a heart attack.\nOP you\u2019re NTA.

From your wife\u2019s perspective this situation was not a huge deal (as a Mom of 4... I agree). From your perspective you believed it\u2019s a safety risk. Is it worth an argument? No. Will there need to be a discussion every time someone has concerns? No. Either you\u2019re going to trust each other or your not. If it\u2019s that important to you then speak up. Having a difference of opinion does not mean either of you are assholes.\n\nDo you honestly believe any of your family would put your child at risk?

However, if you\u2019re concerned about their actions then tell them.\n\neta \u2014 instead of worrying about who is right or wrong in every situation ... just solve the problem.

Fold it and transport it while someone holds the baby.", "While I understand the desire to keep the baby safe at all times, you need to calm down.

Of course your wife should discuss safety matters with you but it\u2019s an escalator? It\u2019s really not so serious.", "NAH not everyone sees risks in the same activities, and reasonable people can disagree about the perfect degree of caution. It's especially tough to disagree about something as important as keeping a baby safe. It sounds like you guys are surrounded by love and support and are open and loving with each other, an excellent head start! The rest takes patience and practice", "NTA. As parents, it's crucial to prioritize our baby's safety. Communication is key, and both of you should be on the same page when it comes to risky situations. Remember,  it's not about who did what with younger siblings, but about what makes you both comfortable as parents. Ironing out these parenting details can be a challenge, but it's great that you're open to learning and finding common ground.", "Soft YTA. You are very much over reacting. Everyone takes the escalator with a stroller. It\u2019s not unsafe at all, and you shaming your wife for \u00ab\u00a0putting you baby in danger\u00a0\u00bb was out of line. You need to learn to relax if you don\u2019t want to become a helicopter parent.", "NTA Baby\u2019s safety should always take priority over convenience. Escalators weren\u2019t designed to accommodate prams, which means using them with a pram puts your baby at risk of an injury.", "NTA. Escalators have rules for a reason.\n\nNot pram-related, but this story will give you an idea of the brainless things people do on and around escalators.\n\nI was standing on an escalator heading downwards. I always make sure there's at least one empty step between me and the person in front. If possible, I leave a few steps empty. But even so, it was a busy railway station, and the escalator was fairly crowded and moving fast. The woman a couple of steps in front of me was carrying several shopping bags.\n\nI had almost reached the lower level, the woman in front of me stepped off - and dropped one of her shopping bags. She stopped dead in her tracks, tried to pick it up - and promptly dropped two more bags. She went to pick those one up too. **She and her bags were now entirely blocking the exit of this fast-moving escalator.**\n\nIn my loudest, angriest voice, I yelled \"GET OUT OF THE WAY!\"\n\nShe yelped, shot a glance over her shoulder at the column of people headed by me who were about to land right on top of her, and scuttled out of the way. I stepped off the escalator, dodged around one of her bags, kicked it to buggery, stepped aside, and as quickly as I could, I picked up her shopping and shit and flung it aside so that the people coming off the escalator wouldn't trip over it or get tangled up in it. I didn't give a shit where it landed or what fell out of the bags. I was so fucking angry at her stupidity.\n\nShe didn't say boo. She just meekly gathered up her stuff. I think she was shocked by how close she had come to causing a major accident.\n\nThis happened years ago. I am now physically disabled, and I avoid escalators unless I have no alternative. I cannot move fast enough any more to dodge blockages at the bottom of the escalator. If this incident had happened today, I'd have been badly injured, and so probably would have been many of the people behind me.\n\nThat is an example of how quickly, how easily, something can go terribly wrong on an escalator. It only takes a few seconds.", "Your not over thinking it. \n\nMy best friend went up with her 3month old baby. \nSomeone pushed passed her and she accidentally let go of the pram her daughter was in PICU for two weeks.\nUnfortunately she doesn't have a live daughter anymore.\n\nShe has not forgiven herself because she always says if I just waited for the lift my child would still be here.\n\nNTA", "YTA and you need to trust your partner can decide what is and isn\u2019t safe for the newborn without your input.", "NAH.\n\nTo be clear, you were unreasonable but not TA.\n\nThe baby is only a month old, and it's natural for new parents to be nervous, but lighten up.

It also sounds like her and her parents have more experience with kids. \n\nI\u2019m going to say YTA because you seem to be making a big deal out of nothing and I think you should apologize to your wife for implying that she was being careless about your child\u2019s safety when she wasn\u2019t", "ESH but kind of soft. The safety of the baby is each parent\u2019s responsibility, and you don\u2019t get a free pass because mom thought it was ok. She learned a bad habit from her parents who did a poor risk assessment. A lot of kids are put into dangerous situations by caretakers that don\u2019t realize the danger, so that\u2019s one reason I say soft. OP, you knew the danger but said nothing. I say soft ESH overall because the baby was fine, but if they got hurt it would be obvious that every adult involved was an AH.", "NTA but if you\u2019re going to be particular about something I recommend just doing it yourself.  Saves a bunch of hassle.\n\n\u201cHey FIL, I\u2019m going to steer Jr around for a bit.  See you upstairs shortly\u201d \n\nAnd then use the elevator.\n\nBtw I agree with you.  Don\u2019t take a stroller up an escalator.  That\u2019s not proper use.", "It takes literally 1 minute for an elevator........ Impatience is wild to me...", "There is a reason why strollers with the baby inside aren't safe in escalators. Escalators are notoriously known to go down due anything and I mean anything or how many times it needs to be stopped due to heels getting in, dresses, papers, etc. What if the person in front of you drops something and jams the escalator by trying to grab back \n\nWhen an escalator is suddenly stopped it is where the baby or a kid on their parents shoulders are at risk. Those save measures are there for a reason to keep your child safe. One thing is you are carrying the baby while someone else holds the stroller but leaving the baby/kid inside is nuts and a risk that you shouldn't take.\n\nI work with conventions/event center and all the mentioned above happens all the time, with people sometimes getting seriously hurt. I wasn't anywhere an escalator would cause many incidents and injuries until I started working at this place.\n\nEdit: YTA for not speaking up. This is your kid after all man.", "YTA. Speak up. She\u2019s a not a mind reader.", "NTA for having boundaries, but YTA for being mad at your wife because YOU didn't say anything.  Use your words to make your feelings known.  Staying quiet and then blaming other because they didn't read your mind is always AH territory.", "NTA That was definitely not a good idea, if management saw that they would have been upset. That is very dangerous!!!!!!!", "\nIn no way should she consult you for every safety decision just like you won\u2019t consult her. Now is a good time to set some boundaries. What are your hard no\u2019s? Leaving the baby in a car alone- hard no. Giving baby chocolate milk in their bottle-hard No. You can\u2019t possibly know every situation so you have to trust her judgment just like she should trust yours. \n\nSoft YTA because you both need to communicate.", "**YTA**. Your wife doesn't need to consult you with everything as if she's the child. She's the mother, able to make plenty of decisions without you. \n\n>should my wife not even put me in an uncomfortable situation with her side of the family in the first place?\n\nHow would she know you were uncomfortable? You just stood there and went along with it, so of course she would assume you were okay. Passive-aggressive, \"how dare you not read my mind and consult with me when I assume you should consult with me\" is rubbish\n\nDevelop some respect for your wife as an adult and full-fledged parent.", "YTA\n\nYour wife and you are going to disagree about what is safe or unsafe when it comes to your kids. This was just the first of many of these disagreements. \n\nYou need to speak up and say \u201chey this doesn\u2019t feel safe to me.\u201d I guarantee your wife wasn\u2019t thinking \u201clet\u2019s do something unsafe with my newborn child.\u201d She was thinking, \u201coh right the escalator trick, I remember that from when I was a kid.\u201d The fact that you might think it was unsafe likely never occurred to her. \n\nAlso, she\u2019s going to do things you disagree with when it is just her and the kiddos. Most of these will be things that y\u2019all just haven\u2019t discussed. You need to trust her judgement. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t discuss after the fact that you are uncomfortable with say kiddo running on the walking path near the lake, but you can\u2019t get bent out of shape about it.", "YTA not because you didn\u2019t feel safe having the baby on the escalator, but because you assumed your wife has the exact same perspective on what potential safety issues are that you do. Clearly it didn\u2019t occur to her that it\u2019s an issue because she grew up with this happening safely. There are probably things you will do that are second nature that will freak her out. You\u2019re both getting the hang of this but can\u2019t expect to read each other\u2019s minds.", "OP, I was at JFK Airport, traveling on the escalator, the woman in front tripped at the top, making me and BF trip and fall, people were literally walking over the fallen as the chaos spread.\n\nEscalators are not safe for strollers. STOP.\n\nNTA - but, next time, speak up.", "Plenty of parents and other caregivers take their strollers on escalators without incident. I'm not sure why the OP expected his wife to magically know he thought it was too unsafe and something they needed to decide on together.", "Why not just take baby out and hold baby to use escalator.", "You're actually wrong. The incidence of serious injuries/deaths on escalators are higher for children than adults. And escalators are not designed to be used with prams. The strollers don't fit so you are holding them off balance with a living being that you supposedly care about inside. Try researching a bit. Most escalator injuries stem from falls. The original fall itself can be dangerous but getting entangled in the grates and moving machinery treads is bad. When adults fall they can catch themselves when they fall, their extremities are also larger  and less likely to be entrapped etc they are less likely to stick their fingers against the mechanisms. I wouldn't even take a young child on an escalator. Do you know what those things can do to a child? I saw a young kids fingers get mangled when they fell and the machine kind of \"sucked the fingers in\" (I don't know how to describe it better but it was horrific)  Nope. Nope. nope.", "Son**", "They literally put signs on escalators telling you not to take strollers on them! It\u2019s incredibly dangerous! OP and the rest of his family endangered their baby! Him by not protesting and them by ignoring every escalator sign ever!", "I'm not saying it's a perfectly safe option. More that it's done commonly enough without problem that he cannot expect his wife to know/suspect how he feels. \n\nNot every escalator has that type of sign either. I can't remember seeing one, including on the  escalator I used today.", "Remind me to never let you babysit anyone ever.", "No", "If I had the option to use an elevator, I would absolutely choose that. But sure, take my comments however you please."]}
