So we went up the escalator with my wife\u2019s dad holding the stroller on the escalator. Everything was fine everyone was safe. \n\nNow we had a convo about the situation after and I said that when it comes to a situation where our baby\u2019s safety is at risk she needs to make sure that both of us are on board with it. She argued that she used to see her parents do that escalator trick all the time with her younger sisters and it was okay. I told her it does not matter what her parents did with their kids this is our kid. She argued that she did not see this as a situation where she needed to consult me. \n\nNow I did agree that next time I should speak up but should she have consulted me if it was okay for her family to just take our baby up on the escalator without both of us being okay with it?\n\nThe compromise I\u2019m asking for is that when it comes to our baby\u2019s safety both of us need to be on board. \n\nWho is the A hole? Should my wife have consulted me? Should my wife have more alarms going off in her head when it comes to little situations such as these? Should I have just spoken up or should my wife not even put me in an uncomfortable situation with her side of the family in the first place?

You were right there and have your own voice.", "Yta because you expected your wife to read your mind. You were \"uncomfortable\" but you didn't object.  I actually agree with you about strollers and escalators being a no because it IS a safety issue.its not technically illegal but it's not recommended. You could have been polite but firm. No sorry I am not comfortable with that and scooped the baby out of the pram or commandeered the stroller. When it comes to anything you believe to be a safety issue you speak up immediately. Everytime.  don't concern yourself about  if the inlaws think you are paranoid or overly cautious. They raised their kids in a different time and era where safety standards were lax or nonexistant. And as you stated this is YOUR child. Also... Google escalators and prams.", "YTA. You were there; that was the time to speak up. This 'consultation' stuff is nonsense; if you think there is a risk, you speak up at the time. Don't wait around for your wife to 'consult' with you.\n\nRisk is subjective; you are not always going to be on the same page. It doesn't mean your wife should have 'more alarms going off in her head' nor does it mean you're paranoid.", "YTA for not saying anything and going along with it if your issue is this big", "Yeah it's not about your concern for the baby's safety (which is valid).\n\nIt's about you telling your wife she has to consult you FIRST. Nope.\n\nYou basically told her she can't make parenting decisions without you. And on a macro level, you insulted her as a mother.\n\nWhere is the line? Should she consult you before sending the kid down a slide? On the monkey bars? Should she shoot you a text before getting a balloon (aka a floating choke-trap) from the grocery store? What about when a sweet old lady at church wants to hold the baby but *your wife doesn't know this lady's vaccination records??* \n\nMy point is that hazards are everywhere, your wife is an adult *and a mother* and you need to trust her to navigate the world and its many dangers without intentionally putting the baby at risk. \n\nIn a situation where you perceive a risk that she does not, discuss it respectfully. (Unless the baby is, like, hurtling top speed in a runaway buggy towards traffic.)\n\nPutting your foot down on safety issues is one thing, but you could have done it in a way that didn't insult your postpartum wife. \n\nYTA for how you addressed it.", "Ok I understand your concern.  So state it as a concern, you don't want that to happen again and let that be it.  Be done with it.  Your reaction is way over the top.  Not everything is  so egregious that it required hours long discussion and arguing.

I don't think you're unreasonable to be worried about the safety risk. And I don't think she was unreasonable for not seeing it. I do think it's a little unreasonable to be mad that she didn't check with you first, simply because she didn't think it was dangerous. If she had considered it to be dangerous, and not consulted you, then you'd have a point. But you were standing right there, while they made the decision, and didn't interject in any way. She was right that it was on you to comment, as she wasn't seeing the danger.", "NAH.  You wife did not feel uncomfortable about it and you did.   If she saw no threat then she would not have thought to talk to you about it.   You should have just spoke up and simply said I will carry the baby or take the elevator.   In time you guys will work these things out but not if you both do not communicate the next time something happens", "NAH. The two of you had differing thoughts on the safety of the escalator, no problem there. Your wife isn't a telepath, and you didn't say anything, so the situation continued on as it was. You aren't asking for anything unreasonable going forward, your wife wasn't unreasonable to expect you to speak up if you had a concern. However, you may need to be prepared to speak up more than you would think, because for her to think to ask you if you think a situation is safe she is going to need to consider it unsafe herself.", "NTA but just pick the baby up out of the stroller and carry the baby up the escalator", "Honestly? I have to give this one a NAH. It sounds like the danger genuinely didn't occur to your wife because taking strollers on escalators has been normalized for her. I don't agree with her, but I have a hard time calling her an AH for simply not realizing something, especially since the person with the safety concern (you) didn't speak up in the moment.\n\nHowever, I'm not going to call you an AH either. Having the baby in the stroller on the escalator IS a safety risk. It may not be the biggest craziest risk you could take, but you're not wrong to be concerned about it. And it sounds as if you raised it in an appropriate conversational way with your wife.\n\nFor me this is not an AH situation, it's a \"let's learn from this and do better in the future\" situation.", "NAH. The worst risk of escalators is getting clothing or hair caught in the mechanism. The next worst is having the stroller in front of you (if it's a down escalator) and then losing your grip, possibly because of an emergency stop. If you always stand between the abyss and the stroller, it should be quite safe. But in doubt, take baby out of the stroller, go on the escalator with an empty stroller and put baby in the stroller once you're at your destination.\n\nJust feeling that your baby is at risk is a good reason to have a second look at the situation. But expecting your wife to see the same risks that you do is a bit too much - she has other experiences and knowledge and might well not consider this a problem worthy of consultation. There's a film titled The Elevator, once you've seen that you might consider the elevator a worse risk :-)", "ESH - you're right, on both counts. First it IS unsafe and you should have waited for the elevator. Whatever is on the next floor up can't be THAT urgent that a few extra seconds will be catastrophic. And she SHOULD have consulted you. It's not her fathers baby, it's your and her baby. You need to be communicating about these things. \n\nWhich brings me to you. You didn't communicate your discomfort and by not doing so implied you were OK with it to everyone. Communication takes two, and you failed to speak up, in defense of your baby.", "NAH. How was he supposed to know you and your wife weren\u2019t both ok with it if you didn\u2019t say anything? How was your wife supposed to know you wanted to be consulted, when she clearly thinks of it as a normal thing to do *and you didn\u2019t say anything *?", "YTA for allowing it to happen and THEN trying to be upset about it.  \n\nI have personally witnessed a baby being dropped out of a stroller on an escalator, it was not a good time for anyone. \n\n Why didn't someone just hold the baby?   You don't get to go along with things and then act like you were overridden.", "Nobody is an asshole, first parent jitters are normal. In the UK there\u2019s signs saying not to take pushchairs on the escalators so I understand your concerns, but I\u2019ve also done it when the lift was broke.", "NAH, you're a new parent and you're terrified.

Security would also keep an eye on it. One day there was an accident. Pram rolled down and to the side, knocking down people in front of it\u2026mum tried to grab it and end up falling and hitting her face (right in her eye with the pram\u2019s handle) and the gran that was with them,who had the other child with her,started having chest pain. Baby needed sutures on her forehead. The other child had no one from her family to comfort her and reassure her. Mum had lots of blood in her eye socket. Gran had to be taken to the hospital because she was having a heart attack.\nOP you\u2019re NTA.

From your wife\u2019s perspective this situation was not a huge deal (as a Mom of 4... I agree). From your perspective you believed it\u2019s a safety risk. Is it worth an argument? No. Will there need to be a discussion every time someone has concerns? No. Either you\u2019re going to trust each other or your not. If it\u2019s that important to you then speak up. Having a difference of opinion does not mean either of you are assholes.\n\nDo you honestly believe any of your family would put your child at risk?

However, if you\u2019re concerned about their actions then tell them.\n\neta \u2014 instead of worrying about who is right or wrong in every situation ... just solve the problem.

Fold it and transport it while someone holds the baby.", "While I understand the desire to keep the baby safe at all times, you need to calm down.

Of course your wife should discuss safety matters with you but it\u2019s an escalator? It\u2019s really not so serious.", "NAH not everyone sees risks in the same activities, and reasonable people can disagree about the perfect degree of caution. It's especially tough to disagree about something as important as keeping a baby safe. It sounds like you guys are surrounded by love and support and are open and loving with each other, an excellent head start! The rest takes patience and practice", "NTA. As parents, it's crucial to prioritize our baby's safety. Communication is key, and both of you should be on the same page when it comes to risky situations. Remember,  it's not about who did what with younger siblings, but about what makes you both comfortable as parents. Ironing out these parenting details can be a challenge, but it's great that you're open to learning and finding common ground.", "Soft YTA. You are very much over reacting. Everyone takes the escalator with a stroller. It\u2019s not unsafe at all, and you shaming your wife for \u00ab\u00a0putting you baby in danger\u00a0\u00bb was out of line. You need to learn to relax if you don\u2019t want to become a helicopter parent.", "NTA Baby\u2019s safety should always take priority over convenience. Escalators weren\u2019t designed to accommodate prams, which means using them with a pram puts your baby at risk of an injury.", "NTA. Escalators have rules for a reason.\n\nNot pram-related, but this story will give you an idea of the brainless things people do on and around escalators.\n\nI was standing on an escalator heading downwards. I always make sure there's at least one empty step between me and the person in front. If possible, I leave a few steps empty. But even so, it was a busy railway station, and the escalator was fairly crowded and moving fast. The woman a couple of steps in front of me was carrying several shopping bags.\n\nI had almost reached the lower level, the woman in front of me stepped off - and dropped one of her shopping bags. She stopped dead in her tracks, tried to pick it up - and promptly dropped two more bags. She went to pick those one up too. **She and her bags were now entirely blocking the exit of this fast-moving escalator.**\n\nIn my loudest, angriest voice, I yelled \"GET OUT OF THE WAY!\"\n\nShe yelped, shot a glance over her shoulder at the column of people headed by me who were about to land right on top of her, and scuttled out of the way. I stepped off the escalator, dodged around one of her bags, kicked it to buggery, stepped aside, and as quickly as I could, I picked up her shopping and shit and flung it aside so that the people coming off the escalator wouldn't trip over it or get tangled up in it. I didn't give a shit where it landed or what fell out of the bags. I was so fucking angry at her stupidity.\n\nShe didn't say boo. She just meekly gathered up her stuff. I think she was shocked by how close she had come to causing a major accident.\n\nThis happened years ago. I am now physically disabled, and I avoid escalators unless I have no alternative. I cannot move fast enough any more to dodge blockages at the bottom of the escalator. If this incident had happened today, I'd have been badly injured, and so probably would have been many of the people behind me.\n\nThat is an example of how quickly, how easily, something can go terribly wrong on an escalator. It only takes a few seconds.", "Your not over thinking it. \n\nMy best friend went up with her 3month old baby. \nSomeone pushed passed her and she accidentally let go of the pram her daughter was in PICU for two weeks.\nUnfortunately she doesn't have a live daughter anymore.\n\nShe has not forgiven herself because she always says if I just waited for the lift my child would still be here.\n\nNTA", "YTA and you need to trust your partner can decide what is and isn\u2019t safe for the newborn without your input.", "NAH.\n\nTo be clear, you were unreasonable but not TA.\n\nThe baby is only a month old, and it's natural for new parents to be nervous, but lighten up.

I\u2019m recently married and pregnant. My husband and I have had this talk and have agreed that it would be each of our responsibilities to set the boundaries with our own parents. It would be much easier for my husband to lay down the rules without it hurting his parents\u2019 pride than if I had to say something and vice versa with my folks. I guess it depends on different cultures as well? I\u2019m Indian so the elders don\u2019t take too kindly to their judgement being questioned by everyone, but if it comes from their kids, they\u2019re more open to it.", "There's much worse things, though a parent who's possibly paranoid, but without a voice is a way to install anxiety into your kid's personality when they start paying attention to you.\n\nNta for caring. \nYta (barely) for not speaking up.", "YTA - Escalators are used all the time with Prams good grief!", "Soft YTA. I appreciate your concern for your newborn and find that very sweet, I also appreciate that you spoke with your wife privately and didn't cause a scene in front of her parents. Your intentions seem good. However, there are many things that are statistically much more dangerous than riding on the escalator. What else are you expecting her to discuss with you in advance? Because crossing the street and riding in a car are also pretty dangerous by comparison. I highly doubt your wife would take any unhealthy risks with your baby, so it probably hurts her to know that you think she would. It might be time to sit down and have a in depth discussion about what you both feel is appropriate and reach some compromises before this becomes a sticking point. For example, a baby in a car is a healthy risk, not using a seat belt would be an unhealthy risk. Iron it out now before this becomes a problem and have some trust in your wife that she's doing her best for your baby.", "I think the thing you are missing is your wife can't know what the anxious knot in your stomach feels like. For her, it's not a safety thing.", "Well they dont everywhere.", "Never in my life have I seen a sign that says that", "Stroller could also break or get caught.", "I see prams on escalators on the tube fairly regularly.", "YTA. It's a monumentally stupid fuckin' boundary (the escalator crap not a general desire to be consulted on situations that *genuinely* pose harm to your child) but at the end of the day you're one of the kid's parents so you have half the final say. Just try not to be condescending or make the situation sound a hell of a lot worse than it actually is when discussing it with your Wife, and bother to actually say something yourself instead of hoping she reads your mind & expresses your thoughts to her parents on your behalf.", "Where do you live OP if your country is bad enough for escalator is legit safety risk if you have stroller the it can be N T A.", "That would make me so uncomfortable, babies are so fragile anyways why wouldn't you just use an elevator it seems like a win win. That just sounds like mild recklessness for something that requires none", "NTA all the people who say they\u2019ve done it without incident have never seen a baby go flying down an escalator in a pram. They\u2019re not allowed on there for a reason. Babies safety takes priority over impatience 110% of the time.", "When it\u2019s your child\u2019s safety at risk, you need to speak up. That was extremely dangerous. It\u2019s possible your wife is desensitized to this risk since she has seen her parents do it with her sisters when her parents were the ultimate protector of them. You didn\u2019t even need to be rude, you could have just said \u201cI\u2019ll wait for the elevator with the baby, why don\u2019t you all go ahead?\u201d \n\nESH. Soft YTA to you but your wife is YTA for arguing against when you thought it was dangerous.", "ok, but can't you stroll your own kid if you're that concerned, or is that a boundary too?", "Given how your wife is rather lax with her parents doing this, it\u2019s best to sit her down and explain the dangers of doing this. There may not be clear signs on every escalator but given there are already dangers simply standing on them, having a big stroller who\u2019s wheels can get caught is even worse. \n\nESH because just because it was done in one generation and everyone turned out \u2018fine\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean the dangers aren\u2019t there. They\u2019re the exception not rule. \n\nI\u2019d start making a list of things that may not seem \u2018dangerous\u2019 and make sure you\u2019re both on the same page because no doubt she\u2019ll say the same of her parents doing it. And you need to start advocating for your kids!!! \n\nIf you end up being seen as the \u2018outlier\u2019 who cares, if god forbid it ever gets worse or something does happen, at least there\u2019s one person who tried to prevent it.", "YTA. You're a grown fecking man. Use your words next time. Expecting your wife to read your mind and consult you for everything is ridiculous.", "Uh parenting isn\u2019t just magically implanted into your brain. She defended herself saying her parents did it all the time therefore it\u2019s not dangerous. \n\nYes he should\u2019ve spoken up but he\u2019s not insulting her as a mother. Rather pointing out that there are certain things that they should discuss about before going through with them. Because ya know, they\u2019re both parents and yes it\u2019s important to know if both are comfortable with random strangers holding your child. \n\nIt\u2019s not \u2018insulting\u2019. Rather communicating that \u2018hey this is known to have dangerous implications, can we please do xyz and try to avoid doing xyz?\u2019 And if him pointing out how her doing one thing is endangering their kids safety and life, is seen as \u2018insulting\u2019 I\u2019d be questioning why she\u2019s more focused on her ego rather than why her partner thinks it\u2019s dangerous and seeking out a compromise or seeing their POV.", "I noticed the end of his post was a long string of questions that amounted to \"in what way is everyone else wrong?\" and not one question asking \"am I being unreasonable?\"\n\nI'm not saying his concerns aren't valid, but his utter lack of concern about his side of it speaks volumes."]}
