So we went up the escalator with my wife\u2019s dad holding the stroller on the escalator. Everything was fine everyone was safe. \n\nNow we had a convo about the situation after and I said that when it comes to a situation where our baby\u2019s safety is at risk she needs to make sure that both of us are on board with it. She argued that she used to see her parents do that escalator trick all the time with her younger sisters and it was okay. I told her it does not matter what her parents did with their kids this is our kid. She argued that she did not see this as a situation where she needed to consult me. \n\nNow I did agree that next time I should speak up but should she have consulted me if it was okay for her family to just take our baby up on the escalator without both of us being okay with it?\n\nThe compromise I\u2019m asking for is that when it comes to our baby\u2019s safety both of us need to be on board. \n\nWho is the A hole? Should my wife have consulted me? Should my wife have more alarms going off in her head when it comes to little situations such as these? Should I have just spoken up or should my wife not even put me in an uncomfortable situation with her side of the family in the first place?

You were right there and have your own voice.", "Yta because you expected your wife to read your mind. You were \"uncomfortable\" but you didn't object.  I actually agree with you about strollers and escalators being a no because it IS a safety issue.its not technically illegal but it's not recommended. You could have been polite but firm. No sorry I am not comfortable with that and scooped the baby out of the pram or commandeered the stroller. When it comes to anything you believe to be a safety issue you speak up immediately. Everytime.  don't concern yourself about  if the inlaws think you are paranoid or overly cautious. They raised their kids in a different time and era where safety standards were lax or nonexistant. And as you stated this is YOUR child. Also... Google escalators and prams.", "YTA. You were there; that was the time to speak up. This 'consultation' stuff is nonsense; if you think there is a risk, you speak up at the time. Don't wait around for your wife to 'consult' with you.\n\nRisk is subjective; you are not always going to be on the same page. It doesn't mean your wife should have 'more alarms going off in her head' nor does it mean you're paranoid.", "YTA for not saying anything and going along with it if your issue is this big", "Yeah it's not about your concern for the baby's safety (which is valid).\n\nIt's about you telling your wife she has to consult you FIRST. Nope.\n\nYou basically told her she can't make parenting decisions without you. And on a macro level, you insulted her as a mother.\n\nWhere is the line? Should she consult you before sending the kid down a slide? On the monkey bars? Should she shoot you a text before getting a balloon (aka a floating choke-trap) from the grocery store? What about when a sweet old lady at church wants to hold the baby but *your wife doesn't know this lady's vaccination records??* \n\nMy point is that hazards are everywhere, your wife is an adult *and a mother* and you need to trust her to navigate the world and its many dangers without intentionally putting the baby at risk. \n\nIn a situation where you perceive a risk that she does not, discuss it respectfully. (Unless the baby is, like, hurtling top speed in a runaway buggy towards traffic.)\n\nPutting your foot down on safety issues is one thing, but you could have done it in a way that didn't insult your postpartum wife. \n\nYTA for how you addressed it.", "Ok I understand your concern.  So state it as a concern, you don't want that to happen again and let that be it.  Be done with it.  Your reaction is way over the top.  Not everything is  so egregious that it required hours long discussion and arguing.

I don't think you're unreasonable to be worried about the safety risk. And I don't think she was unreasonable for not seeing it. I do think it's a little unreasonable to be mad that she didn't check with you first, simply because she didn't think it was dangerous. If she had considered it to be dangerous, and not consulted you, then you'd have a point. But you were standing right there, while they made the decision, and didn't interject in any way. She was right that it was on you to comment, as she wasn't seeing the danger.", "NAH.  You wife did not feel uncomfortable about it and you did.   If she saw no threat then she would not have thought to talk to you about it.   You should have just spoke up and simply said I will carry the baby or take the elevator.   In time you guys will work these things out but not if you both do not communicate the next time something happens", "NAH. The two of you had differing thoughts on the safety of the escalator, no problem there. Your wife isn't a telepath, and you didn't say anything, so the situation continued on as it was. You aren't asking for anything unreasonable going forward, your wife wasn't unreasonable to expect you to speak up if you had a concern. However, you may need to be prepared to speak up more than you would think, because for her to think to ask you if you think a situation is safe she is going to need to consider it unsafe herself.", "NTA but just pick the baby up out of the stroller and carry the baby up the escalator", "Honestly? I have to give this one a NAH. It sounds like the danger genuinely didn't occur to your wife because taking strollers on escalators has been normalized for her. I don't agree with her, but I have a hard time calling her an AH for simply not realizing something, especially since the person with the safety concern (you) didn't speak up in the moment.\n\nHowever, I'm not going to call you an AH either. Having the baby in the stroller on the escalator IS a safety risk. It may not be the biggest craziest risk you could take, but you're not wrong to be concerned about it. And it sounds as if you raised it in an appropriate conversational way with your wife.\n\nFor me this is not an AH situation, it's a \"let's learn from this and do better in the future\" situation.", "NAH. The worst risk of escalators is getting clothing or hair caught in the mechanism. The next worst is having the stroller in front of you (if it's a down escalator) and then losing your grip, possibly because of an emergency stop. If you always stand between the abyss and the stroller, it should be quite safe. But in doubt, take baby out of the stroller, go on the escalator with an empty stroller and put baby in the stroller once you're at your destination.\n\nJust feeling that your baby is at risk is a good reason to have a second look at the situation. But expecting your wife to see the same risks that you do is a bit too much - she has other experiences and knowledge and might well not consider this a problem worthy of consultation. There's a film titled The Elevator, once you've seen that you might consider the elevator a worse risk :-)", "ESH - you're right, on both counts. First it IS unsafe and you should have waited for the elevator. Whatever is on the next floor up can't be THAT urgent that a few extra seconds will be catastrophic. And she SHOULD have consulted you. It's not her fathers baby, it's your and her baby. You need to be communicating about these things. \n\nWhich brings me to you. You didn't communicate your discomfort and by not doing so implied you were OK with it to everyone. Communication takes two, and you failed to speak up, in defense of your baby.", "NAH. How was he supposed to know you and your wife weren\u2019t both ok with it if you didn\u2019t say anything? How was your wife supposed to know you wanted to be consulted, when she clearly thinks of it as a normal thing to do *and you didn\u2019t say anything *?", "YTA for allowing it to happen and THEN trying to be upset about it.  \n\nI have personally witnessed a baby being dropped out of a stroller on an escalator, it was not a good time for anyone. \n\n Why didn't someone just hold the baby?   You don't get to go along with things and then act like you were overridden.", "Nobody is an asshole, first parent jitters are normal. In the UK there\u2019s signs saying not to take pushchairs on the escalators so I understand your concerns, but I\u2019ve also done it when the lift was broke.", "NAH, you're a new parent and you're terrified.

Security would also keep an eye on it. One day there was an accident. Pram rolled down and to the side, knocking down people in front of it\u2026mum tried to grab it and end up falling and hitting her face (right in her eye with the pram\u2019s handle) and the gran that was with them,who had the other child with her,started having chest pain. Baby needed sutures on her forehead. The other child had no one from her family to comfort her and reassure her. Mum had lots of blood in her eye socket. Gran had to be taken to the hospital because she was having a heart attack.\nOP you\u2019re NTA.

From your wife\u2019s perspective this situation was not a huge deal (as a Mom of 4... I agree). From your perspective you believed it\u2019s a safety risk. Is it worth an argument? No. Will there need to be a discussion every time someone has concerns? No. Either you\u2019re going to trust each other or your not. If it\u2019s that important to you then speak up. Having a difference of opinion does not mean either of you are assholes.\n\nDo you honestly believe any of your family would put your child at risk?

However, if you\u2019re concerned about their actions then tell them.\n\neta \u2014 instead of worrying about who is right or wrong in every situation ... just solve the problem.

Fold it and transport it while someone holds the baby.", "While I understand the desire to keep the baby safe at all times, you need to calm down.

Of course your wife should discuss safety matters with you but it\u2019s an escalator? It\u2019s really not so serious.", "NAH not everyone sees risks in the same activities, and reasonable people can disagree about the perfect degree of caution. It's especially tough to disagree about something as important as keeping a baby safe. It sounds like you guys are surrounded by love and support and are open and loving with each other, an excellent head start! The rest takes patience and practice", "NTA. As parents, it's crucial to prioritize our baby's safety. Communication is key, and both of you should be on the same page when it comes to risky situations. Remember,  it's not about who did what with younger siblings, but about what makes you both comfortable as parents. Ironing out these parenting details can be a challenge, but it's great that you're open to learning and finding common ground.", "Soft YTA. You are very much over reacting. Everyone takes the escalator with a stroller. It\u2019s not unsafe at all, and you shaming your wife for \u00ab\u00a0putting you baby in danger\u00a0\u00bb was out of line. You need to learn to relax if you don\u2019t want to become a helicopter parent.", "NTA Baby\u2019s safety should always take priority over convenience. Escalators weren\u2019t designed to accommodate prams, which means using them with a pram puts your baby at risk of an injury.", "NTA. Escalators have rules for a reason.\n\nNot pram-related, but this story will give you an idea of the brainless things people do on and around escalators.\n\nI was standing on an escalator heading downwards. I always make sure there's at least one empty step between me and the person in front. If possible, I leave a few steps empty. But even so, it was a busy railway station, and the escalator was fairly crowded and moving fast. The woman a couple of steps in front of me was carrying several shopping bags.\n\nI had almost reached the lower level, the woman in front of me stepped off - and dropped one of her shopping bags. She stopped dead in her tracks, tried to pick it up - and promptly dropped two more bags. She went to pick those one up too. **She and her bags were now entirely blocking the exit of this fast-moving escalator.**\n\nIn my loudest, angriest voice, I yelled \"GET OUT OF THE WAY!\"\n\nShe yelped, shot a glance over her shoulder at the column of people headed by me who were about to land right on top of her, and scuttled out of the way. I stepped off the escalator, dodged around one of her bags, kicked it to buggery, stepped aside, and as quickly as I could, I picked up her shopping and shit and flung it aside so that the people coming off the escalator wouldn't trip over it or get tangled up in it. I didn't give a shit where it landed or what fell out of the bags. I was so fucking angry at her stupidity.\n\nShe didn't say boo. She just meekly gathered up her stuff. I think she was shocked by how close she had come to causing a major accident.\n\nThis happened years ago. I am now physically disabled, and I avoid escalators unless I have no alternative. I cannot move fast enough any more to dodge blockages at the bottom of the escalator. If this incident had happened today, I'd have been badly injured, and so probably would have been many of the people behind me.\n\nThat is an example of how quickly, how easily, something can go terribly wrong on an escalator. It only takes a few seconds.", "Your not over thinking it. \n\nMy best friend went up with her 3month old baby. \nSomeone pushed passed her and she accidentally let go of the pram her daughter was in PICU for two weeks.\nUnfortunately she doesn't have a live daughter anymore.\n\nShe has not forgiven herself because she always says if I just waited for the lift my child would still be here.\n\nNTA", "YTA and you need to trust your partner can decide what is and isn\u2019t safe for the newborn without your input.", "NAH.\n\nTo be clear, you were unreasonable but not TA.\n\nThe baby is only a month old, and it's natural for new parents to be nervous, but lighten up.

Like the Nature Boy Ric Flair says, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, do something about it! Woooooo!\u201d\n\nYTA", "NAH \n\nYou\u2019re a new parent and you\u2019re going to worry. Your feelings are valid. So are your wife\u2019s feelings. This isn\u2019t anyone putting the car seat in the hood to make space for another passenger. I personally don\u2019t see the danger. If it upset you that much, maybe pick up your baby and hold them while going up.", "Soft YTA, and good learning experience. Your wife has different lived experiences, and this is not something dangerous to her. It is to you. You need to voice your discomfort, and it may be up to you to step up and do the extra work (taking baby to the elevator, then catching up to everyone). \n\nThere will probably be other things like this where you are comfortable and your wife is not and vice versa. I see the key here being communication and respect. Make sure you are backing up your wife and she is backing up you. As a first step, you need to communicate rather than just letting it percolate internally at the moment.", "You're a parent now.  Time to grow that pair of balls you used to make the kid.\n\nThere will be countless times something is perceived as risky to one but harmless to another.  What the parent says, goes.  Who else will advocate for your baby other than you.\n\nUse this as a good learning lesson that you don't \"ask\", you \"tell\" from here on out.", "No you always take the lift if there is one. Always. Escalator unnecessarily increases risk. I got stuck with the buggy on one once, scared the shit out of me. NTA", "Escalators are no more inherently dangerous than anything else. But your logic, you shouldn\u2019t take a stroller on an elevator, either because the elevators cable can snap and drop your baby.", "Nta your righht because I worked near an escalator and the amount of accidents on that thing involving strollers and seniors its insane", "NTA- that freaking dangerous and the sign even says so. This is a hill to die on.", "YTA for expecting your spouse to read your mind.", "Awwww I remember my first baby", "YTA. Everyone else has explained why.", "YTA. Many people have stated why, which I agree with. But I also want to add the fact that your reaction is very helicoptery. Is an elevator any safer than an escalator? What if the cable snaps? What if it gets stuck for hours? Life is dangerous. You can't shield your child from every bad thing forever, and if you try, you'll only set them up for failure when they'll inevitably be terrified of doing anything. Lighten up man.", "Not a big deal every body whom has kids done this and all survived. You have new dad jitter which is normal.  You will get over it.", "YTA if you felt this was unsafe you could have held your baby whilst the stroller was carried up the escalator. Anybody carrying a baby in a stroller is being super cautious though. The risk was close to none.", "YTA. Do u seriously think u can make every single little decision together? It\u2019s just not possible. First time parents, I get it. But there will be times for both of u to make your own decisions.", "You\u2019re all the A. The parents for putting your child at risk , your wife for allowing it and you for not speaking up there and then.  There\u2019s a reason stroller\u2019s, carts , wheelchairs are not allowed on electric escalators.\nM", "YTA, only because what they did wasn't a safety risk in any reasonable way. You definitely should have equal say, and one veto should be enough to stop activities that may actually be dangerous - like pediatricians don't recommend allowing kids under five on trampolines because the risk of joint injury is so much higher, so one parent can say \"no, because there's a real risk\". \n\nThis sounds more like you have some new-parent anxiety and not very much experience with or around children. YTA for this, but not for reasonable things.", "YTA for not speaking for yourself.\n\nIt would be so weird if it\u2019s like - let\u2019s do this relatively normal thing (for them at least) and your wife has to say \u2026 \u201clet me consult with hubby, are you okay?\u201d And you say I\u2019ll allow it. Like wtf. \n\nIf you disagree (and I\u2019d have probably have just waited for the elevator too!) than say it.  \u201cYou guys go ahead, I\u2019ll wait for the elevator with the stroller\u201d", "I would never let anyone take my child in a stroller on an escalator. I HAD to one time because the elevator was down. I pushed it on the escalator and held the handle up to keep it level and pushed into the stair ahead to keep it stable and braced it with weight. Then some large man in a hurry tried to shove past me. The stroller being on wheels slid sideways and started to fall sideways as I was. I grabbed my baby as I laid down and let the stroller fall. Someone below brought it up to me while I lay shaking on the floor at the top.\n\nWhen my brother was small (under 5) he fell getting off the escalator. His palm landed where the steps went into the floor. This is shaped like teeth. It grabbed the skin on his hand and ripped it off and then continued on his wrist. I was 10. I considered escalators dangerous ever since.\n\nEscalators are great when life is perfect. But the world is full of A H so roll the dice with your own child. I\u2019ll bring your stroller up to you when some idiot endangers you.\n\nNTA", "I think you may have some issues with paranoia now that you are a new parent. You should be curious about that and try to work through it. So YTA", "Stroller accident https://youtu.be/UzVU7TvbH6I", "Nah. Just pick the baby up out the stroller and ride the escalator.  Then put the baby back in the stroller.", "Meanwhile there is a sign on the escalator saying not to do exactly that. Speak up next time. Say you'll wait for the elevator with baby and the others can hold ahead.\n\nNta.", "NAH. Just be ready to act next time rather than be offended later. You'll get the hang of it as a parent.", "YTA, you were there, if you had an issue with it you should\u2019ve spoken up. Your wife most likely assumed you were fine with it because if you weren\u2019t you would have said something. It\u2019s not up to her to check in with you on every little thing if you\u2019re literally part of the group and the discussion, that\u2019s when you speak up and say you\u2019re not comfortable and say you\u2019ll wait with your son for the elevator and meet the others upstairs", "ESH\n\nWhile I agree that the escalator isn't all that safe and shouldn't be taken on it unless there's no other option,  your wife isn't a mind reader and you didn't speak up that you thought it was dangerous(especially since it's the norm in her family apparently) and just went ahead and let them do it then it's just as much on you as it is on anyone else.", "Yeah the problem is that if they think it's fine then they're not gonna think \"oh it's a safety thing let's ask OP\". If they thought it was a safety issue then they just wouldn't have done it, no one puts babies on danger on purpose. It's on OP to get on the same page in the moment or going forward.", "Yea Op needs to grow a set lol", "That last bit is a very good point. My little one was born 7 days before Xmas. The only people she saw until after her 6 week vaccinations were immediate family and that's because I knew their vaccination statuses and knew they were being cautious with covid exposures because she had no immune system yet. We didn't hit a mall until she was about 10weeks old.", " Clearly has never seen the dozens and dozens of videos and news articles of strollers/shopping carts falling down escalators due to losing balance/baby shifting etc", "It **is** unsafe. That's why it's forbidden in most places.", "The wheels get caught in the track and can also break them. \n\nThis is like saying it\u2019s not bad to face the car seat forward or it\u2019s okay to put your baby in your lap while driving. Or letting a child sit in the front passenger seat. \n\nThe risk of death drops astronomically, so why even take the risk?", "Bot\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1514v2q/comment/js6o8ku/", "Yea OP just throws off weak vibes", "I\u2019ve never seen one of those signs in my life. Don\u2019t assume your norm is everyone elses", "Here in The Netherlands, It's normal and no signs are there.", ">Tbh that's just as dangerous if not more. If OP then trips/gets snagged results could be fatal, for either or both\n\nBy that logic, it's also dangerous to walk anywhere while holding your baby in case you trip and fall.", "Agree. I worked retail in a mall for 6 years and definitely saw some nasty accidents involving blood and needing paramedics on escalators.", "Is it (genuine question here because I've never noticed this ever)? I've been to all the provinces and territories here (including major cities, small towns, etc.), but I have never seen it as taboo for any parents - never seen any signs against it. I get the safety reasonings, but I've just never seen anything prompting against it.", "I'm guessing you aren't American. My boyfriend is from Ireland, and he marvels at the warnings and stuff that we have on everything in America. Escalators here can have warnings about its dangers for small children, having loose shoelaces, breaking your fingers on the handrail (somehow, not sure but I can clearly visualize the sign), going the wrong way, etc. Based on some of the signage, you'd think riding an escalator was an extreme sport.\n\nNot disagreeing that it's neither super dangerous nor perfectly safe. It's just interesting how people's experiences can differ on such a silly little thing.", "The thing is, there can't be signs for absolutely every danger, but you have to realize that if it is unsafe where I live, it is also unsafe where you live. \n\nLast week we watched idiots climbing over rocks at the top of a  tall waterfall. Not a sign in that particular spot, but we watched one guy slip and almost plunge to his death. He was probably too stupid to be shaken by the experience, but the 25 or so people watching from the other side were all traumatized.", "Falling on the floor is not equal to falling on escalators. Believe me. I've never been covered with as much blood from a head wound than when an escalator has been involved.", "They don\u2019t allow it here in England. Big signs saying no strollers or wheelchairs on the escalators.", "That sounds horrible!! Was the baby alright?", "Lol explain to your BF that we have lawsuits in America \ud83e\udd23", "True. But I've seen news stories where children have died or lost their feet and legs because they get their feet stuck in an escalator. And it's not always from untied shoes. Sometimes it's from not paying attention.", "But there's still a risk, and lots of ppl have multiple level homes that require walking up and down stairs. Not to mention, depending on the fall, even dropping a baby from a regular height could still be disastrous. You're talking about a totally unpredictable accident, something that could happen in any situation. There is nothing perfectly safe. You could put your kid in a car seat, but a bad enough accident could still kill them. So what are tou going to do, avoid everything and keep your baby in a crib?", "Are hills mechanical moving objects that can suddenly grind to a halt jerking people on it forwards? What magical hill you have in your area.\n\nThere are certain things you can do to lower the risk to hurting a child, not taking them on an escalator in a buggy is one of those things.\n\nYou can never totally eliminate risk out in the big bad world, but why add extra risk?", "Really? I\u2019m from wales and go to England constantly almost every month and never seen that. I\u2019m a mother to 4 and never done it personally but I\u2019ve seen others do it and there\u2019s no signs saying that where I\u2019ve visited", "Yes! Thankfully. Some other guy got there around when I did and between the three of us we were able to stop the escalator and lift the whole buggy over the side to the ground.", "You could trip while going down the hill and drop the stroller. It\u2019s pretty much a possibility.\n\nIf you really strive to eliminate unnecessary risks\u2026 then don\u2019t go to the mall. Car accidents kill way more babies than escalators.", "That sounds honestly terrifying. I'm not sure why people think the escalator is an option when you have a baby carrier but I also don't use it when I have tennis shoes due to the shoelaces so maybe it's just a me thing.", "You just back the damn thing in reverse into the step of the escalator and keep a good grip on the stroller handle. One acts as weight against a fulcrum, it's not rocket science, just the teachings of Achimedes which have been written since at least the third century BC.\n\nIf you have kids, do you bubble wrap them on the way out the door?", "They do yes. I assume you also but toddlers in cars without car seats? Or is that somehow different? Some safety rules are ignorable but others aren't?\n\nHey if you have a kid and want to put it in unnecessary risk, go ahead. Your kid, risk it all you want.", "People put kids at risks everyday. Going places in cars. Giving them food when they could choke on it or get allergic reactions. Bringing them to the park where they could get injured. Having them fall in the stairs.\n\nThere are a lot of things way worst than a stroller on an elevator that are as useless risks as that. Why are escalators the worst?! The chances of injuries depend on so many bad lucks happening all at the same time. If you are scared of that, you\u2019ll never stop being scared and your kids will grow up fearing to go outside. That\u2019s sad. Life is too short to wrap your kids in bubble wrap", "The world is full of dangers that is true. If you lose control of a buggy on an elevator, it rolls and hits the wall within a ft. If you lose it on an escalator, you're gonna take out anyone in front of you if going down.\n\nIt's not wrapping them up in bubble wrap to avoid obvious risks. But fuck it, teach them to talk to strangers, play in the road, ignore warning signs. YOLO."]}
