I'm also a great-grandma. Your grandmother is out of line. First, you can buy insurance that will cover most of the cost of rental cars and, if she opted not to have it, that was her choice instead of yours. Second, she was just in an accident. If your car gets damaged while she's driving it does her insurance cover it? Your insurance company shouldn't have to and will your rates increase if she's in another accident? Third: She's acting like you owe her. My grandkids owe me respect when I respect them. They owe me the right to make the rules in my home and I owe them the right to make the rules in their home. That goes for cars, too. Grandma is out of line asking you to let great grandma use your car. Adding an \"I won't help you if you need it\" caveat is also inappropriate beyond comprehension. Why doesn't she let great grandma borrow her car? Or maybe she can help by sharing the cost of the rental car.\n\nNTA ---- You're not the ah because Great Grandma Carma (me) said so, dear.
