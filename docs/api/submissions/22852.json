Since the surgery I have partial paralysis from the waist down on the left side, I can still walk thankfully, but my muscles are very week and I have absolutely no feeling in that leg (I have a limp and use a cane). I have been posting about it on Facebook as it helps me from getting too depressed about the whole thing. \n\nNow to the friend (30f) in question. We've known each other since elementary school but haven't really talked since high school but obviously still have each other on Facebook. Recently I got a message from her of a picture of me at the grocery store walking around, with a nasty message telling me I was lying for attention and that I'm making fun of actually paralyzed people. I explained the above, and how partial and local paralysis works, but she insisted that they didn't exist and I never actually had surgery. This went on for a couple days until I finally just sent her a photo of my incision while I was still in the hospital and a photo of the disc they removed (neither of them were bloody or overly grotesque).\n\nI didn't hear back from her for a day, so I just kind of forgot about it until I started getting messages from mutual friends telling me that it was disgusting of me and that she is now traumatized from seeing my photos. She's blocked me at this point, and a some friends have said that she rude but I didn't have to send pictures and ITA for doing so, close family and friends have said I'm in the right. I would just really love some outside opinions on this one.

I hope you're recovering well from your surgery. You are so NTA, and this situation is hilarious. A classic case of FAFO. Your ex friend is a jerk.", "NTA, it\u2019s crazy how she was so invested in your condition and calls you attention seeking. She could\u2019ve just hidden your posts? \n\nThen when you do confirm it, she then started saying she was traumatised, from a photo, and telling all your mutual friends to message you, which certainly isn\u2019t attention seeking.\n\nI would reassess if these are friends, considering, they messaged you saying you upset 30f friend, rather than saying, how are you doing after your surgery.\n\nFor a bunch of 30 year olds this sure sounds immature. \n\nBe glad they blocked you, be sure to block them back, so when they can\u2019t resist being nosey again, you won\u2019t be visible.", "NTA: I am sorry this is a fuck around and find-out situation.  She should feel traumatized from being such an asshole to a woman who has been through a lot. Instead of saying you are lying, she should be asking you how to support you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't you dare feel bad for proving that you aren't a liar.", "This is not your friend. She accused you of being a blatant liar, etc. The puzzle is why you continued to interact with her. You owed her no proof. Blocking the AH everywhere would have been justified.\n\nAs for your question: NTA because she well-deserved it.", "NTA. I have an invisible disability and use a cane, I would've done the same thing if someone tried that on me. Oh you think I'm not allowed to use walking aids because you think I'm faking or too young to be sick? Well lemme show you the x-rays...", "NTA \n\nDoubting Debbie needed proof so you gave her proof. She's just upset for being wrong so she's pointing fingers at you instead of at herself. Block her as well as those who are on her side.

This is a classing example of: f*ck around and find out. \n\nSuggesting that you were faking your disability is abhorrent. You did the perfect thing. It was a single action, as opposed to a long back and forth trying to convince this person, and it had the maximum effect.", "NTA! She's calling you a liar and being an ableist. Eff her, and the friends sticking up for her. She wouldn't drop it and continued calling you out, you showed her proof. Period.", "NTA. As soon as she dropped the accusation that you were lying about surgery that opened the door to you defending yourself by providing proof if you wanted to do so.\n\nYou could have screenshotted her harassing messages and sent them to friends as an alternative, but I don't see anything wrong with what you did either.", "NTA \n\n30 years old and she is going around accusing people of lying about injuries or surgeries etc about shit she doesn\u2019t know? Wow what a class act. \n\nI am hoping that any mutual friends you guys have that are telling you that you were in the wrong didn\u2019t know the whole story and thought you sent the photos unsolicited and hopefully when they find out what actually happened they support you. If they still support her after that they are not friends, and you should drop them like hot potatoes.", "NTA.\n\nCan't really think of anything else to say other then I really enjoyed your friends idiocy.", "You dodged a bullet by making this self-centered, dramatic ass person your ex-friend. NTA.", "NTA. Your \"Friend\" (Not really a friend, is she?) Is just trying to stir up drama for attention and it's working.

I have hemipaligia over my entire left side from the brain surgery that saved my life. While I walk with a limp some days, it's so hard.

Calling out people for not having disabilities because you're ignorant and assume that if you have some kind of back or leg issue you'll only ever be in a chair and that your disability has to be super obvious is not a bad thing.\n\nThey blocked you not because they are traumatised, they blocked you and came up with that to not have to apologise and be wrong.\n\nMy joints are bad enough that I can use a wheelchair but I need to constantly move my knees or they ache and hurt even worse so I really need to both move them in the chair and sometimes get around to walk. SO SO many times assholes are like \"your legs are moving you're faking\", yeah I never said I can't use my legs, your expectation that someone in a wheelchair can't use their legs is your stupidity not my problem. \n\nBut it's SO bad and so frequent I barely use my chair as it's not worth the hassle.", "NTA.\n\nShe was being a jerk, and she got served on a stainless steel medical grade platter.

It\u2019s more likely that she wasn\u2019t traumatized, but is embarrassed by her behavior and is seeking out a narrative where you\u2019re still evil and she\u2019s somehow a victim. It\u2019s just to get people on her side before they hear it from you and realize she\u2019s trash. \n\nWhen I was in my late teens I had to be on chemo for my autoimmune disease.

I reckon she blocked you because you proved her wrong. NTA. She accused you of something, you provided evidence to the contrary. Wishing you a speedy recovery", "NTA, based off what you said. She probably didn't understand your social media posts, and thought you were saying that you were immobile. That doesn't mean she should be sending you nasty messages and gossiping about it, a normal person would've just asked you for more information. Sending her the surgical photo is a completely understandable response to someone saying you made it up, and that you never had surgery.
