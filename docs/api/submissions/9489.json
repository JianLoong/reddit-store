Of course, the mom asks me to switch with her kid because he likes the window. \n\nI simply say no, don't really make an excuse or anything. The mom looked shocked I said no, and insisted. I don't really like talking to strangers and I wasn't looking for a fight so I said no again and put on my headphones so she drops it, but I don't really turn them on. She starts bad mouthing me and got the flight attendants attention, the attendant told her that it was my choice, asked her if it was going to be a problem, I guess that was threatening enough to make her shut up. \n\nIt was an awkward flight.

AITA? \n\nTLDR I refused to give this kid the window seat and his mom got mad at me, aita?\n\nEdit: I showed my friend the post and she said that what she meant is that the kid probably doesn't get to travel much and was let down, but she loves kids so I can see why she would just think of him.

And if you must ask, the seat you are offering up should always be better than the seat of the person you are currently requesting this favor from.
