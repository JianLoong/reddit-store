I bought myself a window seat on the plane because I like the window, not really any other reason. \n\nSo we board the plane and I sit on my designated seat.

Of course, the mom asks me to switch with her kid because he likes the window. \n\nI simply say no, don't really make an excuse or anything. The mom looked shocked I said no, and insisted. I don't really like talking to strangers and I wasn't looking for a fight so I said no again and put on my headphones so she drops it, but I don't really turn them on. She starts bad mouthing me and got the flight attendants attention, the attendant told her that it was my choice, asked her if it was going to be a problem, I guess that was threatening enough to make her shut up. \n\nIt was an awkward flight. And when we got there she deliberately took a long time to get up and probably insulted me, though I couldn't hear her cause this time I was listening to music. \n\nI told my friend this story and she said I should've just moved, but idk I mean I reserved that seat. AITA? \n\nTLDR I refused to give this kid the window seat and his mom got mad at me, aita?", "created_utc": 1675887151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x9dwz/aita_for_not_switching_seats/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you know your kid's going to want a window seat, buy a window seat. Slightly different if it's a situation where there were no reserved seats and they're asking someone to move so minors can sit with their parent or something but not just so they can look out the window. \n\nWell done for not getting in to a big debate with them about why you won't move.

My kids had to deal with variety of seating arrangements ... but we always made sure to book what we wanted. That is the thing - if he likes windows, why did she put him in the middle?", "NTA", "NTA and I am just flummoxed by all these posts about people who are approached and asked to switch seats- and the seat is pretty much always a downgrade. Personally I am of the school that even asking is kind of rude because it puts someone on the spot. Plenty of people will agree to do it out of fear of confrontation not because they are fine giving up their superior seat. And if you must ask, the seat you are offering up should always be better than the seat of the person you are currently requesting this favor from. I am so annoyed by all these posts where moms are asking a stranger to switch so they can sit with their minor kids yet they expect to keep their good seat and switch the bad seat out with the stranger .\n\nAlso, OP, your friend probably just thought she was being pragmatic by saying that it\u2019s better just to give up the seat than deal this someone sitting next to you making the rest of the flight unpleasant. Of course it\u2019s this kind of philosophy that lets entitled people get what they want. They know exactly what they are doing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
