Good to have your spidey senses on alert.", "NTA You agreed to care for one person in their home with no one else living there, and definitely not with a person that creeps you out. On top of this it is going to increase your workload. If your boss/his mother insists that he can sleep there you need to start finding other options for work. You safety is your priority and if this family cant respect that you should not keep working with them.", "NTA. You didn't tell her you want that guy to be removed from the house, simply said you feel uncomfortable. For me it's perfectly fine. If something is bothering you it's better to say that asap, so you can avoid uncomfortable situations", "Info: are you employed through an agency or anything like that?

How many/what ADLs does she require help with? Can she toilet independently? Does she require medication?\n\nI'm also a dementia caregiver and I can't think of a scenario where I would feel comfortable enough to leave a client alone overnight, unless she has a competent family member or respite care with her. If she is moderately independent, I don't see why the grandson can't assist her. Although, seeing as he has a history of striking women, I would not leave him unaccompanied with your client. Elders, and especially elders with cognitive disabilities are at substantially increased risk of abuse- physical, emotional, and financial. Your employer needs to apply for respite services until you feel safe enough to return.", "YTA.

If your employer refuses to make arrangements, I think your best option would be to consult adult protective services and make them aware of the situation and ask how to proceed without leaving your client without care, because that could be seen by the state as abandonment, but maybe not- my knowledge is based on my own state laws which are incredibly rigid in regards to elder care.
