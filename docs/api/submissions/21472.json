{"id": 21472, "submission_id": "14s5r38", "title": "AITA for wearing a charcoal face mask outside my room?", "selftext": "Hey everyone. I (19F) am currently in college and am taking a summer term of courses, that are expected to go until the end of this month. My roommate from this past school year moved out at the end of spring quarter a few weeks ago and I am currently living in my dorm alone. My neighbor \"Anne\" is in the room right next to me. We aren't super close but we talk occasionally. \n\nYesterday I did some shopping off campus and I saw that Target was selling some face masks. I felt like my skin could use some care, so I bought a charcoal face mask that was supposed to \"detoxify and purify my skin.\" That evening, I washed my face and put on the mask. The instructions said to leave the mask on for about 30 minutes until it was dry so I decided to get some other things done while I waited. \n\nI stepped outside my dorm room, while I still had the mask on and went downstairs to the vending machine to get a soda. When I got down there, Anne was also there. I said hi and when Anne saw me, she looked horrified. Anne asked me what was on my face. I said it was a face mask. She asked me why I thought that it was okay for me to step outside wearing that. I asked her if there was a problem with my face mask. She said yes, and that it looks too much like blackface. I was taken aback because that was not what I intended at all. I told her that I obviously wasn't trying to do blackface, it was just a charcoal face mask for my skin. Anne said that she didn't care because it looked too much like blackface and that next time I should stay in the dorm room with that on. She also told me to consider how other people may feel if they saw me wearing that. Anne left afterwards and went back upstairs to her room. \n\nNow I am second guessing myself. I just wanted to wear a face mask, and wasn't at all trying to promote blackface. But I can see how it can get mistaken for so. Maybe I should have just stayed in my room. I am a white woman and I know that blackface has a long and disgusting history and I don't want to be associated with that at all.

Accusing people of things that aren\u2019t there in order to score brownie points that lend them social currency elsewhere.
