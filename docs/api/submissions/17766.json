I had 2 early miscarriages, 6-9 weeks. Cannot imagine your grief.", "Anytime I read comments about pregnancy loss I feel like we\u2019re all in a big group hug. Love you guys.", "As someone who\u2019s trying to break up with my a hole bf right now because im almost certain he\u2019d act just like your partner if I were pregnant, I just wanna mention that you used word and phrase \u201cmanipulate\u201d and \u201che doesn\u2019t let us\u201d he might not be outright abusing you but he\u2019s using abusive tactics and exhibiting abusive patterns with you. Which is still, you know, not great. A grown man who won\u2019t eat unless his woman cooks for him, won\u2019t let her spend money because he\u2019d rather you suck it up and just silently bear the stress, exhaustion, and discomfort as you literally grow and nurture his unborn child. And won\u2019t consult you like an equal about big decisions that affect your quality of life and well being.. yeah ur NTA \nIf you ever get the chance I recommend \u201cwhy does he do that: inside the minds of angry and controlling men\u201d by Lundy Bancroft. But above all please please please op take care of yourself, be around people who openly love you and want to see your life and your pregnancy be easier and who don\u2019t make you feel small for your thoughts and feelings. Because even if you\u2019re hormonal (you\u2019re not) what harm does it do to take your wife\u2019s feelings and just.. consider them before outright dismissing and overriding them??", "Babe you work. You can order your own food for just you.\n\nAlternatively is there anyone else at all you can stay with? Like, literally, anyone else not this manipulative abuser who seems fine with you losing your kid.", "I get it's a cultural thing for you to be the good wife and caregiver. But the health of your baby, HIS baby is at risk. I'd look him dead in the eye and say if you do not do ACTUAL bed rest, even if the house gets dirty, then HIS baby will die. Get emotional about it. Tell him going to the ER during pregnancy isn't normal. Make it about the baby and not you if you have to. But please, stop what you're doing, and go lay down in bed for the next 3-4 months", "Honey, i think its time for you to think about divorce and prepare to be a single mother", "Do you have family you can stay with? You are supposed to be waited on, not doing the waiting.", "Do you have family nearby?", "This is wild. Defs just cook for you\u2026 fuck this dude", "I suspect that your husband does not even engage enough with the domestic work in the house to know what all of the chores ARE. So when he says that you would not have to do more work, I reckon he is coming from a place of complete ignorance about what the chores are.\n\nYou are NTA and you have a major husband problem. If you're able to, please get in front of this now, this will only get worse once your child is born.", "Can you go stay with your family? Everything you're doing is jeopardizing your and your baby's well being. NTA", "Guess you're using the money from your full time job to buy your own takeaway.", "Just cook them and never clean. My husband one time told me X was dirty and I said \u201cyou clean it your arms aren\u2019t broken\u201d hasn\u2019t been dumb enough to say anything after that.", "Be sure to keep up with your obstetrician so they can catch the inevitable issue early and you can be hospitalized in antepartum ward until it's potentially safe enough to deliver.", "OP, read these links: \n\nhttps://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/\n\nhttps://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/\n\nhttps://www.glamour.com/story/it-took-divorce-to-make-my-marriage-equal\n\nhttps://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/weaponized-incompetence\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288\n\nhttps://english.emmaclit.com/2022/09/01/where-does-it-go/\n\nThen read this book (and watch the film if you\u2019d like): https://www.fairplaylife.com \n\nIf your husband won\u2019t change, then at least you\u2019ll have all this information for future reference if you ever decide to try another relationship.", "Ew. Being alone is better than that.", "So.... let him starve. Let him sit in his own filth until he realizes he's a big boy and needs to step up and BE A GOOD HUSBAND. He's literally putting you and your unborn baby at risk, and still act like his slave. Why???? You do know this isn't ancient times, and women are no longer property right? \n\nHis actions say that he either doesn't respect you, doesn't love you, or a combo of both. He didn't ask you if his brother could move in, because he doesn't value your opinion, or don't deserve a say in household decisions", "Well if you don't watch out they will put you on bed rest in the hospital. My best friend spent 6 weeks on hospital bed rest and still delivered early. Those 6 weeks were torture on her cause she has a hard time being still and is always on the go", "Big hugs back \u2764\ufe0f\nIt's good to feel seen and validated.", "This comment is the answer", "I don't think he cares. He can always find a new wife if the first one dies, right?", "Honey, take this to heart.\n\nI'm often pretty lazy. I hate cleaning, I avoid it when I can. I like to cook, but sometimes I don't feel like it. If I'm unwell or in need of bedrest I will spend the day in bed and ask my husband to help me out. I regularly order in food when I can't be bothered to cook.\n\nMy husband still makes me feel like I'm the best wife in the whole world.\n\nYou are not a bad wife. I am so sorry you're married to a bad husband.", "You\u2019re concerned with being labeled a bad wife but step back and look at the picture that is your life!! He is a BAD husband!! You have a high risk pregnancy and you are supposed to be on bed rest and rather than stepping up and being an amazing partner to you and your future child, he\u2019s MANIPULATING you to do the cooking and the cleaning and he\u2019s trying to add his brother to the mix and by doing so you guys loose your own bedroom in the apartment you two are paying for?!?!? What in the actual fuck does he bring to the relationship?? He is absolutely positively the asshole and I can\u2019t understand why you are even entertaining this relationship. Put your foot down and tell him it\u2019s either you and the baby or his brother but he can\u2019t have all four of you. He either steps up or steps aside and let a real man show you how you should be treated. What happens if you continue being his slave and something happens because you didn\u2019t want to follow the doctors orders and you lose the baby, how would you feel about it?? You need to do some serious soul searching and figure out you are worth way more that what your husband is dishing out!! \n\nWish you all the best op and I hope you have a safe and smooth delivery and you enjoy the new bundle of joy you created!!", "Then be a bad wife. He\u2019s already being a bad husband", "What do you care what he thinks now?  \nHe is treating you VERY poorly.", "You have a bad husband. Horrible actually.", "Would you rather be a bad wife or a bad mum? You need to prioritize the child you're carrying", "If you lose your baby, you will be labelled as a bad mother. Your husband will blame you, most likely his family will blame you too. I don't know if you have a support system in your own family and friends. But you're putting yourself and your baby at a huge risk, and if something unfortunate happens it will be because of your husband, but you will be the one to bear the responsibility.", "Be a \u201cbad\u201d wife.

You are a person who deserves kindness and respect and to be well and healthy!)", "OP, I don't want to be cruel to you, I really don't.\n\nBut doctors don't put you on bed rest for no reason. Doctors have SIGNIFICANTLY cut down how often they place people on bed rest.\n\nWhat happens if you lose your baby? Do you think he's going to support you? What if you die? How will he treat your baby? Both of those are very real possibilities.\n\nIf they don't, and I hope they don't, what happens when your baby is born? You're not going to be able to do all the cooking and cleaning. What if you have complications and you physically can't without ending up in the hospital?", "Sis, you have a bad husband.", "Girl take the baby and run", "In this situation \"bad wife\" = good mother, and person who generally doesn't put someone else's convenience and expectations above their own medical safety.", "Please stand up for yourself. You're carrying a baby inside you and your husband can't respect that? Unreal. You deserve so much better.", "Does your husband understand that this could kill you and your baby? Because that is the risk here. It isn\u2019t just unpleasant. It could be life threatening.", "**he\u2019s a bad husband.**", "I agree, this sounds cultural. Those friends and family need to get their asses over to her house and help her."]}
