Leave while you can.", "NTA.\n\nYou, your health, and your child, are at the very bottom of your husband's list of priorities; if you even make it.\n\nYou have complications and have been advised not to work or do any housework, and yet you are in a place where you have to continue both and your husband has not stepped up at all. At the very least he could step up and do all the housework for the next... let's say 6 months to get through pregnancy, birth, and some time to heal. 6 months as a minimum. \n\nIf it's cultural, which it sounds like, you have my deepest sympathies because that's not a fight you can win if husband is not on your side, and it sounds like he isn't.", "Poor thing. For what I've been reading is a cultural thing that you are expected to serve men even if you are basically sick. I wonder if there's anyone who can help you to cook one day a week, in bulk ant then just microwave food or that's too much for your husband to do? \n\nI think think the lack of kindness is not acceptable in any culture. I get some people is commenting in a very north western perspective but still... Bed rest is bed rest every culture. Get yourself admitted to a hospital and rest. I hope this way you get sick leave and still get pay and also others will cook and clean for you (and you'll avoid a miscarriage/NICU experience)", "NTA\nUnless the brother is there to do all the washing, cooking and house cleaning while he's there \nNot to mention how you will feel potentially going into labour with a house guest in such close proximity.\nIf your husband insists on this madness I would go back to family or tell your Dr you can't get bed rest at home and see if you can be admitted to hospital for yours and your child's safety \nYour husband is a giant selfish AH!", "Yeah this NTA\n\nAs a women who had 3 miscarriages between 12-16 weeks. Please please please take that bed rest thing serious. The 3 pregnancies of my 7 I had live children...were all early.  And I was on bed rest with all of them \n\nMy daughter born the earliest was at 34.5 weeks.  She couldn't retain her body heat. She couldn't breathe on her own at first. Had a low apgar score. And had failure to thrive.  And that was after they stopped my labor once. She is 22 now And still has a severe milk protein allergy that is related to this. When they say bed rest, they mean bed rest.  Please take it seriously", "\u201cBed rest\u201d is the prescription. OP should take it like she would any other medication. You can\u2019t just skip it because it\u2019s inconvenient. Dad needs to step up big time, and bro needs to find another place to stay.", "Yeah, this post just got worse and worse. WTF.\n\nOP is NTA. Except maybe to herself for staying with the biggest AH who doesn\u2019t care about her health or the baby\u2019s. And her pregnancy is likely only going to get harder as she gets bigger and has fatigue / mobility issues, which are both super common in the 3rd trimester.", "edit: The comment below was removed and the user banned, good work everyone!", "[removed]", "I feel they would blame her if she loses the baby. Specially if she's from a very patriarchal culture. Poor thing.", "That sounds so stressful, I\u2019m glad your daughter\u2019s doing well! I hope OP sees this, bed rest is super important", "Good bot", "He apparently doesn't consider the actual life of his wife or his unborn child....", "Peanut butter sandwiches honey. Ham sandwiches. Canned soup. DO NOT LET HIM MANIPULATE YOU INTO ALL THAT HOUSEWORK WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON BEDREST!!!", "How about you move out and 'let him' pay you child support?", "Does he realize that he is potentially risking your life and the life of your baby (depending upon the reason for bed rest) by doing so? Do you? I\u2019m very concerned about you not following your doctor\u2019s recommendation.", "And do you think this is ok? That he's willing to let his pregnant wife starve rather than get off his ass and cook something? That his personal comfort and whims take priority over your health and your child's life?", "NTA\n\nHe is manipulating you while you should be on bed rest. The fact that your work is more accommodating than your husband is a horrible situation you're in. \n\nEven in strict patriarchal cultures, the husband needs to pay attention to the wife's situation and circumstances. Obviously your husband isn't paying attention. It's one thing being pregnant, it's another having bed rest ordered by a doctor and not being able to take it. \n\nI'm being petty here, but he might deserve it. Is your MIL still around? Do you speak with her? If so, I wouldn't complain about your husband, but tell her your honest fear about your health and your child\u2019s/her grandchild's health. \n\nTell her that you want to provide everything for your husband, but it's taking a toll on your health and you're worried. Obviously you'd be manipulating the situation since you are seeking to get what you want (having his mom slipper whip him into taking better care of you) but you are being 100% honest with her, so it cancels it out?", "'Helping a bit' isn't good enough. If your husband can understand that pregnant women cannot clean out cat litter or lift heavy things, then he is capable of grasping the fact you need to be resting. It's concerning to me that you ending up in hospital wasn't enough for him to pull his finger out.\n\nThis situation really doesn't bode well for when your baby comes. If he cannot even manage doing more housework, do you really think he's going to step up as a parent?", "That's called manipulation. He's not dumb. He knows exactly what he's doing. A marriage is a partnership. The chores and house duties should not rely soley on you. What's going to happen when the baby is born? You'll be working full time, doing all the cooking/chores and you can bet your a** he won't do a d*** thing to help with the baby. He doesn't respect you.", "What is a worse label \"bad wife\" or \"mother to a dead child\"?\n\nDoctors don't recommend bed rest for funsies. \n\nDoes your husband not want a wife and child or is just OK risking your and your baby's life for his own selfish comfort?", "Girl, this isn't a funny situation.  This is abusive.", "I feel so bad for you that you\u2019ve been manipulated into even thinking that. Your husband is terrible. \n\nIt sounds like some cultural stuff is at play here but he needs to step it up, make your doctor talk to him if he\u2019ll take a doctor more seriously.", "It\u2019s so easy to say don\u2019t care about it, but I understand how manipulation works but you need to think about yourself and the baby now. You are the priority - make changes now if not it will be more difficult when the baby comes", "Is it worse to be\n* labeled a bad wife, or \n* to have a miscarriage because you were unable to be on ordered bed rest due to your bad husband?\n\nWhich matters to you more - the optics, or the pregnancy?", "Not to be mean but if you loose the baby they (hubby, his family etc) will say a lot worse. They will make it your fault and won't support you. I understand there are cultural difficulties here that I don't comprehend but you need to talk to people that can help you and do what you need for yourself and baby. Only you and baby matter here.", "Can you safely go home to your parents/family?", "You are married to a bad husband. Know this,  he will not help when the baby comes. You can't do it all and take care of him - and his brother, because that is what will happen. \n\nGet your money together and make a plan to please leave him. At least them you won't have to pick up after him and feed him. \n\nBless you, girl. I hope you figure this out and get some help.", "Sorry to be harsh but if you lose your baby because you refused to listen to the doctor that makes you a bad mother and the guilt will be horrible to bear.", "If being a 'bad wife' means also being a 'good mother' - taking medically advised bed-rest to have a healthy child - why not?", "Your husband\u2019s selfishness and laziness is putting you and your child at risk. You\u2019re a mother now - act like it.", "You are building a whole human.  That is enough work!!", "Okay then, be a bad wife, fuck him. He is a terrible husband. Absolutely fucking terrible husband.", "If being a bad wife is the price of being mother to a living baby, I would make the choice to be a bad wife every fucking time.", "Your husband is a bad husband who is making you risk your health and the life of your child, so he doesn\u2019t have to do basic adult tasks.

You know it, they know it, and this whole thread knows it. \n\n\nThe question for you is whether you want your child to grow up thinking it\u2019s normal - that women risk their health and safety so men don\u2019t have to do basic chores.", "He\u2019s being a bad husband, so who cares?", "Be the bad wife. And the bad mother. Isn\u2019t that the goal?

This is about your baby\u2019s life, possibly your own. He will survive bed rest, yall may not survive avoiding the rest. \n\nQuestion, given the cultural covering up. Does his momma know he\u2019s pulling this? My experience, those two can culturally overlap (but don't always), that pregnancy is sacred.", "I took that as her culture/friends and family. Not her husband in particular. The way she talks about her culture gets that implication imo."]}
