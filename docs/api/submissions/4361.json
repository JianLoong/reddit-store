My mom has never controlled any of her kids eating. I\u2019ve had an unhealthy relationship with food because of it, and having to learn to do good by my body. There\u2019s three of us. 22f, 32m, and 13f. I know. We\u2019re all ten years apart about. Crazy. My brother is out of the house and I\u2019m working on it. I hope to move out in the next few months. \n\nMy sister has zero portion control. My mom doesn\u2019t care. I bought a big three pack of cheese from Costco for thanksgiving. The Boursin ones, if you know. They\u2019re dense and good for sharing. Well, my sister ate all of them within a few days. She had no control and sharing in mind. \n\nThis is the same for all my favorite snacks I bring home see. So, sometimes I\u2019ll tuck them away or hide them in the garage for later only to be scolded. I don\u2019t want to eat at the rate that things disappear. If I buy a family size bag of my favorite chips, they\u2019ll be gone by the next afternoon if I don\u2019t touch them. I wish I was joking. \n\nI feel so stupid because it makes me feel greedy. I don\u2019t need the entirety of everything or anything really, but want *some*. When I ask her to leave some for me or to slow down, my mom scolds me for policing her eating habits. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I do just have to tuck something away if I don\u2019t want to eat it right away. \n\nI think in the past it\u2019s also caused me to binge eat. Furthermore, I\u2019m concerned about my sister\u2019s health. My mom and sister think I\u2019m an asshole for asking her to leave some of anything or share. If I eat two chips it\u2019s \u201cwell you had some of the bag too!\u201d But, it\u2019s a gigantic family bag my sister ate in a matter of hours. \n\nI can say it does make me upset and harsh, especially when I want period snacks, etc. I\u2019ll tell my sister that\u2019s enough and to eat a meal, I\u2019ll cook for her if she\u2019s really hungry. She needs real food. AITA for judging my sister\u2019s eating and hiding my own snacks?

The consequences already showed in how you grew up having an unhealthy relationship with food and it is beyond me how this woman can just continue to ruin another childs health and condone these eating habits. THREE packs of cheese in a couple days? 13 year olds are still growing, but this eating behaviour is concerning to say the least. And then telling YOU to stop \"berating\" your little sister. Your mother is definitely putting boundaries on the wrong child.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you bought the food and can choose how it is eaten. Frankly you should stop buying stuff or buy smaller quantities that you will eat so it won't be an issue.", "NTA it's wack your mom is defending your sisters eating habits.

You could also hide the food in alternate containers that are made to look like healthy food.", "NTA. Start \u201cborrowing\u201d your mom\u2019s stuff and don\u2019t give it back. If she complains, tell her you BOTH need to share.", "NTA for wanting to eat the food you pay for. I had roommates who thought anything I bought was free reign.

To be honest, there is nothing you're going to be able to do in regards to policing your sister's habits, as your mom won't listen.\n\nI would take your sister out and have a heart-to-heart. I have a binge eating disorder as well, and the only way I have learned to cope is by binging on HEALTHY foods that won't cause as much damage. If you're noticing binge eating behaviors, maybe say you went through something similar too and developed an unhealthy relationship to food.\n\nDo NOT focus on how she looks. Making the conversation about her weight is going to be plain rude and unproductive. Talk about healthy eating habits.", "NTA. \n\n1) Your food is your food. If you buy something for yourself, other people shouldn't eat it (especially all of it) without asking you if they can have some. She's 13, so she should be old enough to understand that.

Is it only your food that she devours or is it everything?\n\n2) It doesn't even sound like you're trying to police your sister's weight at all like your mom seems to think. You just ask her to leave some of your food for you.

I would focus on getting yourself out of there ASAP. I get that it is more cost effective to buy some things at Costco but for now I wouldn't do it.", "NTA You're not greedy for guarding your snacks. That's ridiculous. You worked and payed for them. They're yours, every bit as much as a DVD, game, book, furniture, and etc., would be yours. Teach her how to cook if she's willing, but feel free to bluntly tell her and your negligent mother that your shit is, in fact, your shit.", "nta, this happened to my sister and I when we were adults living at home, her more than me. she ended up clearing a shelf in the room as a pantry and got a mini fridge. having ppl be completely inconsiderate of your food (i remember also being so upset bec foods so expensive!!!!!) is really frustrating, i would take matters into your own hands until you can move out", "Your sister 5'6\" and 200 + lbs is not a good image ?  Sounds like she needs professional help ?", "If you're buying it, she shouldn't be touching it without asking.\n\nNTA", "NTA we used to put candycanes on our tree and my sister would eat all of them before I got a chance to have any so I started to hide some. \n\nBefore I started hiding some, I would have had 2-3 candy canes out of 2 boxes. After hiding some I got 5 or 6. (She knew I was hiding them and would look for them)\n\nPoint being, eating all of something is rude, if you can\u2019t control it, then stuff gets hidden from you", "Lol NTA. I hide snacks from my husband all the time.  We do what we must!", "Wow. I absolutely understand you. During my teen years living with  both of my brothers, 4 years apart each, it was a struggle with saving food for later. \n\nI would always beg them to not eat it, but every time I would wake up looking forward to having my snack the next day, it would be gone. Honestly, now that you put it that way, maybe this was part of what made me become a bit on the chubby side. I would stop saving stuff, and eat it as soon as possible so as to not let anyone steal it from me. \n\nWow, this is honestly an eye opening realization... Either way, I have worked on myself and fixed some of the damage, but some of it still lingers.", "NTA", "I think hiding the food is a good strategy for protecting OP\u2019s stash to ensure OP has her snacks when she wants them.  \n\nBut I think hiding the food is a *bad* strategy for controlling the girl\u2019s food intake. Using external control on someone who\u2019s 13 will stunt their development of internal control. And hiding food isn\u2019t even mere external control, it\u2019s external manipulation. It turns snack time into a treasure hunt.  \n\nSorted from worse to better (for the 13 year old\u2019s development):  \n\n* 1: Hide the food\n* 2: Lock up the food in a known place\n* 3: Let the food be physically accessible but forbid access and apply some punishment if she violates that boundary\n* 4: Grant her free access to the food and actively reward her for self restraint\n* 5: Grant her free access and teach her to value self restraint\n* 6: Grant her free access and teach her to value health and fitness\n* 7: Give her total freedom and let her form her own opinions about the relationship between health and life satisfaction\n\nBasically each level here is less external control and more internal control as the mechanism. The constraints on the process are (1) a strategy requiring more internal control than the girl possesses will fail, (2) a strategy utilizing less internal control than the girl possesses will weaken her internal control, and (3) eventually she will exist at level 7 whether she\u2019s ready for it or not (when she\u2019s moved out).  \n\nBasically parents (and older siblings involved in parenting-type rearing decisions) should be striving to move up one level at a time, fast enough to hit level 7 by the time she moves out but slow enough so that she can handle each transition without draining her daily willpower budget developing the new mental habits.", "Exactly. There are no savings in buying larger sizes if you don't get to eat it.", "It\u2019s not *only* my food, it\u2019s whatever she wants. It\u2019s more of if I buy myself a treat or something special I\u2019ve been craving, she eats it. This is never true for healthy foods because she\u2019s picky. I have tried to help her learn to cook but she\u2019s not interested, and is even reluctant to microwave her own leftovers.", "Where did you get those numbers?

Since my food was all separate my parents realized my brother ate like 90% of the food & I was finally not blamed for eating all of the food. (That I couldn\u2019t even eat half the time due to a medical condition that causes me to be unable to eat). This was a temporary measure and I am now out of the house but keeping a dorm fridge & my food separate really helped me out.", "I\u2019m glad we could realize this together.

OP is completely allowed to focus on her own needs. It\u2019s just that OP mentioned the goal of helping her sister, and spent a good portion of the post framing this in terms of her sister\u2019s health.\n\nOP\u2019s responsibility is whatever responsibility she chooses to adopt.", "First NTA. But also is it possible your sister has some intestinal issue like IBS? I was more polite and considerate about my consumption but could absolutely binge eat. It was cause of missed fired signals my stomach would send when hungry and when not hungry after. It sucked ass. But as an adult I got on medication that blocks the signal for the most part and it helped so much", "NTA buy a safe or something you can lock and lock your food in there. While I totally get pitching in for food costs you still deserve to have some of what you\u2019re buying. If she can\u2019t respect that then she loses privileges to YOUR food.", "NTA. This was a very similar situation that I had when I was living at home, except it was my younger brother. My parents had the same response and I felt like I just had to eat it in order to taste it. If I bought something with my money, I would write my name in sharpie on the food, but I can see this potentially not going well in your house. \n\nI do think moving out will be the right choice. I also developed a pretty unhealthy relationship with food in this type of environment, and my relationship with food has gotten significantly better since leaving home. I definitely would binge at first, but when you learn there\u2019s no competition, you start to eat at your pace. And yes everyone is different, but I just want to say this so you know moving out will help reverse some of those problems with food.", "NTA. Take ur snacks in ur room and if u can afford it id invest in a mini fridge. I deal with binge eating now because of stuff like this.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is not doing your sister any favors, if she doesn't already have an eating disorder, she will have, not to mention various health problems.\n\nIt's good that you're working on moving out, that will probably be the best thing you can do for yourself.", "And your sisters stuff", "None of the methods work if that actual parent doesn't help, OP get scolded for trying anything already.", "NTA. She's old enough to know how to share and your mom shouldn't be enabling it. Also if.you pay.for.it, it's your decision whether it gets shared or not. Keep it in a lock box in your room to drive the point home.", "NTA. Have you ever heard of defensive eating because that\u2019s what your sister is going to drive you to. I think anyone who had siblings growing up has a tiny bit of this, I know I did, but that\u2019s sibling rivalry for you. But you need to hide your food. Your car is probably a good hiding place if your family has no access to it if you keep your keys on you. There are ways to lock food away so only you can access it, but that\u2019s usually roommate situations not family where it will become more of problem.   \nBut your NTA just figure out a way to survive until you move out. Whether that\u2019s hiding your food, locking it away, or buying smaller more individual portions that you eat in the moment. You won\u2019t win this fight without a parent on your side. Where is your dad in this?", "NTA. Who bought the food? You! Honestly I\u2019d even recommend buying a lock bin and storing all of your snacks in there. If sis wants some she can ask, and then you can give her as much as you want by pouring it into a bowl. If mom gets annoyed, then stop eating their snacks and only eat your own.\n\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re concerned for her health, but if your mom and sis are going to be bratty about it, then just ignore them.", "NTA.\nAlso me and my older sisters are ten years apart as well, so your not alone on that front! \ud83d\ude01", "I literally have lived in this situation with my whole family, and though it got better when they started dieting, I am still a snack hoarder and ration my chosen snacks out fairly harshly.

Don't buy snack food unless you can store it somewhere that's not at home.\n\nAlso does anyone there actually plan meals? Because snacking all day isn't particularly healthy.", "NTA \n\nTell your mom to start limiting your sisters intake, since the amount she\u2019s eating isn\u2019t healthy, or you\u2019ll stop grocery shopping for them.
