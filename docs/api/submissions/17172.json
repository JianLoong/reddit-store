{"id": 17172, "submission_id": "13gz7r0", "title": "AITA for wanting a separate Christmas without my sister's kids?", "selftext": "I M28 have several siblings all about my age. Only my youngest sister F25 has kids, of which she has 5. I have nothing wrong with my sister wanting to be a mom and I love my nieces and nephews, but I can't be around them much. \n\nI have a medical condition that can cause seizures when I'm overstimulated, and generally messes me up if I can't leave to decompress. When we visit our parents for the holidays, I'll hang out with my other siblings and their spouses, then when my sister shows up with her husband I'll greet them, visit for a minute, then put in my headphones and go somewhere else when noise picks up. If it was a normal level of chaos it might even be okay (I'm pretty fine with the adults laughing and talking), but she'll bring loud toys, turn on CocoMelon, and let the kids run wild. I can't handle it for too long without having to bail, and asking for things to be quieter is usually met with \"ha, try LIVING with this!\" Not very productive.\n\nIt sucks getting to visit with my family for maybe two hours and then basically having to leave the party. I've tried catching up with people away from the group, but my sister takes it personally and keeps asking why I don't want to talk to her and her husband. She knows about the seizures, I just think something isn't clicking in her brain even though I keep explaining why I can't stick around.\n\nLast year we had bad weather, and my sister couldn't drive from out of state to come to the Christmas party. Most of us were already at our parents' place when she texted, so we just had the party anyway and planned a follow-up for them in a couple weeks. It ended up being a blast! I actually got to stay for the whole thing! I didn't mind a bit that I had to hang out in the kitchen for most of the second party--I got the fun out of my system and was just happy to see my sister and meet her new baby.\n\nWhen my sister found out that we basically did Christmas without her, she was understandably upset. She and her kids still had presents to open and we had a nice lunch, but there wasn't the same adult party she'd hoped she could join. Granted, her \"joining the adults\" was her unleashing her kids and getting tipsy while our parents struggled to keep them from destroying their house, but I get it. Getting left out sucks.\n\nThat being said, I loved having two parties, and I asked my dad about doing this every year. While he also enjoyed the adults party, we both agreed that splitting up Christmas would really upset my sister. Living out of state with that many kids, it's basically impossible for her to do both parties. We tried to think of other options, but most of us spend New Year with our spouses, and my sister would be furious if she found out we didn't invite her to a non-holiday family party. I just don't think it's fair that I practically have to skip Christmas half the time because she has so many rowdy kids.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for wanting a separate party?

If that\u2019s not possible do the 2 parties till her kids are old enough to learn manners and follow rules.", "NTA.\n\nI'm confused by this voting section. \n\nYour sister is actively ignoring and downplaying your disability while also being rude to you about your lack of engagement with them-- a lack of engagement directly caused by the effect of her poor parenting on your disability. Her behavior towards you is staggeringly not okay. You deserve to get a Christmas with your family as much as she does, and you're the one whose existence isn't annoying for everyone else. \n\nLots of people do one full family and one adults only event, especially when there aren't many kids in the family. It would be totally okay to say \"cocktails for the adults on Saturday and family dinner on Sunday,\" and if they can't come, they can't come. Them's the breaks when you choose to have kids. \n\nLying to her or excluding them fully is asinine. Just make a kid-free rule, and if she throws a fit tell her to suck it up. I feel like you're making this out to be much more dramatic than it actually is. \n\nAlso, your parents should be the ones to tell her that she needs to get her kids under control, and that her treatment of you/willful refusal to take your disability seriously is unacceptable. Just because she's an adult doesn't mean they have to let her act like an ass.", "NTA, having two parties is perfectly fine. One where the family can do family christmas and one where adults can have a relaxing party. if it is okay for you to be excluded, it is fine for the sister to be excluded. just plan it around sometime before or after you sister is there.", "Clarification: My suggestion was not for my sister to skip Christmas and just do a makeup party later, which was sort of the case this last year. I wanted to see if it was possible to do an adults-only party separate from the regular celebration with the kids and everyone. I just know my sister couldn't make both and would be upset if we had a family party she couldn't come to. It doesn't even need to be Christmas, but my siblings live all over and I'd like to get a chance to see them and visit, maybe a few weeks before or after actual Christmas, without it upsetting my sister. I love her, I want to include her and her kids, but I also want to be able to enjoy the holidays without it risking my health. If she and her husband could find someone willing to babysit 5 kids under age 5 for an adults-only party, they'd be more than welcome to come.", "Maybe try going early or the day before and when your sister and kids are there u wont be there... health is more important and of your parents and other siblings cant get her to control her kids and respect other peoples homes when they go to friends they won't  be welcome...u have to respect other peoples property.. also think of people health", "I see you and the rest of your family enjoyed the child free party. Unfortunately, constantly leaving out a sibling can cause a major rift. You have a medical condition that hinders your enjoyment of situations where you are more likely to be overstimulated. I imagine it would peak where there are several children causing a raucous or even at a theme park or concert where sound and lights and activity are all at a 10. \n\nWhile you take care of yourself to not need medical attention, your sister on the other hand refuses to parent. 5 kids is a lot, and it\u2019s not as if she doesn\u2019t have time to get a sitter and drink on her own time over the rest of the year. Not only does she not parent the children, but you did not mention a spouse in this situation. Can the other parent not take over? Who is teaching them how to follow rules, act in public, be good humans? \n\nESH. There has to be some parenting done, and your sister needs to be in that conversation as well.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nThis might be a dreadful suggestion, but has your sister ever actually witnessed a seizure? It might be worth engineering one when she's around so she can see just how awful they are.  I have similar health issues (meltdowns, also a really dodgy gut) and my brother and his wife honestly didn't realise just how bad they were until they saw both first hand. It made them a lot more accommodating.\n\nHowever I realise it's an extreme suggestion and you may need to enroll the rest of your family to support you.", "NTA for enjoying the peace you had. YTA for actually wanting to exclude your sister. The condition is yours, therefore you're the one who needs to make accommodations for yourself. It isn't her responsibility to ensure you don't have a seizure. It would be nice if she could keep the kids calm but anyone with kids (especially five) knows this is extremely unlikely.", "YTA, this is your medical issue and it\u2019s not your sister & her kids fault. \n\nIt must be tough having 5 kids (it\u2019s not for me lol) and they\u2019re gonna make a shit ton of noise! It\u2019s also not fair that she be excluded.", "Unfortunately YTA. You can't exclude them. They're family. Why not try showing up early? Say the party is from 5pm onward, can you ask to come at 3 or 4 to get some extra time in with at least your parents? Or make the party extend later so when your sister and her kids need to leave for bedtime, you can stay and catch up with whoever else? Is there not an area of the house you can set up as a play room with super fun stuff or a tent or something to encourage the kids to be a bit farther from your earshot? Surely there's a workaround here that doesn't exclude anyone.", "So ...because you have an issue and you don't think it's fair that YOUR issue causes you to miss out on family time your solution is to exclude your sister? \n\nHAHAHHAHAHAHHA\n\n\nYTA", "Info please. You have seizures from being around active children?", "A big fat AH. Yep that\u2019s you. Excluding your family at a family event. Perhaps they should just exclude you instead. You can have your peace and quiet all alone.", ">Granted, her \"joining the adults\" was her unleashing her kids and getting tipsy while our parents struggled to keep them from destroying their house, but I get it. Getting left out sucks.\n\nNo, she's an asshole but you're not getting a separate party. You have a good reason for it with your medical condition but she has five grandkids.

Maybe you could do an adults Christmas leftovers party when she and the kids have left?  That way it isn't a big \"thing.\"", "I am pretty surprised at he level of vehemence in some of these Y T A votes.\n\nOp ends up excluded from most holidays due to inconsideration of her medical issue, something they have little to no control over, and the control they do have is removing themselves. So, by happenstance they finally have a nice holiday, and later ask if there's a way to make that happen more. Is excluding the sister the answer? Maybe not (though it does sound like some parenting needs to come into play), but I don't blame Op for wanting to enjoy holidays with family. \n\nWhy so harsh ya'll?\n\nGoing with NTA I think.", "Rational response.", "When a childless person says the kids are \"destroying\" the house take it with a GIANT grain of salt. I'm sure they're acting like totally normal kids.", "I don\u2019t know where your sister lives but finding a sitter, for 5 kids, under 5 would either cost the earth or you\u2019d struggle to find someone.", "I think if it were possible for her to see one in private it might convince her that they are a real problem, but her kids are at an age where I think it would be terrifying for them to see. If their uncle just dropped and started short circuiting I'm worried it would be pandemonium. Maybe if things get to an extreme it might be something to consider, but I'd like to avoid it if I can.", "Op said they didn't want to exclude the sister? Op also states that they would take suggestions to help not exclude their sister so idk where the YTA is coming from.", "my mother has 4 kids and never one time has any one ever complained about us, every person house who we\u2019ve ever been to had raved about how respectful and well behaved we our. \n\nshe mentioned the parents are always trying to keep the kids from destroying their home, which isn\u2019t just kid behavior. we were taught to respect others things", "This isn't a bad idea. Maybe it could be the standard that it's sort of an \"adults morning\" and people have the option to show up early for the quieter half of the party. My parents and I are all morning people, I have no issue with that. Maybe I could help cook and set up too, which would give us time to hang out.", "Wow, you seem like a delight of a human. You\u2019re laughing at someone who has fucking seizures when they are overstimulated, making it difficult and potentially dangerous for them to be around that many small children all day. You\u2019re laughing at someone for their medical condition and reducing it down to \u201cYOUR issue\u201d, as if OP has decided they have an irrational fear of peas and refuses to attend until peas are off the menu for everyone. \n\nAnd don\u2019t tell me seizures aren\u2019t dangerous - they can be fucking fatal, I\u2019ve lost a friend to a head injury sustained as a direct result of a seizure. \n\nOP and their sister have different access needs but both should feel able to spend time feeling comfortable and with their family. An adults only event every once in a while sounds completely reasonable. OP isn\u2019t asking for every event, or Christmas Day itself. Just ONCE IN A WHILE that events happen without kids so they can fully participate.\n\nAnd the sister isn\u2019t even excluded from that event, that\u2019s the really awesome part of what OP has suggested. Because, while OP does not have a way to just decide to turn off their seizures, the sister DOES have a way to take a day or evening off from taking care of her kids to join in the adult only party. She could hire a babysitter, ask the children\u2019s father to care for them while she attends the event, she could ask the paternal grandparents or aunts/uncles to babysit. It might not be convenient, but the sister DOES have options to change her situation. OP does not have that luxury. So if it\u2019s important enough to her to attend the adults only event, she can find a way to make it happen. Otherwise, she needs to sit down, shut up and accept that OP also has a right to spend time with their parents and siblings - especially when it sounds like everyone else enjoyed having a get together without her kids changing the vibe.", "My neurologist suspects I have PNES which are non-epileptic seizures that can be caused sometimes by general stress and overstimulation. It's not specifically kids, I have trouble in crowded public places or anywhere with lots of light, noise, and activity with no buffer in between. In short bursts it would be completely fine, but I get fatigued over the day and am more susceptible to it if it goes on for a long time. I completely understand that this isn't my sister's fault--I do what I can do work around it and still visit with everyone, but if I have a seizure I'll probably be out for the rest of the night, if not the following day too. It's not as severe as epilepsy, but it can be debilitating.", "But it's okay if OP is excluded from the event? He has to leave early to prevent a potential seizure.", "Completely agree, especially during the holidays", "OPs sister is 25. You think her kids are old enough to be \"respectful\"? She probably has a baby, a toddler, and some very young kids. A toddler doesn't understand to not destroy things yet. Kids need to be taught these skills before they can be praised as being \"respectful\". I suspect they're normal kids doing normal kid things and OPs sister is trying to enjoy a few minutes to herself while the grandparents help out.", "Ok, I'm not being a jerk here, but are you in therapy?? I am familiar with PNES  pseudo'seizures', and it is psychological. They are not real 'seizures', but can resemble one and feel like they are real to you, but is not. Possibly due to something from your past?  Again, are you in therapy?", "He\u2019s the first one to mention the idea. How would he like it if they do the same thing to him?", "So why say if they found a sitter they\u2019d be more than welcome? Will you be providing some cash towards this?", "I mean, yeah, there's a certain amount of noise that's normal with kids, but that doesn't mean you can't at least *attempt* to mitigate it. The loud toys and shows are an active choice on the sister's part. Are you telling me that there are *zero* activity options that would reduce the chaos?", "The kids are 5, 4, 3, 22 months, and 6 months", "They effectively are. They\u2019re aware of the medical condition that OP is asking the rest of the family to accommodate so they get to have some family time. They just don\u2019t seem to give a shit as long as they are catered to. \n\nKnowing that your kids (through no fault of their own) could cause your sibling to have a dangerous medical event and still trying to use your kids to block that sibling from spending time with their family is vile behaviour. If the sister wants to participate in the adult only get together, she can leave the kids with their dad, other set of grandparents, aunts or uncles, or hire a babysitter. OP can\u2019t turn their seizures off. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even a forever situation, because children grow. This only needs to be the arrangement until her kids are old enough to consistently remember to use their inside voices and play calmly instead of tearing through the house like tiny hurricanes, making enough noise to raise the dead as they go. (Which again, given the ages of the kids, is not surprising. They\u2019re all little still, there will be chaos and noise, and, well, there\u2019s 5 of them, so probably at least 3 are hyperactive/upset/crying/fighting/shrieking/playing with a loud toy at any given time).", "Presumably the husband has parents or family.\n\nIt\u2019s not that unusual.", "That's the problem, I can't afford it and they can't either. It's not a very inclusive solution, so I'm looking for suggestions", "Would just the normal running around and crying trigger an episodes or is it the combo of that PLUS the loud shows PLUS the obnoxious toys, etc? There's a certain amount of noise that you won't be able to get rid of with kids, but certainly some of what's happening is an active choice on your sister's part", "Lol exactly! I'm sorry but a 6 month old is going to cry. A 22 month old is going to run around grabbing shit. A 3 year old is gonna be loud AF. Kids are kids. I don't think the comments assuming OPs sister is some terrible parent are justified.", "It would absolutely be possible for her to not turn on the television and not bring noisy toys, or even just let me go hang out on the porch and chat with other people without getting angry that everyone left her inside. It really seems like she either doesn't understand my condition or thinks I'm lying about it to avoid her. My parents and other siblings see me more often, they know about the full impact it's had on my life. My mom even scolded her when she was venting about how rude I was (I had gone home by this point) because I can't help it. Being completely honest, my other siblings don't like the noise either and will often gravitate to other parts of the house. My sister DOES get ditched sometimes to stick to whatever home base she's set up with the baby stuff, but I think there are definitely ways we could make the space more accessible to me without completely removing her.", "The kids are incredibly sweet and I love them, but yeah they are absolutely toddlers and nothing can help that lol. I don't think my sister is an awful parent, just sort of...hands off. Being a mom of five I COMPLETELY get needing a break and just wanting to relax and enjoy time with your siblings, but she just kind of sets them down and ignores them until someone needs a diaper change. Her husband isn't much better, he mostly plays on his phone.", "Totally agree, these kids are just being kids."]}
