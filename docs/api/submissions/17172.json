Only my youngest sister F25 has kids, of which she has 5. I have nothing wrong with my sister wanting to be a mom and I love my nieces and nephews, but I can't be around them much. \n\nI have a medical condition that can cause seizures when I'm overstimulated, and generally messes me up if I can't leave to decompress. When we visit our parents for the holidays, I'll hang out with my other siblings and their spouses, then when my sister shows up with her husband I'll greet them, visit for a minute, then put in my headphones and go somewhere else when noise picks up. If it was a normal level of chaos it might even be okay (I'm pretty fine with the adults laughing and talking), but she'll bring loud toys, turn on CocoMelon, and let the kids run wild. I can't handle it for too long without having to bail, and asking for things to be quieter is usually met with \"ha, try LIVING with this!\" Not very productive.\n\nIt sucks getting to visit with my family for maybe two hours and then basically having to leave the party. I've tried catching up with people away from the group, but my sister takes it personally and keeps asking why I don't want to talk to her and her husband. She knows about the seizures, I just think something isn't clicking in her brain even though I keep explaining why I can't stick around.\n\nLast year we had bad weather, and my sister couldn't drive from out of state to come to the Christmas party. Most of us were already at our parents' place when she texted, so we just had the party anyway and planned a follow-up for them in a couple weeks. It ended up being a blast! I actually got to stay for the whole thing! I didn't mind a bit that I had to hang out in the kitchen for most of the second party--I got the fun out of my system and was just happy to see my sister and meet her new baby.\n\nWhen my sister found out that we basically did Christmas without her, she was understandably upset. She and her kids still had presents to open and we had a nice lunch, but there wasn't the same adult party she'd hoped she could join. Granted, her \"joining the adults\" was her unleashing her kids and getting tipsy while our parents struggled to keep them from destroying their house, but I get it. Getting left out sucks.\n\nThat being said, I loved having two parties, and I asked my dad about doing this every year. While he also enjoyed the adults party, we both agreed that splitting up Christmas would really upset my sister. Living out of state with that many kids, it's basically impossible for her to do both parties. We tried to think of other options, but most of us spend New Year with our spouses, and my sister would be furious if she found out we didn't invite her to a non-holiday family party. I just don't think it's fair that I practically have to skip Christmas half the time because she has so many rowdy kids.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for wanting a separate party?

If that\u2019s not possible do the 2 parties till her kids are old enough to learn manners and follow rules.", "NTA.\n\nI'm confused by this voting section. \n\nYour sister is actively ignoring and downplaying your disability while also being rude to you about your lack of engagement with them-- a lack of engagement directly caused by the effect of her poor parenting on your disability. Her behavior towards you is staggeringly not okay. You deserve to get a Christmas with your family as much as she does, and you're the one whose existence isn't annoying for everyone else. \n\nLots of people do one full family and one adults only event, especially when there aren't many kids in the family. It would be totally okay to say \"cocktails for the adults on Saturday and family dinner on Sunday,\" and if they can't come, they can't come. Them's the breaks when you choose to have kids. \n\nLying to her or excluding them fully is asinine. Just make a kid-free rule, and if she throws a fit tell her to suck it up. I feel like you're making this out to be much more dramatic than it actually is. \n\nAlso, your parents should be the ones to tell her that she needs to get her kids under control, and that her treatment of you/willful refusal to take your disability seriously is unacceptable. Just because she's an adult doesn't mean they have to let her act like an ass.", "NTA, having two parties is perfectly fine. One where the family can do family christmas and one where adults can have a relaxing party. if it is okay for you to be excluded, it is fine for the sister to be excluded. just plan it around sometime before or after you sister is there.", "Clarification: My suggestion was not for my sister to skip Christmas and just do a makeup party later, which was sort of the case this last year. I wanted to see if it was possible to do an adults-only party separate from the regular celebration with the kids and everyone. I just know my sister couldn't make both and would be upset if we had a family party she couldn't come to. It doesn't even need to be Christmas, but my siblings live all over and I'd like to get a chance to see them and visit, maybe a few weeks before or after actual Christmas, without it upsetting my sister. I love her, I want to include her and her kids, but I also want to be able to enjoy the holidays without it risking my health.

Unfortunately, constantly leaving out a sibling can cause a major rift. You have a medical condition that hinders your enjoyment of situations where you are more likely to be overstimulated. I imagine it would peak where there are several children causing a raucous or even at a theme park or concert where sound and lights and activity are all at a 10. \n\nWhile you take care of yourself to not need medical attention, your sister on the other hand refuses to parent. 5 kids is a lot, and it\u2019s not as if she doesn\u2019t have time to get a sitter and drink on her own time over the rest of the year. Not only does she not parent the children, but you did not mention a spouse in this situation. Can the other parent not take over? Who is teaching them how to follow rules, act in public, be good humans? \n\nESH. There has to be some parenting done, and your sister needs to be in that conversation as well.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nThis might be a dreadful suggestion, but has your sister ever actually witnessed a seizure? It might be worth engineering one when she's around so she can see just how awful they are.  I have similar health issues (meltdowns, also a really dodgy gut) and my brother and his wife honestly didn't realise just how bad they were until they saw both first hand. It made them a lot more accommodating.\n\nHowever I realise it's an extreme suggestion and you may need to enroll the rest of your family to support you.", "NTA for enjoying the peace you had. YTA for actually wanting to exclude your sister. The condition is yours, therefore you're the one who needs to make accommodations for yourself. It isn't her responsibility to ensure you don't have a seizure. It would be nice if she could keep the kids calm but anyone with kids (especially five) knows this is extremely unlikely.", "YTA, this is your medical issue and it\u2019s not your sister & her kids fault. \n\nIt must be tough having 5 kids (it\u2019s not for me lol) and they\u2019re gonna make a shit ton of noise! It\u2019s also not fair that she be excluded.", "Unfortunately YTA. You can't exclude them. They're family. Why not try showing up early? Say the party is from 5pm onward, can you ask to come at 3 or 4 to get some extra time in with at least your parents? Or make the party extend later so when your sister and her kids need to leave for bedtime, you can stay and catch up with whoever else? Is there not an area of the house you can set up as a play room with super fun stuff or a tent or something to encourage the kids to be a bit farther from your earshot? Surely there's a workaround here that doesn't exclude anyone.", "So ...because you have an issue and you don't think it's fair that YOUR issue causes you to miss out on family time your solution is to exclude your sister? \n\nHAHAHHAHAHAHHA\n\n\nYTA", "Info please. You have seizures from being around active children?", "A big fat AH. Yep that\u2019s you. Excluding your family at a family event. Perhaps they should just exclude you instead. You can have your peace and quiet all alone.", ">Granted, her \"joining the adults\" was her unleashing her kids and getting tipsy while our parents struggled to keep them from destroying their house, but I get it.

If their uncle just dropped and started short circuiting I'm worried it would be pandemonium. Maybe if things get to an extreme it might be something to consider, but I'd like to avoid it if I can.", "Op said they didn't want to exclude the sister? Op also states that they would take suggestions to help not exclude their sister so idk where the YTA is coming from.", "my mother has 4 kids and never one time has any one ever complained about us, every person house who we\u2019ve ever been to had raved about how respectful and well behaved we our. \n\nshe mentioned the parents are always trying to keep the kids from destroying their home, which isn\u2019t just kid behavior. we were taught to respect others things", "This isn't a bad idea. Maybe it could be the standard that it's sort of an \"adults morning\" and people have the option to show up early for the quieter half of the party. My parents and I are all morning people, I have no issue with that. Maybe I could help cook and set up too, which would give us time to hang out.", "Wow, you seem like a delight of a human. You\u2019re laughing at someone who has fucking seizures when they are overstimulated, making it difficult and potentially dangerous for them to be around that many small children all day. You\u2019re laughing at someone for their medical condition and reducing it down to \u201cYOUR issue\u201d, as if OP has decided they have an irrational fear of peas and refuses to attend until peas are off the menu for everyone. \n\nAnd don\u2019t tell me seizures aren\u2019t dangerous - they can be fucking fatal, I\u2019ve lost a friend to a head injury sustained as a direct result of a seizure. \n\nOP and their sister have different access needs but both should feel able to spend time feeling comfortable and with their family. An adults only event every once in a while sounds completely reasonable. OP isn\u2019t asking for every event, or Christmas Day itself. Just ONCE IN A WHILE that events happen without kids so they can fully participate.\n\nAnd the sister isn\u2019t even excluded from that event, that\u2019s the really awesome part of what OP has suggested. Because, while OP does not have a way to just decide to turn off their seizures, the sister DOES have a way to take a day or evening off from taking care of her kids to join in the adult only party. She could hire a babysitter, ask the children\u2019s father to care for them while she attends the event, she could ask the paternal grandparents or aunts/uncles to babysit. It might not be convenient, but the sister DOES have options to change her situation. OP does not have that luxury. So if it\u2019s important enough to her to attend the adults only event, she can find a way to make it happen. Otherwise, she needs to sit down, shut up and accept that OP also has a right to spend time with their parents and siblings - especially when it sounds like everyone else enjoyed having a get together without her kids changing the vibe.", "My neurologist suspects I have PNES which are non-epileptic seizures that can be caused sometimes by general stress and overstimulation. It's not specifically kids, I have trouble in crowded public places or anywhere with lots of light, noise, and activity with no buffer in between. In short bursts it would be completely fine, but I get fatigued over the day and am more susceptible to it if it goes on for a long time. I completely understand that this isn't my sister's fault--I do what I can do work around it and still visit with everyone, but if I have a seizure I'll probably be out for the rest of the night, if not the following day too. It's not as severe as epilepsy, but it can be debilitating.", "But it's okay if OP is excluded from the event? He has to leave early to prevent a potential seizure.", "Completely agree, especially during the holidays", "OPs sister is 25. You think her kids are old enough to be \"respectful\"? She probably has a baby, a toddler, and some very young kids. A toddler doesn't understand to not destroy things yet. Kids need to be taught these skills before they can be praised as being \"respectful\". I suspect they're normal kids doing normal kid things and OPs sister is trying to enjoy a few minutes to herself while the grandparents help out.", "Ok, I'm not being a jerk here, but are you in therapy?? I am familiar with PNES  pseudo'seizures', and it is psychological. They are not real 'seizures', but can resemble one and feel like they are real to you, but is not. Possibly due to something from your past?  Again, are you in therapy?", "He\u2019s the first one to mention the idea. How would he like it if they do the same thing to him?", "So why say if they found a sitter they\u2019d be more than welcome? Will you be providing some cash towards this?", "I mean, yeah, there's a certain amount of noise that's normal with kids, but that doesn't mean you can't at least *attempt* to mitigate it. The loud toys and shows are an active choice on the sister's part. Are you telling me that there are *zero* activity options that would reduce the chaos?", "The kids are 5, 4, 3, 22 months, and 6 months", "They effectively are. They\u2019re aware of the medical condition that OP is asking the rest of the family to accommodate so they get to have some family time. They just don\u2019t seem to give a shit as long as they are catered to. \n\nKnowing that your kids (through no fault of their own) could cause your sibling to have a dangerous medical event and still trying to use your kids to block that sibling from spending time with their family is vile behaviour. If the sister wants to participate in the adult only get together, she can leave the kids with their dad, other set of grandparents, aunts or uncles, or hire a babysitter. OP can\u2019t turn their seizures off. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even a forever situation, because children grow. This only needs to be the arrangement until her kids are old enough to consistently remember to use their inside voices and play calmly instead of tearing through the house like tiny hurricanes, making enough noise to raise the dead as they go. (Which again, given the ages of the kids, is not surprising. They\u2019re all little still, there will be chaos and noise, and, well, there\u2019s 5 of them, so probably at least 3 are hyperactive/upset/crying/fighting/shrieking/playing with a loud toy at any given time).", "Presumably the husband has parents or family.\n\nIt\u2019s not that unusual.", "That's the problem, I can't afford it and they can't either. It's not a very inclusive solution, so I'm looking for suggestions", "Would just the normal running around and crying trigger an episodes or is it the combo of that PLUS the loud shows PLUS the obnoxious toys, etc? There's a certain amount of noise that you won't be able to get rid of with kids, but certainly some of what's happening is an active choice on your sister's part", "Lol exactly! I'm sorry but a 6 month old is going to cry. A 22 month old is going to run around grabbing shit. A 3 year old is gonna be loud AF. Kids are kids. I don't think the comments assuming OPs sister is some terrible parent are justified.", "It would absolutely be possible for her to not turn on the television and not bring noisy toys, or even just let me go hang out on the porch and chat with other people without getting angry that everyone left her inside. It really seems like she either doesn't understand my condition or thinks I'm lying about it to avoid her. My parents and other siblings see me more often, they know about the full impact it's had on my life. My mom even scolded her when she was venting about how rude I was (I had gone home by this point) because I can't help it. Being completely honest, my other siblings don't like the noise either and will often gravitate to other parts of the house. My sister DOES get ditched sometimes to stick to whatever home base she's set up with the baby stuff, but I think there are definitely ways we could make the space more accessible to me without completely removing her.", "The kids are incredibly sweet and I love them, but yeah they are absolutely toddlers and nothing can help that lol. I don't think my sister is an awful parent, just sort of...hands off. Being a mom of five I COMPLETELY get needing a break and just wanting to relax and enjoy time with your siblings, but she just kind of sets them down and ignores them until someone needs a diaper change. Her husband isn't much better, he mostly plays on his phone.", "Totally agree, these kids are just being kids.", "So your parents are okay with seeing you for only a couple hours every single holiday because parenting is inconvenient for your sister? That is completely crazy. \n\nI would have dropped an ultimatum after the very first time that they had the following options: the sister actually keep her children at a reasonable volume, there are two parties, or they can accept not seeing you at another party until your sister\u2019s kids grow up enough to realise that they need to stop behaving badly on their own since their mother can\u2019t be fucked teaching them. \n\nAnd frankly I wouldn\u2019t add that last one, because I wouldn\u2019t be going to family gatherings after that either. Expecting you to travel to them just to leave after a couple hours because otherwise your sister has a tantrum is one of the most disrespectful things I have ever heard of.

What if you arrange for 2 locations, close to each other. For example. My family went to the beach and, because of numbers, we had a pair of duplexes next to each other.  If you found a place like that,  sis and her husband could have the kids in a controlled environment, aunts and uncles could take some turns with their niblings. And the adult party could still happen.  \n\nAs long as your other sibs were willing to do some nibling wrangling AND your sister and her husband didn\u2019t try to opt out of parenting, it could be worth a shot.

Like, you physically cannot, without having a seizure, do family Christmas with a large group of young kids, and that you\u2019d like to find a solution where you can spend time with your entire family, including her, that keeps you safe?

At one point, do you get to have adult time with your family. She can put on her granny panties and deal with it.

I don\u2019t have seizures but ear defenders have been very useful for me when I\u2019m overstimulated. You might get a few questions from your Niblings but your adult relatives should understand.

Often she had to pack up a house and make travel arrangements by herself (including international flights) with no help from my dad who was usually already in the location we were being transferred.  All this is to say that responsible parenting is possible if you put in the effort.

It's not an ideal solution all the time--I got the kids some gift bags and my sister let them open everything when I was in the other room, so I sometimes miss fun things, but ear defenders have for sure helped. I've actually been able to go to some public events I would have otherwise missed because I can pair the earmuffs over my earbuds and basically cut out any extra noise.

And as a single mom of two I have to say, PARENTING IS A THING. I have a sister with three kids, and a husband, who are rambunctious, screaming, whining and crying all the time - throwing up for attention - (don't ask) and it's quite a strain when we visit family because my sister clocks out as soon as we get there, expecting our mom to take over.\n\nI always try to reassure my sis (when I'm there) and give her that break so I tell her not to worry I'll watch her kids (and mine) and lo and behold, they stop screaming, stop throwing up, say please and thank you, and learn how to express their needs. I've also had the kids over at my place and we work on these things together and even five kids in a tiny apartment has never caused a complaint from the neighbors.\n\n(When she visits the fam and I'm not there, she comes home sad because she feels \"unwanted\" but she literally dumps her kids on my aging and overwhelmed mom and expects... what? I don't know.)\n\nI've offered my sister time and time again to help her out so she has an easier time with her kids, but she's just not interested and as soon as the kids get back home it's back to the screaming and whining, because apparently that's the only way to get her attention and then she goes right back to resenting them.\n\nIt makes me so sad for the kids. So long story short - parenting is an option. And if she chooses to \"get tipsy\" and let the kids run wild, she should also be understanding of the fact that you deserve some time with your family and shouldn't always have to be closeted away because her kids trigger your disability in an awful way. \n\nMy kids would be walking on eggshells if my brother were in your shoes. You deserve time with your family too. And also YOU ARE HER FAMILY - she should care about your needs! \n\nIs it at all possible to maybe designate a single room to be a playroom where the kids can take their toys and play - maybe even with the door closed- while she visits? And the toys cannot be taken out of that room?\n\nAnd when the kids are \"feeling loud\" they can go into that room and let it out? \n\nIf not, would it be an option to get a babysitter to come in and help out on the event itself? Just having an adult be there to provide some structure (when your sister is not) might help with the noise level.\n\nIf not, I think planning a second adult get-together is lovely and fair and think your sister should be enough of an adult to understand how this situation has not been fair to you.\n\nSorry if I come off as too harsh towards your sister, I'm probably just feeling triggered by my own sister.", "NTA.

I think it is perfectly reasonable to have an adults party and a whole family party. As someone with kids who lives far away from family, I have missed out on a lot over the years - birthdays, Christmases, family get togethers, even weddings. It sucks but my family should not miss out on having fun because of my life choices (both where I live and having kids). So have your two parties. The only caveat is she should be invited to both, with it made very clear it is adults only at the party on X date. I would actually make a plan ready before issuing invites on what to do with the kids; eg can all the cousins stay at a siblings house that lives close by, hire a babysitter (or more than one if lots of kids), pizza and a movie. It doesn't matter if everyone knows she can't make it; it is important that she knows she is welcome to come if she can. If she can't make it, it is disappointing for her but that is life. If she can, it is all good.", "Not at all unreasonable. And I would sell it as: for x years I have been excluded due to noise, I think it\u2019s fair to do double parties at slight exclusion on their part for the next x years and then we alternate. NTA \nAlso story time: I work in a place that lets kids in begrudgingly. Today I had 5 different 3-6 year old kids come in with their parents. Ironically one after the other. All sat at the same exact table. \nFirst kid about 4 happily kept adding water to his orange juice claiming he made infinite orange juice, ate his food then coloured. They stayed for an hour and it was completely silent. \nSecond kid was about 2. Ate it\u2019s food making a mess on the table, which the parents cleaned up!. Left all good.\nFinal kid was 4. Came in immediately started screeching and just would not stop. 2 solid hours of endless noise. People moved away from them. At the end the table was destroyed. Floor covered in finger paint, table covered. Glitter. (Who brings glitter and finger paint to a restaurant?!?) and play dough. Not saying your system isn\u2019t parenting but I am heavily implying it", "You're being very reasonable about this, and your sister is not. If you can get the rest of the family on board (and it sounds like they mostly already are), you should have a frank discussion amongst yourselves about the need for adults-only time, and, perhaps more importantly, how to effectively convey to your sister that sometimes things will happen that she cannot attend. \n\nIt seems like that's the crux of the issue, really - your sister opposes anything she can't be a part of. That's unfair not just to you, but to literally everyone else! Imagine if you had that sort of attitude about the party - what if you got mad about them continuing the party after you leave? What if you started resenting them and causing trouble whenever you had to leave? I would bring this up because your family isn't really seeing you and your sister as equally impacted by this, that's partly because you're simply not the one kicking up a fuss. If they say they're reluctant to do something without her, well, why aren't they reluctant to do things without you? Why will they accommodate the kids, but not your disability?\n\nAnd yes, I would deliberately start using the term \"disability\" to describe your medical condition, because that's what it is. As someone with invisible disabilities, believe me, I get that using that term can be difficult for a range of reasons; however, I think you really need to use it to get across the severity of your problem, *and* to give your family the strength to stand up to your sister.\n\nBecause she does not take your very serious medical condition seriously at all, your sister is probably framing this situation as \"my kids vs OP's preferences,\" which really does sound bad. Reframe it as \"my sister is refusing to accommodate or even acknowledge my disability, but I have as much right to family time as she does.\" Your sister is trying to downplay a serious medical issue, and should she continue to disregard your needs I think you would not be off base to call her behavior ableist. \n\nYour sister needs to accept that sometimes having kids means you can't attend all the events you want to, because it is absolutely acceptable and reasonable for children to be excluded from certain events.  \n\nAnd the rest of your family needs to stop letting your sister dictate what you can and cannot do. (Actually *that's* probably the crux of the problem right there.) And I think that they will do so much more readily when you frame this medical issue as the disability it is - that immediately turns it into a *need* rather than a preference, and even if they were already well aware of all that, it will really strengthen both their argument and their spine if your sister puts up a fuss.\n\nGood luck. I think this is absolutely doable, especially since it sounds like everyone else wants it to happen too!", "5 kids under 5... Oh my. I fully understand her needing a break.\n\nIs it possible to have the adult part after the kid's bedtime? I mean at that age they were all asleep at 7 here anyway. What's their bedtime? I assume they're staying over since they travel so far? \n\nThat way there's an all family party during the day when the kids are still happy and have energy and then the adults can party at night.\n\nBut I do feel like your sister should take a break from having kids until she can handle the ones she has right now.\nWhere's their dad in all this anyway? Why isn't he helping? Why are they leaving it up to your parents to keep them from destroying the house?", "If you want a party like that, then you need to organize it. Then invite whoever you want.

His sister doesn't accept that he has a disability, and she's doing all of NOTHING to accommodate OP, even bringing along noisy toys. \n\nThere's absolutely no reason there shouldn't be an adults only party *in addition* to the regular one. If sis finds a sitter, great - but having kids does come with making sacrifices, and she HAS to realize - and accept!! - that sometimes things will happen without her.", "there\u2019s not a way to consider the medical issues wth 5 young kids. they are being kids. they are allowed to have toys or listen to music and it\u2019s unrealistic to expect them to just sit around quietly. it\u2019s unfortunate op has this condition but it\u2019s also\nnot his sisters responsibility to manage, she\u2019s not doing anything wrong", "Do it in front of her kids IMO.

I can't handle it for too long without having to bail, and asking for things to be quieter is usually met with \"ha, try LIVING with this!\" Not very productive.\n\n>Being a mom of five I COMPLETELY get needing a break and just wanting to relax and enjoy time with your siblings, but she just kind of sets them down and ignores them until someone needs a diaper change. Her husband isn't much better, he mostly plays on his phone.\n\nPersonally I'd argue \"parenting your child\" involves more than just sitting your kids in front of a TV and ignoring them / letting everyone else deal with them while you're getting on the lash. In fact I'd argue actually paying attention to them is the bare minimum I'd expect of a parent."]}
