{"id": 17172, "submission_id": "13gz7r0", "title": "AITA for wanting a separate Christmas without my sister's kids?", "selftext": "I M28 have several siblings all about my age. Only my youngest sister F25 has kids, of which she has 5. I have nothing wrong with my sister wanting to be a mom and I love my nieces and nephews, but I can't be around them much. \n\nI have a medical condition that can cause seizures when I'm overstimulated, and generally messes me up if I can't leave to decompress. When we visit our parents for the holidays, I'll hang out with my other siblings and their spouses, then when my sister shows up with her husband I'll greet them, visit for a minute, then put in my headphones and go somewhere else when noise picks up. If it was a normal level of chaos it might even be okay (I'm pretty fine with the adults laughing and talking), but she'll bring loud toys, turn on CocoMelon, and let the kids run wild. I can't handle it for too long without having to bail, and asking for things to be quieter is usually met with \"ha, try LIVING with this!\" Not very productive.\n\nIt sucks getting to visit with my family for maybe two hours and then basically having to leave the party. I've tried catching up with people away from the group, but my sister takes it personally and keeps asking why I don't want to talk to her and her husband. She knows about the seizures, I just think something isn't clicking in her brain even though I keep explaining why I can't stick around.\n\nLast year we had bad weather, and my sister couldn't drive from out of state to come to the Christmas party. Most of us were already at our parents' place when she texted, so we just had the party anyway and planned a follow-up for them in a couple weeks. It ended up being a blast! I actually got to stay for the whole thing! I didn't mind a bit that I had to hang out in the kitchen for most of the second party--I got the fun out of my system and was just happy to see my sister and meet her new baby.\n\nWhen my sister found out that we basically did Christmas without her, she was understandably upset. She and her kids still had presents to open and we had a nice lunch, but there wasn't the same adult party she'd hoped she could join. Granted, her \"joining the adults\" was her unleashing her kids and getting tipsy while our parents struggled to keep them from destroying their house, but I get it. Getting left out sucks.\n\nThat being said, I loved having two parties, and I asked my dad about doing this every year. While he also enjoyed the adults party, we both agreed that splitting up Christmas would really upset my sister. Living out of state with that many kids, it's basically impossible for her to do both parties. We tried to think of other options, but most of us spend New Year with our spouses, and my sister would be furious if she found out we didn't invite her to a non-holiday family party. I just don't think it's fair that I practically have to skip Christmas half the time because she has so many rowdy kids.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for wanting a separate party? Is there another solution I'm not seeing?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the wonderful feedback and ideas. I'm especially happy to hear of people with family members that have a similar condition, and the kids have learned that \"loud noises will make uncle X sick\". It makes me really hopeful that this will go away with time.\n\nI wanted to provide some answers to questions I'm seeing in the comments here for further context:\n- My parents have been the only immediate family members in-state with a house, so it has been the default destination for gatherings for a while. My older sister did recently purchase a house so that might be on the table as an option--she might be open to hosting an adults-only party there\n- I live with one of my brothers in a small apartment, so our place isn't an option\n- I do not think my sister is a bad parent, just not a terribly involved one. There are lots of small kids in my extended family that I don't have nearly as much of a problem around. It is mostly the combination of a small house and lots of loud unmitigated noise. That being said she has abruptly handed me a baby on several occasions and just said \"thanks!\" and run away. Super convinced she does not understand the risks of doing that.\n- I developed my condition in adulthood after we all lived separately. My sister has never actually seen me have a seizure, but we all gossip like hens so news like \"OP is in the hospital again\" likely makes its way to her in real time\n- I do not want my sister to not be able to come to Christmas. Hell, I think her kids have an explicit right to participate and I love seeing them. I spent hours scrolling facebook last year trying to see what cartoon characters and things they liked while I was shopping to make them gift bags. I LOVE my nieces and nephews.\n- I don't drive home when I am experiencing an aura/seizure, I will usually go lay in my parents' spare bedroom and wait it out. Sometimes this means I sleep there until night time when I'm safe to leave, or the brother I live with will drive me home and I'll pick up my car another day\n- It's not specifically kids I have an issue with--if I can't bring earbuds to the supermarket I literally won't go shopping. It takes a massive toll on my body being in any situation that's loud and bright and way too active, even if it doesn't cause a seizure\n- The festival with live music was an art festival that had a stage where local bands were playing. I did not hear any of it because I was there to look at sculptures and buy homemade cotton candy", "created_utc": 1684028978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gz7r0/aita_for_wanting_a_separate_christmas_without_my/", "score": 3685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her behavior towards you is staggeringly not okay. You deserve to get a Christmas with your family as much as she does, and you're the one whose existence isn't annoying for everyone else. \n\nLots of people do one full family and one adults only event, especially when there aren't many kids in the family. It would be totally okay to say \"cocktails for the adults on Saturday and family dinner on Sunday,\" and if they can't come, they can't come. Them's the breaks when you choose to have kids. \n\nLying to her or excluding them fully is asinine. Just make a kid-free rule, and if she throws a fit tell her to suck it up. I feel like you're making this out to be much more dramatic than it actually is. \n\nAlso, your parents should be the ones to tell her that she needs to get her kids under control, and that her treatment of you/willful refusal to take your disability seriously is unacceptable. Just because she's an adult doesn't mean they have to let her act like an ass.", "NTA, having two parties is perfectly fine. One where the family can do family christmas and one where adults can have a relaxing party. if it is okay for you to be excluded, it is fine for the sister to be excluded. just plan it around sometime before or after you sister is there.", "Clarification: My suggestion was not for my sister to skip Christmas and just do a makeup party later, which was sort of the case this last year. I wanted to see if it was possible to do an adults-only party separate from the regular celebration with the kids and everyone. I just know my sister couldn't make both and would be upset if we had a family party she couldn't come to. It doesn't even need to be Christmas, but my siblings live all over and I'd like to get a chance to see them and visit, maybe a few weeks before or after actual Christmas, without it upsetting my sister. I love her, I want to include her and her kids, but I also want to be able to enjoy the holidays without it risking my health.

Unfortunately, constantly leaving out a sibling can cause a major rift. You have a medical condition that hinders your enjoyment of situations where you are more likely to be overstimulated. I imagine it would peak where there are several children causing a raucous or even at a theme park or concert where sound and lights and activity are all at a 10. \n\nWhile you take care of yourself to not need medical attention, your sister on the other hand refuses to parent. 5 kids is a lot, and it\u2019s not as if she doesn\u2019t have time to get a sitter and drink on her own time over the rest of the year. Not only does she not parent the children, but you did not mention a spouse in this situation. Can the other parent not take over? Who is teaching them how to follow rules, act in public, be good humans? \n\nESH. There has to be some parenting done, and your sister needs to be in that conversation as well.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nThis might be a dreadful suggestion, but has your sister ever actually witnessed a seizure? It might be worth engineering one when she's around so she can see just how awful they are.  I have similar health issues (meltdowns, also a really dodgy gut) and my brother and his wife honestly didn't realise just how bad they were until they saw both first hand. It made them a lot more accommodating.\n\nHowever I realise it's an extreme suggestion and you may need to enroll the rest of your family to support you.", "NTA for enjoying the peace you had. YTA for actually wanting to exclude your sister. The condition is yours, therefore you're the one who needs to make accommodations for yourself.

It\u2019s also not fair that she be excluded.", "Unfortunately YTA. You can't exclude them. They're family. Why not try showing up early? Say the party is from 5pm onward, can you ask to come at 3 or 4 to get some extra time in with at least your parents? Or make the party extend later so when your sister and her kids need to leave for bedtime, you can stay and catch up with whoever else? Is there not an area of the house you can set up as a play room with super fun stuff or a tent or something to encourage the kids to be a bit farther from your earshot? Surely there's a workaround here that doesn't exclude anyone.", "So ...because you have an issue and you don't think it's fair that YOUR issue causes you to miss out on family time your solution is to exclude your sister? \n\nHAHAHHAHAHAHHA\n\n\nYTA", "Info please. You have seizures from being around active children?", "A big fat AH. Yep that\u2019s you. Excluding your family at a family event. Perhaps they should just exclude you instead. You can have your peace and quiet all alone.", ">Granted, her \"joining the adults\" was her unleashing her kids and getting tipsy while our parents struggled to keep them from destroying their house, but I get it.

You\u2019re laughing at someone who has fucking seizures when they are overstimulated, making it difficult and potentially dangerous for them to be around that many small children all day. You\u2019re laughing at someone for their medical condition and reducing it down to \u201cYOUR issue\u201d, as if OP has decided they have an irrational fear of peas and refuses to attend until peas are off the menu for everyone. \n\nAnd don\u2019t tell me seizures aren\u2019t dangerous - they can be fucking fatal, I\u2019ve lost a friend to a head injury sustained as a direct result of a seizure. \n\nOP and their sister have different access needs but both should feel able to spend time feeling comfortable and with their family. An adults only event every once in a while sounds completely reasonable. OP isn\u2019t asking for every event, or Christmas Day itself. Just ONCE IN A WHILE that events happen without kids so they can fully participate.\n\nAnd the sister isn\u2019t even excluded from that event, that\u2019s the really awesome part of what OP has suggested. Because, while OP does not have a way to just decide to turn off their seizures, the sister DOES have a way to take a day or evening off from taking care of her kids to join in the adult only party. She could hire a babysitter, ask the children\u2019s father to care for them while she attends the event, she could ask the paternal grandparents or aunts/uncles to babysit. It might not be convenient, but the sister DOES have options to change her situation. OP does not have that luxury. So if it\u2019s important enough to her to attend the adults only event, she can find a way to make it happen.

In short bursts it would be completely fine, but I get fatigued over the day and am more susceptible to it if it goes on for a long time. I completely understand that this isn't my sister's fault--I do what I can do work around it and still visit with everyone, but if I have a seizure I'll probably be out for the rest of the night, if not the following day too. It's not as severe as epilepsy, but it can be debilitating.", "But it's okay if OP is excluded from the event? He has to leave early to prevent a potential seizure.", "Completely agree, especially during the holidays", "OPs sister is 25. You think her kids are old enough to be \"respectful\"? She probably has a baby, a toddler, and some very young kids. A toddler doesn't understand to not destroy things yet.

If the sister wants to participate in the adult only get together, she can leave the kids with their dad, other set of grandparents, aunts or uncles, or hire a babysitter. OP can\u2019t turn their seizures off. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even a forever situation, because children grow. This only needs to be the arrangement until her kids are old enough to consistently remember to use their inside voices and play calmly instead of tearing through the house like tiny hurricanes, making enough noise to raise the dead as they go.

It really seems like she either doesn't understand my condition or thinks I'm lying about it to avoid her. My parents and other siblings see me more often, they know about the full impact it's had on my life. My mom even scolded her when she was venting about how rude I was (I had gone home by this point) because I can't help it.

And as a single mom of two I have to say, PARENTING IS A THING. I have a sister with three kids, and a husband, who are rambunctious, screaming, whining and crying all the time - throwing up for attention - (don't ask) and it's quite a strain when we visit family because my sister clocks out as soon as we get there, expecting our mom to take over.\n\nI always try to reassure my sis (when I'm there) and give her that break so I tell her not to worry I'll watch her kids (and mine) and lo and behold, they stop screaming, stop throwing up, say please and thank you, and learn how to express their needs. I've also had the kids over at my place and we work on these things together and even five kids in a tiny apartment has never caused a complaint from the neighbors.\n\n(When she visits the fam and I'm not there, she comes home sad because she feels \"unwanted\" but she literally dumps her kids on my aging and overwhelmed mom and expects... what? I don't know.)\n\nI've offered my sister time and time again to help her out so she has an easier time with her kids, but she's just not interested and as soon as the kids get back home it's back to the screaming and whining, because apparently that's the only way to get her attention and then she goes right back to resenting them.\n\nIt makes me so sad for the kids. So long story short - parenting is an option. And if she chooses to \"get tipsy\" and let the kids run wild, she should also be understanding of the fact that you deserve some time with your family and shouldn't always have to be closeted away because her kids trigger your disability in an awful way. \n\nMy kids would be walking on eggshells if my brother were in your shoes. You deserve time with your family too. And also YOU ARE HER FAMILY - she should care about your needs! \n\nIs it at all possible to maybe designate a single room to be a playroom where the kids can take their toys and play - maybe even with the door closed- while she visits? And the toys cannot be taken out of that room?\n\nAnd when the kids are \"feeling loud\" they can go into that room and let it out? \n\nIf not, would it be an option to get a babysitter to come in and help out on the event itself? Just having an adult be there to provide some structure (when your sister is not) might help with the noise level.\n\nIf not, I think planning a second adult get-together is lovely and fair and think your sister should be enough of an adult to understand how this situation has not been fair to you.\n\nSorry if I come off as too harsh towards your sister, I'm probably just feeling triggered by my own sister.", "NTA.

It sucks but my family should not miss out on having fun because of my life choices (both where I live and having kids). So have your two parties. The only caveat is she should be invited to both, even if you don'tthink she can make it. Make it clear that one party is adults only and I would actually make a plan ready before issuing invites on what to do with the kids; eg can all the cousins stay at a siblings house that lives close by, hire a babysitter (or more than one if lots of kids), pizza and a movie. It doesn't matter if everyone knows she can't make it; it is important that she knows she is welcome to come if she can. If she can't make it, it is disappointing for her but that is life.

All sat at the same exact table. \nFirst kid about 4 happily kept adding water to his orange juice claiming he made infinite orange juice, ate his food then coloured. They stayed for an hour and it was completely silent. \nSecond kid was about 2. Ate it\u2019s food making a mess on the table, which the parents cleaned up!. Left all good.\nFinal kid was 4. Came in immediately started screeching and just would not stop. 2 solid hours of endless noise. People moved away from them. At the end the table was destroyed. Floor covered in finger paint, table covered. Glitter. (Who brings glitter and finger paint to a restaurant?!?) and play dough. Not saying your system isn\u2019t parenting but I am heavily implying it", "You're being very reasonable about this, and your sister is not. If you can get the rest of the family on board (and it sounds like they mostly already are), you should have a frank discussion amongst yourselves about the need for adults-only time, and, perhaps more importantly, how to effectively convey to your sister that sometimes things will happen that she cannot attend. \n\nIt seems like that's the crux of the issue, really - your sister opposes anything she can't be a part of. That's unfair not just to you, but to literally everyone else! Imagine if you had that sort of attitude about the party - what if you got mad about them continuing the party after you leave? What if you started resenting them and causing trouble whenever you had to leave? I would bring this up because your family isn't really seeing you and your sister as equally impacted by this, that's partly because you're simply not the one kicking up a fuss. If they say they're reluctant to do something without her, well, why aren't they reluctant to do things without you? Why will they accommodate the kids, but not your disability?\n\nAnd yes, I would deliberately start using the term \"disability\" to describe your medical condition, because that's what it is. As someone with invisible disabilities, believe me, I get that using that term can be difficult for a range of reasons; however, I think you really need to use it to get across the severity of your problem, *and* to give your family the strength to stand up to your sister.\n\nBecause she does not take your very serious medical condition seriously at all, your sister is probably framing this situation as \"my kids vs OP's preferences,\" which really does sound bad. Reframe it as \"my sister is refusing to accommodate or even acknowledge my disability, but I have as much right to family time as she does.\" Your sister is trying to downplay a serious medical issue, and should she continue to disregard your needs I think you would not be off base to call her behavior ableist. \n\nYour sister needs to accept that sometimes having kids means you can't attend all the events you want to, because it is absolutely acceptable and reasonable for children to be excluded from certain events.  \n\nAnd the rest of your family needs to stop letting your sister dictate what you can and cannot do. (Actually *that's* probably the crux of the problem right there.) And I think that they will do so much more readily when you frame this medical issue as the disability it is - that immediately turns it into a *need* rather than a preference, and even if they were already well aware of all that, it will really strengthen both their argument and their spine if your sister puts up a fuss.\n\nGood luck. I think this is absolutely doable, especially since it sounds like everyone else wants it to happen too!", "5 kids under 5... Oh my. I fully understand her needing a break.\n\nIs it possible to have the adult part after the kid's bedtime? I mean at that age they were all asleep at 7 here anyway. What's their bedtime? I assume they're staying over since they travel so far? \n\nThat way there's an all family party during the day when the kids are still happy and have energy and then the adults can party at night.\n\nBut I do feel like your sister should take a break from having kids until she can handle the ones she has right now.\nWhere's their dad in all this anyway?

Maybe a separate room with a quiet film, sleeping bags etc.", "I am a mum to a disabled 4 year old.  She stood at 3, first word at 2, currently learning age 2 with a genetic condition which means she needs at least 10x, up to 100x or will never learn something.  We have been potty training continuously bar one week break for emergency throat surgery since October and currently have a 10% success rate because she wanted to be like the other kids in her class.  She comes with a LOT of medical kit and really is difficult to control with a 2 year old mind in a 4 year old body.\n\nBut she has physical and age appropriate chores we help her complete like getting daddy the milk from the fridge for his coffee (she is 100% non oral),, pressing the button on her nebuliser or making sure her tummy feed port is closed.  She has to take care of her toys which are taken away if she rough houses them and pause her tablet when she wants to do something else.  She understands when we ask her to use her indoor voice and to wait whilst someone is speaking.  She understands someone might say no and that is okay, people are allowed to say no to her.  She understands some behaviours are ok to some people and places but not to others, eg I have never damage in my arm and can't lift her like her dad or grandparents.  It has been hard and a constant battle but we valued it enough to keep going and get there because this is the foundation of learning to keep ourselves safe when we get older and be considerate and aware of others needs.  If your sister doesn't have this and isn't parenting it from an early age things are going to be difficult at any gathering where they are expected to behave in a responsible manner.\n\nWe also realise we cannot do what we used to pre child (adult decision to have a child leads to adult consequences of not being able to do certain things anymore and also being completely responsible whenever they need it to another human being.  Who knew?!?).  Not mentioning we have a child in general who would be detrimental to certain gatherings, we have to consider her needs and kit.  We have to consider the ethos of the gathering.  We have to consider the impact of bringing a child who is a flashing neon sign for medicine, who feeds with a port to stomach by syringe, who occasionally travels with an oxygen cylinder, who should never have made it but even the drs don't know how other than her own grim determination, to a group who may have their own squeamishness, grief and PTSD to cope with.  But we also don't hide away because she has a right to be here.  She was the only great grandchild at a recent funeral where all the other families with pre school kids \"stayed away because young children are not appropriate at a funeral\".  She was belle of the ball and everyone loved telling her stories about the deceased.  Daddy and I did almost no child care that day as aunts, uncles and others vied for her attention and a hug, even if they had to do a medical feed or keep a nasal cannula correct.\n\nAll this is to say NTA. I struggle to find a way around this but also that I am very angry on your behalf that your sister AND YOUR WIDER FAMILY does not fully acknowledge the significant impact of your situation AND the amount of effort you already go to to keep in contact.  \n\nPOINT 1.  I would not condone making your niece's and nephews aware of your illness yourself. This is the job of your sister.  Please let her know that you would like her to tell them about it in an age appropriate way.  Provide her some links, possibly a video.  This may have the added effect of educating her more too.  Make it a requirement that she has done it to a level you are happy with before they next see you.  This is now a requirement before the next Xmas gathering.  It is entirely socially acceptable and responsible for young children to understand some people are sick who won't get better, they may or may not get worse.  The sickness may not be obvious to look at but that doesn't make it less.  That some people have no control over these sicknesses, hidden or not, and normal things can make them react abnormally.  It is a great learning start for learning about things like 999 or asking a grown up for help.  They need this for context going forward.  In context, some days my daughter runs around the place like any normal 4 year old with her feed port at skin level on her tummy.  You would never think she has almost no throat or airway, has multiple heart and lung issues and has had 15 category 1 999 incidents in the last 3 months.\n\nPOINT 2.  I can only suggest that either a one year on, one year off Xmas rotation might give you and your sister equal footing (you deserve at least this) or some way of saying the children can run amok in this room but in all other rooms of the house they need to be appropriate.  Get the home owners and sister on board.  If they fail this then decide appropriate punishment which may be two years in a row without sister and kids and kids understand no chocolate in car on way home or whatever.  You will also need a designated crash/decompress room in this instance and have completely nuclear repercussions if not kept safe.\n\nYou have a right to ask for your needs to be respected as much as every one else on this planet.

Is your sister the only one out of state or why is Christmas the only time you get together? Does this getting together have to be linked with a holiday? Can you not get together one on one outside of Christmas?\n\nIf it does have to be linked with Christmas, why do your parents have to host the adults only portion? Would it be possible for you to host an adults only event while everyone is visiting? And/or could you arrange for the kids to have a couple of babysitters (everyone pitches in; not just on the sister). Could even be their present - you could send the kids that are old enough somewhere like an indoor play place.

I didn\u2019t see any mention of ages but they can\u2019t be terribly old. As a parent of four, I probably have more empathy for the sister\u2019s tolerance of chaos than most. I think it\u2019s even possible that the kids are not actually particularly wild - it\u2019s just that there\u2019s a lot of them. Their routine is all messed up because of travelling and you know, Christmas. The sister and husband may feel that they are doing the best they can, and from their perspective OP is uncomfortable with kids and not making an effort to be an uncle. Since the medical condition developed as an adult, I doubt the family \u201cgets\u201d it. Have they actually witnessed a seizure? When my sibling developed severe allergies as an adult my parents didn\u2019t get it at all even though we explained what it was like. When they actually witnessed an anaphylactic reaction they had a lot more understanding of the situation.

Op has a medical condition they can't control, sister presumably knew this when she made the choice to have 5 kids. If I had to choose between sparing the feelings of the family member who continued to have children knowing being around them would trigger their sibling to have seizures and the person asking if they can have some time to hang out with their family without suffering from seizures, I would choose the latter. Sister can still come celebrate, but unfortunately her choices mean she can't attend the adult celebration.

Maybe shift your big family celebration to a summer holiday instead of Xmas so that the kids can run around and scream outside.  I don't know how big your parents house is, but someone needs to step up and designate a kids room.  At Xmas, buy a plastic swimming pool and fill it with ball pit balls.  Trust me , that will keep all 5 kids busy with less noise than Cocomelon.  Get a bubble machine.  Put on Christmas movies instead of Cocomelon.  As the kids get older, playdough, crafts, chewing gum, etc.  For now, put up a baby gate in the room where they will be.  They should not have free reign in the house. If the kids are going to be a meaningful part of the celebration, the hosting family needs to step up and do something proactive ahead of time to make the day special popand engaging for the kids instead of waiting for your sister to step up because she either won't or possible CAN'T.
