My family is CofE and religious festivals are very important to us. None of us are the type to force our beliefs on anyone else - other people have different beliefs, and it is incredibly rude and pointless to disregard that.\n\nHowever, my sister (32F) is an atheist and doesn\u2019t want religion to be a part of her or her children\u2019s lives. We sometimes bicker about this as she doesn\u2019t want me to practice my religion in front of her (for example, at meals with her I will still say grace but she gets annoyed at me doing that in front of her kids, despite the fact that I never ask them to do it with me). \n\nAnyway, Christmas is a very important event for my family, and my husband and I always host it as we have the biggest house and so can accommodate all the guests (my family always stays over for the week surrounding because I don\u2019t live near any of them). My sister was previously always invited, and she\u2019d come with her kids in the afternoon (after we\u2019d all been to church) for the present giving and receiving and then she\u2019d stay for Christmas dinner.\n\nHowever, she always has a problem with everyone saying grace or singing carols together. She says she feels forced to participate and that we\u2019re influencing her children despite her making it clear that she doesn\u2019t want religion around them. Last year, when she put up a fuss about it, it was more intense than usual and she said that we\u2019re all idiots for believing in this \u2018rubbish\u2019 and that there is no God and that Christianity ruined Christmas (while I know that a lot of the traditions are pagan, what Christmas celebrates is directly tied to Christianity so I\u2019m not sure what she was on about then). I told her not to go to a religious event if she\u2019s so against religion and to stay home and practise whatever secular traditions she wants. \n\nShe said she goes to Christmas every year because she wants to see the family, but more that she doesn\u2019t know how to refuse the invite. So I said that next (this) year she won\u2019t be getting an invite so there shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I stuck to my word and she isn\u2019t invited this year. She called me an asshole for \u2018blocking her out\u2019 from the family. Everyone is perfectly respectful of her beliefs, but she isn\u2019t of ours so I don\u2019t want her there at all time which is important to our beliefs.

You say you don't understand what your sister meant about \"Christianity ruining Christmas,\" which admittedly does sound ridiculous if you don't know the context.\n\nChristians celebrate Christmas as the birth of Christ. However, there is textual evidence in the Bible to suggest that Jesus was not born in winter, but during a different season. Historically, Christmas was celebrated in late December to coincide with the Winter Solstace and a lot of corresponding \"pagan\" festivals (Yule, etc). A lot of Christian holidays were established through this type of conversion, because it's easier to give a preexisting holiday a new, Christian meaning than to forbid people from celebrating it altogether. That's also why Easter is so close to the Spring Equinox when there's evidence that Jesus's crucifixion took place later in the year. \n\nIf you're interested in this subject, Overly Sarcastic Productions has a good video essay about the history of Christmas on YouTube.

Did you all grow up in this environment where your religion was a heavy presence over your lifestyle?\n\nAlso, I see in OPs post history they say they were often shouted at as a child and it scared them, they try not to raise their voices with their own children. Which also makes me question their childhood and whether or not their younger sibling experienced some form of abuse or trauma. \n\nMy gut is telling me it's a strong possibility she has a reason to be this reactive, that her wishes aren't respected when OP visits her, and there could be some religious trauma going on.

Can schedules be adjusted so that presents are opened after dinner with grace and before dessert (that's already been prayed over)? Can all of the more religious elements of the celebration be scheduled at a time when your sister and her family aren't there? Why not create a new tradition and have a secular Christmas eve with funny movie that everyone, including your sister and her family can enjoy?

It's awkward for them, but it doesn't cost them anything and they want me to feel accepted. That's love. For my part, I try to keep it simple.

On ordinary days I usually say a simple silent grace, and my husband joins me. In my family, our focus is each other. Not what we believe and don't believe. No one there is keeping score. \n\nThis stands out to me: \n\n>I told her not to go to a religious event if she\u2019s so against religion and to stay home and practise whatever secular traditions she wants.\n\nI think she wants to spend time with family and for her its not a \"religious event.\" For you, it is. \n\nBased on the way you've presented this situation, your atheist sister isn't willing to conform to the family religious ideology and thus has gotten herself ostracized from the family holiday celebration. That's the true spirit of Christmas after all, being technically right, keeping to the letter of the law and forgetting the spirit. It sounds like your sister has made previous celebrations unpleasant for everyone by being so vocal about elements of the celebration that the rest of you take for granted. I'm definitely going against the herd here, but YTA. When I first read this I was inclined to agree with you, actually. But upon reflection, you've had a year to pray on this, to sit with it in your heart and to reach out to your sister. But nope -- you're sticking with what you said last year in the heat of the moment based on what she said in the heat of the moment. You want to be \"right\" rather than show your sister love. Even if this boundary was necessary, and it very well may be if your sister isn't willing to meet you halfway, you could have gone about this in a more charitable way. This is why so many people hate the holidays. True belief is only in the trapping of faith and not where the rubber meets the road. Your sister is also in the wrong because it's as much her responsibility to meet in the middle as it is yours. But there is a certain irony that religious celebration is being utilized as a weapon of exclusion, and that it's more important to sing a carol than welcome your sister and her family.

In general, it's a great parenting opportunity to be able to explain to your kids the beliefs of others, and why we do or do not subscribe to them. Insulating your child from any experience or belief you think is 'bad' isn't effective, it isn't healthy, it's stressful, it's damaging to relationships (e.g. this whole post), and it doesn't teach your kids a damn thing.\n\nI'm not religious, but my parents are. They say grace at special meals (like Christmas, Easter, etc) and when my daughter is old enough, if she asks, we will talk about religious beliefs, and that some people follow religions and others don't. Then she gets to learn and choose and explore - with maybe a bit of guidance on my part - so she's exposed to other things and isn't just told they're bad with no explanation. You know, so she gets to exercise her mind. \n\nIn a more culturally useful sense, like it or not, religion is a huge factor in many people's lives, politics, and culture, and to be a well rounded citizen you should know some of the basics of what makes other people believe the things they do, act the way they do. Religion has shaped (afaik) every culture on the planet in ways big and small, and to hide your children away from it is doing them a disservice. Indoctrinating them with religion is obviously not the right call either, but as a parent the world is full of teachable moments, and opportunities to encourage your child to learn more, and know more. Why would anyone want to prevent their children from that?

Certain allergens are banned permanently so one friend can visit without fear of grabbing something to snack on and having a reaction. It\u2019s not a common ingredient so it\u2019s easy enough to find alternatives and make sure we have safe snacks. \n\nSo I spend an extra ten minutes shopping and reading labels. Or I keep a plastic tub of kitchen and serving items that respect someone\u2019s restrictions. Or I look up highly rated vegan and vegetarian recipes and make them. Being considerate isn\u2019t *hard.* Being kind isn\u2019t *hard.* Remembering we all *struggle* sometimes isn\u2019t hard.

Be kind for the sake of being kind. It\u2019s an easy enough way to live. Took me a good 40 years to get here but now that I\u2019m 50 I have mellowed a lot.

The way you describe your acts of care for your friends (and the acts of care they return) is beautiful. Interdependence like that is what human connection is all about at its best, I think.\n\nEdit: it also makes me think of Mia Mingus' writing/speaking on the subject of \"access as love.\" It's really beautiful.", "And now I think we're finally getting to the real core of the situation.", "I appreciate the questions and comments!\n\nTo start with, I would like to say that I am not intimately familiar with all the religious traditions, customs, and the difference between religious commandments governing behaviour, and religious customs. According to my understanding, the former wouldn't be an issue, but the latter could be. (I also want to make clear that if I had a Christian guest in my home who wanted to say grace, I certainly wouldn't object, because it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Go nuts!)\n\n>would you tell a religious Jew or Muslim to remove their hair covering in your home?\n\nNo I would not, because my understanding (caveat: I'm not a religious scholar or expert) that for Orthodox Jews it is a law that they wear their hair covering in the presence of men who aren't their husband or close family members. In the case of a Muslim hair covering (e.g. the hijab) I wouldn't ask them to do so because it is also my understanding that in some but not all Muslim countries it is a religious law to do so. I would not knowingly ask someone to violate their religious law in order to make me feel comfortable.\n\n>What about eating non-kosher/halal food or them bringing their own food?\n\nI am happy to accommodate the dietary needs and restrictions of any guests in my home to the best of my ability. If I cannot (for whatever reason), or the guest is more comfortable bringing their own food, I am entirely fine with it.\n\n>Would you demand they be forbidden to recite a blessing before eating?\n\nNo I would not, because like I said above, it doesn't bother me. But if it did bother me, I think an important difference would be if it's a religious law or a common tradition. The former I wouldn't stop, but the latter *(if it bothered me, which it does not)* I could reasonably ask them to not do in my home.\n\n>Telling people they can\u2019t observe their religion in your home is not a reasonable request.\n\nI think there's more nuance to that situation than you are implying. It is reasonable to ask people to not practice their religion in my home if they can without compromising their religious beliefs.\n\n>Telling them they cannot proselytize is a reasonable request.\n\nAgreed.\n\n>OP is not proselytizing, which would be wrong and objectionable.\n\nIf OP is only saying grace in her own home, and is not doing so in her sister's home or in the homes of others (unless she has express permission) then I have no issues with it. If she's deliberately performing religious acts in the homes of people who have asked her not to do so, then she's not necessarily proselytizing, but she's definitely trampling the requests of people in whose home she is a guest. That's not cool.\n\n>Saying grace before she eats, for herself, without bringing others into it, is perfectly reasonable\n\nYes, but there are caveats. In her own home, she's welcome to do so. In the homes of others, she should have the courtesy and respect to know when she can and cannot do that. My Christian friends who say grace normally ask at a dinner party if everyone is cool with it. I acknowledge that isn't the way everyone approaches it, but it's a half decent way to be respectful, while also making an effort to adhere to your beliefs. It is my understanding that the Christian act of saying Grace before a meal is not a religious law as are the other examples you mentioned, so she can either say it silently, or she can skip grace one time without violating religious law.\n\n>and no one should be telling her not to.\n\nAgain, there's nuance and context to that. If she's doing it where she has been told not to do it, then someone has the right to tell her not to do so and to respect their home.\n\nOnce again, just to be clear, I have no objections personally with people adhering to their religion within my home, but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask people to not perform their religious acts within your home if you have reasons why you don't want them to do so. I personally think it's a pointless fight, and I wouldn't pick it to fight, and think OP's sister is being ridiculous in this situation, but setting boundaries and rules for how people behave in your house is not (generally) unreasonable, depending on the rules - as always, context, and nuance are important.", "I did no such thing. What I wrote was \"OP here admits she says grace before meals **wherever they happen to be dining** not just at their own house.\" That's literally what I wrote.

A Christian is not going to allow me to practice my religion in their homes, the same goes for my home.", "Telling people not to practice their religion in my home is perfectly ok if they don't live there, and if their practice makes me uncomfortable. They are free to do it at their own home. \n\nSo, eating Kosher or vegetarian is fine, insisting all food is Kosher or vegetarian is not. Praying quietly is fine, loudly as a community activity is not. \n\nAnyway Op's sister cannot have issues with the way OP celebrates Christmas at their home (OP is NTA) , but is perfectly within their rights to say \"no loud grace\" in their own home. Anyway, isn't grace about saying thanks to God? Why do the other people at the table need to know that you did do it?", ">for example, at meals with her I will still say grace but she gets annoyed at me doing that in front of her kids, despite the fact that I never ask them to do it with me\n\nContains **ZERO** information about where they're eating.
