I was put back in my old room and I'm sharing it with my 6yo brother. My 3yo brother is sharing with my sister. \n\nIt's been hell. I have no privacy at all. My brothers get up at 7am, come into our room, flip the light on and start playing and fighting at full volume. I can't tell them to leave because it's \"their room.\" My mom and sister also come in at all hours of the day without knocking to put laundry or toys away, and leave the door wide open. \n\nI don't have a car and my parents only have one right now, so I haven't gotten a summer job yet. I have nowhere else to go all day so I have my airpods in most of the day to spare my sanity and drown out the constant fighting and noise, which also upsets my mother.\n\nThe 6yo is out of control as well. He bullies everyone and gets away with little to no consequences. I tell him to get out of my stuff and he hits me and runs away.

College is not just a free escape from my situation and I'm not acting \"rich\" or \"spoiled\" by taking a gap year. I literally cannot afford it.\n\nEdit 2: I'm not asking them to rearrange the rooms or force all 3 siblings in one room. I'm not sure where in my post people are reading that.

And especially a frickn toddler \nAlso, i read most of this thinking your a guy, but it makes so much more sense to stay with your sister and make it work\nAs a 19yo, getting the toilet door flung open is not something you want, EVER\nits not like your all still small children who can shower together\nAlso, your mom is definitely favorating her younger kids so i highly recommend you find a job, and soon to make sure that atleast for the rest of the year you spend a majority of your time out of this mess, and can make a bit on the side to pay for college and get out all together!", "Honestly I would take out loans and go back to college.  This is jot a livable situation and you won\u2019t be able to work and save anyway.", "NAH, it's understandable to feel cramped & not like rooming with a 6 yr old! Not sure what anyone can do about it, though.  Maybe ask your sister if she would rather share a room with you than her 3 yr old brother?  Seems like you two would respect each other's space better. Good luck, I hope you can figure something out regarding job transportation!", "YTA. Asses the situation, your family aren't wealthy enough to support so many kids in the house, you're an adult, you should be working to fix the situation rather than make it worse. \n\nGet a job\nGet a car.\nFind a permanent place to stay \n\nLots of people move out at 18, you should take responsibility and not make your siblings and families life hell by being another big kid in the house mooching of them and sitting around grumpy all day with your airpods in. \n\nSucks that your parents aren't rich and you don't have a good living situation, you can cry and complain about it or you take responsibility like an adult and help them solve the problem. Take the hint and move out.", "INFO: Where were your brothers sleeping before you left for college, and why can't you sleep there?", "Info: what does your sister think about all of this?\n\nFrom the outside it sounds like the smart choice would be for you to share with your sister. But I think it all hinges on what she thinks.", "NTA. Get a door wedge for the bathroom door at the very least.", "Why don't you and your sister share a room instead? You two are closer in age, and both girls. You most likely get along better with her than your little brother. This would prevent your brothers from having a reason to come in to your room, and your parents as well, since you can do you own laundry and so can your sister. \n\nNot wanting to get hit by your brother and wanting some privacy in the bathroom is normal. You should be able to get that. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Why not use the boys?  Ask them if they want to room together?  Tell them how great it would be.  Work them into a frenzy and then tell them to go ask Mom! Again and again.  Make rooming with you a nightmare.  Work them into a frenzy and tell them to go ask Mom if they can room together.", "Agreed this is unpaid child care. Please, get a job as a live in nanny or an au pair. At least you'll be able to earn AND have your own room. Good luck!", "well she is living their rent free and eating their food... why not expect her to help with her sibblings?", "most jobs list reliable transportation as a requirement. if OP lives in an area without public transit and the family only has one car, there will be times she is late due to weather issues if she\u2019s walking/riding a bike or other things and a lot of places don\u2019t put up with that for very long", "The only privilege on show is your own! Imagine being so warped on your perception you think everyone lives in a situation like yours. She is understanding of everything you've pointed out, she is simply tired of babysitting the entire time she's home. If you don't mind it, that's fine, but simply because you're forced to move back home shouldn't make you the defacto babysitter. Your comment is simply pathetic tbh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, you're NTA, don't listen to people like this.", "Yup.", "OP is an adult. That wouldn't be unreasonable to ask of her. And the 3 year old doesn't sound like as big of a spoiled brat.\n\nBut it does need to be communicated and accompanied by the responding privileges. Like getting to hand out some select punishments.", "Because she is not just \"helping out\". They live in her room which means she never gets to shut off/relax. I don't know how it works abroad, but in the UK if she went to work as a live in nanny/au pair, there would be some divide. She could live rent free, eat their food, have her own room AND earn extra cash. This would also help her gain independence.", "remote work would be the answer if the parents showed any interest in giving her the space for it. imagine having that brother in the same room while she\u2019s working, especially since it\u2019s summer and he won\u2019t have school for part of the day. the parents dug a prison bunker for their child and will gaslight her into raising the kids instead of helping her break out of it. they could live without their converted storage space until OP saved some money doing exactly this but they\u2019d have to pay for childcare", "It\u2019s not the only solution. The other option is you share with your sister and the boys share. That makes way more sense.", "How does not having  a car stop you from working.  Have you ever heard of public transport? Lots of people commute  to work on buses, trains or even by bicycle.", "So what? It\u2019s not her kid, why should she parent him just because her mom is lazy?", "the 6 year old is not at home all day? is he? he would be in school for how long? 6-7 hours? (just guessing I live in austria 6 year olds to have 4-8 hours school each day) so she does have a ton of \"shut off relax time\" does she? and well beggers cant be chooser can they? Her parents did not ask her do move home and do not seam  very font of her moving back.. she is just 19... and I would not do that to a child if I could help it.. but  well ...", "Nta but can't you just switch rooms and go sleep with your sister and put the 2 boys together in your current room?", "Have you ever heard of rural Kentucky? wtf", "Because she's an adult living there for free.", "If I were OP I would just do the room switch while parents arent home, and say \"\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this is whats happening now. Me and sister are sharing a room, the boys are together, and none of us want to switch back. So why should we?\"\n\nmake them explain why they want you to work for them", "Honestly you would be far better off if you spent those hours on a job that pays actual money. Someone in the comments suggested you consider live-in nanny jobs or working as au pair. You'd be getting paid and have your own room.\n\nNTA for sure. While your parents suck, you are the only one that can get yourself out of the situation. Warn your sister and be there for her, just don't expect a resolution from your parents, if they were decent parents they would have solved this already.", "Not every one  on reddit  is American.", "And you didn't  say where your were from.", "That doesn\u2019t absolve mom of parenting duties.

Is there a reason you can\u2019t share with your sister?  Your mum is being unfair to both of you (and I say that as a mum myself).\n\nIf your mum won\u2019t see reason, then one alternative might be to get a summer/gap year job working somewhere that gives you bed and board (food) - no matter what the job is, because it sounds better than what you\u2019re having to tolerate at home.", "I'm sorry that your parents don't love or give a shit about you", "She\u2019s a teenager ffs, of course they\u2019re obliged to take her in.", "Rural areas without proper public transportation exist in other countries as well", "You're right, I didn't say where I was from, which is why you shouldn't have made the arrogant assumption that I had access to public transport.", "OP gets to stay there for free. Probably including food.\nIf parenting the siblings is the compensation demanded that's the compensation demanded. OP is an adult. If she doesn't like that she could always get a job and move out.\n\n But again that does need to be communicated first.", "With that attitude, you're never going to get a job. Which to me says you're too lazy and want it all handed to you on a silver plate it's not going to happen. Put on your big girl pants and figure out how to get transport and get a job.
