My sister (14F) has her own room. \n\nI came back from college for the summer and I'm probably going to be taking a gap year as well. I was put back in my old room and I'm sharing it with my 6yo brother. My 3yo brother is sharing with my sister. \n\nIt's been hell. I have no privacy at all. My brothers get up at 7am, come into our room, flip the light on and start playing and fighting at full volume. I can't tell them to leave because it's \"their room.\" My mom and sister also come in at all hours of the day without knocking to put laundry or toys away, and leave the door wide open. \n\nI don't have a car and my parents only have one right now, so I haven't gotten a summer job yet. I have nowhere else to go all day so I have my airpods in most of the day to spare my sanity and drown out the constant fighting and noise, which also upsets my mother.\n\nThe 6yo is out of control as well. He bullies everyone and gets away with little to no consequences. I tell him to get out of my stuff and he hits me and runs away. He picks the bathroom lock and bursts in laughing. \n\nWhenever I speak up about these things I get told that I'm insulting my mom's parenting, that I'm ungrateful for having a place to stay, and that I can't make any \"demands\" because I don't pay rent. I have been kicked out for a night before. My mother insists that I must hate my brother, and reads into almost everything I do or say as a direct attack against him. She says that I want to paint him as a \"little villain\" and myself as a victim. So AITA for not wanting to share a room with him?\n\nEdit: I'm taking a gap year because I was paying for college by myself and can't afford it anymore. College is not just a free escape from my situation and I'm not acting \"rich\" or \"spoiled\" by taking a gap year. I literally cannot afford it.\n\nEdit 2: I'm not asking them to rearrange the rooms or force all 3 siblings in one room. I'm not sure where in my post people are reading that.

Why is getting up at 7am such a big deal? You aren't working,  literally doing nothing from what I can tell at this point. You want a gap year, ok fine, if you are working early and that's the reason this is disturbing you then say so. If you dropped out of college and are just partying and living with your parents I have a bit less sympathy for your \"struggles\"", ">I\u2019m not acting \u201crich\u201d or \u201cspoiled\u201d by taking a gap year\n\nYeah, you are, because you expect your parents to let you come home and rearrange their house to suit you while you take your \u201cgap year\u201d.\n\nWhen you leave for college, you leave.  Your room is no longer your room.  It is a room in your parents\u2019 house, and they get to do what they want with their house.  They arranged their home for the people still living in it.  They are not AHs for that.\n\nYTA.  Get a job.  Get your own place if you don\u2019t want to share a room.", "Why didn\u2019t you write the real reason you want your own room and why your parents are making you share\u2014you pr addiction to masturbation?", "Op said their room was given to the 2 boys before, so I'm assuming that they were together and that when op came back, they got separated to 1 boy and 1 girl per room", "The parents chose to split the boys when the older daughter returned, even though the sister already had a room to herself.\n\nI definately agree with other commenters that the parents see it as an opportunity for free child care, that\u2019s horrible!", "As someone who grew up with little siblings, this is a good idea. Convince the boys sharing is more fun. NTA", "Both sisters are sharing with a younger brother, a deliberate decision it seems to saddle teenagers with toddler and childcare responsibilities and remove privacy.", "Sorry but telling your kid \"you must deal with this unreasonable and easily fixable situation or leave\" is such a gross take.", "They have a third bedroom they are using as a closet, they just seem to want their daughters to take childcare responsibilities and tbh it sounds like they don\u2019t want the older daughter back as made no effort to accommodate her.", "It\u2019s mainly the respect. Even as a kid I knew to be quiet if people are sleeping.", "LOL, choosing to take a gap year.

Her complaining about him hitting her is an AH move? Her complaining about anybody just barging in an AH move? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>what would you have them do??\n\nYou know, maybe the mother and sister not just entering and knocking? Maybe teaching the kid right and wrong? Maybe teaching the kid not to pick a lock and enter a bathroom when occupied? Maybe teaching him not to hit others?", "OP wrote that the younger sister previously shared with her younger brother (6), so has only had her own room for a year.\n\nI am sure younger sister would prefer to share with older sister than a young and noisy/disruptive/bad mannered boy (the 6 yr old) or her toddler brother (the 3 yr old).", "Or they could put the two older kids in one room and the two younger in the other??? What did I just read?", ">I'm sure it's hard on them to have the house more crowded with you there, so it's hardly like you're the only one suffering.\n\nYou are talking as if OP never lived there before. As if she wasn't living there for 18 years. You are talking as if she is some new member of the family who just came to live with them and not someone who was in college for 1 year but had been living there for 18  years before that.   \n\n\nAnd why do so many people here think that as soon as someone turns 18, they should be out of their parent's house or pay rent to live there? Like as soon as you become an adult you become a guest and not a family member. I find it so odd and weird, but maybe that's just because I have a different cultural background.", "I'm happy for you that you were privileged enough to leave and not have to move back in with your parents.", "Bicycling and public transport may not be feasible options. I live in a small town that has no public transportation and is *not* bike friendly at all. There aren't many sidewalks and the road often doesn't have a shoulder to bike on, so I'd have to be in the middle of traffic. It just wouldn't be safe. Not to mention the line of angry cars behind me on a two-lane highway because I can't pedal 55 mph....\n\nMost towns are like this in my state, too. So it's not an uncommon occurrence.", "I can't tell if you're joking or if you genuinely have screws loose.

While you and your sister share.", "Time to wait until just you and sis are alone at home, and rearrange the rooms - you and her share, and the boys share.\nParents should have zero problem with it - you know, if they aren\u2019t using you and your sister as unpaid babysitting (hint they totally are - why else have such an odd room arrangement?)\n\nAnd with the lock picking - time to jump scare your brother so he learns a lesson.  Preferably your parents would take control and institute some discipline, but since they refuse to, it might be vigilante justice time\u2026", "Right? It\u2019s so bizarre to me, I\u2019m in my 30s with a mortgage, but if something awful happened and I found myself with nowhere to live, I know for a fact I could rely on my mother to help me. She still calls my old bedroom at her house \u201cparsley\u2019s room\u201d, and will apologetically explain when someone else uses it, even though I\u2019ve said several times that there\u2019s no need for her to do that.", "Not the person you responded to, but I worked two jobs on top of going to school to not ever live with my parents again. Super abusive situation that I was never going back to. \n\nSo some of us aren\u2019t privileged, we just didn\u2019t sleep and took a little extra time to get the degree so we could work our faces off to not be back in the situation we had escaped. Hell one year I lived in a three bedroom house with 8 other people to just not live at home with my parents. \n\nI\u2019m not making a judgment on your post, I\u2019m not sure what to think about it.

Why do the parents need a walk in closet. At this point they are just being selfish.

It couldn't possibly be that they chose to be parents, and it must be impossible that I help out in as many ways as I can, including buying and making food for the family half the week, cleaning, and providing free babysitting for hours a day.
