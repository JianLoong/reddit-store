I was put back in my old room and I'm sharing it with my 6yo brother. My 3yo brother is sharing with my sister. \n\nIt's been hell. I have no privacy at all. My brothers get up at 7am, come into our room, flip the light on and start playing and fighting at full volume. I can't tell them to leave because it's \"their room.\" My mom and sister also come in at all hours of the day without knocking to put laundry or toys away, and leave the door wide open. \n\nI don't have a car and my parents only have one right now, so I haven't gotten a summer job yet. I have nowhere else to go all day so I have my airpods in most of the day to spare my sanity and drown out the constant fighting and noise, which also upsets my mother.\n\nThe 6yo is out of control as well. He bullies everyone and gets away with little to no consequences. I tell him to get out of my stuff and he hits me and runs away.

College is not just a free escape from my situation and I'm not acting \"rich\" or \"spoiled\" by taking a gap year. I literally cannot afford it.\n\nEdit 2: I'm not asking them to rearrange the rooms or force all 3 siblings in one room. I'm not sure where in my post people are reading that.

Everyone who said your parents are pawning off parenting on you and your sister are correct, but that's perfectly acceptable for them to do to you as a grown adult who is trying to board for free and is then bitching about the conditions of her free accommodations. Your sister is a child who shouldn't be made to help in this manner so it's unfair to her, but what you truly seem to not understand is this isn't your room at all. It is your parents room your age staying in for free and now that you've left you feel entitled to privacy, your own space, and respect of your possessions and are trying to victimize yourself for your parents saying no. \n\nTo highlight that point, let's go other your other free rooming accomodations you can pursue: you can go live on the street, there you won't have to share a room with your brother or worry about him going through your stuff or being loud at 7 am (I get up at 430 am 7 days a week to help provide access to care for the homeless, so let me tell you this option will really really teach you just how bratty and entitled you are), your next option is go stay in a homeless shelter which would really help to teach you what is like to actually have somebody violate your personal space and your possessions, or you can go find a sugar daddy and learn what it's like to actually have your bodily autonomy violated for a place to live. I would implore you to take a minute and think about what you are receiving, and what you are complaining about again, except this time do it outside of your lens if entitlement. \n\nI'd also advise you not to listen to the rest of the people saying NTA. They are so immediately displaying their sense of entitlement and lack of understanding of how the world actually works. Your parents are not a safety net or a bank account for you, they are two individuals busting their ass to pay for a roof over all their children's heads, keep food on the table, and to exist as their own set of human beings but you only view them as your parents. Everything about this post displays immaturity and entitlement. Your parents should honestly kick you out all together until you come back and apologize for being such a brat, thank them and your brother for being gracious enough to let you share your brothers room with him, and offer to help out. I couldn't imagine moving back into my parents home for free and not doing every single thing in my power to help make everyone's lives easier without a complaint. \n\nAn easy way to look at this would be to remove the fact that this is family and see what your complaints sound like. You're an adult and it's time to start acting like one. \n\nI just want to clarify that I do not like that the world isn't a soft kind place with a safety net for everyone, I would prefer that you have a warm place to live where you are safe and don't have to deal with these added stresses in your life, but the world doesn't get that way by complaining or victimizing yourself, it gets they way by rolling up your sleeves and putting the work in. \n\nAlso what the fuck is the nonsense about 1 cat preventing you from getting a job.

Instead of being used at her parents whims, she could be working under reasonable conditions. When you ask yourself whether being on call anytime the parents want to dump your siblings on you or a job where you know in advance when your time off is, I think the choice is clear.", "People keep asking that and she refuses to answer.", "That's why I said it needs to be communicated. Dumping the parenting on OP because the mom is lazy is not all right.\n\nAsking OP, an adult that doesn't need to stay there, to parent in exchange for room and board is a fair enough exchange.", "How often do your parents entertain overnight guests? \nThis situation sucks.", "My mom homeschools my siblings. They don't go to school at all", "In some countries (US included) the children do not have school in the summer months.  Since OP states they are home for the summer it is very likely their little brother is too.", "It\u2019s probably a literal walk-in closet off the master room that they used as a nursery when he was a baby (crib doesn\u2019t take much room).  Hence it going back to being a walk-in closet.  Not exactly an ideal bedroom for anyone, and is the reason OP doesn\u2019t want to be in it.", ">AITA for not wanting to share a room with my little brother?\n\nJust a small reminder of the title.", "Then why did you move Home at all? Even without your Brother you would be St\u00fcck with No Job and No Care...it would have even been better to stay in College town and Flip burgers..how do you Plan to get Out?", "its MAY....do schools close in may? if not there MAYBE  a problem in the making .. but I also guess no child will spend the whole 3 summer month in door.. or in their room? arent you guys font of summer camps? we have 2 month hollidays here and even my children go to camps in the summer and when they do not they will be in a pool all day lol", "They\u2019ve already shown that they will kick her out, this seems like a terrible idea.", "That\u2019s a quick way to get kicked out.", "Right or wrong op has no leverage or power or from their comments any money or even a car\u2026 so how exactly are they in any position to tell the people footing all their bills \u201cthis is what\u2019s gonna happen in your house\u201d lol?\n\nRedditors have such main character syndrome, unless op has another place to go (which it certainly doesn\u2019t sound like they do if they\u2019re so miserable yet continuing to stay) this could just make their situation even worse.\n\nParents are dicks but this advice is terrible and completely divorced from reality.", "This. If sis is on board just do it. You may end up moving everything back to avoid getting kicked out, but, you've at least taken a stand and made your point.\n\nFor 6M bathroom shenanigans, bring a small chair in the room with you and wedge it under the door. Little dude won't be able to beat them physics.", "Some do, yes.  Varies by state and school district in the US.  My kids usually get out in May and return in August.  I have family whose kids get out in June and return in September.  There is not a set schedule nationwide.", "She responded directly to you - they are home schooled. If the mother isn't even parenting the rest of the day, I doubt she does it during \"school hours\".", "Camps are expensive and most people actually don't have pools", "You think a 3 year old in a pool requires less supervision than a 3 year old outside of a pool?", "My parents don't love me or give a shit about me and even I don't share this person's horrible opinions.", "Dont you have communal pools? With slides and so in? They are inexpensive Here... everybody goes there", "Does your college/uni offer a resident assistant program where you work for your uni and stay in a room for low/no cost? I've heard some unis do that. \n\nYou can also apply for financial aid through FAFSA if you qualify which I think you will because you're paying out of your own pocket, tho that money is for tuition mainly not room/board, I think. \n\nYou can see about getting a waiver. Waivers might be granted to students who are military veterans or who have excellent grades and you mentioned studying hard, I assume you have studied hard enough to earn good grades so maybe you can qualify for a waiver. \n\nAs others have also mentioned, apply for scholarships wherever you can. Good luck to you with your academic studies and career. Don't listen to the people calling you lazy, you're not being lazy you're just dealing with shit at home and people with too much time on their hands are being needlessly pissed off. Kind of funny how angry and petty some people are being.", "Please go to FAFSA and get yourself some grants to go to school and escape. Sounds like you'll probably qualify. I wish you luck.", "Out of curiosity - if you knew you didn't have enough money why didn't you get a part time job at uni?", "Then take a student loan, because a \u201cgap\u201d year isn\u2019t going to earn the money you need for tuition and a dorm.\n\nOr instead of a year or so of doing nothing, join the military and take advantage of the post-9/11 GI Bill that will fully pay for public school tuition and give you a housing allowance.  Sitting at home for a year will accomplish nothing beyond making it more likely that you never return to school.", "My town doesn't have one, there's 1 in the city next to me that's pretty crowded the whole summer, and there's a water park but it's expensive. Most people I know who don't have a lot of money just keep their kids home all summer", "Don\u2019t take what they\u2019re saying to heart OP, you\u2019re doing the best you can with the cards you\u2019ve been dealt. Hope your situation improves.", "Biking 10 miles isn't that bad, aren't there other roads than a highway?", "wow thats pretty sad...in Europe when there is no beach (or even when there is) you do have pretty inexpensive communal pools everywhere (there are more expensiv waterparks also they are privat and more fancy.. the other ones are paid from tax money.. (no one minds because everyone gets to enjoy them)"]}
