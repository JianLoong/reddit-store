My sister (14F) has her own room. \n\nI came back from college for the summer and I'm probably going to be taking a gap year as well. I was put back in my old room and I'm sharing it with my 6yo brother. My 3yo brother is sharing with my sister. \n\nIt's been hell. I have no privacy at all. My brothers get up at 7am, come into our room, flip the light on and start playing and fighting at full volume. I can't tell them to leave because it's \"their room.\" My mom and sister also come in at all hours of the day without knocking to put laundry or toys away, and leave the door wide open. \n\nI don't have a car and my parents only have one right now, so I haven't gotten a summer job yet. I have nowhere else to go all day so I have my airpods in most of the day to spare my sanity and drown out the constant fighting and noise, which also upsets my mother.\n\nThe 6yo is out of control as well. He bullies everyone and gets away with little to no consequences. I tell him to get out of my stuff and he hits me and runs away. He picks the bathroom lock and bursts in laughing. \n\nWhenever I speak up about these things I get told that I'm insulting my mom's parenting, that I'm ungrateful for having a place to stay, and that I can't make any \"demands\" because I don't pay rent. I have been kicked out for a night before. My mother insists that I must hate my brother, and reads into almost everything I do or say as a direct attack against him. She says that I want to paint him as a \"little villain\" and myself as a victim. So AITA for not wanting to share a room with him?\n\nEdit: I'm taking a gap year because I was paying for college by myself and can't afford it anymore. College is not just a free escape from my situation and I'm not acting \"rich\" or \"spoiled\" by taking a gap year. I literally cannot afford it.\n\nEdit 2: I'm not asking them to rearrange the rooms or force all 3 siblings in one room. I'm not sure where in my post people are reading that. I'm being told that I'm ungrateful for not being happy being woken up by screams at 7am, having the bathroom lock picked, and being hit by a 6yo.

If you were to get your own place you wouldn't be able to save much, meaning it is doubtful you could afford college without taking out hefty student loans. Is it impossible for a 19 year old to move out, support themselves, and pay for college? No. But is it incredibly difficult? Yes. And, to be frank, I've seen more people fail than I have succeed.

You don't have to live there.  You should not have to get a \"summer\" job - you are an adult and you moved out which means you needed a job period.  And yes, you can go to college and work - even if just part time.\n\nGirl, welcome to living at home for free being the oldest kid in the house.  If you don't pay rent - you don't get a say.  You don't get to raise hell about how mom raises the kids because right now - you are literally a kid - a 4th mouth to feed.  You don't have a job; you don't have a car and you are taking a gap year.  I worked full time (paid all of my own college expenses with no help), went to school full time and did my internship and graduated early so that I could get started in life - when I was 19 in rural WV where I had to travel for an hour just to work and go to school.  Where there is a will there is way.  I got a cheap basic car - and I got rides with friends to earn that and when it broke down - I rented a room on the bus line.  I was the oldest of my egg donor's kids.  I lived with my grandparents for a couple of months in HS and my cousins would come stay - younger, my siblings, etc.  Living in a home with kids is always going to be noisy and such.\n\nI have a 20-year son and a 22-year daughter - my daughter lives at home while she goes to school - she got a car - cheap - 800 last year and fixed it.  She drives herself to work and to school.  She lives at home - I also have a 11F and my kids live free with me - so long as they go to school or work (to save up to move out) and none of my kids ever thought they would get to sleep in, listen to ipods all day (priorities) and offer up their limited ideas on my parenting while not working nor going to school - like it is summer break they are 10. Instead, what is expected - they get up early - just like me as I go to work to earn the money providing them with their current standard of living, they clean their room, they help clean the house and do yard work, go to work, come home, run errands for me if needed and take care of their own business and if I ask them to help out with their youngest sibling - they do so without complaint or advise on what a spoiled kids I am raising (that is how you are coming across).  Because they know that I am paying for the housing, the utilities, the insurance, the food and all the other things they are enjoying for free.  They also know they don't have to argue with a kid - if she is acting up - they deal with it because I don't referee.  She respects them so she listens to them for the most part - depends on what they want.  If they want to sleep in - silence well then, they use noise canceling headphones because they know better than to complain about sleeping in - expecting, it to be quite so they can get their beauty sleep.

During covid his rent went up and he stayed with us for a very short while to raise money to get another apartment.  He had to sleep in the living room.  Yup - was not going to make my daughter's give up rooms to accommodate him and he survived.  He comes home each weekend and hangs out.  And he sleeps in the living room.  What your mom should have done was keep the boys in their room, you sister in hers and gave you the couch.  That way there is no uproar from the kids being forced into new rooms, new timetables and new constraints just because you moved back in.  You don't seem to understand that by moving back in - they are now dealing with a tighter budget - to feed and house you.  They know had to disrupt their kids' daily lives, sleeping arrangements and schedules and you want them to force the kids to do more quiet time, so you can sleep?  I could understand if it was 5 am but adults all over the world are up at 7 am daily and don't die from it.    You want more and more changes to accommodate you and your sleep schedule.  Get up, walk down the road - get on a bus and get a job.  Then save up money and move out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs to others telling you - you are being used and being done wrong and you are ok with your demands - You are not a kid - you are literally an adult.  You are talking about taking at least a year or more time off - meaning you will be in your 20's - expecting to live rent free with no responsibilities - if your parents die today - what are you gonna do?  No one is entitled to live at home free making demands.  If you were some guy and you acted like this to your wife - you would be roasted because there is a double standard with adult spouses and adult children.  I don't make the distinction.  Life will not make the distinction - if something happens to your parents - I promise you - no one - including the reddit avengers are going to offer you a home to live in for free where you can just hang out expecting a later morning wakeup call and getting a nice coffee in silence as the children have been gagged and stuffed in the closet so that you can enjoy peace and quiet.  This disrupted their lives - the kids - and they now get to listen to you talk trash and expect them to keep their daily lives changed to suit you until you get a job, maybe move out, maybe just decide to stay and maybe go back to school.  I figure you parents are wanting to understand that this is temporary and don't get comfy.

If you take this approach and find some work on the side, you\u2019ll: \n\u2022Earn money to put towards school going forward, assuming you\u2019re able to find a job (I suggest looking into remote work, if you\u2019re able to)\n\u2022SAVE money on courses.
