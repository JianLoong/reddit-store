I don\u2019t know her best friend or her daughter, but I didn\u2019t have anything else to do, so whatever. \n\nI thought about it I should shave, since it had been two days since I had. But I decided there was no need, since my facial hair doesn\u2019t grow that fast and two days worth of growth is some extremely light stubble you can\u2019t even see unless you look closely. \n\nWhen my mom saw me, she said she told me to get ready and I should have been clean and neat shaven. I shrugged and said I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, she said we didn\u2019t have time to have me shave so whatever.\n\nAnyways, after the wedding my mom was acting cold towards me, and so I asked what was up.

Facial hair is common amongst men today.  I suspect your mom was used to seeing you clean shaved and in her mind you were being disrespectful because she knew you hadn\u2019t shaved when maybe you normally do.\n\nI say NTA and your mom is over-reacting.  I don\u2019t see any reason anyone would care unless the bridge or groom asked you to do it.", "If it really wasn\u2019t very noticeable then I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s a big deal. You didn\u2019t ruin the wedding because you had some stubble. The bride and groom were probably too caught up in the festivities to even notice. I get where your mom is coming from but NTA", "How old are you? People with facial hair decide when they are going to shave. My husband does not like two or three days growth on his face because he feels like his face just looks dirty. But, if you are comfortable with your face, then I am comfortable with you. NTA.", "NTA. Even if your facial hair was noticeable, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, as long as it didn\u2019t look sloppy.

No heads up?  No right to opinion.", "Omg NTA, your mom needs to get over it. I, personally, think my son (20) looks better with a bit of scruff than clean-shaven, but that's me. Regardless, I'm sure no one even gave a shit that you weren't baby's butt clean shaven. It's not like you were in the wedding party or anything.", "NTA - Not a big deal at all\u2026 I had two days growth at my own daughter\u2019s wedding.", "NTA. Your mother frankly needs to get over herself. A couple is getting married... it's very highly likely one of the last things those two care about is the amount of teenage stubble a 17-year-old boy has.", "Yeah, two days without shaving is nothing. NTA", "NTA - As long as you weren't disheveled, it's find. I really doubt the bride cared and your mom cares way too much about appearances. She's literally the only one that cared that you didn't shave.", "NTA\n\nLight/moderate shadow is a valid look anyway, in general. It looks messy in the close sub-beard zone, but this is not that.", "NTA lmao", "NTA\n\nI feel like anything I say here would be redundant because it's just so obviously n t a.\n\nSincerely,\nA bearded individual", "NTA - Mom is overreacting.", "NTA. Stubble is a perfectly acceptable facial hair situation. Your mom is weirdly controlling about this.", "NTA, I go 7 or 8 months without bc I hate it so much.

Basically, has your mom been the mom at a wedding yet/is it likely to happen in next 5 years?", "YTA-- social events like this might not seem important to you, but they're important opportunities for your mom to show to her friends that she has a clean, respectful family. It would have been nice for you to have represented your mom well by shaving and looking your very best.", "YTA\n\nWhy did you even go if you weren\u2019t going to look presentable? Because she made the comment before the wedding, you should have shaved or not gone to the wedding at all. Going unshaven was essentially just giving her the middle finger, that you don\u2019t care about her opinion (at a wedding that was important to her, not you). Maybe exercise at least a little thoughtfulness in the future. It\u2019s not all about you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Two days worth of facial hair on a teenager is not going to be noticeable or not going to look unruly.  Plus it's a room full of strangers to him so they would not be aware if he normally has facial hair or not.  It's also not the mother's right to tell her almost adult son that he needs to shave.
