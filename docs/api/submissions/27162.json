She knew when payments would end, it's not your fault she didn't prepare for that and you certainly don't owe her anything beyond what you've already given her.

It's unfortunate your son doesn't see what's really going on and I fear you will be the \"bad guy\" if until he one day understands the situation better.", "NTA - that was an agreement that payments would end. What the hell was she doing?!", "NTA obviously if you've set aside money for a college fund you've done exactly your required financial parenting duties, you've supported him until he turned 19, and also are apparently intending on helping him further his education so he can support himself in the future. \n\nYou don't owe anything to the mother, and I say that as a single mother. They knew this was coming they have a year to align those ducks and then it's done. \n\nPeople crying out that you're a bad father are just reacting to the fact that you've only told a tiny portion of the story, me idk maybe you're a good dad maybe you're not but I'm not here to judge you on that, just on financial support which you have provided. \n\nMaybe buy her a nice tent as a parting gift.", "NTA.  But I don't have much sympathy for women who act like leeches.", "Also - that was for raising a child!! And you\u2019re going to put that child through college too - so you\u2019re still paying for him, even though you aren\u2019t obligated to. She should have been supporting herself the whole time. The sad part is - she will guilt that kid into taking care financially of her until her death, I hope he finds a career to make gobs of money", "Why is OP responsible for the mothers bad decisions, lack of action, accountability and poor planning? It really seems she thought the son was a 50-70 year meal ticket. What really messes up a number of the judgements is that OP has a college fund for the son. If he neither loved or cared for his son he would have done the bare minimum probably gone to court and paid the minimum that was ordered and not tried to enable him to set himself up for the future! It actually does not matter how he speaks about the mother. His son is an adult he is not speaking to a 12 year old. What is interesting is that now his future is potentially in jeopardy his father is no longer the bad guy. What is the betting the mother wants the son to forego his education for her house and this has opened the sons eyes to how shortsighted and selfish she is hence the shift. I find it incredible that OP has watched his money be wasted for 18 years, and is being criticised for not continuing. The mother is a bad investment and is on her own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You can\u2019t claim to love your son and continue to reference his mother as a \u201cdumbass\u201d regardless of what and how much you\u2019re paying, that is bound to create resentment and defensiveness from your son.

That way your son knows that you have been more than fair.", "Bro please get in therapy to deal with your anger and resentment issues. You call her \"dumbass\" like 3 different times here. You seem to give zero fucks that your son is despairing over this. My point isn't that you owe her money but that you clearly have unresolved issues stemming from the breakup.

The way you talk, it's obvious you don't give a shit about him. You treat him like a contract that ended after 18 years and to whom you don't owe anything. It doesn't work that way, Drew is your son and you have to contribute financially if he's still in school. Maybe you're right legally, but morally you're wrong. I'm not saying you should buy his mother a house, her demands are exaggerated and it's not your responsibility. But you still have responsibilities towards your son if he's still studying and his mother is broke.\n\nYTA because you're arguing with your 18 year old trying to prove a point, be more mature than that and just explain to him that you won't buy his mother a house instead of playing mind games.\n\nEdit : you say his mother didn't do anything, but she managed everything from A to Z concerning your son while you just wrote a check every month.", "You've been really oppositional with your son and it isn't helping. (I don't blame you for being over supporting his mom. Not one bit. She isn't worth all this stress.) But, your relationship with your son needs to be managed without anger running the engine. He's been cultivated all his life by his mom to *support* her decisions - not to think analytically about them. So, you have to out smart her. Besides, its not like he's never seen a working mom in his life. He just hasn't seen her going to work.\n\n So, tell him, \"I've always planned to secure your future with a good education. If you want to take over managing the bills and helping your mom after you graduate college, I won't complain about that. But, I'm YOUR father - not hers. And I've always told her that I was backstopping her until it was time for you to continue your education. She's had 20 years to plan for this - not two weeks.\"\n\nNTA. omg. This woman is awful. Just remember that when your kid thinks logically - he's becoming the man *you* hoped he'd be. Skip his mom. Just logic around her nonsense.", "Yes, you are the A. Why? Because by your own admission she raised your son. How was she supposed to have a financially prosperous career when she was by herself with a child? If she got to stay home with your son or only work part time then wasn\u2019t it worth it to give your son a present parent? You call her a broke-ass artist but you found her good enough to sleep with, impregnate and let her raise your son. So I am assuming you are actually raising your younger 2 and married their mother?  Look, the mother of your oldest is alone, without you there, so how about your angry self remembering that. And although you shouldn\u2019t have had to, I would have had one of those letters from your attorney sent every single year, not just at 18. It would have simple stated \u201cChild support will end in 16 years\u202615 years\u202614 years\u2026etc.\u201d She may have taken it more seriously then. And yes, she should have invested in a home instead of renting but maybe she needed a landlord to do the repairs or provide lawn or other such services. I mean it\u2019s not like you were there to do it. Be glad your son lived in a good area. The fact is you put a good roof over your sons head and the woman who was raising him.

Hopefully the son will see his mums true colours.\n\nOP you are not and never have been responsible for supporting your ex financially only your son, and you have done that and saved up so he can go to college. Tell her to jog on she's had plenty of time and notice to get a job to take care of her own responsibilities and she's dine jack shit about it  expecting you to cough up. As for your son he will see the truth eventually and see her for what she really is a lazy leech. NTA", "This is the right answer. Where has OPs parenting been to counteract the entitlement?

Calling her a dumbass and that you don't care if she dies on the streets?\n\nThe question as you posed it was if you were the AH *for pitting your son against his mother*. People seem to be missing that point. It's not a question of the finances, it's about the apparent glee you take in insulting your ex and trying to undermine your son's relationship with her.", "So why couldn\u2019t you take your son if it is so dang easy to both have a child AND have a job that pays well enough to set yourself up?", "I feel like an artist who even has a place to live in this economy has probably made some good financial decisions", "He doesn't sound like he'd give her the money anyway, it sounds more like he's happy to see his son's mother struggling and you can't think of yourself as a good father when you clearly say you wouldn't give a fuck if your own son's mom lived in the streets. What about your kid ?\n\nIn all this, he hasn't thought about his son and talks about him as a transaction and an inconvenience that he's finally getting rid of after 19 years - 19 years during which the law obliged him to contribute financially.\n\n>Drew us the one demanding OP pay his mother for no reason.\n\nDrew is 18, suffering and being manipulated by his mother. Instead of acting maturely and explaining things to him, his father confronts him and tells him to choose between his mother and his future. ESH.

To come back and ask he buy a house for her, really? No way. Plus OP has two other kids. I know of plenty of people like this mom who ultimately get used to custody money and they don\u2019t set themselves up right for both their kid and themselves, once they stop receiving payments resulting in a harsh reality check.", "She has a place to live because he\u2019s paying for it. That has nothing to do with her financial prowess.", "Why should he give her the money. Most people have to get jobs, why shouldn't she?", "He's the asshole for the way he talks about them though. Everyone agrees the mother is wrong but all I get from OP's message is that he feels hatred for his son's mother and no empathy for him. The son is just a dumb 18 year old who suffers from seeing his mother in trouble, OP should have been more mature in the way he handled the situation.", "I didn't read it that way. He didn't say he actually pays her rent, just that he pays child support. We don't know what \"generous\" means. He just says \"nice part of town,\" but we don't know if that necessarily means she lives in an expensive apartment, though I think he wants us to think that. Why he wouldn't just say \"she lives in a nice place that I pay for, and will be forced to move\" is beyond me. \n\n\nHe also contradicts himself by saying she asked him to buy a house, but she also insists on renting. What it really sounds like is that she can't afford a down payment. Just seems like he's using tactics to control the narrative, which honest people don't do.", "I mean if she\u2019s claiming that him not paying child support will put her on the streets that\u2019s a pretty heavy implication that it\u2019s paying for her place to live.", "But we don't know if he's paying all of it or a fraction. We don't even know if she'll actually be on the street, or if she was just being hyperbolic and manipulative. It's so vague, and the language is manipulating the reader into assuming things are worse than the facts might reveal. I dunno. Don't assume that just because he's paying child support that he's an angel. This all sounds very high drama to me."]}
