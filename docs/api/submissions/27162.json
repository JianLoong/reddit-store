If he neither loved or cared for his son he would have done the bare minimum probably gone to court and paid the minimum that was ordered and not tried to enable him to set himself up for the future! It actually does not matter how he speaks about the mother. His son is an adult he is not speaking to a 12 year old. What is interesting is that now his future is potentially in jeopardy his father is no longer the bad guy. What is the betting the mother wants the son to forego his education for her house and this has opened the sons eyes to how shortsighted and selfish she is hence the shift. I find it incredible that OP has watched his money be wasted for 18 years, and is being criticised for not continuing.

You call her a broke-ass artist but you found her good enough to sleep with, impregnate and let her raise your son. So I am assuming you are actually raising your younger 2 and married their mother?  Look, the mother of your oldest is alone, without you there, so how about your angry self remembering that.
