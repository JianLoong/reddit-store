My dad and grandpa both told her to STFU. \n\nI basically stopped talking to her after that. I would be civil and greet her if we saw each other but other than that we didn't speak. \n\nShe got divorced last year and this summer she went on her first solo vacation on like 20 years or something. \n\nShe also got a tattoo of a sea turtle on her ankle. \n\nShe was showing it off to everyone saying how it represents her inner strength and peace. \n\nI was on the couch with my grandma when she came by to show it off. It was nice work so I complemented her on it. And then I smirked. I did not say anything, I did not remind her of what she said. Nothing. \n\nShe saw the look on my face and then she freaked out. She said her tattoo was a deeply personal thing and that she didn't need a child judging her. \n\nMy grandma told her to calm down because I hadn't said anything. She said that I thought she was an attention whore slut. \n\nIn all honesty I probably made it worse by laughing at that point. I asked her why she said that when all I had done was complement the artwork. \n\nShe went incoherent then and left. I'm super glad I had my grandmother as a witness because everyone thought I had insulted my aunt or something. Her own mom said she was nuts and that I had been polite. \n\nShe has been texting and calling everyone and saying she will only come back if I apologize. \n\nMy mom says that I should try and keep the peace. \n\nI'm thinking of calling her and apologizing and saying that I personally don't think people with tattoos are bad people and asking her why she thought I had that running through my head.
