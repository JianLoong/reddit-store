{"id": 27452, "submission_id": "16q2apn", "title": "AITA for setting boundaries with my brother regarding his wife?", "selftext": "My brother IB (Idiot Brother-mid 30s) and I (20s F), fought recently over some boundaries I set with his wife CW (Cheating Wife-late 20s). The 2 of them are a constant source of stress for the whole family. They're always fighting, and trying to make it everyone else's problem too. They have 2 kids (3,7) and a 3rd on the way.\r  \n\r  \n2 days ago, it was recently discovered CW was cheating again. Shocker I know. But she was bringing their 3yo with her and leave them in the car, alone, while she was hooking up. And IB decided to forgive her... Yeah, you read that right. He forgave her for ENDANGERING their 3yo child and leaving them in a car alone for an unspecified period of time. CW even admitted she was doing this in the middle of the summer too! They could have died in the hot car!\r  \n\r  \nIB then tried asking our older brothers wife and I, to hang out with CW more. I think he's hoping that if she's with girl friends CW wouldn't cheat and we could keep her in line? Frankly I don't think anything could stop her at this point, this seems to have been going on for their whole relationship.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, I've long sense reached my limit with CW. If the conversation isn't about her she will make it about her. Every time she gets caught cheating she plays the victim card as if it's not her fault she cheated on IB. Hell, on a previous confrontation about her cheating, she assaulted IB for not believing her lies about where she was and having evidence she was cheating.\r  \n\r  \nSo when IB asked us to hang out with CW more I felt I had to make it clear that unless I have to, ie. for the sake of their kids, I will not have anything to do with her going forward. Their never ending drama has done nothing but cause me constant stress and anxiety. I've already done my best to be LC with them as possible. CW can go pound sand for all I care.. or whatever random guy she's hooking up with that day. Our older brothers wife said more or less the same thing. She's also pregnant and is supposed to be on bed rest and avoiding stress as she has high blood pressure.\r  \n\r  \nWell IB didn't like our responses. He called us selfish b\\*tches for not even attempting to forgive CW. That she was the mother of his children (debatable) and that she won't be going anywhere anytime soon so we might as well learn to get along. That he loves her and she loves him (again debateable). He finished off with a jab at why my ex and I broke up. Saying that since I'm so selfish and only think about myself it's no wonder why he left me.\r  \n\r  \nI laughed and retorted, \"that's rich coming from a man who can't keep his wife from running off to sleep with other men and asking others to keep her in line. There's nothing more selfish than people wanting others to handle their problems for them.\"\r  \n\r  \nNow he's mad and giving everyone the silent treatment. Most of us our enjoying the silence. I don't think I'm TA, but some friends I vented to said it wouldn't kill me to help IB keep CW in line to keep the peace. \r  \n\r  \nSo, Aita?", "created_utc": 1695469137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q2apn/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_brother/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think now unless it's about family stuff I won't be replying to IB anymore. Though I have already blocked CW awhile ago.

It's very exhausting.", "Yes. They were mad about that. But because they're married they think we should try to keep the peace since I'll have to keep dealing with them in the future for at least birthdays and holidays.", "Already have. But because I did it anonymously I didn't get feedback aside from what IB learned. Apparently because there's no proof of neglect and abuse they basically just showed up, checked the house was safe, had a quick chat with each kid, and left. I wanna hope they're on the watch list.", "We can only hope. I'd love to have a whole week of silence from their nonsense at least.

I'm not the one who disturbed it. I just wanted away from the stress.\n\nSo im doing my best to enjoy this silence. Been catching up on sleep whenever I can. People really underestimate how much stress gets you.", "The immediate family is actually in talks of pooling money together to afford that. Sadly most of us have pretty tight monthly budges since covid and 1 parent being retired. But if we do, we'd probably wait until baby #3 arrives. Do all 3 at the same time.\n\nThankfully my other brothers and I watch the kids semi regularly. So it shouldn't be too hard to get samples from them. Baby 3 especially should be easy since babies are drool machines. IB we might have to trick or just go with his hair.", "Yeah, we've all tried to get him to see reason. But it's like they both refuse to acknowledge that they shouldn't be together anymore if they're always fighting and she's always cheating. It's like talking to a brick wall.\n\nSo I decided that unless it's for the kids I'm done with the politeness she doesn't deserve. Best she gets is a mention in the Christmas card. Mostly so my 7yo nibling doesn't ask why their moms name isn't on the card too.", "Good plan. My cats and I have been enjoying the lack of stress and noise.", "Yeah we've tried telling him that before the silent treatment started. He didn't listen. I've tried to get several family members in some kind of therapy. But sadly no one listens to me. They all think I'm the weird one for being in therapy.. the denial is strong in this family apparently.", "That sounds like a great back up plan lol", "It's been waaaaay more than 3 times. We've confirmed at least a dozen. Most knew she was married too. IB needs some sense knocked into him somehow. This is not something the kids should be seeing and thinking is normal.", "I have made an anonymous report to CPS. They didn't really do much. They came, did a look around, talked with each kid, and left. I'm hoping they'll be kept on a watch list. They may not show or have proof, but these kids are not in a healthy home environment mentally.", "I've already placed anonymous reports to the CPS. They have barely done anything yet. But I'm hoping they're on a watch list. They think their neighbours placed the calls thankfully.", "Yeah. Idk why he thinks we could control a grown woman's actions.", "Pretty much how my oldest brothers wife seen it. There's no way they wouldn't find a reason to blame us.", "No clue.

Would probably have better luck with keeping them out of trouble lol", "God I wish I could convince them to go to therapy. I've had no luck convincing anyone in my family to seek professional help.

Nice and quiet.. well, as quiet as a home gets with 2 young ish cats.", "Pretty much. Our oldest brother is thinking of doing the same thing. Keep the wife and their kid away from their nonsense as much as possible. Thankfully they got time to make solid plans. Their baby isn't due til around Halloween.", "If only we could convince them to divorce. For some reason they just won't. They usually say they stay together for the kids, but we're all pretty certain that's a lie.", "Planning on it. Thankfully they think it's their neighbours who called CPS. They're already on bad terms with most of them due to their constant fighting. Wouldn't surprise me if the really were calling CPS too.
