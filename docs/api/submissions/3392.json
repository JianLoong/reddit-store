When my then boyfriend (28 M) now husband and I was going to announce our pregnancy to our parents my MIL surprised us and said she already knew. Because I was sending out signals.. I wasn't showing or anything so I thought it must have been small signals that someone who had been pregnant themselves would notice. And she refused to tell me what I had done that gave it away and said I would just not do that in front of her next time. But no hard feelings.  It's the first grandchild for both family's so the joy is never ending.  A couple of moths later my boyfriend and I decided that we want to get married, but we don't really fancy parties and decided just to invite our moms out for dinner and then \"accidentally\" visit the court house first and surprise them. After the wedding my MIL again said that she knew, and I was the one who had given her the signals! I was choked, because I had not spoken to her at all. Other than inviting her out for dinner, to celebrate the baby's gender. The rest of the day went well and was filled with joy, but I did notice my mom(58) and MIL whispering a lot to each other. When we got home I went to my moms and asked what it was all about( she's our neighbor). She said what I was not allowed to tell my husband, but my MIL never logged out of his samsung account when she got his old phone. So she can see our messenger conversation.. I WAS FURIOUS! She had been reading me and my husband's text for god knows how long! Every picture I had send him from the scans at the clinics, and pictures we send each other of ring designs we liked! I DIDN'T SEND SIGNALS! I only texted my husband like every other couple does! Of cause I told my husband and he wasn't nearly as mad as me. He was more mad on my behalf. And now.. I honestly don't know how to feel. I feel betrayed by a person I love and respected.. and since I leaned this, every little thing my MIL does actually piss me off.. and I hate this feeling! My husband is asking if I want him to talk to her but I don't want to have them at each other's throats.. but one thing I know is, that I will never trust my MIL the same way again.

You can't possibly trust her. This is the most grotesque invasion of privacy imaginable. How long did your mother know about this and why didn't she tell you?", "NTA but why didn\u2019t your own mother tell you as soon as she learned what MIL was doing? It might be best for you and your marriage to move far away from both mothers. And, make darn certain no one else has access to any of your accounts.", "NTA\n\nFor husband not to see this as a big deal makes me wonder what his life was like growing up with her and what he\u2019s been conditioned to expect.\n\nShocked you had to ask your mom about it rather than her immediately telling you both. You\u2019re not allowed to tell your husband? She was okay with your MIL continuing to spy on your husband\u2019s phone?!\n\nThis is such a violation. I honestly couldn\u2019t have anything to do with her again.", "NTA, that was an extreme violation of privacy. You also have an SO problem. He should equally offended, and it is appalling that he is not.", "Send your husband a text. Tell him your friend just told you her MIL has secretly been reading all the emails and texts between herself and her husband. Say can you believe that? What kind of person would violate someone\u2019s trust and privacy like that?? How hurt your friend is. How she\u2019s now thinking about keeping her MIL from meeting her grand kids because she can\u2019t trust her, and you don\u2019t blame. How thankful you are that nobody in your family would ever do something like that that to you, so painful and violating. How your friend said if her MIL has admitted what she has done before getting caught, and stopped immediately, she might\u2019ve forgiven her. And you agree with that sentiment and find it admirable.\n\nBut it\u2019s made you realize you don\u2019t take data security as serious as you should. And then request your husband contact the phone company and email company and make sure nobody else has access to your accounts, since that\u2019s a thing they can tell you if requested.\n\nHave your husband agree with everything you said and keeping the grandkids away from them is a good call since they\u2019ve proven they can\u2019t be trust and that he\u2019ll contact the phone companies asap. \n\nThen see what happens\n\n\n\nAlso wether or not you guys do something like that. He should for sure contact the phone company asap and get her access taken away. Def change the password to his account and log out everywhere.", "NTA.  This is disgusting.  Your MIL has been invading your most intimate, private moments for years, and lying to your face over and over.  Meanwhile, your mom found out about it & didn't bother to tell you until you pushed her.  Oh dear.  Trying not to be judgmental here, but your MIL is a terrible, intrusive person & you cannot trust her at all.  Ever.  There's no coming back from this.  If she's in your house, lock up private documents & the medicine cabinet.  Over time, you might forgive her for this betrayal & continue to love the very, very severely flawed individual she is.  But you still can't trust her as far as you can throw your car.  As in, not at all.  You get to be hurt, angry, and confused as you renegotiate relationship with MIL you thought you could trust.  I'm so sorry. \\[Edited to correct a reaction to something I misread about the mom. Maybe her mom didn't want to give her bad news on her wedding day.\\]", "NTA - but I\u2019d do something to catch her in the act since she\u2019ll probably deny reading private messages. Like write you decided on a baby name and make it really outlandish and bizarre. Or talk about moving out of country because you were given a job offer you couldn\u2019t refuse.", "I would start texting wild stories. Let out enough rope so MIL will hang herself. She needs to be embarrassed.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And I would send a text that blatantly says \u201choney, now that we know your mother has been and is continuing to read all of our private texts, I just wanted to send a message to follow up on our conversation about how she has irrevocably broken our trust and single-handedly destroyed my relationship with her with this absolutely shameless and grotesque violation of privacy. I am no longer comfortable having her in my house and I will be nothing but honest about why our relationship has fractured with anyone who asks. I am, of course, not going to stop you from having a relationship with her, but this text will be the last thing she hears from me until she is able to offer a genuine apology and explanation for her actions. And even then I am not sure if I will have the wherewithal to welcome her back into my life. As you know, I am incredibly hurt and disturbed by this. Also, can you pick up some milk?\u201d", "NTA - that\u2019s a gross violation and really creepy. \ud83d\udea9", "Is she logged out of his account now??", "NTA - this woman has no boundaries.  You should only text your husband messages that arn't true .  if she is gossiping then be sure to include stuff that will get her into trouble for spreading lies.\n\nthat your husband thinks this is OK, is a little creepy.  He is used to his mother being intrusive", "NTA obviously, but it would prob be best if you spoke to her directly. Hopefully she feels embarrassed. Hearing an apology from her (at the very least) should be the start to the road towards forgiving and forgetting", "NTA\n\nI hope you have signed the device out now so that she can't read anymore messages!", "NTA, Start sending wildly explicit texts that will make MIL wish she was blind...have fun with it. \"Honey, the orgy got moved to 7. Don't forget to pick up the pickles and vaseline.\"", "NTA, but your husband's underreaction should have you concerned about *his* boundaries with his mom. \n\nYou don't want them at each others' throats, but you *do* need to know why he's not concerned about this. Is it possible he knew it was happening? That she talked him into keeping quiet about it? Or is she so off her rocker that he actually thinks this is no big deal? Whatever the reason, his underreaction does not make me hopeful about his willingness to enforce *any* boundaries with his mother. \n\nOnce you've figured out why he doesn't seem to think this incredible invasion of privacy and breach of trust is a big deal, you need to sit him down and tell him - *tell, don't ask* \\- what your *and your baby's* boundaries with your MIL are, and then talk with him about how he's going to not only respect but defend those boundaries. \n\nAnd if he underreacted because he genuinely thinks this is no big deal, then he has some super warped views on the appropriate boundaries between parents and kids, and he probably should do some therapy so as not to pass that on to *your* kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's almost unbelievable that she would think that's okay. Your private conversations are not for her entertainment. I think she should be confronted and told what she did was wrong. It doesn't have to be a high noon confrontation with angry recriminations. I think a quiet word with both you and your husband present would be appropriate. Your husband has to be the one to do the talking though and that might pose a problem if he's not as outraged as he should be in the circumstances. Don't let yourself get emotional about this. What she did is plain wrong and there is no excuse for it. She should apologize and, hopefully, be embarrassed by what she's done. \n\nHow has the account sign off been handled if nobody has spoken to MIL?", "Obviously NTA.

Let him know that while you don\u2019t want him to confront his mom, you expect him to have your back and not tell her things early.

Btw my final text would be, so do you think MIL realizes we know she is abusing our trust and reading this right now yet?", "NTA, this is a massive invasion of privacy.
