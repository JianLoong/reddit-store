When my then boyfriend (28 M) now husband and I was going to announce our pregnancy to our parents my MIL surprised us and said she already knew. Because I was sending out signals.. I wasn't showing or anything so I thought it must have been small signals that someone who had been pregnant themselves would notice. And she refused to tell me what I had done that gave it away and said I would just not do that in front of her next time. But no hard feelings.  It's the first grandchild for both family's so the joy is never ending.  A couple of moths later my boyfriend and I decided that we want to get married, but we don't really fancy parties and decided just to invite our moms out for dinner and then \"accidentally\" visit the court house first and surprise them. After the wedding my MIL again said that she knew, and I was the one who had given her the signals! I was choked, because I had not spoken to her at all. Other than inviting her out for dinner, to celebrate the baby's gender. The rest of the day went well and was filled with joy, but I did notice my mom(58) and MIL whispering a lot to each other. When we got home I went to my moms and asked what it was all about( she's our neighbor). She said what I was not allowed to tell my husband, but my MIL never logged out of his samsung account when she got his old phone. So she can see our messenger conversation.. I WAS FURIOUS! She had been reading me and my husband's text for god knows how long! Every picture I had send him from the scans at the clinics, and pictures we send each other of ring designs we liked! I DIDN'T SEND SIGNALS! I only texted my husband like every other couple does! Of cause I told my husband and he wasn't nearly as mad as me. He was more mad on my behalf. And now.. I honestly don't know how to feel. I feel betrayed by a person I love and respected.. and since I leaned this, every little thing my MIL does actually piss me off.. and I hate this feeling!

Trying not to be judgmental here, but your MIL is a terrible, intrusive person & you cannot trust her at all.  Ever.  There's no coming back from this.  If she's in your house, lock up private documents & the medicine cabinet.  Over time, you might forgive her for this betrayal & continue to love the very, very severely flawed individual she is.

I am no longer comfortable having her in my house and I will be nothing but honest about why our relationship has fractured with anyone who asks. I am, of course, not going to stop you from having a relationship with her, but this text will be the last thing she hears from me until she is able to offer a genuine apology and explanation for her actions.

Whatever the reason, his underreaction does not make me hopeful about his willingness to enforce *any* boundaries with his mother. \n\nOnce you've figured out why he doesn't seem to think this incredible invasion of privacy and breach of trust is a big deal, you need to sit him down and tell him - *tell, don't ask* \\- what your *and your baby's* boundaries with your MIL are, and then talk with him about how he's going to not only respect but defend those boundaries. \n\nAnd if he underreacted because he genuinely thinks this is no big deal, then he has some super warped views on the appropriate boundaries between parents and kids, and he probably should do some therapy so as not to pass that on to *your* kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your husband has to be the one to do the talking though and that might pose a problem if he's not as outraged as he should be in the circumstances. Don't let yourself get emotional about this.
