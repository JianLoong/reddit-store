The relationship was incredibly toxic but, due to social pressure (we were both from a very conservative community in Texas), after High School we ended up getting married. While I don't want to wish Mike and ill-will, the relationship was awful. It was clear we had both lost feelings for each other and, after we cheated on each other numerous times and counseling failed us, we divorced. There were no hard feeling and this was only 1 year and a half later mind you.\n\nThen Mike transffered to a school on the East Coast. A year later, my little sister got admitted into an equally great school in the same state as Mike. Now at the time, this just didn't register in my brain, but their schools were incredibly close to each other.\n\nI moved on with my life, and soon I got into my current loving relationship with my current boyfriend. Eventually my parents came around to accept him and we all moved on with our lives. Then 5 years passed and last week on my father's birthday when, like always, we all came home.\n\nThis time however, my sister brought her long-time boyfriend, who none of had seen (or knew anything about) but all of us knew existed: Mike (Clarification: I did not know it was my ex-husband, all I knew is that she had been dating someone for a long time). She brought my ex-husband to my father's birthday and worst of all, she did it because they were engaged. I kid you not, I wanted to puke when I saw this.\n\nIt took me an hour to register what the hell was happening. As soon as it did though I just started yelling at my sister. The whole thing just came crashing down upon me, and I was furious. The whole event got so bad that my sister left the party and went to a hotel until her flight the next day. While my parents supported me but my boyfriend was distraught.\n\nSoon we left, and on the ride back, he just didn't say anything. When I finally pried something out of him, he just said \"Why did you do all that back there? Do you still have feelings for Mike?\". After an hour of explaining, he eventually said \"Then what was the point of all that? Its been 5 years since you two dated. Your sister is a grown adult\". Then I told friends, and there were also split. Half of them supported me and half supported my boyfriend. (Edit: I did manage to show him of my perspective eventually and we are fine, don't worry...it isn't about Mike, he understands that, its about my sister). \n\nWith all this information AITA?\n\n**1st EDIT:** I changed it from saying that I cheated on him 4 times, to we both cheated on each other. I was giving my pespective, but yes he cheated on me as well. That's why the relationship was so toxic.\n\n**2nd EDIT:** I care because its a betrayal of my trust in my sister. She knew him the whole time we were married. He came to our house, yet still you go on and date him to now marry him.

Happy birthday, dad!", "NTA\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t have feelings, it\u2019s a shock to show up to a family event and your EX HUSBAND IS ENGAGED TO YOUR SISTER.

One daughter had a high school sweetheart, they split, it was amicable, and she had no more feelings for him.  A few years later, the other daughter bumped into him, one thing led to another, they began dating.  And daughter one, who had not so much mentioned this ex in years and was happily married, flipped and never forgave it.  Would never speak to her sister again, would not go to sister's wedding to the ex, would not share holidays with her, and finally, when the sister got pregnant, demanded that the parents never see her, or their grandchild, again.\n\nThe mother was clearly a wreck over the whole thing.
