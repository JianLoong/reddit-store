That is a treadmill he uses literally every time he comes into the gym.\nMaybe even if the gym is full and all the treadmills are in use he will wait an hour just to use that treadmill.\nIf he was trying to talk to you, or looking at you, or acknowledging you in any way, it would have been way different.\nBut as is, again, NTA, but at the same time completely f****** pointless.", "These yta answers are down right hilarious.

Yes. But its also a non issue, until you made it one.", "I'm gonna say NTA because even though you made a comment, you decided to move to a different treadmill.

You weren\u2019t, up until the point you designated yourself the gym-courtesy-police.

He had plenty of treadmills to choose from at that time, and chose a different one than the one he used on the day with me. Point is that it's common courtesy to give people ample space when able to. If the gym were full of people, it would be a completely different story. That's not the case here.", "Why is there something wrong with wanting space? If there is no space to give, that's one thing, but when there is plenty of space for people to spread out, why not do so out of common courtesy?", "Nope, I'm a man and the other gym member was also a man. Funnily enough, the same thing has happened to me in public restrooms. I went in and walked all the way to back of the restroom to use the very last urinal. All others were empty.

I guess it's just one of those things that comes down to personal preference.", "You said he didn't he even notice you, you don't own the gym and it's rude to talk to people like that. You usually pick the one at the end, you're used to it, it could be the same for the other guy.

I\u2019d rather not be near anyone else, but that particular machine is a beautiful thing. It\u2019s not like he sat there and waited for you to finish using the treadmill you were on. That would have been rude. A simple \u201chey\u201d to newcomers and putting your earbuds in works, too. He\u2019s got every right to use any machine, since he pays for a membership, too.

He's right that he could use whatever machine he wanted, but he has to know people are gonna feel uncomfortable if he picks the one machine next to another person, and you had every right to change machines; after all, \"it's a free country.\"\n\nI've done the same thing. I was on the elliptical in the middle of the day, my gym has about 15 ellipticals and I was the only one using one, so there were 14 other ellipticals and 13 of them weren't right next to me (because, like OP, I was on the end of a row), but some dude decides to use the one next to me. I decide not to give him a hard time and simply move to a different machine that didn't have anyone next to it. But thankfully, while he may have been a little confused and maybe even hurt, he didn't give me a hard time.\n\nSome people do go to the gym to be near other people. Maybe they live alone and the gym helps them feel less isolated. Maybe they like the idea of being a part of a fitness community. Some people just generally like to be near the other person/people in the room. No hate to them, but just because someone wants to be near you, doesn't mean *you* have to be near them. You're always allowed to move, especially when someone is making you uncomfortable.\n\nETA I missed the detail that he said \"really dude\" before moving, and I do think OP was better off not saying anything. I stand corrected and I am sorry, but the rest of my comment stands, there's nothing wrong with wanting a little space and moving machines when someone is too close.
