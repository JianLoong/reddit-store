You noticed him, he didn't notice you. \nGiven, I would probably you've chosen the furthest one from you just because I'm kind of the same mindset, but at the same time really doesn't f****** matter if the person that uses the treadmill next to you doesn't communicate with you or notice you in any way.\nMaybe unbeknownst to you. That is a treadmill he uses literally every time he comes into the gym.\nMaybe even if the gym is full and all the treadmills are in use he will wait an hour just to use that treadmill.\nIf he was trying to talk to you, or looking at you, or acknowledging you in any way, it would have been way different.\nBut as is, again, NTA, but at the same time completely f****** pointless.", "These yta answers are down right hilarious.

Just getting up and moving would've made enough of a statement.", "YTA\nYour comment was rude and unnecessary.

There was no reason to be rude.", "NTA - it's just weird and a bit rude to choose the treadmill right next to someone when all the others are empty.", "Just don't say anything and move. Maybe it was his favourite treadmill or whatever. He is right that it is a free country and if he didn't interact with you, I don't see an issue.

Yes. But its also a non issue, until you made it one.", "I'm gonna say NTA because even though you made a comment, you decided to move to a different treadmill.

Better fan/ventilation, better view of tvs, less noise from the rest of people using other gym equipment?

You weren\u2019t, up until the point you designated yourself the gym-courtesy-police.

He had plenty of treadmills to choose from at that time, and chose a different one than the one he used on the day with me. Point is that it's common courtesy to give people ample space when able to. If the gym were full of people, it would be a completely different story. That's not the case here.", "Why is there something wrong with wanting space? If there is no space to give, that's one thing, but when there is plenty of space for people to spread out, why not do so out of common courtesy?", "Nope, I'm a man and the other gym member was also a man.

You assumed that OP didn\u2019t want to deal with a potential creep only for OP to show that he actually got a creep mindset.", "I fully understand you don't want guys to flirt with you there. What I'm saying is if I were a woman, it would almost make more sense to me that he came to run next to me for that reason, not that I would want him to.", "If not me, then who, because apparently no one else had done it.", "Except two people don\u2019t use the same treadmill. In the bus analogy it\u2019s not rude to take an empty seat next to or behind an occupied seat even if there are other seats not near an occupied seat available", "Well, I would agree with you, but there's no point in both of us being wrong.", "You can tell alot about a person when they say things like that they think they need to 'educate' people lol", "If I simply moved he wouldn't have known my reason for doing so.", "I've seen him there at a similar time when the gym was also relatively empty. Most treadmills available and he used one towards the front that is more convenient for people.", "I don't expect anyone to know that. What I expect is for people to provide common courtesy whenever they possibly can. One way of doing that is to give people space whenever possible.", "Apparently you weren't taught common courtesy towards your fellow man or woman. I was, and I go out of my way to be courteous to people. If that makes me an asshole for expecting the same in return, I'm fine with that.", "There is a reason the most crowded cities in the world are also widely known as the most stressed. Anyone who doesn't know this is a bad thing has been living with their head up their ass.", "It's the early morning devils advocates \ud83e\udd23", "When you have the ability to give people personal space, you do. It's the same reason you don't pick the urinal right next to the only guy in the bathroom. It's common courtesy.", "I never claimed to own the gym. As most of the replies would suggest, it's simply weird to pick that treadmill when all others are empty. I'm not claiming he had any intentions at all besides running. The point is, we live in a very crowded world. If you have the opportunity to give someone space, it's common courtesy to do so. I do for others any chance I can.", "Agreed", "Well maybe he's gay?", "Doesnt matter its not for you to do. Besides somebody that does something like that and uses 'its a free country' as justification isnt interested in learning anyway.", "So how do you know he didn\u2019t use that exact treadmill every time he comes in and have a mental thing where he needs to use it? Or he\u2019s just a creature of habit. You aren\u2019t more special than him. Move without comment.", "OMG, that is soooooo original. Holy crap. You really are a piece of work. \n\nOh, also ... YTA", "But you weren\u2019t clear, you relied on implied social understanding to \u201ceducate\u201d. If you had really wanted to educate him, might I suggest actually using direct language: \u201chey - it can make people uncomfortable when you pick a machine next to someone in a room full of available machines\u201d\n\nEither you need to work on effective communication skills or you\u2019re trying to justify your actions after the fact. \n\nI stand by my judgment.", "This seems oddly stalkerish.  Are you okay?", "This has nothing to do with common courtesy, everything to do with your twisted sense of entitlement. I'm not going to engage with you further my little man.", "Did you know that some autistic and neurodivergent folks have trouble sensing where their body is in space and can often use objects or other people to orient themselves? Like it\u2019s actual thing. That\u2019s just a single example of how by enforcing your \u201ccommon courtesy education\u201d bullshit you are not bothering to find out if the person that you think is so rude actually experiences the world the way you do.\n\nAnyone ever tell you that you give off D-Fen/William Foster vibes?", "I was going to say n a h but yta. You\u2019re fighting with everyone that says yta. And the guy could not know you were not comfortable. And when you told him you were a jerk! You were the one not comfortable so you just had to move and not say shit. Or say something in a nice way. Because no where you say the guy said something rude to you. He just had the audacity of going to the treadmill next to you.", "This is a copy and pasted comment.", "With the bathroom example, do you do this out of common courtesy for other person or out of personal comfort? Both?", "Do you take your penis out on a treadmill? No? Well then it\u2019s a completely different thing isn\u2019t it.", "it's not common courtesy, and while their choice might not be justified by you, it doesn't have to be.\nDown vote me to hell, I'll die on this hill", "Everyone jumped to that conclusion because you did not specify your gender in your OP. They thought the guy was a creeper.\n\nChange your OP to specify that you are MALE (as you clarified in other comments) and I can guarantee you you'd have different replies.", "Could be, but it's still weird. People are at the gym for a reason, and that reason isn't for socializing.", "Yes, I know, my God, expecting common courtesy out of someone! How dare I?", "Agree to disagree then", "Maybe the guy has noticed OPs gaze all the other times he was at the gym, thought he was being coy, and was trying to see if he took a machine close to him OP would strike up a conversation/ask him out. OPs been creeping on him and watching at the gym and now crying foul over such a tiny non offense", "Yes, wanting everyone to respect each other and show courtesy makes me sooooo entitled. \ud83d\ude02", "There are plenty of \"objects\" around for the people with those unfortunate afflictions to use without needing to use another person. As I said, if expecting respect and courtesy from my fellow man makes me an asshole, I'm fine with that.", "Both for sure.", "I'm not going to downvote you. We simply disagree, and that's fine.", "Fuck that. I'm right here on the hill with you.", "Gender really shouldn't matter. When able to provide space, do so. Anything else is just being an asshole.", "No they would be the same. Its creepy always. Im so sick of the \"if gender were different\" shit. Asshole behavior stays asshole behavior. Just because you would judge differently doesn't mean everyone is a hypocrite", "Funny that you said it's normal for a man to go flirt with a woman at a gym, but when it's a man flirting with a man: \n\n>People are at the gym for a reason, and that reason isn't for socializing", "It isn't \"common courtesy.\" It's you having main character syndrome. They weren't in your space and they weren't talking to you.", "You're N T A for being weirded out but 100% YTA for being a controlling obsessive freak thinking he needs to educate others. Educate yourself into not being a weird creep yourself.", "How is using the treadmill next to yours disrespectful, though? Honest question.", "Unfortunate afflictions? Neurodiversity is not an affliction. Having people like you talk about it in such a degrading and condensing way is however.", "The guy who was unnecessarily rude to a stranger wants to lecture on respect and courtesy.\n\nI enjoy your humor, sir!", "\u201c\u2026if that makes me an asshole, I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d\n\nNope. You absolutely aren\u2019t fine with it, because you continue to argue with everyone in the thread who disagrees with you. YTA.", "\ud83e\udee1", "So, if you think that\u2019s the case, why the fuck are you wasting everyone\u2019s time here?\n\nWhy post in the first place", "I didn't say it's normal for a man to flirt with a woman at the gym. What I said was if I were a woman, it would make more sense to me because I know some guys do that.", "There's a reason the most crowded cities in the world are also widely known as the most stressed. It's \"common\" knowledge for everyone not living with their head up their ass.", "Telling the truth to someone is rude now? Hmmm, ok.", "Wheres the fucking hill? You die, bruh? \nI was with you. \ud83d\ude2d", "Just wanted to see how many people were as clueless as this other guy was", "And  gay guys don\u2019t flirt with men?", "He wasn't crowding you. He was on his machine, you were on yours. You're not the main character, get over yourself", "I was referring to your behavior from the op. No truth there, just rude.", "OP and I are good, it's the lurkers I'm fighting.", "\"I asked for opinions, but when I found out other people disagree with me, I've decided THEY'RE the clueless ones.\"", "I wish I could vote twice.", "As stated, if expecting respect & courtesy makes me an asshole, I'm fine with it. In the words of the great Will McAvoy, I'm on a mission to civilize.", "Too bad, so sad"]}
