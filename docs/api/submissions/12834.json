She has terrible morning sickness and everything seems to get her sick, the doctor said it was normal and that we should get rid/ try to avoid the smells that make her sick. Basically every strong smells gets her sick, for example she has had to give up scented candles (which she loves to light up when she's working/ having a bath) because the smell make her nauseous now.\n\nWell another thing that makes her sick is the smell of meat cooking/ cooked. You know how it is, when you're cooking somw type of meat the whole apartment (which is rather small) is filled with a strong smell. I cook for us always. Recently she asked me to not cook meat anymore until the sickness is done or until the pregnancy is over in case it never ends. She told me that each time I cook meat she has to run to the bathroom to throw up. She said that we could eat vegetarian food/ vegan food for now. \n\nI'm not completely against the idea if eating vegetarian/ vegan food some times a week, but every day? That's too much to ask. I feel like she's been unreasonable with this request. I told her that we could eat veggies for 3/4 foods per week but that I can't compromise to just eat veggies for every meal for months. She told me that this way it means that she'll have to be sick every other day because I just want to be selfish. I don't feel I'm being selfish, I feel like she is. I have to stop eating what I want just for her?

Second of all, this is for a limited amount of time.  Morning sickness is more than just throwing up.  It's really not uncommon for pregnant individuals to be hospitalized due to morning sickness (I had a friend spend 3 days in the hospital on fluids, for instance, because she was so sick she couldn't even drink water).  Third, you can eat meat outside the house.  Grab a hamburger, brush your teeth after.\n\nGod, your wife is carrying your kid.

You'd rather have your wife puking her guts out than just...do this one little thing for the person with whom you are going to eventually be raising a child? Do you even care that she has to be sick every day because you're being unreasonable and selfish? \n\nNot to mention, raising a child definitely involves a lot of sacrifices, and if you can't make this teeny-tiny sacrifice for your pregnant wife\u2014well, that has got to change. For the next 18+ years, you're likely going to have to put aside your wants for your child's needs, so you'd better start now and get your practice in, because...it looks you need it.

However, this is unlikely to last the entire pg.  You are likely looking at weeks, not months.\n\nFor now, you can compromise.  Morning/all-day sickness sucks ass. She is not the ah because she doesn't want to puke every time you cook up a meal. C'mon.\n\nHowever, for now, stick with precooked meats or meats that don't need to be cooked.  Microwaving up a couple slices of precooked bacon from the box doesn't have much of a smell at all vs. cooking in raw in a pan. Same with sausages. Frozen meatballs, warmed up in sauce or broth, doesn't smell much, if at all. Frozen chicken breast strips.  Canned fish IS smelly, so that would be a no.

She said that we could eat vegetarian food/ vegan food for now. \n\nI'm not completely against the idea if eating vegetarian/ vegan food some times a week, but every day? That's too much to ask.

Vegetarian and vegan eating comes with so many delicious options -- and there are countless recipies out there that are delicious.  OP is so inconsiderate to his pregnant wife carrying their baby, and he also seems like he is ignorant about vegetarian/vegan foods.", "I think he's being hyperbolic intentionally to try and get more sympathy. I truly hope in this day and age people are aware that vegetarians eat more than lettuce.", "And that it\u2019s unlikely to last for the full duration. It\u2019ll most likely be for a couple more months", "oh my gooood. his poor wife :<", "No, he said he wasn't \"ready\" and she insisted.

He's being asked to temporarily not cook meat around his wife because it makes her violently ill. He can still have all dairy products, eggs, pre-cooked meat, and meat prepared outside of their apartment.\n\nIt's literal derangement to look at a situation that has nothing to do with veganism and drag veganism into it.", "Fair point.", "So does NAH mean \u201cNo asshole?\u201d If so I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nI was just saying HE is NTA, not that anybody else is (because duh the wife isn\u2019t).", "Are they afraid they\u2019re penises are gonna fall off if they don\u2019t eat meat or something?", "This is what most people voting NTA don't get.

But my husband made an effort to...not eat them near me.  What a sacrifice!", "Maybe this is the childfree side of me speaking, but do some people like OP really give zero fucking thoughts about what all is involved about having children?  Are people not in tune with themselves enough to sit down and *really* think about how demanding parenthood is?  I fully believe that parenthood is the hardest job in the world, and it shouldn't be a radical to say, \"Yeah, having kids is quite demanding, and therefore, its not for me.\"  All children deserve loving parents, but not every adult deserves to be a parent.   My god, I hope OP gets some deep therapy and learns to communicate better with his wife and learns to have some basic empathy, for the wife and the baby's sake.", "I'm trying to not let the childfree side of me take over my empathy, but I do agree with you here.  Having children is the hardest job in the world, and deserve to have a partner who is *100% willing* to take on the massive responsibilities involved with parenthood.  I don't understand people who are so adamant about having babies that they don't stop for a minute and think what all needs to be done *before* having children.  If you fail to plan, you plan to fail, as my dad says.  (My parents had me four years after they got married, they both were very enthusiastic about becoming parents, and they had a game plan/had children when it was the right time for them and got accustomed to married life.)", "Do you understand what a restaurant is? Or that pregnancy doesn\u2019t last forever?\n\nOh, and an edit because this is a real kicker- did you know that meat is typically only one part of an individuals diet? And that they typically consume more than just meat in a single day?", "\"Minimize your exposure to scents that make you violently ill while you're growing a human inside you\" actually does sound like legitimate medical advice. I think most OB-GYNs would view regular vomiting as not ideal for a pregnant person's health.", "Actually that is medical advice. Medical advice is not just medication. A plan of care for someone involves many things. Whether you want to follow said advice is a whole other issue.", "I am an obgyn, and I\u2019ve given this advice before.

Medical isn't just \"here, take this pill\"", "It\u2019s advice given by a doctor. Thats pretty much the definition of medical advice", "Do you work in the medical field?", "Surely advising to avoid the cause of the damaging symptom would be the first step over treating the symptom? It\u2019s advice on how to prevent a medical condition given by a doctor, how is that not medical advice?", "That\u2019s absurd. Medical care is so much more than medicine.   If all your primary care provider is doing is prescribing medication then you should find a new one. Your physician should be interviewing you about lifestyle choices that effect your health and wellness, and teaching you what changes can move you closer yo your goals. In this case OP\u2019s wife\u2019s health goal is to vomit less, and part of the advice was to avoid smells that increase vomiting.", "Yep! My first pregnancy I was still throwing up on the morning my son was born!", "Tangentially related, but I love the phrase \u201cexpanding a family\u201d. The term \u201cstarting a family\u201d rubs me the wrong way because it implies that it\u2019s not a family without children, erasing childfree folks and people with fertility issues. Expanding a family is so much more inclusive!", "Flipping heck. I mean imagine realising your partner and future co parent thinks like this. I hope he's just mindlessly posting on here and has a long hard think. \n\nReplace pregnancy morning sickness (usually only the first trimester unless you are really unlucky) with something else like chemo sickness.

If one wants to wait till their late in age to have kids they should tell their partner. Having a kid they don't want/ready for really puts a strain on the marriage.

The answer is yes, unfortunately.", "Vomiting is bad for anyone's health, doing it too often wrecks your esophagus. It's a well noted problem in people who purge", "Yes.

I\u2019m single but I don\u2019t consider myself to be without a family. I just don\u2019t have a partner or children.

Lol", ">I didn\u2019t want it anyway it\u2019s like his get out of parenting, free card\n\nIt sounds like he is a shit communicator and doesn't know how to express his needs or desires in a relationship.  I feel sorry that his wife has to put up with his sorry ass, and I especially feel bad for their child, whose father is already proving to be useless well before they are even born.  Hopefully OP can get some serious therapy and have some sense talked into him and needs to learn how to have basic human empathy toward his wife in her time of need.  So much for \"in sickness and in health!\"", "I have a lot of respect for folks who have children later in life, because they had children when they were *ready* to have children.  My parents are still together and my mom was almost 30 when she had me; my dad 36.  Mom always taught me to value singleness over being with a partner who is an asshole, and she and dad have had the most incredible marriage over the years.

What, did he just grunt when she said I want a baby? I don\u2019t mean to rant at you lol. This one\u2019s making me especially mad because I think it might be real.", "There is a terrible level of misinformation regarding that. It's more reversible than a woman getting sterilized. But it's not some walk in the park and reversals don't always work.\n\nYou also shouldn't be going in for *sterilization* with the thought that you can get it reversed later.  If a doctor got a wiff of that they'd refuse the procedure.", "Doctors recommend to *never* consider a vasectomy reversible, and to not get one if you think there's a chance you may want future kids.  It is absolutely not always reversible, and reversals are less successful the longer it's been since since the initial surgery.", "Well, this situation has nothing to do with that. OP's wife doesn't seem to have any \"belief\" about meat other than the smell of it cooking is temporarily making her vomit.", "Not to mention in many cases the nausea eases quite a bit by second trimester.
