{"id": 20513, "submission_id": "14i9fwh", "title": "AITA for inviting all of my classmates but one to our school reunion?", "selftext": "After much effort, I've finally managed to pull together enough of my old classmates to have a school reunion. I'd say class reunion, but our school only ever had 103 alumni, so it's not really necessary to do one for each class. Most of the alumni were fairly easy to reach as we've kept in close contact over the years. All but one girl that I'll call Bell who unsurprisingly ghosted us right after she graduated. \n\nOur school was...eccentric. It was designed for very specific types of students and had high expectations, and with that comes with some unusual attitudes and policies. One of their most unusual was against 'fraternization'. Making and having friends wasn't banned, per se, but interactions between students were closely monitored and had to be \"beneficial'. If they didn\u2019t view it as beneficial, there would be a disciplinary meeting. The consequences varied depending on what the circumstances were. Most of the time, it was just a warning about not 'becoming a distraction to each other' or enforced solo study time for a few weeks. The worst consequence was being put on probation, which was one step above being expelled and involved staying above a 3.0, not being allowed to have personal electronics after 8 pm (instead of 10), and losing off campus time for the entirety of the semester, but that only ever happened if it was extreme or involved someone of the opposite sex.\n\nMost of us liked not feeling social pressure, so I've only heard of a few times where there wasn't just a warning. The summer after sophomore year, one of our other classmates saw Bell hanging out with a male friend of hers. The rules technically applied both on and off campus, so when she reported it back, Bell ended up being put on probation for the entirety of fall semester.\n\nShe got sick and spent most of our senior year in and out of the hospital. I'm convinced she was only passed that last semester because they felt some level of sympathy. She turned down the standard offer for college help, and cut contact after. \n\nSome people have noticed that she's not on the list and are asking me about it. I don't want to invite her. The last time we spoke about a year after, she demanded to be left alone to \"live a normal life\". I want to respect her wishes to not be involved, but also, I don't want to deal with her. She made it clear that she was disgusted by all of us and the school, and now I'm supposed to bother her? They want me to try. I have found her social media, and judging from that, they would just judge her anyway. She way underachieved, but she has her perfectly average, normal life. She looks happy, and I hope she is. I just think the best thing is to leave her out of this. They say she's a graduate and needs to be invited.

Actually, I just moved away.\n\nI prefer being \"dead\" than attending my high school reunion. Maybe I'll change my mind in my 60s.\n\nEdit: I agree with you. I kept my BFF since Kindergarten. That was the important thing.", "I didn\u2019t know that. But, it\u2019s all irrelevant if you didn\u2019t eat your meat!", "'Pudding' over here, when not used generically for all dessert, is a hot steamed cake, like Christmas pudding. Served often with custard, which we also call custard, or creme anglais if we are being posh. \n\nWhat you call 'pudding' in America isn't common here at all but we have one main brand called angel delight (non brand versions are some form of either 'whipped dessert' or 'delight'.).", "This feels weirdly cult-y, too (no \"fraternization\" wtf). \n\nBut, I don't think looking for someone on SM is stalking. As long as it's just a simple google search for their name. Just a simple invite: \"Hey, Bell. This is ....... from school. We're having our reunion at ............. on ............ We'd love for you to attend.\" Not saying she'd have or want to go (from what's described, I wouldn't), but it's only right to extend the offer. Her decision from there.", "Christ, all of you sound brainwashed. She should never have gotten in trouble for hanging out with a boy, no one should have ever tattled (what a seriously stupid thing to do and childish) and yes x you should have extended the olive branch to the reunion. Either way, it\u2019s clearly you are very judgmental of her which is high school behavior, so it\u2019s fitting YOU are planning the reunion.\n\nYTA", "You didn't go to a school, you went to a cult indoctrination.", "But you said it was your friend who told on hers male friend? So why is she allowed to have a male friend and no one questioned that?", "A school cannot dictate a how students behave off property.", "You gotta eat your meat before you get that pudding!"]}
