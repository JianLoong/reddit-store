{"id": 20513, "submission_id": "14i9fwh", "title": "AITA for inviting all of my classmates but one to our school reunion?", "selftext": "After much effort, I've finally managed to pull together enough of my old classmates to have a school reunion. I'd say class reunion, but our school only ever had 103 alumni, so it's not really necessary to do one for each class. Most of the alumni were fairly easy to reach as we've kept in close contact over the years. All but one girl that I'll call Bell who unsurprisingly ghosted us right after she graduated. \n\nOur school was...eccentric. It was designed for very specific types of students and had high expectations, and with that comes with some unusual attitudes and policies. One of their most unusual was against 'fraternization'. Making and having friends wasn't banned, per se, but interactions between students were closely monitored and had to be \"beneficial'. If they didn\u2019t view it as beneficial, there would be a disciplinary meeting. The consequences varied depending on what the circumstances were. Most of the time, it was just a warning about not 'becoming a distraction to each other' or enforced solo study time for a few weeks. The worst consequence was being put on probation, which was one step above being expelled and involved staying above a 3.0, not being allowed to have personal electronics after 8 pm (instead of 10), and losing off campus time for the entirety of the semester, but that only ever happened if it was extreme or involved someone of the opposite sex.\n\nMost of us liked not feeling social pressure, so I've only heard of a few times where there wasn't just a warning. The summer after sophomore year, one of our other classmates saw Bell hanging out with a male friend of hers. The rules technically applied both on and off campus, so when she reported it back, Bell ended up being put on probation for the entirety of fall semester.\n\nShe got sick and spent most of our senior year in and out of the hospital. I'm convinced she was only passed that last semester because they felt some level of sympathy. She turned down the standard offer for college help, and cut contact after. \n\nSome people have noticed that she's not on the list and are asking me about it. I don't want to invite her. The last time we spoke about a year after, she demanded to be left alone to \"live a normal life\". I want to respect her wishes to not be involved, but also, I don't want to deal with her. She made it clear that she was disgusted by all of us and the school, and now I'm supposed to bother her? They want me to try. I have found her social media, and judging from that, they would just judge her anyway. She way underachieved, but she has her perfectly average, normal life. She looks happy, and I hope she is. I just think the best thing is to leave her out of this. They say she's a graduate and needs to be invited.

The extreme trauma from my childhood. The isolation because I was bullied has literally been used to argue it's not neurodivergence but that I wasn't socialised properly.\n\n\n\nShe probably feels like they all display traits, but for 30 years I was told those traits were PTSD related, so they do look pretty similar in some cases.", "Sounds like a bunch of rich kid bullies who probably bully actual neurodivergents", "Recipe for being in dangerous situations when you have any freedom at all.", "As someone who went to an all-girls school, it massively effed up my socialisation. Especially being non-binary and getting on better with men, I never had those opportunities which left me totally isolated. I'm still dealing with the consequences of that 20 years later and never did manage to be \"normal\". Or, in the words of OP, I way underachieved.", "Groupthink. Cast out the heretic!", "Oh she absolutely knows it and op has never been held accountable for anything ever.", "Idk people usually don't like being told to fuck off. Doesn't sound like OP personally did anything wrong to her, so why should she be the punching bag and be told to fuck off for her catharsis?", "I agree.", "Yeah. I feel like everybody saying OP is TA glossed over that part where Bell said she did not want anybody contacting her from the school and was disgusted by them. OP is an AH, but for the situation is NTA.", "I went to my schools (catholic high school up to 12 education year) 10 year reunion. Turns out it was a 'how much can you donate?' event, so I walked out. Not long after saw one of the Brothers of the Order that ran the school being Perp-walked into a courthouse. So there's that.", "Based on literally what?", "Scientology or Polygamy maybe?", "Might now want to go, but at least would appreciate an invite!", "tHe RuLeS aPpLiEd oFf CaMpUs\n\n\nShe was ratted on because you weirdos had no social skills to know that it actually didn\u2019t matter if she hung out with a boy outside of school.", "So she couldn\u2019t talk to people of the opposite sex ever? That is so bizarre. And definitely a cult-adjacent thing.", "Do you not see how fucked up it is for a school to control friendships full stop, let alone *outside school hours*? Get therapy.", "Yeah it sounded seriously culty to me", "Perhaps it\u2019s $cientology school.", "We have dessert and pudding. Custard is a type of pudding, but we do not call what you call pudding, custard. What you call pudding is not super common here. We do have it, the likes of angel delight are similar. But our puddings are very varied. Also, do you mean England? Or Great Britain? Or the United Kingdom?", "Some families refer to the dessert course *as pudding* but not all desserts are called pudding. It is an element of the meal when used this way, like saying starter (appetiser?) and main course.\n\n\n\nWe have Angel Delight and other pudding mixes, custard is custard, it's a sauce.", "I know I ordered \u201cchocolate pudding\u201d at the Riverside Pub on the Thames, and I was ecstatic when they brought us the most delicious chocolate cake ever. Yum\u2026", "Custard is ice cream!", "If OP would get their feelings so hurt over a declined invite that they would feel like a \"punching bag\" they probably wouldn't be organizing an event like this to begin with.", "Their own words. YTA", "Oh you have to go to one at least and make everyone think you faked your own death or something.", "It sounds like OP was the snitch.", "It's not a cult, it's a way to attain a mutually beneficial advancement to all students and the goals set for them. \n\n/s\n\n\ud83d\ude33", "I'm thinking classmate was the only one who managed to stay sane.\n\n134 alumni suggests that school isn't around anymore, and I wonder why...", "I was thinking this reads like a YA novel.

Don't ask me about the case\"", "Angel delight. That's pudding to them.", "Yeah, pudding is a very specific dessert in America that's probably sort of like a thick custard. Most of it is either premade or made from a mix and milk but homemade versions are usually a combination of butter, milk, eggs, and flavoring.\n\nI don't actually know the etymology of how the word pudding was adopted for the American thing from what it means in England, because there's no obvious link.", "I, the person you were originally responding to, and every other commenter. Sure.", "https://giphy.com/gifs/martellotech-PCU1qlnDuJfE0HZVbi", "I think I've watched too many cooking shows. I immediately started thinking how to make a savory custard to go with black pudding.", "Every other commenter purposefuly twisting op's words, yeah.", "Swap the sugar and vanilla out for cheese. Something hard and Italian, but not Pecorino, as it can go weird when it melts.", "Nothing to twist, they tell us everything, but go off.", "You went to the school? Because no one has twisted this person's words.", "Quote it to me. It's so obvious, i assumed you'd have shown me the part where op bullied her already.", "Show me. It's so obvious but I'm missing it, educate me. Copy paste."]}
