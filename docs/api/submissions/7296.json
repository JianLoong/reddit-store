Because it\u2019s a classical thing to do on bachelorette party\u2019s. \n\nI firmly denied changing my mind and told her that I will not attend if she stays with these plans.

Afraid you suggested planing it myself. Well I will talk with her in an hour (we are planned to meet up to talk about what\u2019s happening know) and if she refuses to change it I will plan it on my own and give the title of MoH to someone else.\n\nEdit2: Well talking to her was short. She says I am stuck up and shouldn\u2019t refuse how it\u2019s classic for a \u201clast free night\u201d, I told her she is no longer MoH and planned/will plan my bachelorette party on my own.", "created_utc": 1673691344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bl67c/aita_for_not_going_to_my_bachelorette_party_until/", "score": 651, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To me it would include:\n* Accepting yourself as an individual and not feeling you have to like or want the things other people want.\n*Allowing yourself to take up space - for example, expecting your own hen to be enjoyable for you.\n*Not being peer pressured into sexual activity you don't want\n*Holding firm to your boundaries even when it means uncomfortable discussions \n\nSo I do agree with your friends that you are at different maturity levels, I just disagree about who needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nI had the exact same boundaries and the luck that they were respected.

She doesn\u2019t mind alcohol but does was not keen on a typical hen do and would rather have no hen do than wearing stupid outfits and being embarrassing in a night club.\n\nI organised a day in London with a chocolate workshop with all of us making truffles and eating lots of chocolate and a nice meal with cocktails and she loved it and that\u2019s what it is about, make the bride happy!", "NTA at all. Those who are ignoring your boundaries want their kind of party and are disrespecting you. Don't be afraid to let those go. They are obviously not in your wedding out of any kindness toward you.
