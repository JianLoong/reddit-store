Because it\u2019s a classical thing to do on bachelorette party\u2019s. \n\nI firmly denied changing my mind and told her that I will not attend if she stays with these plans.

Afraid you suggested planing it myself. Well I will talk with her in an hour (we are planned to meet up to talk about what\u2019s happening know) and if she refuses to change it I will plan it on my own and give the title of MoH to someone else.\n\nEdit2: Well talking to her was short. She says I am stuck up and shouldn\u2019t refuse how it\u2019s classic for a \u201clast free night\u201d, I told her she is no longer MoH and planned/will plan my bachelorette party on my own.", "created_utc": 1673691344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bl67c/aita_for_not_going_to_my_bachelorette_party_until/", "score": 1205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those who are ignoring your boundaries want their kind of party and are disrespecting you. Don't be afraid to let those go. They are obviously not in your wedding out of any kindness toward you.

The closest was one where the bride\u2019s best friends - who were well known for being out-of-control partiers at that stage in their lives - had the bachelorette group do a bar tour (there was a part of our city that had a huge cluster of bars in like a 6 block length of a major street) which involved a *lot* of drinking, the bride and various members of the party dancing on the bar tops, some body shots (only on parts of the body which would be uncovered in a modest bikini), and that was it, the party came back to the bride & groom\u2019s place around 1am or so (I was there for a casual bachelor party), and the groom took care of his really drunk fianc\u00e9e, and we all went home. \n\n\nI\u2019m not saying that there\u2019s anything \u2018wrong\u2019 with those kinds of parties, just that they\u2019re not as common nor classical / traditional as the MoH was insisting; if anything, this was clearly the kind of party *she* wanted, and was using OP as a cover for it. \n\n\nGo and have the kind of party you want, and if MoH is hell-bent on hers, she can have it without you.", "NTA. Why should you have to suck it up when she planned things you told her specifically you didn\u2019t want. I\u2019m glad from your update that she\u2019s no longer your moh.", "NTA. If my fiance is kissing strangers the night before our wedding, there would be no wedding.", "\u201cgrow up\u2019\u201c and drink till you puke and kiss strangers. Sure, that sounds very mature./s\n\nNTA", "NTA.  It's OP's wedding and for the bachelorette, it's has to align with what she's comfortable with - not some 'classic tradition'.  OP was right to dump her MOH.", "NTA! This is ridiculous! It should be what you want to do. Not all bachelorette parties are wild and crazy. For mine, we spent the weekend at the beach. My MOH has a family member with a beach house so we stayed there, went to the beach, went to dinner, and hung out and talked. Didn't drink much either, just a few beers a day.\nEven my MOH when she got married we went zip lining and then stayed at a hotel nearby and just hung out. \nYou can have a chill and fun bachelorette party without all the crazy party stuff you see in movies. Do what you want to do. Your friends should respect that if they are your friends!", "NTA at all. \nFor my SIL\u2019s stagette, we hit up water slides all day, then went back to the Airbnb, ordered pizza, and fell asleep by 8:30 \ud83e\udd23 \n\nIt was a hot day. We had planned to grab dinner on a patio, but we all had too much sun. Wild times. 14/10 great stagette.", "NTA.  This party isn\u2019t being set up with you in mind, it\u2019s what they want to do.  I\u2019d cancel the whole thing and do a spa day, even if it\u2019s by myself.  A party for you shouldn\u2019t be something you have to grit your teeth through.  Why would you tolerate that from a so called friend?", "It is YOUR bachelorette party.  Not hers.  It sounds like she doesn't really know you.  NTA", "NTA. Its YOUR bachelorette party, they should plan something that YOU like or let you plan. No brainer. \nIf she cannot respect your (very reasonable) boundaries she has no place being your MOH", "NTA This is your wedding and your party, not her\u2019s. Read your edit and you\u2019re doing the right thing. Have fun at your party!", "NTA. Not wanting to get drunk and turning into a brainless zombie is perfectly ok.", "NTA. My bachelor party was a hike into the middle of nowhere and a bonfire with friends. Why would cheating be in the equation", "NTA you told her what you wanted for a bachelorette party and she didn\u2019t listen to your requests. she shouldn\u2019t expect you to go to your own bachelorette party when she completely ignores what you want and you don\u2019t deserve to have someone like her as maid of honour. honestly give someone else who is in agreement with you the role of maid of honour otherwise she may continue to ignore your requests for your own wedding and make this about her.", "NTA. My bachelorette party was having Chinese buffet. That was it. I have never had any interest in drinking and just wanted something low key.", "NTA. My MOH planned a haunted house night and themed it after Harry Potter because I am obsessed with it. OBSESSED \ud83d\ude02 we did drink but that was our choice and no one was forced, it was only if you wanted too. It was so much fun and definitely didn't include strippers or kissing random strangers. Also, would kissing random people kind of defeat the purpose of planning the rest of your life with one person? Like I would not have been okay with my husband doing that at his bachelor party and I know he wouldn't have been okay with me doing it. It's so disrespectful to the relationship youre about to solidfy as a marriage.", "NTA \n\nThis is the one occasion that should be all about YOU and your MOH basically planned this party around everything you said you didn't want. I would just make your own plans and invite everyone you want there since you can't trust her to honor your wishes.\n\nKissing strangers is not normal at all and it is clear that in her planning, she expects that you will be black out drunk by the time it is time to play this \"game\". This is disrespectful to your fiance at best. When I told my husband about this he said it sounds like she is trying to make sure you don't get married.", "NTA, pick a new MOH from your more supportive friends. The one you have now doesn\u2019t care what you want, it\u2019s all about her", "NTA. And an escape room bachelorette party sounds way better than getting a bride wasted and humiliating her.", "NTA\n\nWow, MOH didn't honor your request.  Your requests are reasonable and valid for your own reasons.  She has no regard for your feelings and went ahead with those \"fun filled\" night that you guys may end up paying the cost of cleaning up and whatnots.  So plan your own party.  Glad you kicked MOH out.  Calling you a stuck up is no way to retain the friendship.  She showed her true colors.  Not a true friend.  Congrats and Good Luck on your wedding.", "NTA. When I got married I said no strip club. We went to the Renaissance Fair and had a blast.", "NTA", "She planned a night SHE would enjoy and not you. Boot her and then replan it yourself with the friends that were supportive.\n\nThe others can go bar crawling and making out with strangers on their one time.\n\nNTA.", "NTA not every bachelorette needs to be getting blind drunk, I planned to go to a theme park for mine (didn't end up having one as was very pregnant for my wedding lol.  You had some good ideas but MOH just wanted to do her thing.", "NTA, she wanted you to cheat on your husband lol", "NTA. My bachelorette party was a nice dinner out with friends, then back to my house for wine, cake, and gifts. It was exactly what I wanted. You should have exactly what you want (as long as it doesn\u2019t require your guests to pay a bunch of money or do something that makes them uncomfortable).", "I\u2019m sorry- someone is telling YOU what you can and cannot do for YOUR bachelorette party, and then making you feel like a horrible person for not wanting to do what you explicitly said you wouldn\u2019t do? what on earth did she think would happen? \n\nDrop the MoH title and have a get together you will actually enjoy, nobody should be forced into things they\u2019re that uncomfortable doing.\nHard NTA.", "NTA. As your MoH, she should have planned a party for YOU. It sounds like she planned this party for herself.", "It sounds to me like she is trying to cram her idea of fun down your throat OP.\n\nMy bachelorette party was 6 girls at a Chinese restaurant and then hanging out afterwards.it was nice and \n\nClassic just means other people have done it in the past - not that it should appeal to you or that you should partake.", "NTA wow you had to kick her out of the wedding because she refused to respect your wishes. Unreal.", "NTA", "NTA. I can\u2019t drink (makes me sick, even in tiny quantities) and I didn\u2019t want a bachelorette party where I was babysitting other drunks. I wanted to relax. My MOH planned a spa day with facials, mani/pedis, and a lovely lunch at an Italian restaurant. I felt like my desires were heard and honoured, and it is still one of my favourite memories. Plan the day you want \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. \n\nMoH is supposed to know you and what you want.\n\nMy Bachelorette was a guided group meditation with my ladies, followed by snacks at my house where we hired 2 massage thetapists to set up and give 10 minute massages to anyone who wanted them during the evening. 100% relaxing,  0%cheating", "NTA you may need a different maid of honor.  She is it respecting your boundaries.  Doesn\u2019t even sound like a friend I would want at my wedding in any fashion", "NTA- the party is for you and thus should be something you enjoy.", "NTA\n\nI'm reminded of a story I heard recently, of an engaged couple that knew each other since childhood. They agreed to, among other things, no strip clubs in their bachelor/bachelorette parties. Come night of, bride to be ended up caving to a friend's peer pressure and ended up not only going to a strip club, but blowing one of the strippers and thus cheating on her fiance. It destroyed their relationship completely. So good on you for sticking to your guns, and this \"friend\" can go pound sand.", "NTA.  \n\nI do tend to be more socially conservative than some of my friends, and when I was younger I hated it when they tried to put me in situations they know I wasn't going to like - to broaden my horizons, or push my boundaries, or whatever. I'm comfortable with what I'm comfortable with.  \n\nThis is your event, and quite frankly is going to be the most of your friends you'll have together in one place until your funeral. You get to choose for it to be fun.  \n\nI don't know if there's a category for MoHzilla like there is for Bridezilla, but this seems to fall into it.", "NTA. You now know that 4 people aren\u2019t actually your friends.", "nta", "That \u201cgrow up\u201d comment made my head spin. I\u2019m no spring chicken, and I don\u2019t drink (not religious or addition issues, just don\u2019t care to). If betting blacked out at clubs and kissing randos before getting married is what grown ups do, count me tf out. \n\nOP is NTA and maybe should reconsider the friends who are pushing her boundaries so disrespectfully. :(", "NTA.  I'm having a man of honor and he and I are planning my bach together", "The MOH's plans may be classic, but they're not classy.", "That's why I had my bachelor party at an arcade with lots of classic games.", "Agreed! I have attended a \u201cboring\u201d bachelorette party (as the former MOH from this story would like to call it. We did an escaperoom, other activities and had a great dinner with both the bachelorette party and bachelor party guests (everyone was friends with each other since they were a couple for 10+ years). It was a blast. \n\nOnly people who are boring without alcohol will not want to attent a party without alcohol.", "And getting upset when she didn\u2019t change her mind! Not a true friend at all.", "lovely idea!", "Exactly! Don't do anything during the bachelor/bachelorette party that your relationship doesn't allow for during any other random nights out. It's your last time being legally single, but you're not *single*.\n\nAnd when a party is a celebration for a particular individual in the group, it should center around what that individual will enjoy!", "Exactly.  Traditions are autopilots for the unimaginative, the lazy, and the not very bright.", "Wtf multiple grown men sat around and watched porn based on their professions not for the groom but the best man?\n\nSounds like the best man took the groom for a ride tbh (for clarification I mean the bad kind)", "Found the ex-maid of honor", "It\u2019s wild to me how kissing is cheating, unless it\u2019s during a bachelorette party where you kiss strangers? Apparently that\u2019s not cheating to a lot of people? It\u2019s still cheating in my book.", "The \"last night of freedom\" crowd definitely needs to just be single. Being married isn't like being in captivity, my husband is my best friend. I feel sorry for all these people thinking they're losing freedom with marriage. A good partner should make you feel more free and not less", "Ugh, strip clubs and anything \"Chippendales\" adjacent is just cringey and awful to me. Not sexy, not fun.", "I totally agree. Also, who wants a MoH who openly calls you \u201cstuck up\u201d. She\u2019s not a friend. \n\nNTA", "My wife and I hosted a board games night with some close friends.", "Ewwww", "Selling *condoms*?!? That\u2019s just wrong, given the implications on the seller\u2019s part.", "That\u2019s great, they give their husbands to be herpes as a wedding gift!", "I planned my sister's Bachelorette party last year.  I found out what she wanted to do,  got input from her friends about best restaurants to go to before hand and just set everything up and made sure there was enough money to make sure everything went smoothly.  It's not that hard.", "Right? I\u2019m not married so maybe I\u2019m naive, but I\u2019ve always pictured getting married as being with your best friend and someone that you deeply love. You\u2019d have to hold me back from signing up for that! I cannot picture the mindset of thinking that I was no longer \u201cfree\u201d, and that being married is somehow this major negative on life", "Oh me to as once the trust has gone its gone for good.", "The whole idea of \"this is your last night of freedom\" seems bizarre and antiquated.\n\nIf you're getting married, shouldn't you already be in a committed relationship? And if visiting strippers is something that parties in the relationship are uncomfortable with, why is a bucks/hens night any different?\n\nLast night of freedom? No one is forcing you to get married. If you feel your freedom will be restricted by marriage, perhaps marriage isn't for you.\n\nI mean, by all means have a night out with your friends before you get married, but in a healthy marriage going out with your friends sometimes should be okay too... As it was in the committed relationship you hopefully were in before you got married. A party is okay, I just don't get the whole \"last night of freedom\" thing.", "Agreed. NTA. Sounds like her \"friend\" is just looking for an excuse to get drunk and act crazy, which she can do on her own time. OP definitely needs a new maid of honor.", "Former MoH is using this as an excuse to plan what she wants, having outright ignored what the actual bride to be wants. No surprise she lashed out when called out because she didn't get what she wanted.", "You need to delete the space on your first spoiler tag for it to work", "Think of it as a holdover from a time with more political/arranged marriages - where you probably only met your bride to be a couple times and had chaperones to keep you at a good distance", "It's YOUR bachelorette and YOU have to enjoy it. If you don't, it's not a party for you, but for them.NAT", "Or even better, herpes, the gift that keeps on giving.", "Yep, and you didn't even have a relationship before you were married - you barely knew them."]}
