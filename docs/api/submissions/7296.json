Because it\u2019s a classical thing to do on bachelorette party\u2019s. \n\nI firmly denied changing my mind and told her that I will not attend if she stays with these plans.

Afraid you suggested planing it myself. Well I will talk with her in an hour (we are planned to meet up to talk about what\u2019s happening know) and if she refuses to change it I will plan it on my own and give the title of MoH to someone else.\n\nEdit2: Well talking to her was short. She says I am stuck up and shouldn\u2019t refuse how it\u2019s classic for a \u201clast free night\u201d, I told her she is no longer MoH and planned/will plan my bachelorette party on my own.", "created_utc": 1673691344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bl67c/aita_for_not_going_to_my_bachelorette_party_until/", "score": 2827, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those who are ignoring your boundaries want their kind of party and are disrespecting you. Don't be afraid to let those go. They are obviously not in your wedding out of any kindness toward you.

The closest was one where the bride\u2019s best friends - who were well known for being out-of-control partiers at that stage in their lives - had the bachelorette group do a bar tour (there was a part of our city that had a huge cluster of bars in like a 6 block length of a major street) which involved a *lot* of drinking, the bride and various members of the party dancing on the bar tops, some body shots (only on parts of the body which would be uncovered in a modest bikini), and that was it, the party came back to the bride & groom\u2019s place around 1am or so (I was there for a casual bachelor party), and the groom took care of his really drunk fianc\u00e9e, and we all went home. \n\n\nI\u2019m not saying that there\u2019s anything \u2018wrong\u2019 with those kinds of parties, just that they\u2019re not as common nor classical / traditional as the MoH was insisting; if anything, this was clearly the kind of party *she* wanted, and was using OP as a cover for it. \n\n\nGo and have the kind of party you want, and if MoH is hell-bent on hers, she can have it without you.", "NTA.

I'd like to know how it started, too!  But I do remember talking about my grandmother's collection of glass with him. He kept coming back to our table throughout the night during breaks, saying we didn't make grabs at him.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure how someone can be upset with YOU about not wanting things at a party designed for YOU. Even if it was something simple like not going to a certain place for dinner, it\u2019s YOUR party. You get the last say. For her to refuse just shows she cares more about her own fun rather than your wants snd likes. I\u2019m sorry that happened", "NTA\n\nGood friends would *never* do this to you.\n\nWhen it was my turn I was very clear that I didn\u2019t want anything to do with strippers or penises or random strangers, but I didn\u2019t need to say all that because my bridesmaids knew me very well and wanted me to enjoy myself rather than cringe and hate it. My bridesmaids planned two amazing parties for me - one was an afternoon tea suitable for the older ladies in the family to attend, and another was hiring out a house in the middle of nowhere and playing board games and enjoying good food with my girl friends!", "NTA, it sounds like the maid of honor wants an excuse to have a crazy night under the guize of doing this for my friend.  You read way too many stories about the wedding party got too drunk, strippers were involved, some sort of cheating happened and the a today I fucked up post later.\n\nI've only thrown 1 bachelor party.  On the one I planned, I was trying to crowd source the ideas and all I got was let's get drunk and go get a cabin and drink more, probably strippers.  Sat the groom down and asked what he wanted, what was cool and off limits.\n\nWe basically took him out to dinner and then ended up having a house party, a few bottles, boardgames, movies and videogames.  Very tame, but nobody regretted it the next day either.", "Kudos to you OP for standing up for what you want. I let my \"friends\" plan mine and was miserable, my main memory of my bachelorette was sitting on the porch to get away from the drunk shenanigans inside. NTA", "NTA and so glad you fired her as MOH. She just wanted her idea of a good time. Even if she actually, truly believed that you just don't know what you will actually like or that her idea of a bachelorette party is the only correct kind of party, she is still TA for persisting in that arrogant  way of thinking.\n\nDon't know if those other 3 supporters of her will double down; if they do, they can go bye-bye, too. People who can't understand that doing something for a person means actually doing what that person values and wants. Forcing a personal preference on someone \"as a gift\" is a pretty rotten gift.\n\nFrankly, what you would like sounds great!", "NTA, make no mistake it's \\*your\\* party, not anybody else's. That's not to say you are a party dictator, but your friends don't get to make it all about them and just drag you along.", "NTA!  \nNTA!  \nI think you are fine! I am really tired of seeing people try to force a hard drinking/hard partying/licentious situation down the throat of any bride or groom who wants their own idea of a fun bachelor/ette party because \"tradition.\"  A friend should welcome a chance to relax before a busy day like the wedding will be. Your wishes for your bachelorette are not selfish, they are not stuck up, and they are certainly not ungrateful.", "NTA, and well done for firing her. She was steamrollering your requests for YOUR night and making it one you would not have enjoyed. \nGood luck, enjoy yourself, and happy wedding :)", "NTA. If I was getting married and my fiance went to her Bachelorette party with the intention of kissing strangers, I would end it.", "NTA I didn't want these things either. For my Bachelorette, we rented a hot tub boat in Seattle, had a nice dinner, and then went to a 90s dance party at a bar where we had a couple drinks, and then we got those e-scooters and scooted around town. It was super fun and I had a great time with my best friends. The whole trope of how you're 'supposed' to do a Bachelorette is lame as hell imo", "Nta, good on you for sticking up for your standards. Strippers are a form of cheating in my book, Having one kinda defeats the purpose of a marriage.", "Ugh. I had my 18th birthday destroyed like this. Had planned a quiet night with friends but they dragged me out on the town where they promptly ditched me for alcohol (I don\u2019t drink) and some cute guys they found. I ended up walking home alone. They came back drunk the next morning. Don\u2019t let them force you into this. I would also reconsider inviting the three friends that may actively try to ruin it. Best of luck. NTA", "NTA- this is your bachelorette weekend and should be what you want and your friends should be 100% on board with it.  This weekend is not for them.  It\u2019s for you. Period.", "Nta. Those three friends and the MoH just want an excuse to party. They can have that on another weekend.", "I\u2019m about to turn 40 so I have several friends who have been married over the years. I don\u2019t know any of them who had bachelorette parties like this one.\n\nWhen I was MOH for my best friend\u2019s wedding we went to a comedy club and had drinks (like 2-3 each) because that\u2019s what she wanted to do. I didn\u2019t force her to do things she didn\u2019t want to because it\u2019s her wedding!! Your friend is so inconsiderate and rude.\n\nNTA", "She isn\u2019t planning your bachelorette party, she is planning hers. You were right to refuse her. Frankly, I\u2019d rather do your party, if given the option. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, OP.  So you're not grateful for not wanting to do something you don't want to do?  Your MOH is planning HER bachelorette but using you as the reason.  Good on you for not caving to her pressure.", "Yeah, I wouldn't be grateful for someone attempting to force unwanted activities on me that I'd already explicitly refused. Ungrateful for her not behaving like a friend. Embrace that shit.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nALSO LOL AT YOUR EDIT. I bet she didn't see that coming. Better to lose these kinds of people from your life now rather than have them be a part of the wedding. Keep your wits OP! Passwords/emergency contacts for vendors should be changed if she was part of it.", "Strippers and binge drinking are classical? NTA.", "Excellent edit!! Good for you. She disrespected your boundaries in a big way. I\u2019m glad you stuck up for yourself! She\u2019s no friend of yours!", "Nta for not wanting to cheat on your future husband while your friends get black out drunk.", "My bachelorette party included a cooking class, museums, and yoga. It was a great weekend! I would never kiss a stranger, and I wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with people who were binge drinking. NTA", "Care to explain why?", "so people aren't allowed to have fun because others are suffering? What a strange outlook on life. Let people enjoy their lifestyles and personal choices.", "Exactly. Sounds like MoH was planning a night of blackmail material/ potential sabotage of OP's relationship, not a night of fun. Just mean-spirited.", "https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bl67c/aita_for_not_going_to_my_bachelorette_party_until/j4b0t1a/", "https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bl67c/aita_for_not_going_to_my_bachelorette_party_until/j4b0t1a/", "Seems like you were the night\u2019s highlight for him. Refreshingly wholesome", "Annoyed my friends to no end. They were looking forward to seeing me mortified with embarrassment.  I'm afraid the stripper and I spoiled their plans.", "NTA", "NTA it is YOUR bachelorette party. YOU are the one that ultimately gets to decide what does and does not happen at it. If they want to go get falling down drunk, fine. They can do that. Just not at your bachelorette party.\n\nIf they can't respect that, somebody else should be planning your party.", "As a fellow non-drinker, I'm right behind you on this. I'm sorry it had to end with your 'friend' being so obstinant but better now than closer to the wedding. Hope the actual day is wonderful.", "NTA she has arranged a party for her self not for you", "I've never ever gone to a bachelorette party that has games that involved kissing other people. That's pretty disrespectful to your partner. For bachelorette parties, I have gone to a paint party. I have gone to a fancy dinner and then dancing. I've done a couple mixed/combination parties. I've gone to a piano bar. \n\nI think I would have a lot more fun doing an escape room and a nice meal than your former MoH's plan.", "NTA! She should want to give you the kind of party you want. You\u2019re not being stuck up. Stuck up would insisting on bougie places and making everyone spent a ton of money. That\u2019s not what you did. You set boundaries regarding alcohol, nudity, and your own body. That\u2019s completely fine. Why would she want to give you a party she knows already you won\u2019t like? I\u2019ll never understand that type of thinking. I\u2019ve planned many a shower and bachelorette party and half the fun is using what you know your friend likes to make it great for them.\nEdit: typo", "OP, Great edits- glad to hear you won't be bullied into this.  It isn't stuck up to want a party that you like.   It is so messed up that your wedding attendants are peer-pressuring you like they were back in middle school.", "NTA. The bachelorette should be about what the BRIDE wants, not what the MOH wants. Your MOH and the 3 friends who want the drunken party can do that . You and the rest of your friends can do what you want. And maybe reconsider the MOH honor if she\u2019s that tone deaf to your wishes?", "I wanted bowling and the beach for my bachelorette party (also not a drinker/bar hopping kinda gal) so my MOH planned a trip to the beach and we went bowling. Nothing wrong with just wanting a fun trip with some friends without \"typical\" bachelorette activities.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA. \"Last free night\"? If I found out that my fianc\u00e9e had been sticking her tongue down stranger's throats in the days / weeks leading up to our wedding, a wedding would no longer be happening.", "NTA doesn't she realize in this day and age you can get arrested for touching someone without their permission, let alone kissing?!? If someone really wants to push it, they could claim assault.", "NTA. It is after all a party for you, so of course your feelings should be taken into consideration. This \"friend\" decided to ignore all that and planned the sort of party she wanted for herself.", "NTA good for you to stick up for what you believe", "NTA. I had the exact same opinion for mine, and I knew both sisters would do everything in their power to force me to do all those things. My bff MOH was a warrior and stood up against them and I cannot thank her enough. The audacity of people trying to force you to do any of those things. Plan your own to be safe and whoever doesn\u2019t like it can stay home.", "NTA.\n\nLook, what is right for you is what is right for you.  Bachelor and bachelorette parties among my friends have ranged from \"chill and play board games, have a scotch tasting, and delicious food\", to literal orgies (thrown by the couple jointly - no deception or cheating.)\n\nNow, there are quite a few people who would go to the first one and not the second, and that's totally fine.  But they are both completely fine ways to go about things.  Some people are Apolonian and like quieter pleasures, and some people are more Dyonesian and like things involving more sex, drugs, alcohol, and the like.\n\nBoth are perfectly fine things to enjoy so long as you don't harm anyone including yourself and bystanders and don't put anyone in a situation they don't want to be in.\n\nThrowing the.first kind of party for people who would prefer the second would be seen as a bit disappointing, maybe.  But throwing the second kind for the first people would be so far beyond the pale that adjectives do no exist for it.  If a person likes that second kind of party, or even the much milder version your ex-MoH wanted, they can throw it for themselves and leave you out of it.\n\nAlso... don't kiss strangers during a pandemic m'kay?\n\nNTA", "Also, even if one *does* like kissing strangers... COVID.  No.", "I'd rather have a rip roaring silly night of a crazed D&D party than go to a strip club or kiss strangers...", "Oooh, that's a great idea! I could see doing a pinball-themed bachelorette myself. \n\nExcept...my fianc\u00e9 loves pinball, too. Can he come to my bachelorette? LOL.", "Yes, this! I've played the field and had a lot of fun, but now I am engaged to the best human being I know and I feel free and secure at the same time. It's wonderful! If I do have a bachelorette party it will simply be an excuse to have an extravagant girls' night, not an excuse to go do things I'm not \"allowed\" to do when married. I have zero desire to do anything that wouldn't be okay with my fianc\u00e9.", "Exaxtly! I find it so disrespectful to treat the bachelor/Bachelorette parties like its the last night you'll ever enjoy yourself again/anything goes... I've always thought grooms who do that, and most often make irredeemable choices under the influence of alcohol and bad friends were disgusting and I don't think brides should do it either.", "There is no sex in the champagne room", "this is fantastic!  It sounds like so much fun"]}
