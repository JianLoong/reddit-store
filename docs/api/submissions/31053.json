We live in a small house and our space is very limited. Our daughter lexi was MIL's only grandchild until our littlest jax was born. MIL has always gotten Lexi tons of gifts even though she was asked not to, it wasn't horrible when lexi was an only child. Recently I have gone through lexi's toys and donated 3 large trash bags, still leaving two large totes, a hammock full of stuffed animals, a large stand of arts & crafts, multiple sets of Legos and a bookshelf full of books. After  failing to get her to stop in the past we gave it another try but actually gave some solutions this time. So two months ago my husband and I sat down and ask MIL to stop buying so much, we suggested either putting the money she would spend in a savings or only buy with the intention of putting it up for Christmas. This was very hard for me to do but I've been working on putting up boundaries with everyone in my life. Consistently for the past few months she has brought multiple gifts every week for Lexi, both my husband and I asked her to stop on many different occasions. Last week she told me she had something for lexi and I requested MIL put it up for Christmas. MIL got noticeably mad and said \"I really don't want to but I guess I will.\" MIL mentioned multiple times before telling us about every gift that she know we've ask her to stop but she really wanted to get this for Lexi. I went to my mom to vent explaining everything that happened, my mom defended MIL.... My mom trying to give me \"solutions that would make everyone happy\" and telling me to \"pick my battles\". My mom suggested to just let lexi throw something old away in place of the new items, I throw old things away behind lexi back or ignore it. I refuse to, this is effecting my mental health, my house being over ran with these clothes and toys.  I told my mom that I would give MIL the choice to take it back or I would throw it in the garbage infront of her.

However, if you went on to throw the brand new gift she gave in the rubbish then it would make you an asshole. You could just donate it, save it for Christmas, drop it back at MIL's House or ask MIL for the receipt so you could return it and get the money for your daughter.", "NTA. I think throwing it away in front of her will get the point across. It sounds like you have tried to handle it in better ways, but MIL isn't taking it seriously. Everyone suggesting to donate the gifts is sweet, but it would be abnoxious to have to keep running to drop them off, and it would be inconvenient to have to do this over and over. My only suggestion is to have your husband warn her one last time to reduce the presents or he will throw them away. He needs to throw it away in front of her if she continues (I think you should get it out of the trash after she leaves and donate it).", "NTA for wanting your MIL to stop.

You don't need to go to that extreme or waste good items.\n\nFirst, your husband should be dealing with it. Ask him to take over the battle and/or make a decision on what to do.

Or,:\n\n\\-  let the gifts pile up then re-gift for when Lexi is invited to birthday parties, give at Xmas,\n\n\\- sell the new stuff on Facebook, try to return to stores\n\n\\- tell your MIL that for every gift she brings, she has to take something home from the pile.\n\nI'd go for sell/return, then put that $ into a savings for your kids", "NTA for wanting to make a point by throwing the items away.

Instead, they put $5000 into investments on each birthday and both of my sons graduated from a private liberal arts college with no debt.

When adults put thought into a Christmas gift, throwing it out is an act of pure hostility. \n\nBut that is not what OP is talking about. Her MIL is bringing in so many toys that OP had three trash bags full of them with more to go. That's not her MIL being thoughtful. My love language is gifts, but that doesn't mean I get to impose it on others.

It is not ideal to throw things away, absolutely, but OP has tried to communicate, it is time for some consequences! My idea would be that she has a clean trash bin that she throws all gifts into as soon as MIL brings them in the house, but it is a donation bin that her DH needs to deal with.", "Ok but did your MIL tell you over and over again that she doesn\u2019t want your gifts (even if you put a lot of thought into them) and did you ignore that again and again and just brought them multiple times a week?
