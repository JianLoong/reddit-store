Why should things chamge for her. A baby would lock in (cough **trap** cough) you and you would see you money disappear along with any time with your child.\n\nYou really need to sit down and have a serious heart to heart in depth conversation with her because it doesn't sound like you both are on the same page, or even on the same continent.\n\nWhy should you be the only one contributing anything to this relationship?", "NTA.  As a woman, I am offended by your wife's behavior.  Marriage (or any relationship) should be 50/50.  You don't make that much more than she does, so a 50/50 split would be fair.

Of course you should pay 50/50 when you earn about the same (and split chores at home evenly too).\nBeing a SAHM also isn't a realistic option for many families.

I come from a family where lots of the women choose to stop working once they stop having children, so they are \"traditional\" in that sense. But they always covered their share of expenses before they stopped working, and it had always been agreed upon well in advance.\n\nYour wife is taking advantage of you. End of story. The whole \"I'm a woman I shouldn't pay my way\" is complete and utter BS. You need to reconsider this marriage. And whatever you do, do not bring kids into this situation.", "You should discuss where both of you see your relationship going, and if she can only see you supporting her, then there isn't really an ultimatum, because they don't work, they just prolong the break up. The only way to to contact really is if she is willing to continue working and split the finances equally.", "Ultimatums are dumb and dramatic and they didn\u2019t work. Just get out.", "NTA at all. She\u2019s already gone back on an agreement once, what makes you think she wouldn\u2019t again? Don\u2019t be foolish. She\u2019s already suckered you into paying for her school from the very beginning, you got married after dating for a year. After been locked into marriage she decides she isn\u2019t going to pay anything towards your mutual expenses. Do you not see a pattern? She\u2019s been taking advance of you from the jump and you\u2019ve been going right along with it. Sure, have a discussion with her to hear her views on the path she wants for your combined future. If it differs from yours in major ways then you have your answers. Relationships are about communication and compromise but major fundamental differences can\u2019t be compromised or the other partner ends up miserable and resentful. Or worse, one partner may scheme to have their way only to leave the other person used, overextended and mentally distressed. IF her future goals and wants align with yours (and you can trust her word) then you should seek counselling so you guy can move forward. It also wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to jointly see a financial advisor, especially because you have paid the lions share and she may now be in a position where she does not fully grasp money management. But as they say, love is blind and the quickest road to divorce is regarding money.", "You need more than an agreement, you have to back track and do the work you should have done in pre-marital counseling.   You have never been on the same financial page and you've been living as though she would suddenly see the light  Now you are surprised to realize that she was never intending to be part of a team.\n\nYou and your wife need both a financial planning course (not an advisor to tell you what to do) and probably some couples counseling as well.   I'd start with the first (something like Financial Peace University) because you may discover that there's no couple to counsel.", "Unfortunately some girls just feel a sense of entitlement, in this day and age you shouldn't need to try to come up with a way to convince her, it's the norm. I hope she starts to see that you're a team tackling life together and stops treating you like you're there to bank roll her having fun and saving while you live pay cheque to pay cheque to fund that lifestyle. If she's okay with that, then that's not love, she should want you to have nice things and savings too. Good luck with it.", "Listen to your gut. Do not combine finances in your current situation, you are young and that\u2019s why you should NOT. You and your wife need to learn to work together, develop financial literacy and solid, mutually agreed on habits- even then always have a few things that are yours only.

I don\u2019t know how to go about having her pay because I think she knows I care about my credit.", "I have and I\u2019m close to giving an ultimatum to at least comprise that she still works if we have a child.", "I\u2019ll think about it. I have slowed down on the bedroom activity.", "Interesting point for sure because that\u2019s a factor I did not consider.", "I\u2019ll come up with a way to convey my points to her.", "It hurts to see your wife might have married you so young for financial reasons (husband would pay for everything like school, while just bf may not), but you are still young to be able to restart. Even without a child, she probably tries to get money from you as much as possible (she probably says she owns 50% of house), but sounds like you are hardworking responsible person who can still restart.", "They don\u2019t have to be dramatic though", "Agreed thank you", "So ask her to put some in her name. The reason doesn\u2019t even have to be about her financial contribution directly. \nSome options: \n- you want to *help her* build more credit for herself. If you both have good credit it can improve financial options for both individuals and as a couple. \n\n- in some areas you get rebates or tax deductions for certain utilities but each person has a max. Often these can be split between spouses regardless of who pays but I\u2019m guessing she isn\u2019t the one doing the taxes. \n\n- you\u2019re a bit mentally overwhelmed being responsible for all the bills in the new house and it would be great if you split the responsibility of keeping track. \n\n- as it\u2019s her house too you want to make sure she\u2019s involved in the responsibilities in case something happens to you. (My friend teaches a financial management course for windows, it\u2019s alarming how overwhelmed they are because they were never involved- it\u2019s so much added stress to a sad situation and most of them run into big problems simply because they didn\u2019t know what/when/who to pay) \n\nIt doesn\u2019t just have to be about her paying although that is a perfectly legitimate reason.", "If she refuses to take any bills, and won't pay for any under your name \"because he cares about his credit so he'll pay it anyway\" how exactly is she being a partner? You're doing everything yourself!\n\nNow I do actually think SAHM is a full time job that shouldn't be disparaged.

You complicate your relationship and your life so much once you have a child.", "She is not a fair or good person.  She is selfish and rude. Absolutely do not have kids with her.  You are going to have an awful life on this path.", "Do you have any idea how expensive children are? Whatever you think it is I promise it\u2019s 5-10 times more expensive as the years go by. You need some condoms - keep them hidden! - because you two are so far from ready to have children.", "You realize you can't trust her word on this right?

Once you have a child, it's not going to matter what you want. She could just quit her job. Then what? It's either you support the family or divorce. The best case scenario is you get 50/50 and neither pays support. \n\nIs that best case what you want for your kid?\n\nAlso, if she has quit her job to take care of the kid you could end up divorced and paying for her to mostly stay home to take care of the kid anyway.\n\n\nYou already know that she doesn't view this as a partnership so I'm not sure why you think you have any leverage over whether she is a sahm , she's going to do what she wants anyway and you can't do anything about it once there is a child in the mix", "Do not have a child with this untrustworthy woman", "You need to resolve it.

Lots of people wait until after. Is this really the person you wasn't start a family with?", "Financial abuse.", "NTA. And for your sake, don't have a kid. What was the point of her spending all that time and money going to nursing school if she's not going to work?? Stop asking her to contribute more, and TELL her that, going forward, you will be contributing no more than 50% of the monthly expenses. If she wants to keep the lights on then she can be an adult and contribute her fair share. \"A woman shouldn't have to???\" Fucking bullshit. She is a grown ass adult, *not* your child whom you must support financially. Idk if I'd go so far as to let the utilities get shut off - depends on whose name they're in and how good your credit is - but maybe manually cut off the water or electric for a few days so she can see what happens when bills don't get paid", "I have a friend whose wife worked before she had their daughter. They moved overseas and while she could absolutely have gotten a job and got their daughter into daycare, she categorically refuses to work again. She also expects him home promptly after his work is done so he can cook, watch the daughter, and clean. She also wants to work on another child. Not to mention she gets very irrate when he makes purchases for himself and she tries to control their money (example being buying a bicycle or gym equipment). \n\nI say all this to say, you need to completely rethink this union. My friend loves his daughter but is going insane because his wife is driving him there. Sounds like your wife has been absolutely financially abusing your relationship, and probably has been saving just for the off chance that you wise up and call it quits. Baby is a trap to keep you in the relationship. Don't have sex, if she does apperate a pregnancy, get a paternity test, and have a come to Jesus meeting to share the expenses evenly if you want to continue the marriage for some reason.", "NTA, this is not a marriage she is a kept woman.  You pay her way for most things, and she is saving her money for God knows what.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m having a hard time with this one because it\u2019s EXTREMELY dis aligned with my personal values. I find it DISGUSTING that she expects you to pay for all the bills while she is working and does\u2026 what exactly with all the money? Spend it all on herself on crap? What? A marriage is a partnership. I consider it abusive she had you pay for all the schooling on top of that.\n\nHowever, you aren\u2019t me, so I\u2019m trying to step back here. The current situation of her working but you paying is the worst case scenario. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tenable. Let me ask you this: is her desire to be a SAHM because she\u2019s traditional and really wants to be be the best homemaker she can be, or is she just finding another way to be lazy and take advantage of you? If she\u2019s a SAHM is she going to be a true, traditional homemaker and run the household, do all sorts of things to create thrift and save money, make an orderly house, attend to the children, etc? If she\u2019s actually going to do that, are you also traditional enough to actually WANT that sort of life where you take on the big financial burden in order to receive that in exchange? If the answer to all that is yes\u2026 then maybe her being a SAHM isn\u2019t a bad idea.\n\nIf the answer to any of that is no\u2026 this marriage has a serious problem and o don\u2019t think you should risk getting her pregnant until it\u2019s sorted out, especially since she might just view you as a meal ticket and if you get her pregnant she can potentially totally force you to continue paying for her even after a divorce.", "NTA. You're screwed man. What's hers is hers, and what's yours is hers. This is just the beginning of the arguments.", "\"She did not want to contribute to the bills and did not\"?

It\u2019s not fair on that baby for you guys to be struggling financially because your wife doesn\u2019t want to work & id pretty much guess she won\u2019t use any of her savings on buying stuff for the baby she\u2019ll expect you to buy it all! \n\nI\u2019d also be pissed about her current lack of contribution to your outgoings.

I do a fair share of chores now too.", "Interesting take however our initial agreement was 50/50 after schooling", "We tried her being stay at home but she complained I didn\u2019t do enough around the house", "I agree and that\u2019s my stance", "Dude she said she would pay 50/50 and has backed out,  she will not change.  All she will do is take you to the cleaners.", "Make sure you have your tax returns showing you worked while she was in school. You paid for her degree, no need to support her if you get divorced.", "I\u2019ll evaluate all my options", "In the eyes of the law.\n\nIt's not like at 17 years, 364 days and 23 hours old you're a helpless kid, and then as soon as the clock strikes midnight you're immediately blessed and bestowed with all the knowledge am adult should have. Even if some of you wish that was true.", "I literally make only 3% more than here. 60/40 or 70/30 could be a place to start though", "I\u2019ll look into it", "We do have a post-nup agreement where anything in one person\u2019s name will be the person\u2019s asset", "Please, dear god, either abstain from sex until this is figured out, or wear a condom.", "Don't have a child with her.  Once she has a child you cannot force her back to work if she just quits.  Watch out for her monkeying your birth control to get her way.", "I wouldn\u2019t be adding a baby to the mix until everything is sorted out and stable.", "Nope, no IF child.  Parenthood is a tough journey and if you\u2019re not both a team, it will eat your heart out.  Don\u2019t make any plans about children before you arrange your finances to suit you both.", "That's right, teenagers are actually way more competent and nowhere close to being a helpless kid even if the law says they're kids until 18.", "Fair she said she wants to take advantage of the maternity leave but then quit shortly after.", "I agree", "Fair point", "Or have her poke holes in the condom.", "Babies don't fix relationships. Ever.", "100% do not have a child with her. Not until you see some big changes in how she\u2019s behaving.", "Remember she was for the 50/50 split until she actually had to pay. This will never be resolved.", "Credit is so tertiary to this conversation compared to her just hoarding money while you pay for everything", "She will be obligated to work a little bit after the maternity leave she will take. However, my paternity leave is 2x as long with pay so it would make me stay with the kid.", "Alright that\u2019s a fair point", "I agree", "Well I have a security clearance that I need for my job, so it is a big deal", "Those are some huge assumptions. Even if she had planned to go right back to work, giving birth *frequently* results in issues where standard maternity leave is simply not enough time to fully recover. She could have a genuine need to have a longer leave, but with all this context it would strain your relationship either way. Your relationship is really not ready for the chaos and stress that a child brings."]}
