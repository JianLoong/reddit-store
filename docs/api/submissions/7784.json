Would CPS be at the door? It doesn\u2019t matter that the shower is a separate portion. A minor child was NAKED while adult men were shown into the bathroom the MINOR CHILD was using. See the big deal now?\u201d\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It was very clear you were in the shower from the sound, even if he didn't know the second he entered the bathroom. Staying there for 4 minutes was completely inappropriate and a complete violation of your privacy.", "NTA and that was super rude of your dad. Can you bring some friends over to show them some new makeup or something in the outer bathroom when he's taking a shower sometime? Point out that it's not different, except that in your case it's worse, because YOU ARE STILL A CHILD. Absolutely throw a fit. I'm sorry you dealt with this. It's absolutely inappropriate of your father.", "NTA\n\nDad needs to put a lock on that door.\n\nI\u2019m surprised they couldn\u2019t hear the fan and shower water from outside the door.", "Definitely NTA. You were taking a shower. Regardless of whether there is a separate door for the shower, it made you uncomfortable and that was your personal, private time. The bathroom door, I'm assuming, was shut. That's usually an indication to others in the home that someone is requesting privacy in that room. They completely disrespected that. \n\nPlus, showers don't last forever. There were signs (including, probably the bathroom door being shut) that someone was using the bathroom. They could have easily just waited the extra few minutes until you were done. They didn't have to barge in on your personal time in there.", "NTA. One of the most annoying traits some parents have is disrespecting their children's privacy.", "NTA at all. What a terrible invasion of privacy! I\u2019d have said \u201cI\u2019ll show you guys the bathroom a little later, my daughter is in the shower.\u201d I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA - your privacy comes first. Dad can show the house anytime.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nEven if no one saw you naked, the fact that you had no control of your privacy in a vulnerable place was a huge violation and really messed up. \n\nDad needs to put a lock on the bathroom door, it's really weird to not have one? And certainly not show strangers(!!!!) around while his teen daughter is in there.\n\nI can understand why you screamed at your folks. Try to approach them calmly with how you felt -- they are appealing to reason (it was separated) when they need to understand that you felt violated and scared in your own home that you'd be exposed and you had no control of your privacy and the situation.", "Huge NTA - I don't know why he would think it would be okay to do this", "First of all, NTA. As the father of a young girl, your concerns are legitimate and his actions were inappropriate. Regardless of how they try to justify it, it made you uncomfortable in a space where you expect some privacy. Your feelings are 100% valid and you need to express that to him.\n\nScreaming at him after the fact wasn't the right way to handle it, but I understand the emotions involved so I'll give you a pass on that one. When emotions have cooled a bit, you need to have a heart to heart with him. As part of that, I think you should probably apologize for the outburst, but it in no way negates the validity of your feelings that I talked about above, and he needs to understand that.\n\nI swear sometimes I read the posts in this sub to gain some perspective on stuff like this before my daughter hits her teenage years. It's just good to see things through the eyes of someone much closer to her age.", "NTA. That's grounds for someone calling the police given he walked in with grown-ass adults while you, his 14 year old kid, was showering.", "NTA that\u2019s really bad. I wouldn\u2019t feel safe and paranoid every time I showered.", "INFO - so your dad AND mom BOTH think you're overreacting?\n\nHonestly that does make me pause from an automatic NTA.  Yes of course you deserve privacy but if it were that obviously bad I think your mom would have blown up at your dad.\n\nHow separated is the shower from the rest of the bathroom?  I think you said there is a door there.  Is it almost like a separate room?  I ask bc I have seen some (really nice) bathrooms that are like multiple rooms.", "NTA.

Is there a way you can word this to your parents that would make them understand - maybe emphasizing that there were grown men one unlockable door away from you in the shower and you were terrified that one of them was going to open the door? They need to understand that this is a big deal, actually.", "Showering is one of those activities where you expect privacy and can easily feel vulnerable. Entering, despite knowing you were there, was a gross violation of your personal space. **NTA**", "NTA - maybe you should get one of those under the door handle locking bars to barricade the door to the bathroom in the future since your father has no problem picking the lock to bring people in where his naked 14-year-old is taking a shower.", "NTA\n\nWhat a gross experience. Dad\u2019s an AH, mom\u2019s an AH for defending him, and every single friend who stood in that room while hearing the shower was running is an AH.", "NTA. If he heard the shower than he heard you.", "NTA \n\nI would get a rubber wedge ($5.99 at Walmart) and start using it.

Please tell your mother, grandparents, trusted teacher.", "NTA- coming in with his friends like that while you were in the shower was an invasion of privacy, a disregard of boundaries, and a bunch of middle-aged men in the bathroom while you were showering is not exactly appropriate.", "You write really well for a 14 year old. NTA. He should respect your privacy and he definitely heard you \u2026 showers echo. \n\nMaybe it didn\u2019t need a yelling, but he needs a serious conversation about boundaries.

Why on earth would he bring people INTO a bathroom someone was showering in, let alone their teenage daughter?! NTA!", "NTA, but I do hope 'screaming' is an exaggeration.

If they still persist, show your friends the new bathroom while one of them is showering.", "NTA. Most definitely NTA. I saw OP posted in comments that Dad and his friends are family oriented and not creepy. That's great and all, but I want to point out that a Dad coming into the bathroom while their teenage daughter is showering is NOT normal or healthy behavior. You are entitled to your privacy when showering. This made you feel weird for a reason. You most definitely are NTA in this situation. I know you talked to your parents about this, but if it happens again I would urge you to speak with another adult or a therapist or someone who can act as a 3rd party to help facilitate a discussion with you and your parents.

Grab my towel and jump out the window?? I'm still so mad just thinking about it.", "My parents would just get super triggered if I phrased it like that. Plus, my dad and his friends aren't weirdos, my dad just doesn't have a concept of letting me have 20 damn minutes of privacy to myself.", "The fact that she's still a child with GROWN MEN in the bathroom with her after they knew she was there is absolutely inexcusable and inappropriate.", "They heard it! They knew I was in the shower. I just mean my dad may not have heard me screaming for him to get out, because the shower is pretty loud.", "Yeah, the outside door for the entire bathroom was shut and locked. I don't even know how my dad opened the outside door.", "Not to mention it was obvious the shower was on and his daughter was yelling at them to get out and not one of those adult males, including her father, thought to get out and direct the others to get out also and leave a female child to shower in privacy. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Yeah I was upset but I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea about my dad and his friends.

I\u2019m no way is there legal action to be had here. She was behind another closed door, and no one opened that door while she was showering. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean she overreacted or isn\u2019t right to feel like her privacy was invaded, but there definitely isn\u2019t anything for the police to do here.", "It's kind of like a separate room, but as soon as you walk in the shower is right in your view. It doesn't help that we have glass sliding doors instead of opaque shower curtains either.", "The fact that the shower is in a completely separate room is why I\u2019m inclined to say NAH. She still felt her privacy was violated, which is understandable. But her parents could have easily expected her not to since the shower is in its own room (similar to perhaps showing guests a bedroom while someone is using the attached bathroom behind a closed door in a normal home). \n\nWas yelling at him perhaps a bit of an overreaction? Maybe, if I\u2019m picturing this room layout right, but certainly not one that I don\u2019t understand (especially from a teenager), so I\u2019m not willing to call her an AH for it.", "Okay please don't get the wrong idea lol my dad is not a weirdo, he had no intention of going in the separate shower room. I'm just mad he opened the outside door and didn't wait ten minutes to give me proper privacy and peace of mind.", "I did lock the main one, or at least I'm pretty sure I did.

Yeah, it is different.", ">Screaming will always weaken your stance.\n\nHARD disagree here. I'm tired of this insistence on politeness and respectability in everything.

If that's not an option an aunt or grandma??", "He\u2019s a grown man, he has that concept \n\nHe just doesn\u2019t care", "Then trigger them.

If they don\u2019t think this is serious, they are definitely \u201cweirdos\u201d (perverts) because any decent adult would take steps to prevent what is essentially child sex abuse.

If she were I in the shower or was getting out of the shower without her towel on yet and your dad opened the door with his friend in there, how would she feel about that? It\u2019s gross how your parents are ok with grown ass man probably seeing you naked just because he wanted to show off.", "You done no wrong so NTA. No disrespect towards your dad here but he needs to exercise some common sense by installing a lock in the shower room. If dad refuses to install a lock, I suggest you buy two rubber door stoppers from a dollar store to wedge it under the door so that he cannot swing it open while you bathe", "The door was shut AND locked? And he STILL went in? What the actual...? :O !", "I\u2026.don\u2019t know if screaming at him was enough if this grown man picked a lock to get into a room his 14 year old child was showering in? \n\nI\u2019m going to assume for my own peace of mind the door was not locked and this was a mistake.  \n\nBut even assuming the very best of intentions, you could\u2019ve not heard them and come out of the shower room completely naked. You could\u2019ve left dirty underwear right there in the bathroom, sunny side up. There\u2019s so many boundaries this crosses, but I hope he\u2019s just a hapless idiot, oddly enough.", "I think I'd be concerned that none of these other 4 men thought it was weird and were ok standing in the bathroom while the shower was on.", "Considering that a grown ass man brought his friends into a place where his daughter was naked and showering behind a closed/locked door, that's grounds for calling a well-fair check because that's concerning behavior.", "Interesting.  NTA but wow that's strange that your mom didn't get super pissed about it.", "I\u2019m with you, up until the point that the door to the outer part of the bathroom was locked and forced open from the outside.", "Agree with this take of NAH since daughter was literally in a separate room. I think Dad overstepped boundaries, but quite likely unintentionally.  I would hope for Dad & daughter to explain their sides and for this to never happen again.", "Phew! Good to hear. Hopefully it won\u2019t happen again and your parents realise they need to respect your privacy.", "I understand perfectly that there was a closed, albeit non-locking, door between you and your father. Screaming is rarely the appropriate response", "\"I screamed at my dad afterwards\" this is where she went wrong. Calling out loudly to overcome the surrounding noise from the shower was fine. Screaming afterward is not.", "Maybe he isn\u2019t a creep.  But it\u2019s weird that an adult man would not realize it\u2019s weird to invite other adult men into the bathroom where his 14yr old daughter is showering.  \n\nOk.  Now that I\u2019ve typed that. I, just. Ugh.", "I understand how this post may have some people concerned, but this is just an isolated instance. I know my dad best, and he and his friends are good, family-oriented people.", "They didn't think it was an invasion of privacy so they wouldn't see that as a big issue. And if I pulled a stunt like that, how do you think that would turn out for me lol? And what would it even achieve? Plus, I'm not really inclined to tell everyone about my embarrassing moments.", "Oh yeah he's getting a lock soon, there was something wrong with the shower stall room door lock when we got the house.", "Exactly! Yeah, dad, I get that you're excited to show off our black marble sinks, but can you wait ten minutes for me to get out?!", "Guarantee there is no legal action here because he never actually brought anyone into the room where she was actually showering. They remained separated by a closed door at all times.", "If that\u2019s true, it definitely changes how I feel about the whole situation. I\u2019d want more info about the door situation. \n\nIf it is a door with a key, then he\u2019s the AH for using a key to unlock a door to a bathroom because that would mean someone\u2019s using it (if no key, then what the actual fuck). But the way she has described the bathroom makes it sound like they couldn\u2019t know she was showering until they got inside, so I can\u2019t imagine a father unlocking a locked bathroom with a 14yo daughter behind it unless he _knew_ she wouldn\u2019t be in a compromising position in front of male friends, y\u2019know?\n\nMaybe I\u2019m giving this stranger too much credit, but it seems more likely that the main door wasn\u2019t locked and they found out she was showering after entering the main room, so he just showed them the main bathroom and left her alone in the shower.", "Where in her post does it say that?", "Screaming was the prefect response \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "Yeah, I guess I was just really mad that he wasn't even apologizing and he and my mom thought it was completely okay.", "Her dad let his friends wander around while she was in the shower?   Irresponsible on his part.", "listen i dont think your dad is a perv but that's besides the point. you're a child and your parents shouldn't be putting you in vulnerable positions like that, even if no harm is meant. boundaries are real and the way he seems to have completely neglected that is not okay. you shouldn't be uncomfortable in your own home especially when it comes to your body.", "Great to know", "Yeah, that is so cringey and rude. I am upset FOR you and I wasn't even there! haha! That's definitely not okay. Don't let your parents make you feel bad for feeling upset and/or violated by his actions. He's an adult, he can have some patience and wait a few minutes to show them the bathroom. He could have shown his friends other areas of the house and then circled back to the bathroom.
