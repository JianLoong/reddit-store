Locking them in a specific pattern does not make them extra locked. I know this obviously,, but that doesn't change the way I feel. I feel safer a specific way, and so I can not fall into doing it the same way every night. Luckily I'm more afraid of losing control of myself than feeling unsafe from the way I lock the house up. So I fight it constantly, and to do that I have to be very aware of what I'm doing, and why.\n\nI'm not a psychiatrist who can diagnose OP's sister, nor would one do it from the post. But! It sounds to me ( my opinion only) that OP's sister may have a disorder stemming from childhood trauma. Her home life was hectic and unsafe emotionally. As a child she was not in control of her parent's marriage, her father's infidelity, the mother's reactions, or the divorce. Pushing that control outward in a childlike manner ( no roses, they end a marriage. Or even, they are cursed and the ROSES bring bad things. Avoiding certain days, certain things, certain triggers, that bring back that feeling of fear and helplessness ) that might be a reasonable ( for a child) way to feel safe and in control. The problem comes when she goes into adulthood with no professional help, no guidance of how to cope in a healthy manner. That the mother told OP that the sister is 'sensitive' and 'fragile' gives me the idea that the mother might have simply accepted the behaviors. Even enabled them to keep the peace. Maybe out of guilt or something. Regardless, there's now a 40 year old woman who has completely lost control of her behavior to the point of losing jobs and negatively effecting her most important relationships. It's overtaken her whole world. She needs help, but she's an adult so the family's choices are very limited now. It's quite sad..", "Thank you for sharing this! I think the way that OCD is often portrayed causes a lot of confusion. Even for people who struggle with it themselves. \n\nI didn't even realize that I had OCD until I was in adulthood.

It didn't show to other people either. \n\nSure, my friends thought it was a little extreme to always check under my car, in my trunk, and backseat, before getting in. But people close to me understood I had a legitimate reason to fear those things and be cautious. What they didn't see was locking my doors and windows in a certain pattern every night. Or the absolute panic that gripped me if I did it in the wrong order, and had to start over to 'fix' it. Those little rituals were harmless right? Understandable for someone who had been stalked and attacked. I told myself the same thing..until I told a therapist and they helped me realize that I didn't have to live that way.", "One of the things that particularly females with mental health issues (like OCD, ADHD or Autism) do is called masking. Because the gender bias of our culture is towards females being \"people pleasers\" and \"carers/nuturers\" young females learn early to cover their \"unacceptable \" behaviours.\nWhich is one of the reasons that females with these conditions are less likely to be diagnosed.\nIt's also why they can present differently to family  - as they let the mask slip - simply because maintaining the mask is exhausting and they may feel safer with family. \nSpeaking as a mom of an autistic daughter who was diagnosed at 23 - and we had no idea of the extent to which she struggled. \n\nNB I'm talking in general terms here because of course each individual is different, and this is a cultural issue rather than biological as far as I am aware.

Most of the stuff on AITA, even most stuff that involves outrageous bad behavior, is of this sort. Someone is mean or petty or bigoted or irresponsible or insensitive, but nonetheless you\u2019re dealing with a more or less rational individual in touch with consensus reality. After reading the original post as well as more comments from the OP in the comments section, the more obvious it is to me that this person is severely mentally ill, likely an unfit parent, and a potential danger to herself and others and yet the family is laughing this off as a quirk. It\u2019s not a quirk. It\u2019s severe mental illness and it needs to be handled seriously by the systems set up to handle these types of serious issues. The sister in the story is not in a rational state of mind to make normal decisions or exercise basic human competence. The family needs to stop enabling this and get the mental health and possibly the child protection systems involved. This is a very serious situation. It\u2019s not just interpersonal family drama. It\u2019s someone with worsening delusions of harm that are impacting work, children, family relationships, and her own mental health. This woman\u2019s mind must be Hell to live in. Don\u2019t just laugh it off. This is not normal. It\u2019s not acceptable. It is the farthest thing from normal or acceptable. This person needs an intervention from the mental health system and probably the child welfare system. I would honestly worry about leaving this person alone with her own children. What happens when the voices tell her one day that the children are the spawn of Satan and must be drowned? For God\u2019s sake, this is a potential Andrea Yates situation waiting to happen. Even if she is not there now, who is to say she won\u2019t be at some point down the road if this is allowed to continue? This person probably has some kind of psychosis or something like that. And with the proper help, maybe she can get her life back and live like a happier, healthier, more sane human being. I\u2019d encourage you to research mental illnesses with these symptoms more online as well as practical supports in your area to help families dealing with these challenges. When I initially said your sister belonged in an asylum, that was my flip and irreverent way of saying she was crazy in the generic way we as a society use the term (i.e. crazy ex-boyfriend or crazy ex-girlfriend or crazy roommate).

Don\u2019t take this lightly. If you take anything away from this thread, please take away this message. I can sometimes be blunt and flip and if you don\u2019t like the way I word things or I sound insensitive or judgmental, don\u2019t let that be a barrier to you recognizing the God honest truth of what I am saying here - this deeply disturbed woman needs serious help before she harms someone else or herself. I wish your family all the best as you deal with these serious issues.", "NTA.

There are parents with these kinds of mental problems that wind up murdering their children because of severe delusions. Your sister is obviously having serious delusions and that makes her a danger to herself and others. Everyone knows on some level the person is nuts but everyone tiptoes around it and as a result the children are in an abusive situation with an unfit parent. I would go no contact and seriously look into calling child protective services and instituting involuntary commitment of this person if you can. In some states, it is very easy to get people involuntarily committed. For example, it is easy to the point of the system itself being abused in Florida. But this would not be abusing the system; it would be protecting children from a menace to society. Just look for a way. I am normally pretty anti-involuntary commitment and I only recommend this here because this person has children and I would bet on my life that those children are at least sometimes in a dangerous and abusive environment because of how mentally unwell this parent is. This situation calls for outside involvement. \n\nYou should talk to some adult children raised by individuals like this if you doubt how important it is for the family to step in to protect children from mentally imbalanced parents of this sort. Some of these children you can\u2019t talk to because their parents murdered them or because the children were forced to kill the deranged parent in self-defense and were then unjustly imprisoned for doing so. I hear your downplaying her behavior and maybe it seems normal to you because you\u2019ve gotten used to it over your whole life. Please for the love of God listen to this and sit with it for as long as you need: This person is completely mentally imbalanced and dangerous by any reasonable standard. Someone in touch with consensus reality doesn\u2019t lose a job as an adult because they had a freak out over someone else receiving flowers. This person sounds like they have had multiple psychotic breaks and everyone in your family is pretending this is a harmless eccentricity. Parents don\u2019t get to have dangerous unhinged mental breakdowns anymore. They seek help or must have their children forcibly removed from their care before they can do any more damage to them. \n\nI am honestly the last person who would normally encourage something like this because I have a lot of philosophical objections to involuntary commitment and I think the system is rife for abuse. But I know of too many situations where children lived in Hell during their entire growing up years because of parents like this who were completely out of touch with consensus reality. When families like yours ignore or rationalize these issues, children wind up dead, abused, and/or having to defend themselves with deadly force from the unwell parent. It sounds harsh and extreme, but the reality is harsh and extreme. You need to hear this.\n\nI have a background in child welfare in the court system and have also done research on these issues. One case in particular stands out to me. The mother in this case sounds a lot like your sister. Over the years her behavior and delusions grew more unhinged. She abused her children, she thought that Mexican repairmen and the government were spying on her, etc. Some of these delusions sound comical until you realize how severely her family\u2019s welfare was impacted. Her extended family left her children to fend for themselves. They are in prison now because they were finally forced to fight back and defend themselves against their dangerous parent using deadly force. When children are involved, the family absolutely has to step in and get this person help by any means necessary and/or see to it that the children are left with a safer person while they are growing up. At the very least, can you imagine the unhinged thought processes she\u2019s passing on to these children through example that will be the same cancer on their lives, careers, and relationships that her delusions have been on hers?", "For God\u2019s sake, this person is a menace to her children. This is not healthy for or fair to them. Please step in and get this woman help and make sure those children are safe. This person is an unfit parent.

And he always makes it clear that he is not diagnosing this person, simply speaking on what it MIGHT look like IF this person had such and such disorder. It\u2019s not that hard to add an extra sentence to your comment or make it more generalized.", "NTA. Your sister made this visit all about her and her issues. Usurped her Mother\u2019s birthday. You both can do without your sister\u2019s Drama Queen act. Tell her when she gets counseling and grows up you will include her in things, until then leave her OFF the invitation list!", "NTA but I hope the family supports her in getting help instead of just enabling this because she could lead a happier life with help.\n\nETA- it\u2019s not your job or anyone else\u2019s to make sure she gets help. It just seems the other family may be in denial", ">*I snapped and said Mom and Dad got divorced because Dad was banging his way through our whole zip code in the 90s*\n\nGreat line", ">*Mom and our Aunt say I\u2019m TA and ... that I should have known better than to bring flowers*\n\nIf anyone needs reminded of how ludicrous this situation is, this line should underscore it", "Wow, NTA.  She's 41, not 14.  She is responsible for herself, and she should know better than to actually believe roses are cursed.  Your mom and aunt shouldn't be coddling a 41 year old.", "NTA", "NTA. Jan is a loser and not very bright", "Your sister is NOT delicate with thirty fucking seven. She needs therapy. NTA", "NTA - Your husband is a very smart man. Be like your husband on this one.", "I am the 3200 liker. Btw NTA", "There are a lot of elements when it comes to Jan that feel manipulative. Having OCD or another kind of mental illness does not preclude cruelty, vindictiveness, manipulative tendencies or just plain being an asshole drama queen. People can be mentally ill and still cause harm on purpose.", "OPs sister is freaking 41 years old. OP explained to her in polite way that their parents divorce was caused by their fathers actions, not the roses or other stupid thinks that their father tried to put in their minds. \n\nNTA", ">She only just recently started pulling shit like this on her husband and kids.\n\nOP mentions it in a comment: \"She only just recently started pulling shit like this on her husband and kids.\"", "You are right after re reading she doesn\u2019t mention kids.", "so, the divorce isn't a trauma from an early age but she still refers to your parents as \"mommy and daddy\" at 41?  Is she getting any support from her husband?  Or just enablement?", "She needs therapy and your mother shouldn\u2019t enable her. NTA", "Maybe she has OCD, which is fine  \n\n\nBut trying to make **other people** obey the weird little rules you've defined for yourself isn't part of OCD at all   \n\n\nThat's evidence of a completely different sort of personality trait", "I do MH work, and thought of OCD immediately. The unlucky numbers, the superstitions, the fear that something bad will happen, The intense response that she has when they some up. I think she should see a therapist/psychiatrist!\n\nNTA, OP. Ultimately she needs to learn that \"she has a tail,\" that her choices have consequences/that her actions will impact others, even if she doesn't think that it's that big of a deal.\n\nEdit: Obviously I'm not diagnosing OP's sibling, just saying that I noticed the symptoms and would be on guard with that.", "\u201cthey\u2019re just weird\u201d hahahahha that made me legit LOL", "For one day every year, my brother is five years older than me.", "My brother and I are the same age 4 days of the year!", "NTA. Your sister needs psychiatric help.", "NTA. Someone needs to do it. Wailing when 41 years old because of a 20 year divorce is just odd. Also I died at how you described the cheating as \u201cbanging his way through the zip code\u201d. Amazing", "ESH - You have every right to buy your mom roses. But it's pretty clear your sister has an undiagnosed disorder that's really ruining her life - a little sympathy while pushing her to seek help (but in a caring way, not as a snide remark) would be nice. She needs to be responsible for her actions, and it's not likely without treatment. Have an intervention.", "All of this. OP, I have some trauma I'm working through... which I'm in therapy for. I honestly feel like you should call your sister and be more gentle. Tell her you think she has some trauma to work through and that going to a therapist might be a good idea. Let her talk, but try to see if she'd be open to getting help.", "i 100% agree. i\u2019m literally the most emotionally delicate person ever, the smallest thing can send me into tears but due to that i overthink what i say to others because in my head everybody is like me. these types of \u201csensitive\u201d people just like to control others into doing things for their own benefit only with the \u201cbut i\u2019m sensitive\u201d excuse.", "Is your sister possibly autistic??", "That maybe so, but her child mind could have still been like \"mom always got mad when dad brought home flowers, thus flowers are bad\". And then never unlearned that. But I'm curious if sister just wasn't aware of the cheating, or chose to block it out.", "Could be either. Who knows?"]}
