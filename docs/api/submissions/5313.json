I can\u2019t believe she got herself FIRED over this overreacting to flowers. If that didn\u2019t tell her to seek help, what will?", "Or its just getting worse. Of course you have more information than the rest of us but your reasoning sounds to be coming more from frustration than understanding of what she is living.", "lololol", "I'm having a petty catharsis.", "It sounds like she has OCD. It\u2019s pretty common for OCD people to latch onto personal superstitions and follow them compulsively to the point of damaging their personal and professional lives.", "I have dermatillomania too and it's freaking awful.", "Lolol he probably was. My husband got me one of those genealogy DNA kits and we have three half-brothers.", "I'm 52 and she's Mom on a normal day. Mother when she's naughty and Mommy when I'm sick or tattling on the hubs.  lol", "I call my mom medusa. It started when I thought medusa was mean as a child, only to find out that\u2019s not the case but it was too late to change it at that point", "No, he was just a slimeball. She can and has functioned normally for decades around people whose respect she wants - there are a lot of people in our community who wouldn't believe her capable of this kind of behavior. It's only ever come up once or twice outside of family gatherings. She can control it.", "Can I borrow that one?", "Lmfao dude fuck Jan bro not the childhood trauma running so deep she reverted to child talk lol", ">My husband doesn't care, he just won't go to family functions with Jan there now.\n\nYup, that's the smart choice. Good for him.\n\nNTA- Jan is a couple decades over the age at which it would be embarrassing not to understand that roses aren't cursed. Good luck navigating this, because between her age and your mom's enabling, Jan is really unlikely to change. The sane thing is to probably join your husband in boycotting events with Jan, but admittedly that is a strain on the family that you will (wrongly) be blamed for so I know it will be tough to follow through. Still, whatever boundaries you can draw, you should. And you should keep them.", "Wtf ya your sister isn\u2019t 7 and is clearly messed up NTA and has weird issues clearly stemming from her childhood. She needs therapy ur ok", "NTA. Your sister has issues. She's holding onto a lie her father told her as a child and letting it affect her life to extreme levels. Imagine if we all walked around having outbursts because someone denied us being princesses? That's how unstable she sounds. Your parents should've gotten her therapy a long time ago. You didn't do anything wrong by shutting her down.", "NTA at 41 its time for Jan to seek proffesional help.", "NTA, it is her choice to not live in reality and you are under no obligation to conform to her chosen delusions about reality.\n\nBut she needs serious therapy.", "Your mom and aunt are doing her no favors with the delicate and sensitive thing. Its obvious to thousands on the internet she needs someone to give her a proper diagnosis for her mental illness. I know reddit really pushes the therapy or divorce routes, but seriously, one read and it's painfully obvious she's someone who needs professional help.\n\nNTA. Mom and aunt should persuade her to seek help rather than coddle her. She's on her way to destroy her own family this way. We're going to see her kids on here at raised by narcissist sub or border lines or others at this rate.", "NTA, her behaviour doesn\u2019t sound normal", "NTA. You could\u2019ve not flipped on her quite as harshly, but she has been on this nonsense for years apparently. And she is performing an entire production herself every time. She really needs therapy. It\u2019s affecting her life and her ability to function like an adult. I\u2019m sad for her.\n\nIf you want to mend a bit you could have a talk with her about the incident, maybe softly encourage her to talk to someone about her unprocessed trauma from the divorce.", "NTA, your sister reacted like an actual toddler, she's a full grown woman, if she can't act like an adult, then she needs therapy. I don't understand why your mum would blame you and not try and encourage Jan into seeking some sort of medical attention, it's clear she needs it.", "Could she have ocd?", "NTA. If you're able, you could try to help your sister find a therapist though?", "NTA. For Xmas, Jan needs therapy.", "Curses aren\u2019t real, and shit 20 years? Tell her to grow the fuck up", "Did OP say she has kids? The post mentions \u201cJan and her family\u201d arrive, but later \u201cJan and her husband\u201d left, so I don\u2019t think there are any kids involved.", "> when a colleague of hers was sent roses from her husband which led to her being fired\n\nOh God that's horrible. She really need to go to therapist years ago. Thinking it's cursed or something is another thing. But then react THAT badly is way beyond normal.\n\nWhat a cursed life she lived in", "OP I\u2019m going to reply directly to you. It sounds like your sister may have OCD. I lived with someone like this during my time at university and it was exhausting. If your sister is open to it, broach the topic with her and see if she\u2019s open to the wolf speaking with a professional", "Came here to say this also! I had OCD as a teenager and this sounds very like OCD!", "It is TOTALLY our minds screwing with us. It's helpful to acknowledge that. \n\nMy OCD is trauma based. All of my little rituals ensure my personal safety. Lock the doors THIS way, so no one can get inside my house. Obviously that is irrational. The doors are locked, or they aren't. Locking them in a specific pattern does not make them extra locked. I know this obviously,, but that doesn't change the way I feel. I feel safer a specific way, and so I can not fall into doing it the same way every night. Luckily I'm more afraid of losing control of myself than feeling unsafe from the way I lock the house up. So I fight it constantly, and to do that I have to be very aware of what I'm doing, and why.\n\nI'm not a psychiatrist who can diagnose OP's sister, nor would one do it from the post. But! It sounds to me ( my opinion only) that OP's sister may have a disorder stemming from childhood trauma. Her home life was hectic and unsafe emotionally. As a child she was not in control of her parent's marriage, her father's infidelity, the mother's reactions, or the divorce. Pushing that control outward in a childlike manner ( no roses, they end a marriage. Or even, they are cursed and the ROSES bring bad things. Avoiding certain days, certain things, certain triggers, that bring back that feeling of fear and helplessness ) that might be a reasonable ( for a child) way to feel safe and in control. The problem comes when she goes into adulthood with no professional help, no guidance of how to cope in a healthy manner. That the mother told OP that the sister is 'sensitive' and 'fragile' gives me the idea that the mother might have simply accepted the behaviors. Even enabled them to keep the peace. Maybe out of guilt or something. Regardless, there's now a 40 year old woman who has completely lost control of her behavior to the point of losing jobs and negatively effecting her most important relationships. It's overtaken her whole world. She needs help, but she's an adult so the family's choices are very limited now. It's quite sad..", "Thank you for sharing this! I think the way that OCD is often portrayed causes a lot of confusion. Even for people who struggle with it themselves. \n\nI didn't even realize that I had OCD until I was in adulthood. It didn't 'look' like it did in movies or shows, or even most of what I read. It didn't show to other people either. \n\nSure, my friends thought it was a little extreme to always check under my car, in my trunk, and backseat, before getting in. But people close to me understood I had a legitimate reason to fear those things and be cautious. What they didn't see was locking my doors and windows in a certain pattern every night. Or the absolute panic that gripped me if I did it in the wrong order, and had to start over to 'fix' it. Those little rituals were harmless right? Understandable for someone who had been stalked and attacked. I told myself the same thing..until I told a therapist and they helped me realize that I didn't have to live that way.", "One of the things that particularly females with mental health issues (like OCD, ADHD or Autism) do is called masking. Because the gender bias of our culture is towards females being \"people pleasers\" and \"carers/nuturers\" young females learn early to cover their \"unacceptable \" behaviours.\nWhich is one of the reasons that females with these conditions are less likely to be diagnosed.\nIt's also why they can present differently to family  - as they let the mask slip - simply because maintaining the mask is exhausting and they may feel safer with family. \nSpeaking as a mom of an autistic daughter who was diagnosed at 23 - and we had no idea of the extent to which she struggled. \n\nNB I'm talking in general terms here because of course each individual is different, and this is a cultural issue rather than biological as far as I am aware. Whether it should be this way is a whole different debate.", "I'm so sorry. That must have been awful for you and your children. Your sister as well. \n\nI suppose I'm 'lucky' that mine is all about personal safety. Checking the doors and windows in a certain order. Checking under the car, in the trunk, the backseat. Beeping the door locks 3 times to get a double beep. I do those things to keep myself safe, even when it's irrational. It's frustrating, but it's more easily hidden and rarely effects others. I work darn hard to make sure that I'm the only one inconvenienced or upset.", "That's how mine is. Most people have no idea since my OCD blends so well. I've actually had people tell me it's rude to joke about having OCD so casually when there are people out there who are *really* suffering.\n\nWhen I say \"My OCD is making me [insert action]\" I *really* mean I'm being forced to do something I know is irrational or a waste of time but I don't get a choice. My options are to do \"the thing\" or have a meltdown and derail the whole rest of my day. It's non negotiable. The emotional consequences and the time those consequences consume are too high. \n\nI'm not simply saying I'd prefer to do [insert action]. I'm saying I'd prefer to NOT but if I DON'T do whatever it is shit is going to go downhill *really fucking fast* and my mid 30 year old ass might end up having a breakdown in a grocery store or stuck in parking lot to panicked to drive or simply emotionally paralyzed and stuck on the couch for the rest of the day.\n\n\nBut because I don't hop on each foot in increments of 4 while whistling Yankee Doodle Dandy (or some such shit) people just assume I'm joking about the whole OCD thing.", " I wish I could reach through the screen and give you a hug. As someone who has absolutely had a full blown, very public, breakdown because my key fob battery died..it sucks. Inside my head I was telling myself to pull it together and just grab the extra battery I carried in my glove compartment, but I just stood there crying. Shaking. Hyperventilating. And pushing the stupid fob button a million times. I absolutely lost my shit. Then there was the fun humiliation once I realized PEOPLE HAD SEEN ME LIKE THAT. It took days to recover. It still makes me shudder thinking of it now. I about ran to the window to relock my car just now. I'm sure the neighbors will be thrilled, lol.\n\nAlso, the mental picture you painted of what people think OCD should look like gave me a nice laugh! There really is a narrow idea of what people expect, and they are always surprised I don't wash my hands 50 times and need my fruit bowl to be arranged just so. Lol, I've been spared that thankfully!"]}
