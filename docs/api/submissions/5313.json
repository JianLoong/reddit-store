Growing up it was evident from a young age that their marriage was messed up. Dad cheated a lot and never tried to hide it.\n\nWhen I was six and Jan was nine, Dad got Mom a dozen roses. Using context clues from things I remember at that time and confirmation from family, he was trying to apologize for an affair that got out of hand which led to a huge fight. A few years later Jan saw something romantic/cutesy on TV and asked why he never got Mom flowers. Dad said, \"roses are cursed and make your mom mad at me\". \n\nJan periodically brings up the \"roses are cursed!\" bs every few years. I can't keep track of what upsets Jan. She also thinks dates that end in a one or two are cursed, blue trucks on the highway are cursed, types of food, and a bunch of other stuff nobody should be expected to remember.\n\nIt was Mom's birthday this weekend and her boyfriend hosted brunch. I wasn\u2019t thinking and got Mom an arrangement that included roses. Mom loved it and put it in the kitchen. Jan showed up later with her family, all smiles until about an hour later when she went into the kitchen, let out a bloodcurdling wail, and started crying that roses were cursed and \"made Mommy divorce Daddy\". \n\nShe ranted that I cursed the family by bringing roses into the house on Mom's birthday. I snapped and said Mom and Dad got divorced because Dad was banging his way through our whole zip code in the 90s. Flowers aren't cursed, we're not cursed, that Dad made bad choices and if she couldn't come to terms with that then she needed to seek treatment because her behavior wasn't acceptable or normal. She looked at me like I had interrupted her Oscar speech. She and her husband left and we tried to salvage the day. Mom's boyfriend thanked me, but Mom and our Aunt say I\u2019m TA and Jan is \"sensitive\" and \"delicate\" and that I should have known better than to bring flowers.

She couldn't have the television on odd number sound levels. She slept with a hammer because of the people who come into your house when you are sleeping. Not blue trucks but definitely volvos were cursed. She couldn't have potatoes on the same day she had oatmeal because it would mean she would get fired. There was a lot.

After 20 years she\u2019s obviously not coping and needs professional help if she hasn\u2019t figured it out on her own by now.
