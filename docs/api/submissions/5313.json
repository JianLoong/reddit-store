Growing up it was evident from a young age that their marriage was messed up. Dad cheated a lot and never tried to hide it.\n\nWhen I was six and Jan was nine, Dad got Mom a dozen roses. Using context clues from things I remember at that time and confirmation from family, he was trying to apologize for an affair that got out of hand which led to a huge fight. A few years later Jan saw something romantic/cutesy on TV and asked why he never got Mom flowers. Dad said, \"roses are cursed and make your mom mad at me\". \n\nJan periodically brings up the \"roses are cursed!\" bs every few years. I can't keep track of what upsets Jan. She also thinks dates that end in a one or two are cursed, blue trucks on the highway are cursed, types of food, and a bunch of other stuff nobody should be expected to remember.\n\nIt was Mom's birthday this weekend and her boyfriend hosted brunch. I wasn\u2019t thinking and got Mom an arrangement that included roses. Mom loved it and put it in the kitchen. Jan showed up later with her family, all smiles until about an hour later when she went into the kitchen, let out a bloodcurdling wail, and started crying that roses were cursed and \"made Mommy divorce Daddy\". \n\nShe ranted that I cursed the family by bringing roses into the house on Mom's birthday. I snapped and said Mom and Dad got divorced because Dad was banging his way through our whole zip code in the 90s. Flowers aren't cursed, we're not cursed, that Dad made bad choices and if she couldn't come to terms with that then she needed to seek treatment because her behavior wasn't acceptable or normal. She looked at me like I had interrupted her Oscar speech. She and her husband left and we tried to salvage the day. Mom's boyfriend thanked me, but Mom and our Aunt say I\u2019m TA and Jan is \"sensitive\" and \"delicate\" and that I should have known better than to bring flowers. My husband doesn't care, he just won't go to family functions with Jan there now.", "created_utc": 1671650133, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrxxjq/aita_for_telling_my_adult_sister_that_our_family/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister clearly has a lot of unprocessed trauma from the divorce. This is absolutely not normal for a grown woman to react this way 20+ years later. She needs serious therapy.", "Nta, and I think she should consider theropy. I think she knows things aren't \"cursed\", but, developed the acciation of certain things with one of the worst things in her childhood: your parents divorce. She needs help.", "NTA - She attacked you from a position of self-righteousness and irrationality then got shocked that you both defended your self and pointed out that the issue lay with her. You only other option was to put up with her nonsense.\n\nHere's the thing: she is an adult and well past the time when \"sensitivity\" can be an excuse for her behavior. If she is having trouble coping with an arrangement of flowers by this point she definitely needs professional help. I am saying this very sincerely because her reaction to the flowers and treatment of you over them is not normal or healthy.", "NTA. Thank you for being the voice of reason in the family. While Jan created her own make believe world to comfort herself, you guys shouldn\u2019t go along with it.

She needs to see someone about it because this is definitely going to backfire in a world where roses are considered a default \u201cI care about you\u201d flower.\n\nAlso, she is 41 so I assume you have seen some variation on this behaviour before so I understand why you snapped.", "Definitely NTA. Your sister is unhinged!  She definitely needs so therapy!! Shes in denial and I think about your father and why they divorced and it\u2019s made her the way she is. When she this outburst happened it\u2019s almost like she was in a disassociated state and was speaking as if she was a child again.", "NTA. Her behavior would be questionable at 10 years old. At 41? Good lord. She needs professional help.", "NTA but you and her didn't live the same past.\n\nThis was a really tough one for me to learn-\nMy trauma from our childhood isn't the same as my brother's and sisters trauma even if we lived through the same event.\n\nIt seems like these \"curses\" are a way for her to control things that can't be uncontrolled and are overwhelming for her.\n\nI get it seems like she is victimising herself but maybe she doesn't have the same emotional strength, mental skills or tools that you do.\n\nIt's ok you snapped, family is super frustrating but try to remember something that scares you doesn't scare someone else.\nSomething that makes you laugh doesn't make someone else laugh.\n\nTrauma and memories are the same way.", "It sounds like your sister has [OCD](https://beyondocd.org/expert-perspectives/articles/very-superstitious) and while you're NTA, yelling at her won't help.

A 41 year old creaming at the sight of a rose and declaring that roses made her parents get divorced is... concerning. Seriously. At this age she should have worked through your parents divorce by now and coddling her and tiptoeing around her weird triggers is not actually helping her.", "NTA.

Not sure why you're looking for a fight, but I said the exact words you said would be alright... so I'm not really sure what you want.", "Because you literally can\u2019t know that from one post off the internet. And it is extremely harmful to imply that someone has something when you have no idea. It\u2019s not the \u201csounds like\u201d that\u2019s the issue. It\u2019s you trying to specify a specific disorder. There are multiple disorders that could cause this kind of obsession/paranoia/etc."]}
