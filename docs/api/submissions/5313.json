The bizarre rules. The anxiety and panic when confronted with a trigger, and having an unmanageable reaction. \n\nRegardless of what is going on, she is an adult who is responsible for her own mental health.

The Brits, nor Australians, never call their mothers \u201cMommy or Mom\u201d.", "When I was little, I woke up super early and grabbed what was left of the cold KFC in the fridge. I was eating cold fried chicken watching morning cartoons and then I suddenly got sick and threw up. Immediately there was a loud knock at the door and they were shouting \"police open up!\" and me being 4/5 years old and having no understanding of the situation thought my throwing up was getting us in trouble. My parents answered the door and we were being evicted, we had 5 minutes to collect our belongings. \n\nIt makes ZERO sense now, but my little brain made the connection that KFC made us homeless, so I would not eat KFC and I would panic smelling it or seeing it. It was a major trigger. And I knew as I got older that KFC didn't make us homeless, my brain thought \"...but what if...\" So I avoided it like the plague. I have a bunch of little things like that, connections I made as a kid in a shitty situation to things that were tangible and I could attach the fear to, so I could keep myself safe from that fear by just avoiding THE THING.", "Some of us do. I'm from the Black Country and \"mum\" feels weird for me to even type. You can even find greeting cards locally with Mom on.", "What if their mother was American? Did you foresee immigration in your scenario!? I think not!\n\n(Though from what I've read the children seem to default to whatever the standard vernacular is so mum/mom will win based off location)", "It\u2019s really not though. Some people don\u2019t even know that certain diagnosis even exist, or what the symptoms look like. If someone at work hadn\u2019t told me that they thought I should get tested for ADHD I never would have realized I had it because I am inattentive type. I didn\u2019t even know that was a thing. I thought I was just bad at being a person. The diagnosis changed my life. I had new coping mechanisms that worked, I had answers for questions I\u2019d been asking my whole adult life, and medication literally saved me from my own executive dysfunction. A lot of mental illness and/or disorders are underreported because people don\u2019t even realize they have it. It does not harm the mental health community to speak openly about mental health issues. No harm comes to anyone when someone says, \u201chey I am this, you\u2019re displaying a lot of the signs. If these symptoms are prominent in your life and effect it negatively you might consider getting screened. At least to rule it out if you don\u2019t have it. That way you and your doctor can better navigate your care plan.\u201d. There is nothing wrong with saying the sister is displaying signs of OCD. (She is btw. You don\u2019t need to be a psychiatrist to know she is fixated on and obsessing over these curses. OP said she has lost a job over it! If that\u2019s not a debilitating mental health issue then what is?) in my opinion you\u2019re doing more damage to the mental health community with this weird gate keeping. How crappy do my thoughts and life have to be before I can join the crazy kids club? Scary intrusive thoughts? Self harm? If someone\u2019s quality of life is being effected by their mental state, then they qualify as mentally unwell. Maybe not full blown illness, but it will become that if they don\u2019t treat it. Awareness is not a bad thing.", "*THIS!!! THANK YOU!!!*\n\nA friend of mine that I care for deeply has unresolved trauma, knows it...and refuses to get help for it. I've had to distance myself because of his unstable behavior, even though it hurts. So this sentence resonates with me *a lot.* Thank you.", "Well said."]}
