I moved in with Chelsea 5 months ago, friends since we were 15. Chelsea has a 6 month old baby, the father is not in the picture. \n\nWe both have jobs, we split the bills equally. I also clean up and help with groceries. I don\u2019t mind, I love to help out. I\u2019m not good with children though, I don\u2019t know the first thing about taking care of one, I am the youngest by 11 years out of my siblings, I have no experience with babies I\u2019m not even sure how to make a bottle.  I have occasionally watched the baby, if she wanted to shower or nap or run to the store, but never longer then an hour with Chelsea not home. \n\nYesterday Chelsea had work and asked me if I could watch the baby since I was off. It was a 7 hour shift, and I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and asked if someone else could. She said it was fine and she would find someone. \n\nI was in my room when she left for work and she shot me a text saying the baby was in the room asleep, she had left for work and we would be fine. \n\nI was a little nervous but was like okay whatever. Well about an hour goes by and the baby wakes up screaming. I cannot calm him down, she\u2019s not answering her phone so I call her mom(she only lives like 10 minutes away) \n\nHer mom comes and gets the baby. I apologize, her moms fine with it. I text Chelsea and let her know her mom has the baby. When she got off work she went straight to her room, walking past me in the kitchen ignoring me. This morning she was really angry at me and said she lets me live here the least I could\u2019ve done was watch the baby. Then she told me she was reconsidering our living arrangements. \n\nI apologized and explained the baby woke up, and told her I would be homeless. She just walked away from me and has been in her room all day. \n\nI do around the house as much as her, I even tried to watch the baby but he woke up. I now feel really guilty but I didn\u2019t know what else to do.", "created_utc": 1675467734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10sz2wb/aita_for_calling_my_roommates_mom_after_she_left/", "score": 583, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(I am disabled and trying my best) but I'd never think for a second to just say \"watch my son while I dissapear for x ammount of time??\" \n\nI'm talking about a cat but OPS roommate really messed up.", "NTA. Why couldn't your roommate ask her mom to watch the baby, since she's 10 minutes away according to your post?", "Oh sweetie. Chelsea is not your friend. She is a user, and the older you get, the more it\u2019ll pop out. You deserve better. Find another place, because you don\u2019t deserve to be held hostage by her. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nThat is not right that she left the baby with you without your consent. She is lucky you were home and your phone wasn\u2019t dead or something. Who knows what would\u2019ve happened then? Extremely irresponsible of her. And very immature of her to threaten to kick you out of her house for not doing her a favor?", "If her mom lives 10 minutes away and gladly comes to get the baby, why in all the ten hells did she not ask her mom to begin with?!  She literally left her baby with someone who expressly stated that she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable watching a baby for long periods of time.  Christ above, OP, you are definitely not the asshole.", "She left you with a young infant knowing you don't even know how to make a bottle even after being told you weren't comfortable doing so. She is lucky you called her mom and not cps. It is her job as a parent to find proper childcare not shift it on you. NTA", "NTA at all. This is why you share a lease and don't acceot random rooms. It is an illegal living situation deoending on where you live, and she could get evicted if it's not her house.\n\nI'd be finding another place, with a friend if it is an option. If not, make some friends.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have experience taking care of a child. Hech your a child yourself ( not ment in a mean way). Taking care of a baby for 7 hours is so long. And it is unbelievable that your friend just left and only sent a message.", "NTA what she did was literally a crime.", "Sweetheart it\u2019s time to move, she\u2019s looking into making you her babysitter.. and I\u2019m not understanding how she can make you homeless when I\u2019m assuming you are paying rent and bills? But be that as it may it\u2019s time to move on and find yourself a new situation. This will not be the only time she pulls this.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry this got dumped on you. You do need to find a new place to live. A stunt like that where she dumped the baby on you after you said no can get her into major trouble. Sounds like she'll make it your problem. I'm also sorry that your friendship ended the way it did.", "I'd have left it a while and then text her saying, \"Shit, I didn't even see the baby when I left this morning. I made plans, I'm not home.\" and then spent the day looking for a new place to live. NTA. Unfair, unsafe and immature on her part.", "NTA, What an irresponsible mother! What if you had plans?! Or left without her knowing, she would leave the poor baby alone in the house!. While she has her own mother living close by.\nIf you pay half of every bill, she doesn't have any right to hold this over you. You are not her free babysitter. She shouldn't have gotten pregnant at 18, now she is a mother and needs to be responsible.. I can't imagine either handling an infant before I had my own. So it is understandable, you wouldn't want to be left with someone else's baby alone. Again, you are not the one who got pregnant, you shouldn't be the one dealing with those responsibilities at your age. Occasional help is fine, but she acts very entitled to your help. No other roommate would be any happier with being considered a free babysitter", "Chelsea is not your friend, no matter what things used to be like between you. Seriously, for your own good and safety you have to get out of there SOON.\n\nUntil you've been there you cannot imagine what it is like to have 24/7 responsibility for a baby. Chelsea has no backup, and, seriously---no matter what your pre-baby friendship was, you cannot provide the help she needs. She has legal responsibilities to meet and you can fall into a legal position of failing that can ruin your future. If you have ANY other place to go, including a shelter, you should do that.", "Chelsea has made new demands on you; she wants you to watch her baby when you are not working.  She has indicated she wants a flat mate who will be her babysitter - good luck with that, lol.\n\nI wonder who normally babysits when you are both working?  The Mum I suppose?  Anyway, not relevant.\n\nIf you value your freedom and do not want to be roped into co-parenting Chelsea's baby (this will probably escalate until you're expected to help feed and bathe the baby, put it down to sleep, etc) you should look for alternate living arrangements.", "This.", "Rent is a bill", "She can't kick you out. You Have rights as a tenant. Even if you aren't on the lease. She would have to evict you through the courts most likely. She would need to give you a 30 day notice or more. Depending on where you live", "She can't kick her out even if she's not on the lease. She or the landlord would have to start eviction process on her because it is her established residence at this point."]}
