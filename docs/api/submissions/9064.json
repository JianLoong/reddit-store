I moved in with Chelsea 5 months ago, friends since we were 15. Chelsea has a 6 month old baby, the father is not in the picture. \n\nWe both have jobs, we split the bills equally. I also clean up and help with groceries. I don\u2019t mind, I love to help out. I\u2019m not good with children though, I don\u2019t know the first thing about taking care of one, I am the youngest by 11 years out of my siblings, I have no experience with babies I\u2019m not even sure how to make a bottle.  I have occasionally watched the baby, if she wanted to shower or nap or run to the store, but never longer then an hour with Chelsea not home. \n\nYesterday Chelsea had work and asked me if I could watch the baby since I was off. It was a 7 hour shift, and I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and asked if someone else could. She said it was fine and she would find someone. \n\nI was in my room when she left for work and she shot me a text saying the baby was in the room asleep, she had left for work and we would be fine. \n\nI was a little nervous but was like okay whatever. Well about an hour goes by and the baby wakes up screaming. I cannot calm him down, she\u2019s not answering her phone so I call her mom(she only lives like 10 minutes away) \n\nHer mom comes and gets the baby. I apologize, her moms fine with it. I text Chelsea and let her know her mom has the baby. When she got off work she went straight to her room, walking past me in the kitchen ignoring me. This morning she was really angry at me and said she lets me live here the least I could\u2019ve done was watch the baby. Then she told me she was reconsidering our living arrangements. \n\nI apologized and explained the baby woke up, and told her I would be homeless. She just walked away from me and has been in her room all day. \n\nI do around the house as much as her, I even tried to watch the baby but he woke up. I now feel really guilty but I didn\u2019t know what else to do.", "created_utc": 1675467734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10sz2wb/aita_for_calling_my_roommates_mom_after_she_left/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did the right thing.", "Being roommates doesn\u2019t mean that you get to be a parent to someone else\u2019s baby. Bottom line is that you\u2019re living with an irresponsible human being.

You are not her servant.

She abandoned her child without a clearly committed sitter.", "You need to find an alternative living arrangement if this is how she behaves with you.

Chelsea is a hot mess and toxic. She left an infant with someone who is uninterested, unwilling, and unable to care for her child.

Do not stay there. \n\nI could see a scenario where she leaves the bay alone and then claims you agreed to be there or that you left the baby. Seriously, she is unfit and could blame you or accuse you of something. Get out as fast as you can.", "NTA. You made it clear that you were uncomfortable watching the baby, and Chelsea ignored that clear statement to foist a defenseless human life on you.

And she was gonna be gone for 7 hours???\n\nThat is wrong on so many levels. \n\nAnd her mom lives 10min away and could take the baby so obviously she had options.", "NTA.  How is she letting you live there if you split the bills equally? Find a new place to live.

Who just leaves their baby alone after being told it wouldn't be feasible to look after it?", "NTA she clearly is though. Who would dump a baby on someone who has clearly articulated they are not comfortable doing it, after committing to get someone to look after them. Yeah not cool behavior from Chelsea.", "NTA. And find a new roommate/apartment ASAP.", "NTA\n\nYou should look for other living arrangements.\n\nCan she afford the place on her own?", "Nta you did the nice thing, calling baby's grandma.

Her baby isn't your problem, you made it clear you were uncomfortable, she then said \"It's fine, I'll figure it out\" which any reasonable person would assume that she was looking for alternative care for her baby.

You should consider finding a new roommate if she's going hold you living situation over you like that.", "NTA. It is never ok to leave a child of any age with someone, withoyt their express consent! \n\nYou pay rent and bills and do chores, that is the least you can do for her letting you live there. \n\nYou need to move.

I would probably also be looking for alternative living arrangements.", "Definitely NTA.   \n\n\nWhat she did was not only thoughtless, but possibly illegal. If I were you, I'd start saving money to find a new place. She's just made your living situation untenable if she thinks she has some right to drop her baby on you, you're a roommate splitting rent, you're not the daddy.", "NTA.

Find yourself another place asap.", "Info: You said you split the BILLS evenly. Does that include rent?", "ESH Why are you being so weak-kneed and apologetic? She left the baby on you because she was either too lazy to get a babysitter or wanted a free babysitter aka you! And for the two cherries on top she left the baby behind without your knowledge and didn't answer your calls. Quit rolling over and lay down some boundaries already!", "nta", "NTA. I think she's using you for free childcare.", "NTA. You told her you're not comfortable with it, so she told you she'd find someone else. Then, she suddenly decides to use you as free babysitting after all, despite you saying you didn't want to and not even agreeing to it or her letting you know. IMO, she left without telling you so you couldn't refuse.\n\nShe is an asshole for threatening to evict you over this. It's not like you agreed to babysit, then suddenly forgot the baby was in the house and left to go get drunk.", "NTA. She should know that it's dangerous to leave a baby with someone inexperience-- and maybe she should've heeded your wish before making the decision for you.", "I hope you really are not confused here. You are absolutely NTA! \n\nAre you both on the lease? Please make sure you save receipts of all of the expenses you pay so that you can provide proof if needed. Do not let this person walk all over you. Please stand up for yourself and remind her that you contribute equally to the living situation and she can not just \"kick you out\". SHE LIED TO YOU and made it like it was ok that you were not comfortable with watching the baby, and then she went and pulled some really shady shit that makes her a bad mother by leaving the baby without your permission.

And she\u2019s going to have a very hard time finding a room with an infant in the house.", "She should be upset with herself forcing her child on you like that that's who she should be upset with", "Well, you shouldn't. She wouldn't be upset if she did the responsible thing and got a babysitter but she didn't. You wanna know why? 'Cuz she was too cheap to pay for one and saw a free babysitter in you. OP, she absolutely knew what she was doing and just didn't want to pay a babysitter. That's all. Nor were you responsible for her not answering the phone. Sounds like it's time to look into different places to move into, and this time? Don't get a roommate that has a kid/s.", "Don't feel guilty.  If she had perhaps sat you down and talked you through looking after the baby, maybe you would even have been fine with it.  Being thrown into that situation with no idea what to do is really unfair to you and dangerous for the baby. She needed to explain how and when to feed, change, calm down, all sorts of things.  And she did not.  Babies don't sleep for 7 hours. They need looking after.  She was very neglectful and it is absolutely not your fault.  You did the correct thing in calling her mother.  \n\nIt might be wise to apologise (even though you are not wrong) to keep your home and then look to finding somewhere else as soon as you can.", "Then NTA. She doesn\u2019t \u201clet\u201d you live there. You pay for that privilege. So you are not obligated to provide babysitting on top of it.", "I\u2019m not on the lease but I do pay rent, and cover bills."]}
