The kid is 2, I highly doubt he intentionally broke the vase so she needs to relax", "NTA - HIS SON broke the vase and you were trying to ensure HIS son didn't panic...I see no issues. Not trying to take away from it being your son but the way he's acting is if a strangers child broke the vase  not his own child.", "NTA\n\n\ud83e\udd23\n\nI keep telling people who want to have kids that if they really love an object, they should keep it far away from the child. Everybody said their child will \"behave\". \n\nIf not, it's not the child's fault if it gets broken.\n\nNot even my husband didn't believe this is the solution, until he saw our youngest grabbing a hammer from his toolbox, which was inside a closet, and trying to repair the TV from the living room.\n\nBut he wasn't that scared that the baby (18 months) will destroy the TV - he was thinking what could have happened with all that shattered glass and stuff.\n\nSo your ex is really really really wrong and should think about it...\n\nHis girlfriend isn't exactly your friend so there's nothing to say about her.\n\nAnd saying \"whoopsie\" isn't bad at all.\n\nScreaming at the baby will be the worst possible choice.\n\nI use(d) \"whoops(ie)\" in order not to scare my babies too.\n\nThey both are too offended for an broken object...\n\nGood for his mother - she knew what matters!", "NTA at all\n\nIts a vase, they break easily. You can buy another.\n\nSounds like the new GF doesn't like you or your kid and is pissed that she isn't the center of the universe", "If you have a toddler in the house you shouldn\u2019t have anything on display and within reach that can be broken, if you want to keep it intact.\n\nHe only has himself to blame imo.", "NTA.\n\nLet's rephrase that.  Your ex's son broke a vase that your ex's mother gave to your ex. \n\nIt wasn't your house, it wasn't your vase, it wasn't your mother, and it shouldn't have been your responsibility to keep your son from your ex's things while he was AT your ex's place.\n\nYour tone of voice nor anything you said when you witnessed the accident matters here.", "Hard NTA.", "You don't have to continue engaging in conversation about this issue. NTA.", "NTA only because I don't understand why you're expected to be the only parent when you're at your ex's house.  Where was your ex? However, if that was your only reaction, it's poor parenting on your part.  Once the kid is calmed down, you have a teachable moment to tell your kid that's why he doesn't run around in the house. because he can  break things. If he wants to run, he has to go outside, or in his case, someone has to take him outside since he shouldn't go unsupervised.", "NTA - The mental gymnastics people do in order to arrive at the point of outrage over the use of a single word is beyond me and why GF is so upset is also beyond me....", "NTA. \n\nIt was not intentional. he did not mean to break the vase and your son's grandmother even agrees his wellbeing is more important. Your baby daddy needs to understand shit happens.", "NTA. Presumably, your son's dad has his two year old son at his place on a fairly regular basis. So, my question is, what the hell was a glass vase doing anywhere that his toddler could knock it over? That's pretty basic for any child proofed house. What else hasn't he done to ensure his son's safety? \n\nYou're both lucky that your son wasn't hurt.", "NTA.  And it\u2019s such a trivial thing to have to argue about.\nI wouldn\u2019t want my child around the GF if she thinks this is a big deal.  I\u2019d be worried about how she treats him.", "NTA when a two year old breaks something, woopsies is an appropriate reaction", "NTA. The gf needs to grow up if she\u2019s that upset over a vase that isn\u2019t even hers.", "NTA, but honestly it doesn't take anything for people to become butthurt and offended.  Ooopsie, did I say that?", "NTA, this is the proper way to deal with a child when they make a mistake.", "NTA", "Nta. Did they expect you to scream at your son? It wasn\u2019t intentional", "NTA, the girlfriend does need to get over herself. Not her son, not her vase. Is he going to let her walk all over his son? If something this small evokes sick a response, what happens if something more serious happens? She needs to learn now, and he needs to set boundaries.", "NTA. If you have a 2 year old, you understand that everything is fair game and mistakes happen. It really sounds like they want to punish someone, anyone because no one taught them how to emotionally regulate. Don't react to them anymore and move on, even if they don't.", "NTA. Who truly gets that mad about a vase? Never understood that. And the son is 2, why have it around for it to be broken if it meant that much. Idc how extravangant or cool the vase looked, it\u2019s still a damn vase.", "I feel like I saw a similar post to this\u2026 it was about a child painting the wall of his father workplace at home to do like his mom do\u2026 of course mom says to him good job and didn\u2019t address the issue and dad was rightfully furious about it\u2026 well in this case, I give you a tentative YTA. If it\u2019s not such a big deal, excusing yourself about it shouldn\u2019t be difficult. While the grandma isn\u2019t concern about it and your initial reaction of calming your child while he was scared was the good one, considering his age, it\u2019s important in the futur to not make light of things like that. You can excuse yourself for this because at the end of the day in no world it\u2019s ok to just breaks stuff in someone else house and make light of it even by accident. And at the same time, his girlfriend is exaggerating. The kid 2. He can\u2019t speak world or understand a lot. If he was a little older, making him understand what he did was wrong and making him apologize would have been good. Not much you can do. Saying that they should glue it together and not wanting to apologize for it makes you a TA.\n\nEdit : I have a brain fart while reading this\u2026 I didn\u2019t understand that it happened at your ex house. Thought it was at his girlfriend. NTA for me now. Good call on reassuring the child, if the ex and his girlfriend are upset about it, you can snob his girlfriend but it\u2019s also your ex son. Weird reaction for him to act like this\u2026", "You most certainly ARE TA. Are you not teaching this child to behave? Two years old is plenty old enough to be taught these things. You need to apologize for not paying attention to your child and letting it happen in the first place. The least you could've done is offer to pay for a new one.", "YTA, it\u2019s not your home to make that call.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is very effective. You didn't do anything wrong. I'm not sure what they are asking you to apologise for? Parenting your child? Seems like they want a fight.", "God almighty these people are delicate.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your ex is reading WAY too much into your reaction.

They kept their China in a China cabinet with glass windows to \"display the China.\" The cabinet rested on the only hardwood floor in the house (besides the kitchen, but my mom was in there), which was in the dining room. \n\nWe were not allowed to throw balls in the house. With that being said, you know, \"kids are idiots,\" and we were no exception. We were bouncing a ball in the dining room, trying to bounce and hit each other. The ball hit the floor, ricocheted, bounced through the glass display window, and then did the bouncing thing between the two shelves to break all the dishes with more efficiency than even a human could produce. \n\nMy parents were less annoyed than you'd think, like we got a lecture again on the \"no balls in the house rule\" but generally they just kinda eye-rolled and were like \"probably should have seen this coming.\"", "You are right and wording on spot.", "Breaking somebody else's property is not a \"mistake\".", "I mean, it doesn\u2019t sound like the dad was watching him either and they were at his house.", "It is also the dad's child and they were at the dad's house.

If a guest in my home drops a teacup, I might be sad about it, because the teacups were my grandmother's. But I would try not to let the guest feel bad about it.

It was an accident because he's 2. Why was it in a space that he was allowed to run in? When you have a toddler, you move the breakables out of the toddler space.", "Also 2 year olds are fast and escape artists.  I work with them and yes they can break pretty much anything."]}
