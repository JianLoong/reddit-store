We were close growing up and have still been close until now but I haven't been able to see them for over 3 years because of the travel ban.\n\nAnyways, while I was there, I bought one of my cousins (he was the youngest of five and since the economy there is quite bad, he had mainly only gotten hand-me-downs) a pair of Air Jordans for RM 800 (approx USD$169) and a few days later, when I was about to fly back home, his older siblings wanted to buy me gifts on my way back.\n\nI insisted no and said there is no need for them to buy me anything as I had a great time there and I cannot accept gifts from them considering the horrible conversion rate they were receiving, anything for me would be too expensive for them (USD$1 = 4.73 RM). But they had actually bought a bunch of clothes and accessories for me while we were out in secret and somehow snuck them all in my luggage and I only found out about them when I got home.\n\nThere wasn't a receipt either but when I tallied everything up based on estimation, I estimated that they had given me RM 1000 worth of gift. I know they're financially stable. But when I thought about it, while those gifts are about USD$200 for me, they're easily spending RM 1000 and I just felt bad accepting it so I PayPal'ed their eldest sibling for the gifts and thanked them but said I couldn't accept it since it was a lot coming from them.\n\nHe ended up texting me back saying I was an AH for rejecting their good intentions and for \"indirectly calling them poor\" when that wasn't my intention at all. I told my mom about it and she agreed I was in the wrong for sending the money back as it came across that I was a snobby AH who looked down on their social status. Anyways I apologized to him and asked my grandmother to explain to them that it wasn't my intention to come across as snobby and explained my reasoning behind it and we're cool now but I'm just really puzzled if I was an AH for returning their money.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667280835, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yizwkt/aita_for_paying_my_cousins_back_for_a_gift_for_me/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a gift. It\u2019s their decision what they want to spend their money on. You\u2019re rude.", "Soft YTA\n\nI understand why you did return money to them but at the same time you just insulted them immensely.  That in itself was very rude, you should have just thanked them very much for the gifts and when it was someone's birthday send that person money and so on until you feel that you have given them enough back without them knowing.", "gentle YTA\n\nI understand feeling bad - the better response would have been to send them gifts or have something nice delivered as a thank you for hosting. Its never good to mix gifts and money, always ends poorly.\n\nBy sending them the monetary value back, it comes off as rejecting their kindness and generosity. And does imply that you think they're too poor to afford the things they chose to buy for you. Of course they'll be upset... wouldn't you be hurt if your cousin had hid enough money to cover the Jordans in your suitcase?", "I'm going NAH here actually, but leaning a little bit more on the Y T A side.\n\nI definitely relate to this, though. I always feel a bit weird when people spend money on me. Which puts me at odds with my dad, because he loves to spend money on me, even though he's not exactly the most well-off. I used to push against it (I'd much rather he just save it) but I've learned it's honestly better to just let it go. My dad just really enjoys giving gifts and feeling like he's able to provide for me. He's thought it through and decided that, to him, that money is worth spending. And at the end of the day, he's a grown man and can make his own decisions about how he wants to spend his money.\n\nThe same applies here, I think. You're not an AH per se, your intentions definitely seem pure, but you did mess up here and I think you should probably apologize. They did put you in an awkward position by buying you gifts when you didn't want them to, but once the gifts are bought it can come off as rude to refuse or refund them. (Edit; I'm realizing now that you did apologize and it sounds like the situation is resolved, but I do think apologizing was the right thing to do.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
