I have little to no support. Their father left after Cassie was born, no family nearby, etc. I have 2 sitters that I can call on as needed and I use them before I\u2019d ever ask Polly for help. I don\u2019t want her missing out on her teenage years. Before this incident, I only ever asked her to babysit once because I had no one else and I paid her $15/hr (at the time, above minimum wage). \n\nThis past Saturday, Polly was due to hang out with some friends. For a couple of days, Trevor was ill, but testing negative for Covid. That day, he spiked a very high fever and I had to take him to the ER. I asked Polly to watch Cassie as the sitters weren\u2019t responding. I apologized that she\u2019d have to miss out on time with friends but said I\u2019d pay her and she could even have her friends over our place. Polly pitched a fit and asked why I couldn\u2019t send Cassie to the neighbors. We don\u2019t know them. They moved in last month and outside waving when we get our mail, I don\u2019t have a relationship with them.  Polly was irritated. I told her I\u2019d pay her $18/hr and that I had to go. \n\nI take Trevor to the ER and we have to wait a bit. Polly kept asking if the sitters responded and they hadn\u2019t. Eventually it was our time to be seen, so I told Polly i\u2019d be out of reach for a bit. Turns out, Trevor had a bad case of RSV and due to pre-existing health problems, had to be admitted for the night. I was terrified.\n\nWhen I called Polly to update her, I heard people talking in the background and said \u201coh, you had your friends come over?\u201d She told me no, she dropped Cassie at the neighbor\u2019s and went out. I was furious. I told her to go home and get her sister. I then asked for the neighbor\u2019s number, she didn\u2019t even ask for it. Which, I get teenage logic but still. At first Polly refused until I told her she was grounded. I made her FaceTime me when she got home to show that Cassie was with her.\n\nEventually, my mom was able to make the 2 hour drive down to stay with the girls but I told her to not let Polly leave the house. The next day, Trevor and I were able to go home. I lectured Polly about what she did and grounded her for 2 weeks. She got mad at me and said that I can\u2019t expect her to drop her plans. I point out I never do, but this was an emergency and her brother was sick. She told me that\u2019s not her problem. She\u2019s also mad because I won\u2019t pay her. I apologized profusely to the neighbor who said it was okay and that he would\u2019ve called me but Polly didn\u2019t leave my number either. Polly said I overreacted.

She is a member of the family and has obligations to the family.  Your request was reasonable.  She was very irresponsible.  Grounding was an appropriate consequence.", "NTA. Polly wanted to go have fun with her friends during an emergency, neglected her little sister, put your neighbors in a difficult position, and then had the nerve to complain you didn\u2019t pay her. She has completely failed to understand how badly she messed up. You are absolutely right to ground her", "Tell her to ask her friends' moms what they think of what she did, since she doesn't seem too worried about what you think. NTA. Kids, man.", "NTA - I\u2019m mum to a 16yr old who babysits for his brother when we need him to. Occasionally being asked to participate in helping your family is an important part of growing up and learning to be a decent human being. I personally don\u2019t pay my son but he does get rewarded with treats, extra tv/gaming time or something he\u2019s asked for. We always tell him how much it\u2019s appreciated and his little brother loves spending time with him. Your daughter put her sister at huge risk, was selfish and continues to behave selfishly by refusing to see and acknowledge that she is in the wrong by putting her wants before her family\u2019s needs.", "NTA - Teenagers suck.   I am willing to bet that Polly still feels like the victim here.  It will be a few years before Polly even realizes how unreasonable she was here.  Hopefully she gets there as an adult.\n\n I feel for you and I hope you don't have to go through this again!", "NTA, as a 15 year old who also has teenage logic I feel she should get grounded atleast a month because you don\u2019t know those people and they could have hurt Cassie. Also I find it funny that she exp cried to be paid after leaving the kid with your neighbora", "NTA.\n\nYou are paying her AND said she could have friends over. That\u2019s pretty dang generous!", "NTA at all. You had a medical situation that needed to be taken care of. You offered to pay her and have her friends over. That still wasn't enough. She didn't care enough to make sure her sister was in good hands,. Wow, your daughter.", "NTA, families are small communities where people help each other, and that is an important lesson for life, helping people you care and love in an emergency is the minimum you can do.", "NTA. RSV is no joke, and your oldest behaved poorly on so many levels. In addition to grounding, Polly could apologize to the neighbors for placing them in this predicament, as well. Life lesson here.", "YTA childcare for your kids is your responsibility not hers they are your kids not hers great way to have her ever want to babysit again oh wait you\u2019ll just force her What are you going to do for emergencies after she moves out and goes to college?", "NTA \n\nPolly put her sister in danger by leaving her with strangers. She deserves to be grounded", "NTA\n\nYour daughter blew it! This was an emergency situation and her lack of empathy is astounding. But there had to be some previous interactions to let you know this.", "NTA\n\nWhile it sucks for your child that they got put in a scenario where they couldn't hang out with their friends in the manner they wanted to, that's life. You were willing to pay her for her time at a fair rate (though I think it should have been 20$/hr since she was losing her plans) and that should be enough + it was an emergency. \n\nShe can't get away with leaving your 8 year old daughter at a random neighbors house without knowing them. Leaving a number isn't good enough, that's how a kid gets abducted or assaulted. Its really dangerous, and for that she deserves to be grounded for awhile.", "NTA. I love it when kids tell me that something \"isn't their problem\". Uh wanna bet?", "NTA.  Normally, I'm on the side of \"not her kid, not her problem\" but it was an actual emergency and you explicitly told her not to leave her with the neighbors for an obviously good reason and she did it anyway.  \n\nThat's the groundable offense - doing something you explicitly told her not to.  If one of the sitters had responded, I'm sure it would have been no problem for her to wait for the sitter and then go out.", "NTA. I think two weeks is not enough of a punishment for this.", "NTA. She wasn't missing out on hanging out with her friends in the option you gave her, and I'm sure her friends would have understood had they known it was because of her brother being admitted to the hospital. Also, she intentionally entrusted her sibling's care with a neighbor you didn't know. To your point saying Polly said you overreacted, of course she's going to say that, she is the one that screwed up and is being punished.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA.\n\nYou are forcing your daughter to babysit.  Yes, you paid her;  but she didn't want to do it.   If you force someone to do something - and pay them - you are still forcing them to do it.\n\nYour daughter had plan.  There was a viable alternative.  You choose to ignore that alternative and punish your daughter (forcing her to cancel her plans).\n\nYou need to make a decision.  Do you want to have an adult relationship with your daughter once she is old enough to move out?  Or do you want her to go LC/NC?  This is the type of thing that is going to drive her away.  She had plans.  You forced her to look after siblings that are not her responsibility.\n\nWould you rather your daughter called CPS for child abandonment on you?   As that seems a bit like what you did.  You effectively left the kid with her their and said \"too bad\".", "NTA at all. It was an emergency situation, you apologized and told her you'd pay her for her time, and she not only ignored you but left your child with strangers. She absolutely deserves to be grounded.", "2 weeks is not nearly long enough. 2 months at least.", "NTA - Polly should consider herself lucky that she was only grounded for 2 weeks. I'd have done it for a month because she potentially placed her sister in great harm. Fortunately the neighbor wasn't a creep, but Polly needs a lesson in what strangers do to little kids because that thought didn't even cross her mind. Also she's very entitled. To say to you that her brother's illness wasn't her problem pretty much sums up what she thinks about the family and giving her an expensive iPhone, which I'm guessing she doesn't pay for, is one perk that should be used when \"paying her\". With my kids, I gave them cell phones so they could call or be reached but did not give them smart phones. If they wanted on they had to earn the money for it. Anyway, she needs a reality check.", "NTA", "NTA. You exhausted all other options,  offered compensation and a compromise (invite friends over) and it was an emergency. What Polly did was extremely extremely dangerous. I'm just glad her punishment was/is not carrying the guilt of something bad happening to her little sister because of her poor choices.", "NTA at all. She's 16, and you explained that this was an emergency. What a brat. She thought you were going to pay her after the neighbor and later your mother watched the youngest?! Pay her for what? She didn't babysit, she dumped her sister next-door.", "NTA. She didn't even care her brother was sick and had to go to hospital. 16 is old enough to know you doing  your best as a single parent. It's like this generation has no compassion for anyone else.", "NTA. Little Miss Polly has entered the try me if you want stage of being a teenager. No only does she not deserve to be paid, definitely deserves to be grounded, she shouldn\u2019t have a phone. \n\nI know you can\u2019t beat kids these days but WOW would by Mom have lit me up for that stunt. She needs to watch a film that outlines the dangers of what she did.", "NTA. I would be losing my shit if I heard this. That kid would be grounded until they graduate.", "NTA. You have only ever asked her to babysit once before, and this was an emergency situation. Not only that, but she left her sister with complete strangers (without any way for you to contact them or them to contact you on top of it all.) This is definitely open and shut in my opinion. Two weeks grounding is fair considering how serious the situation was. (Honestly, I would even lean towards longer, but that's just me and you already gave her a set time for it, so nothing to be done there.)", "NTA. This girl needs to learn how to work as a family unit. NO, she shouldn't lose all her precious teenage free time to babysitting her siblings. BUT she does need to learn that there may be a time when she is needed and should be present. She is being selfish as teenagers are. No matter what you have to teach her by standing your ground. That is how they learn. NTA. NTA. NTA.", "NTA I would ground her until she is 18 and then I will make her leave my house", "Holy shit NTA \nGood thing your neighbors happen to be decent people. That could\u2019ve been so, so bad.", "NTA\n\n\nWTF. I\u2019d be losing MY MIND if my eldest did that. Fear and shame.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a good mother taking care of all your kids and providing them a real nice environment.\n\nTeenagers are as we all know Teenagers ... and will eventually improve hopefully as they start understand things more.\n\nPolly was rightfully grounded.", "Wowowowowow NTA at all. Polly is\u2026 really something.", "Nta. You were wanting your daughter's help in an emergency. This isn't a case of a parent trying to make their older children into parents of the younger. Instead of helping your daughter dropped her 8 year old sister with someone you didn't know or trust - which could have had horrible consequences. I'd say you are being lenient by only grounding her for 2 weeks.", "Polly needs more time grounded and take her cell phone, computer and everything.. she goes to school and comes home!! She needs to understand what she did was out of pocket!! The fact that your unknown Neighbord had your 8 year child and she sees nothing wrong with this!! Na my mom would have whoop me to be honest!!", "Normally I\u2019d be up in arms about parentification based on your title, but no, you are NTA. This was about navigating a family emergency and Polly didn\u2019t want to be bothered. For a kid who has food, roof over her head, payment for when she babysits, and a phone - on top of everything else, she sounds entitled. Grounding her was appropriate! How amazing that your neighbor stepped up to help (at a time when she didn\u2019t have to). I hope your son recovers and that Polly learns how much you really give to her to understand how horrible her actions really were.", "NTA and honestly I\u2019d never be able to trust Polly again RSV can kill a kid so god forbid something happened to your son", "NTA. I\u2019m usually not a fan of forcing a child to watch their siblings, but in this instance you were being completely reasonable and doing what needed to be done. Your daughter deserves the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nBut part of her punishment should be watching documentaries on the dangers of trusting strangers or people you don't really know with your kids.\n\nEspecially ones that center around a teenager who dumped their siblings off on someone like that. \n\nIt would hopefully open her eyes to the dangers that she possibly put her sister in.\n\nShe obviously does not watch true crime stories or she never would have done that.\n\nShe was irresponsible, and deserves to be grounded.", "NTA, and holy shit. Polly needs to learn some responsibility. There is a massive chasm between you forcing her to babysit on a whim, which you say that you don\u2019t do, and needing her to help out in a family health emergency. Teenagers can be dumb and selfish but leaving your youngest with COMPLETE STRANGERS is mind boggling. Anything could have happened to Cassie while she was over there. And to not even leave a contact number for the weirdly obliging neighbour?", "NTA. You are not over reacting either. But your kid thought she was going to \"miss\" out on something. Remember that feeling? Maybe she asked her friends over and they declined, whatever the reason, she was wrong. Some day she will see what a good mom you are.", "NTA. \u201cPolly\u201d if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re a real brat and I hope you get yourself figured out.", "NTA\n\nYou were being perfectly reasonable and overly so in my opinion.

Let's get this out of the way.  There are a lot of posts on here about forcing teenagers to babysit and this is most definitely NOT one of those.\n\nThis was an extreme situation (emergency even) and Polly acted amazingly selfish and irresponsible.  She left a young child with strangers and exposed them to an unknown illness as an added bonus.  Also, considering how the folks around her were sick, it should be common courtesy/sense to not want to expose her friends as well.  She is old enough to fully comprehend how terrible and dangerous her actions were, but instead doubled down on being petulant. \n\nNot my kid, but Polly earned a hefty punishment and consequences.", "NTA.  Polly is acting incredibly entitled and selfish in this situation.  You even offered her compensation in this situation, which was more than you had to do.

She can only call and text.", "My point exactly this is what happens when you force her should she have called cps on her mom for child abandonment? What is this mom going to do for \u201ccrisis\u201d after she moves out and goes to college", "Not her responsibility for YOUR responsibility I\u2019m glad you learned it\u2019s never a good thing to force someone to babysit What if she would\u2019ve called cops for child abandonment on you YOUR crisis not hers", "Make her get a real job? I learned a lot more about responsibility to others, and consequences for fucking up, by having to work for other adults.", "Except she asked.  Teenager daughter said no.  And mom said \"too bad\" and left.   (at least, that's how the post read to me).", "I\u2019m sorry that happen! I hope that once everything calms down you can have an open and honest conversation with her and let her know how dangerous that was. I hope that she learns from this and matures.. unfortunately I wouldn\u2019t be trusting her with the kids anytime soon!!", "Well done, she needs to learn the lesson. Something could have happened to your 8yr daughter and Polly didn't even think about that", "Which unfortunately means she wins by acting horribly.  :(", ">They moved in last month and outside waving when we get our mail, I don\u2019t have a relationship with them.\n\nThat's what the OP says in her post. They moved in last month and they haven't met them yet. They are strangers.", "OP says they moved in a month ago and don't have a relationship. Sounds like strangers to me.", "Oh come on, u telling me that if one of your family members needed help during an emergency and u decide  going out with friends was more important? I really hope you don\u2019t need help during an emergency. Polly is selfish here.", "Oh, come on. Her kid needed to go to the ER. It's not like she forces Polly to babysit all the time.", "I hope you never need help in an emergency.", "You\u2019re right. I\u2019m lucky my daughter didn\u2019t call the cops on me for asking her to miss one night of hanging out with friends vs every other weekend she goes out. I\u2019m lucky she didn\u2019t go to the extreme of calling CPS on me and potentially getting herself and her siblings removed.\n\nThen she could be in the system and never get to go out or receive money to do so.\n\nYou\u2019re right, someone can CPS and have me taken away.", "I was putting this off until the summer as I want her to enjoy her free time but you\u2019re right. It can\u2019t wait.", "So 16 year olds should get to do whatever they want?\n\nDid you not have to do chores as a kid? Making your kid do things (within reason) is part of being a parent. Your argument is ridiculous", "I more read it as she asked polly to visit, stating there were no visitors available. Seems to me like one of those \"parents asking you to do something you are going to do whether you like it or not\", and then she apologized that Polly would miss hanging with her friends. I'm sorry, but if your little brother has to go to the hospital and you prioritize hanging with your friends over trying to help for a couple hours, YTA", "Heck, the neighbors on both sides of us (who were friends) sold their houses last spring and new people moved in last spring/summer. I've talked with each of the new owners once or twice in the past year and I'd still consider them \"strangers\" for the purposes of leaving a kid with them.", "Ignore this idiot. You made an extremely reasonable demand and asked your daughter to sacrifice something ONCE, and even added on two great benefits (bringing her friends over and being paid extra). You're an amazing mom doing your best and your oldest acted selfishly. Hopefully she changes and realizes the dire consequences her decisions could have had", "You clearly don\u2019t see the error in your way and there is no way I am going to convince you apparently actions don\u2019t speak louder than words go ahead and keep doing it and let me know how that works out for you you still haven\u2019t answered what your going to do when she moves out and is in college when another \u201ccrisis\u201d happens?", "I think you are saying that polly is the ah but the way you have posted it will be counted by the bot as op is", "I would want to thoroughly vet anyone watching my kid!", "I think that both OP and Polly are lucky that the new neighbor didn't call the cops after a strange kid was dumped on them and no contact information provided."]}
