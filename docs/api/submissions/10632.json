I have little to no support. Their father left after Cassie was born, no family nearby, etc. I have 2 sitters that I can call on as needed and I use them before I\u2019d ever ask Polly for help. I don\u2019t want her missing out on her teenage years. Before this incident, I only ever asked her to babysit once because I had no one else and I paid her $15/hr (at the time, above minimum wage). \n\nThis past Saturday, Polly was due to hang out with some friends. For a couple of days, Trevor was ill, but testing negative for Covid. That day, he spiked a very high fever and I had to take him to the ER. I asked Polly to watch Cassie as the sitters weren\u2019t responding. I apologized that she\u2019d have to miss out on time with friends but said I\u2019d pay her and she could even have her friends over our place. Polly pitched a fit and asked why I couldn\u2019t send Cassie to the neighbors. We don\u2019t know them. They moved in last month and outside waving when we get our mail, I don\u2019t have a relationship with them.  Polly was irritated. I told her I\u2019d pay her $18/hr and that I had to go. \n\nI take Trevor to the ER and we have to wait a bit. Polly kept asking if the sitters responded and they hadn\u2019t. Eventually it was our time to be seen, so I told Polly i\u2019d be out of reach for a bit. Turns out, Trevor had a bad case of RSV and due to pre-existing health problems, had to be admitted for the night. I was terrified.\n\nWhen I called Polly to update her, I heard people talking in the background and said \u201coh, you had your friends come over?\u201d She told me no, she dropped Cassie at the neighbor\u2019s and went out. I was furious. I told her to go home and get her sister. I then asked for the neighbor\u2019s number, she didn\u2019t even ask for it. Which, I get teenage logic but still. At first Polly refused until I told her she was grounded. I made her FaceTime me when she got home to show that Cassie was with her.\n\nEventually, my mom was able to make the 2 hour drive down to stay with the girls but I told her to not let Polly leave the house. The next day, Trevor and I were able to go home. I lectured Polly about what she did and grounded her for 2 weeks. She got mad at me and said that I can\u2019t expect her to drop her plans. I point out I never do, but this was an emergency and her brother was sick. She told me that\u2019s not her problem. She\u2019s also mad because I won\u2019t pay her. I apologized profusely to the neighbor who said it was okay and that he would\u2019ve called me but Polly didn\u2019t leave my number either. Polly said I overreacted.

She has completely failed to understand how badly she messed up. You are absolutely right to ground her", "Tell her to ask her friends' moms what they think of what she did, since she doesn't seem too worried about what you think. NTA. Kids, man.", "NTA - I\u2019m mum to a 16yr old who babysits for his brother when we need him to. Occasionally being asked to participate in helping your family is an important part of growing up and learning to be a decent human being. I personally don\u2019t pay my son but he does get rewarded with treats, extra tv/gaming time or something he\u2019s asked for. We always tell him how much it\u2019s appreciated and his little brother loves spending time with him. Your daughter put her sister at huge risk, was selfish and continues to behave selfishly by refusing to see and acknowledge that she is in the wrong by putting her wants before her family\u2019s needs.", "NTA - Teenagers suck.   I am willing to bet that Polly still feels like the victim here.  It will be a few years before Polly even realizes how unreasonable she was here.  Hopefully she gets there as an adult.\n\n I feel for you and I hope you don't have to go through this again!", "NTA, as a 15 year old who also has teenage logic I feel she should get grounded atleast a month because you don\u2019t know those people and they could have hurt Cassie. Also I find it funny that she exp cried to be paid after leaving the kid with your neighbora", "NTA.\n\nYou are paying her AND said she could have friends over. That\u2019s pretty dang generous!", "NTA at all. You had a medical situation that needed to be taken care of. You offered to pay her and have her friends over. That still wasn't enough. She didn't care enough to make sure her sister was in good hands,. Wow, your daughter.", "NTA, families are small communities where people help each other, and that is an important lesson for life, helping people you care and love in an emergency is the minimum you can do.", "NTA. RSV is no joke, and your oldest behaved poorly on so many levels. In addition to grounding, Polly could apologize to the neighbors for placing them in this predicament, as well. Life lesson here.", "YTA childcare for your kids is your responsibility not hers they are your kids not hers great way to have her ever want to babysit again oh wait you\u2019ll just force her What are you going to do for emergencies after she moves out and goes to college?", "NTA \n\nPolly put her sister in danger by leaving her with strangers.

You were willing to pay her for her time at a fair rate (though I think it should have been 20$/hr since she was losing her plans) and that should be enough + it was an emergency. \n\nShe can't get away with leaving your 8 year old daughter at a random neighbors house without knowing them. Leaving a number isn't good enough, that's how a kid gets abducted or assaulted. Its really dangerous, and for that she deserves to be grounded for awhile.", "NTA. I love it when kids tell me that something \"isn't their problem\". Uh wanna bet?", "NTA.  Normally, I'm on the side of \"not her kid, not her problem\" but it was an actual emergency and you explicitly told her not to leave her with the neighbors for an obviously good reason and she did it anyway.  \n\nThat's the groundable offense - doing something you explicitly told her not to.  If one of the sitters had responded, I'm sure it would have been no problem for her to wait for the sitter and then go out.", "NTA. I think two weeks is not enough of a punishment for this.", "NTA. She wasn't missing out on hanging out with her friends in the option you gave her, and I'm sure her friends would have understood had they known it was because of her brother being admitted to the hospital.

Yes, you paid her;  but she didn't want to do it.   If you force someone to do something - and pay them - you are still forcing them to do it.\n\nYour daughter had plan.  There was a viable alternative.  You choose to ignore that alternative and punish your daughter (forcing her to cancel her plans).\n\nYou need to make a decision.  Do you want to have an adult relationship with your daughter once she is old enough to move out?  Or do you want her to go LC/NC?  This is the type of thing that is going to drive her away.  She had plans.  You forced her to look after siblings that are not her responsibility.\n\nWould you rather your daughter called CPS for child abandonment on you?   As that seems a bit like what you did.  You effectively left the kid with her their and said \"too bad\".", "NTA at all.

She absolutely deserves to be grounded.", "2 weeks is not nearly long enough. 2 months at least.", "NTA - Polly should consider herself lucky that she was only grounded for 2 weeks. I'd have done it for a month because she potentially placed her sister in great harm. Fortunately the neighbor wasn't a creep, but Polly needs a lesson in what strangers do to little kids because that thought didn't even cross her mind. Also she's very entitled. To say to you that her brother's illness wasn't her problem pretty much sums up what she thinks about the family and giving her an expensive iPhone, which I'm guessing she doesn't pay for, is one perk that should be used when \"paying her\". With my kids, I gave them cell phones so they could call or be reached but did not give them smart phones. If they wanted on they had to earn the money for it. Anyway, she needs a reality check.", "NTA", "NTA. You exhausted all other options,  offered compensation and a compromise (invite friends over) and it was an emergency.

She didn't even care her brother was sick and had to go to hospital. 16 is old enough to know you doing  your best as a single parent.

You have only ever asked her to babysit once before, and this was an emergency situation. Not only that, but she left her sister with complete strangers (without any way for you to contact them or them to contact you on top of it all.) This is definitely open and shut in my opinion. Two weeks grounding is fair considering how serious the situation was. (Honestly, I would even lean towards longer, but that's just me and you already gave her a set time for it, so nothing to be done there.)", "NTA. This girl needs to learn how to work as a family unit. NO, she shouldn't lose all her precious teenage free time to babysitting her siblings. BUT she does need to learn that there may be a time when she is needed and should be present. She is being selfish as teenagers are. No matter what you have to teach her by standing your ground. That is how they learn. NTA. NTA. NTA.", "NTA I would ground her until she is 18 and then I will make her leave my house", "Holy shit NTA \nGood thing your neighbors happen to be decent people. That could\u2019ve been so, so bad.", "NTA\n\n\nWTF. I\u2019d be losing MY MIND if my eldest did that. Fear and shame.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a good mother taking care of all your kids and providing them a real nice environment.\n\nTeenagers are as we all know Teenagers ... and will eventually improve hopefully as they start understand things more.\n\nPolly was rightfully grounded.", "Wowowowowow NTA at all. Polly is\u2026 really something.", "Nta. You were wanting your daughter's help in an emergency. This isn't a case of a parent trying to make their older children into parents of the younger. Instead of helping your daughter dropped her 8 year old sister with someone you didn't know or trust - which could have had horrible consequences. I'd say you are being lenient by only grounding her for 2 weeks.", "Polly needs more time grounded and take her cell phone, computer and everything.. she goes to school and comes home!! She needs to understand what she did was out of pocket!! The fact that your unknown Neighbord had your 8 year child and she sees nothing wrong with this!! Na my mom would have whoop me to be honest!!", "Normally I\u2019d be up in arms about parentification based on your title, but no, you are NTA. This was about navigating a family emergency and Polly didn\u2019t want to be bothered. For a kid who has food, roof over her head, payment for when she babysits, and a phone - on top of everything else, she sounds entitled. Grounding her was appropriate! How amazing that your neighbor stepped up to help (at a time when she didn\u2019t have to). I hope your son recovers and that Polly learns how much you really give to her to understand how horrible her actions really were.", "NTA and honestly I\u2019d never be able to trust Polly again RSV can kill a kid so god forbid something happened to your son", "NTA. I\u2019m usually not a fan of forcing a child to watch their siblings, but in this instance you were being completely reasonable and doing what needed to be done. Your daughter deserves the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nBut part of her punishment should be watching documentaries on the dangers of trusting strangers or people you don't really know with your kids.\n\nEspecially ones that center around a teenager who dumped their siblings off on someone like that.\n\nIt would hopefully open her eyes to the dangers that she possibly put her sister in.\n\nShe obviously does not watch true crime stories or she never would have done that.\n\nShe was irresponsible, and deserves to be grounded.\n\nETA: Thank you for the awards", "NTA, and holy shit. Polly needs to learn some responsibility. There is a massive chasm between you forcing her to babysit on a whim, which you say that you don\u2019t do, and needing her to help out in a family health emergency. Teenagers can be dumb and selfish but leaving your youngest with COMPLETE STRANGERS is mind boggling. Anything could have happened to Cassie while she was over there. And to not even leave a contact number for the weirdly obliging neighbour?", "NTA. You are not over reacting either. But your kid thought she was going to \"miss\" out on something. Remember that feeling? Maybe she asked her friends over and they declined, whatever the reason, she was wrong. Some day she will see what a good mom you are.", "NTA. \u201cPolly\u201d if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re a real brat and I hope you get yourself figured out.", "NTA\n\nYou were being perfectly reasonable and overly so in my opinion.

Let's get this out of the way.  There are a lot of posts on here about forcing teenagers to babysit and this is most definitely NOT one of those.\n\nThis was an extreme situation (emergency even) and Polly acted amazingly selfish and irresponsible.  She left a young child with strangers and exposed them to an unknown illness as an added bonus.  Also, considering how the folks around her were sick, it should be common courtesy/sense to not want to expose her friends as well.

Let me break this down.\n\n1. Family emergencies are much more important than hanging out with friends. If my sibling was sick in the ER, I wouldn't be able to hang out with others because I would be anxious and worried the whole time. I'm baffled at the way she was able to just brush off Trevor's illness with no concern at all for her little brother.\n\n2. Honestly, if I had to watch my sibling due to an emergency, I wouldn't even ask to be paid, I would just tell my mom, \"Go take Trevor right now, I got Polly, you make sure he's okay! Don't worry about us!\" because that's what family does. This was only her second time babysitting ever, and it was only because the other sitters weren't picking up. The fact that she was going to be paid, especially $18/hr, is huge. Let's say she watches Cassie 6 hours (because we all know ER wait times), she's made over $100. Why the hell would she say no to that?\n\n3. You made a very reasonable compromise given the circumstances on top of already paying your daughter- she can invite her friends over. So she can have a girl's night with her friends while keeping an eye on Cassie (which would probably help Cassie too, since it would be good sister bonding time and distract Cassie from the fact her BROTHER is in the ER!), not miss out on her plans, and make $100 on top of all that. That's a super sweet set up (especially considering this was a family medical emergency situation!) and she's being incredibly selfish and acting like the world revolves around her.\n\n4. Don't even get me started on the neighbors thing. Yeah, your neighbors can seem pretty cool, give a little wave every now and then. What if they're not as chill as you think, especially considering no one in your family has ever talked to them? You don't know how safe their home is. They could have weapons not properly stored, they could have aggressive animals, they could be bad people (you know what I'm implying here). What if Cassie has allergies or food sensitivities? The neighbors don't know all of this. What if an emergency occurred with Cassie? They had no way to contact you and you had no way to contact them. That was extremely dangerous of Polly on so many levels and at 16, she 100% is old enough to know better but she simply didn't care. That is a terrifying thought.\n\nYou are not overreacting, you are NTA, and if anything, Polly needs to be punished SEVERELY. She not only disobeyed her very gracious and generous mother (which by the way, you didn't have to offer all the things you did, at 16 she is expected to obey her mother no matter what especially during an emergency), she put her sister in so much danger I can't even comprehend how she thought it was okay. She is lacking empathy, awareness, common sense, and caring for others. Polly needs a reality check NOW.", "NTA. It was a medical emergency for her brother,what empathy-lacking,entitled brat abandons her sister with strangers and demands pay for it?! I get teenagers do dumb shit,but she didn't even bother to cover her tracks,so she even thought she was doing a normal,human thing.", "NTA. \n\nIt was an emergency, you offered to pay, you offered for her friends to come over. And it's a rare occurrence. \n\nIt's not surprising that a 16 year old girl was angry and acted against your wishes. It's also not surprising that she would think you're an asshole. \n\nBut you're definitely NTA and if it were my kid, she'd be grounded a while for leaving her sister with strangers and going directly against what you said.", "NTA.  You don't know the neighbors at all.  That is a huge imposition to just dump a kid on people you don't know.  This could have ended so badly.  Polly needs to grow up.   FWIW I'd take away everything I could.\n\nNo phone. Oh well not my problem.  No ride oh well not my problem.  \n\nDon t want to act like family, won't be treated like family", "NTA in the slightest. \n\nYou sound like an amazing parent who is trying to juggle so many things at once . I think Polly needs to understand that you only asked her this one time as it was an emergency. \n\nAlso, I hope Trevor is feeling better soon. My two year old was in hospital overnight at the weekend due to RSV too as it was affecting his oxygen levels. Its a terrifying situation to be in so I couldn\u2019t imagine the stress you were feeling worrying about your sons health whilst also the worry of your child being left with someone unknown due to your teenager not thinking clearly", "NTA. These were extenuating circumstances- it was emergency. You compensate her. It\u2019s not a regular occurrence and you offered to have her friends over and apologized bc it was unavoidable \n\nNope she was acting like a jerk.", "NTA, this was an emergency situation and your daughter is old enough to understand that. You don\u2019t know the neighbor, she didn\u2019t leave any contact information with the neighbor, so many things could have happened. Definitely NTA", "NTA. You under reacted if anything.", "NTA by a long shot. Being grounded for 2 weeks is generous imo. Has this girl never seen a serial killer or kidnapper movie?? You can\u2019t just leave a CHILD with strangers, even if they live next to you! And especially without any way of contacting the neighbors? What if your neighbors were psychos or had sketchy friends over? I get that missing out on a hangout sucks, but holy cow family emergencies come first. She really lacks empathy and common sense, even for a teenager.", "I had plans with my BF in high school one weekend when my Dad accidentally cut off part of his finger.  So I stayed home to watch my little brothers while Mom took Dad to the hospital, and my BF hung out at our place and kept me company.\n\nI don't remember being the least bit resentful that I couldn't go out. I remember being very worried about my Dad.", "Nta yr daughter needs a wake up call. If anything had happened to her sister I really don't know how she would cope.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, kids have emergencies, and those emergencies disrupt plans. \n\nSecond, kids get their plans cancelled because of situations, just like adults. I remember missing a party because our car broke down, a baseball game because Nana was in the hospital, etc. and I had two parents and relatives close by. It happens. \n\nThird, Polly had basic plans, not like prom or something where if she missed it, she would lose out on a big moment. You also didn't brush off that she was having to cancel plans, you handled it with the appropriate apology and offer to pay her, and give an alternate way she could see her friends. \n\nAnd finally, this is how family is. It doesn't matter if you are a single mom or not, this could happen to any household (husband on a business trip, other kid has a test, whatever) and I assume Polly wants the benefits of being part of a family, so that means she has some responsibility as part of the family too. She also probably wants the benefits of being 16- staying up later, going out with friends- and that means the responsibilities of being 16 too, like being someone the adults can rely on. \n\nYou asked her to step up in an emergency, and she let you down, not just by saying no, but by leaving her sister in an unsafe situation with zero information. I get that kids shouldn't be \"parentified\" but that doesn't mean free of responsibility.", "NTA at all. You sound like a good mother, doing her best to be fair to all her kids. I\u2019ve been a teen not too long ago, this is completely unacceptable behaviour.

You gave her alternatives and she chose to do what she wanted and put you in a tough position.", "Does Polly give a care at all for her younger siblings? I mean, one was sick enough to be admitted to hospital and she abandoned the smallest one with strangers??? Grounding is not enough. Cassie could have come to harm. And Polly wanted to be PAID for abandoning her sister while youi dealt with a hospitalized child?? Polly sounds like she has no bond whatsoever with either you or her siblings at all. Do her friends know what she did in order to free herself up to visit with them?", "NTA. This was an emergency. You were literally taking uour other kid to the ER. She potentially endangered your other daughter by leavubg her with someone who is essentially a stranger and didnt even bother to get their phone number or give them yours. \nShe should be grounded and a conversation should be had about what could have happened to the youngest when she just left her with someone. \nThe fact that she had no concern or consideration for either sibling is worrisome. She disregarded her sister's safety and seemed completely uncaring of the fact that her brother was in the ER and had to be admitted overnight.", "NTA at all! Her plans were not something imperative to her life at the time. Your issue was an emergency. If she can\u2019t see the difference then she should be grounded. Next point, she left her sister with total strangers, did not get their number or give them yours. What would she have done had they disappeared with her sister? Or claim later that she didn\u2019t leave Cassie there and they didn\u2019t know where she was? This situation could have gone terribly! She has no idea the magnitude of what could have happened had you not taken your son to the ER and had the neighbors not been the nice people they appear to be. She could have lost both siblings. This is beyond teenage selfishness.", "NTA, the neighbors might be creeps.  Plus it must have been scary for your 8 year old daughter!", "NTA. Being grounded is a normal consequence for disrespectful and irresponsible behavior in one\u2019s teenage years. It is also a normal part of older sibling life to occasionally watch a younger sibling. This was a family emergency and Polly is part of the family.", "NTA and in fact very generous to offer to pay her during an emergency. You had to take your youngest to the hospital this is an emergency babysitting that shouldn\u2019t require payment or convincing. I understand her being upset if she was looking forward to her friends, but there was a much more serious situation going on that she should be able to see. You are in no way an AH here. Polly will come to see what she did wrong here.", "NTA. Anyone in this thread who tries to tell you otherwise is simply wrong.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t taking advantage and it was an extreme emergency. That\u2019s so scary! Thank god your neighbors are nice people.", "NTA, by a long shot. Your older daughter just showed how immature, irresponsible, and untrustworthy she is. You did not overreact in this situation. I know people say don't expect a level headed response from teenagers, but that is such a cop out. Is she that clueless to the risk she placed her little sister by leaving her with a stranger? Thankfully, it didn't end badly this time.", "Absolutely NTA. Polly is 16, so she is more than old enough to know how dangerous and irresponsible it was to leave her younger, vulnerable sibling with a stranger! 2 weeks of being grounded is more than justified, and quite frankly even a bit lenient in my opinion. Not only did she lie to you by omission, but she seriously endangered one of your children while there was a medical emergency already going on. I would have been absolutely livid with her.", "NTA. \"Your brother could have died.\" \"Not my problem.\" Disgusting.", "Sit her down, and give her 3-4 worse case scenarios about what could have happened to her little sister.

Then open up the internet and do a 1 mile radius search of your house and show her all the registered sex offenders.", "NTA Op. This is a good time for her to learn that the world doesn't revolve around her. She's old enough to know better. You gave her options to choose from and she still went out of her way to do something you explicitly told her not to do. I can't believe she doesn't understand she put her younger sister in an (potentially) incredibly dangerous situation. It was an emergency, and the fact that she retorded saying her own brother's sickness was not her problem really rubs me the wrong way.", "NTA. Her brother is super sick and even then she cares more about going out with her friends that she can do any other time again than being there to support her family? And bringing her little sister to people the whole family doesn't know is very crap, too.", "NTA. \nI hope your son is ok.", "NTA. It\u2019s literally the least your older daughter could do for her sister.", "NTA, OP. Polly screwed up and needs to learn that lesson before she hits adulthood. Hope your little one is ok.", "NTA and wow that is a horrifying lack of empathy for a kid as old at Polly is. Her brother being so sick that he has to spend the night in the hospital \u201cisn\u2019t her problem?\u201d Walk her through turning that logic around on her. If she\u2019s sick, why would you make her food or take care of her? It\u2019s not your problem, you\u2019re not sick.

Why should you and her siblings come to her sport events, recitals (whatever she does), they\u2019re not interested so why bother? Why get her presents on her birthday, Christmas, etc., it\u2019s just spending more money when she has all her necessities, and if she\u2019s upset that you don\u2019t, that\u2019s clearly her problem, not yours - doesn\u2019t affect you if you don\u2019t get her presents! Why should you ever go out of her way to do anything for her; I mean, her problems are HER problems, not yours. Parents are only legally required to do the bare minimum after all. \n\nYou gotta teach this kid what being in a family means, and how cold and unwelcoming the world is when everyone thinks only their problems or inconveniences matter.

No, she should not be paid since she didn't do what she was supposed to be doing.\n\nThis reminds me of the time I broke my finger while I had my boys with me (14 and 7).  The 7yo had behavior issues and I had no idea how long I would be gone, so I took both of them to the ER with me.

My first thought is to show her a map of local sex offenders, or offenders in a different city - no faces or specific crimes, but as a way to show that you simply don't *know* if someone is safe, and while your neighbor turned out to be a good person, neither of you had any way of knowing that.

She should be embarrassed by her behavior!", "NTA \n\nYour daughter is definitely TA. \n\nAlthough, to me the neighbour is also slightly at fault. \n\nWhy did the neighbour (the adult) agree to this? I would have never said yes to taking care of a child without the explicit permission of the parent. What kind of story did Polly spin to the neighbour? Why would a neighbour accept a child without phone numbers or way to contact the parent? This is also very strange to me.", "NTA. Your oldest sounds entitled and honestly a little sociopathic. Complete disregard for others.", "NTA!!!! \n\nA little anecdote: \nWhen my son was 16, I came down with the flu hard. I was fine in the morning and by the afternoon I was laying on the sofa staring at a wall, glassy-eyed. My son called an Uber and took me to urgent care, waited for me, and brought me home and put me to bed. When my husband came home sick later that day he drove him to and from urgent care, too. \n\nDespite only having his learners permit, he drove alone for the first time in his life to pick up prescriptions and soup for us and basically took care of us both until my prednisone kicked in. \n\nI had NO IDEA where this level of competency and maturity came from but when it was needed, he stepped up. \n\nI suspect something is not quite going right with Polly that goes beyond what you might be able to affect with the well-deserved and reasonable consequences you\u2019re now imposing. I don\u2019t know if you have considered therapy for her, but I think it would be worth looking into.", "NTA.

What's not normal is leaving her sister with a stranger....and she still expects to be paid!?!  She needs a wakeup call on just how much you do for her.

Perhaps there is something underlying that can explain this type of selfish thinking. It's more than teenager stuff. It could be entitlement, selfishness, or a lack of empathy.\n\nIt could be malicious or not understanding the urgency of the situation, the danger associated with the neighbors and the lack of love that type of behavior displays.

It will not serve her well to be self-centered like this in adulthood, which she is close to.\n\nGrounding is totally warranted here, A LENGTHY ONE, but she needs to understand and reason.

I want to chalk this up to her being a \"dumb teenager\" like I've seen in so many responses, but this just doesn't seem \"normal\" to me.

You were more than reasonable, even allowing her to still get in the social time AND paying her well. Her response is concerning and selfish.

Believe me, this will stick in her brain a lot longer than writing the apology will.\n\n Despite those who might be saying you're a bad mother, I think you're a very good mother in a very tough situation. You are struggling to do the best you can and your eldest daughter is not making it any easier. I wish you all the best as well as your children.", "While she\u2019s grounded, see if you can get her candy striper work in a children\u2019s hospital so she understands what happens to sick or abandoned children. \n\n\nShe has to understand her lack of compassion could have put either of her siblings in a situation of great bodily harm. \n\nNTA. But your kid\u2026sheesh.", "I think that she should donate her time at a battered women's shelter or with one of those big/little sister programs. Something that forces her to confront the awful reality that could be her life, and compare it to the life you give her. She'd learn responsibility and gratitude. If she doesn't come home within a month and thank you for all you do, I would get her into therapy.", "Ooooo. Ouch.", "Oof op she acts entitled because you let her. Two weeks isn\u2019t good enough. Be a better parent", "I think part of your daughters entitled behavior is bc you don\u2019t seem to ever expect anything of her. Giving her structure and rules should be a priority or else she\u2019s on a bad path for adulthood. You\u2019re so lucky CPS wasn\u2019t called. If I were that neighbor, with how you described it, I would have.", "Dang, what did your friend do to get this punishment? Breaking out the \"embarrassing your teenager\" punishment is like a declaration of war \ud83d\ude02", "The grounding needs to include the loss of all electronics except for school work, which should be monitored. Otherwise, she'll spend the entire 2 weeks on the computer/tablet/phone talking to her friends & playing games with them. Mom can get her a flip phone to use for emergencies.", "> Polly said I overreacted. AITA?\n\nI agree.  And she's still worried that Polly thinks she *overreacted*??  Frankly, Polly's opinion about anything regarding this situation is irrelevant.  Her judgement cannot be trusted.\n\nThe list of calamities that could have happened here is really high. And it's disturbing to see how little Polly regards the health of her brother.  WTH?\n\nStill, NTA except you really should be doing more to teach Polly why her behavior is so SO selfishly bad instead of worrying about what she thinks is fair.", "The extra shocking thing was that Polly still wanted to be paid, despite not doing the job", "If Polly was my kid, she would be grounded for months and months! This is borderline unforgivable!", "I\u2019ve done much less to be grounded for a week or two in my household. If I had done something like this I\u2019d be lucky to ever see the light of day again. (My parents are lovely people and I love them very much\u2026 just wanted to say that lol)", "Am I the only one thinking that 2 weeks grounding is generous? I would have grounded her until the end of the school year for putting her sister in danger like that!", "Not to mention she's complaining the mom didn't pay her, yet she offered $18/hr TO BABYSIT HER SIBLING. I didn't get any of that. I got told, \"Watch your brother\". NTA", "That\u2019s the part that gets me, how scary to get left at a stranger\u2019s house by your own sister! Poor Cassie", "I had RSV in my 40s. Because of previous health shit I almost ended up in the hospital. By the sheer blessings of someone or some entity I fought it off. But it was painful and took me out. This child is a brat and selfish. \nOP is clearly NTA.", "She made ALL the wrong decisions. Instead of right she went left. Instead of UP she went down. On and On. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe had options and chose poorly. Hopefully OP can get through to her how serious of a misstep this was.  A major misstep!!", "i think you should consider telling Polly what really could\u2019ve happened to her sister. life has real consequences, missing ONE night out with her friends isn\u2019t one of them, being molested is. NTA", "So kind of random thing I\u2019m going to throw out here, but there is an app (probably more than one) that\u2019s kind of like Uber, but for babysitters. These types of apps do background checks and that sort of thing. I know kids aren\u2019t animals, but I used to be a dog sitter on an app like that. \n\nAlso, NTA. I can\u2019t believe she just left her with a stranger like that\u2026 part of my young girl brain that still exists somewhere in there feels like there was a boy involved IMO.", "Wow, this makes what Polly did even *worse*. And your neighbors seem like really nice people.", "She could have just left her sister with some creepy predator. I'd take every damn thing she cares about. That's someone who is dangerously selfish.", "im just sharing a story i read in another comment by u / \rSnooPineapples6778 (spaced out not to ping) because I feel like your point cant be emphasized enough, \" My own little sister was raped at 9 years old because of my step sister doing the same damn thing...\"", "Shes 32 now with kids of her own she doesn't really remember it but i will never forget nor will i forget the pure joy i had when her sister was in the hospital with severe liver failure from all the booze and drugs dying at 19 nor my disappointment that such an evil person was able to get a transplant... Teenagers like this don't ever change they don't do better they get more entitled and become manipulative they exemplify the blight that is humanity and deserve no mercy", "I don't even know how I would punish my kid, but the punishment would be far more severe than 2 weeks of grounding.", "I had a resistant chest infection for months several years ago, constant hacking, and for me, I'd prefer it again to covid just because (for me personally) covid took so long to leave and I wasn't like physically sick, but I was in a different brain space for so long, it really screwed up my life. Plus I kept blacking out from heat or exertion. Or standing up fast.", "Honestly, they are lucky the neighbor isn\u2019t a mandated reporter. As a mandated reporter, my first thought reading this was that I would have had to call DCF. And that is honestly not one of the WORST things that could happen. The worst things are that her sister could be kidnapped, assaulted, or murdered. \n\nTeenagers make mistakes. Sometimes huge, ridiculous, stupid, life altering mistakes. She\u2019s incredibly lucky this didn\u2019t turn into a life altering mistake for her and your whole family. \n\nThere should be consequences, and Polly needs to 100%, truly understand what the actual risks were that she took so she understands that it\u2019s not just \u201cbecause I said so.\u201d The risk she took was real, and she is very lucky.", "This right here!!!!!", "Since you can\u2019t trust her to babysit, hire one of her friends, or better yet someone she doesn\u2019t like. And then pay them very well. When she needs or wants money for anything, tell her exactly how much you have paid others for babysitting and remind her that the money would have been in her pocket instead, if she had chosen to babysit her siblings.", "I think she's basically Perma grounded now.  Her actions showed a huge amount of irresponsibility. You can't just not trust her to watch her sister in an emergency, you can't trust her to drive to or from a party, or even attend if there might be drugs or alcohol. You can't trust her with anything. She has to prove to you that she can be trusted again. Curfew, supervised parties only, homework before socializing.  \n\nI have a larger age gap with my younger sibling than your oldest and I never particularly relished babysitting him either but I would never in a million years have left him with someone else even though we knew many of our neighbors.  \n\nIf she has car keys rn, no she doesn't", "I can't imagine having privileges like that while grounded. When I was grounded it was basically complete isolation except school or maybe my mom would be nice and let me go to the grocery store with her. The only thing I was allowed as entertainment was books... I ended up reading a *lot* \n\nOn the plus side it fostered a deep love of reading/literature.", "Yep, that's exactly what needs to happen. I wouldn't let her go anywhere unattended for at *least* 6 months. No running off with friends etc. I'm glad the neighbor turned out to be a nice guy but what she did was unbelievably irresponsible and fucking dangerous to boot. What if the neighbor *wasn't* a nice guy? I'd be hammering that into her head too. She isn't a little kid and is old enough to understand how horrific her actions could have ended", "Bonus points if the babysitter is younger than Polly.", "I'd give you an award if I could!  Great comment!", "As much as I agree we should parent-ize kids. I really think if OP leaned on Polly for help more often this might not have happened.\n\nBut the way OP tells it she might be a lost cause at this age."]}
