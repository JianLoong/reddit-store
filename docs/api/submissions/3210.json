My great uncle isn't liked by a lot of people in my family becuase he is really nice but in teh msot offensive way ever. He owns a very large home construction business and he'll often hire random homeless people he sees. He'll do something like give them 50 dollars and say \"here is money, here is my work's address. You will show up here tomorow and look presentable for a construction job. Stop being a lazy bum and do something productive for society and clean yourself up, you look like shit\" One time he was drunk and a girlscout asked if he wanted to buy her cookies and he said \"your cookies taste like shit, here's 100 dollars, never come back here again and go buy your uniforms or whatever you need.\" The thing that really hit a nerve with my family is that a lot of them are left wing poltiical activists and my uncle doesn't agree with them. We were at a Arbys and there were some mexican kids picking on some black kid for being gay and black or something. They were like 14-15 and he looks at my cousin who is the same age and he says \"go and stop them, be a man and stand up for him\", he didn't do anything and my uncle got really pissed and he goes up to the mexicans and starts screaming at them in spanish, (none of us knew he spoke spanish) and he tells them to get the fuck out of here, he was a bit scary. \n\nHe looks at me (i was 11 the time) and he says \"i believe you are a sheepdog, see your cousin, he is a sheep, he wont stand up to the wolves. We need to be raised to never pick on those who are different, and defend those who are weaker. I don't care if they're colored people, fairies (that was gay), women, retarded, crippled or whoever, you help them\" \n\nIt was that moment that everyone stopped inviting him. They were piossed at what he said. My uncle is in many ways out of touch and completely unaware its offensive to call people fairies retarded or colored but they really just didn't care. I was one of hte few people who kept a relationship with him. He was very nice to me. I just don't get it, yes he says offensive things but he's a very nice guy. He donates like 50% of his income to charity and doesn't brag about it.  \n\nAnyways i invited him to thanksgiving and everyone just assumed i wouldn't invite him for some reason. I'm not kidding, as soon as he showed up half the guests just walked away. They said im an asshole for ruining thanksgiving, they didn't listen to me ask them to come out, they just went to their cars and drove off. The rest of thanksgiving was alright , the remaining guests were nice.

That way they could have decided to make other plans for Thanksgiving. \n\nI usually think peoples' claims that other people \"ruined Christmas\" or \"ruined their birthday\" are a load of BS, but you really *did* \"ruin Thanksgiving\" for half your family.

I get where your family is coming from, truly, but I also think that mindset can be a big problem on the left. It\u2019s well intended, but it can be a problem.

If we intend to build a strong movement on the left we cant \u201ccancel\u201d and shun anybody who doesn\u2019t talk in a way that\u2019s PC. What he told you as a kid was \u201cuse your privilege to stand up for people of color, queer people, disabled people, women, and anybody who\u2019s marginalized\u201d and I think that a message that is fundamentally in alignment with left wing values. He just said it in a way that really really sucks \n\nThat\u2019s not to say language like that shouldn\u2019t be addressed! It should, he should definitely be corrected anytime he uses blatant slurs, but his values align, and that\u2019s important too. I wonder if \u201ccalling him in\u201d on some of these issues and having genuine conversations about it would make a difference with him. To act like he\u2019s \u201cthe enemy\u201d when in reality he\u2019s doing more to help marginalized folks than a lot of these chronically online keyboard social justice warriors is kinda silly imo.

You are not to blame for them being jerks. They make those choices. And they lose a valuable family connection in the process.

Many people think that just because they are big tippers or give someone money, that they are exempt from basic common decency.", "There are some people on this planet who genuinely don't realise that they're being insulting when they use non-pc language. This is very common amongst marginalised folk who have little access to education or internet communities.\n\nI am reasonably certain (as certain as I can be from reading a few one-sided paragraphs written by someone I don't know) that OP's uncle isn't in this category. He's rich enough to afford to bribe people to ignore his vile behaviour, so he's rich enough to spend a few minutes online educating himself. His supposedly being 'out-of-touch' is starting to look more like wilful ignorance right now.\n\nBesides, quite a lot of his cruel comments would be considered cruel by anyone with a functioning brain. 'Stop being a lazy bum' is never  going to be considered kind speech by anyone, ever, at all. \n\nAnd the incident with the girl scout? He's lucky the young lady was so gracious about his bad behaviour. Personally, if I was in her place, I would have tried to shove his $100 where the sun doesn't shine.\n\nSo he gives money to charity? So what? I do that, and I don't use cruel words or slurs while doing so. It's interesting that OP hasn't mentioned how much money their more liberal relatives donate per year: is that because they don't give, or because they don't behave so vilely that someone needs to make excuses for them?", "Using money to justify insulting people is awful. It\u2019s not just non pc language, he\u2019s actively insulting people", "Not letting other people who you know don\u2019t want to be around him and would absolutely make plans to go elsewhere if the knew he was coming makes YTA.  A gaping one.  Yes, you really messed up their thanksgivings and for some of them probably actually ruined it.  Having to change plans the day of a holiday doesn\u2019t leave a lot of options.", "Girl Scout: Hi Sir, would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies? We\u2019re raising money for my brownie troop and this is a fun and exciting time of the year for us.\n\nOP\u2019s Uncle: Your cookies taste like shit. Here\u2019s a hundred bucks to never come back here.", "I see a family that is upset because the uncle tried to teach a nephew how to stand up to racism and then called him a sheep because he didn\u2019t (his language is insanely offensive and he seems to have a white knight complex, but is that something to go NC over?). I think the uncle does sound out of touch and really difficult which is why I asked if it seems like he\u2019s evolved at all as it\u2019s been a long time since they\u2019ve been in touch, but it sounds to me like their ultimate  issue is surrounding the sheep convo and not the racist and insensitive language.\n\nI\u2019m clearly missing something!", "Let\u2019s be for real.  OP knew the others wouldn\u2019t have come if they knew he invited uncle.  I guess he thought everyone would figure, well, we\u2019re already here, might as well make the best of it.  Well, that didn\u2019t really work out, did it.", "I didn't fully expand on that. Basically for just going with his family excluding the uncle for however long they did previously. NTA for inviting him now.", "Then maybe these people could take on what ops uncle is saying \n\nHe's offering them jobs and money the things they want", "Because they are militant fake lefts as op states \n\nThe fact the uncle does everything op says I can guarantee is more than the other members of the family do\n\nFuck the fakes and represent the uncle", "I felt it was all of the things.  What I took away is that uncle is always unpleasant in what he says and how he presents\u2014-that he is always saying something offensive and people are just tired of dealing with it.", "Does OP get to decide for everyone else if uncle is good enough to be around or not? OP might not know the full story of his relationship with everyone in the family (or may not be completely honest with us about it). I mean, I have relatives that say someone we know is \u201ca good guy\u201d even though he was convicted of sexual assault (they insist the woman was lying about it). I think OP can invite anyone he wants, but is an AH for not telling everyone uncle was coming, especially if others in his family are NC with uncle.", "Ah I see, thank you for clarifications :)", "The things they NEED. I wonder how many homeless people would choose pity and a sandwich or a blunt(yes, maybe rude too) statement and a job opportunity? NTA.", "$50 for the day is so far less than minimum wage, let alone reasonable pay, it's insulting.", "I wouldn\u2019t want to be around uncle.  He sounds thoroughly unpleasant\u2014for a lot of reason.  If he were coming, I wouldn\u2019t be.  I think it\u2019s reasonable to want to know that ahead of time.  It\u2019s not fun or pleasant or enjoyable to spend holidays with people you really don\u2019t like.  Op\u2019s not an asshole for inviting him, but he is for not letting other people know he was coming when he knows they refuse to deal with him.", "I think that\u2019s a fair interpretation. I likely read in between the lines too much. I certainly don\u2019t condone the idea of enabling a racist relative and I\u2019ve cut off many relatives for this reason. \n\nI do want to know how long it\u2019s been since the convo when OP was 11. Has it been 7 years or 30? What has happened in that time span to make everyone in their family go 100% NC, has uncle evolved at all or is he still just as ignorant or even more ignorant as he has aged? Is he posting crazy stuff on fbook everyday and antagonizing relatives?", "I think communication about inviting the uncle  beforehand would have been reasonable and appropriate.", "Well when I was homeless and my partner if we got chucked \u00a350 and told to show up tomorrow we would of done it", "For someone desperate, $50 is like being handed a goldmine. Been there, done that. Thank God it's over.", "I thought the $50 was to clean up and show up presentable for a construction job, not the actual pay for the work they would do.", "He chucked them $50 and told them to get ready for work tomorrow \n\nThat suggests to me he would be paying them a day rate and the $50 was to make themselves presentable"]}
