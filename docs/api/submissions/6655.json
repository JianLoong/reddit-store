That is not racist that is just asking a simple question about their qualifications and see if you will be able to assist them", "NTA, in this context. If the last two employees they asked you to train didn't speak English well enough for you to be their trainer, it is fair to ask if the newest one does.", "NTA\n\nYou asked a question which is completely legitimate given the fact that previous two employees did not speak English.", "NTA.  A simple question should have gotten a simple answer.  There is nothing racist about this question.", "NTA. You asked a clarifying question related to your ability to do an assigned task.", "NTA.  You only asked because you were probably wondering if you would need help from a Spanish speaking employee again.", "Let's look at it this way.  If a job requires you to be proficient in any other language, you'd have to answer that question.  If your only language is English and you're set to train someone who doesn't speak English, there is a language barrier in place preventing you from doing your job.  Asking a simple question on if you can, in fact, do your job doesn't make you an asshole.  As a result, you're NTA.", "NTA. Context matters with this. If you saw a Hispanic looking woman and asked her if she spoke English because \"she didn't look like she did\" or some BS like that, that's racist. But if you live in an 85% Spanish speaking community and are regularly sent employees who don't speak English then it's a logical question and not racist in that context.", "NTA. Seems like a perfectly reasonable question.", "NTA - A basic necessity to train someone is to make sure you can communicate with them.  Given recent hires, this was a legitimate question.", "NTA in this context you just asked a question as it relates to your ability to successfully carry out your job.", "NTA based on your explanation of your workplace. I\u2019m surprised they were offended if they regularly hire employees who cannot speak English.", "NTA. You're asking a genuinely honest question based on your past experiences.\n\nStill, Spanish or English speaking country?", "NTA, you gave a reasonable explanation on why you asked and it makes sense.", "NTA. You even provided context as to why you asked, and that context is very clearly not racist, but a practical concern. \n\nMaybe if this kind of situation arises again say the context first? Like \u201cHello, most of my previous trainees didn\u2019t speak English, so I would like to check: do you speak English or Spanish?\u201d Kind of leave no room for people to have an assumption and the communication will go smoother", "NTA. \n\nIt's not racist to ask if someone speaks English if you're the one responsible for providing them with training. If the new hire doesn't speak English, you will need to schedule a staff member to do the training. Not a big deal, but you do need to know.", "Very NTA and, by no means racist.", "NTA.  Requiring a certain level of proficiency in any language for a job is perfectly reasonable.  How else are you supposed to know without asking or administering a test?", ">I asked if they knew English\n\nNAH, but it might be a little more neutral to word your question differently. There's a lot of social/cultural baggage attached to questions about language, a lot of people have faced discrimination related to people assuming they can't speak english because of their ethnicity or whatever. \n\nIf you asked \"what is their preferred/dominant language\" that I think wouldn't be taken in the same way, and would get your question across in a way that provokes fewer negative reactions from people.", "NTA.\n\nWhy is asking them if they speak English, given your previous experience and given that you have to train them yourself and you don't speak English, supposed to be insensitive?\n\nI am an ex-pat working in another country and I would never be offended to be asked if I speak the language of that country. In fact, I consider that I must speak it in order to understand people as much as possible.", "NTA. For me if you are asking because you want to be able to make sure that you\u2019ll be able to train them properly, I don\u2019t see how that could be seen as racist at all. If they are not able to speak English, then you can just tell your general manager and the other manager that either the Spanish-speaking manager, or one of the other Spanish-speaking employees can train that new hire.", "NTA, what you said wasn't anything personal or derogatory, but rather a simple question regarding communication.  I would suggest you watch your back.  I don't have a good sense this is going to end well, given they took immediate offense to a question regarding being able to effectively communicate with a trainee.", "NTA. You were coming at it from a logical standpoint.  If you can't communicate with someone, you can't train them effectively, if at all.  Having to pull someone from the kitchen to translate wastes your time, their time, and the new hire's time.  \n\nYou weren't looking at this in an \"Oh God, not another Hispanic person\" way, but as \"Can I realistically train this person if neither of us speaks the other's language?\".  The GM needs to realize what they're asking you to do is not going to work, and make other arrangements to train these new hires.", "NTA if that's exactly how that conversation went down, but by your own admission you're on the spectrum so is it possible you said it with more of a snappy tone because you'd previously had your time wasted because of them not taking care to properly match trainers and trainees?\n\nI'd advise just going back and making sure they understand, you have no issue with non-english speaking coworkers but it's not fair on THEM (the trainee) if they're poorly trained because of a language barrier, and you were only asking in order to make sure you're setting new employees up for the best chance at success by being trained by the better person. \n\nIt may also be worth asking if they'd support you taking additional spanish classes or something, it seems like if you've been there for 7 years and don't intend to leave anytime soon, it would definitely be helpful to increase your ability to communicate with new hires given 50% of your workforce don't speak english.", "NTA, but the question you asked *is* one that is often asked with racist intent.\n\nAnti-Latinx people often ask if someone \"even speaks English,\" as a slur against the person, with the implication being that they're too stupid to learn the language. It's understandable why they would jump there when you asked the question, even if that wasn't your intent.\n\nFor your own sake, it might be worth finding external resources to learn Spanish so that you won't have this problem in the future.", "NTA, they\u2019re uneducated", "Ehh, going to say NTA, but it's very possible that you delivered your question in an offensive way using tone of voice/body language, etc. Asking this question purely for informational purposes is one thing, but if it had an edge of 'don't make me deal with another one of those people who can't speak English' that's a different thing altogether.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Please think about your entire work history with this company and see if their reaction to you might be part of a pattern. If you're on the spectrum, it's possible that your work style is eccentric in some minor way and they don't like it. To be blunt, they may be looking for a way to get rid of you. First they keep hiring people that are difficult for you to train, and of course getting them trained properly is your responsibility. Now you've asked a reasonable question and they are jumping all over you. Make sure your resume is up to date, maybe take some extra Spanish lessons, and be ready to move on from this place. I don't think they appreciate you.", "NTA Because of the context. As you said, the last two people you were assigned to train you couldn't train. Thats the managers fault.", "NTA\n\nYour job hires multiple people who don't speak English. It's fair to assume that a new hire may not speak it and ask.", "NTA. It is not necessarily racist to ask if an employee speaks English, as it is important for communication in the workplace. However, it is important to be mindful of how your words and actions may be perceived by others, and to approach the situation with sensitivity and understanding. It sounds like your intention was not to be offensive or discriminatory, but rather to ensure that you would be able to effectively communicate with the new employee during their training. In the future, it may be helpful to phrase your question in a more sensitive way, such as \"Do you feel comfortable speaking English in the workplace?\" or \"Do you feel confident in your English language skills?\" This can help to avoid misunderstandings and offense.", "NTA they\u2019re being overly sensitive, but also that could just be them and now they\u2019ll view you in a diff light. I\u2019ve been in these situations before and they blow over pretty quickly you can tell when someone is racist and hiding it and when they\u2019re not", "Nta you wanted to know so you know if you'd physically be able to train them. No need to waste everyone's time, new hire included, if you can't communicate what you need to communicate.", "NTA\n\nUnless you were comically rude about it, like scowling and being really derisive. It makes logical sense to ask, since many people at your job -- including the last two people you tried to train! -- don't speak English.", "Seeing a lot of N T A s, but this is actually NAH. You're justified and so are they in being offended at first, since they didn't have any context.", "NTA, since you are supposed to be training them, given this is fast food industry the training would no doubt include both health & safety and food safety which you as trainer would need to ensure is both adequately communicated and understood.", "NTA. If they want to train folks who don\u2019t speak English but only speak Spanish then they should train them themselves. Having worked in the restaurant industry long ago, I had this issue where there was a gap in communication between our Spanish speaking crew and several of the non-Spanish speaking crew. I spoke a little Spanish so I could get by every now and again but there wasn\u2019t any reciprocation for the most part. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s racist to ask at all. I also think that immigrant communities (of which I am a part of) sometimes thing they don\u2019t have to learn the native language. This is much easier when you live in a community where you can get by without using English at all. I am from one such community and some people don\u2019t want to learn even after being here for 3-10 years. It\u2019s astounding. I don\u2019t think everyone needs to be completely fluent in English while living in an English speaking country, but being able to get by is a necessity imo. \n\nI constantly run into people from my community who still have no basic grasp of the English language and to me it seems disrespectful of a country and citizenry that almost universally accepts them in. I also understand that there may be different cases like elderly, people with disabilities, people that immigrated very recently. I have a family member who has been here for years and has been offered in person and online English lessons for free (they are available in every city I\u2019ve ever lived in) and still doesn\u2019t speak a lick of English.", "NTA. People get offended by everything, and the explanation you gave shows you weren't doing or saying anything offensive.

I'm sure your HR department will explain it to you.", "NTA - but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you hear from HR or are punished for saying it. People are too sensitive. You asked an important functional question", "English, I'm in the USA", "OP isn't even requiring them to have language proficiency in English they just want to know if they have enough English language proficiency for them to be the one training them.", "Asking that might not get the answer op wants tbh, because some of the people might be able to speak English well even if it's their second language.

Not that non English speaking people are uneducated. Oof", "I never said that so I\u2019ll clarify I think the staff is uneducated for calling him racist for asking a simple question. You should ask for clarification before jumping to conclusions.", "Would you ask the same question to a white person? No. Then guess what . . .", "Could go either way I guess. This is the internet, after all", "Thank you for the clarification.", "if the last two coworkers you were supposed to train in only spoke a European language you might", "Yes, I would ask the same question to a white person, if all the people they were asking me to train didn\u2019t speak the language I spoke. \n\nI would then suggest that they get trained by someone who spoke their native language if that was an option. \n\nWhat would be racist is for him to ask that people ONLY speak English at work. He isn\u2019t trying to limit them, he is asking if they speak his language so he can effectively train them.", "You\u2019re welcome AH", "No. No you mightn't.", "I don't disagree with your general point but Spanish is a european language.", "Maybe he's just shit at explaining things and it was faster and easier for them to explain in Spanish to each other and not involve him.", "So then you haven't actually asked a white person if they spoke English, have you?", "I mean, my cousin used to work with 50+% Polish immigrants, I think he very well might have asked his employer if his white coworkers spoke English.\n\nedit: But that's ok, you can keep ignorantly thinking that all white people speak English, that's fine for you.", "And if you have a bunch of white coworkers from Spain you might ask if they speak English.", "Maybe. Or maybe they just didn't have strong English skills. That's ok too.", "I have. You asked a hypothetical so I answered it hypothetically.", "So you acknowledge you don't even know how your cousin would have reacted . . . you're just guessing. LOL.", "You can't change the facts, though", "Are you saying you're sure how someone would react to a series of coworkers from Europe who don't speak English? Or are you just guessing too?  \n\nAsking if European immigrants from non-English speaking countries speak English after a series of coworkers don't speak English is an entirely plausible reason to ask if a white coworker speaks English.", "As to your first question, yes I am. Again, you can have your HR department explain it to you.", "> As to your first question, yes I am\n\nJust guessing? Yeah no shit. \n\n>you can have your HR department explain it to you.\n\nSo, you think HR doesn't want coworkers to know what language everyone speaks?  my work asked us to put the languages we speak on our name tags, but OK you keep insisting your assumptions are reality. That's fine. All white people speak english and knowing how to communicate to coworkers is racist. You keep that line of thinking up, kid.", "NTA but you might needed to have explained to your boss the context that your Spanish wasn't good enough to train them and a Spanish speaker would be more effective not that they should be speaking English in the workplace", "NTA - but I would get rid of those new employees. Just legal problems waiting to happen.", "NTA, as most have said, due to context.\n\nThere has been an increase in overt and/or violent racism in many countries recently, however, so for anyone who is not aware of your situation, they may automatically take offense without knowing what the situation is.\n\nTo protect yourself, and make sure your question is understood, it might be a good idea to give the reason FOR your question when you ask it.\n\nLike, for example, in the situation you were just in, you could say, 'the last two employees I was supposed to train didn't speak enough English for us to communicate well and I had to get help with their training from one of our spanish-speaking employees. Does this new hire speak enough English for me to train them alone? If not, I will need help from someone who speaks their language to train them.\"", "YTA for not learning spanish after 7 years of it being VERY relevant in your workplace.", "NTA. It also seems entirely reasonable to ask especially when you've had to ask another employee to do the training you were supposed to do, but couldn't due to the language barrier, therefore putting more of a workload on someone who wasn't anticipating it. \n\nYou shouldn't be asked to train employees that you cannot communicate with, that's literally something the manager asking you to do the training should be checking before choosing which employee would be a good option to train the new hire.", "NTA. I would expect that\u2019s a pretty common and standard question for new hires in most kitchens.\n\nSource: I\u2019ve worked in the industry for years (7+).", "NTA  \n\n\nif you are going to train somone you need to be able to communicate with them, but perhaps it might be time to start actively learning the language since you work around so many people that speak it, possibly as a primary language", "This was not insensitive, maybe a bit bluntly put but appropriate to ask in the context. NTA", "Happy Cake Day", "I don't think it'll escalate to that, I usually have a good work relationship with the other 2 managers involved.", "You're right, there are probably better ways to word the question, that was just something off the top of my head. Maybe asking what languages people have a working proficiency in? That way it doesn't matter what their first language is, just matters what languages they speak well enough to get by, which is really all that's needed in most work places.", "Yes, I think it may have been my tone. I usually have a pretty good work relationship with the 2 other managers involved, so I'm worried about that. Also I'm worried I may have offended others but they just haven't said anything to me.", ">What about communicating with customers?\n\nIf they're just working in the back that wouldn't be an issue", "> Isn't English necessary in the work place?\n\nIn many workplaces, no. In lots of agriculture industry jobs (in the USA), Spanish is the language that is necessary in the workplace, or sometimes even Tagalog.", "Agree. That's why I'm asking.", "Yea, I get that; but I'm talking in this specific context.\n\nBeing a restaurant, I would imagine it is necessary. Not that everybody has to speak it, but definitely needed to engage with customers.", "Unless they're line cooks?", "> Not that everybody has to speak it", " So.. that means it's not necessary? If they dont need it to work... it's not necessary to work...", "No one can\u2026 so?\n\nYou seem like a person in need of a purpose.", "Let's recap, because this should be simple.\n\n1. The place is a restaurant in the US.\n2. It is obvious it deals with English speaking customers.\n3. Not all the staff has to speak English, because not everyone has to deal with customers.\n4. But clearly, the language that isn't actually required at the workplace is Spanish, thus it's not expected the manager speaks this language.\n\nSo, it's baffling that OP's managers get offended simply because he asked if the new hire speaks English, let alone trying to turn it into a racist thing. OP's question is totally valid, and more importantly because he doesn't speak Spanish and is not a requirement.", "Perhaps I am. But, it doesn't change the fact that you can't change the facts.", "NTA - it is a reasonable question. Only racist if you asked it in front of the person", "sometimes it matters less what you meant compared to how you were understood. it can sometimes be difficult to anticipate if someone will interpret as offensive something you meant to be innocuous -- if you *can* anticipate it, it\u2019s good to front-load the clarification (e.g. \u201cI struggled to train the last two new hires due to a language barrier. Does this new hire speak English?\u201d). if you don\u2019t anticipate it and someone tells you they\u2019re offended, apologize politely, clarify what you meant, and apologize again (e.g. \u201cMy mistake, I was only concerned because of the difficulty I had training our previous hires who weren\u2019t fluent in English. I\u2019m sorry I offended you, I won\u2019t let it affect my performance with the new employee.\u201d) imo a misunderstanding like this is a NAH scenario", "NTA. Not everyone speaks English. If you're in a place where lots of people don't speak English, that's a totally legitimate question to open with.", "NTA", "NTA. You asked a question to clarify what the new employee can and cannot do. It's important info to have so you can plan accordingly. Take it from someone who has been in your shoes and had to train someone who doesn't speak the same language as you. It is incredibly difficult unless you are able to communicate in a common language or broken form of their language that is enough to get by. The only thing I can suggest is maybe wording it a little more tactfully, since people are overly sensitive of how language is used these days. Maybe say something along the lines of \"I'm not confident enough in my Spanish to be able to communicate what is needed to the fullest", "Maybe \"Is it okay if I speak English?\" It\u2019s a rephrasing that takes the onus off the listener."]}
