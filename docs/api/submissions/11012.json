They could have the chats another day. I wouldn't expect someone to come for them on a travel day.", "NTA. They were cool in that they picked you up from the airport, and they do deserve some nice time with you so they can hear about your trip, but you definitely need recovery time. They'll recover from this as well. Welcome back!", "NTA so hard\n\nYou're exhausted. You aren't in social mode.\n\nPersonally I always take an extra day off work to recover after a long trip", "NTA I understand that they're doing you a favour and probably are excited to see you again and talk about your trip.... but your health comes first. And after travelling like that, the first thing I'd want is my own bed and a few hours of silence.\n\nPerhaps if possible next time, give yourself a bit more margin in your schedule so that you have the next day off and can sleep for a while at your parents house before going home.", "NTA. I'm guessing that your parents don't do a lot of international travel \ud83d\ude06Make a date for a couple of days from now and ignore the sulking.", "NTA Your parents should be more understanding that you literally didn't have a wink of sleep and that you probably just want to head home, freshen up and sleep.   \nYou're NTA but your father is acting entitled.", "NTA.\n\nTake them to dinner or something for a proper catch up once you've rested up.", "NAH - Have they ever experienced jet lag or time zone changes? Be kind to them as well. They miss you and want to see you, and being Sunday realize it will likely be until next weekend before you can catch up.

Make it a priority to go over and talk about the trip, and give a short and polite apology for not being able to chat right when you got back. Put the ball in their court. If they can't forgive you for something they wasn't even wrong then that's on them. But an apology because you know it hurt their feelings isn't unwarranted just to keep the peace. :)", "NTA. Got tired just reading about 3 layovers. You can spend next saturday at your parents and talk for hours.", "When you asked your parents to pick you up from the airport, what plans did you make ?  Did you offer to buy them dinner to thank them for picking you up ?

Traveling especially if it doesn't go like planned is just stress. You also need to work next day, so you need to unpack your baggages, wash your used clothes...\n\nAnd to not bring your key if they pick you up is  as if they wanted to force you to stay with them and chat. As if taking it with them and then having a chat - if you want - in youf apartment, while doing laundry and so.", "NTA.  Traveling is exhausting.\n\n By the way, you mentioned a flying phobia (I have one too.)  Do you take anything for it?  Because some of those medications can also make you sleepy.", "NTA. They're ridiculous for not bringing your keys; if they wanted to sit and chat they needed to schedule that for another time or expect to chat at your place over takeout.", "NTA but you just learned a valuable lesson about travelling.  Keep at least 1 day to decompress before going back to work.", "NTA. Jetlag is a pain in the ass and definitely requires rest. I've had Transatlantic flights before and arrived back home to find that I've had to socialise with family or friends on that day and it's been a killer. I would've suggested promising to take the parents out for dinner at a later date as a thank you for the airport rides and to socialise when you've had some rest.", "NTA go LC on them.", "I'm sorry, I assumed they'd be dropping me straight at home, considering I'd been flying for over 24 hours. But I'll definitely offer dinner.", "A completely reasonable assumption, OP. It\u2019s kind of crazy to me that they would ever think otherwise."]}
