Our oldest moved out 3 years ago with her boyfriend, and got an appartment. They were together 4 years before that, so it wasn't like she ran off with some guy she just met. We supported her decision, she was old enough and working full time. \n\nThe issue is rent in our area has more than doubled on average since. Their landlord raised the rent 40% in the span of 3 months, and they couldn't afford to stay there anymore. The issue is they weren't exactly swimming in cash before that, they don't really have enough for first last and security with the market, not that there's much to but anyway in their price range.\n\nTheir plan was to move in with her boyfriends parents for a few months while they figured stuff out and saved up, but they won't let her come with. So they proposed an idea, she'd move back in with us, him with his parents, and they'd save up and be gone in 6 months tops. The issue is me and my husband don't feel that's appropriate. She's an adult now, and she needs to learn to take care of herself, not relying on handouts from her parents. She offered to pay rent, but we would only do that if she agreed to pay the market average plus her share of utilities, which would mean she couldn't save up like she wants to.\n\nBecause we aren't doing that, she's been force to share a 2 bed appartment with 6 other people, some of whom she finds \"sketchy\". I feel for her, but I still think it's her responsibility.

What's next, she loses her job because her company joins in on the layoff fun? This is not anything OP's daughter needs to hear.", "She\u2019s lucky the daughter calls at all!!!!", "Damn, I\u2019m not surprised they don\u2019t have close relationships with them. \n\nMy family is dysfunction as hell and at times our relationship has been awful but at least I\u2019ve always known I could go home if I needed to. Im baffled by how these people have justified this to themselves. Providing a roof over your children\u2019s head when they need it (regardless of age) is pretty basic.", "Right. Daughter- \u201cyou can move in with me, but you\u2019ll have to pay market value!\u201d", "I'm so sorry. Sending hugs.", "I hope you and your daughter are safe now and in a better place, very very very far from your abuser.  Sending you a virtual hug.", "Yeah it also looks like this person's a major YTA and also doing something illegal.", "Yikes... Poor kid", "Yes? For when he moves out, not when he's at home.", "I rarely \"make\" my child do anything. They are a functioning human with a brain and consider a lot of things. What part of my comment reads as if I made them do anything?\n\nAs I said, my child came up with their own plan based on a conversation which had nothing to do with either of us.", "My brother and I paid board as soon as we started earning, we weren\u2019t earning much so we weren\u2019t paying much but it was a contribution towards food etc. which we didn\u2019t mind paying. \n\nTurns out our parents were actually just saving that money for us for if there was something we really wanted to buy/do but it was a bit pricey then that money would be used. \n\nEven once we were no longer minors and were paying rent it wasn\u2019t extortionate it was a share of costs and we could pick up/trade off extra chores around the house for discount. Most of my holiday spending money for a couple of years came from doing my brothers\u2019 ironing. We had fixed rates for various things, 5 per load of ironing, 10 to hoover and dust the whole house, 5 for washing down the wood floors, 5 to clean the bathroom, 2.5 to cook a meal for the family.  I think the prices were based on how much our mother was willing to pay to not do each of those jobs.", "Thanks, I'm glad someone likes it, and we'll definitely go with their plan that they created *when* it becomes time to do so... \n\nbut as I've had to clarify multiple times, my 13 year old does not pay anything. They're 13. They go to school. \n\nIt's their plan for the vague future, lol", "Lol they will probably change their plan 100 times before they ever actually start working, but I thought the plan was pretty clever, tbh\n\nEdit: Also since *several* people seem too illiterate to comprehend the initial comment, disclaimer: I have never suggested my child consider rent. My child is 13 and sees just as much reddit posts in media as anyone here and knows that there is a housing crisis. I can't stop them from having a brain, jfc.", "Not my system! I'm not that creative.\n\nBut I do believe basically the only reasons parents should charge rent is like... if there's legit no way to pay the bills otherwise (and yes, I believe parents should get second jobs before relying on their kids), or if the kid wants to pay, or as a way of saving, so... \n\na grand a month! It's closer to $2k a month here... I think the average for something starter-style is $1700. Maybe we need to move LOL", "My point was that OP seemed desperate to make the daughter ... idk... whatever this is supposed to be:\n\n>She's an adult now, and she needs to learn to take care of herself, not relying on handouts from her parents\n\nAnd that \"paying rent\" into a savings might make OP feel like she *was* taking care of herself? But still allowing the daughter to save money.", "I find it distinctly odd when parents don't understand that they signed up for a lifelong commitment when they have kids. It's not something you \"retire\" from. \n\nIt's not like OP is saying \"she's a crack head who's stolen from us on multiple occasions.\" Or anything... That makes any kind of sense at all. \n\nIt feels like the daughter has been abandoned by everyone. Her own family won't take her in. Her boyfriend has moved back in with his family who won't take her in, instead of staying with her where maybe they'd have a better solution or at least he's there to help protect her. \n\nI don't know. I really feel for this kid. And yeah... To me she's still a pretty young person who I'd feel that kind of protectiveness over to call her a kid at her age compared to me and I bet I'm younger than her parents.", "What really gets me, is that there's no mention of trouble with the daughter. No reference to drugs, bad behavior... nothing. If that were a factor, there's no way OP would leave that out of the post .", "Sounds like my family, lol.  We may get pissed at each other, but at the end of the day, our family has _love_ and not every family I've been around feels that way.  It makes me sad, but also grateful that I was lucky enough to be born into my family.", "Thank you! I was able to purchase my first home a year later and she's thriving and lovely. Everything's really great now but this is OP's fate if they don't get their head out of their ass.", "Ya'll lack basic reading comprehension. My child does not pay rent, try again.", "Yeah, not interested in arguing with this person but super happy I\u2019m not their child, and I\u2019ve never moved in with my parents past 18 but have had some big struggles in which my parents offered me help, rent free.", "Getting a sum for what you do around the home seems reasonable. More reasonable than thinking a 13 year old can rationalize paying their living expenses to an actual parent at that age. Or even at 16", "Yep. And what a time to do this too, with layoffs happening in excess, the housing market imploding, and the fear of job loss in the back of everyone's minds.\n\nGreat time to be told your own mom can't bother to care about your housing or financial stability.", "Right? And she\u2019s been living on her own for three years. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s irresponsible or incapable. They just need some time to reset and save some cash.\n\nAlso, this seems to be happening a lot to people who started leases in early covid era. Landlords were renting out at super cheap rates in 2020, and now that economy is rebounding and regulations/restrictions have lifted, they\u2019re all jacking up rents.", "Wow! That's impressive! \ud83d\udc99", "People can\u2019t read, sounds like your 13yo is more clever than they are. \n\nSounds like a great plan. The only thing I would say is a 13yo maybe shouldn\u2019t worry _too_ much about money/the future yet so just make sure they\u2019re not hiding some kind of big anxiety (I was like this too)", "Or apparently her safety since one of the roommates is \"sketchy \".", "Yeah, tbh the anxiety thing is a concern. Kinda how the whole thing started, really. \n\nSo there was a bunch of homeless encampments cleared out by the city we live near, and the shelters got overwhelmed. So 13's school did a food drive to help out and we were talking about different ways they can (sometimes) help people get back on their feet, what a shelter is for, lots of stuff. \n\nNext thing I know, 13 has several notebook pages of a rent plan. Which is basically living here till they're 50, which is yknow... who knows what the market will look like at that point lol\n\nThere's just so much on any kind of media these days and the kids don't miss any of it. I think they are all a lil anxious"]}
