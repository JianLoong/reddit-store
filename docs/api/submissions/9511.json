Our oldest moved out 3 years ago with her boyfriend, and got an appartment. They were together 4 years before that, so it wasn't like she ran off with some guy she just met. We supported her decision, she was old enough and working full time. \n\nThe issue is rent in our area has more than doubled on average since. Their landlord raised the rent 40% in the span of 3 months, and they couldn't afford to stay there anymore. The issue is they weren't exactly swimming in cash before that, they don't really have enough for first last and security with the market, not that there's much to but anyway in their price range.\n\nTheir plan was to move in with her boyfriends parents for a few months while they figured stuff out and saved up, but they won't let her come with. So they proposed an idea, she'd move back in with us, him with his parents, and they'd save up and be gone in 6 months tops. The issue is me and my husband don't feel that's appropriate. She's an adult now, and she needs to learn to take care of herself, not relying on handouts from her parents. She offered to pay rent, but we would only do that if she agreed to pay the market average plus her share of utilities, which would mean she couldn't save up like she wants to.\n\nBecause we aren't doing that, she's been force to share a 2 bed appartment with 6 other people, some of whom she finds \"sketchy\". I feel for her, but I still think it's her responsibility. At this point she doesn't call much anymore and I'm worried this may have impacted our relationship.", "created_utc": 1675924648, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xnrhh/aita_for_not_letting_our_daughter_move_back_home/", "score": 5787, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's in a bad spot due to what sounds like no fault of her own, and you won't let her stay home for 6 months so now she's in a potentially dangerous situation with strangers all because you think she's too grown for handouts????

However... their plan was formed after hearing me talk about how some homeless shelters charge rent, some don't, and some have guests pay money into \"rent\" which is actually a savings they get back when they move out. So my child has specified that \"*that* is the only way parents should charge kids rent\".\n\nThey fully expect that to last through adulthood, until they've saved enough to move out with a year's expenses as security. \"Maybe even when I'm 50, I don't know\"... *unless* circumstances change and the bills can't be paid here without their contribution.\n\nSure, kiddo, you'll want to live here that long...\n\nAnyway...

I was even expected to cook dinner every night and fold 4 people\u2019s laundry every week. \n\nNO. You can\u2019t charge rent and expect me to be a free maid/childcare.", "Yes to me it sounded like the OP was charging full price for rent vs just a couple hundred bucks. The daughter may have stayed if it was only a smaller charge but it sounds like they wanted the price if she was living on her own completely.", "Rain, shine or shart", "The older my daughter got (she'snow 23), the less my ex communicated with her. He found loopholes in child support and emancipated her at 18....because \"she didn't send a formal invitation to her HS graduation\" and he \"had given her enough money.\" No birthday or Christmas cards since she was 16 or 17. 1 gift over the course of 7 or so years. He has said that she is on her own and won't help.  There are more examples, but I won't list them all.\n\nNo wonder she never contacts him. He's completely alienated her.\n\nLuckily my present husband adores my kid (he does refer to her as \"my daughter\" and has since she was 8 years old). He knows it's rough out there and our daughter will be living with us for quite a while. She is still in college and not making much money, but she does contribute to the household. She buys groceries. She cooks dinner a few times a week. She does other things to help while she hustles 3 part time jobs.\n\nI am so glad to hear that we're not the only ones who have no problems helping our kids when they genuinely need it.", "I appreciate this comment. I just can't connect with kids, and I always gravitated toward the older crowd when I was a kid myself. I've worried what that might mean for me as a parent, but this gives me hope that I will be fine in the long run", "Yes agreed, that just would not be at all appropriate for elderly adults to do!"]}
