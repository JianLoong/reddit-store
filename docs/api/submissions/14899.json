My friends younger sister (19F) has been joining us lately when we go out to try new restuarants. About 2 months ago she decided to go vegan. Of course there is nothing wrong with being vegan. But since then she has gotten very annoying when any of use order meals that aren't at least vegetarian. Everytime one of us orders something with meat she goes crazy, she says things like \"your eating an innocent creature,\" or \"that animal had a family.\" Usually my friend would just tell her to mind her own business. But this weekend things got worse. We went out to a new place that just opened in our area. 19F ordered a salad, as this is a steakhouse sort of restaurant and doesn't have many options for vegans. I ordered a steak and my friend ordered chicken. After a few minutes of waiting the waitress came to the table with 3 salads. We reminded her of what we ordered and she gave us all a weird look and pointed to 19F, saying, \"but she came and told me you changed your minds and ordered the salads instead.\" It turns out when she had gotten up to go to the bathroom she found the waitress and changed our orders. We didn't have the time to reorder so we decided to eat the salads. When we got to the car I told 19F that she wouldn't be welcome to come out to eat anymore with us, her sister agreed with me. When we dropped her off at home she went to her mom about it. Her mom told us that we should give her another chance and we are being assholes for not wanting her to tag along anymore. Her sister and a I had previously decided that we were going to cut back on taking her with us even before she became vegan because she has an issue with interrupting and there have been multiple occasions where she has ordered things that are very expense which means it is unfair when we split the bill three ways. She also stole her sisters ID once and tried to order alcohol, (I wasnt present when this happened). So what do yall think, AITA?", "created_utc": 1681597882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nl7jz/aita_for_upsetting_my_friends_vegan_sister/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is BS behavior, and I doubt her mother got the full story when she was told.\n\nIn what world would anyone think that someone who constantly tries to make you feel bad, and escalated to changing your orders secretly is not TA.\n\nHonestly, I would have reordered and waited as long as it took out of pure spite at that point. Then order more to go.", "NTA. If she wants people to respect her eating choices, then she needs to respect yours.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with being vegan\u2026until it turns you into a militant dietary-jihadist.

Of course she has disqualified herself as a restaurant companion for you and your friend. I think she probably did that already even before the salad stunt. What a brat. NTA", "NTA. There is one asshattery asshole in this story and she is 19z", "NTA you don't need a reason not hang out with this girl.", "I\u2019m not even sure why you need to post this question.  There is NOTHING you need to feel guilty about.  You\u2019ve been overly accommodating to the sister.   If I was you, i would have refused the mean and get the sister to pay.\n\nClearly NTA", "NTA. Tell her mom that you understand her impulse to step in for her baby, but that the kid needs to learn to navigate social situations for herself as an adult. Examples of that navigation that you should tell her mom about explicitly include not stealing others\u2019 ID to try and buy alcohol underage, not taking financial advantage of others by ordering very expensive food when splitting the bill, not altering other people\u2019s orders behind their back without their agreement, and not making rude comments at the table about what others are eating. Tell mom that at some point in a couple of years when she\u2019s old enough to drink so there\u2019s no risk of ID theft, you\u2019ll be willing to take the risk of inviting her along again - provided in the meantime she apologised and shows by her behaviour on other occasions that she\u2019s not going to keep on the same behaviours. If she wants to call mommy about this, tell mommy about what she\u2019s actually been doing.\n\nAnd then just be cheerful about the answer being no. You and your friend are adults. Hell, the kid is technically a legal adult. Mom doesn\u2019t get to make decisions about playdates and you don\u2019t have to talk to mom about it.", "NTA\n\nIf this happened to me, I'd be livid.  My wife would have to hold me back* and I wouldn't want to eat anymore.\n\n*Actually, my wife would be joining me in telling off the person who did that to us.\n\nAt any rate, yeah.  Your friend's sister shouldn't be invited any longer for pulling that stunt.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to be around that either. What is up with people splitting bills equally though instead of each person just paying for what they consumed? The tip is the only thing to be split equally.", "NTA, that was incredibly disrespectful and controlling. It does not even sound like she is very apologetic. You are right to not go to any more dinners with her and their family dynamic is not your responsiblity. Your friend and your sister can hang out on other occasions that do not include you.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to choose the people you hang out with, and you don't want to be around her.  She crossed a line by changing the orders at the restaurant.", "100%Nta, nope she\ud83d\udc4f should\ud83d\udc4f respect \ud83d\udc4fyour\ud83d\udc4f food\ud83d\udc4f choices\ud83d\udc4f like \ud83d\udc4fyou\ud83d\udc4f respect\ud83d\udc4f hers \ud83d\udc4fperiod, because her and people like her behavior is the reason why people who are vegan get a bad rep, do to them pulling stunts like this, you and your friends are nta and honestly your friend should ask their mom exactly what the sister said happened, because people with common sense would not think the sister's behavior was acceptable in anyway.", "She sounds a bit emotionally unstable. She\u2019s old enough to make ballzy decisions yet fragile enough where she still expects her mommy to fight her battles. I would decline to hang with her.", "NTA. Vegans are a nasty and crazy cult.\n\nYour decision to stop associating with her is the correct one.", "NTA. Any dietary choices (except allergy related) are a personal choice, and should not be forced on others. Even if she had changed your order to another meat meal, she would still be the ahole for changing your order", "NTA I\u2019d have left her to pay for the bill since she was so keen to order for you both. If she was your friends 14/15 yo sister I\u2019d be more understanding of the behaviour as she would be a child but shes 19! No excuse for it", "NTA.

Screw that, you're 24.\n\nI would have gotten up from the table (salad untouched) and told her to find her own way home.", "NTA Little Miss Vegan needs to mind her own damn business. Stop taking her with you.", "NTA. You're all adults, the mother shouldn't be telling you what to do and what not, only suggest, but since she decided to be a part of this issue, it will only be fair of you two to inform her of all the chances you gave the sister for the things the she did to you or while being with you that were not acceptable and all valid reasons for both of you to not want her with you when you go out to eat. This wasn't the first time she created a problem for your when going out, but hopefully it will be the last.", "easy NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She pays for your meat meals next outing.\n\nShe forced her choices on you, she owes you a steak and a chicken meal.", "First off NTA  little sister has terrible manners and changing your dinner order really crossed a line.  Tell mom that she's already had more than enough chances and she is no longer welcome to dine with you because of her atrocious manners.", "NTA - I hope you made her pay for the whole meal that she messed up. If she doesn\u2019t want to eat meat that\u2019s her choice but it\u2019s your choice not to invite her out.", "NTA. Too bad you didn't think to stick her with the check for your salad and order the steak to take home.", "NTA: that girl is young and dumb.A lot of her faux pas can be chalked up to being young. This is how she will learn.\n\nHer reaction to change your order is completely out of line.", "NTA\n\nNo way would I deal with someone who decided to change my order because my choice to eat meat offended them.    I would have let her have it at the restaurant and said, nope, I ordered a steak.  Not rabbit food.  \n\nBesides, She is 19.  Far too many places she can\u2019t go.", "This. All the vegans and vegetarians in my life are polite and you probably wouldn't even know they were unless you asked. \n\nPeople like this are just the worst and are probably only vegan because they want to be self-righteous about SOMETHING. If it wasn't this it would be something else.", "This!!! I'm really wondering why the server didn't stop back by the table to confirm orders.", "Before her sister started coming with\nus we used to do the system of, I pay this time, you pay next time. But neither of use really have the money to pay a 100 dollar bill each week when her sister joins, and her sister doesn't have enough money to pay for our meals either, because her mom usually gives her some money to go out with use, she is unemployed. So splitting it three ways kept everyone happy for a while, up until recently. We used to all order things within the same price range between 15 and 25 dollars usually. But about a month ago we went out to a nicer restaurant and her sister ordered 150 dollars worth of appetizers, entries, and desserts, the bill ended up being 210 dollars, plus the tip. She didn't even eat all of it, she just wanted to \"try\" everything on the vegan menu. Her sister scolded her and ended up paying for their food while I payed for mine. Apparently her parents usually cater to her wants so it is not abnormal for her to splurge.", "She doesnt come out ever again then"]}
