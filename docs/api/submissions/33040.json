Your financial problems are just that, yours.  You and your husband put yourselves in this scenario and to say that your IL's should be responsible for some of it is out of line.  Raise their rent to properly compensate and stop thinking that they are going to be the solution to your problems.  However you were raised is irrelevant now because your husband and you children are not the same people from the family that raised you.

Why would you put your kids in their care?  They don\u2019t have to be there, but they also don\u2019t owe you their time to be babysitters. Send them back to school where they will develop and grow, rather than being stunted at home.", "INFO: have you even asked them or you are putting the ultimatum even before you know what their answer will be?\n\nHow will them getting out of your property solve your financial issues?", "Why do you trust them with three kids with needs?\n\nYou should pressure your husband to deal with them if they're your inlaws.\n\nTell him it doesn't have to be right away, but some kind of clock has to start ticking.", "I think these are two separate issues: the in-laws staying on your property + your family\u2019s finances and schooling. It seems like you\u2019re combining them to try to solve an unrelated problem. \n\nIn terms of the in-laws: NTA for wanting them off your property. You gave them a place to crash while it was needed, but they\u2019ve overstayed their welcome. They should not have retired if they didn\u2019t have a stable home. You\u2019d be justified in telling them that they need to leave. \n\nIn terms of your work/school situation: it sounds like you made a decision to quit your job and homeschool without fully understanding the financial consequences. Being a SAHM / homeschooler is great if you can afford it. If you can\u2019t, then it seems like you either need a remote job where you can do both, or to go back to traditional work. \n\nYou\u2019re using the situation with your in-laws staying with you to justify asking them to homeschool your kids, and YTA for that. It\u2019s not what they agreed to, and honestly does not sound like a great idea. Are they teachers by trade? If not, it\u2019s likely they won\u2019t do a good job, and your kids would be better off in a traditional school anyways.", "YTA. First of all, what services are your children receiving from their virtual school? All three are at an age where services can assist them not only with schooling but also as they become adults. Are your in-laws even able to educate three young children all day long in a virtual school environment? At their ages they don't need someone to simply watch them, they need someone sitting with them and educating them on the content. \n\nThem becoming unpaid teachers, nannies, and house keepers was not part of the agreement. If you need to go back to work then your kids need to go back to school. And your in-laws and you and your husband can come up with an additional agreement for rent or perhaps helping with some tasks around the home and watching the kids before and after school.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you feel taken advantage of, ask them to leave. If you don't like how your property looks and you want your land and privacy back, ask them to leave. But don't use them not babysitting your kids every day as an excuse. It will cause an unnecessary amount of conflict and very likely make your kids feel guilty and like this is their fault.\n\nWatching kids every day AND helping with their schooling is no small task. It's a huge job, and one that takes a special skillset to manage. Especially kids with special needs! So it isn't crazy if your in-laws aren't up to the task. Also, you seem to believe your in-laws aren't terribly responsible, so why are you wanting to entrust your kids' education to them? \n\nSo like I said, if you want them to leave, tell them to leave. But do not base it off of their willingness or ability to babysit for you.", "Tell your mooching IL's to get off their backsides and help or or leave.  Period.  Don't negotiate, just tell them.  NTA.", "Info:  Are you expecting them to do virtual school with these kids?", "Dude, sounds like you've got a legit situation on your hands with these in-laws. Can't even imagine having them park their RV and make a garden on my property without asking. And only paying $200/month? That ain\u2019t gonna cut it, especially if they're not helping out with anything else. They need to step up or pack up their little camper wagon thingy ASAP. NTA \ud83d\udc4a", "Sounds like they're freeloading off of you and your husband. Maybe it's time for them to find a new place to park their trailer, eh?", "I think you're confusing the issues. You need to make them pay rent. Real rent along with utilities. At minimum, you should ask $1000 a month. You can offer to let them 'work' off their rent by babysitting, but if they pay rent, you don't have to go to work and can continue to help your children, which I'm betting is the better option since you're help will be actually helpful to the kids. NTA", "YTA, sounds like you're letting your in-laws take advantage of you and not pulling your weight. Get a job or stop complaining.", "ESH.....\n\nPerhaps it is time to start charging them to actually park their RV there since they are living there for free and also advise MIL that you don't want gardens or changes made without checking with you first.    They are taking advantage by not paying rent.\n\nThe inlaws aren't responsible for your financial situation.  That was created by you choosing to give up work and virtual school your kids.", "Info: is there a reason they NEED to be homeschooled? It's a lot of hard work that I don't think parents understand when they make that choice. Your IL's are not teachers and should not be expected to teach your three kids. They should be contributing more bc they're living on your property, but they are not educators.", "ESH and now you know why none of the other kids wanted them.  You could look up standard costs for mobile home lot rental in your area and have them sign the standard 3-month lease for mobile home lot rental at maybe $50 below the standard rate.  That would allow you to buy groceries.  It would cost them a lot to move that fifth wheel and then pay security deposit and last month's rent at a professional RV park, so paying even the standard rate would save them money.  I agree with other commenters that you are mixing the two separate issues of children's needs and mooching in-laws together in unproductive ways.  Do public schools in your area not have IEP's and support for your kids?", "Have you asked them if they will help without giving the ultimatum?", "INFO: Are you also buying groceries for your in-laws and do the cooking for them so they eat with you?  Or do they purchase and cook their own food?", "You can ask them to help watch, but asking them to take over the job of helping them through school is too much in my opinion. Are they even adequately prepared to help them through the coursework? Have you asked them to help in general or just kept silent until you\u2019re ready to blow a gasket? When MIL started building a garden, why didn\u2019t you ask questions and intervene?\n\nIf they leave, by my count you\u2019re down $200 regardless, and still no one to watch the kids.", "The only obligation that they should feel, in my opinion, is financially helping to cover the increase in expenses that occurs with them there. Treating your property as their own shouldn\u2019t have ever happened. Should ask before doing. You can undo what you think is trashy but be willing to take their reaction and your husband\u2019s if he hasn\u2019t approved jointly with you. No, I don\u2019t think they are obligated at this point in life to help with any children unless they want to do so. Likely they raised theirs themselves. Looks like no plan from get go of having them for x amount of time and funding a new place. So it will be difficult to get them elsewhere. Guessing no zoning laws restricting how long their rv can stay there. Or authorities haven\u2019t noticed a residence has set up in your yard.", "YTA. You sound bitter that the ILs aren't going to be your unpaid tutor/nannies, but that wasn't the agreement and it's not a reasonable request. Your husband feels the same. And their leaving wouldn't really make your financial situation easier. \n\nDon't blame the ILs for your frustration. Maybe it's time to shift back to brick & mortar schooling so you can go back to work for a while. See if the time with extra attention makes a difference for your kids. See if maybe your part-time work and then your assistance with their homework after school could work for your kids.", "I don\u2019t imagine granny and grandpa could virtual school 3 high needs kids. They should certainly step up to help financially though", "I agree with you. Also it\u2019s a bit rich for OP to be throwing stones about the in-laws financials when OP and husband made a decision so bad they can barely afford groceries twice a month.", "I agree with this take. \n\nThere are several separate issue that the OP is trying to bring together in one. \n\nIf the parents being on the property is creating a financial strain, then they need to pay more or leave. \n\nNo one is required to do free labor, and the cost of hiring a tutor/baby sitter for multiple special needs children is much more than any camp site rent I've ever seen. \n\nThe values are not equitable. \n\nOP is behaving very entitled, \"you won't let me use you so leave\" is just not a good look.\n\nMy kids are all ND. And yes hubs and I worked opposite shifts for years. 20+ and we are still going strong. Was it easy, nope, but life rarely is. \n\nOur kids, our responsibility, and we were very greatful when family did give us a night off.", "She\u2019s paying double water and electricity and only receiving 200. Sounds like she\u2019s  subsidizing them and is out of pocket.", "My guess is they made the decision before costs started to rise as much as they have. Inflation is a bitch and the added annoyance of the in laws presence and additional costs is making them an easy target for the ire. \n\nI don\u2019t disagree that these are two separate issues though.", "I thought the same exact thing! They made a bad financial decision and now want the in-laws to pay for it.", "Don\u2019t think a trailer would actually double the price of power and wayer", "I agree to an extent (an extra two people isn\u2019t double water and electricity, and depending on where they live we have no idea how costly that is), but their leaving isn\u2019t going to fix the major issue that OP and husband didn\u2019t think through their plan of quitting her job and doing virtual learning with the children. They can barely buy groceries twice a month. If the in laws leave, it\u2019s still not likely going to give OP and husband enough extra money to handle another emergency situation (car breaking down, a major appliance biting the dust, etc).\n\nOP can want the in laws to go, but the fact that she\u2019s let this build up all this time without saying anything, and then blaming them for her own poor financial planning is ridiculous. Ask them to leave but the main problem is still going to be there.", "You always have to have a contingency plan though. The minute that raise is no longer allowing you to comfortably afford groceries or you start pulling money out of your savings account for an emergency or to cover regular expenses, you need to reassess the situation. You don\u2019t wait until you can barely buy groceries on a consistent basis, which is what seems to have happened here.", "NTA for being angry and frustrated and wanting your in-laws off your property, but just tell them it\u2019s time to go.  Their presence is putting an unfair burden on you, so they need to find somewhere else to go.  They have the mobile home already, they just need to find somewhere else to park it, that doesn\u2019t include you paying any of their bills.", "NTA but you really should have spoken up earlier. Your husband just doesn\u2019t want to get involved but you will have to if he won\u2019t", "ESH. I\u2019ll echo that you\u2019re conflating these issues. Your problems/children\u2019s needs are relatively separate from your freeloading in-laws. \n\nIf having them off your property would make your life easier \u2014 great. \n\nIf having them pay actual rent ($200 isn\u2019t rent) and utilities would make your life easier \u2014 great. \n\nI have a feeling getting a job and not being there for your kids in the way that they need won\u2019t fix your in-law problem, it will just create interest new ones.

I\u2019m also pretty sure they\u2019ll either fail at this task or refuse it\u2026 making kicking them off the property via a conflict you created a lot easier.\n\nThis is harsh but\u2026 grow a spine.

And hate to say it, but them taking care of it wasn\u2019t part of the initial offer. You mention wanting to care for them but that didn\u2019t come with initial stipulations. \n\nI dont think OP is wrong for wanting them out.
