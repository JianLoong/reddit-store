A few months ago, my sister (let's call her Sarah) asked if I could look after her dog for a couple of weeks while she went on a vacation. I agreed, and she dropped off her adorable little Chihuahua, Gizmo, at my place.\n\nThe weeks turned into months, and Sarah never came back for Gizmo. I called her a few times, but she always had an excuse for why she couldn't pick him up yet. Meanwhile, Gizmo had become attached to me and my family, and we had grown quite fond of him.\n\nFast forward to last week, and I got a call from a friend who had just lost his own dog. He asked if I knew anyone who had a dog that needed a home, and I mentioned Gizmo. My friend met Gizmo and fell in love with him right away, so I decided to give him to him.\n\nNow, Sarah has found out that I gave Gizmo away, and she's absolutely livid. She's calling me a thief and a horrible sister for giving away her dog without her permission\n\nSarah is known for being unreliable and flaky, and she's done this before with other things and she would refuse to pick them up. I didn't want to be stuck with Gizmo forever, and I thought it was better to give him to someone who would love and care for him properly. Trust me, I know my sis, she wouldn't have ever come back for him. He was neglected.\n\nBut now I'm not sure if I did the right thing. Was it really my place to give away Sarah's dog without her permission? AITA\n\nTL;DR My sister left her dog with me for two months and didn't come back to get him. I gave him to a friend who loves him, but now my sister is furious and I'm not sure if I did the right thing..", "created_utc": 1679380893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11x92dd/aita_for_giving_away_my_sisters_dog_without_her/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
