A few months ago, my sister (let's call her Sarah) asked if I could look after her dog for a couple of weeks while she went on a vacation. I agreed, and she dropped off her adorable little Chihuahua, Gizmo, at my place.\n\nThe weeks turned into months, and Sarah never came back for Gizmo. I called her a few times, but she always had an excuse for why she couldn't pick him up yet. Meanwhile, Gizmo had become attached to me and my family, and we had grown quite fond of him.\n\nFast forward to last week, and I got a call from a friend who had just lost his own dog. He asked if I knew anyone who had a dog that needed a home, and I mentioned Gizmo. My friend met Gizmo and fell in love with him right away, so I decided to give him to him.\n\nNow, Sarah has found out that I gave Gizmo away, and she's absolutely livid. She's calling me a thief and a horrible sister for giving away her dog without her permission\n\nSarah is known for being unreliable and flaky, and she's done this before with other things and she would refuse to pick them up. I didn't want to be stuck with Gizmo forever, and I thought it was better to give him to someone who would love and care for him properly. Trust me, I know my sis, she wouldn't have ever come back for him. He was neglected.\n\nBut now I'm not sure if I did the right thing. Was it really my place to give away Sarah's dog without her permission? AITA\n\nTL;DR My sister left her dog with me for two months and didn't come back to get him. I gave him to a friend who loves him, but now my sister is furious and I'm not sure if I did the right thing..", "created_utc": 1679380893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11x92dd/aita_for_giving_away_my_sisters_dog_without_her/", "score": 317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is a minor AH for stringing you along but you are a mahoosive one.", "ESH\n\nSarah abandoned the dog, you found him a good home, you should have warned her that if she didn't pick him up you'd be making other arrangements for him, but she should have been up front about how long she really wanted you to keep him.", "NTA", "NTA at all", "ESH", "NTA\nI used to work with an extreme dog lover. I was married to an extremely difficult man (now ex) at the time. Shirley and her SIL wanted to home a dog that neither of them could take in. Dog had a family who moved and just left him behind. A co-worker couple tried to take him, but he couldn't stay in their fence and got swept up by the pound. Shirley and company freak out due to the likelihood that the dog will be put down. Husband and I are on a super tight budget, but the ladies offer to pay vet bills, etc. If we  take him in since we have a fence, it might give him a reprieve. I'm worried my ex is a known AH, but the swear they will pay and I love dogs. Dog had lots of issues (afraid of men, can't get him in car etc) I get a mobile vet to come to the house to treat what looked like possible parvo and make sure he has all his medical issues attended to as well. Dog is an escape artist, constantly digging under the fence because he LOVES kids and wants to escort the school bus kids home daily. We try various things  but live on a busy street, and both work, and I'm scared he will get hit by a car. Our neighbors asked about him one day because after he escaped. Their aunt and uncle saw him and thought perhaps he was unhomed. The aunt and uncle recently lost a beloved dog who had diabetes and who had made a two hour round trip daily for treatments. But they wanted to do a rescue. They were retired and couldn't have kids, so their pet was their baby and had the time and energy to give him the attention. I expect the whole story to them, and we agreed to rehome Luke with them since they seemed like a perfect fit. Ladies asked about him and did NOT pay the majority of the vet as promised prior to the rehoming, in spite of repeated promises (and me being in serious hot water w hubby). Then they had a fit that I had rehomed him even though I made sure that it was a wonderful place and wanted to go and visit people who were complete strangers to them.  because they thought I had just gotten rid of him. (Would NEVER do this). I did call the new family and get consent for a one-off visit.\n\nNo longer friends with Shirley after the accusations, but if you dump a dog off you really don't get a say.", "Right? A dog is attached to their owner, said owner abandons dog with a family. Dog becomes attached to family. Family gives away dog to new owner. I wonder if this dog will get some abandonment issues. \n\nAlso, what about the family that has grown fond of the dog. Were they consulted? This just seems weird.", "You mean like where she called the sis several times over the course of months and sis just kept finding new excuses? OP is NTA here. Would a last warning have been nice? yes, but you don't keep putting off picking up a furchild you want.", "I agree. My dogs are family and I couldn't imagine leaving them with someone for so long.", "I think they are, we shall see I suppose, the posts look awfully close", "She'll just take it and continue to neglect it.\n\nShe went on vacation, her house didn't burn down or something else dictating a change in life circumstances.", "When I was in high school, first thing we would do when getting home from vacation is bring all of our luggage inside to make room in the car for the dog.\n\nAs soon as we finish that we would go and pick up the dog from wherever he was being boarded. Because he was important to us.", "NTA. I may be downvoted, but if you had given her a heads up, I don't think she would take the dog. She would kust lead you on and have you keep the dog. Nope. She could have taken him before. She chose not to.", "NTA", "NTA, I don't really care why she didn't bother to even check up on her dog. If you leave a pet with someone for more than a few weeks without bothering to check up on them or communicate with the person keeping them, you forfeit all rights to that animal.  You did right by the dog.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou helped an abandoned pet find a new forever home. WELL DONE!", "NTA - most states have animal abandonment laws. Typically, state/city shelters have animals for a 7-10 day hold before considering them abandoned and able for adoption out. New York has an ordinance that any animal left out alone in public for more than three hours is abandoned and the owner subject to fines and loss of their animal. You were more than kind in keeping that poor dog for as long as you did before rehoming them.", "Yta", "ESH she shouldn\u2019t have abandon the dogs and you should have warned her before rehoming. Hopefully for you and your friend the dog isn\u2019t chipped bc she could seek legal repercussions against both of y\u2019all if she has proof she\u2019s the actual owner.", "Chihuahuas aint necessarily a pain in the ass to take care of. Small dog, little dog food. YTA", "ESH - It was shitty of your sister to leave her dog with you for that long, but you should have *at the very least*  told her \"hey, if you don't pick up Gizmo by \\[x date\\], I will be rehoming him.\"", "Little-known facts about dogs!\r  \nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/9QUtkLB0ILE?feature=share", "YTA especially if she had it chipped and you don't have anything written with last warning for her (even simple email \"you have X days to get it or it is leaving the house\" is better than nothing). Not saying she is innocent but you opened you and your friend to possible cop and/or litigation issue (and that's the reason I went with my answer and not E S H - because you made possibly innocent person a target of your sis harassment).", "NTA sounds like you saved that dog, If she didn't have time chopped your friends should, congrats on THEIR new dkg", "NTA sounds like you did right by Gizmo", "YTA. She can have you both arrested because it doesn\u2019t matter it was with you it\u2019s her property. And you are full of bs because in one breathe you say how attached the dog is to you and you to it but then you gave it away.", "Gizmo wasn't neglected.  Gizmo was abandoned... and because of that, and her track record of doing the same kind of thing in the past, you were right to find Gizmo a new home.  I don't know about the legality of it... but this place isn't about legal advice. It's AITA... and you're NTA.  \n\nYou might have warned her about this in advance though... told her that if she didn't pick up her dog within a week that you'd rehome Gizmo.  Still... you say that she has a history of abandoning her responsibilities and that it'd been a few months already.", "ESH - Sarah for being a shitty neglectful pet owner, and you for giving Gizmo away without asking", "NTA\n\nThe dog has been with you for several months and is in effect \"abandoned\" by your sister. No need to get her \"permission\". The dog deserves a chance for a good home and a happy life with someone who will love and care for him.", "She went on vacation for a couple weeks, that's atleast 2 weeks. He has had the dogs for several months (OP doesn't mention how many months) now and she just had excuses everytime."]}
