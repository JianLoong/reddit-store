She is young: the breakups are much more dramatic at that age than later on, and if the relationship was bad, it's better that you are there, rather than her going back to her ex in a moment of weaknesses. Your friend still gets to go out. And I doubt, that if her child asked her for help, she would choose to go out instead and enjoy the evening. I would add tho that maybe at some point it would be beneficial for both of you if she learnt how to deal with her emotions in the long run.", "YTA You know, it's going to be hard for her to build resilience when you keep running to her. You're enabling her because you'll fly across the country repeatedly whenever she has an uncomfortable time in her life. In two years, she'll be out looking for a job. At what point do you hope her to be independent?", "Minor YTA. Your daughter needs to learn independence OR live closer to you.  Your daughter is 20 and while that is young; she has chosen to live far away from you. That decision has consequences.", "YTA - this seems like a pattern. What are you gonna do in person that you can't do over the phone? Not going to see her doesn't mean you can't be supportive in some way. \n\nI'd be pissed too if you were always ditching to see your adult child. You're also not helping Amy build any kind of resilience by running to her every time.", "Soft YTA, the path to hell is laid with good intentions and that's where you're going with your daughter. She is 20, guiding her through life at this point in her development is gonna create an adult that can't handle life without you and is essentially crippling her. You wanna be supportive and you can but she needs to learn how to go through things and stand on her own feet or she will be screwed when you and your husband can't drop everything to get to her.", "NTA\n\nConsider cutting the cord with your friend. Her birthday -- an experienced adult birthday of 40 -- is more important than your 20 year old's misery?\n\nReally, she is incredibly judgmental and self-interested. What's shocking is that she remains your friend. \n\nYour family's needs are more important than friend's birthday.", "This sounds like a common occurrence if your friend felt the need to bring it up.

I think by running to her side the moment things get tough, you\u2019re ultimately doing your daughter a disservice. There are so many ways you can be supportive while always teaching your daughter independence and resilience. \n\n*Info - its your kid and you can see them whenever you want, and thats your business.*\n\n*BUT traveling across the country because of a breakup does seem excessive in my opinion.

You two are not doing your daughter any favors if you come running every time she can't handle an issue.  You do know you will not be around forever and she needs to learn to handle things herself.  You can guide her without being where she is.  She went through a breakup at 20.  Part of a breakup is learning how to handle it and what works for her.

There is a lot you can do to support someone on the other side of the country without dropping the ball on your own friends.\n\nShe's been at school for at least a year now (unless she took a long gap between high school and college), and should have some resiliency to get through emotional stress.", "NTA. I wonder how your friend would react if you told her the same thing the first time her children move out and she wanted to or needed her to be there....", "YTA.

A breakup can happen again at anytime. \n\nThey may not be friends after this point. Her daughter's appendix didn't burst, shes going through a breakup. Something at the age of 20 you should be able to handle yourself and with friends. I feel for this girl but at the same time agree, the cord should be cut. She needs to learn independency.", "If this a consistent thing though, don't count on being invited to the 50th. \n\nAt 20 you should know how to deal with break ups on your own or with friends. \n\nForcing your parents to miss a party because you're sad is extremely selfish", "She\u2019s spiralling and asked me to come, I offered to fly her back but she\u2019s at college and it makes it easier for me to go to her.", "Yeah, OP will likely see themselves being invited out less and less if this habit continues.", "It will, even if you visit a few times. Just tell her you won't always be able to do it--but since you can, you can hang out and build her up a bit.

Clearly people don't know what spiralling means. I've been in your daughter's position and my mom did this when I was 25. My mom said she'd rather have wasted her time and money flying over to me when I'm in a crisis and have it be nothing than have to be back for a funeral. Spiralling can lead to self-harm and suicide and you are a very special mama to love your child like that.\n\nScrew that friend, you need to cut her cord if she can't go out without you. That's a grown ass woman and not your child.", "NTA.  I am not a delicate person, but my mom flew out to spend some time with me when I was going through a tough time.  I didn't know it then, but that trip was to reassure her as much as it was to check in on me.  I am very lucky to have a mom that cares that much.  \n\nIt's your kid and your life.

Is Amy just very emotional about these things or is there a reason ot be more concerned and make the trip?", "Kids come first.

Is her mental health teetering, or is this a compassionate mom visit? \n\nI'm old I guess, but I can't imagine anything other than severe illness/accident which would have required my mom by anything other than phone in college. We were always very close, but our visits were fewer during college, and they were for together time and catching up, not because I had difficulty with school, friends or life.", "NTA. No matter their age, when our children are in a bad spot and need us, we should try to help. That means that if she is in Boston, you or your husband need to do what needs to be done to help her. Family should come first.\n\nAs for cutting the cord, we never really do. It will be interesting to see how your friend behaves when her children are the same age.", "NTA. I am around your age now, but when I was your daughter\u2019s age, I was dumped via old-fashioned letter in the mail lol. Guy was a complete jerk, but it broke my heart. Fortunately, my college was close to home because all I wanted to do was go lick my wounds with my mom: she was my safe space just like you are your daughter\u2019s safe space. Go be with your girl. Your friend can get over herself, and you can celebrate her birthday anytime.", "Nta- it's just a birthday and there are other people going. A bad breakup can lead to serious mental issues for some people. If I were you I'd see my daughter. Id rather support my family rather then celebrating with a friend.", "NTA. Your daughter is only 20 and lives on her own across the country from you. The cord is very much cut. That doesn't mean she won't occasionally need emotional support, and there's nothing wrong with that. I don't think it's appropriate for a friend to talk to you like this.

The adult birthday is one of the dumbest things to come down the pike in ages.", "It\u2019s your kid and you caring for your kid instantly makes me say NTA, nothing else in your post contradicts this verdict.

It's good to support your kid even as an adult, but can the in-person visit not wait until after the party? What's the timeframe here?", "YTA.  More importantly, you\u2019re creating a monster with your daughter.", "YTA but only because you're not actually doing your daughter a service. I've had two friends never learn emotional resilience and it didn't  get better as they got older. One's mom died unexpectedly at 55 and it left her 30 year old daughter CRUSHED. Like still not coping well five years later crushed. \n\nAt 20 I would start focusing on helping your daughter build her coping network. If she doesn't yet have a therapist she likes, offer to pay so she can start testing them out. When she calls in distress, listen for 10 minutes but then ask if she's scheduled a session with her counselor. When she has a bad break-up ask her if you can send her a treat so she can take her friends out for a movie marathon. \n\nFlying across the country to support a 20 year old in person isn't actually helping her mature her coping skills.", "Yta. Your daughter is 20 you shouldn't need to be her emotional support teddy bear when she gets sad you should have raised her to be able to cope on her own as an adult.", "YTA. The reason she \"lacks resilience\" is because it sounds like even though she's a grown ass adult, you drop everything every time she so much as stubbs a toe. She needs to learn to feel through things on her own like an adult.", "YTA because your made a commitment to your friend. Your daughter is a grown woman. She can handle a breakup.

I went through multiple breakups, very bad ones, on my own or with my friends. Does your daughter have no good friends? That's a problem, and mommy rushing to the rescue every time your daughter hits a speedbump is not going to help her be self-sufficient.", "Is it possible her lack of resilience has a lot to do with you seeing it as your job to manage her emotions?\nYTA for cancelling plans regularly, and for not helping your daughter grow", "Can\u2019t you just go right after her plans?

They always thought they'd call/go see them tomorrow/after dinner/insert timeframe here.\n\nIf daughter wanted you to go out there to go shopping or babysit while she took a weekend or some other non crises thing, then you'd need to set some boundaries.\n\nBut never ever when they're in crises and actually ask for you.", "NTA. Family comes first, always (except for many uncultured folk. Their own lives always come before their kids\u2019).", "Your daughter who \"lacks resilience\" and \"needs a lot of guidance\" from her mum lives on the opposite side of the country to you. That takes a lot of independence and resilience. Then there is the \"dad cannot possibly understand or \"guide\" daughter as well as mum\". Plus it is a habit for OP to just drop her commitments for her daughter.\n\nAnyone else get the overpowering vibe of helicopter mum who can't accept her daughter has grown up? Your daughter would probably appreciate some emotional support. But if your intention is to guide her and teach her resilience, YTA and should send dad instead for your daughter's sake. She is already upset from her breakup without having to deal with that BS. No wonder she moved to the opposite side of the country. But you are also the AH to your friend. Apparently ditching your friend happens a fair bit. This time might be justified but I doubt all the other times were. You are not a good friend.", "NTA. Obviously you are the only person who can tell us how bad the breakup was, but breakups can be devastating - especially at that age. When I was 22, I found out my boyfriend of 3 years was cheating on me and many of our mutual friends knew and opted not to tell me. It was humiliating and I was devastated and depressed and somehow, I had to pick myself up and move out of our shared apartment because he certainly was not going to leave. I could have done that on my own - I was certainly capable, and I'm sure I would have survived. \n\n  \nBut I am forever grateful that my mom drove 6 hours and dropped whatever she was doing to help me. It made me feel loved unconditionally in a moment during which I was not sure anyone would ever love me again (or had ever loved me at all).   \nI do think that developing resilience is important, and you should encourage Amy to seek therapy to deal with her issues - but even if she doesn't need you, it's still nice to know that someone has your back and is there for you.", "My youngest daughter is the same age and also studying 5000 miles away. If she needed me - and it sounds like your daughter does - I would be on the next plane. You are blessed that she is so close to you and can confide in you. I know how lucky I am to be so close to my children. Eventually they need you less and less and the relationships develop into best friendships. \n\nNot everyone has that bond or can understand it. But you did something right that she calls on you. Sending you both big hugs.", "YTA, as while obviously you get to set your priorities for your own life, but this seems to be a pattern and it sounds like your friend has had enough.  In short, it doesn\u2019t sound like you have been a good friend to her. \n\nAnd you may genuinely want to think about your relationship with your daughter and more importantly, her heavy emotional reliance on her parents.  Clearly, the fact that she is spiraling this bad from a breakup is reflective of her fragile emotion or mental health.  But given that there have been some patterns since childhood, may I ask what you have been doing about it? Because if she is not in regular therapy and getting proper professional help, you are doing a disservice to her by ONLY being there to hold her, instead of making moves to increase her resilience. She is 20 and if she does not start to do this now, you really must think of how she will survive in this world in places where parents have no place - career, navigating friendships, dating, marriage etc.", "NTA. \n\nI am 24. I live in RI and my parents also live in Arizona. I\u2019m in the military and it is so isolating living away from your family. Plus your daughter is still young and on her own and she needs a strong support to help her grow and learn from this. I would\u2019ve given everything in the world for my mom to be able to come help me during my divorce but it was COVID. Your daughter probably feels so special and loved and that\u2019s EXACTLY what she needs right now. Your friend is cruel and tbh let her have her party without you there because she sound miserable.", "NTA. \nI\u2019d do anything for my daughter. You know her and her needs best. \nYour friend is seemingly local, so she can see you another time. She can maintain her plans since others are attending. \nYour daughter isn\u2019t fully grown up yet and needs her mom. \nGo take care of your baby without guilt. Your friend will get over it. Or she won\u2019t. But your daughter will always be grateful for your relationship, I\u2019m sure.", "Yta it sounds like you\u2019ve done this a few times to your friend and you need to deal with the consequences of friends not wanting to stick around when you ditch them.", "NTA.\n\nListen , I get it. Can your child learn to be more resilient? Yeah, but she\u2019s still a kid. She still learning and growing. I\u2019m 24 and I still have a long way to go in terms of growth.\n\nBreakups at that age can be devastating, especially if they were serious. A lot of the people saying YTA are assuming that because their breakups weren\u2019t bad, that all breakups are just easy to brush off.\n\nWhen I was 17 I was in a highly abusive relationship but I was so in love with this guy. When I found he cheated and I broke up with him, I absolutely spiraled. I didn\u2019t eat or sleep for DAYS to the point I was concerning my friends. I don\u2019t have parents who care enough to console me, and I would\u2019ve killed for any family member to be near me when that happened. I can\u2019t imagine having to go through that and be so far away from family.\n\nBe there for your daughter, but let her know you cannot always be there as well. Support her and listen to her, but she will need to learn how to process these events herself as she gets older. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with you prioritizing your child - that\u2019s what you should do as a parent.\n\nAs for your friend, I\u2019d say a very large apology is in order, and see what you can do to make it up to her, even if it won\u2019t restore your friendship.

People will tell you, and it's true, you won't be there forever, but the same thing can be said for a spouse that people use as a crutch. Spouses likely pass at different times and when one is left alone they have to face grief alone.

(Make it up to friend however you can, though!! She may understand when her kids are older). \n\nBless you for being there for your daughter. Literally who cares how needy or dependent or naive or whatever she may be, you\u2019re *mom* and it\u2019s incredibly beautiful that she can still go to mom when she feels lost and upset. Everybody deserves to have that, it\u2019s okay to need it, and she will never ever forget your warmth.", "NTA. Since when does a friend's social event trump our child's needs?

You're parenting more intensely than she thinks she would, but so what? She's not entitled to your time. Your husband is in agreement that someone flying there would be proportionate to her need, so based on two people's takes, I'm inclined to think it probably is. And your friend has younger children, she really has no idea what a hurting young-adult-child needs. She's TA for questioning your judgment that you're needed more somewhere else and TA for acting entitled to be your top priority when you have a situation of at least perceived child in need. I will say that she may have a legitimate grievance about your attention to the friendship in general, and maybe you should take her out for a nice lunch and pay some extra attention to her when you come back, but for now, go see your daughter and don't give it another thought til you've done what you need to do for her.", "Ewww, she needs to mind her business.  I'm sure she's disappointed, but damn that's your kid (regardless of age), and if you want to be there for her, then be there for her.   Your friend is the ah for only thinking about herself.

Not sure if it's our sociology or what, but most other places seem to be more connected to family. This obviously doesn't apply to horrible family situations but a lot of people seem to think once your kids are grown, they just need to fend for themselves.

When one of my friends suddenly can\u2019t attend something I don\u2019t start telling them how to live their life around me!", "They\u2019re close enough that her friend is upset. \n\nFor me it still comes down to the fact that, at least based on the information provided, there\u2019s no reason that OP couldn\u2019t put off the trip for a day or two so she could attend the party.", "But if you don't teach resilience, then you must be resilient for them forever. \n\nThis is the problem with all the helicopter parenting. They will figure it out. Give them guidance outside of the situation if you need to, but let them figure out the solution on their own. \n\nOtherwise you will be flying Boston to Arizona a lot. Or you will just move to Boston and forget you have your own purpose and life outside of your kids.", "But OPs friend could be talking about events prior to this year. OP listed three cancellations in this year alone.\n\nHonestly, that's quite a few times for a single year, but both statements can still be true.", "Yeah ik, OP frickin dipped.", "I love that story so much. I am 32 also, and when I visit home I will get into bed with my mom & watch movies, drink wine, etc. and my dad will end up sleeping on the couch. There are like 3 people I can do that with: my husband, my best friend, and my mom. I will NEVER grow out of it dammit!", "I do not have supportive parents or a mom like this, and I love this for you, and I love this for OP\u2019s kiddo. Everyone should have parents like this.", "Ahhh what a good mom. Gosh so many good stories. We all need to thank our moms tomorrow.", "Holy shit. A lot of cold people on reddit.", "Listen, I hear you, but OP is admitting here that she didn\u2019t teach her daughter to be resilient into adulthood. Unless her daughter has a history of mental illness and self-harm, going through shit partners and horrible break-ups is common in your 20s. Learning how to overcome those moments teaches you healthy coping skills and resilience. It also teaches you how to handle future break ups.\n\nIf OP does this frequently as her friend is claiming, it\u2019s not doing anyone any favours. Having a social network outside of your family is important too.", "Thank you - so many people went wild with assumptions on this post and started to really be quite rude to a lot of the Y T A which is a shame. \n\nA lot of the YTA votes seem to just be saying, be there and be supportive but you dont need to drop everything and fly across the country to do that.", "It's in the title", "There are 114 colleges in Massachusetts - i dont think one can assume one way or another which school it is. \n\nBut if Mom has to fly out because of a break up, it does make you wonder if being this far away is good for her.", "Both are in Cambridge, jfc", "Yeah, and the isolation you can experience in a large city far from family and childhood friends can't be understated. I have multiple friends who moved to a big city with little to no support network and one of the things most of them experienced was making poor romantic decisions because it was better than the crushing isolation. And it fucked them all up on some level. Having a parent who can fly across the country to provide comfort and aid during those times is huge.", "OK but you can wait a day", "Yes! I feel exactly the same way.", "Ah didn\u2019t see that", "It also makes you wonder if the daughter picked a place halfway across the country to be on her own and get away from being smothered.", "Because it's past time for her daughter to learn how to cope by herself.  \n\nBeing a parent is teaching your children to be self sufficient", "I went to a highly academic college and at two points in my college career my mom had to drive down to make sure I didn't off myself.  You can be emotionally fucked up and still get As.", "I went to an Ivy League undergrad and then medical school. I had a terrible breakup during residency (ex bailed the day after our wedding and I still have to move to his city to start my residency training later that week). My dad was coming to visit me several times a month for a while after it happened, and actually stayed with me and worked remote for a couple months after it first happened. Stuff happens sometimes.", "Yes. In some cases even more so. The pressure at top schools is incredible. This is a young woman who went through the pandemic in high school. But I\u2019m not sure why OP can\u2019t wait a day", "Seriously.The daughter already lives across the country. She clearly has some degree of independence.", "I feel like emotional support from parents is lacking in society as a whole, particularly because many parents cut the cord at 18. Then we wonder what happened when unfortunate events take place (shootings, suicides, etc.). We could all do with more support.", "I went through my first breakup in my early 20s and I laid down face first on a public sidewalk and cried lmao. (If you\u2019ve seen the Barbie movie, picture sad floor Barbie but sobbing.) Not my proudest moment. I\u2019ve been though a hell of a lot worse since then but your first heartbreak is something else."]}
