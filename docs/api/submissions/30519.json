I'd fly to my kids if they were feeling low and asked me to come. And mine are older than yours.", "NTA.  You're being a wonderfully supportive parent who knows her daughter's personality and needs.  The world will not stop rotating on its axis if you don't attend your friend's 40th birthday night on the town.  Do it with her another night.", "YTA  \n\n\nYou are a helicopter parent who zips in at the slightest. She has you trained to do this.", "NAH but it sounds like your friend is understandably disappointed especially since you've cancelled on her before. Ideally you would go visit your daughter before or after previously made commitments", "I was heavily leaning towards N T A until your friend pointed out that this is apparently a recurring theme for you.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say NAH instead though you are sort of toeing the line. I can\u2019t really say you\u2019re an AH for supporting your daughter *this* time but I\u2019m very curious about if the other times you canceled plans with your friend was also somewhat justified or not. Tbh I can see why your friend\u2019s patience is starting to wear thin. \n\nI also feel that continuing to drop everything to go see her is not going to do help your daughter\u2019s lack if resilience at all. If anything you might be crippling or enabling her.", "Lol. \u201cMy daughter has resilience issues\u201d\u2026.

She is young: the breakups are much more dramatic at that age than later on, and if the relationship was bad, it's better that you are there, rather than her going back to her ex in a moment of weaknesses. Your friend still gets to go out. And I doubt, that if her child asked her for help, she would choose to go out instead and enjoy the evening. I would add tho that maybe at some point it would be beneficial for both of you if she learnt how to deal with her emotions in the long run.", "YTA You know, it's going to be hard for her to build resilience when you keep running to her. You're enabling her because you'll fly across the country repeatedly whenever she has an uncomfortable time in her life. In two years, she'll be out looking for a job. At what point do you hope her to be independent?", "Minor YTA. Your daughter needs to learn independence OR live closer to you.  Your daughter is 20 and while that is young; she has chosen to live far away from you. That decision has consequences.", "YTA - this seems like a pattern. What are you gonna do in person that you can't do over the phone? Not going to see her doesn't mean you can't be supportive in some way. \n\nI'd be pissed too if you were always ditching to see your adult child. You're also not helping Amy build any kind of resilience by running to her every time.", "Soft YTA, the path to hell is laid with good intentions and that's where you're going with your daughter. She is 20, guiding her through life at this point in her development is gonna create an adult that can't handle life without you and is essentially crippling her. You wanna be supportive and you can but she needs to learn how to go through things and stand on her own feet or she will be screwed when you and your husband can't drop everything to get to her.", "NTA\n\nConsider cutting the cord with your friend. Her birthday -- an experienced adult birthday of 40 -- is more important than your 20 year old's misery?\n\nReally, she is incredibly judgmental and self-interested. What's shocking is that she remains your friend. \n\nYour family's needs are more important than friend's birthday.", "This sounds like a common occurrence if your friend felt the need to bring it up.  I get wanting to be there for your daughter.  However she will eventually have to learn to cope with things on *her* own.  You won\u2019t always be there to run and help her.\n\nYTA and if I was your friend id quit trying to make plans with you.", "NTA- other people are going, her event isnt being cancelled.  Amy is 20yo, she needs help. Mental health is important, break ups suck.", "NTA\n\nHer birthday celebration is still going forward. How you parent your child through an emotional breakup is your business.", "INFO: is it true that there have been numerous times you\u2019ve cancelled plans you made with friends? If so YTA. If it\u2019s like, two or three times, NTA.", "NTA...\n\nThis situation is exactly what moms are for.\n\n  \nI will say that I hope she needs you to do this (or you feel the need to do this) less and less as time goes on... as others have said, she needs to stand on her own 2 feet eventually.  \n\n\nAlso, could she maybe hold it together until after your friend's party and then you go out?", "Info - its your kid and you can see them whenever you want, and thats your business. \n\nBUT traveling across the country because of a breakup does seem excessive in my opinion. Did she *actually* need you there or did you need to be needed there?", "NTA.  Any friend that thinks they are more important than your child is not a friend.  And I hope for her children's sake, she doesn't follow the same attitude when they need her.", "ESH.  You two are not doing your daughter any favors if you come running every time she can't handle an issue.  You do know you will not be around forever and she needs to learn to handle things herself.  You can guide her without being where she is.  She went through a breakup at 20.  Part of a breakup is learning how to handle it and what works for her.  She is not going to figure that out if you go there.  Make suggestions from where you are, check in on her once a day, etc.", "YTA\nIf it wasn't a recurring theme, you wouldn't be the asshole. But constantly cancelling plans and dropping everything to go see your adult daughter is a bit much. There is a lot you can do to support someone on the other side of the country without dropping the ball on your own friends.\n\nShe's been at school for at least a year now (unless she took a long gap between high school and college), and should have some resiliency to get through emotional stress.", "NTA. I wonder how your friend would react if you told her the same thing the first time her children move out and she wanted to or needed her to be there....", "YTA. Your daughter lacks resilience because she\u2019s never had to be resilient. No time like the present. I agree with your friend; cut the cord.", "NTA! If your daughter were closer to 30, I might agree with needing to cut the cord. However, she is 20. She is also still developing, and you KNOW her, her needs, how she handles things etc. If this is her first real heartbreak, I can understand her wanting her mom's support & hugs. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nYour friend telling you how to deal with YOUR kid is out of pocket. Make it up to her via rain check and go be with your daughter. She needs you. NTA.", "dunno why this posted twice lol", "As somebody who\u2019s been in the friends position I get the friend\u2019s response.  I had a friend of almost 20 years.  I was the one always making plans and she\u2019d end up canceling. I decided to quit being the one who reached out first.   The \u201cfriendship\u201d fizzled and we don\u2019t talk anymore.", "She is at college, we thought it would build resilience.", "Honestly have to disagree. \n\nIf your friend does this to you consistently, you would definitely be labeling them a bad friend. If this is an occuring theme, this is actually showing a character flaw in op. \n40 yr bdays only happen once. And old people only throw themselves a party every ten years or so at the milestones. A breakup can happen again at anytime. \n\nThey may not be friends after this point. Her daughter's appendix didn't burst, shes going through a breakup. Something at the age of 20 you should be able to handle yourself and with friends. I feel for this girl but at the same time agree, the cord should be cut. She needs to learn independency.", "If this a consistent thing though, don't count on being invited to the 50th. \n\nAt 20 you should know how to deal with break ups on your own or with friends. \n\nForcing your parents to miss a party because you're sad is extremely selfish", "She\u2019s spiralling and asked me to come, I offered to fly her back but she\u2019s at college and it makes it easier for me to go to her.", "Yeah, OP will likely see themselves being invited out less and less if this habit continues.", "It will, even if you visit a few times. Just tell her you won't always be able to do it--but since you can, you can hang out and build her up a bit. She'll have more spirals and breakdowns in her college life, some you can help with and some you can't. Building her up and being there for her helps", "Building resilience by treating her like a teen.", "Is she in therapy? If she\u2019s struggling this much, she needs professional help.", "are you helping her to build resilience by flying out?", "What does that mean though? Spiraling as in eat a sleeve of Oreos or actual mental health crises? \n\nBecause if one breakup means you have to fly out to see her, should she be on her own? She\u2019s 20 and, respectfully, she needs to extend her support system to something thats realistic and tenable", "Definitely go.", "How is she supposed to learn resilience and develop her own support structure if you're going to drop everything to fly out and fix it every time something doesn't go her way?\n\nLet the kid launch"]}
