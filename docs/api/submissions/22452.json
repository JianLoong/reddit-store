In That same week I had to plan her funeral by myself, my insurance acted up and I couldn\u2019t get my antidepressants, my primary care physician quit, and my eye doctor stopped taking my premium insurance because they no longer accept it, just the regular grade so I can\u2019t even get new glasses. On top of I had to miss two very important doctors appointments because she passed and there was so much to do. Today was just the icing on the cake. My boyfriend (20 M) told me (22 F) that his dad had looked at my car this morning before I left for work and noticed my tires were low. His dad forgot to text him to let me know not to go to work. I haven\u2019t been in the right state of mind so I forgot to check my car out before driving and I drove to work feeling numb and not paying attention. He finally lets me know about my flat tire around my last break on my 7 hour shift. I panic and have a meltdown. Everything has just gone wrong. I don\u2019t know how to fix a tire. I asked him if he could come help me. He said he was busy. Luckily my best friend was there. I got off the phone with him and broke down again to my best friend. (21 F) She then calls her boyfriend (26? M) and ask him to come fix my tire. He dropped what he was doing and came to our job and fixed it. About an hour later my boyfriend pulls up just after we fixed the tire and got it on my car. I told him it was fixed, he saw that my best friend\u2019s boyfriend was the one that fixed it and got mad, said some stuff and drove off. I apologized to my friend\u2019s, I was mortified with the tone he had taken and the way he was acting. Later I came home and waited on the back porch for him to talk about it. He informed me his pride was hurt that another man changed my tire for me. I told him that he did say he was busy and if I had waited for him to show up I would have been stranded for an hour. I asked \u201cWhat were you so busy doing?\u201d He informed me he was in the middle of a video game and it \u201ctook longer than expected.\u201d So I asked him why his pride and video games were more important than my safety and me being able to get home to him sooner? He then tried to justify what he had done by saying \u201cI thought you got off at 8.\u201d (I got off at 7 but had texted him at 6.) He is still mad at me because another guy changed my tire instead of him.

At first I thought your boyfriend was being immature and you should talk but then\u2026 he didn\u2019t come because he was playing a video game! And he knew about all the bad luck you were having on top of the tire. Girl, this is a red flag and I would seriously reconsider this relationship. Please use your friend\u2019s boyfriend as an example of what a supportive partner should look like. Gosh I feel so bad for you, this is not your week.", "Please do not waste any more time with this individual who has demonstrated that you are not a priority and neither is your safety.  Pretending he didn't know when you got off work is the icing on the cake.  Move on.  Also, please be sure to give a meaningful thank you to your friend and the boyfriend who helped you out.   I am so glad I am too old to deal with men who play video games and cannot monitor their addiction.  Like.  Seriously.  A game over you!?!?!?!??!  Nope.", "NTA. Your BF is ashamed that he didn\u2019t show up for you and someone else did. He should be ashamed. He shouldn\u2019t be trying to blame you for the fact that he feels bad.

And you thought that when he was going to put it on, it might be too big and that it wouldn\u2019t fit. Lmao jk jk. But in all seriousness, I wish you peace and comfort during this time of grieving.

I'm truly wishing the best for you and I hope it lets up soon. The grief will ebb and flow and there will be easier moments and I hope you feel that relief eventually. You mentioned antidepressants, so I'm wondering if you're in therapy? It helped me a lot when my mom passed. I definitely needed it. If you're not, then hopefully you at least feel comfortable talking through it with certain people. You've got this, even if it may not feel like it right now. You can get through this."]}
