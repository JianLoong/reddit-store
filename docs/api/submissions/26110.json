{"id": 26110, "submission_id": "168jj2a", "title": "AITA for throwing out food i was making from scratch, because I felt my effort unappreciated by my wife?", "selftext": "The title is vague, I know. I found it hard to word the problem.\n\nAnyway, so I am the cook of our household: I do all of it. I enjoy cooking, and enjoy experimenting in the kitchen. As of late, I have been making pizzas and learned about cold fermentation. For the uninitiated, it is allowing the dough to rise slowly in the fridge for a few days. I have learned that NY style pizza is made this way, and I have been itching to recreate it at home since I grew up with it. I thought \"if they do it, I should try it too\"\n\nIts not a \"hard\" process, but it is lots of small steps spread out over several days.\n\nShe asked while I was making it; \"why does this have to be so complicated?, every dough i see on youtube takes like an hour\" (referring to the classic technique of rising it at room temperature) I briefly explained that this process makes a more airy crust with a unique flavor, and is what every pizza shop in NY (and in Naples) is doing.\n\nShe replied \"i dont *like* that, you are making it too complicated. The best homemade pizza I ever had was storebought\" (the kind that you add water, mix, and bake).\n\nNow, I wasn't upset at all that she likes that kind of homemade pizza. If thats what she likes, so be it. I fully believe in \"not yucking someone else's yum\". But what really frustrated me was that she was making it sound like I was doing all that extra effort for no good reason. Like it was totally unappreciated. And frankly, I much prefer food I make from scratch over storebought, and since I am doing the cooking: I feel that I get to make that decision.\n\nSo, I threw the dough I was working on into the trash and said \"fine, I am glad you appreciate my cooking\" (obviously sarcastic) and left to cool off in our bedroom. She came in maybe an hour later and didn't apologize, but said \"why are you so upset?\" I explained, again, that her comment made me feel unappreciated. She just kinda scoffed, and walked away.\n\nNote: this was not something we were going to eat that day for dinner, since it is a 3 day process. So I did not ruin that day's dinner plans by tossing the dough.\n\nDid I overreact? I really love cooking (particularly from scratch), its not only a necessity to survive, but a hobby for me. But having someone not appreciate the effort i put into it just kills the joy for me.\n\nETA: if it comes up as a question: I purchased the ingredients myself (no joint account) since the four was 00 flour, which is not something we keep on hand.\n\nETA2: Timeline: this occurred yesterday. I had just started the process of making it.\n\nETA3: since tone/infection is hard to type: while my comment was sarcastic, i did not yell, and nor did i toss it dramatically in the trash. Just put it in there like i would anything else, and calmly walked to our bedroom. Making space to cool off has always been a coping mechanism for me to prevent escalation/further escalation in any argument, before returning to it with a clear head.\n\nFinal edit: ok, I made another batch today.

You both behaved childishly but you came off the worst for it.\n\nMy husband doesn't really understand why I try so many different ways of making breads, Cheeses, preserved meats etc. But I'm not trying new ways of doing things for him to appriciate. I'm doing it because I enjoy the process and the sometimes surprising outcomes. It's fine, I don't understand my husbands love of his hobby but I recognise it makes him happy.\n\nIf my husband reacted the way you're wife did, I say something like \"you don't have to understand it. All you have to understand is this makes me happy and you don't have to cook dinner tomorrow. Why would any of this bother you?\". Heck, I've even given specific instruction along the lines of \"I know you don't care so much about this stuff. Just make noises that show you're happy I'm happy and leave it at that.\"\n\nInstead you've ruined a thing you enjoyed and are upset because she STILL doesnt understand what you're actually upset about. Kind of seems like you played yourself.\n\nYou guys really need to figure out how to communicate.", "ESH.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: you make that kind of dough because you enjoy cooking & experimenting. There\u2019s fresh food & then there\u2019s spending 3 days on pizza dough. It\u2019s not surprising that some people (like your wife) just aren\u2019t going to understand that. She had a terrible attitude, but you escalated things by throwing it away and storming off.\n\nFrankly, you\u2019re probably right in that your wife doesn\u2019t appreciate the extreme kind of effort that goes in to making this kind of pizza dough\u2026 while I expect she appreciates your cooking in general, I\u2019d venture a guess that a lot of people who like fresh, homemade food don\u2019t need it to be this kind of process. I think you probably need to accept that unless you want perpetual disappointment.\n\nIf she\u2019s normally happy about what you fix, I\u2019ll assume this was a bad day for you both. Hopefully you can talk it out & move on.\n\nUltimately, your tantrum hurt you more than anyone because she didn\u2019t understand from the off. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have eaten it once it was ready, but throwing it away like a dejected child means you don\u2019t have it & you\u2019re the one who wanted it in the first place.\n\nPersonally speaking, I tend to cook more gourmet than a lot of people. I know some people like that, but many would be happy with something super simple. If you\u2019re really doing this for yourself, that needs to be the focus. Of course we all want our loved ones to enjoy what we cook, but we also have loved ones who are happy to eat a lobster risotto and the next day, they\u2019re happy with a casserole they made themselves.

There was a better way to prove your point by actually making the pizza and let your wife taste it so she can tell the difference.

I found it hard to word the problem.\n\nAnyway, so I am the cook of our household: I do all of it. I enjoy cooking, and enjoy experimenting in the kitchen. As of late, I have been making pizzas and learned about cold fermentation. For the uninitiated, it is allowing the dough to rise slowly in the fridge for a few days. I have learned that NY style pizza is made this way, and I have been itching to recreate it at home since I grew up with it. I thought \"if they do it, I should try it too\"\n\nIts not a \"hard\" process, but it is lots of small steps spread out over several days.\n\nShe asked while I was making it; \"why does this have to be so complicated?, every dough i see on youtube takes like an hour\" (referring to the classic technique of rising it at room temperature) I briefly explained that this process makes a more airy crust with a unique flavor, and is what every pizza shop in NY (and in Naples) is doing.  \n\n\nShe replied \"i dont *like* that, you are making it too complicated. The best homemade pizza I ever had was storebought\" (the kind that you add water, mix, and bake). \n\nNow, I wasn't upset at all that she likes that kind of homemade pizza. If thats what she likes, so be it. I fully believe in \"not yucking someone else's yum\". But what really frustrated me was that she was making it sound like I was doing all that extra effort for no good reason. Like it was totally unappreciated. And frankly, I much prefer food I make from scratch over storebought, and since I am doing the cooking: I feel that I get to make that decision.\n\nSo, I threw the dough I was working on into the trash and said \"fine, I am glad you appreciate my cooking\" (obviously sarcastic) and left to cool off in our bedroom. She came in maybe an hour later and didn't apologize, but said \"why are you so upset?\" I explained, again, that her comment made me feel unappreciated. She just kinda scoffed, and walked away.\n\nNote: this was not something we were going to eat that day for dinner, since it is a 3 day process. So I did not ruin that day's dinner plans by tossing the dough.\n\nDid I overreact? I really love cooking (particularly from scratch), its not only a necessity to survive, but a hobby for me. But having someone not appreciate the effort i put into it just kills the joy for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I had a partner who every time I asked about food, the first thing out of their mouth was negative. Always. I stoped asking and I stopped wanting them as a partner. \n\n>She replied \"i dont like that, you are making it too complicated. The best homemade pizza I ever had was storebought\" (the kind that you add water, mix, and bake).\n\nDo you exist just to serve her in her mind?", "NTA. You behaved childishly by throwing out the dough but I understand why you were so frustrated you rather just stop. Your wife is being a jerk. Shitting all over someone\u2019s excited efforts for a from-scratch meal is ugly.", "I\u2019m not understanding why your wife is taking issue with your methods for making the dough. Does it take up too much space in the refrigerator for 3 days?  Does she just see this as a waste of your time?  Not see the payoff compared to the huge effort?  I love making sourdough bread and pizza dough but I personally wouldn\u2019t wait 3 days for pizza crust. I make a kickass one in 2 hours with a bread maker. Maybe you need to pay less attention to your dough and more attention to your wife?  Good pizza should bring you together, not tear you apart.", "I basically get the same reaction from my husband every time even though I\u2019ve got the process down pat. Anyway, he insists he loves my crust best, but then always complains about me doing it even though it just takes a few minutes and it doesn\u2019t affect him at all, and he prefers to stop by our local pizzeria for some dough balls even though I tell him I want to make it myself. He always buys extra so even if I were to quickly prep the dough for the fridge we wouldn\u2019t need it the next day when it would be ready because he bought extra of the pizzeria\u2019s. He has it in his head that it\u2019s this big ordeal so I\u2019ve learned to just prep the dough quietly in the background and the next day he always thinks my pizza is the world\u2019s best.", "YTA to yourself. You wanted that pizza, and you let your wife\u2019s immature behavior ruin something that you really wanted. I hope you take better care of yourself.", "   Of course YTA for wasting the  perfectly good dough.\n\n   More importantly YTA for overreacting and stressing your so and yourself because\nyou felt your work was unappreciated. Your SO didn't ask for a cooly fermented doug  that takes 3 days.  You chose to do it, because you enjoy cooking and experimenting.  To give an example it is like you bought an expensive gift for your So, based on what you would like to receive, and now you are mad because they weren't excited over it.", "YTA- This sounds really childish. You decided to make dough this way. Most of your post is about you...you love to cook and you love to make things from scratch and you wanted to make it this way because you do all of the cooking. She was merely saying that it seemed complicated to her and that she would basically eat whatever like store bought dough. She didn't say it wasn't going to be good. She didn't say she wasn't going to eat it. It seemed like she was wondering why go through all of that trouble just for pizza dough. She isn't into cooking like you are. It isn't her hobby. She also didn't ask you to make it lol Throwing it away was a temper tantrum moment and super wasteful. If this is something you love to do, why do you care if she appreciates it? You're the one that wanted to do it...you're the one that loves cooking. She didn't sound ungrateful at all. She just simply observed that it seemed complicated to her. I would have made the damn pizza. Sounds like it would have been really good. She probably would have enjoyed it.", "NTA but maybe a bit of an overreaction, but then again I'm petty af and would have continued to make the pizza for myself and just made her a frozen pizza from the store and refused to share my amazing pizza. I've done this to my grandmother before when I was making chili, every step I did she'd berate me for cooking it wrong and by the time the house was smelling amazing I was fed up with her attitude and made her a sandwich with potted meat and told her bon App\u00e9tit, now shut up and leave me alone. She fussed how she wanted to try the chili and I told her nope, wouldn't want to risk her health with my awful cooking.

Your response of throwing away was irrational and at odds with your claim that you are fine with your wife preferring store-bought pizza, and that you are cooking to please yourself.", "Tbh I would have continued to make this dough & the pizza let her taste how good it is just to prove her wrong. If she didn't like it then I would only make it for myself in future & she can have frozen pizza instead. NTA", "YTA for using \"ETA\" as anything other than \"estimated time of arrival\"", "YTA. Part of the problem is that cooking IS a chore even if it is also your hobby. You both need to eat, and both of you are going to have opinions occasionally on what you eat. Your wife doesn\u2019t cook, but she\u2019s still an adult that can express preferences. I recognize that as a cook, you want to share your cooking but you can\u2019t make your wife appreciate everything that you cook, especially when she fundamentally disagrees with your approach.\n\nI appreciate that your resentment has a lot to do with not liking art while you just got back from a three hour art show for your wife \u2026 but on a practical level, you are both eating your cooking far more frequently that you are attending art shows for her. You even acknowledge that your wife appreciates your cooking in other contexts. This isn\u2019t a situation where your ungrateful wife doesn\u2019t see your effort. It\u2019s a situation where your wife appreciates your cooking consistently and didn\u2019t in this one particular instance because she doesn\u2019t like the way that you are preparing food.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between \u201cI am trying out a new technique for dinner,\u201d where it is reasonable for your wife to express her likes and dislikes, and \u201cI am trying out a project for me,\u201d which is where your wife should be willing to support your hobby. You seemed to just assume that she would see the pizza as a hobby and not dinner because you went to the art show, but you never actually communicated that to her. Even after your argument, you still made it about APPRECIATION and not SUPPORT. Of course she didn\u2019t appreciate the effort! She didn\u2019t want the homemade pizza, and she\u2019s viewing this dinner as other dinners, household chores that need to happen. If you have a meal that you really want to do as a special project, then you need to communicate to her so that she can support your hobbies.\n\nYour hobby is cooking, and that\u2019s the issue\u2014You have intertwined a hobby with a chore\u2014but that means that sometimes your wife is going to respond to your cooking as if it is a household task on which she can comment.", "This is why you don't marry people who were raised on chicken nuggets.", "NTA.

Tell her you feel unappreciated and have decided to take a break from cooking for a month and let her do it. My husband loves to cook and has for the past 30 years. That equates to him doing all of the grocery shopping as well since he knows what he needs. Cooking and shopping was just a chore to me and I really love and appreciate the fact he does it all and is so good at it. He has tried pizza doughs many different ways just for fun and perfection. Definitely telling him about the cold fermentation process.  \nThe full shift happened when my son was 4 and I was making a grilled cheese sandwich. My husband was making comments and giving instructions from the living room. I raised my hands into the air and backed away from the stove and never went back. We still laugh about that to this day.

So why should she be expected to appreciate the pizza experiment when it\u2019s reversed?", "Yeah I agree. Being a baby about it and throwing out something you\u2019re making for your own pleasure is an asshole move tho. She don\u2019t owe him appreciation, even if what she said was over the line. He can\u2019t be pissed about her not being grateful for dining something he\u2019s doing for him, not for her.", "And he could have just taken her \"complaining\" as good-natured razzing (which sure sounds like what it was) and not thrown a shit-fit over it.\n\nNobody was their best self in this story.", ">He wasn't asking for praise.\n\nI disagree.\n\n> i don't think it is too much to ask to at least appreciate the process it took to get there.", "You don\u2019t understand what an analogy is? \n\nThis situation  kind of reminds me of something I encountered years ago when I was an aspiring music producer. There was a video of a guy who sampled his snare drum sound and ran through so many different effects and manipulations (including a guitar pedal) that it wound up sounding like a guitar. \n\nEverybody thought he was a genius, but I thought he was a moron. To my way of thinking, why not just sample a guitar string or even a keyboard (which he had) and run THAT through the guitar pedal. \n\nThis is kind of the same thing, although it\u2019s possible to have a better finished product. From her eyes, it\u2019s Pizza. She doesn\u2019t care about the long process and does not have the discerning type of pallet. \n\nIn that sense, it IS like a load of laundry. All the person cares about is if the clothes get clean, not the \u2018beauty\u2019 of the process.", "It\u2019s an absolutely terrible analogy tf", "Ok, then say, 'I'd like for *us* to try this and see if there's a major difference in taste'.\n\nEnjoy your cooking hobby and ask her to not denigrate it... particularly since she also benefits.\n\nMaybe she's not happy that you spend time on cooking instead of canoodling... Ask her why she insists upon besmirching your culinary enjoyment (sorry, thesaurus was open) and request that she stop or at least tone it down.", "And that's she is an ahole, too", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Damn these words have been watered down", "It's not about her excitement or lack thereof. She could have asked why he was doing it that way and then said that's silly but ok. The way she insulted him and whined about it when it's not got any bearing on her is what makes her TA and OP NTA.\n\nWho the fuck throws a tantrum when someone else is making you pizza from scratch and you don't have to do anything about it???", "My god, you guys keep associating being appreciative with praise. No, she doesn\u2019t need to sing his praises for making a pizza in a different style. Yes, she should be appreciative that he\u2019s making food for her. She doesn\u2019t even need to lift a finger or spend a single cent and she\u2019s getting a home-cooked meal. Some appreciation for that fact is not a big ask.", "So what? You absolutely *should* appreciate your partner making an effort for you. If you don't you're kind of a bad person and don't deserve a partner.", "Didn't seem like he was asking for appreciation, he just wanted her to not shit all over his effort.", "Ok but she\u2019d be eating whatever pizza it is either way\u2026?? Him cooking it this way doesn\u2019t prevent her from eating it or anything like that. I said this in another comment too, but if all she has to do is eat, and she\u2019s not allergic to anything he\u2019s putting on the table, and it doesn\u2019t affect their dinner that night, I see no reasonable complaint. Also, respecting the effort does not necessarily equate to being grateful.", "I don't think it is an asshole move tbh. Because the dough is extremely cheap, he was only started on it, and the only OP is hurting is himself. At worst it's a bit dumb.\n\nAlso he wasn't looking for appreciation, he explained several times in comments. But having her just come out of nowhere like a fart and criticize his food stole all the fun. And honestly, as someone who loves to bake I kinda get it. It's NTA to me, don't spit into the hands that feeds you, even if you don't get the appeal of extensive cooking.\n\nThe comments give more interesting context btw if you wanna read.", "How is it an asshole move if 1) he doesn\u2019t want to do it anymore and 2) she didn\u2019t want it to begin with. It\u2019s flour and water it\u2019s not like he was pulling out a fresh pizza out of the oven and tossed it. There\u2019s literally millions of options of food he can do instead\u2026", "Why is his wife giving him a \u201crazzing\u201d about something he enjoys? he got frustrated because she was being rude and shitting on him, I\u2019d feel the same way. She didn\u2019t even apologize, sounds like she doesn\u2019t give a fuck.", "Appreciating that it took effort doesn\u2019t necessarily constitute praise. OP\u2019s not all \u201chey, look at me, compliment the food I made\u201d, but he just wants some respect for the time he put into it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.", "Is it really that bad for wanting appreciation or praise for one's efforts occasionally?", "She does care though. She went out of her way to complain about his method and say she doesn't like it (even though she hadn't even tried the pizza yet). Dude was just minding his own business. She came in and was like \"what are you doing? Ugh, why? That's dumb.\" Fuck right off with that. I would have made the pizza and not let her have any.", "I very much doubt that many people care a lot about how their laundry gets clean or are passionate about doing laundry. Spending time collecting special equipment or techniques or unique detergents & stain removers. The crazy music sampler is a better analogy.\n\nUnlike laundry, many people are passionate about cooking. OP clearly is, and so am I. Other people don't have to give a shit about how I go about making something. I couldn't care less. But I get just as pissed as OP when my sister, who hates to cook (but loves my food), starts carrying on about my preparations. True, I doubt I'd throw something out, but I'm a good deal older and less impulsive.\n\nAnd it's palate, not pallet.", "What\u2019s terrible about it?", "He literally says he doesn't enjoy cooking if someone else (i.e. his wife) doesn't praise him for it.\n\n> But having someone not appreciate the effort i put into it just kills the joy for me.", "He literally said having someone not appreciate his efforts kills the joy for him. He has a hobby, which is great, but you can\u2019t expect others to care about your hobbies all the time.", "Yeah - she said it was ok, but not her prefered pizza.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe did not complain, she just let him know all that effort was not necessary or beneficial for HER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" Also, respecting the effort \" .. What is ther eto respect. He has a hobbym and he is doing that. Completely fine, but it has nothing to do with HER. Pizza is still just pizza, and he will do ok even if others are likely better.", "No, not the throwing out itself, but the attitude and passive aggressiveness about it. I haven\u2019t read many of him comments, but he said in the title he threw it out because he belt unappreciated. So obv he was looking for some kind praise. \n\nShe\u2019s def an ahole too, they just honestly suck. Just make your food if you wanna, but don\u2019t expect other people to care.", "But in her mind, he put too much time into it and it wasn\u2019t necessary. He\u2019s making it overly complicated. Why would she respect that? Would he respect her for taking four days to do a load of laundry?", "She never said it was dumb. And I would\u2019ve been fine if the OP decided to keep the pizza for himself. But he threw it away like a child.", "It\u2019s not about the person doing the laundry; it\u2019s about the person the laundry is being done for. That\u2019s the comparison. The wife does not care about the pizza crust and the person who used the laundry analogy does not care about the laundry either. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are people who are passionate about the laundry, making sure that the whites are with the whites and the colors are with the colors, and using all the right fabric softeners and other enhancements to make the optimum laundry load.", "read [this](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/RSxscqMza8)for me buddy", "And? The argument still didn't stem or start from that. \n\nThe argument started from her shitting over the food he was creating. Saying it's a waste of time and that cheap ready made dough tastes better. \n\nI guarantee if she just left it and said \"oh ok\" and walked out (i.e. still not being appreciative), he would not have been upset and thrown the food out.", "But reading through the story, he gets annoyed and chucks the dough after she complains about how long it takes, and that she prefers cheap no effort pizza. \n\nIf she didn't shit all over it after she found out what he was doing, he wouldn't have got annoyed.", "But she did care about it, or she wouldn't have involved herself. All she needed to do was keep her mouth shut and let him enjoy himself.", "Honestly, why does it matter what she thinks? It\u2019s not food that she dislikes, or is allergic to, or has even previously TRIED in that style of cooking. All she has to do is eat, and it wasn\u2019t even for dinner that night so the complaint that it was \u201ctaking too long\u201d is worthless because it\u2019s not like she was hungry right that second and his cooking style was starving her.", "Apples and oranges.\n\nSome fresh cooking needs longer, to taste better.\nYou can make a fresh bolognese from scratch and eat in directly, but it won\u2019t taste like a bolognese, beeing cooked for minimum 3h.\n\nThe laundry won\u2019t just look better after 4 days, now you could say, but i can wash more at once, which would be a valid argument.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want to wait, she should do her own fucking meals.", "Because cooking isn\u2019t just a chore, for some it\u2019s a hobby? I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s hobby is doing laundry but if I wasn\u2019t in desperate need to clean clothes and my partner was really into laundry science and had some 3 day way to make my clothes really clean and smell nice then whatever, it doesn\u2019t actually affect me that much, my partner is happy, and I get clean clothes out of it. Partners don\u2019t have to like or even really understand each other\u2019s hobbies but they should at least respect and support them.\n\nEdit: typo", "Cooking is an art. Laundry is not. There is no benefit to letting clothes sit in a washer for 3 days before you dry them. They'll just smell like mold and you'll need to rewash them. There is a potential benefit to cold rising pizza dough, if you enjoy that type of crust. She doesn't respect the art because she doesn't understand it, but the least she can do is know what she doesn't know. She doesn't cook the food, so maybe shut the fuck up about how it's made since you're eating without expensing any effort.", "She said she didn't like that because it was too complicated. She conveyed the sentiment that she thought it was dumb. She doesn't understand or appreciate the technique, which is fine as long as she doesn't offer unsolicited, unnecessary commentary. If she only cared about the end result, she would have kept her cake hole shut and just enjoyed the meal she didn't have to make for herself.", "You\u2019re not making any sense.", "Fair point", "Or he could just cook what and how he wants without a desperate need for appreciation.", "You\u2019ve clearly never heard of laundry stripping.", "Saying something is too complicated is not the same as saying it\u2019s dumb. Besides, saying \u201cit\u2019s dumb,\u201cstings a lot harder than other words that may be used to convey the same sentiment. She didn\u2019t say it was dumb, so it\u2019s unfair to put that on her. That is your interpretation.", "Or the wife could just shut the fuck up and don\u2019t talk down on him.\n\nSee goes both ways?", "I have, and it's totally unnecessary if you do laundry properly. It's really only meant for towels and bed sheets, and only when they've been affected by the overuse of detergents and other products. If you use the correct amount of detergent and don't overload your machine, you'll never have to strip laundry. Even then, it takes an extra few hours, not days, and it only gets done once in a very long while.", "But what if SHE wanted to make the four day dough pizza and he responded the same way. Would it be okay?", "That's dumb is how a 4 year old conveys they don't like something. She seems to have the same level of maturity so I paraphrased. And nothing is too complicated when you aren't the one doing it."]}
