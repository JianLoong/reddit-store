I have some pretty serious restrictions during recovery. The big ones are that I can't lift anything over 10 lbs and I can't bend over for the next month.\n\nMy husband(40m)'s parents(~70) came cross country to help us take care of our kids(4.5 yo & 10 mo) while I'm healing. We don't have any friends or family nearby and the inlaws are available. My MIL can be really helpful but she's also really spacey and dismissive of our household \"rules\"\n\nTypically I prefer to have a few days with MIL to show her the ropes before handing things over. And even after \"initiation\" I still find her feeding my son cake for breakfast or letting him use permanent markers over the carpet so I keep an eye on her.\n\nWell, this time I am not able to do that so I asked my husband to take off the first few days post surgery to help me with stuff I need and to ease his mom into things with the kids. I'm also really tired of being the \"bad guy\" with MIL and would really prefer it if he could do more of the limit setting. He knows this.\n\nToday, day 2 post-op, I am able to be up a bit more and each time I find my husband is no where to be found while MIL is doing all the work with baby and 4yo is running wild. Anyway, I went to lay down and rest. I was down for maybe 20 min and all I hear is the baby crying. So I get out of bed to see what's up. MIL is trying to soothe the teething baby by... Tossing her into the air and yelling WOO! into her face really loudly? And my husband is playing video games in the basement... Again. So I go down and tell him that the baby has been crying for a while. I reminded him that he's supposed to be in charge of helping his parents take care of the kids, that he should be upstairs with them. He got upset that I was pulling him away from his video game and I told him he could do what he wanted after the baby went to bed in an hour.\n\nSo he comes upstairs. Between when I went down to talk to him and when we came upstairs MIL gave the baby a teething ring and baby calmed down. My husband turns to me, right in front of his mom and says \"Well it looks like she's calm now.\" I shoot him dagger eyes trying to cut him off. But he continued \"And she doesn't SEEM like she's been crying for half an hour.\"\n\nNow I'm pissed. I tell him we need to chat in the bedroom. I lost it. I was yelling at him pretty loudly, asking him why he would put me on the spot like that? That I was trying to be discrete and had explained to him what I wanted from him while we were alone. I yelled that I was pissed because... he was taking his anger out on me because I took him away from his video game to care for the baby... And he got petty making me look like an asshole in front of his mom. That I'm supposed to be in bed but I'm having to micromanage a husband who thinks he's on vacay now that Mom is here to take care of everything. So?

I know the general consensus here is that he's an asshole, but honestly I feel like you could loosen up a little bit because you come off semi controlling. You should be able to trust your in laws more than you do. I get they're not doing EXACTLY what you want, but these 70 yr old folks raised your husband and it's not their first rodeo. As long as their not doing something that's traumatic for your kids or straight up neglecting them just try and relax and focus on your recovery your kids are going to be fine. They're 70 yr olds they don't need to be micromanaged and all it's doing is putting stress on you. They don't follow the \"rules\" and therefore she's spacey? Grandparents will give kids cake for breakfast it's OK your kid isn't going to collapse because he has some cake for breakfast. One of the best parts of having grandparents is being spoiled and breaking a few rules set by our parents.", "Thanks.", "Lol you'll be shocked to hear that he doesn't get donuts for breakfast either!", "This one got me. Lol", "I hear you! I was a sahm for 15 years, and now that I work again, I\u2019ve had to totally let go of my expectations for the house.

The last thing I need is to have her trying to feed the baby food that the baby can't chew/swallow and the baby ends up choking. I'm happy they are here and after MIL gets reacquainted with caring for a baby things are usually ok. But I'm not staking my baby's life on her remembering all by herself. Which is why my husband was supposed to be watching his Mom.", "No he didn't. He said that it doesn't look like the baby is crying and doesn't look like the baby has been crying for any hour.\n\nGaslighting would be if he said that the baby had never been crying, she was crazy for thinking the baby was crying, and is she sure she wasn't hearing things? That she didn't imagine the baby crying??", "No he didn\u2019t , and what he did say isn\u2019t gaslighting.", "You're trying to gaslight me into thinking im wrong about gaslighting!", "Lol what's going on with the downvotes have you guys ever heard of unwanted pregnancies?", "Anyone, amazing or otherwise, would need to \"get used to\" taking care of kids 24/7.

The perfectly fine solution would have been to ask her son who was right there.", "That OP was likely exaggerating how long the crying was or making it up to get him out of the basement.\n\nGaslighting is a very specific tactic. It's not just saying, \"Well I don't believe you,\" or \"I think you're lying.\"\n\nIt's an intentional form of abuse meant to make one doubt their own reality, and be unable to trust their own mind. It needs to be a repetitive process, over a long period of time with the end goal of making the person unable to believe their own experiences and therefore rely on their abuser.\n\nIt is not invalidating an experience or feelings, it is not doubting someone's telling the truth or thinking they made something up.

I was trying to point out that hot mats are a thing every household has and my MIL knows I own but she couldn't be bothered to ask where they are.  This is how she is. She doesn't ask about anything. She's ruined more than one thing around my house because she refuses to ask questions. Anyone who is coming into someone else's household for more than an overnight stay will need to ask questions like \"Where do you store the extra toilet paper?\" But we've had instances where his parents break something because they don't know how to use it and won't ask and even worse, then they don't tell us they broke it. \n\nAnd it's not about the f*cking hot mats. This type of behavior raises serious questions about how well they are going to care for our children when we are out of the room. We can't afford a nanny or daycare at ~$600+/week. No, They aren't complete idiots. And my husband and I are going to be around, so the in-laws are here. It is what it is.

I had a spinal fluid leak after my epidural when I had my son, the blood patch didn\u2019t work. So I had to be laying down for 3 weeks while it healed otherwise I had an excruciating headache as my brain sank down in my skull. My in laws came to help with my 2 year old and the newborn. I was laying down trying to sleep and all I could hear is my 2 year old screaming in the living room for 30 min straight. I got up to find out what the hell was going on, only to find that my MIL insisted my daughter have pigtails and my daughter didn\u2019t want them. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I said but I remember very angrily saying, \u201cThis is NOT the time.\u201d My husband got Al defensive of his mother, as he always does and said, \u201cShe\u2019s just trying to help.\u201d Spoiler Alert! Her \u201chelping\u201d never helps, it just creates triple the work for me. \n\nNTA at all, your husband needs to see your recovery as a priority, not a chance to hang out at home and play video games. You need to tell your in laws your top needs 1. Keep the children quiet while I\u2019m resting 2. Pay enough attention to them that there is no permanent damage to my home.

But my husband agreed to take 3 days off work right after the surgery to take care of me with any health stuff and help his mom get used to the demands of full time child care.

But, as others point out, that means that half the population can't afford live-in help because they ARE the live-in help.", "I understand it\u2019s hard to relinquish the position you normally hold. A big difference here is that being in charge of the household and kids is your day to day responsibility/job. Controlling how others perform your usual job while you\u2019re on leave is not.\n\nHonestly, your husband not eating lunches unless they\u2019re brought to him isn\u2019t a sign of anything. Plenty of people skip meals. It\u2019s not a sign of ineptitude.\n\nYou say not letting your baby cry any longer than absolutely necessary shows you\u2019re caring not controlling. But if that was your true intentions this whole scenario would have gone very differently. You would have provided a helpful outcome and I doubt anything that went down in this post was helpful to anyone but for you to get your controller release/fix for the day. You simply would have walked downstairs and told your MIL how to stop her crying rather than this whole roundabout ridiculousness that went down. Not tear your husband a new one about how he\u2019s not helping his parents how you think he should. \n\nYour judgement machine is running full force right now.

He could have retired two decades ago. Old people are not useless. You\u2019ve decided you already know how poorly your husband is helping his mom right now despite being in bed for the majority of the time? You\u2019ve decided because he\u2019s not handling this how you would, that it\u2019s wrong and bad. Maybe there\u2019s a game plan in there you don\u2019t know about. Maybe not. Either way it\u2019s none of your business right now.\n\nBecause you have one job. No one is coming into your healing space micromanaging your recovery. Your husband would have every right to tell you to get your ass in bed and stop being such a worrywort fusspot because you\u2019re actively failing at doing the ONLY thing  you\u2019re responsible for right now. Caring for yourself and letting others do the work. Your mil flew across the goddamn country to be your free full time nanny while you heal and you won\u2019t let her do that? There\u2019s lots of ways to judge and look at a situation. There\u2019s lots of ways to get self righteous. There\u2019s lots of ways to mask controlling behavior as caring behavior.\n\nJust stop. It\u2019s so freaking obvious looking from the outside in. \n\nSecondly, I\u2019ll reiterate again. It\u2019s simply not your job to be the child caregiver or homemaker right now. The world will not end if baby cries a little longer. The world will not end if grandma pushes herself. The world will not end if your husband spends a few hours gaming. You know what could be closer to world ending? You getting out of bed too soon, stressing, tensing, and screaming while your spinal surgery heals and because you\u2019re failing to to your only job right now (heal) and wind up with an even worse back situation. God forbid paralysis. \n\nYou say he took 3 days off to get them acclimated but his version of helping them acclimate may be different than yours. And that\u2019s allowed.
