I have some pretty serious restrictions during recovery. The big ones are that I can't lift anything over 10 lbs and I can't bend over for the next month.\n\nMy husband(40m)'s parents(~70) came cross country to help us take care of our kids(4.5 yo & 10 mo) while I'm healing. We don't have any friends or family nearby and the inlaws are available. My MIL can be really helpful but she's also really spacey and dismissive of our household \"rules\"\n\nTypically I prefer to have a few days with MIL to show her the ropes before handing things over. And even after \"initiation\" I still find her feeding my son cake for breakfast or letting him use permanent markers over the carpet so I keep an eye on her.\n\nWell, this time I am not able to do that so I asked my husband to take off the first few days post surgery to help me with stuff I need and to ease his mom into things with the kids. I'm also really tired of being the \"bad guy\" with MIL and would really prefer it if he could do more of the limit setting. He knows this.\n\nToday, day 2 post-op, I am able to be up a bit more and each time I find my husband is no where to be found while MIL is doing all the work with baby and 4yo is running wild. Anyway, I went to lay down and rest. I was down for maybe 20 min and all I hear is the baby crying. So I get out of bed to see what's up. MIL is trying to soothe the teething baby by... Tossing her into the air and yelling WOO! into her face really loudly? And my husband is playing video games in the basement... Again. So I go down and tell him that the baby has been crying for a while. I reminded him that he's supposed to be in charge of helping his parents take care of the kids, that he should be upstairs with them. He got upset that I was pulling him away from his video game and I told him he could do what he wanted after the baby went to bed in an hour.\n\nSo he comes upstairs. Between when I went down to talk to him and when we came upstairs MIL gave the baby a teething ring and baby calmed down. My husband turns to me, right in front of his mom and says \"Well it looks like she's calm now.\" I shoot him dagger eyes trying to cut him off. But he continued \"And she doesn't SEEM like she's been crying for half an hour.\"\n\nNow I'm pissed. I tell him we need to chat in the bedroom. I lost it. I was yelling at him pretty loudly, asking him why he would put me on the spot like that? That I was trying to be discrete and had explained to him what I wanted from him while we were alone. I yelled that I was pissed because... he was taking his anger out on me because I took him away from his video game to care for the baby... And he got petty making me look like an asshole in front of his mom. That I'm supposed to be in bed but I'm having to micromanage a husband who thinks he's on vacay now that Mom is here to take care of everything. So?
