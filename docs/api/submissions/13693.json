I have some pretty serious restrictions during recovery. The big ones are that I can't lift anything over 10 lbs and I can't bend over for the next month.\n\nMy husband(40m)'s parents(~70) came cross country to help us take care of our kids(4.5 yo & 10 mo) while I'm healing. We don't have any friends or family nearby and the inlaws are available. My MIL can be really helpful but she's also really spacey and dismissive of our household \"rules\"\n\nTypically I prefer to have a few days with MIL to show her the ropes before handing things over. And even after \"initiation\" I still find her feeding my son cake for breakfast or letting him use permanent markers over the carpet so I keep an eye on her.\n\nWell, this time I am not able to do that so I asked my husband to take off the first few days post surgery to help me with stuff I need and to ease his mom into things with the kids. I'm also really tired of being the \"bad guy\" with MIL and would really prefer it if he could do more of the limit setting. He knows this.\n\nToday, day 2 post-op, I am able to be up a bit more and each time I find my husband is no where to be found while MIL is doing all the work with baby and 4yo is running wild. Anyway, I went to lay down and rest. I was down for maybe 20 min and all I hear is the baby crying. So I get out of bed to see what's up. MIL is trying to soothe the teething baby by... Tossing her into the air and yelling WOO! into her face really loudly? And my husband is playing video games in the basement... Again. So I go down and tell him that the baby has been crying for a while. I reminded him that he's supposed to be in charge of helping his parents take care of the kids, that he should be upstairs with them. He got upset that I was pulling him away from his video game and I told him he could do what he wanted after the baby went to bed in an hour.\n\nSo he comes upstairs. Between when I went down to talk to him and when we came upstairs MIL gave the baby a teething ring and baby calmed down. My husband turns to me, right in front of his mom and says \"Well it looks like she's calm now.\" I shoot him dagger eyes trying to cut him off. But he continued \"And she doesn't SEEM like she's been crying for half an hour.\"\n\nNow I'm pissed. I tell him we need to chat in the bedroom. I lost it. I was yelling at him pretty loudly, asking him why he would put me on the spot like that? That I was trying to be discrete and had explained to him what I wanted from him while we were alone. I yelled that I was pissed because... he was taking his anger out on me because I took him away from his video game to care for the baby... And he got petty making me look like an asshole in front of his mom. That I'm supposed to be in bed but I'm having to micromanage a husband who thinks he's on vacay now that Mom is here to take care of everything. So?

Not even a little bit. Your husband is behaving like a damn child. He weaponized incompetence and tried to gaslight you into making you believe you\u2019re the unreasonable one. You aren\u2019t.

You\u2019re supposed to be getting rest and your husband is a third child. He should be raising his children with help from his parents, not ignoring the family for fun time. He\u2019s TA.", "NTA. Ship the grandparents home and hire a healthcare aide for you and a nanny for the kids. Tell hubby to go back to work because he\u2019s stressing you out.", "NTA.  Please give many thanks to your MIL for stepping in where your husband is not.  His dismissiveness of his child's needs is not ok.", "NTA. Your husband is being lazy.", "NTA.

It\u2019s super gross that your husband lets his mommy and wife suffer so he can game. Like TF? This is one of those things people divorce over. This is one of those times you can\u2019t control your family and you need to worry about healing yourself. Have a follow up conversation with your husband about firm expectations again. This time add, you aren\u2019t attacted to a man who doesn\u2019t take care of his wife and children.

No, they won\u2019t do things like you would but everyone will survive. Take care of yourself and let the other adults take care of the children in whatever way they will.

The only thing you did wrong was marrying a child.", "NTA-\n\nI am glad you had a successful surgery and are able to get up and move around 2 days post op!\n\nThat is so sweet that your MIL traveled across country to help, while you\u2019re not wrong, it\u2019s his mom that is seeing him be lazy and not helping. Hopefully she says something to him! \n\nI think you are being a bit of a micromanager and for the short time of your recovery it will help if you can accept the home will be not ran the exact way you run it and grandparents inherently spoil there grandparents. As long as it\u2019s not blatant disrespect of your rules than you will do best by letting things go.", "NTA. This would be a dealbreaker for me.", "NTA\n\nwhy are you married to him?", "nta - your husband should be playing an active role specifically to remove the idea of all of this from your mind. if i was your spouse, one of my goals for your recovery period would be to see how long i can make you able to forget other responsibilities exist. i wouldn't be playing video games. \n\nTHAT BEING SAID. \n\ni saw your comment about her using your garden gloves because she couldn't find your dish cozy or whatever. it's rude, those aren't her gloves, but she probably just didn't think it was that big of a deal. i would probably have done the exact same thing. \n\nyou said this is one of a ton of different examples. are all of them going to be on par with that? are your biggest concerns here that the kids will be noisy and the house will be a mess? are you worried that the kids will be in real danger? are you worried that the kids will not be fed at all? are you worried for the children's safety? \n\nis your mother in law's help bad, or is it just chaotic? \n\ndo i pity her? absolutely. but my reasoning for commenting all this is that not only are you going to stress the kids out, but you're stressing yourSELF out. and you need to rest or you won't get better. and if you can't get better, then this chaos will be prolonged. \n\npractice some anxiety grounding techniques and adjust your expectations. this will also improve your relationship with your mother in law, who i GUARANTEE wants to please you. she loves the kids. she loves your husband. she loves YOU. everyone there wants you to get better. \n\nyour husband really needs a refresher course in whose side he's on, though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I agree that just because you wouldn't do it that way, doesn't mean it's wrong.\n\nI would suggest identifying some hard nos that you can't compromise on.
