I got pregnant during that time and gave birth to my son a year a half ago. I was going to return to work, and have my parents look after him. However, my parents are overwhelmed and elderly to take on a toddler full time, so I decided not to work and take care of our son.\n\nThis November our home will be completed (there were delays) and we can finally move in. However, my MIL wanted to go back home (China) to see her grandparents and take a vacation with them to Hawaii in November. Since my MIL is recovering from a minor surgery, my husband wanted to accompany her.\n\nI told him 'no' because we're going to move in during that vacation time and we can't pay for two homes (We borrowed a mortgage for renovation and are leasing a place now). He insisted that he needs to go help his mom and this is the last vacation he can travel with his grandparents.\n\nI would be a bit more lenient if that was the reason, however his extended family is going on the trip too (+ 5 people) so there would be plenty of help. I told him that he shouldn't go and that I needed him here. He brushed off my concerns saying that my parents can help with toddler while he is gone and I can manage the renos and moving on my own.\n\nThat turned into a heated argument and he ended the conversion with 'You can't stop me'. Since then he has been stonewalling and not helping me take care of the toddler.\n\nI just don't know what to do now.\n\nInfo: My husband is the type not to speak up about any 'weakness' or 'needs' that he has. I do admit that these last two years, it has been the toddler's needs over his. I myself haven't had much time 'self' time, while he had time for recreation and video games since I take on a majority of the mental load. I don't think it is out of jealously and I know why he wants to see his grandparents since he adores them. It is more along the lines (to my belief) that as a father, his wife and son should be priority. I do understand that he wants to see his grandparents, and if it was any other time, I would have said 'go on a head', but I need him here. It is just bad timing for the vacation and he just wanted to go.\n\nInfo: Yes, we are paying for two homes but we cannot afford it since our mortgage rates have increased and we need to delegate the funds to the new home.\n\nInfo: Initially my parents were going to take care of our toddler until he turns 3. But after taking care of him for a few days straight, they realized it was taking a toll on them, so I took over. However, I really need to work to support the mortgage, but my husband doesn't want to pay for childcare since my parents are retired and can do it for free. I asked him multiple times if his family can help and each time he says no and our conversation ends there.", "created_utc": 1696535093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170rbnc/aita_for_telling_my_husband_not_to_go_on_a/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In a marriage each partner should try to support the other in important matters.  It should not be a contest of the wills with one triumphing over the other as that always leaves one side unhappy.\n\nYou both have valid points.  It does seem that the trip to China is very important to your husband for several reasons, some of them clearly time sensitive.  His duty to his extended family is likely deep seated and something he cannot easily ignore in good conscience.  It seems he has accepted your desire to be a stay-at-home mom and has been covering everything economically adequately so you can do this.  The timing of your move-in and his trip do overlap and for sure that places more responsibility on you.  Is he leaving you to actually do the move physically yourself or providing the funds for you to get help doing the move?  If it is the latter, you can manage even though it will not be as easy as having his help and guidance there.  \n\nI think, if he has otherwise been a considerate and fair partner, that maybe you need to realize the importance of this trip to him and do your best, if possible, to manage the homefront while he is gone.  \n\nAs for his pouting and directing some of this towards your toddler, that's not good and needs to stop. This is no way to resolve a conflict.", "NTA \n\nBut he is. Oh my gawd.\n\nI would be juuust petty enough to go ahead and move in, change the locks while doing it, and tell him he can move in with you when he's ready to be a husband and father.\n\nObviously consult a lawyer before doing anything of the sort, and don't take an internet stranger's word. \n\nBut honestly? He's telling you where you rank in his life. You deserve better. Probably time to look at your options. I'm so sorry he's put you in this position.", "Nta\n\n\nJust the sheer audacity to even THINK about it, let alone actually neglecting his parenting obligations for a temper tantrum. \n\nI feel secondhand embarrassment for his priorities and pathetic toddler tantrum", "No one seems to be addressing the last paragraph, never mind the vacation, he won\u2019t pay for childcare because your parents can do it for free (yet they\u2019re physically not able)????", "NTA - Refusing to help take care of his own child is simply immature and unacceptable.

It doesn't solve your problems,or resolve the issue of why he thinks it is fine to leave you chin deep in responsibilities while he runs off to have fun, but it will give you a little breaktime in the evenings. From the sounds of your schedule, I think you need you time more than he does right now. And he is not going to choose to stay home, obviously. I would push for choice 2. \n\nI would also be looking for unused items to sell off when he is gone. You will need extra money for the move. He is being an asshole", "NTA sounds like you need couples counseling or a divorce next. I'd change the locks on that new house while he's gone, but that's just me.", "Man redditors are as quick to end a marriage as to break up with a boyfriend.  Not everything is a divorce level offense.\n\nThe stonewalling and especially refusing to help with the child is bad.  He should not be doing that.  Having said that, it is obvious that this trip is very important to him and if there is a way to do it you should let it happen.  I don't know if you're of a different culture from him or not but from my understanding the elders are extremely important to chinese people, and he may will feel that if he doesn't go now he may never see the grandparents again.  If he loves them, and he clearly does, not going will be a very hard pill for him to swallow and I suspect if he does not go and his grandparents die before he gets to spend quality time with them he will resent you for it.  You should try very hard to find a way to help him go.\n\nYou could consider asking to hire movers to pack and move you as this will all fall on you with your child and that's a lot.  You could consider asking him to delay the trip and meet with the grandparents in Hawaii to spend the vacation time with them which will allow him more time at home with you before he sees them.  Possibly he could even travel back to China with them and come home after that.  Possibly consider finding someone more knowledgeable than you to oversee the renovations and represent your interests if you are uncomfortable with overseeing the construction.\n\nTry to find a compromise.  And tell him that his anger at you should not be taken out on your child.

How about you start by not treating your husband like a second child. He shouldn't have to ask your permission.

Have you been reciprocal with balancing his needs versus your own over the past, say, two years? Or has it been pretty one-sided with need fulfillment?

Do you understand why this is so important to your husband?", "I\u2019m so sorry.\n\nI feel some of this.\n\nYou might need to let him do his thing\u2026 but only if you can breathe and not use it for future ammunition.\n\nI understand your concerns/fears, etc. Humans are not always rational.\n\nYou are NTA, but please do not use \u201cleniency\u201d in couples talk.

With age I look back and realize that this was unnecessarily hard on my relationships.\n\nWhen you love someone, you want what is best for them.  Some would argue that he should do the same... and maybe... but as with anything it's a matter of prioritizing.  His grandparents are old and likely won't be around for a whole lot longer - and losing this time with them at this stage of their life is something that he may never be able to make up.  That's worth the inconvenience of dealing with a few things on my own for awhile to give someone I love that gift and it is not indicative of him valuing me any less.\n\nI've been downvoted for saying this before... but marriage is not 50/50.  It's 100/100... and sometimes one person's 100% is actually 110% for a short while because that other person needs to take his/her 10% and put it elsewhere.", "Then he can use some more savings to extend your move in date for when he\u2019s back. \n\nAlso why on earth are you paying 50/50 if you\u2019re not working!

You need to shore up your partners weaknesses and they shore up yours, and together, you are always helping each other completely.   It's not about who did what because you both should be doing all you can.", "You are so wise. I wish my husband can see things you do. But I guess that comes with time. I just don't know how to talk to him after he is like this. Every time I approach him after stonewalling, it makes it seems like I'm owning up and admitting that I'm the one at fault and that gives him an ego boost because the stonewalling is working. Even though my intent is to talk it out and resolve the issue.", "Your SO is 31.  How much more time does he need to act like the adult he is instead of a bratty tween he\u2019s acting out?  This might very well be as good as it gets bc he\u2019s not even trying,", "You are not at fault at all, at least at this time.  Feeling like you have to admit fault to reopen a conversation/stop the stonewalling is a troubling pattern.  Fighting, in a marriage, should never be about right or wrong.  It should be about finding solutions.  That being said, it is often easier to see things when you are not emotionally involved - as both you and your husband are. \n\nI do think you need some kind of counselling - not to fix your marriage but to teach you better communication techniques, although that may be a hard sell for him.\n\nI would start by approaching him and telling him that you do understand why this trip is so important to him, but that you do have some concerns about how you are going to manage what is happening in your world right now and would like to have him help you work out how to manage these things.  Then go down your list - and make a few suggestions as to how to resolve them and ask if he has any.  It's better if you can come up with two options yourself for each concern, although not 100% necessary as it can be presented as \"this is what I suggest here... what do you think?\"  Talk about any insecurities/uncertainties you have with regards to things you are uncertain about your abilities to deal with effectively in his absence.\n\nAnd for future discussions \"yes\" or \"no\" only shuts the doors to communication.  Instead go for \"these are the concerns I have, so let's see how we address them/how do you feel about them\" to hopefully facilitate a more open conversation.  It is clear that his parents don't do that - so you will need to approach these in a different way than with someone who has communication skills.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm no expert and this advice is free and may be worth what you paid for it."]}
