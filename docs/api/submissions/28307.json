I got pregnant during that time and gave birth to my son a year a half ago. I was going to return to work, and have my parents look after him. However, my parents are overwhelmed and elderly to take on a toddler full time, so I decided not to work and take care of our son.\n\nThis November our home will be completed (there were delays) and we can finally move in. However, my MIL wanted to go back home (China) to see her grandparents and take a vacation with them to Hawaii in November. Since my MIL is recovering from a minor surgery, my husband wanted to accompany her.\n\nI told him 'no' because we're going to move in during that vacation time and we can't pay for two homes (We borrowed a mortgage for renovation and are leasing a place now). He insisted that he needs to go help his mom and this is the last vacation he can travel with his grandparents.\n\nI would be a bit more lenient if that was the reason, however his extended family is going on the trip too (+ 5 people) so there would be plenty of help. I told him that he shouldn't go and that I needed him here. He brushed off my concerns saying that my parents can help with toddler while he is gone and I can manage the renos and moving on my own.\n\nThat turned into a heated argument and he ended the conversion with 'You can't stop me'. Since then he has been stonewalling and not helping me take care of the toddler.\n\nI just don't know what to do now.\n\nInfo: My husband is the type not to speak up about any 'weakness' or 'needs' that he has. I do admit that these last two years, it has been the toddler's needs over his. I myself haven't had much time 'self' time, while he had time for recreation and video games since I take on a majority of the mental load. I don't think it is out of jealously and I know why he wants to see his grandparents since he adores them. It is more along the lines (to my belief) that as a father, his wife and son should be priority. I do understand that he wants to see his grandparents, and if it was any other time, I would have said 'go on a head', but I need him here. It is just bad timing for the vacation and he just wanted to go.\n\nInfo: Yes, we are paying for two homes but we cannot afford it since our mortgage rates have increased and we need to delegate the funds to the new home.\n\nInfo: Initially my parents were going to take care of our toddler until he turns 3. But after taking care of him for a few days straight, they realized it was taking a toll on them, so I took over. However, I really need to work to support the mortgage, but my husband doesn't want to pay for childcare since my parents are retired and can do it for free. I asked him multiple times if his family can help and each time he says no and our conversation ends there.\n\nInfo: Just for clarification I did not outright say 'no'. I informed him that the vacation period was during the move in/home completion time and that he should prioritize that first. He stayed silent, which meant he understood. However, it was not until that his family finalized the dates that he bought tickets for the trip. He knows how important having our own home with our son is, but as many responses say, I am not that high on his hierchy.", "created_utc": 1696535093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170rbnc/aita_for_telling_my_husband_not_to_go_on_a/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In a marriage each partner should try to support the other in important matters.  It should not be a contest of the wills with one triumphing over the other as that always leaves one side unhappy.\n\nYou both have valid points.  It does seem that the trip to China is very important to your husband for several reasons, some of them clearly time sensitive.  His duty to his extended family is likely deep seated and something he cannot easily ignore in good conscience.  It seems he has accepted your desire to be a stay-at-home mom and has been covering everything economically adequately so you can do this.  The timing of your move-in and his trip do overlap and for sure that places more responsibility on you.  Is he leaving you to actually do the move physically yourself or providing the funds for you to get help doing the move?  If it is the latter, you can manage even though it will not be as easy as having his help and guidance there.  \n\nI think, if he has otherwise been a considerate and fair partner, that maybe you need to realize the importance of this trip to him and do your best, if possible, to manage the homefront while he is gone.  \n\nAs for his pouting and directing some of this towards your toddler, that's not good and needs to stop.

It doesn't solve your problems,or resolve the issue of why he thinks it is fine to leave you chin deep in responsibilities while he runs off to have fun, but it will give you a little breaktime in the evenings. From the sounds of your schedule, I think you need you time more than he does right now. And he is not going to choose to stay home, obviously.

Not everything is a divorce level offense.\n\nThe stonewalling and especially refusing to help with the child is bad.  He should not be doing that.  Having said that, it is obvious that this trip is very important to him and if there is a way to do it you should let it happen.  I don't know if you're of a different culture from him or not but from my understanding the elders are extremely important to chinese people, and he may will feel that if he doesn't go now he may never see the grandparents again.  If he loves them, and he clearly does, not going will be a very hard pill for him to swallow and I suspect if he does not go and his grandparents die before he gets to spend quality time with them he will resent you for it.  You should try very hard to find a way to help him go.\n\nYou could consider asking to hire movers to pack and move you as this will all fall on you with your child and that's a lot.  You could consider asking him to delay the trip and meet with the grandparents in Hawaii to spend the vacation time with them which will allow him more time at home with you before he sees them.  Possibly he could even travel back to China with them and come home after that.  Possibly consider finding someone more knowledgeable than you to oversee the renovations and represent your interests if you are uncomfortable with overseeing the construction.\n\nTry to find a compromise.

Some would argue that he should do the same... and maybe... but as with anything it's a matter of prioritizing.  His grandparents are old and likely won't be around for a whole lot longer - and losing this time with them at this stage of their life is something that he may never be able to make up.

It should be about finding solutions.  That being said, it is often easier to see things when you are not emotionally involved - as both you and your husband are. \n\nI do think you need some kind of counselling - not to fix your marriage but to teach you better communication techniques, although that may be a hard sell for him.\n\nI would start by approaching him and telling him that you do understand why this trip is so important to him, but that you do have some concerns about how you are going to manage what is happening in your world right now and would like to have him help you work out how to manage these things.  Then go down your list - and make a few suggestions as to how to resolve them and ask if he has any.  It's better if you can come up with two options yourself for each concern, although not 100% necessary as it can be presented as \"this is what I suggest here... what do you think?\"  Talk about any insecurities/uncertainties you have with regards to things you are uncertain about your abilities to deal with effectively in his absence.\n\nAnd for future discussions \"yes\" or \"no\" only shuts the doors to communication.  Instead go for \"these are the concerns I have, so let's see how we address them/how do you feel about them\" to hopefully facilitate a more open conversation.

That\u2019s selfish AF and shows exactly where you rank on his priority list!! \n\nOn top of this, you can\u2019t financially afford it but he doesn\u2019t give a shit about that either or the stress you\u2019ll be under! \n\nHe also does nothing to help the daycare situation so that you can go back to work to provide more stability for your family. \n\nI know you just built a house with this man but I\u2019d be consulting an attorney to see what my options were, even just to separate to see if the two of you can even work this out. I\u2019d most definitely suggest marriage counseling asap at the very least!", "NTA\n\nBut do you really want to divorce him at this point in time? I mean, I\u02bbd understand if you wanted to.\n\nCan you go stay with your parents for a while?", "Is there a compromise?  With aging parents and grandparents, it may be important to try to see the grandparents and help MIL with the travel and postpone your move-in a week or so.  How long is the proposed trip and could he go on a shortened version of it?  Does your MIL need help traveling?  Are the grandparents going to Hawaii as well? or are they just planning to visit them in China?  Once in China is there a long travel time to see the grandparents?", "You told him no? You'd be more lenient? He's your husband not your child, and he wants to see his grandparents. That doesn't mean he's placing them above you in a permanent hierarchy. You even said he mentioned that this might be his last chance to travel with them. His response sucks, but that's a different issue entirely and maybe he needs therapy or something to help him learn how to problem solve, but thinking you can straight up tell him no is just as wrong in a relationship.", "You both need to accept the fact that relatives are not willing to provide you with childcare. It sounds like you made a unilateral decision to stay home with your child. You need to go back to work both to help with the mortgage and because your marriage is on shaky ground. A trip to China would be hard to pass up.", "NTA. It\u2019s so beyond selfish of him to leave you alone to move and oversee the completion of renos all while watching a toddler.", "NTA. I understand that he doesn\u2019t want to miss the family trip but to it sounds bad and he needs to take care of obligations at home first.

People from the Asian culture are very family oriented. They usually highly respect their parents and grandparents. Being this might be the last time they would be able to all be together would make this make this trip more meaningful. Also going from a 2 income to a 1 income would be highly stressful. Being told no straight out is not a good way to begin negotiations. I would have said could he stay part of vacation with you and the other half with his parents. I would say you both ate part ah ..learn how to communicate better.", "NTA. My husband was invited on a trip when we were closing on our house. I told him that any other time would work but he was needed at home during that time.

Since then he has been stonewalling and not helping me take care of the toddler.\n\nThis really stood out to me. No sane adult should be this petty that they don't care for their own child to piss you off/win the argument. \n\n>but my husband doesn't want to pay for childcare since my parents are retired and can do it for free. I asked him multiple times if his family can help and each time he says no and our conversation ends there.\n\nFirst, your husband is insisting that your parents care for your child because he sees them as free babysitters. When your parents tell you they can't care for your child, then they should immediately be removed as one of the options to care for your child. Find someone else or tell husband to invest in babysitters. \n\nAlso, what hypocrisy is this. He won't even consider his family to babysit and just ends the conversation?\n\nYour relationship seems so unbalanced. He seems to have all the power, at least that's the way it sounds in your post. I get it, I also come from a culture where misogyny is still prominent, but this is borderline abuse.\n\nI will mention that your husband maybe has a secret reason he is insisting on going on this trip, and just using his mom's health as an excuse, since you mentioned there are 5 plus people going too. It could be that he just really wants to get away from his adult responsibilities at the expense of your finances and your wishes. Or maybe he just has really bad FOMO. Or there is another reason husband is not disclosing. \n\nYou know your situation and your husband better than anyone here, but all I can say is think things through.  What is your future going to be like with your husband. It sounds like he's always going to put his family above you and your child, even going as far as to dismiss your parents' health.", "What to do now?

OP NTA but look seriously at your relationship,  your husband is totally wrong, this is not the way to manage his family.", ">So, he's having a mad and refusing to help take care of his own child.\n\nThis alone makes the husband a huge AH. Even silent treatment is unwelcoming, but to be so immature and petty they he doesn't take care of his child to piss off his wife is a new level of assholeness.", "Worse than that, if a person knows they cannot physically provide daycare for a, presumably, active toddler why on earth would you demand they care for your child regardless? It doesn\u2019t matter if their grandparents or not, if they can\u2019t do the job/task in question forcing them to do it will not only harm them, it will also negatively impact the child. \n\nDoes OP\u2019s husband not care that his son won\u2019t get the care he deserves? Clearly it\u2019s not the grandparent\u2019s fault that they are physically unable to look after the kid all week, every week - they even tried before recognising and sharing their limitations, which is more than fair and reasonable. I would never have left my kids, when they were younger, with a person who was not going to able to do the task at hand. It would be a dereliction on my part, a disservice to my child and their grandparents. It\u2019s fundamentally unsafe to force such a scenario. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not even touching the level of entitlement you rightly point out. \n\nOP, I would be worried sick if the father of my children expressed so little regard for the safety and welfare of our children - let alone the egregious sense of entitlement. You are NTA, and it\u2019s hard to see your marriage withstanding the disrespect your husband shows. Unless you plan on giving in to him every single time, regardless of any safety concerns?", "OP should act like her husband. While her husband is on vacation, she should enroll the kid in daycare so she can handle the move and find a job. If he doesn't have any consideration for her and her family, why should his opinions be considered?", "I would NOT send my child to China without me\u2014especially when the child\u2019s father is so tied to whatever his mother and family wants.

It's not that great lately. After our argument, he has been stonewalling me for a week. When I am taking care of our toddler he is either playing video games and taking naps after work, which infuriate me. I just pretend he's invisible until I figure the next steps. But thank you for your concern.", "Sexism is also hella important to the chinese culture. Not sure why \u201celder respect\u201d hasta mean the partner gets the shit end of the stick and has to compromise on having to do all the work for this.", "This.

I would like to add,  please explain to your husband, OP,  that your parents are unable to help due to their own age and limitations.\n\nTell him you understand him not wanting to spend money, but in order for him to go on the trip, and for you to be able to take care of everything, and especially your toddler, you will have no choice but to hire someone to help you.\n\nI think that could be the best compromise. If he's not willing to agree, ask him why he is so willing to impose such a hardship on you.\n\nHe seems to forget how much time and energy an 18 month old toddler can take.\n\nDepending on his response, you can then decide what you want to do.\n\nNTA", "He's going for 2.5 almost 3 weeks. \nThe husband is going there to help MIL carry her bags and other things. \nYes, the whole paternal family is going to Hawaii.

If he doesn\u2019t want to pay for childcare, makes his stay at home spouse pay half the bills (wild), and then refuses to take care of his own child while stonewalling you, what exactly does he bring to the table? If he makes his non-working wife pay half the mortgage (still wild), he is not supporting his family.\n\nY\u2019all are gonna need marriage counseling.

You have way more patience with this than I would. He\u2019s been mistreating you even before this issue came up. \n\nFrankly, I think you are approaching the time for ultimatums. \u201cIf you are leaving town on vacation while we planned to move, understand that means that you need to deal with all of the moving on your own ahead of your departure. If you don\u2019t take care of this responsibility, the locks will be changed when you return.\u201d I would start looking for daycares and call around to find movers who are available. Start sending your resume out as well. If he leaves you without addressing moving, I would pull everything out of your bank account and use that to prepay for daycare and get a job asap. Get movers to move you. He can ask his family for money while traveling. That\u2019s so unacceptable that he would leave you to cope on your own with figuring out how to move everything yourself (while presumably not spending a cent to hire help). This makes me so mad to read this", "Your SO is not a toddler but a 31yo. Time won\u2019t change him. Time made him. Accept him for the shtty person he is at your expense or move on.

He is making it very clear that you and your son are so far down the priority list; You don't know why you should stay in a marriage like this, and you absolutely hate that feeling.  He doesn't need to go. He wants to go, but there is not a NEED to go.  He is choosing to go have fun and leave all the work up to you as well as caring for his and your son.  Then tell him (because you said he will definitely go) that when he gets back, he needs to be prepared because you both are going to marraige counseling; because you nor your joint child will ever come last again.  When you get married,  you become your own family, and everyone else then becomes extended family, including parents. Some couples have trouble setting that tone, but once they do, couples rarely argue.  In-laws sometimes don't take it well, but that is their problem, not yours.
