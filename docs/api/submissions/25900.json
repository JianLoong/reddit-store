And please report this to the pool administration. Make sure they understand how uncomfortable you are.  The lifeguard or manager should be throwing the kid and her mom out. Jumping on strangers in a public pool is never okay.  In fact, jumping at all is probably against the rules.\n\nThis is a dangerous situation for you. In today's world, this situation could destroy your life. If this child or her mother make false allegations, it would be a child and her disabled mom against a man.  \n\nEven if the situation is completely absurd and no one in their right mind would believe it, you will still be that guy who was accused.  And the world is lousy with people not in their right mind.\n\nIt's also a very dangerous situation for the girl.  Not all strangers are safe.", "NTA. Unwanted physical contact with someone else\u2019s child, even if it\u2019s the child throwing herself at you and not you touching her, can bring on all sorts of horrible consequences for you. You have to protect yourself. But snapping at her mother probably won\u2019t do anything. File a complaint with the management. Life guards won\u2019t do anything \u2014 they are usually young and afraid of confronting adults. Get these two banned from the pool, if you have to.", "NTA, OP, that child's behavior is unacceptable & her Mom needs to step up and be a parent.

Some child jumped on her whilst she was holding her 2 yr old g daughter.  The kid hit her wrong causing a neck problem which made her scream in pain, drop the g daughter, huge fuss.  2 months later she was still having physio paid for mostly by the neglecting parent, who was banned for a while.", "NTA. This is pretty serious given what's she's doing. Talk to both the parent and the lifeguard. That kid needs to stop touching other people in the pool or she's going to accidentally drown or hurt someone one of these times.", "NTA \n\nNeed to have staff tell mom to reel that physical aggressive kid in and/or cancel their lessons/swim time. \n\nI'm female and if some strange male child did this to me, I would exit and file a complaint.\n\nYou are not wrong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
