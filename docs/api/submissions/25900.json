And please report this to the pool administration. Make sure they understand how uncomfortable you are.  The lifeguard or manager should be throwing the kid and her mom out. Jumping on strangers in a public pool is never okay.  In fact, jumping at all is probably against the rules.\n\nThis is a dangerous situation for you. In today's world, this situation could destroy your life. If this child or her mother make false allegations, it would be a child and her disabled mom against a man.  \n\nEven if the situation is completely absurd and no one in their right mind would believe it, you will still be that guy who was accused.

Unwanted physical contact with someone else\u2019s child, even if it\u2019s the child throwing herself at you and not you touching her, can bring on all sorts of horrible consequences for you. You have to protect yourself. But snapping at her mother probably won\u2019t do anything. File a complaint with the management.

My point is that the behavior is bad regardless of the genders and he can lodge a complaint without mentioning it.

Some child jumped on her whilst she was holding her 2 yr old g daughter.

Wtf?! \n\nOP, you are so NTA. \n\nDefinitely snap at that parent. Tell her loudly you are uncomfortable then escalate to whatever personnel works there. She is still a parent, her mobility limitation doesn't give her a free pass when it comes to enforcing boundaries with her child. It's unfortunate she isn't able to get in the pool, but that's just an activity the child needs to do with someone else if she can't fully parent from outside the water.", "NTA ...

There can be questions about a lot of situations but your has gone way beyond any reasonable questions when you say that this child is jumping on you and not stopping when you request. Once you\u2019ve told them AND you\u2019ve told their parent that you want their child to stop violating your space or your child\u2019s space and they continue doing it I don\u2019t see anything wrong with telling off the other parent if done appropriately to the situation. For instance, if your telling off of the other parent and the other child has no idea what\u2019s going on that\u2019s fine. If you\u2019re telling off the other parent and your child or the other child appear frightened, begin crying uncontrollably, etc. then you\u2019ve gone too far.

The third time would have been a faux-rage roar of \"Get off me and get away!\"  And then calling for someone in authority to remove the child and her negligent, neglectful mother from the pool.  That child is endangering herself by throwing herself at random people and her mother apparently just doesn't care enough to bother with her. That being the case, it falls to someone else to scare the whey out of her so that maybe she doesn't actually end up getting badly hurt. It should fault on her mother to tell her that not all people are safe to approach like that, not you. You need to protect yourself against potential false allegations of wrongdoing. Additionally, you were supposed to be looking after your child in the pool, not taking care of someone else's.", "Unfortunately, gender does play a role. It shouldn't, but it just does. Patriarchal thinking also hurts men, especially in situations like this.", "It is CRAZY that you dont see what this has to do with gender. As a man who has worked with children, we arent trusted around kids the same way women are. Thats just reality in our culture. Women are supposed to watch the kids, men who show too much interest in doing so often have to earn trust that women are given implicitly"]}
