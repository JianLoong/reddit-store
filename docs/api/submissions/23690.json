How insulting and dismissive towards her sister whose entire life has now been ruined. Let her cry.

The situation there was even more blatantly his dad's fault (drunk driving), but in his experience, the fallout, arguing about blame, and divorce that immediately followed did not make his recovery any easier. \n\nIs it true that your friend is the reason a car accident happened? Yes, sadly. She absolutely needed that \"meant to be\" nonsense nipped in the bud too, but she must know it's her fault already.

Driving safely is everyone's responsibility. \n\nHowever. Situations like this are emotionally complex. It's highly likely that Jessica is dealing with guilt over contributing to the cause of the wreck, and also survivor's guilt, i.e. wondering why her sister was injured, and not her. Her comment that \"it was meant to be\" could also bring a complicated religious component into it.\n\nAll of your friends are aware on some level that she's likely feeling this way, because that's how they would feel if they were in her situation, and they are empathizing with her. And so they know that one of her friends - you, in this case -  bringing up that she is to blame for the accident will not only bring these emotions up to the surface and upset her deeply, but also is not helpful in any way. Jessica likely knows she is somewhat responsible. And if she does not, then it's not your responsibility to make it clear to her - especially so close to the accident, where she may not be mentally able to even accept such a fact. You have no right and no reason to force her to confront that kind of guilt. \n\nTherefore, in everyone else's eyes, what you did was needlessly cruel.

The only thing you\u2019re doing is making sure people are miserable", "NTASTA", "YTA While regular car maintenance is crucial, most people are reliant on modern alert systems to keep them aware of hazards. No one performs a multi-point inspection every time they drive. While this may be something that you are hyper aware of, most people aren't. You also don't say what happened with the tires. Was it a blowout? That could be mechanical failure, debris impact, or tire wear. 2 of those she would not be able to check for. Was it bad tires on compromised roads? Well I doubt she is calculating variable coefficients of friction. This isn't just about social cues. This is about learning and remembering that the parts of life that are second nature to you are frequently not going to be for others, so you need to remember to ask (typically privately) before you open your mouth and insert your foot into it. You also should have apologized immediately. That is a skill that autistic or not everyone should learn.
