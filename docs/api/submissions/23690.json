Purely because you only called her out, when she was making excuses, making it sound like what happened to her sister was a good thing and she was a lucky bystander of chance. You didn't just out right say it.", "YTA but you\u2019re completely right imo, I can\u2019t stand people who don\u2019t take care of their cars as if driving is something they should be allowed to do no matter how dangerous their habits are or how subpar their vehicles capabilities are.", "NTA. It was mean, but not wrong. Gross she even tried to deflect blame off herself so quickly though.", "NTA. My best friend was a paraplegic due to an accident caused by someone else's negligence. He spent the next 23 years of his life in a constant painful hell, until he finally succumbed to an infection caused by his injuries. Your friend is a bitch that should be forced to take care of her sister for the rest of her life.", "Ngl if she\u2019s a wreckless driver then she deserved to hear it, she\u2019s got to live with what she\u2019s done yeah but her sister has to live with what she caused", "YTA that is not something you say ever. She already felt that way and didn\u2019t need you to confirm that. She has to live with the fact that she hurt her sister, that her sister has a new normal. You need to apologize for being insensitive. I also suggest classes for social etiquette, autism is not an excuse to be an ass. My cousin can be harsh at times but his mom explains and has him in classes. You should do the same to learn how to communicate.", "I might get down voted but it's a hard NTA from me. This woman needed a reality check, and giving her that was far more important than tip toeing around her feelings. My answer would be different had she showed some remorse or at least just kept quiet. But to actually say the accident was \"meant to be\"!! How insulting and dismissive towards her sister whose entire life has now been ruined. Let her cry. At the very least maybe through crying, OP's words will get through to her and she won't be negligent like that again. Who knows OP, you may have even saved another person (or people) from ending up paraplegic or even dead at her hands.", "Nta \u201cmeant to be\u201d ?! Like really ?", "I think that YTA. It might be true, however it is not your place as her friend to deliver such harsh truths. She will be dealing with this guilt for the rest of her life most likely, she on her own time will understand her mistakes.", "YTA - Your assumption that Jessica is at fault is just an assumption based on second hand info.  I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have all the information - you didn\u2019t investigate the accident scene, did you?  You should stay out of her business; that shouldn\u2019t be hard now, because I\u2019m guessing she won\u2019t want anything to do with you after this.  You were arrogant and cruel, and being autistic is not an excuse for how you behaved.", ">if she regularly checked her tires her sister would be completely fine but because of her ignorance she got her sister paralyzed.\n\nEvery modern car - that is, every car in America manufactured after September 1, 2007 - has been required to have a tire pressure monitoring system installed that gives an alert to the driver when one tire is 25% lower than the manufacturer recommends.  If you have that warning light on and you drive somewhere other than to the nearest air hose, everything tire-related that happens after that is your fault.\n\nOP is clumsy, but NTA. Jessica, on the other hand, deserves the blame.\n\n---\n\nI added this edit to another comment to another poster, but I want to put it here in my top-level comment as well:  \nEDIT to add: If OP is to be believed, Jessica said the accident was \"meant to be\" or something substantially similar. No, it was not. Something is meant to be if a boulder rolls into the road or if a tree branch falls and splinters puncture your tire. Low tire pressure is otherwise not \"meant to be.\" That's just a dodge.", "YTA. It might be true. But it was still awful to say.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You expected your former friend to  process the accident and accept responsibility her role in causing lifelong harm to her sister extremely quickly. \n\nYou didn't help her to mentally process her thoughts about avoiding or taking responsibility. You assigned blame before she had an opportunity to preloaded her thoughts about accountability. You didn't help her.\n\nSo aside from you, who benefited from those words leaving your mouth?", "YTA. She has to live with the fact that she caused her sister to never walk again. Ever. You do not need to throw that in her face. Doing so is just cruel and unnecessary.", "YTA... very few people regularly check their tire pressure. If this was the reason for her car accident then you were overly harsh. \nIf it was careless dangerous driving then maybe.", "You specifically said \"couldn't hold the urge\". \n\nYou knew it was wrong, and are trying to use autism to hide behind as an excuse. \n\nDouble YTA.", "ESH\n\nIt's absolutely on her to have checked the tire pressure and maintained it, but my goodness, that is not the way to respond (although your friend is absolutely the bigger asshole here). \n\nMy husband became paraplegic after a car accident where his dad was the driver. The situation there was even more blatantly his dad's fault (drunk driving), but in his experience, the fallout, arguing about blame, and divorce that immediately followed did not make his recovery any easier. \n\nIs it true that your friend is the reason a car accident happened? Yes, sadly. She absolutely needed that \"meant to be\" nonsense nipped in the bud too, but she must know it's her fault already. A simple \"you know that isn't true\" or \"the accident was preventable\" would have been a more tactful way to day the same thing.", "ESH. \n\nIf Jessica is indeed a reckless driver, that makes her an asshole. Driving safely is everyone's responsibility. \n\nHowever. Situations like this are emotionally complex. It's highly likely that Jessica is dealing with guilt over contributing to the cause of the wreck, and also survivor's guilt, i.e. wondering why her sister was injured, and not her. Her comment that \"it was meant to be\" could also bring a complicated religious component into it.\n\nAll of your friends are aware on some level that she's likely feeling this way, because that's how they would feel if they were in her situation, and they are empathizing with her. And so they know that one of her friends - you, in this case -  bringing up that she is to blame for the accident will not only bring these emotions up to the surface and upset her deeply, but also is not helpful in any way. Jessica likely knows she is somewhat responsible. And if she does not, then it's not your responsibility to make it clear to her - especially so close to the accident, where she may not be mentally able to even accept such a fact. You have no right and no reason to force her to confront that kind of guilt. \n\nTherefore, in everyone else's eyes, what you did was needlessly cruel. You may be factually correct, but the only thing you accomplished was deeply hurting your friend. You should apologize to her and also to everyone in your friend group for a very insensitive comment, and even then they may not forgive you.", "You can be right but also an asshole.  You were an asshole stating facts.", ">she said something like it was meant to be \n\nNTA. Jessica deserves to be called out. Someone who is feeling guilty will not tell that their sister was meant to be a paraplegic, especially after their callous disregard led to the accident.", "NTA.  Maybe you could have handled it better, but I don't know if I could, and I am autistic as well.  \n\nIf she had a little empathy/sympathy for the situation, Y T A would sound appropriate.", "YTA. You say reckless driving in the post but in the comments said it was the tire pressure so that\u2019s not the same thing. And while her comment was inappropriate it\u2019s been 2 weeks and she\u2019s probably still coping/not reacting possibly/in denial. You had no reason to say something that cruel. It wasn\u2019t necessary or helpful.", "Nta- while it was not the best way to phrase it the fact that your friend has a history of reckless driving, apparently wasn\u2019t performing regular maintenance on her car, and then had the gall to say that her sister becoming a paraplegic was meant to be, makes her a huge AH. \n\nShe definitely needed a wake up call that this was her fault, and she needs to stop trying to push it to the side like it was just the will of God or some nonsense.\n \nAnd for the people who are acting like you said the worst thing ever, ask them if they feel safe riding in a car with her driving?", "ESH She seems to dismiss the accident like it was nothing, you were purposely cruel. Forgetting to check tyre pressure isn\u2019t quite the same as driving drunk or speeding", "How exactly did low tire pressure cause such a severe accident?", "*So quickly*\n\nThe fact that the accident was only 2 weeks ago is part of the reason OP is TA.\n\nDenial is a psychological defense mechanism. And it's an unconscious process. \n\nOP tried to force her former corned to recognize something that the friend was not able or ready to process.", "You did see the part where his friend said that \u201cit was meant to be\u201d. As in her sister, becoming paralyzed, was meant to be.? someone needed to give her a reality check.", "The problem is, the friend doesn\u2019t feel guilty. The Friend said \u201cit was meant to be\u201d. She\u2019s not taking responsibility for her reckless behavior.", "I don't think it's unnecessary.  It might even prevent her from being similarly careless and having another accident and causing another person to end up a paraplegic or even die. Her saying \"it's meant to be\" was so dismissive and insulting towards her sister.", "NTA i disagree, she was deflecting blame and said that it was \u201cmeant to be\u201d which is such a shitty thing to say if it obviously could have been avoided. she needed to hear it, life isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows if the sister flew out the windshield and died she would be charged. if you make your sister a paraplegic YTA!", "They had to do an emergency stop to avoid a collision, the Low tire pressure affect the braking distances and provided  less responsiveness steering and handling and as a result they got into the accident.", "Doesn\u2019t make what he said okay. She may be trying to find the good side, but no one regularly checks their tires. I know I don\u2019t, I make sure I take my car in, but I\u2019m not checking my tires everytime I get in. Their comment still makes them a asshole regardless", "You can give a reality check without being a dick.", "In my opinion she is likely in a state of shock or denial. I dont know her personally so i cant definitely confirm that tho", "The accident was 2 weeks ago.\n\nNot everyone can process something as complex as \"my actions seriously harmed another person and I will have to live with that knowledge for the rest of my life\" in two weeks.", "That means the accident wasn't caused by reckless driving, but by a mechanical issue. That's not *at all* what you said in your post.\n\nSo even if this could have been avoided by better maintenance, it's factually inaccurate to describe it as being Jessica's fault, so you were wrong on top of saying something that was unnecessarily cruel.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Big time.\n\nCalling her a reckless driver implies that she was doing something bad while driving like swerving or didn't have her lights on. This sounds more like a freak accident that could have happened to anybody, regardless of their tire pressure. So YTA for blaming her. \n\nEven if she was doing one of those things and full on caused the accident then you'd still be at fault for throwing it in her face like that when she's down. What happened to her sister is very serious and she needs friends who can comfort her and help her cope with what happened, not treat her like dirt and make her feel worse. So double YTA.", "How was it determined the low tire pressure was the cause of the crash?", "No one checks their tyres every time but responsible people do check their tyres depending on mileage at regular intervals. Also, what is the good side to a person ending up paraplegic? And if there is any, it's upto that person, the injured party, to find it. The person who *caused* the accident going around saying \"it was meant to be\" is just so awful beyond words.", "> by a mechanical issue.\n\nAn easily-corrected mechanical issue that displays on the dashboard of any car manufactured in the last 15 years, which accounts for [about 75 percent of all vehicles](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/25percent-of-cars-in-us-are-at-least-sixteen-years-old----record-high.html).  And even if the car did not have TPMS, a driver should know what low tires look like, and if low tire pressure affects braking distance that much, then you've got pancake tires and it's visible.\n\nI do not sympathize with Jessica's plight.  Unsafe cars are the drivers' responsibility.\n\nEDIT to add: If OP is to be believed, Jessica said the accident was \"meant to be\" or something substantially similar.  No, it was not.  Something is meant to be if a boulder rolls into the road or if a tree branch falls and splinters puncture your tire.  Low tire pressure is otherwise not \"meant to be.\"  That's just a dodge."]}
