By our marriage we agreed to buy a new house 50/50 and I told my husband that one of my requests is to find a house that that has enough rooms for couples to have separate individual rooms not just the master bedroom. He agreed with it he said I can just have a separate room of my own and  the master room will be his alone time while I am away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo our house has 3 bedrooms, the master bedroom, my own bedroom and K\u2019a bedroom. K\u2019s bedroom and my bedroom are same size while the master bedroom is the bigger one. K upon discovering that I have \u201c2 rooms\u201d threw tantrum. I took time to explain to her that my individual bedroom is something I use for myself personal time because the master bedroom is a shared room just like how she uses her bedroom for her personal time because the living area is a shared area.She still didn\u2019t agree and wanted to have access to my room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The thing is my room is basically where my lingeries and sexy undergarments are stored, Ik a 15 years old is aware of their existence but I don\u2019t feel comfortable having her seeing them. Also I do most of my housework (I am a teacher) in this room which I prefer to be alone to focus. She never gave me a good reason to wanna be in my room (cause there isn\u2019t) so I told her that she can stay in my room if she agreed on me staying in hers but she ,obviously, refused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband though told me I should just have her with me and not \u201ctighten my head on silly stuff\u201d which I took offense too because what I was doing is teaching her the basis of privacy that I am entitled to my own room and privacy just as her because she clearly has it in her mind that I am not entitled to any privacy as much as she does hence she wants to be in my room but doesn\u2019t want me in her room. I told my husband he should be with me on teaching her boundaries and that in order to have her boundaries respected she has to respect other\u2019s boundaries even those who she live with instead of giving her a leeway to get whatever she wants by tantrums.
