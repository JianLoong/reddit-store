We've been together for 12 years and I have gone with her 3 times. The last couple times she has gone with our kid, but I have not gone. Between flights (we have airline miles but it covers only about half of the flight costs), other transportation there, eating out, etc, she claims to spend about $2000 when she goes. She is pissed at me because she thinks I should give her, if not half a good amount toward these trips. My point is, I am not going, I am not enjoying the experience, I shouldn't have to. If I one day take my kid on a trip just the two of us I wouldn't expect any help with the cost.
