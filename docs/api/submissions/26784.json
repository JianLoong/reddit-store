She is pissed at me because she thinks I should give her, if not half a good amount toward these trips. My point is, I am not going, I am not enjoying the experience, I shouldn't have to. If I one day take my kid on a trip just the two of us I wouldn't expect any help with the cost.

If she is going on a shopping trip with her girlfriends, then that is her expense.\n\nI see some deeper issues here.  It sounds to me like you are holding yourself separate from your wife.

Same goes with your child, certainly nice if you want to help him take a nice (apparently weeks long?) vacation, but not obligated to.

Marriage is a compromise and it sounds like the wife isn't compromising.", "It doesn\u2019t matter in the specific context of your relationship with your ex, which is just relevant to you.", "But is love practical? Will they both have the same jobs? Standard of living etc?", "Because the reality where they would make fuck all money and she prefers the benefits of living here even with the inconvenience.", "I'm sure they will be able to get comparable jobs in South America...", "He does help her connect.\n\nAnd it absolutely matters where they met\u2026\n\nShe choose to move to the US, no one forced her, she is a grown woman.", "She made the decision to move away from her family well before he entered the picture.\n\nThen decided to marry a man and have kid with him in his home country.\n\nAlso she seeming can\u2019t keep spending herself into debt\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how people will bend over backwards to remove autonomy from a woman on AITA", "Maybe it's because I'm not American that I don't understand but why would you use PTO for that stuff? Can't you just take an unpaid day when you need it? EDIT: America is a hell world. Thanks folks!", "Yeah, if you\u2019ve given her money to pay it off and yet the debt is back that\u2019s not from before you met, that means the debt is from her *current* spending and you guys should really sit down and look at all your expenses together. Find out where this money is going because it sounds like your wife has a spending problem.", "No no \u2014 his and the guy you responded to. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine approaching a lifelong commitment with the person I\u2019ve decided to share my life with like that. And I\u2019ve been married for 10 years.", "Makes sense why that persons partner is now an ex eh? Lol", "So you are trying to say that their child shouldn't build a relationship with her family. Noted. 2-3 weeks yearly isn't that much. It's certainly not comparable to the time she's probably spending with his family.", "Neither is the husband.....", "Not if you need the money...", "The thing about that is 61-69% (depending on who you ask) of Americans are living pay check to pay check and they can be fired for absolutely no reason in most states. No, they really can't afford to take unpaid leave.", "A lot of places won\u2019t let you take unpaid days if you have PTO. Even if you don\u2019t have PTO it\u2019s really frowned upon in most places unless it\u2019s a true emergency.", "Most people in the US live paycheck to paycheck, why would someone willingly risk their financial situation and not get paid the amount they need to be paid to make ends meet?", "I am American and my company does not offer unpaid sick days. All absences planned and unplanned are taken out of PTO. I accrue 5hrs every pay period (2 weeks) IF I do not miss any days or have any tardies. At the end of the year, we can carry over up to 40hrs PTO, they are not cashed out of unused. I have had an unexpected health crisis and am currently -15 hours PTO. We can go up to -40hrs PTO at management\u2019s discretion. So if I quit or get fired, I will have 15hrs of work taken out of my last paycheck.", "Most people can't afford that financial hit", "Taking unpaid days hits harder when you go on vacation too", "My bad and I agree", "Because she can't afford her expenses when she's paying you $400 a month. Jesus dude how are you not seeing how you are contributing to her debt. YTA", "Where did you get that? What I'm saying is that with their finances, she is clearly living beyond her means. Would I like to spend more time with my family? Would I like MY  daughter to spend more time with her family in England? The answer is yes. But it's simply not feasible while still remaining fiscally responsible. 2-3 weeks internationally is actually a lot for an American. It sounds like she's neglecting the family she actually created and CHOSE to have. From what OP is saying, she's made her extended family a priority over the relationship with her husband and son.", "Are you delusional? Or just bitter because you moved to your husband's country and he didn't provide for you to see your family in your country whenever you wanted? Of course the husband is compromising. According to American law, he could very easily deny her the ability to take their minor child across state lines without his permission, let alone internationally. And regardless of how much time the child spends with the husband's family, it's not a damn contest. The wife knew that living in a foreign country (which apparently she CHOSE to do prior to meeting her husband) would mean seeing her family less. This doesn't even begin to address the fact that her spending habits have clearly left her in debt. Flat out - she cannot afford to keep travelling the way she is. It sucks but that's life. \n\nAnswer this - if the husband decided to take a cross country road trip with his relatives in a caravan and took their son, should the wife pay for any of that?"]}
