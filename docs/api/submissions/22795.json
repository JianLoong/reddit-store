{"id": 22795, "submission_id": "155l6qz", "title": "AITA for leaving all my groceries at the register when the cashier refused to sell me alcohol?", "selftext": "\"Abundance\" and \"Bounty\" are two supermarket chains, both with stores \\~20 minutes away from me, and \\~15 apart from each other.  I (33m) usually go to Abundance unless I want something I can only get at Bounty, and I haven't been asked for ID when buying alcohol in over 8 years at either store (or anywhere else for that matter).\n\nI went to Abundance yesterday to buy my weekly groceries, and picked up a six pack of beer to enjoy on the weekend.  I set the beers down in front of my other groceries on the conveyor belt, then moved to the other side to start packing.\n\nThe cashier saw the beer and asked me for ID.  I told him I didn't have my ID on me, and he told me he couldn't sell me the beer and placed it to one side.  I politely said \"Okay, no problem, have a nice day\", then walked away, leaving all my groceries on the conveyor belt (I didn't take anything).\n\nAs I walked away, he shouted \"Excuse me, sir?\", but I saw no reason to waste time on continuing a discussion because he already made his decision, and I understand how strict they need to be when it comes to alcohol and ID (my mother worked in a liquor store for several years).\n\nTo be very clear:  I did not do this to \"get back at him\", but rather because it meant I needed to go to Bounty to get the beer, and it didn't make sense to drag all my heavy groceries from Abundance to Bounty when I could just get the same groceries from Bounty, including the beer (I also figured carrying bags of groceries from Abundance around Bounty wasn't wise because it might raise suspicions of shoplifting).\n\nSo I went from Abundance to Bounty, bought everything I needed from Bounty - including the beer - then went home.\n\nWhen I got back, my girlfriend asked why I took so long, and after explaining it, she said I was an asshole for making things difficult for the staff at Abundance, because they would need to restock all my stuff and possibly throw things away.  I don't know if that last part is true, but she knows someone who works in a similar store and explained that they're pretty strict on how long certain products are allowed to be outside the freezers/refrigerators.  She also said it was extremely rude that I just walked away when the cashier was trying to talk to me.\n\nI asked what she would've done, but she didn't have an answer besides just coming home without the beer, but I don't see that as a solution.  ATIA?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nSince everyone keeps asking why I didn't bring ID:  The only ID I own is my passport and I don't want to risk it getting lost or stolen.  I also didn't think it was necessary considering I hadn't been asked for ID in over 8 years.", "created_utc": 1689938591, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155l6qz/aita_for_leaving_all_my_groceries_at_the_register/", "score": 8360, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course you left it there to inconvenience them, otherwise you would have looked back when they called you, you were just rude.  Youre 33, grow up.", "YTA   don't be such a jerk.  Of course you left your groceries  there to get back at him because you went to the other store and had to shop all over again.   When you could have zipped into the 2nd store for beer.\n\nAsshole", "YTA\n\nYou expected the cashier to commit a crime, selling alcohol without checking ID, and then you pitched a hissy fit when they refused.\n\nTake your ID to buy alcohol and don\u2019t be shitty to underpaid hourly workers.", "YTA. I\u2019m not buying that you didn\u2019t leave your stuff there to inconvenience them for not selling you alcohol without an ID. (I will edit to add that if you didn\u2019t drive then I understand not wanting to carry all of that to and around the next store I guess. But you could have put it back yourself.) But still YTA. You just kept walking when they tried to talk to you. You were clearly being rude about it. Regardless if they have never asked before, they have every right to require ID to sell alcohol. They did nothing wrong to you.", "\"The cashier did his job, so i left my groceries for him to clean up after me\" \n\nYTA and you know it.\n\nHow is it HIS fault, that you didn't have any ID to prove your age? You for sure know, that you can't buy alcohol as a minor. AND you for sure know, that this poor guy had to take all those groceries back to where they belong to.\n\nAll of this because your lazy ass couldn't bring an ID OR buy the groceries and buy the alcohol at the other store OR put the groceries back and THEN go buy them at the other place.", "YTA. You say that you didn\u2019t leave everything there and ignore him to be petty, but I\u2019m sure the cashier didn\u2019t see it that way", "YTA.   \nYou left the cashier hanging man\u2026 that\u2019s RUDE. Just because you were miffed (you say it wasn\u2019t revenge, but why be harsh if it\u2019s not?!) you left them with a belt full of groceries.   \n\n\nWho was going to clean up your mess? A grocery fairy?", "YTA. They are required by law to check ID if they have any doubt about your age. Law enforcement agencies conduct stings, and the store and the employee get in big trouble if they fail. If you want to buy alcohol, bring your ID. If you forget it, accept that as your mistake and don't act like you are entitled to buy. You should have bought those groceries and figured another way to get your beer instead of dumping your problem on the store.", "YTA. Stores normally have rules about checking IDs because of laws about alcohol sales and managers will fire people if they don't do it. Just because you have gotten people who don't care if they end up fired for the past 8 years doesn't somehow mean this cashier is being unreasonable or something. And just walking away and leaving your groceries there is really childish. There are regulations about not being able to put stuff back into refrigeration because they have no way to know how long it has been out. So they probably had to throw stuff away and it was probably really obnoxious to have to put all of your stuff away.\nYou could have gone home with your groceries and gone back out to get the beer later with an ID. I don't know why that isn't an option for you. \nYour girlfriend is right that you're the AH.", "YTA for being rude to the cashier when they were just doing their job. They were in no way rude to you.", "YTA. They have a legal right to ask for ID and refuse a sale if ID is not presented.  In some cases its actually a legal obligation regardless of age.  Go to the freaking DMV and get yourself an ID card.\n\nEdit for clarity.  It is always a legal obligation to ensure a person buying alcohol is of legal age.  The must look over a certain age requirement to ask for ID varies by state and/or establishment policy.", "YTA\u2026what the what?   Well, bless your heart.  Just a wee bit entitled, aren\u2019t we?   It was not the clerks fault that they were doing their job and probably following the law by asking for ID.  Which you should have on you at all times anyway.  You had to carry cash or a card to pay for your groceries, knew you were getting beer, why not take your ID?   Clearly you just wanted to act all big and mighty and decided to take your frustrations out on someone who does not get paid near enough to deal with assholes like you.  Do better man.", "YTA. You should have checked first. ID laws are nothing new, and it's very tacky and low brow of you to do what you did.", "YTA. You know you have to show ID to buy beer. You just wanted to be a diva because you didn't get what you wanted (which could cause someone to lose their job).", "YTA. They\u2019re doing their job. Grow the hell up", "YTA, you were tryna do way too much bro. The cashier is doing their job. Take your fucking groceries and leave. It's not the end of the world that you can't buy alcohol. Suck it up. With your goofy ass acting like a child, they shouldn't sell you alcohol regardless.", "YTA for 2 reasons.\n\nOther people already mentioned your atrocious manners in the store, so I won't address that any further. \n\nThe other one is that you live in the Netherlands, where carrying some form of ID (either a passport from any country or ID card from a EU country) on your person in mandated by law. No one will stop you on the street to check if you're actually doing it, but you're still breaking the law. And if you're ever in a scenario where you'll need to prove your identity to law enforcement and you fail to present a valid document you will be fined.\n\nYou literally had no excuse to not be able to ID yourself in the store because *by law* you should've been able to, and then when you didn't get your way you acted like a total asshole.", "YTA and I will explain why: you left in the middle of a conversation and ignored the employee completely when he called you. I understand why you wouldn't want to buy the groceries at the store anymore, but the least you could do is let the employee know about this instead of just walking away. For all he knew you might go to your car to get your license or something. \n\nAll it needed for a N T A would be to politely tell the employee that in that case you wouldn't buy the groceries and you're sorry about it. After all, you're the one walking around without an ID on you, so it's your fault.", "YTA for just ignoring someone trying to talk to you and inconveniencing workers just because you couldn\u2019t buy beer.\n\nYou say you \u201cunderstand why they can\u2019t\u201d but you can\u2019t understand how you were just straight up an AH to the worker(s)?", "yta. you knew you didn't have your id, but youj tried to buy beer anyway, and when it didnt work out you made it ither peoples problem", "YTA. How can you not see that you are the asshole. That poor cashier is just doing their job. You were an entitled jerk that threw a petulant child fit because somebody dared to do something perfectly normal. Giving them extra work. Annoying everybody else in the process. \n\nI wish the manager there would just get you banned from the store.", "YTA. I\u2019m in my 50s and still get carded. Not because I look younger than 21, but because the poor cashier is trying to follow whatever stupid rule their manager says they must, to keep their job. Leaving all your groceries is rude and childish. I still want to see your ID.", "YTA! Get a regular ID. I am almost 47 and still get carded at times. I always take it as a compliment.  Around here every X amount of months or so they do a sting. Send inspectors to places to purchase alcohol. Yes, some are underage. If these establishments don't ask for proof of age. Their ass is in the sling. It also gets published in our local newspaper who failed.", "YTA.  You're not telling the truth here.  You wanted someone to be miserable because you were having a temper tantrum.  Proof?  You re-shopped for all your groceries.  You  ate up your time, the cashier's time and all the customers behind you.  I personally wouldn't show my face in that store again.", "YTA. Cashier already makes hardly a sustainable wage and deals with nonsense all day. Then you roll in. Some businesses require ID checks for all. Even if you look 80.", "YTA. Especially if you live somewhere where the relevant age for buying beer is 18 or younger, I can understand why you wouldn't have your ID with you. I can also understand why you would then not want to buy all those other groceries, upon being unexpectedly carded. It is even, yes, the shop employees' responsibility to put away groceries that a customer has decided not to buy. \n\nHowever, you became an absolute asshole when, rather than simply saying to the cashier, \"I'm sorry, I don't have ID on me, and if I can't make all of these purchases then I don't want any of them,\" you just *walked away* and ignored him when he called after you. That was a move so childish I have to wonder whether you actually are a teenager, and not \"33\" as you claim to be.", "YTA obviously. The cashier was just doing their job and you left all your shit there to be petty. Grow up.", "YTA\n\nAs one who has worked food/liquor retail in 1 capacity or another for close to 40 years, every single thing about your post makes you TA. As a child of a mom who worked in liquor stores you should know more than most you need to ALWAYS have your ID on you for purchasing alcohol. No matter your age. Excise police once arrested an 82 year old man sitting at the bar I was bartending that night. Why? He didn't have his ID on him. Point is, you have to provide ID upon request in every single U.S. state, no matter if it's been a week, a month, a year or decades since you have been asked for it. In fact, I don't know how the scanners haven't automatically prompted for your ID info to begin with. That's only been part of every grocery store register system for 20 years now. (As far as chains go. Mom & pops stores may still have old fashioned ones.) \n\nYou claim you only have a passport that you don't want to lose, yet you need another form of valid ID to obtain and maintain a passport. That excuse doesn't fly.\n\nAnd your gf was very correct in that many grocery stores have a time limit for how long cold/frozen items can be out from the respective holding units. So yes, you probably did make the store throw away food that would have been good for sale were it not for your actions.\n\nCan't even convey how much of an AH you were to blatantly ignore the cashier/attendant that was JUST TRYING TO DO THEIR JOB! Guarantee you were the talk of all employees the rest of the day, and not in a good way. I would be too embarrassed of my behavior to even go back into the store ever again if I were you, because trust me, the employees will remember and will point you out to new employees for being the the biggest walking puckered AH on the planet. \n\nDo better, \"Kevin\".", "YTA - Who leaves anywhere without ID? \u201cI only have a passport\u201d like they don\u2019t make IDs that are for just identification purposes. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my passport\u201d so get a passport card instead. \n\nI think you have operated off the guise people will give you passes for knowing you and it failed.", "YTA\n\nAnyone who says otherwise hasn\u2019t worked retail I assume.

Not for not having your ID, and not even necessarily for choosing to not proceed with the rest of the transaction(although that is a bit rediculous as well.

But YTA for not just talking to the cashier and asking if it would be OK to leave your groceries can could they put them up?", "YTA. By law they need to ask for your ID. You not owning a more convenient form of ID is not their problem", "YTA- You could have bought the groceries and then just stopped for beer somewhere else.\n\nSomeone had to put those away for you.\n\nYou say you don't have a DL.  You can still get an ID that's not a drivers license that has only your date of birth and other personal information.\n\nYou state you know how strict the laws are, yet you still continue to try and purchase alcohol without an ID.", "YTA. It's a law to ask for id. It's your responsibility to carry it if you want alcohol. Doesn't matter if you haven't been carded in years. Fuck your passport excuse.", "YTA.\n\nDude, you literally dumped your shit on the belt and walked out while the cashier was trying to speak to you. You\u2019re either lying and *did* do it out of spite because he (reasonably) asked for an ID , or you have no social awareness. Either way, your gf is right; you were extremely rude.\n\nYou could\u2019ve at least explained to the cashier that you were going to leave because you wanted to get all your stuff at once. Bonus points if you\u2019d put your groceries back where you found them, even if it was just the non-refrigerated stuff.\n\nID is always necessary because they are able to ask you at any time.

You could have purchased the rest of your products and gotten just the beer from Bounty.", "YTA. How fucking rude. The kid is doing their job!

If you don't have an ID (YOUR FAULT) and you're asked for it, they can't sell it to you. You totally punished the worker for a policy out of his hands. It wouldn't have harmed you one bit to put the beer aside and make a second trip.", "YTA, everything your wife said is correct. \n\nYes, you should have come home without the beer because you didn't have ID which is legally required to get it. The fact that you weren't asked for ID before doesn't magically make the law disappear. \n\nIn your mind, getting beer was so important that you didn't mind causing problem to the store employees and being a boor to them. That's asshole behaviour.", "YTA. Why were you so insistent on buying beer but didn\u2019t even have an ID on you? You should be getting ID checked every time you make a purchase, and if you are in your 30s you definitely could look younger and could confuse a new cashier who doesn\u2019t know you.

Sometimes that cashier will get in trouble for not checking ID, and the laws punishes the seller.  Get a simple ID if your country provides for it.  I live where I can get just an ID, not a driver's license at minimum cost.", "YTA. The employee was following the law, and you basically expected them to risk losing their jobs. It's gross and nothing to be proud of being a fully grown adult throwing a tantrum. Sort yourself out.", "You. Are. The. Asshole. \n\nPut your own fucking groceries up.", "You wasted your own time shopping TWICE. It still would have been faster for you to check out your groceries and then purchase beer at the next place. You acted like a big baby being told no. This was a situation you caused and you are TA for sure.", "YTA. \n\nIt's your fault that you didn't bring your ID. It's basic common sense that clerks CAN ask for your ID when it comes to buying alcohol. So I don't understand why you're sitting with a surprised pikachu face. It doesn't matter if you haven't been asked for ID in a long time. You still take it. \n\nLeaving your groceries like that was just childish and embarrassing on your part.

Not only that, but you are entitled and threw a tantrum.", "YTA. \n\nYou wanted alcohol.

You suck.", "YTA and an entitled one at that. Do you realize that the cashier can lose their job if they sell alcohol to someone underage? They get secret shopped by ABC agents regularly and get fired and fined if they sell alcohol to an underage person. They are required to card anyone who appears under 30 (may be even older now). You should be flattered that they thought you looked younger. Furthermore, yes, you made their job harder\u2014and held up other customers\u2014by leaving your stuff there. Especially after all customer service workers gone through during the pandemic, you ought to be more sympathetic.", "YTA. Your temper tantrum is ridiculous. There are many other forms of ID that aren\u2019t a passport, I got a provisional driving licence for exactly this reason.", "WTH, man? YTA.\n\nJust because they haven't asked, doesn't mean you shouldn't carry it. \n\nI'm 50 and I still get carded. Because IT IS THE LAW and I am fine with that.", "YTA.

You did not have ID and made a scene to be petty", "Yta. That poor cashier was doing their fucking job, which you made harder by throwing a tantrum and leaving all your shit at the register.

Hell, I used to have to ID my own parents back when I worked as one and Dad bought cigarettes. And this was when I was over 21 myself.", "YTA, how is this even a question?", "I was on the fence but hearing you're from the Netherlands, which has ID laws that require you to have valid ID at all times and alcohol must be IDd means that you've just been lucky.

You could have asked them hold your groceries and you'd be back. Buy your beer at the next store (which also could have denied you) and come back for your stuff.

Sometimes they don't, but if the cameras are on or they are being inspected, they will 100% follow requirement protocol. You always should have your ID with you to purchase alcohol. Doesn't matter if you are 23 or 67, you can and will eventually be carded because they are required to do so.\n\nYTA, the whole situation is your fault and you did act like an ass here.
