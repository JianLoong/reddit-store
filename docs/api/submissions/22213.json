She is now 8 years old.\n\nSide note. The house our family lives in is his (purchased before me) and he is currently unemployed because he lost his job in June and hasn't received government assitance yet. his credit cards are maxed out right now and is living off his savings (my salary covers family expenses but nothing else).\n\nIn the past year we have spent a total of 8k of our emergency savings on emergency vet bills for her. 1. he gave her a bone full of fat (which I told him not to give to her) and she was hospitalized for pancreatitis). 2. She had a mammary tumor that was thankfully benign so surgery to remove the mass (he still wouldn't spay her). 3. she had a phantom pregnancy a few months ago so another trip to vet for tests where I finally convinced him to spay her. 4. The spaying. 5. Now (3 weeks after spaying) she has a large mass on another tit, it's very bad and leaking red.\n\nSince my husband has no job and no income, his solution to pay for her vet bills, multiple tumor removals, chemotherapy etc. is to sell his car (I have my own that I use everyday for work) and then the house that our children and I live in (he needs my ok to sell as we are married and it is registered as a family residence). He says he refuses to let his dog die over a tumor (he has a very unhealthy attachment ot his dog, she basically replaced his dad after his dad's passing). I have animals of my own and I understand not wanting to let them go and doing everything for them. But I think this is excessive and I think everyone needs a limit where they say I'm not going to put myself in cripling debt and be homeless for this.\n\nHe obviously thinks I am an AH for not being ok with the house and car being sold and thinks I'm even more of an AH because I financially can't and don't want to put myself in huge amounts of debt for the dog (when we are already struggling on 1 income).\n\nSo I ask everyone, AITA?", "created_utc": 1689346015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zie1f/aita_for_telling_my_30f_husband_35m_that_i_dont/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So while you are right that selling the house is extreme there isn't a thing you can do about it.", "Nta your husband needs therapy", "NTA.\n\nI love my dog and I think of her as my child, but if I ever get to a point where she is costing me that much money and I might have to sell my house for pay for her, there's definitely a problem. That is not a normal reaction. Why doesn't he start job searching?", "NTA\n\nYour husband doesn't realise it, but he is slowly sacrificing his family for his dog. It is not anymore \"the family making some sacrifices\", but really \"sacrificing the family\".\n\nAlso, your husband probably needs some mental help.", "NTA. It is ridiculous and incredibly self centered for your husband to sell his car for vet bills let alone your home. That\u2019s insane. Is he even considering the quality of life of the dog? Sounds like the poor thing is suffering and he is misguidedly prolonging it while also putting your family in a financial hole.", "Info: I do understand how much the dog means to him, and how he desperately wants to save her. However, has he talked to the vet about her life expectancy and quality of life? There is a point where it isn\u2019t fair to her to continue.\n\nPet insurance might be an idea for the future but won\u2019t help you now. \n\nYou are NTA for trying to keep your family secure. He is NTA for trying to help someone he loves. However, sometimes there simply aren\u2019t enough resources. \n\nI am sorry that there isn\u2019t a perfect answer. If his new employment is stable and he will be bringing in money dependably, if the vet believes her future prognosis is stable maybe you can get an equity loan with the house for this procedure and not have to go scorched earth and make yourselves homeless by selling it outright. It is a big risk though since your emergency fund has been emptied and leaves your family rather vulnerable. If it can\u2019t be done, then it can\u2019t be done regardless of wanting.", "NTA. \n\nEven if the dog would make it, I doubt he's got more than 2 years of life left in him. Most likely, he's got a few more months. Either way, a house is a huge investment.\n\nI do sympathize with your husband though , he's clearly in significant grief, and not processing this very well. It won't be any better in a few months even if you were to sell the house. \n\nI think the discussion to have is not just the monetary aspect of things, but what is best for the dog? I doubt more surgeries is the answer.", "NTA\n\nYour husband isn't considering the pain it will bring the other members of his family.\n\nHe is in a tough situation, but he will need the car when he gets job eventually. The Husky might not even live very long with all the treatment, it's a risky move to potentially prolong the dogs life. What will you do if their is another financial emergency this year and your drastic options have already been used?", "NTA and please don't let your husband adopt another dog", "NTA", "NTA I love animals. However your children need a home to live in. They do not need to be forced to move to save an animals life. He needs to prioritize your kids before the dog.", "NTA. Unfortunately what he's experiencing is what could happen when you don't spay/neuter your dog. The dog will die, whether he gets the surgeries/chemo or not. Getting them is not a guarantee that the dog will live forever. Hell, she could even die getting those procedures and your husband will have no house, no car and no dog.", "NAH - I LOVE my dogs more than *almost* anything else. But people who can\u2019t afford pets should not have them. Obviously, selling your house is not a solution to paying for vet bills. He needs to surrender that dog to the shelter or rescue where they can pay for her medical care. \n\nThat being said, I understand getting caught up in the heat of the moment and thinking \u201cjust one more bill\u201d and then the hemorrhaging money will be over. \n\nClearly, your husband needs a job and some grief counseling.", "Man my dog is my baby but I wouldn't let the poor baby suffer because of my selfish reasons...your man needs therapy", "that's either a super cheap house or a super expensive vet.", "\"our children\".\n\nNTA.

It is tragic and painful, but you and your children need a roof over your heads. He needs to speak with a therapist about letting the dog go.", "He's currently looking for a job but is having a hard time finding one. It's only been 2 months he is unemployed.", "If he thinks it's reasonable to displace his children and sell the family home to buy a little extra time with an aging dog, his attachment to the dog *is* unhealthy. The needs of his children come before a pet.", "It's a good thing the dog loves him unconditionally because he's done a lot to hurt her", "Honestly it sounds like he doesn\u2019t actually care about the dog\u2019s quality of life. If he did he would have spayed her years ago and not intentionally given her food that could (and did) make her sick. Would he even listen to the vet\u2019s opinion? I\u2019ve had dogs my whole life, unless you\u2019re interested in breeding them, most places won\u2019t let you adopt a dog unless you get them fixed. \n\nHusband needs grief counseling to deal with the death of his father and he needs to come to terms with the fact that he may lose his family over this too.  No car, wants to sell the house, what\u2019s next? \n\nNTA OP, keep a roof over your kids heads!", "Doesn't not spaying increase the risk for mammary tumors etc? The guy could have had a few more healthy years with the dog. Instead his failure to provide her a comparatively cheap low-risk preventative surgery has resulted in her having a miserable end of life.\n\nFix your pets everyone.", "This guy is supporting his kids on maxed out credit cards and you can't identify any assholes in this situation?", "Ask him where will you all live if the house is sold? There's a housing crisis in most countries at the moment.", "1 in 2 unspayed dogs past the third heat cycle get mammary tumors and 50% of those tumors are cancerous.
