Hello, as the title says, my husband adopted a female husky on a whim before we met. He never researched the breed or anything about dogs. He refused to spay her because as he says \"she wouldn't be a real husky and would lose her personality\" which we all know isn't true. She is now 8 years old.\n\nSide note. The house our family lives in is his (purchased before me) and he lost his job in June and employment insurance hasn't come in. My salary covers house expenses but we now have 0$ into eh bank.\n\nIn the past year we have spent a total of 8k of our emergency savings on emergency vet bills for her. 1. he gave her a bone covered in fat and she was hospitalized for pancreatitis. 2. She had a mammary tumor that was thankfully benign so surgery to remove the mass. 3. she had a phantom pregnancy a few months ago so another trip to vet for tests where I finally convinced him to spay her. 4. The spaying. 5. Now (3 weeks after spaying) she has a large mass on another tit, it's very bad and leaking red. Vet says cancer, we are doing more test.\n\nSince we are living paycheck to paycheck, his solution to pay for her vet bills, multiple tumor removals, chemotherapy etc. is to sell his car (I have my own that I use everyday for work) and then the house that our children and I live in (he needs my ok to sell as we are married and it is registered as a family residence). He says he refuses to let his dog die over a tumor (he has a very unhealthy attachment ot his dog, she basically replaced his dad after his dad's passing 8 years ago, he says she's the only thing he had after the passing). I have animals of my own and I understand not wanting to let them go and doing everything for them, which i have done. But I think this is excessive and I think everyone needs a limit where they say I'm not going to put myself in cripling debt and be homeless for this.\n\nHe obviously thinks I am an AH for not being ok with the house and car being sold and thinks I'm even more of an AH because I financially can't and don't want to put myself in huge amounts of debt for the dog (when we are already struggling on 1 income). So I ask everyone, AITA?\n\nNOTE: I will adress a few question. I refer to her as his dog because he made it clear it is his dog and I have no say in the way he raises her or medical decisions. I had mentioned multiple times to spay her and to get insurance, both times he would get mad and say it's none of my business. I care for the dog a lot, ex. she only eats when I feed her for wtv reason, etc. Regarding employment, if he get's a part time job he looses employment benefits so that doesn't make sense as employment benefits bring in more money (they haven't come in yet)", "created_utc": 1689346015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zie1f/aita_for_telling_my_30f_husband_35m_that_i_dont/", "score": 3228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If his new employment is stable and he will be bringing in money dependably, if the vet believes her future prognosis is stable maybe you can get an equity loan with the house for this procedure and not have to go scorched earth and make yourselves homeless by selling it outright.

The life span of an unspayed husky IS 8 years. The reason this dog is sick is your husband's actions. The reason the dog has mammary tumors is because it wasn't spayed. The risk goes from 1% to 26%. Your husband is trying to keep a terminal dog alive that is dying because of choices HE MADE. Now, he wants to ruin the stability of his entire family too? He needs a wake up call now. This behavior is beyond unreasonable.   He needs counseling right away. He can't save this dog, he can only prolong its misery. He won't save his dead father by saving the dog. What he may be doing is desperately trying to buy time. He can't face the idea of grief and would rather destroy everything and everyone around him to avoid personal pain damn the consequences. This is messed up. He will only end up causing more pain.", "NTA. It\u2019s obvious your husband is being unreasonable but I also understand grief makes us unreasonable sometimes.

It\u2019s not a normal thought process to make a family homeless to TRY and save an 8 year old dog from cancer.

Is there a good change of survival?", "NTA \n\nThis is coming from a person who split a 14K vet bill for my 6yo dog with my ex. He's doing very well 4 years later.

Sadly, I put her to sleep, staying with her through the end.\n\nThere comes a time when you just have to realize that all the money in the world isn't going to save your dog, cat, cancer patient, heart patient, etc.\n\nSometimes the kindest thing is to say goodbye and stay by their side as they go to sleep.\n\nYour husband obviously has some psychological issues going on.

How are you supposed to get approved for another rental or mortgage when he has no income and maxed out credit cards? How can he find another job if he\u2019s sold his means of transportation? \n\nThat is not rational thinking, and no sane individual should see it as being even remotely ok.

I am sorry your dog is not well, but adults need to face harsh realities, and the reality is you do not have unlimited resources to prolong this dog\u2019s life indefinitely.  You are well beyond the resources you already do have available, and it is not okay to sell the house or even the car for further treatment.  If you cannot afford another surgery (and you can\u2019t), your options are to euthanize now or to manage palliatively (if the vet thinks that\u2019s a humane option).  It sucks, but money isn\u2019t infinite and there comes a point where even infinite money for more treatments is actually not the problem because the dog doesn\u2019t understand she is hurting now to maybe hopefully feel better later, she is just hurting.  \n\nMy fairly young cat had mammary tumors.  Because she was young AND I was luckily enough to have the funds, I made the decision to try surgery and chemo.  If she was old or I simply didn\u2019t have the money, I would have made a different decision.  \n\nYour husband is in no way a responsible pet owner based on these actions, and (even worse) he is not a responsible adult/father/husband.

Where I live, euthanasia usually starts at 100\u20ac and can cost up to 600\u20ac in some cases, so it's not cheap and they can't do things for free unless maybe volunteer basis, but the volunteer vets don't really euthanasie here.", "[removed]", "NTA I love animals.", "He saw me put down my 14year old cat in April becuse he had cancer that no one knew about and he was in horrible shape, He left the room while I stayed the entire time.

Our vet is located in a more rural area of our county and she is very realistic with the incomes of her patients' owners. She will not make anyone feel guilty for choosing euth if they do not have the funds to pay for  surgeries or chemo or any type of long term care. She's taken care of us for a long time and I hope she never retires.", "It happens that way, sometimes. I got a rescue dog, and took her to a different vet than my first ones, for a check up. They scared the hell out of me telling me that she had a heart murmur, and they'd have to run a shitload of tests that would add up to a few thousand dollars. When I said I needed to wait, they acted so judgmental, like I wanted to kill her.\n\nI took her to my OG vet for a second opinion, and he laughed and said, it's common in smaller dogs, and we'll just keep an eye on it, and gave me a list of symptoms to watch out for. 10 years later, she's still trucking along, and not once did her heart give her any major issues.", "During my veterinary internship there was one internal medicine specialist who, in an entire year of dealing with critically ill patients, only ever recommended euthanasia ONCE. A cat who had gone septic from severe intestinal disease and repeated enemas. Until that moment I kind of wondered whether she even believed in euthanasia as a moral choice (it definitely is). It was so hard to convince that cat's owner not to \"do whatever it takes to save her.\"", "I frequently tell owners that I\u2019d rather put an animal to sleep a week too early than a day to late. I\u2019ve had a lot of owners say they wish they\u2019d done it earlier; nobody (except in the immediate throes of grief) wishes they\u2019d waited.", "I need to stop reading these because I'm just holding my 17 year old cat and sobbing.  That sounds like a great last day.", "That's so sad. But you did the best thing for your baby.", "Thank you! My son, who was about 7 at the time, named her Puff Puff. She was a great dog.", "Something else someone told me is that pets don\u2019t live as long as you do because there are more of them that need homes than there are homes, so they give you a chance to save others", "My husband and I have said that after these cats go we will just do fostering and not have our own but I doubt we'd ever be able to stick to that"]}
