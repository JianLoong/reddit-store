I am sorry your dog is not well, but adults need to face harsh realities, and the reality is you do not have unlimited resources to prolong this dog\u2019s life indefinitely.  You are well beyond the resources you already do have available, and it is not okay to sell the house or even the car for further treatment.  If you cannot afford another surgery (and you can\u2019t), your options are to euthanize now or to manage palliatively (if the vet thinks that\u2019s a humane option).  It sucks, but money isn\u2019t infinite and there comes a point where even infinite money for more treatments is actually not the problem because the dog doesn\u2019t understand she is hurting now to maybe hopefully feel better later, she is just hurting.  \n\nMy fairly young cat had mammary tumors.  Because she was young AND I was luckily enough to have the funds, I made the decision to try surgery and chemo.

That was $1100 out of pocket after we were reimbursed from insurance.\n\nI'm always looking to keep him happy and healthy in his now senior years and I rely on my (quite practical and reasonable) vet to let us know what the prognosis will be. Recently we found some arthritis in his hip, but it's being remedied with glucosamine and when the time comes anti-inflammatory meds. Would we do another joint surgery on him? No. We understand this will probably be the thing that eventually will get him, but he's an aging animal. \n\nI can't imagine putting my poor old guy through something like chemo.

We always want to give our loved ones as much time as possible in this world, but what is the quality of life like? Is she in pain? Can she still get around?

So the result will be the same, but in a even more stressful way. He has no funds at all, so he can't even pay for putting the dog down. Usually I'd generally agree, but he has no funds and it is not uncommon for vets to seize the dog instead.\n\nEdit: Maybe to clarify why I did not immediately suggest euthanasia, where I live, it's not cheap and can easily go up to 600\u20ac and vets cannot forfeit the cost afaik by law.", "A huskies life-span is 12-15 years... If he can't afford anything for the dog right now, he can't pay for her to be euthanized either and not all vets will go down with the price, it is more likely they will seize the animal and then continue treating them and the result will be the same of the dog being rehomed.\n\nThe dog is in pain and they can't afford treating the dog, euthanasia isn't free either. So, the solution is to let the dog continue suffer in pain until it passes if the vet(s) refuse to do it for free?\n\nEdit: To make it more clear, it is not unlikely that he can't afford the euthanasia and the vet has the ability to the seize the dog. The husband has nothing to his name anymore, so he won't be able to pay for it unless he asks his wife to do it and I doubt he will entertain that thought slightly. Where I live, euthanasia can cost up to 600\u20ac and afaik, vets, unless volunteer basis, cannot do things for free here.\n\nEdit\u00b2: Removed something, but the point still stands that in some parts of the world, vets can't by law drop prices extermely low, as there are minimum prices set in stone by the law.

My dog is my baby and I would spend any feasible amount of money to save/protect her, but not if it were just going to prolong suffering.", "Ooof if the maximum life expectancy even with all the surgeries is only 2 years I think its time for her to move on. I am with you I have owned multiple dogs in the past. And one of the cruelest things I think you can do to a dog is force it to live when it is in pain (and there is not much time left for the dog, I am not talking about putting a dog down because it has a bum leg lol). Because the dog does not know why its in pain it has no concept of the situation it is in, it just knows it hurts. Which like the pain of losing a dog sucks but the pain of seeing a dog live past its expected life time is worse. I have had friends who have done similar things and it is heart breaking seeing a dog who cannot move around and winces every time you touch it because it is in that much pain.", "I think it\u2019d be good to find some accounts of what absolute hell chemo is for humans and show those to him, remind him that these are people with choices who understand what\u2019s going on, but the dog will not.

I can see my roommate and i doing it in circumstances though, but not, as you said, to prolong their lives just a few months with poor quality of life.\n\nRoomie and I have chosen these dogs over kids though, so there's probably some projection going on in this hypothetical. \n\nEither way, it's hard to see clearly when we (people) attribute human thoughts and feelings onto our pets, and that attribution drives a lot of these end of life or emergency decisions. \"Oh, we have to try everything, our dog Lassie trusts us and depends on us, just look into her eyes, you can see how she needs us to make her all better.\"\n\nAnd even having said that, I will 100% be thinking that when the horrific happens to my dogs.", "Lol. Don't worry neither do I.", "Sadly vets see the pound signs and just want to keep charging you for this, that and the other. \n\nThe thing to always remember is: If the animal could talk, would it ask you to help it die? If you think the answer is yes, you know what you should do.", "Euthanasia isn't free, but there might be some emergency fund at a local vet to defray or completely cover the cost.\n\nI looked into home euthanasia for my cat, who is sick. It's a few hundred for that. I don't know what it'd be like for taking a dog to the vet, but I'm guessing it's significantly less money than what this guy wants to do to try to keep the dog alive.", "Many have said in the comments that the dog being unspayed often significantly shortens their lifespan and that 8 years is normal life expectancy in those cases. 12-15 is a healthy husky\u2019s lifespan, but she is not healthy", "Yeah, huskies are now getting added to the banned breed list on rentals since so many people seem to be getting them and not training or caring for them. They can be destructive as heck.", "maybe, but he's been overspending for years\n\nCompetent adults with families are not less than 2 months away from maxed cards and drained emergency savings.", "It\u2019s likely less that he wants her to suffer and more that he prioritizes his feelings over the actual reality that the dog has.

Care Credit is another common program, but it is a line of credit with deferred interest.\n\nAnd I have seen it a lot too, particularly when a pet is the last living connection to a human loved one that's passed. When the pet goes, it's like losing your loved one all over again. It gets very messy emotionally, navigating the multiple layers of grief and facing old wounds you had tried to forget about. It was a fine line for me ethically, how much is for the pet's quality of life, are we just prolonging suffering, and when does it become taking advantage of a client's grief for financial gain?", "They could look into it, if there is anything. It's not available everywhere though. \n\nIt is an option also to contact a shelter to take the dog for just getting it euthanised essentially. That's the route some have gone when they couldn't afford the costs, which also means the same issue would arise with the dog having to be given up and be somewhere else.", "Yea, there are certain diseases that can develop, such as for female dogs and inflammation that's essentially just puss in their abdomen. This happened to am owner I know, before I knew her and her dog. Was unspayed and everything was fill of pus, the dog made it at least.\n\nI mainly didn't suggest euthanasia, as he probably can't pay for it either and it's not cheap. Depending on where they live, vets can't do it for free or can't lower prices too much. Not ever vet does instalments either, so in a few cases, people had to give up their dog a shelter either way to get it euthanised, as they couldn't pay for the euthanasia.", "Yeah, dogs in general are hard enough to find a rental.\n\nAdding the breed and I'm suspecting the dog might not be cared for properly", "They DID spend 8k on vet bills.
