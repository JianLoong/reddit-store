In the divorce, he told me to keep the diamond ring. He said it had been bought with the intention of it being mine, and it had been put to good use because we had many good years together. \n\nWe both moved on, and I have been dating Mark (36) for 2 years now. We have talked about moving in together, and getting married. We\u2019re at the step where we talk about our finances, and I talked about all my assets and debts, including my old engagement ring which is a designer brand worth a significant amount. Mark said now that I am moving on with my life, I should sell the ring and put the money to our future, possibly to contribute towards a down payment for a home together. I disagreed on selling it. There is language in our divorce agreement that gave me full ownership of the ring, but it was a gift to me so it feels wrong to financially profit off of it. Plus it was paid for by my ex, so it also feels wrong to put the money towards something with a new partner. \n\nI said if the idea of me having the ring made Mark uncomfortable, I will give the ring back to my ex husband for him go sell, or I could turn it into another piece of jewelry like earrings or a necklace. Mark is upset I could have a significant amount of money for a down payment that I am refusing to use. \n\nIn full honesty, I have very little savings and deferred student loans because I went to medical school. I was a resident and fellow for 6 years, and made a very low salary while in training. This upcoming July I will have officially finished my fellowship so my new salary will be significantly higher. I have no problems paying off my own loans. It\u2019s just that I have no significant savings to put towards either a wedding or a home with Mark and selling the ring could give me a large sum of cash I refuse to on principle. \n\nI told Mark I am happy and willing to pay him rent if he wanted to buy a place and I move in with him, or we could wait until I had more savings from my new salary. He said it was showing that I didn\u2019t care about us if I could be putting a significant amount towards our future together and choose not to in order to hold onto a ring that should have no meaning to me.

And I may get downvoted for this but I don\u2019t care. Here\u2019s why: You are willing to get rid of the ring and just give it back to your ex, which shows you aren\u2019t holding onto the past relationship. It\u2019s not about the money for you. But it\u2019s about the monetary value of the ring for Mark. But you just don\u2019t want to disrespect your ex by using HIS money to finance a home for your new boyfriend, which is respectable.", "NTA and Mark is acting entitled to your possessions and your money. It may or may not have to do with trying to erase your past with another man, but the part going forward that would worry me is him trying to push you into selling your property to benefit him. \n\nI mean, notice that he didn't recommend that you sell the ring to pay off your student loans that won't be deferred much longer. That doesn't benefit him. He sounds like someone who would take advantage of you.", "NTA. It's your ring and he sounds a lil bit insecure.", "NTA \n\nHe should respect the emotional and historical value you place on it and not just see dollar signs. Feel comfortable in making your own decisions and don't be pressurized into making decisions you will regret,", "First, the ring is yours and you should do whatever you want with it, but don\u2019t give it back to your ex. It\u2019s yours and even though he purchased it, I am sure you paid for it in myriad ways while being married. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re talking about finances. If you cannot agree on how to proceed, at least you will both know how the other person feels. It may be a dealbreaker, but better to know before you marry each other. \n\nThird, your BF doesn\u2019t get to decide what\u2019s important to you and how you feel about the ring or anything else.\n\n\nNTA there may come a time when you\u2019re ready to sell it, but obviously that time is not now.", "I say NTA", "NTA and how dare he demand you sell anything? That sounds less about finances, and more about his insecurities.", "NTA. \n\nIt was a gift, nobody may force you to sell that ring.", "NTA.\n\nMost couples rent a home together before buying one. A mortgage is a huge commitment and affects both credit ratings, so renting is a trial to see if you are compatible living together before taking on debt together.", "NTA. The ring likely isn't worth at much as mark thinks it is. I'd get it appraised (even if it was in the beginning, it might have damage/wear that might affect the value) and check what comparable rings from the same designer are currently reselling for. Even if it's just to shut him up about it already.\n\nIt's really none of his business though.", "NTA\n\nIf you haven't gotten it insured DO SO NOW.\n\nIt might 'disappear', because of a 'misunderstanding' and a substantial payment on your future home has been made BY YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND, not YOU. \n\nWear it always, on a chain, or keep it locked away in a box only you have access to.\n\nBeing that he only sees it as a financial asset, I would keep it as a safeguard things go horribly wrong, and you need fast funds in the event of an emergency.", "NTA\n\nBut it DOES have meaning to you. \n\nOne of the most valuable experiences of my life was the breakup I went through with my ex who I was with for 10 years. Untangling that knot was a slow, deliberate, difficult process. I learned more about myself and about relationships from that breakup than I did from the relationship itself. I grew a lot as a person, my ex and I put a lot of work and mutual respect into the process and while we've since moved on in our lives, he's still a very important part of my history and I have a great deal of appreciation for that. If I had such a significant token from that relationship, I would hang on to it until I felt like I needed to pass it on, and who knows, maybe that will never happen and that's ok. It represents your growth and evolution as a person.  \n\nAside from the simple fact that the ring is yours and you can do what you want with it, we build upon past experiences and relationships that bring us to the present. You don't have to drop and extinguish your past in order to enter a new phase of your life, it doesn't work like that.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think you should be forced into selling anything you own, regardless of where it came from. It also sounds like you\u2019ll be in a decent position to save for a down payment in the coming years with your job so it\u2019s not even like it\u2019s your only realistic option to sell it. Maybe bf is just nervous it means you\u2019re still hung up on your ex?", "you are not. sounds like mark has an issue with money and not of his own either.\n\nbe careful with him, small red flag from a 55 year old married man who just had his 34th anniversary with his wife!\n\ngood luck!", "NTA  \nIt's an easy one: it's yours, bottom line.  It's okay for him to ask since you were reviewing assets, but the minute you communicated that you were not comfortable selling it, it should have been immediately dropped.  He was wrong to press the issue.  \nSharing a future doesn't mean that you no longer get to have boundaries.  Being an individual and being in a relationship exist at the same time.  This is a part of your past that you do not share with him or put towards your shared future at this time.  You are allowed that, and he should respect your decision.", "NTA\n\nThe ring is yours. If you want to keep it because it's a beautiful ring, keep it. If you want to sell it and use the cash to take a cruise, do that. \n\nThe ring is not Mark's and he doesn't get to decide or tell you what to do with your property.  \n\nMark sounds incredibly insecure that a tiny piece of jewelry is enough to make him shake in his boots. \n\n>He said it was showing that I didn\u2019t care about us if I could be putting a significant amount towards our future together and choose not to in order to hold onto a ring that should have no meaning to me.  \n\n\nIt does not show that you \"don't care about\" your future together if you decide not to sell your ring. \n\nYou're 32, which is still very young. You can start saving once you finish that fellowship and you're making more money. \n\nMark sounds like a crappy human being.", "NTA. It represents an important chapter in your life and you want to keep it. Mark should respect that. You will be earning money starting in July and can pay off your loans. \n\nKeep talking this through and make sure your financially compatible before you make more of an commitment. Mark doesn\u2019t sound very respectful, generous, or supportive.", "NTA - I couldn't imagine a more reasonable response you could have given to Mark. I'd probably be uncomfortable about you keeping the ring if it was somewhere you see it everyday. If it was in a keepsake box with a few of your old wedding photos that lives under the bed gathering dust then that's ok. I can fully understand that you'll have memories that you may want to share with your children.\n\nI tell you though, if I was bothered about you keeping it - the money is the last thing I'd be concerned about..", "NTA. Tell his entitled insecure self that it\u2019s your ring and that you don\u2019t have to sell it. You obviously have a plan for your life and finances and he shouldn\u2019t be demanding anything financial from you. If you need to wait until you take on a bigger salary, then do so. He can wait. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb", "NTA- If he wants to control this small speck of your past, what will he control next? Have you experienced this pattern?  CONGRTS on your career achievement!!\n\nShould you decide to sell it in the future I hope it fetches what you expect. Jewelry stores are full of engagement rings priced at a mere fraction of what the owner had hoped.", "NTA. Huge red flag that he is dictating how you keep and spend YOUR ASSETS.  Sounds controlling and I would make sure to get a prenup with a man like that.  I wouldn't trust him not to financially abuse you.", "NAH - its your ring to do what you want with. \n\nPersonally though, id sell it if I were you.", "NTA.....but I couldn't look at you the same way.", "NAH, you both have valid concerns. Your ex husband told you to keep the ring and you agreed with him. Your now husband wants to sell it, so you can invest in savings. You both are in a dilemma. You both need to make a wise choice.

The ring is yours to do as you like.", "NTA. It's not up to Mark what should or should not have meaning for you, or that holding onto it is in any way telling. Mark sounds incredibly insecure and should take a deep breath.", "Q: if you don\u2019t consider it as something you would sell, why would you list it as an asset?", "Are you & FH on equal footing financially(or will you be when done with school?)  I get a whiff of him wanting to make use of your assets.  NTA", "NTA. The ring is your property, so it's yours to do what you want with it. I can also see where he's coming from in wanting to do what you both can to invest in your future together. All he can do is tell you his opinion on the matter but in the end it's 100% your decision.", "NTA. If your contribution is needed for the house, you can wait until you can comfortably make the contribution. I agree that using your ex's gift to finance a new relationship feels wrong, so not comfortable.", "It\u2019s your ring and your decision. But his behavior may be a harbinger of how he will try to handle financial matters. You might want to have a serious discussion about how you will deal with finances.  \n\nNTA", ">He said it was showing that I didn\u2019t care about us if I could be putting a significant amount towards our future together and choose not to \n\nSo how much ready cash does *he* have in the bank to put down on a home purchase right this moment?", "NTA. That ring represents a significant part and period of your life that changed and taught you and developed you in some way. To get rid of it by pawning it for some money would be a disrespect to what that period of your life means for you, even if it had to come to an end. He needs to respect the place of history in your life. Even if he thinks it's a competition, it's not. Simply a part of your history that contributed to how you are the way you sre and who you are now.", "NTA - but this is an interesting opportunity to look at your feelings on assets vs. sentimental items. \n\nI would have zero problem selling the ring if I needed to in order to accomplish a big financial goal. Wedding wouldn't cut it, but buying a house would definitely fit the bill. I'm not super sentimental about things. \n\nIt sounds like your fianc\u00e9 may be similar. He is looking at the ring as an asset and you are not. You are looking at it as an heirloom, something deeply meaningful but whose monetary value would never be enough to give it up. \n\nI would use this is as an opportunity to make sure you're on the same page moving forward. He seems awfully insistent on it, almost entitled to the ring. Would you be afraid that he's going to sell something out from under you if he deemed the household in need of the financial boost?\n\nThis same disconnect could manifest itself later when it comes to buying another house. Will he push you to sell in order to upgrade, looking at it as an investment and for financial gain? Would you feel unable to give up the house because you feel a connection to it? What about an inherited item?\n\nThis may very well be the last time the situation arises, but it's just something to think about long-term.", "Have you had it appraised?", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t do anything with that ring. He\u2019s manipulating you.", "NTA.", "If he can't respect something so important to you now, so early on, what hope do you have for the future OP?", "NTA but I'd be very hesitant to marry Mark at this point.  He's sounding a bit like he might be controlling in the long run.", "NTA. The ring is yours. If YOU wanted to sell it, for whatever reason, I think you would be fine.

Mark should not be trying to benefit from your previous heart ache.", "NTA,  the ring was a gift, and as such, it is solely your asset.  If you sell the ring and comingle the money into a jointly owned  account or home, you have just gifted Mark half of the value unless he can match your contribution to the down payment.   I would speak to an attorney before you get financially involved with your new partner.", "I don\u2019t get it - the resale value of the engagement ring with your ex is worth 30k - and you aren\u2019t selling it?\n\nIt seems like even your ex husband wouldn\u2019t even care about the ring (by your admission!) being on sale - after all it signifies something in the past\n\nhonestly it just seems like you\u2019re not over your ex - and the refusal to part from the ring signifies that. I\u2019m not surprised that your current partner is so adamant about this issue. After all, it\u2019s not just about the ring, it\u2019s about whether you are truly ready for a new relationship \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYTA\n\nedit: op has 240k medical school debt, it\u2019s ludicrous that she believes that she\u2019ll even be in a good financial position for a wedding/house like yikes", "NTA, OP if it\u2019s really about finances for your new partner, and not insecurity surrounding your ex, you should look into the actual resale value of engagement rings with him. *It\u2019s abysmal*, your appraisal might list a high value price but that\u2019s mostly for insurance purposes (and an effective sales tool) should you have to ever replace the ring with a new one at retail value if something were to happen to it.\n\nWhat they fetch on the secondary market is a fraction of what they\u2019re worth new, designer or not. Think 20-45% of the original price.", "Anita, *darling* ...!\n\nSorry, couldn't resist. NAH I think. You have your principles and priorities, he has his. Hopefully you can work through it together.", "NTA. Neither is he. I see this a bit differently than most responders on this thread. You were reviewing finances. Smart move! It sounds like he was saying, \"Here's everything I have and it is now ours.\" What he heard is, \"This is something of significant value that I choose not to share with you.\" I can understand why he would be knocked sideway by the misalignment in values. I don't understand your reasoning about not selling it because ex paid for it and then using the money with your next husband. The ring was a gift, given freely. Your ex reiterated that in a kind and generous way. It is yours to do with \\*as you wish\\* which includes not selling it because you want to keep it. But there's nothing -- and I mean zero -- reason not to sell it if you decide that the money it represents will serve your future well. If you remain reluctant to sell it, and your BF continues to press, then, as others have pointed out, that's a major red flag that deserves your careful consideration. But if on reflection you realize that he's upset because he sees a misalignment in values, then that's something you BOTH need to consider carefully. I hope you two work it out in a way that lets you embrace each other and your future together.", "Yes! That\u2019s exactly how I feel. \n\nIf it had been an item I paid for in half or full, I wouldn\u2019t have the same problem with selling it for money. I didn\u2019t pay for it, so how can I profit off of it monetarily?", "Ask your current guy if he really wants to live in a place funded by your ex?", "The new boyfriend feels a little sus, insisting that OP sell the ring to put towards a home for them.", "Funny you mention my student loans. I actually asked my ex husband for advice about it, and he suggested selling it and putting it towards my student loans if I didn\u2019t want to have it around anymore. I\u2019m a bit sad Mark didn\u2019t say the same thing as you say it too.", "I agree.  I suggest a long engagement to see how this works itself out in the long run.", "Diamond engagement rings are actually worth a lot less than most people pay for them. Just try selling it back to a jeweler and see. If I were in OP's place, with a ring that doesn't carry negative memories, I'd keep it for a future child. Maybe so my son doesn't have to pay an arm and a leg for something that isn't really worth that much in monetary terms.", "I think the ring is insured for 60k and resale value would be around 30k. Which is much less than my ex paid for it, so it feels even worse to sell it. I\u2019d rather just turn it into a necklace or keep for a future child to use.", "Am appraisal is for insurance so that you know how much it would cost to replace the ring. You're not going to be able to sell it for the appraised value.\n\nA jewelry store will give you, at most, their wholesale price, the amount that they pay their supplier. That's going to be half of the retail price, maybe less.\n\nIf you can find someone who wants to purchase it, great, but they're not going to pay the appraised value either, when they could get a brand new ring of their choosing for the same price.\n\nThe ring does not have the cash value that Mark thinks it does.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019d actually steal it. I\u2019m sure Mark isn\u2019t actually vengeful or mean spirited. He\u2019s just frustrated by my inability to match his financial situation and where he wants to be in life. \n\nI will however move the ring from where he knows it is, just to be safe.", "That\u2019s not quite true. Because if I say my 30k ring is ours, then my 240k of med school debt would also be ours to share. And that\u2019s definitely not something he is thinking.", "But not only you, but Mark profiting off of it. I completely get it. It just feels like bad karma to me\u2026 especially when it sounds like your divorce ended amicably.", "Tbh designer engagement rings (Tiffany, Cartier, harry winston, etc) rarely hold significantly more value than any other diamond ring with the same specs. \n\nMy FIL is a jeweler and he\u2019s said that the best option to recoup money is to sell directly to someone that\u2019s looking for a designer ring, but even then most people that would spend that much are more likely to buy their own. There\u2019s literally nothing special about the diamond as all diamonds are rated on the same scale. Fine jewelry is notoriously overpriced. \n\nBut that\u2019s beside the point. NTA cuz you\u2019ve offered to get rid of it.", "I agree with pretty much everything everyone has said in this whole thread. But I'm not always the most sentimental type regarding such jewelry. You certainly can be though; all good wherever you stand. I could understand if you have a child to pass it onto but you didn't mention one. You seem to think it's improper to sell it simply because it was a gift paid for by your ex. Okay, that's fine. But is there any other reason to keep it? Maybe you want to make it into other jewelry. But maybe it's value would be better served for life's expenses. While your ex alludes to using its value towards a future home, I'd be inclined to put it towards paying down your student loans. That way the value would be spent on you ... not you and your boyfriend. Again, all up to you. No judgement. So it's a pretty (expensive) ring made of metal and stone. What if instead it were a car that was gifted to you. Would you park it in a garage to never be driven? Or would you sell the car and use the proceeds for other uses? Again, just trying to give a different viewpoint for consideration. I'm not really addressing any emotional attachment nor your boyfriend's comments. You're also *only* two (2) years into this current relationship. It's great to have financial talks etc, but learn from them, get to know who your boyfriend is and how he thinks. That, too, is a major part of a relationship. It's not all sex and loving feelings (unfortunately).", "Take away the money issue for a moment.  Your divorce was amicable. If other relationships of his weren't like this he doesn't understand.  You still have what he perceives as a tie to your ex. Is he jealous of that?", "Follow this advice and don\u2019t marry Mark. Seriously. He sounds like a downgrade of your ex and we only do upgrades honey. Better to be alone than with the wrong partner.", "Sounds like you get along better with your ex husband than Marcus.  Is Marcus bothered by the fact that you & ex are still amicable?  Or is your ex just a better match for you?", "Yup. That's why it's a good idea to get it looked at and compare resale prices. Mark is making the same mistake most people do and is thinking \"it's a 2ct Tiffany and the Tiffany website says it's this much.\"\n\nNope! As soon as you drive it off the lot it's not worth nearly what it originally costed. That's just the way the industry works.", "My grandmother saved her ring from my dad\u2019s father, had it reset in a ring she designed and then gave it to me before she passed away.

Keep the ring because you can sell it later for something YOU need. His demand that you sell it to make a payment on a house is shady.", "Exactly so, OP. It has to the positive along with the negative!", "I'm not suggesting that I know the right way to share your money and debts. I'm suggesting that his reason for being confused/upset is understandable. That doesn't make him an AH. Ultimately, it's whatever the two of you decide \\*together\\*.

He didn't suggest you pay down your student loans with the ring. But he's more than happy to benefit from your ex's money. \n\nMaybe spend some time working out a prenuptial and meeting with a financial counselor.", "NTA... The ring is yours to do with as you please. BF is attaching a variety of meanings to it that are fiction.

If your ex genuinely wants you to be happy, and you want to be with mark, you should have no problem selling the ring (other than his sense of entitlement) to build your future.

Your fiance should back off and respect your past.", "NTA. Get rid of the new boyfriend", "NTA but there\u2019s no reason for you to feel anything negative about selling it. It\u2019s yours.", "Looking only at the financial side of this, it is a really bad idea to buy a home together using your ring. Currently you have a large asset which is in your sole name. If you convert that ring to cash and buy a house jointly with your boyfriend the funds from that ring are comingled and, particularly if you get married, that house becomes marital property. It would be very difficult to later argue, if things didn't work out, that your share of the home was much larger. You could quite easily be ending up gifting your fiance half the money you get from the ring your ex husband bought for you.", "This ring isn\u2019t the new boytoys business.\n\nI Love the idea of using it for another jewelry. But until he buys you a Diamond you keep yours girl", "Nta", "NTA. This is your asset to dispose of if and as you see fit.  Mark has no right to ask you to use it in any way. Frankly it is a red flag that Mark makes demands out of your finances. You already gave 2 perfectly good reasonable options to work with him. And he still insists you get rid of the ring ? Why?\n\nI think Mark realises he probably can never match your previous engagement ring and feels insecure and jealous of it. And even if he matched the value he probably is not the kind of person who would leave such an expensive ring as a gift to an ex. This shows his character and insecurity and i would be very vary of moving in with him. \n\nRight now you are probably not matching his level of income but in future you might or surpass him. If he cannot get rid of his insecurity in the first few years and simply understand your perspective don't expect him to do that when all this insecurity stews over the years and eventually blows up in your face. \n\nFrankly i don't think Mark's behaviour regarding your money/assets is good and it raises a lot of questions for me. I would be questioning the future of the relationship.", "NTA \n\nWhat if this piece of jewelry was something that had been passed on for generations, something left to you from a family member in their will, or anything sentimental other than a ring from your ex?  Would Mark still be demanding that you sell it and use the money for a house?  This ring is sentimental to you, and only you get to decide what to do with your possessions.  To me it sounds like Mark either has issues with you being on good terms with your ex, or is only seeing dollar signs when he looks at you especially since you are working in the medical field, or a combination of both.  If you choose to continue this relationship,  make sure you have a lawyer advice on major decisions and a prenuptial agreement.", "I was also going to suggest selling it to hep pay her student loans! And it even sounds like her ex husband is on board with that. This could also help her not feel like her ex is funding her new life. She\u2019s the one who mainly benefits, but a lower debt-to -income ratio could also help when looking for loans for a new house.", "This is beautifully put. Thank you for this.", "You could get a quote on reselling it, and after the big disappointment it will be a non issue I hope.

He\u2019s investing in the future of relationship, and wants you to do the same. But the only asset you have, you\u2019re not willing to throw into the pot. I can see how that would be frustrating.  He wants to buy a house with his partner and at the end of the day \u2014 you\u2019re not ready for that. \n\nIt is obviously your ring and you can do with it what you want. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for people to make it seem to make it seem like he\u2019s scheming for your money if he\u2019s putting in to the pot as well. You guys just don\u2019t see eye to eye on the issue.", "NTA and don't do it.  I find it disturbing that his first thought upon finding out how valuable the ring is was to basically demand you sell it and put the money towards \"our\" future.  That usually involves a joint account, which would give Mark as much right to the money as you.  Right now the ring is your separate, personal property.  If it is that valuable and you do decide - for whatever reason - to sell it, make sure the proceeds go into a separate account and do not give Mark access to that account, not even to make a deposit.\n\nHim trying to guilt you into selling the ring is not a good sign; be very careful with your money, accounts and property, and if you do marry, get a pre-nup first.", "NTA and I don't get the rush to buy a house together. The wait for you to get a job is not that long, but do you really want to move in together in a home that you're buying? It seems really rash... a lot of relationship issues don't come up until you live together - I think it'd be much more prudent to start with a rental you can both afford.", "OP, the ring is your property and what you do with it is none of Mark\u2019s business. My cousin\u2019s wife showed up to a family function wearing the most lovely necklace I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I asked her about it and it was her former engagement ring. You have worked very hard as a medical student and resident. Treat yourself with something nice. If Mark says you are selfish, claim it with pride. You worked hard for that degree.  As a doctor, you are starting out in debt; however, you now have options. I have a different family member who signed a 3 year contract with a community hospital. He received a salary and they paid all his med school loans. I am sure that you can get help with a job recruitment.  Mark seems more concerned with what you can do for Mark.  Does Mark have anything of value that he could sell toward the  cause? Have a yard sale!  I have to tell you that it would be a huge red flag for me if someone else tried to tell me what I needed to do with my possessions and my money.", "This could just be because I am from a culture that sees jewellery as simultaneously assets and non assets but NTA. Jewellery doesn\u2019t usually form the basis of  financial decisions, except for insurance. That ring means something to you, it\u2019s part of your story. He has no right to tell you to sell it, and you clearly have some kind of attachment to it. I would be more understanding if this was your husband and it was to pay down debt, but this man who is not even your fianc\u00e9 is demanding you sell something extremely personal for his benefit. Because if you use it for a down payment and then you split, 50% of the value of that ring is now his.", "I like how Mark is a controlling prick who isn't worth marrying because he suggested selling the ring, lol. \nNot once did OP say Mark demanded she sell the ring. Guy makes one suggestion, and everyone's just filling in blanks assuming shit lol.", "NTA, but you\u2019re losing the larger picture here; this is going to cause issues in your marriage.

Sure. But if he stuffed ten grand in a mattress because his ex wife gave it to him, you would rightly think he was on one! \n\nThis isn\u2019t different. You\u2019re showing more loyalties to a principle of a matter, than you are being loyal to the financial security of your future marriage. \n\nSell the ring. Not because it\u2019s about the money. Not because you\u2019re an asshole. Sell the ring because its value is just sitting in the dark doing nothing right now, and that doesn\u2019t help you, your husband, or the ring.\n\nSentimentality is only for sentimental things.

My mom and dad paid $400 for her engagement ring in the 1970s (just 1 ct), I have it now, but it\u2019s apparently very clear and unblemished or something and the few times I\u2019ve taken it in to have it sized or cleaned, every jeweler has warned me it\u2019s worth a lot and to not let people I don\u2019t know take it out of my sight. I don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s actually worth but it makes me nervous.", "Your ring is not capital to be used, it is a memento. Keep it, and refuse to sell it. If Mark insists, rethink your relationship with him.", "Oh, Girl!  Just sell that ring and use it for whatever you need. Your ex bought it for you and wanted you to keep it. He would probably be happy to know that you put the cash towards your needs.", "NTA\n\nI think this basically stalemete about your old engagement ring is kind of blessing in discuise. You're seeing how Mark operates about YOUR property when he doesn't get his way. I think his line **\"He said it was showing that I didn\u2019t care about us if I could be putting a significant amount towards our future together and choose not to in order to hold onto a ring that should have no meaning to me.\"** is quite emotionally manipulative. He's straight up retorting to 'you don't care about me/us/our future, if you don't do with your property what I want you to do with it.' That's not a good way to solve an issue or a tool to use in a relationship. \n\nMaybe hold off of BUYING a house together and continue renting together until you have your own savings, until you have better income. Also, maybe keep that ring as a rainy day's emergency fund. You don't NEED to sell it to live, your partner wants you to sell it to prove a point. But it might be, that at some point you'll need those funds more desperately and you'd be wise to hold onto it. It's only smart to have your own emergency fund just in case.", "One could compromise and talk with ex about it.\nIf ex says sell/keep the money, you are fine. You could also split the money or find any agreement with him.\n\nBut ultimately it also depends what OP really wants. \n\nA bit of a red flag that Mark only sees the money in it.", "Agreed. And if it were for something really huge, say you had some very sudden expensive medical bills for yourself or a parent or something, it would be one thing to sell the ring. Sounds like your ex might even insist, the way you describe how well your divorce went.\n\nBuying a house, in this market (assuming your in the US at least, idk how markets are anywhere else), with someone who isn't your husband or even your fianc\u00e9 yet and you've been with only a couple years isn't necessarily the best financial decision. What if you don't live together well and it causes tensions in the relationship? Things happen. (I'm not saying that you shouldn't but a house until you're married, my fiance and I are talking about buying before the wedding too, but he and I have been together 13 years and living together a LONG time now. Just be sure you can live together well first. A 1 year lease with someone definitely shows you all those little annoying things you never really noticed annoyed you before, like him biting on his spoon and dragging it on his teeth when he eats cereal, and helps you figure out if you can deal with it or just might shove the spoon down his throat one day, lol).\n\nI'm sure, as you've been married before, you know what I'm talking about. But talking about big moves to the next step in a relationship is exciting, and sometimes in the excitement, gentle reminders are needed. Just be sure before you make a financial contribution of any size to a commitment like a mortgage, that you're totally sure.\n\nI also agree with the person above who said, he sees this ring as simply something monetary that he could benefit from and you do not see it as such. He shouldn't stand to gain of of something that is yours alone and do not want to sell. You offered perfectly good compromises to show your not holding onto the relationship and a good and clear reason to not want to sell. He isn't willing to listen or accept this. Don't feel the need to set aside your own morals about the situation for his stubbornness. You are NTA.", "As lots of others are pointing out, Mark's attitude is kind of a red flag. \n\nThe ring is your personal property. You've offered lots of fair alternatives for getting rid of the ring itself. Mark *knows* you have loans, but instead of asking you to use it to pay off your debts, he is only thinking of how you can use your personal property in a way where he stands to financially benefit by half. \n\nIt feels like his attitude towards marriage is \"What's mine is mine and what's yours is also mine.\"\n\nThis reminds me of the AITAs where the partner is pressuring OP to sell the house OP already owns in order to use the proceeds to buy a \"house they can own together\". NTA", "Then consider his thinking self serving at best.\n\nMarry the person that wants the best for you.", "Paying off the loans would also free her up to invest more into a mortgage. If he's thinking the downpayment for something that is intended to be paid off over years and years MUST BE 50/50... well, that's an odd take unless he expects all mortgage payments to be 50/50 too and in marriages with a big income gap, that's often just not practical.", "Best comment on this thread.

I read several responses and don't see this mentioned, maybe I overlooked it. I don't understand the concept that the ring \" should have no meaning to you \" . Your ex-husband expressed he wanted you to keep it because regardless of how the relationship turned out, the intention of the ring was significantly to be yours and to acknowledge the role you played in his life... His impact on your life,heart, mind, time, etc. Doesn't disappear with him. His role in your life is significantly different but not nonexistent. Even if y'all turned sour and went no contact, it still happened, still shaped you. I don't think that means you're *obligated* to cherish the ring or whatever but certainly have the right to feel some type of way about it.", "I had my first engagement ring for over 40 years.  Divorced decades ago.  No sentimental value for me. Just gifted it to a relative. No problem.", "NTA\n\nThe amount you are likely to get for a used diamond is not likely to go far towards a down payment.", "Yeah, sell it! It's a reminder of your past. If you can't let that go, then you aren't ready to move on", "NTA. \n\nMy mother took the ring from her first husband (deceased) and from my father (deceased) and had the stones taken out and reset. Maybe the intention behind the ring bothers him as well. \n\nHave you thought about taking the ring and having it redesigned? Maybe a necklace or earrings. I know some hospitals have rules about jewelry so maybe wait until you have a permanent position and know the rules then make a change. A good jewelry store with a designer should be able to help.", "NTA\n\nSelling the ring would be crass. Hell, him asking you to do it was in incredibly poor taste. I like your thought process: you've shown you're prepared to get rid of it, but selling it just a bad thing to do.", "It is yours. Don't let him weasel the money out of you. Sounds like he wants a house down payment from you then is planning to dump you at the first opportunity. Put the ring in a safety deposit box along with ALL your other valuables and personal papers. Once that is done, dump his greedy ass.", "NTA\n\nBe very cautious with any partner who tries to tell you how to spend/use your money and assets.  The ring is a premarital asset, which means it's entirely your property.  What Mark wants to do (use it for a down payment on a house together) would turn your money (after selling your ring) into a joint asset).\n\nGiven this behavior, I recommend that you move slowly with the wedding planning.  See how Mark behaves once your income increases.  If, for instance, he starts expecting you to shoulder more than a fair share of date expenses or he starts asking for money, that's an enormous red flag.\n\nAlso, seriously consider getting a prenup.  Protect your future income and investments against the possibility of divorce.  If Mark throws a fit at the mention of a prenup, then that's a red flag also.", "NTA - This is a classy move and I respect you for your feelings on the ring.  Sounds like your boyfriend is more concerned about getting money than your feelings on the ring.  I would seriously think about this relationship.", "Consider this a red flag for Mark ( imo) NTA", "From a practical point of view. It means you have a safety net if things go south. That's not a bad thing to have", "You're allowed to honor your history by keeping the ring. I quite like the idea of repurposing it into new jewelry for yourself. \n \nI do agree with the other commenters on here though - slow things down with Mark. There's no need to rush.\n \nYou've said yourself that you're going to be in a much stronger financial position soon. Wait a bit, establish your independence, and maybe you'll find that Mark isn't as attractive an option as you once thought.", "But he knows your inability to match his financial situation is about to change significantly as your salary is about to increase substantially.  I\u2019m really concerned about his motives here.  He has no right to ask you to sell any of your belongings and his insistence is really worrying.  I\u2019d be passing the ring to a trusted friend or family member, there might come a time when you need to sell it to get away from a controlling and financially abusive partner.", "Well if he wants to spend his life with you, he shouldn\u2019t mind waiting for you to be financially stable on your own.
