In the divorce, he told me to keep the diamond ring. He said it had been bought with the intention of it being mine, and it had been put to good use because we had many good years together. \n\nWe both moved on, and I have been dating Mark (36) for 2 years now. We have talked about moving in together, and getting married. We\u2019re at the step where we talk about our finances, and I talked about all my assets and debts, including my old engagement ring which is a designer brand worth a significant amount. Mark said now that I am moving on with my life, I should sell the ring and put the money to our future, possibly to contribute towards a down payment for a home together. I disagreed on selling it. There is language in our divorce agreement that gave me full ownership of the ring, but it was a gift to me so it feels wrong to financially profit off of it. Plus it was paid for by my ex, so it also feels wrong to put the money towards something with a new partner. \n\nI said if the idea of me having the ring made Mark uncomfortable, I will give the ring back to my ex husband for him go sell, or I could turn it into another piece of jewelry like earrings or a necklace. Mark is upset I could have a significant amount of money for a down payment that I am refusing to use. \n\nIn full honesty, I have very little savings and deferred student loans because I went to medical school. I was a resident and fellow for 6 years, and made a very low salary while in training. This upcoming July I will have officially finished my fellowship so my new salary will be significantly higher. I have no problems paying off my own loans. It\u2019s just that I have no significant savings to put towards either a wedding or a home with Mark and selling the ring could give me a large sum of cash I refuse to on principle. \n\nI told Mark I am happy and willing to pay him rent if he wanted to buy a place and I move in with him, or we could wait until I had more savings from my new salary. He said it was showing that I didn\u2019t care about us if I could be putting a significant amount towards our future together and choose not to in order to hold onto a ring that should have no meaning to me.

And I may get downvoted for this but I don\u2019t care. Here\u2019s why: You are willing to get rid of the ring and just give it back to your ex, which shows you aren\u2019t holding onto the past relationship. It\u2019s not about the money for you. But it\u2019s about the monetary value of the ring for Mark. But you just don\u2019t want to disrespect your ex by using HIS money to finance a home for your new boyfriend, which is respectable.", "NTA and Mark is acting entitled to your possessions and your money. It may or may not have to do with trying to erase your past with another man, but the part going forward that would worry me is him trying to push you into selling your property to benefit him. \n\nI mean, notice that he didn't recommend that you sell the ring to pay off your student loans that won't be deferred much longer. That doesn't benefit him. He sounds like someone who would take advantage of you.", "NTA. It's your ring and he sounds a lil bit insecure.", "NTA \n\nHe should respect the emotional and historical value you place on it and not just see dollar signs. Feel comfortable in making your own decisions and don't be pressurized into making decisions you will regret,", "First, the ring is yours and you should do whatever you want with it, but don\u2019t give it back to your ex. It\u2019s yours and even though he purchased it, I am sure you paid for it in myriad ways while being married. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re talking about finances. If you cannot agree on how to proceed, at least you will both know how the other person feels. It may be a dealbreaker, but better to know before you marry each other. \n\nThird, your BF doesn\u2019t get to decide what\u2019s important to you and how you feel about the ring or anything else.\n\n\nNTA there may come a time when you\u2019re ready to sell it, but obviously that time is not now.", "I say NTA", "NTA and how dare he demand you sell anything? That sounds less about finances, and more about his insecurities.", "NTA. \n\nIt was a gift, nobody may force you to sell that ring.", "NTA.\n\nMost couples rent a home together before buying one. A mortgage is a huge commitment and affects both credit ratings, so renting is a trial to see if you are compatible living together before taking on debt together.", "NTA. The ring likely isn't worth at much as mark thinks it is. I'd get it appraised (even if it was in the beginning, it might have damage/wear that might affect the value) and check what comparable rings from the same designer are currently reselling for. Even if it's just to shut him up about it already.\n\nIt's really none of his business though.", "NTA\n\nIf you haven't gotten it insured DO SO NOW.\n\nIt might 'disappear', because of a 'misunderstanding' and a substantial payment on your future home has been made BY YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND, not YOU. \n\nWear it always, on a chain, or keep it locked away in a box only you have access to.\n\nBeing that he only sees it as a financial asset, I would keep it as a safeguard things go horribly wrong, and you need fast funds in the event of an emergency.", "NTA\n\nBut it DOES have meaning to you. \n\nOne of the most valuable experiences of my life was the breakup I went through with my ex who I was with for 10 years. Untangling that knot was a slow, deliberate, difficult process. I learned more about myself and about relationships from that breakup than I did from the relationship itself. I grew a lot as a person, my ex and I put a lot of work and mutual respect into the process and while we've since moved on in our lives, he's still a very important part of my history and I have a great deal of appreciation for that. If I had such a significant token from that relationship, I would hang on to it until I felt like I needed to pass it on, and who knows, maybe that will never happen and that's ok. It represents your growth and evolution as a person.  \n\nAside from the simple fact that the ring is yours and you can do what you want with it, we build upon past experiences and relationships that bring us to the present. You don't have to drop and extinguish your past in order to enter a new phase of your life, it doesn't work like that.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think you should be forced into selling anything you own, regardless of where it came from. It also sounds like you\u2019ll be in a decent position to save for a down payment in the coming years with your job so it\u2019s not even like it\u2019s your only realistic option to sell it. Maybe bf is just nervous it means you\u2019re still hung up on your ex?", "you are not. sounds like mark has an issue with money and not of his own either.\n\nbe careful with him, small red flag from a 55 year old married man who just had his 34th anniversary with his wife!\n\ngood luck!", "NTA  \nIt's an easy one: it's yours, bottom line.  It's okay for him to ask since you were reviewing assets, but the minute you communicated that you were not comfortable selling it, it should have been immediately dropped.  He was wrong to press the issue.  \nSharing a future doesn't mean that you no longer get to have boundaries.  Being an individual and being in a relationship exist at the same time.  This is a part of your past that you do not share with him or put towards your shared future at this time.  You are allowed that, and he should respect your decision.", "NTA\n\nThe ring is yours. If you want to keep it because it's a beautiful ring, keep it. If you want to sell it and use the cash to take a cruise, do that. \n\nThe ring is not Mark's and he doesn't get to decide or tell you what to do with your property.  \n\nMark sounds incredibly insecure that a tiny piece of jewelry is enough to make him shake in his boots. \n\n>He said it was showing that I didn\u2019t care about us if I could be putting a significant amount towards our future together and choose not to in order to hold onto a ring that should have no meaning to me.  \n\n\nIt does not show that you \"don't care about\" your future together if you decide not to sell your ring. \n\nYou're 32, which is still very young. You can start saving once you finish that fellowship and you're making more money. \n\nMark sounds like a crappy human being.", "NTA. It represents an important chapter in your life and you want to keep it. Mark should respect that. You will be earning money starting in July and can pay off your loans. \n\nKeep talking this through and make sure your financially compatible before you make more of an commitment. Mark doesn\u2019t sound very respectful, generous, or supportive.", "NTA - I couldn't imagine a more reasonable response you could have given to Mark. I'd probably be uncomfortable about you keeping the ring if it was somewhere you see it everyday. If it was in a keepsake box with a few of your old wedding photos that lives under the bed gathering dust then that's ok. I can fully understand that you'll have memories that you may want to share with your children.\n\nI tell you though, if I was bothered about you keeping it - the money is the last thing I'd be concerned about..", "NTA. Tell his entitled insecure self that it\u2019s your ring and that you don\u2019t have to sell it. You obviously have a plan for your life and finances and he shouldn\u2019t be demanding anything financial from you. If you need to wait until you take on a bigger salary, then do so. He can wait. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb", "NTA- If he wants to control this small speck of your past, what will he control next? Have you experienced this pattern?  CONGRTS on your career achievement!!\n\nShould you decide to sell it in the future I hope it fetches what you expect. Jewelry stores are full of engagement rings priced at a mere fraction of what the owner had hoped.", "NTA. Huge red flag that he is dictating how you keep and spend YOUR ASSETS.  Sounds controlling and I would make sure to get a prenup with a man like that.  I wouldn't trust him not to financially abuse you.", "NAH - its your ring to do what you want with. \n\nPersonally though, id sell it if I were you.", "NTA.....but I couldn't look at you the same way.", "NAH, you both have valid concerns. Your ex husband told you to keep the ring and you agreed with him. Your now husband wants to sell it, so you can invest in savings. You both are in a dilemma. You both need to make a wise choice.

The ring is yours to do as you like.", "NTA. It's not up to Mark what should or should not have meaning for you, or that holding onto it is in any way telling. Mark sounds incredibly insecure and should take a deep breath.", "Q: if you don\u2019t consider it as something you would sell, why would you list it as an asset?", "Are you & FH on equal footing financially(or will you be when done with school?)  I get a whiff of him wanting to make use of your assets.  NTA", "NTA. The ring is your property, so it's yours to do what you want with it. I can also see where he's coming from in wanting to do what you both can to invest in your future together. All he can do is tell you his opinion on the matter but in the end it's 100% your decision.", "NTA. If your contribution is needed for the house, you can wait until you can comfortably make the contribution. I agree that using your ex's gift to finance a new relationship feels wrong, so not comfortable.", "It\u2019s your ring and your decision. But his behavior may be a harbinger of how he will try to handle financial matters.

That ring represents a significant part and period of your life that changed and taught you and developed you in some way. To get rid of it by pawning it for some money would be a disrespect to what that period of your life means for you, even if it had to come to an end. He needs to respect the place of history in your life. Even if he thinks it's a competition, it's not. Simply a part of your history that contributed to how you are the way you sre and who you are now.", "NTA - but this is an interesting opportunity to look at your feelings on assets vs. sentimental items. \n\nI would have zero problem selling the ring if I needed to in order to accomplish a big financial goal. Wedding wouldn't cut it, but buying a house would definitely fit the bill. I'm not super sentimental about things. \n\nIt sounds like your fianc\u00e9 may be similar. He is looking at the ring as an asset and you are not. You are looking at it as an heirloom, something deeply meaningful but whose monetary value would never be enough to give it up. \n\nI would use this is as an opportunity to make sure you're on the same page moving forward. He seems awfully insistent on it, almost entitled to the ring. Would you be afraid that he's going to sell something out from under you if he deemed the household in need of the financial boost?\n\nThis same disconnect could manifest itself later when it comes to buying another house. Will he push you to sell in order to upgrade, looking at it as an investment and for financial gain? Would you feel unable to give up the house because you feel a connection to it? What about an inherited item?\n\nThis may very well be the last time the situation arises, but it's just something to think about long-term.", "Have you had it appraised?", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t do anything with that ring. He\u2019s manipulating you.", "NTA.", "If he can't respect something so important to you now, so early on, what hope do you have for the future OP?", "NTA but I'd be very hesitant to marry Mark at this point.  He's sounding a bit like he might be controlling in the long run.", "NTA. The ring is yours. If YOU wanted to sell it, for whatever reason, I think you would be fine. But you don\u2019t so that should be the end of the discussion.", "NTA And if you ever do sell it, the profits should solely be yours. Mark should not be trying to benefit from your previous heart ache.", "NTA,  the ring was a gift, and as such, it is solely your asset.  If you sell the ring and comingle the money into a jointly owned  account or home, you have just gifted Mark half of the value unless he can match your contribution to the down payment.   I would speak to an attorney before you get financially involved with your new partner.", "I don\u2019t get it - the resale value of the engagement ring with your ex is worth 30k - and you aren\u2019t selling it?\n\nIt seems like even your ex husband wouldn\u2019t even care about the ring (by your admission!) being on sale - after all it signifies something in the past\n\nhonestly it just seems like you\u2019re not over your ex - and the refusal to part from the ring signifies that. I\u2019m not surprised that your current partner is so adamant about this issue.

Think 20-45% of the original price.", "Anita, *darling* ...!\n\nSorry, couldn't resist. NAH I think. You have your principles and priorities, he has his. Hopefully you can work through it together.", "NTA. Neither is he. I see this a bit differently than most responders on this thread. You were reviewing finances. Smart move! It sounds like he was saying, \"Here's everything I have and it is now ours.\" What he heard is, \"This is something of significant value that I choose not to share with you.\" I can understand why he would be knocked sideway by the misalignment in values. I don't understand your reasoning about not selling it because ex paid for it and then using the money with your next husband. The ring was a gift, given freely. Your ex reiterated that in a kind and generous way. It is yours to do with \\*as you wish\\* which includes not selling it because you want to keep it. But there's nothing -- and I mean zero -- reason not to sell it if you decide that the money it represents will serve your future well. If you remain reluctant to sell it, and your BF continues to press, then, as others have pointed out, that's a major red flag that deserves your careful consideration. But if on reflection you realize that he's upset because he sees a misalignment in values, then that's something you BOTH need to consider carefully. I hope you two work it out in a way that lets you embrace each other and your future together.", "Yes! That\u2019s exactly how I feel. \n\nIf it had been an item I paid for in half or full, I wouldn\u2019t have the same problem with selling it for money. I didn\u2019t pay for it, so how can I profit off of it monetarily?", "Ask your current guy if he really wants to live in a place funded by your ex?", "The new boyfriend feels a little sus, insisting that OP sell the ring to put towards a home for them.", "Funny you mention my student loans. I actually asked my ex husband for advice about it, and he suggested selling it and putting it towards my student loans if I didn\u2019t want to have it around anymore. I\u2019m a bit sad Mark didn\u2019t say the same thing as you say it too.", "I agree.  I suggest a long engagement to see how this works itself out in the long run.", "Diamond engagement rings are actually worth a lot less than most people pay for them. Just try selling it back to a jeweler and see. If I were in OP's place, with a ring that doesn't carry negative memories, I'd keep it for a future child. Maybe so my son doesn't have to pay an arm and a leg for something that isn't really worth that much in monetary terms.", "I think the ring is insured for 60k and resale value would be around 30k. Which is much less than my ex paid for it, so it feels even worse to sell it. I\u2019d rather just turn it into a necklace or keep for a future child to use.", "Am appraisal is for insurance so that you know how much it would cost to replace the ring. You're not going to be able to sell it for the appraised value.\n\nA jewelry store will give you, at most, their wholesale price, the amount that they pay their supplier. That's going to be half of the retail price, maybe less.\n\nIf you can find someone who wants to purchase it, great, but they're not going to pay the appraised value either, when they could get a brand new ring of their choosing for the same price.\n\nThe ring does not have the cash value that Mark thinks it does.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019d actually steal it. I\u2019m sure Mark isn\u2019t actually vengeful or mean spirited. He\u2019s just frustrated by my inability to match his financial situation and where he wants to be in life. \n\nI will however move the ring from where he knows it is, just to be safe.", "That\u2019s not quite true. Because if I say my 30k ring is ours, then my 240k of med school debt would also be ours to share. And that\u2019s definitely not something he is thinking.", "But not only you, but Mark profiting off of it. I completely get it. It just feels like bad karma to me\u2026 especially when it sounds like your divorce ended amicably.", "Tbh designer engagement rings (Tiffany, Cartier, harry winston, etc) rarely hold significantly more value than any other diamond ring with the same specs. \n\nMy FIL is a jeweler and he\u2019s said that the best option to recoup money is to sell directly to someone that\u2019s looking for a designer ring, but even then most people that would spend that much are more likely to buy their own. There\u2019s literally nothing special about the diamond as all diamonds are rated on the same scale. Fine jewelry is notoriously overpriced. \n\nBut that\u2019s beside the point. NTA cuz you\u2019ve offered to get rid of it.", "I agree with pretty much everything everyone has said in this whole thread. But I'm not always the most sentimental type regarding such jewelry. You certainly can be though; all good wherever you stand. I could understand if you have a child to pass it onto but you didn't mention one. You seem to think it's improper to sell it simply because it was a gift paid for by your ex. Okay, that's fine. But is there any other reason to keep it? Maybe you want to make it into other jewelry. But maybe it's value would be better served for life's expenses. While your ex alludes to using its value towards a future home, I'd be inclined to put it towards paying down your student loans. That way the value would be spent on you ... not you and your boyfriend. Again, all up to you. No judgement. So it's a pretty (expensive) ring made of metal and stone. What if instead it were a car that was gifted to you. Would you park it in a garage to never be driven? Or would you sell the car and use the proceeds for other uses? Again, just trying to give a different viewpoint for consideration. I'm not really addressing any emotional attachment nor your boyfriend's comments. You're also *only* two (2) years into this current relationship. It's great to have financial talks etc, but learn from them, get to know who your boyfriend is and how he thinks. That, too, is a major part of a relationship. It's not all sex and loving feelings (unfortunately).", "Take away the money issue for a moment.  Your divorce was amicable. If other relationships of his weren't like this he doesn't understand.  You still have what he perceives as a tie to your ex. Is he jealous of that?", "Follow this advice and don\u2019t marry Mark. Seriously. He sounds like a downgrade of your ex and we only do upgrades honey. Better to be alone than with the wrong partner.", "Sounds like you get along better with your ex husband than Marcus.  Is Marcus bothered by the fact that you & ex are still amicable?  Or is your ex just a better match for you?", "Yup. That's why it's a good idea to get it looked at and compare resale prices. Mark is making the same mistake most people do and is thinking \"it's a 2ct Tiffany and the Tiffany website says it's this much.\"\n\nNope! As soon as you drive it off the lot it's not worth nearly what it originally costed. That's just the way the industry works.", "My grandmother saved her ring from my dad\u2019s father, had it reset in a ring she designed and then gave it to me before she passed away. I had it appraised when it was resized and they valued it higher than I would have thought because they said it was an old diamond.", "Tuck it away somewhere safe and be ready for Mark to have an issue with you wearing the necklace for reasons other than money.", "I would be prepared for him to ask why you moved it, just in case.", "The whole thing is suspicious and I wouldn't trust him. Keep the ring because you can sell it later for something YOU need. His demand that you sell it to make a payment on a house is shady.", "Exactly so, OP. It has to the positive along with the negative!", "I'm not suggesting that I know the right way to share your money and debts. I'm suggesting that his reason for being confused/upset is understandable. That doesn't make him an AH. Ultimately, it's whatever the two of you decide \\*together\\*. If you can't reach an amicable agreement, that's important information.", "Amen!", "And if he Does ask why that's something I'd be questioning as well"]}
