I told him to stop as a pumpkin had mould in it and I wasn\u2019t giving it to my son.

I told her it\u2019s not fine as it is my child, and I will not be feeding him pumpkin that has mould on it. And then I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in two weeks.

If he doesn't, he does indeed need to sack up, but not in the way MIL thinks. If he can't/won't despite her absolutely unacceptable behavior, you may have some hard choices to make.\n\nTake it a step further and make it known she is specifically not invited to your son's bday party, or to your home at all until she checks herself (which probably will never happen at her age).

For this to work, you and your partner need to be on the same page.\n\nMy grandmother was quite similar to what you say about your MIL. Her mother (my great-grandmother) fashioned herself as the matriarch of the family, and when she finally died, my grandmother thought, she was next in line and inherited the role of matriarch.

My parents told my grandmother that if she wanted to see the kids or my parents, she would have to behave. Whenever my grandmother would step over the boundaries (which she frequently did, like a little child testing the boundaries), my parents would cut contact for a month or so, until she promised to behave again.\n\nPeople like that can't be treated like adults, because they will use any bit of politeness as a way to overstep boundaries and assert themselves in your lives.\n\nThey need to hear \"This is not ok, you will not behave like this around me\".

How much value does she hold in her grandchild to pull a stunt like that? Blood doesn't make someone the best family for you, and it surely doesn't make them safe for relationships. Chasing after people who show you such little regard doesn't make them treat you better. It often gets way worse.\n\nTeaching your kid that family and people who \"care\" about you will treat you like crap and boss you around will be a detriment to them in their future relationships.
