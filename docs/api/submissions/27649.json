If he can't/won't despite her absolutely unacceptable behavior, you may have some hard choices to make.\n\nTake it a step further and make it known she is specifically not invited to your son's bday party, or to your home at all until she checks herself (which probably will never happen at her age).

For this to work, you and your partner need to be on the same page.\n\nMy grandmother was quite similar to what you say about your MIL. Her mother (my great-grandmother) fashioned herself as the matriarch of the family, and when she finally died, my grandmother thought, she was next in line and inherited the role of matriarch.

My parents told my grandmother that if she wanted to see the kids or my parents, she would have to behave. Whenever my grandmother would step over the boundaries (which she frequently did, like a little child testing the boundaries), my parents would cut contact for a month or so, until she promised to behave again.\n\nPeople like that can't be treated like adults, because they will use any bit of politeness as a way to overstep boundaries and assert themselves in your lives.\n\nThey need to hear \"This is not ok, you will not behave like this around me\".

He may be just as sick of dealing with his overbearing mom as you are.", "OP this is the hill to die on.  You need to know that your husband is on your side.  He should have shut down his mother when she was so awful to you during pregnancy.\n\nYou need to sit him down and have a stern conversation with him.  Share [this article](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/molds-food-are-they-dangerous#:~:text=Some%20molds%20cause%20allergic%20reactions,that%20can%20make%20people%20sick) with him on moulds in food.  Say that there\u2019s been lots of research on this and allergies and gut health, which is why what would have been acceptable decades ago is no longer the case now.\n\nLet him know that his mother doesn\u2019t have your child\u2019s best interests at heart, and you feel like she\u2019s always playing a game of one upmanship with you, which is not acceptable.  Say that you need to establish clear and firm boundaries with his mother and to do this, you need to be a strong team.\n\nLet him know that if he can\u2019t commit to this, that you will be re-evaluating your relationship.\n\nOP, if you don\u2019t resolve this now, you will be dealing with this nonsense for ever more.\n\nNTA", "If it does, then he doesn't have your back. He probably is a mommas boy.", "Then, you will know where you stand with your husband.", "Why did he tell you what she said? Was it to make a passive-aggressive jab at you, or was it so you would put his mom in check for him? I'm suspicious of this part. \n\nDepending on the answer, you may have a SO problem and not just a MIL one.", "I was the kid who had to respect Dad's mom while she disrespected my mom. It was one of the biggest confusions of my childhood. So I'm sure if your son could participate in this conversation, he'd tell you, \"no one's allowed to be mean to my mommy!\" And if hubs has a problem with it, remind him that he's kind of doing the same thing by choosing his mom's feelings and making it a problem with you.\n\nI'm sorry you're in this situation. But I'm proud of you for holding your ground. Someone else can read your post and be like, \"that's right, I'm gonna hold my ground, too!\"", "I don't think you were wrong to let them see your MIL as long as your partner was there the whole time.  No one should have to choose between their mother and their wife.  That being said, it would be telling if he doesn't take up for you,", "Don't regret that.  He loves you and his Mum, and regardless of how much you dislike her, at least you know that he will bring your child up to respect his mother, as that is how he has been bought up.", "Don't regret that.

I get so mad at some of these MIL\u2019s that I could scream!", "bouncy caste and ice cream cake....that will make the kids demand to come, send the kids the invites just like any  kids Bday......", "There are a few other things as well (e.g. maple syrup), but it's definitely the exception and not the rule. And even then you need to be careful.\n\nMissing on the side of caution is a very wise choice when it comes to mouldy food.", "Thanks.  It was 40 years ago so I'm not day-to-day traumatized, but it was certainly formative to my family.  And very much shaped my parenting as well as offering a few challenges (I grit my teeth when they ride their bikes, but don't let them see it and actively encourage this healthy activity).  As for my MIL, I'm more sorry for my wife that this is her mom - I've got a great mom (and my wife is a great mom).  Sucks to have a boundary-stomping selfish mom.", "I hope so!", "I'm 45 and I admit that there is a lot of survivorship bias going on in our generation and older.  But if you take a minute and think back, it is pretty easy to look back and see people who didn't survive or were really hurt.   Like 1 out of three of my mother's children died because in 1976, our hospital system didn't have a NICU.  My younger brother was born even earlier in 1980 and he survived.   We all knew kids who died in car accidents, biking accidents, hunting accidents.  We all knew kids who weren't the same after them.  \n\nPeople act like life hasn't changed, but I've seen the changes in my lifetime. And a lot of that is better safety protocols."]}
