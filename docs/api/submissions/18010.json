I, James, male 58, am in some hot water with my family and thought this would be a good place to get a neutral opinion. My grandson, I'll call him Henry, male 27, often comes with me to play golf. We've been doing this since he was a child and it's a tradition that we hold at least twice a month. Recently, he's started bringing his girlfriend, I'll call her Georgia, a 25-year-old girl. She doesn't usually play with us, which is fine. She often sits in the golf cart and reads or listens to music and gives us snacks and drinks when we ask. She's a nice girl who I  approve of my grandson being with, but there's only one problem. Henry often talks down to her, belittling her intelligence and sometimes just making fun of her. It makes me uncomfortable and I  can see on her face that she doesn't like it, but she never says anything.\n\nWe went to a party recently for one of my other grandkids, and Georgia came. Once again, Henry started belittling her, calling her stupid and telling her \"not to fill up her plate too much.\" I  pulled him aside and out of the room and told him that he needed to be nicer to Georgia.  I admit I  went off a bit and raised my voice, but I  didn't realize how much I  raised it. I  was apparently yelling at him for about 10 minutes and then left. A lot of people heard and asked him what happened but he just left with Georgia. The day after the party, his parents, my daughter, and her husband, told me that it was none of my business what was going on in Henry's relationship and that I  needed to apologize for trying to wedge myself in.  They keep calling me asking for an apology but I  don't want to. AITA? I  think I  might be because I  embarrassed my grandson in front of our family.\n\nEdit: I  admit, I  lied about our ages. I'm not comfortable putting our real ages here but when I didn't put it in the first draft of this post it was deleted, so I  just picked some random numbers. I'm sorry for any confusion this caused anyone, I  didn't think it was a big deal.", "created_utc": 1684866175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pwdq0/aita_for_yelling_at_my_grandson/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good luck!", "NTA.\n\n>> it was none of my business what was going on in Henry\u2019s relationship\n\nHe *made it your business* when he continually mistreated his girlfriend in front of you.

You should have said something the first time he treated her poorly in front of you and kept at it EVERY TIME.", "NTA...buts it's really none of your business. Georgia will eventually figure it out, get tired of it and leave. It's will be a hard lesson for your grandson but a lesson none the less. My one concern is,  is this a learned behavior?  As in does his father treat his mother that way?", "ESH.   He is being a jerk, and if he is an adult he deserved to be corrected.   You are wrong for waiting until you were angry to discuss this.   The family for taking sides, again depending on age of grandson.  If a minor, parents are right to intervene.", "ESH.  Not for what you said and did, but for how you said and did it.  You don't need to call your grandson out in the middle of a party, especially at high volume. You could have quietly said, \"We're going to have to discuss your behavior towards your girlfriend later,\" and then you could have unleashed to your heart's content in a more private setting later. His parents are wrong that this is none of your business. If they had done a proper job of teaching their kid how to treat others with respect, you wouldn't have had to step in. It's ironic that they're so offended by your \"overstepping\" when your grandson himself is overstepping by literally trying to control what his girlfriend eats.

You saw your own flesh and blood being disrespectful to his partner, girlfriend or not.  My guess is you didn't raised your own children to do that and when you witnessed your grandson, with whom you spend quite a bit of time & your flesh and blood, you decided it needed to be pointed out.  My further impression is you were just a little too loud to drive the point home.  And, maybe your grandson should be embarrassed, he got something similar that he was dishing out.\n\nMy question:  where did he learn that behavior?  Do his parents belittle each other?  \n\nAnyways, kudos to you for caring not only about family but how that family treats others.", "NTA. as someone who has been in her position before, thank you for standing up for her. We need more people like you. If being told to treat her better embarrassed him, then he should be embarrassed. You did nothing wrong.", "Nta.

Since he displays this kind of behavior makes me think he learned it from a parent", "NTA. You were mad at him for treating his partner poorly and being an AH to her.

IMO there are 2 ways your family is thinking 1. those around him were ashamed that they didn't call him out on his behavior earlier or 2. They don't see any issue with it. Either way you did the right thing calling him out on his behavior and one can only hope that he grows and changes because of it.", "NTA I spent my early teenage years in a relationship where I was belittled by my boyfriend and his mom. His dad\u2019s mom, aka grandma stood up for me. Thank you for being Georgia\u2019s peace.

Not all heroes wear capes. Good for you for sticking up for the young lady. Sounds like your grandson was not raised as a gentleman in how to treat a partner. Hope she gets her self esteem in order and kicks him to the curb if he doesn\u2019t take your words to heart.", "NTA.\n\nVerbal/emotional abuse is *everyone's* business.

Hanging around while you 2 actually do something strikes me as needy for a woman in her 20's who should have lots going on in her life.  If your grandchild thinks she is only arm candy, thats unhealthy for both of them", "NTA. It's brilliant of you to stand up for her. When I was with my ex I always remember a family meal where his uncle who I barely even knew actually told him off for the way he spoke to me/treated me. It validated so many of my feelings on how I was being treated which I thought were all just in my head because we were only ever around his family and they all acted like it was normal.\n\nYou're a good person.", "NTA.

They owe Georgia an apology.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t care what ages are real, but the brain doesn\u2019t stop developing until the late 20s. He may still have literal growing up to do not just emotional maturation. \n\nYelling was likely unproductive but good for you for calling him out on his condescending and misogynistic behavior and attitude. \n\nI sincerely hope someone can get through to him before it\u2019s too late for him to turn into an emotionally healthy and kind person.", "NTA. if i can give you any sort of advice keep an eye out for signs of a mentally abusive relationship. keep helping other people.", "NTA.
