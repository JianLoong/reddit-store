I, James, male 58, am in some hot water with my family and thought this would be a good place to get a neutral opinion. My grandson, I'll call him Henry, male 27, often comes with me to play golf. We've been doing this since he was a child and it's a tradition that we hold at least twice a month. Recently, he's started bringing his girlfriend, I'll call her Georgia, a 25-year-old girl. She doesn't usually play with us, which is fine. She often sits in the golf cart and reads or listens to music and gives us snacks and drinks when we ask. She's a nice girl who I  approve of my grandson being with, but there's only one problem. Henry often talks down to her, belittling her intelligence and sometimes just making fun of her. It makes me uncomfortable and I  can see on her face that she doesn't like it, but she never says anything.\n\nWe went to a party recently for one of my other grandkids, and Georgia came. Once again, Henry started belittling her, calling her stupid and telling her \"not to fill up her plate too much.\" I  pulled him aside and out of the room and told him that he needed to be nicer to Georgia.  I admit I  went off a bit and raised my voice, but I  didn't realize how much I  raised it. I  was apparently yelling at him for about 10 minutes and then left. A lot of people heard and asked him what happened but he just left with Georgia. The day after the party, his parents, my daughter, and her husband, told me that it was none of my business what was going on in Henry's relationship and that I  needed to apologize for trying to wedge myself in.  They keep calling me asking for an apology but I  don't want to. AITA? I  think I  might be because I  embarrassed my grandson in front of our family.\n\nEdit: I  admit, I  lied about our ages. I'm not comfortable putting our real ages here but when I didn't put it in the first draft of this post it was deleted, so I  just picked some random numbers.

You saw your own flesh and blood being disrespectful to his partner, girlfriend or not.  My guess is you didn't raised your own children to do that and when you witnessed your grandson, with whom you spend quite a bit of time & your flesh and blood, you decided it needed to be pointed out.  My further impression is you were just a little too loud to drive the point home.

IMO there are 2 ways your family is thinking 1. those around him were ashamed that they didn't call him out on his behavior earlier or 2. They don't see any issue with it. Either way you did the right thing calling him out on his behavior and one can only hope that he grows and changes because of it.", "NTA I spent my early teenage years in a relationship where I was belittled by my boyfriend and his mom.

Hanging around while you 2 actually do something strikes me as needy for a woman in her 20's who should have lots going on in her life.

When I was with my ex I always remember a family meal where his uncle who I barely even knew actually told him off for the way he spoke to me/treated me.

I figured it wasn't his immediate family but it never hurts to ask, only to make assumptions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, kind sir, I applaud you and thank you for your efforts to make your grandson a better man :)  In fact, most women would agree - you are a hero!", "Basically, don't dish it if you can't take it.

Up until then you were on the right track.", "NTA, but it makes me wonder if he hears his father talk to your daughter the same way!?!\nIf they are defending his actions it seems it\u2019s learnt behavior. \nKudos to you for putting him in his place!!!", "My grandpa would have done the same. He loved us all dearly. Because he loved us, he absolutely would tell us off if we were acting up. We all loved him the more for it. NTA.", "NTA. In my opinion you did the right thing in this situation. Your grandson needed to hear it from someone that his behavior isn\u2019t okay.", "NTA AND anyone who says otherwise is perpetuating this abusive behavior by looking the other way.

Hopefully your grandson heads your words and even better, may Georgie realize how she should be treated.", "NTA- and I hate to say this grandpa, but the reason your daughter reacted that way was because she\u2019s also being verbally abused. \ud83d\ude2c his behaviors clearly modeled by \u201csomeone\u201d and I\u2019m sure that someone is the reason behind why your daughter said something to you.", "If that\u2019s how he acts in public, imagine how he is in private? NTA, that was a huge win imo", "NTA.\n\nYou're a hero to those of us who have had SO's put us down, laugh at us, intimidate us, and belittle us while other men just sat there, silent. Bravo to you.", "NTA. Thank you for trying to help her.", "NTA! If he's treating her like that in public, imagine how he behaves when he thinks nobody else is watching?? Very likely it'll escalate to physical abuse if he hasn't already. He's displaying abusive behavior and others around him are enabling it. I hope this plants a seed in his gf's mind that this shouldn't be acceptable.", "NTA and please double down on his parents, you won\u2019t stand for shitty behavior, period. They probably don\u2019t have the full story.", "NTA - your grandson is wrong and you as a grandparent have an obligation to tell him so he can do better.

Maybe if more men did there would be less abuse in the world.", "NTA. Rude behavior in your presence can almost always be called out.", "NTA. So your grandson and family are not embarrassed by grandson's behavior but you for calling him out?", "NTA. You\u2019re a good grandpa.", "Maybe an apology to the gf, from grandpa. Just a simple \"hey, I'm real sorry if I put you on the spot when I spoke to my grandson, but I hope you know you deserve to be spoken to/ treated better than he's currently doing\"\n\nI can't even begin to fathom how their drive back home was, after grandpa yelled at him.

You shouldn\u2019t apologize. I hope Georgia dumps your grandson and finds someone who treats her like a queen.", "We actually have an ad campaign here in Australia about exactly this. More people need to call others out about their bad behaviour towards others. \n\nMaybe your delivery could have been better, but you damn sure got your point across. NTA.", "NTA thank you for calling him out. Honestly your daughter should consider how she would feel if her partner spoke to her the way your grandson speaks to his girlfriend. That\u2019s how he speaks to her in front of others, I can\u2019t imagine what he\u2019s like behind closed doors", "So you may have a problem with your hearing if you didn\u2019t realize you were yelling so loud that others heard.  \n\nNTA for advising your grandkid. But YTA for yelling so loud and long at him that the situation turned against you. You probably will need to apologize or your relationship with him may continue to deteriorate.", "NTA, but you could have toned it down a bit. People tend to stop listening when you shout. Someone should have a chat with the girl, too, to tell her she shouldn't put up with being treated like that.

I know I would have in her shoes. Props to you.", "NTA.", "NTA. I don't believe your grandson told them exactly what happened.  Also, he was your guest and was embarrassing you both.  If his parents really think you're wrong, I'm worried about your daughter.", "NTA Your grandson is either a current or future abuser. Belittling and controlling is how they start.", "No. Your family's position is how abuse goes unnoticed and unresolved for years on end.

This is admirable and chivalrous.", "So it\u2019s not ok for him to be embarrassed but it\u2019s ok for him to constantly embarrass and berate her? NTA.

Wtf. \nThank you for standing up for her", "NTA! Grandpas are teachers in life too and he needed a lesson!", "NTA\n\nI was fully prepared to assume you were TA. So nice to see I was wrong. The way your grandson treats his girlfriend is absolutely appalling. I\u2019m sad to hear the rest of your family doesn\u2019t have the nerve to intervene. You shouldn\u2019t apologize over this.

I was in an abusive relationship, and we sometimes went golfing with his dad just like you guys. I didn\u2019t play (like Georgia) but wandered around in the sun and read a book and was on snack duty. This is very familiar to me.\n\nYou may have saved that girl, especially if she heard you. I hope she did. No one ever stuck up for me, and I didn\u2019t know how wrong the whole thing was. His whole family thought it was none of their business, even when they eventually found out he was hitting me and screaming at me. You did so so good I\u2019m gonna cry. Thank you man, I appreciate you.", "Good going, grandpa. He learned that behavior somewhere. Hopefully you don't treat grandma that way. I'm afraid his dad might treat mom that way.

But he insulted her in public, and got what was coming to him. You would have told any random man on the street to back off if he mistreated someone, so why is your grandson any different? If he didn't want to get told off, he shouldn't have done what he did in front of somebody who had the balls to speak up to him. The rest of the family are enabling his bullying mindset.", "NTA. If that is how he treats her in public, imagine what goes on behind closed doors.  You should help her leave him.", "NTA. I am thankful that my parents openly talked to me and corrected me when I was younger when I acted like a dick. I feel it honestly made me a better person. If anything, at least more considerate.

I like when an older generation uses Reddit. I'm going to say NTA. No one should be treated like that. Maybe his gf will eventually realize that she doesn't need that kind of treatment. But ultimately it is her choice to decide when enough is enough. I thought it was sweet of you to make a comment though to try to correct his bad behavior.", "My grandma and great grandma were essentially my parents for a good part of my life. They corrected me in a lot of my wrong-doings, and I'm thankful to have had them with me.\n\nKeep doing you. Assuming these aren't just some fun jabs (my girlfriend and I often poke fun at each other, but it's never serious), then it sounds like your daughter should be helpful that you're raising her son to be respectful.", "We learn how to be good people from other good people. I'm glad that you talked to him about it. It's hard to stand by and witness someone hurting someone else. I wouldn't have been able to wait until later. If anything, maybe the girlfriend figures out how others should treat her.", "To be fair a 17yo being an immature ass and a 27yo verbally abusing his gf is a (at least slightly) different situation.
