She effed around and found out that Google makes a bad lawyer. This is a highly rehearsed scheme to attempt to get out of paying rent that she\u2019s probably tried many times before. You\u2019ve probably realized this already, but letting tenants handle repairs is never a good idea. You give them an inch and they take a mile.

It\u2019s more expensive but ultimately in your best interests.", "NTA oh honey, she was determined not to pay her rent. There are lots of the same words used by the non payers of rent to use. 'I had to cut my hours, I lost my job, I had to repair my car to get to work, my mum is sick I had to pay her medical bills, I'm sick, my kid is sick, you are making my child homeless, I am a struggling single mother, you do not know how hard it is.'\nMy daughter went to school with a girl who does this from rental to rental. I used to rent out treatment rooms and hairdressing chairs in a salon, so I'd get this too, even though they had clients all week, suddenly they couldnt pay me. One even said couldnt pay me rent as it was their kids birthday and was going to have a party! I grew up with my mum's friends renting houses so I had heard all this before with them. We have a rental too, but luckily we have a real nice long standing tenant right now and a great relationship. It is very difficult to seperate genuine from scam and so far all the ones I've dealt with were scamming me. At the end of the day, it is a business and loses can get really heavy. A lot of times I've been saved by my very clear and signed paperwork. If the issues start month one then she is for sure a scammer, by the time you realise it and get her out she can have had 6 months or more of free accommodation as a lot of landlords are real soft at thinking it is genuine, then slow to realise they are being taken for a ride.", "You won't be the reason, though.

She will be the reason she's homeless. The sooner she's out the better.

When I declined to renew his lease, he threatened and then did sue, saying I had harmed his mental health and was being discriminatory against him. Court tossed it out but it was exhausting.\n\nNext tenant was a single Mom with zero credit I heard from my lawyer needed help. Two years she lived there, paid on time and kept the place nice. She was able to buy a larger unit because she\u2019d been saving money with the lower rent, and now she\u2019s vp of the condo board.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with helping someone struggling. You have no obligation to feel guilty when that kindness is exploited", "NTA. Who cares if she\u2019s a single mum, that information doesn\u2019t matter here.
