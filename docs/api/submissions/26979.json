She works full-time in healthcare and is in a Masters program. Safe to say she has a lot on her plate. I (28M) work full-time but otherwise no major time commitments. \n\nAfter her recent semester ended, we went on a trip to Iceland. I planned everything from booking the flights and hotel to planning our itinerary. I was happy to do this because I know she doesn\u2019t have as much time as I do. We had an amazing time together exploring the country. The trip ended right before my birthday, but wasn\u2019t considered a birthday trip specifically. \n\nWhile we were in Iceland, we were shopping for souvenirs and she mentioned that she hadn\u2019t gotten me a birthday gift yet and said she would buy me something if I liked it. We eventually found a nice Icelandic blanket that was my gift. Not much of a surprise, but it\u2019s a beautiful blanket. \n\nA few days later after our trip, she goes back home (3hrs away) and my birthday rolls around. We weren\u2019t able to have my birthday in-person but she sends me a thoughtful text message wishing me happy birthday and we talked later like we normally do. When we did meet in-person again, we didn\u2019t really do anything to celebrate either. \n\nI don\u2019t like doing too much on my birthday, and I know we just came back from our trip, but I was a little bummed that there wasn\u2019t anything pre-planned for me. I told her that I felt like my birthday was an afterthought, because she really didn\u2019t do much besides buy me the blanket, which I love but was kind of a last second thing. Even something small like a card with a handwritten message or a dedicated birthday dinner, at a later date, would have sufficed. Based off our convo, she seems to understand where I\u2019m coming from but said she was disappointed that I didn\u2019t like my gift, which isn\u2019t the case.

You should have communicated this to her like an adult", "NAH. But be honest... I think you maybe do like to do \\*something\\* for your birthday. And that's okay. You're allowed to want even a single day of the year to be about you. Care is not a finite resource, there's no need to ration it. Maybe just go out and enjoy a belated birthday re-do dinner or something? There's no need for either of you to feel disappointed. Enjoy yourselves!", "Nah I mean u guys just went on a trip and spent so much time together and u said she's super busy. If u wanted to make a big deal out of ur bday u should have said something u even said ur not usually a big bday person", "people nit picking the littlest of things. having a dinner date is pretty chill. a text and last minute gift is verrrry minimal. a surprise party is a lot. see the difference. NTA. but some of these poster are. smdh.", "NTA. What\u2019s with all these commenters being pedantic and taking \u201cI don\u2019t like doing too much on my birthday\u201d to mean \u201cI don\u2019t like doing anything on my birthday?\u201d Seems like she put in 0 effort to celebrate or make you feel appreciated.", "I\u2019m amazed at some of these responses.

If she'd gone in the other direction, and done more than you wanted, you'd be annoyed about that too.\n\nDo you have any idea how exhausting it is trying to guess the exact amount of \"not too much, not too little\" you want? If getting it exactly right is so important to you, either plan it yourself, or tell her in advance what you want.\n\nYTA.", "Nah you can be disappointed on how your girlfriend celebrated your birthday but I do think you can give her some grace specially since you do mention she is busier then usual. I do think you need to be more clear on how you want/expect your birthday to be celebrated because a not like to do too much is open to interpretation.", "NtA.  \n\nWhen we have busy schedules we just tell the other person.  I need extra love, attention and romance tomorrow or this weekend. It can mean anything. Going out to a movie, a nice restaurant or just a movie marathon together. Communication is everything,  especially when you're feeling a bit neglected.", "YTA - your birthday wasn\u2019t an afterthought. She brought it up AND bought you a gift before the day even happened. So, you don\u2019t like to make a big deal over your birthday, but because she didn\u2019t make a big deal this year ON the day (yes, I read the comment where you clearly said she had done so before) because she\u2019s got more on her plate than usual, you want to get salty? Nope. You\u2019re one of this reverse psychology guys, aren\u2019t you?", "I don't see how your birthday was an afterthought. She told you before your birthday that she wanted to get you something you wanted, which happened to be the blanket from your trip. She sent you a thoughtful message, and you talked on your birthday.   You admit you don't like doing much on your birthday but you're disappointed because you didn't do much. It sounds confusing to me. Girlfriend didn't have the afterthought. You did. You realized you do need something, but that's not her fault. In this case, YTA. Figure out what you need and communicate it for next time. I'm guessing you want some in-person acknowledgment/celebration with her like a dinner.", "YTA - the reason why is you're all over the place.  you don't like doing much on your birthday, but you're upset you didn't do much for your birthday.  Figure yourself out and communicate your expectations.  Nobody can read your mind, and it seems even you don't really have a handle on what you want.\n\nLastly, here's some advice I got on this very sub a while back, and it's really good advice.  Birthday parties are thrown for children and parents.  If you want to have a party, or any type of event, for your own birthday, you need to plan it yourself.  Do not leave it up to other people, even those closest to you.  It's as simple as saying \"hey, I'd like to go out to dinner for my birthday, how about tuesday?\"", " NAH you guys had a big trip, she\u2019s busy, she acknowledged your birthday. You expected a little more, and she acknowledged where you\u2019re coming from. Sounds like you guys can try and do better next year.", "I'm a little shocked to see the responses here. I've seen many birthday posts and most times redditors want OP to get a divorced based on such things. She sent you a TEXT on your birthday? And people think that's completely fine? Also, there's a difference between \"not wanting much\" for his birth and not wanting anything. She didn't even bother thinking of a gift, essentially just paid for what he chose, and while that's a perfectly common method of gifting, she didn't exactly do much otherwise!\n\nAlso, unless and until the person absolutely hates having their birthday celebrated, the SO must have some excitement for the birthday too? I can't even see that here!\n\nNTA", "YTA\nYou just had a major trip\nSHE brought up your bday gift AND bought it\nShe messaged you on your birthday as well as yall spoke\nYou say yourself you don't like doing much, and have probably told her that\n\nIf you wanted more, you should've spoken up beforehand. She is not a mind reader, and if you are telling her you dont like doing much? She prob thinks you don't like doing much.", "OP, 99.9% (OK, everyone but you) of the planet would be thrilled with the birthday gift, vacation and text that you got. You are an ungrateful AH. I don't even know what to say, other than if you have these rigid, specific expectations of how events should unfold, you will spend a lifetime being disappointed.", "\"i don't like doing things on my birthday\" often gets translated as I don't like doing things but in reality it means I don't like planning things, doesn't mean you want to just sit there and do nothing on your birthday, it means you want everything taken care of for you so you don't have to worry", "NTA!! These YTA judgements are giving major clown energy (\"im usually low key on birthdays, a dinner would have been nice\" wOw wHat a LiAr hE dOeS wAnt sOmeThinG -classic reddit lmao) . You're entitled to your feelings about your birthday feeling like an afterthought, and from reading your post I don't see how anyone else can think differently. Even your girlfriend understands. She's a clown though for trying to guilt you about not like her birthday present.. a present she put zero thought or planning into considering she told you to pick out something you liked from a gift shop during a trip you planned because she hadn't actually planned a gift for you yet. Lmao. It's a nice gesture but hardly something to pat yourself on the back about and most importantly zero thoughtfulness. Yes your gf is very busy but also there's a middle ground where for special occasions she can take some initiative to do something for your birthday that is different from the mundane day to day. What you suggested like a dinner the next time you met, a card, etc. are all super bare minimum low key suggestions.", "YTA, it can be fun to celebrate your birthday on a different day. It expands your special time. Be honest with her. Tell her you made a mistake and would like a bigger celebration. Ask her if the next time she is free if you can go out for a nice dinner. It\u2019s too much to ask for another present. But not to ask for more one on one time. Communication is the key. It\u2019s normal to make mistakes like this.  Frame it in a way that she understands it\u2019s because you love her and it would be special to you  if she plans the outing. It can be romantic and inexpensive like a picnic. Be honest.", "NTA she put zero effort into celebrating something for you where in contrast you planned an entire trip for her", "Info: how long have you been together? Has she put in effort in the past and this is just an off year because she's so busy?", ">I don\u2019t like doing too much on my birthday,\n\n*Proceeds to write a whole post about feeling bummed out for doing nothing special on his birthday* \n\nYou clearly do like doing stuff on your birthday. And that is fine. But you can't tell the world and your girlfriend the opposite, then be hurt when she planned nothing special on the day, having just returned from an expensive trip, and being busy with work and studies. \n\nGentle YTA because you just need to learn how to communicate what you actually like and want.", "YTA.  You know she's super busy, don't like doing too much for your birthday then you get mad when a big deal wasn't made for your birthday.", "NTA\n\nAnd that's a pretty manipulative comment to tell you that she was disappointed that you didn't like the blanket. Gaslighting 101.", "Context:\n\nHow long have you been together? Have you been together long enough to have celebrated birthdays in the past?", "Soft YTA. I understand you are disappointed, but I think that may have been better to keep to yourself. You do mention your girlfriend is very busy and she did text you and call you.\n\nYou mention you don\u2019t like doing anything for your birthday. She may have heard you say this and decided not to do anything out of respect for this. I think you should try to communicate better with her before, because saying one thing, then being disappointed when they follow your request isn\u2019t fair.", "YTA: both women and men cannot read minds. Admittedly she has a lot on her plate and double admission you don\u2019t like a big fuss\u2026 the blanket and thoughtful Text want enough - then say so\u2026 \u201choney, I was hoping we could do something to mark my 28th birthday occasion - Chilis happy hour?\u201d  \n\nAs a husband and Dad, I\u2019m not much for birthdays as long as we do something together\u2026 but if I did want more I\u2019d certainly communicate it!", "Sorry sir...you're 28 years old, not 8.  The world no longer comes to a stop just because you had a birthday.  GF went to Iceland with you (demonstrating some level of commitment), acknowledged you're upcoming birthday while there and purchased the souvenir (requiring forethought on her part), and then sent you a thoughtful text and phone call (she didn't forget on that day by sending you the text & then following up with a phone call later).  So yes...you're a bit of an AH, get over yourself!", "YTA grow up, how old are you? And you want a big song and dance for your birthday? You know she\u2019s busy and you still behave like a brat because she didn\u2019t make a big hoohah over it", "Sadly, YTA. Though you claim you don't like to do anything for your birthdya you clearly had expectations that you didn't vocalize to your partner. \n\nShe didn't ignore or forget your birthday in fact she sent you a thoughtful text message which is essentially akin to a card. She did get you a gift, that it wasn't a suprise is an expectations issue. \n\nA lot of your current feelings could be solved by actually making your girlfriend aware of what your expectations are towards your birthday, as in you actually do want a fuss over it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
