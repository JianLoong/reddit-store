We dated for around a year and have been friends since high school, but I broke up with her in September after I found out that Nancy was on cheating on me with one of her coworkers.\n\nNancy and I were living together in an apartment that I rent in my name. She has three pet guinea pigs that we've been keeping in the apartment.\n\nAfter the break up, Nancy moved out to go stay with a friend. She promised she'd be back in a couple of weeks to collect the guinea pigs and that she'd text me.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks I tried to call Nancy to ask about the guinea pigs and that was when I noticed she blocked my number and she blocked me on social media as well. I contacted some of Nancy's friends and siblings on Facebook trying to get through to her about the guinea pigs but everyone blanked me.\n\nI would've gone to the house in person to talk to her but I didn't know where her friend lives.\n\nI tried several more times to get through to Nancy through her relatives on Facebook including her parents and grandparents but no one was responding to me, even though I made it clear that if I don't hear anything back I will rehome the guinea pigs. Her mom replied to me but she just told me to piss off then blocked me.\n\nAfter hearing nothing back until now I just assumed Nancy wasn't going to come back for the guinea pigs. I posted an ad for them and last week I gave them away to a sweet middle aged lady who already owned some guinea pigs.\n\nApparently one of Nancy's friends saw my ad and told Nancy that I gave away her guinea pigs. She unblocked me and called me and screamed at me down the phone and said that I'm a horrible person. \n\nI asked why she didn't contact me about the guinea pigs if she was coming back for them and she said she couldn't bring herself to talk to me and that things have been hard for her. Nancy demanded that I get the guinea pigs back off of the woman and give them back to her and I refused. She said it's the least I can do since I gave them away. I told her she basically abandoned her pets so why shouldn't I.", "created_utc": 1667618914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymixlf/aita_for_giving_away_my_ex_gfs_guinea_pigs_and/", "score": 319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She didn't care about the guinea pigs until she felt she could use them as a club to beat you with. She could have come and gotten them, or she could have had a friend pick them up. She didn't love them enough to take them with her or care for them, so you're right, she abandoned them. They're better off with their new owner. \n\nP.S.

Sure, maybe she couldn't handle talking to you, but surely there is *someone* in her family or social circle who wasn't *quite* as traumatized by your breakup and could have responded to you and/or passed on your message.\n\nYou even warned that you would re-home the guinea pigs if you didn't hear from her.\n\nIf her friend hadn't found out about the re-homing, you'd never have heard from her again. She probably liked the idea of you having to chase her around and her being able to reject you, and I think she wanted this to continue indefinitely. Which *also* makes her a heartless pet owner.  \n\nIf she cared about those guinea pigs, she would have gotten them from you.  \n\nI'm guessing she thought she was playing a clever game by having you hang onto them and refusing all communication, but sadly for her, it turns out she was actually playing \"fuck around and find out.\"", "holy shit what an ahole.  her, not you. you are NTA\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder what she told her friends and family about why you broke up, to make them so angry towards you. Clearly she did not tell them she was the one cheating\n\nAnd she had the nerve to cry to you about how hard it\u2019s been for her?!\n\nShe clearly knew that you wanted her to take them back so she should have called you then. If she was worried or wanted them, she would\u2019ve got in touch no matter how emotionally \u201chard\u201d things had been for her.  I hope it\u2019s guilt that\u2019s making her feel that bad because she has no other reason for the self-pity.\n\nTake a page out of her mothers book and tell her to piss off. The guinea pigs are gone and luckily so is she.", "NTA you made every effort you could to contact her.  Tell her if she wants to scream at someone she can scream at her mother for not passing the message on.  She basically abandoned the animals while she had the option of picking them up herself or having a friend/family member to do so.  Block her - she did you a favor cheating on you and leaving.", "NTA.  Your relationship dissolved because of Nancy's actions.  She then left her guinea pigs behind and said she'd be back in two weeks to collect them, but instead blocked you.  \n\nYou humanely rehomed the guinea pigs, so tell her to go kick rocks!!!!", "NTA!\n\nI was leaning the other way, until I read the whole story.\n\nYou made every effort to get in touch and we\u2019re rebuffed.

I\u2019m pretty sure that the law would be on your side too, especially if you are in America. If your timeline is correct, she abandoned her property.
