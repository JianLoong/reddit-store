I\u2019ve met Megan a handful of times but not talked to her much as it\u2019s always with a bunch of other people there as well and games being played. \n\nTracy and I had plans to hang out on Saturday last week but mid week she called and asked if I would mind moving our hang out time to Sunday bc Saturday was Megan\u2019s actual birthday and she wanted to do the surprise party that night. I said that was fine and asked if there was anything I could do to help set up. Tracy said I could make the dessert if I wanted and I agreed. \n\nI don\u2019t like most cake and have never made one on my own so I decided to make something I knew I would have no problem making. I made Dr Pepper brownies, regular brownies, and (bc I was in the mood for them) rice Krispy treats. I took all three deserts to the party. Tracy looked at me weird but didn\u2019t say anything about the desserts and there were no left overs for me to take home at the end of the night. I left before everyone else did as I had to be up early the next morning. \n\nSunday when I came over to hang out Tracy was acting weird and I asked if everything was ok. She said she was just tired bc she had been up late baking a cake for Megan to \u201ctry and salvage\u201d her birthday. I just kind of stared at her at that point bc I didn\u2019t know how to respond. She then went into this whole thing about how after I left the night before she had to explain to everyone that I\u2019m autistic and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t follow proper social rules for the dessert. \n\nThat really bothered me bc I\u2019m not autistic (I do show some possible symptoms but I\u2019ve never been diagnosed) and everyone seemed to enjoy the desserts I made. Tracy then informed me that if I had bothered to ask her advice she would have told me Megan doesn\u2019t like brownies and thus didn\u2019t get any dessert. I left after that bc she seemed to want to argue about the whole thing and I didn\u2019t but I\u2019ve felt like an ass since then for not at least thinking to ask what dessert I should make. \n\nSo AITA here?\n\n\nETA-because I see a lot of comments about these things \n\n1-the Dr Pepper brownies I make is literally just a can of Dr Pepper and a box of brownie mix. Follow the cooking instructions on the box just don\u2019t add any other ingredients. \n\n2-all the people involved are in in their 20s and 30s. \n\n3-we usually have food when we get together for games so we are all well aware of the two food allergies. One is strawberries and is life threatening, the other is squash and is minor.", "created_utc": 1677184120, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a7tnn/aita_for_not_baking_a_cake/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who says \"the dessert\" when they mean \"the cake\"?\n\nI do understand cake at a birthday is customary, but as we age friends and family express preferences for other desserts. I've been to plenty of cake-free birthday celebrations. If birthday girl didn't like brownies, then Tracy should have told you that.\n\nMore importantly: then she talks condescending about you behind your back after you went through the trouble of making dessert for *her* friend's birthday after she was rearranging your plans? I'm really sorry she's treating you like this.", "My goodness.  NTA. Dr Pepper brownies sound good ; I am going to look them up.  Plus you were thoughtful and added a non chocolate option.  Your friend Tracy sounds like a mean girl.", "Do I have this right?\n\nYour friend, who is hosting a surprise party for her friend, asked you to make desserts for a party for her friend, and then talked shit about you to the rest of the party?\n\nNTA, while friends can certainly ask for help on surprise parties, it\u2019s weird to push responsibility beyond bringing snacks like a bag of chips or something off on a guest. And it\u2019s very poor taste to speak badly of someone that did them a huge favor, and to grump at you for not knowing her friend better.", "NTA! If this was a birthday party for someone you barely know, the host absolutely should have told you she didn\u2019t like something specific and asked if said dessert could be cake! I mean, \u201cdessert\u201d could be so many things- you\u2019re not a freaking mind reader.

You offered to bring something , you were asked to bring dessert, so you brought dessert. Tracy didn't tell you she wanted a cake, nor did she give you any guidance about what Megan liked or didn't like.

This isn't about you being autistic - this wasn't a misunderstanding - she wasn't even slightly clear.", "NTA. why did she just assume you knew dessert meant cake? also, i have no idea why she never thought to mention that megan doesn\u2019t like brownies. seems important, even if she thought you were making a cake.", "LMAO! Tracy is so messed up for that \ud83e\udd23 you don't need to bake a cake for anyone if you don't want to", "NTA - if she said \"dessert\" and not \"cake\" then its on her.

She said bring dessert, you brought dessert x 3.  She didn't specifically say, \"Don't make brownies\" or \"Can you bake the birthday cake?\"  Her vagueness is not your problem.", "NTA. She said dessert. You provided dessert. If she wanted a specific thing, she should have said the specific thing. I don\u2019t know why she expected you to be able to read her mind. Autistic or not, that\u2019s not a skill most people have.", "NTA\n\nYour friend needs to learn better communication skills.", "NTA. You made 3 desserts when she only asked for one.

Preparing 3 separate desserts, one of which was not the hated brownie.\n\nTracy threw this event together in half assed fashion if the date could be moved so easily last minute. If it needed to \"salvaged\" it was due to her own poor planning. As host she should have arranged the cake long before even involving you.  It was not your responsibility nor did she ask for it. She is probably one of the types who thinks  \"everything just works out for me\" and when it doesn't it's not her fault and she attempted to shift the fault in an offensive way.", "NTA. I am autistic. It's really fucked up to diagnosis someone else, share that diagnosis, especially if you don't have enough information to make that diagnosis and you weren't asked to. Clear communication is very important for many autistics. Imo, since you were asked to bring a dessert and NOT asked to bring ANY specific kind, you did absolutely nothing wrong. If your friend wanted cake, they should have used the word cake.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not autistic.

And to excuse her own embarrassment by telling everyone you're autistic is horrid behaviour on her part. I recommend not doing any favours for her ever again, because if you don't do the favour to her liking, she'll throw a strop, throw you under the bus and sulk about it. She has a lot of nerve to try and make her bad communication your fault.", "NTA. Tracy is. Maybe trade Tracy in for Megan.", "Plenty of people don't do cake. I love cake but one year I asked my mom to make me a sweet potato casserole instead (her recipe has so much brown sugar it's probably sweeter).\n\nMost importantly your \"friend\" said dessert, not cake, and that doesn't read \"make the cake\" to me. It reads \"bring additional alternate sweets\" for the many no-cake people out there. I would assume that the *party organizer* would have had the actual important cake planned and/or paid for well before the event rather than try to dump it on an acquaintance of the guest of honor.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If she only wanted cake, she should have asked for cake instead of dessert. No one is a mind reader here. \n\nI also only think cake is a staple at children\u2019s birthday parties.

This isn't an autism thing. Nobody says \"dessert\" when they *mean* cake. This isn't on you for not simply knowing what she meant. This is on her for not asking for the correct thing, because if she wanted a cake, she should have said cake.  Hell, even if she had specified cake, lots of people love ice cream cake for birthday parties, and cupcakes are also a totally normal bday dessert too. Plus, if she knew the bday girl didn't like Brownies then she sure should have specified no brownies if she was going to be as vague as to simply say \"dessert\".\n\nIt is incredibly rude of her to have asked you for help prepping for a party for someone you're not even friends with and then shit talk you for your efforts.\n\nNTA", "NTA But you should have asked what type of desert or  your friend should have told you what they wanted you to make.\n\nHonestly after what your friend said about you at the party she wouldnt be my friend anymore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
