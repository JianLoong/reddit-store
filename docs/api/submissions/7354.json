My parents have some crazy rules but at this point my least favorite ones are \n1. No moving out until your engaged / married (avoiding shame) \n2. No marrying until your older sibling is married ( avoiding shame) \n3. It\u2019s also frowned upon for females to be unwed by 25\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m currently focused on my career. I\u2019m a software engineer at very well known tech company and they are unimpressed. Yes they are proud but would be more proud if I was married and had kids.  Don\u2019t see myself getting married let alone having kids in the foreseeable future. \n\nI have a sister 22 who wants to be married &  isn\u2019t  allowed until I\u2019m at least engaged, So she\u2019s been on me too. \n\nAbout 4 years ago I met Alex 28 at work. We immediately clicked being the only brown people at work. Over the years we became best of friends as he was one of the few people in our friend group who understood everything about me. Why I couldn\u2019t stay out late and all the other crazy rules my parents had (because his parents had the same ones, especially for his sisters) \n\nI think Alex has it worse though. He\u2019s gay & knows for sure he\u2019ll get disowned once he tells them. His folks have always been great to him which is why coming out scares him.  They\u2019ve been pressuring him to get married.  Alex is a catch, attractive, financially well off & has the kindest heart\u2026 so many aunties have been trying to get their daughters with him.  His parents often invite girls and their families to try to arrange a marriage and he has been rejecting it. \n\nThis past fall we watched the Movie Wedding Season and thought it was genius! If you haven\u2019t watched it, it\u2019s basically two south Asians who decided to pretend to be together to get their parents off their backs.  Alex suggested we do the same thing & I loved it lol \n\nHis plan is believable because we\u2019ve known each other for 4 years & always hang out. We\u2019re from the same community and everyone knows we work together. Our parents are supper happy & were pushing for an engagement. We agreed to it! \n\nWe plan on becoming roommates & moving out together come the end of this month. We found an amazing condo about 15 hour drive from our parents.  Because we can work remote & our company has a base in the state we both wanted to go to it worked out perfectly! \n\nThis will give me the opportunity to just focus on my career and not get pressured to settle & it also gives him the opportunity to comfortably be himself & date whatever guys he wants without his \u201cfamily finding out\u201d  \n\nWe are going LC with our families & plan on telling them the relationship didn\u2019t work out years down the line. \n\nMy best friend gets to leave a toxic environment & truly be himself, I get to focus on my career and my sister is planning her wedding with her now fiance!

Some people can't handle being cut off and get obsessed, start harassment and stalking. Those same people are often content with just superficial contact because it keeps up appearances. \n\nKnow that you probably like a year tops of living together before they want babies tho. \n\nI vote NTA. \n\nAlso, make sure you make friends where you're moving. Build that support system, it helps with cutting out toxicity imo.", "My first thought was to hope that once you go LC, you'll find yourself able to fully cut all contact. I now see why that isn't feasible. You're a good big sister.\n\nIf your plan gives you the confidence to escape as much as you can right now, DO IT. I understand you feel guilty, because your parents made sure to instill that in you. It's a way to ensure control and obedience.

I know I don't know you, but I'm proud of anyone able to do that.\n\nMy husband had to cut contact with his family, and I saw how much he struggled at first. He's told me he doesn't think he would've succeeded doing it on his own (he's doing amazing now btw). It's why I think you and Alex having each other for support is a brilliant decision.

This crosses every state line and its incredible how news can travel through sources you didn't even think about. Better not have your friend post something with a pride flag or a bf, and you don't let yourself be seen with another man online. Only share pictures with friends you 100% trust and urge them not to forward them. Also take care not to be on someone else's newsfeed. It can suck to be careful, but honestly, not posting anything is also really liberating", "NTA at all, I think it's the best decision possible in such a shitty situation. However, be careful who you tell you are just roommates and how you behave in public, as there will be big consequences if they find out.", "This really sounds like a plan that would work for all of you, save yourself and your friend from a lot of family drama and have your parents happy. I know that strong beliefs like from your parents are impossible to breach, and it is often even amplified by living \"in the diaspora\", as the one who left want to make sure that they \"don't forget their roots\" and in turn become even more strict than they would maybe be back in the home country.\n\nThe consequences of being totally honest would be a completely fall out with your parents, they would be unable to continue contact with you, would punish your sister and lose a lot of their social circle which could make them even more hostile. I doubt this is a valid option for you.\n\nAs long as you and your friend are on the same page, you enjoy being around each other and look forward to living together, I don't even see how much of a stretch it would be to label you being together. You are having a wonderful platonic relationship, this is honestly better than a lot of real marriages. So don't feel bad and don't even feel like being a liar, you are enjoying the relationship with your friend, and everyone is happy. :-)", "It's absolutely the best solution. Just want to emphasize, as others have, that it's critical to keep the real reason for your engagement to yourselves, & if you do eventually enter into a marriage w/Alex, sign a prenup so no matter what happens, either of you can exit the arrangement (relatively) easily & w/minimal financial risk.", "I know it won't last for forever, it's not about that, I'm saying they're going to get discovered before they want to, regardless of what their timeline is.\n\nThis story has been retold in movies and TV shows hundreds of times (OP mentioned that her friend got the idea from a movie) and in every variation it always gets blown up.\n\nThey can't prepare for every contingency.\n\nAll it takes for this house of cards to come tumbling down is a neighbor of OP's parents to be visiting her new town on an unrelated matter and see Alex kissing their new boyfriend in a Starbucks because they thought they were safe.\n\nI don't see how this story has a happy ending but I hope I'm wrong.", ">another part of me feels like I\u2019m being an AH to them\n\nEven if you are (which you aren't) it's not like they don't deserve it", "NTA.

Does wherever you live have a large enough community from your culture that maybe there is a safe person for you to ask about it? I assume it\u2019s a small community since you said you were one of 2 brown people in tech at your company, which is not normally the case where I am at in Silicon Valley. does your tech company have chat groups for certain groups as maybe get advise on how others were able to get their parents to come around to these western beliefs that girls don\u2019t have to marry by 25.", "Jeez. It seems as though everyone needs to take a step back from their delusion.\n\nDo what you want because it's your life and you get to choose. Stand your ground and be tough even if you don't feel tough.\n\nTell your sis to do the same and leave you alone as that's the only thing she can actually do.\n\nTell your parents to butt out and learn to accept reality as that's the only thing they can actually do.", "This sounds like a great solution for you both.\n\nYou've found a way to satisfy everyone.

NTA", "NTA You didn't create the situation(s) that require this subterfuge.    I don't know why parents like yours can barely adapt to new situations, so I don't want to heap blame on them.  But I know you are not hurting anybody this way, and you seem to be helping your friend and your younger sister as well as yourself. \n\nI wish you didn't have to be this way for you, but I think you're making the best of a tricky situation.", "NTA. Good luck. Hope it all works out.", "NTA but I feel incredibly sad that you both are forced to do this in order to live how you want.", "classic Lavender Marriage :) hope you two are happy!", "I know right - OP PLEASE don't trust ANYONE with this info!", "> Your culture might be the big asshole here.\n\nOP's experience doesn't speak for all South Asians. Reading through this, I've been mentally going through the dozens and dozens of South Asians in their mid-twenties I know from growing up, from college, from work, etc. Of them, I know all of one person who is choosing to live at home, and even then has asked about moving to my city if she gets a new job. \n\nNone of us get to unilaterally be the representative of our culture, and while OP's situation is very difficult, it's her situation. Not everyone's.", "NTA, however please have clear a documented \u201cprenuptial\u201d agreement with your friend with clear expectations and property divisions and responsibilities.  Have a clear avenue for either of you to leave the situation. Anytime money/ cohabitation occurs, there is a risk of disagreements and resentment.  If either of you happens to meet someone you prefer to have as a life partner, there can be unexpected complications.  Put a plan in place for this scenario. Be safe and good luck.", "Good luck! I hope you have a happy and productive future!", "This really sounds like a solid way out for both you and Alex, especially if your family is holding your sister's wedding hostage to yours. \n\nIt might be worth drawing up a prenup to make the \"divorce\" down the road easier - especially if he's got more money than you, you might legally end up being entitled to his money even if you don't want to be, and depending on where you are, judges may force changes in the divorce settlement if they feel that things aren't \"fair.\" (I know someone this happened to, but it really depends on local law and also on the judge.) A prenup seems like a way to make sure the law doesn't treat your marriage as more than it is. \n\nThat said, congrats on your engagement - however you got it, you're getting your freedom, as is your friend - and that's worth celebrating.", "There are inherent risks in any plan. You can\u2019t predict the future, but the fact that you and Alex are already friends and have a respectful relationship is a good start. That you both have a lot to lose by acting poorly makes it even less unlikely this will happen. \n\nBut you should both have a discussion about how you will handle the inevitable baby question that avoids placing too much blame on one of you. Get your stories straight from the start so you\u2019re in sync.", "I really hope this works out for you. While I think that faking a relationship is generally not  good idea it sounds like you're both being smart about it and your heart/motives are in the right place. NTA.", "Speak for yourself. Have multiple South Asian friends in multi-year engagements because that's what they want.", "some parents* no need to decide that OP's experience is the only experience that exists."]}
