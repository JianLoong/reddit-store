The wait was long to be seated and when the man came over the speaker he said he would seat us according to section color and table number so to wait for our table to be called. I then noticed a security guard was ushering a couple families in that hadn't been called. I went over to ask him why they got to go back first and he said those were people with health issues that required assistance being seated. I told him that I have a bad back and standing around waiting is hard for me too and he said that didn't qualify. \n\nThen they started calling every color but ours. I figured I'm smart enough to know what color to sit in so I went ahead and went back anyway and sure enough found our color and table. My family was still wandering around out in the lobby buying drinks and souvenirs. They eventually did call our section and my family came back but the server that was seating us was kind of rude about me already being there. I asked him what difference it makes and he said \"because there's a system for this and you're disrespecting other patrons. Please abide all our other rules.\" I said sure. \n\nThey served the food with no silverware. I asked the server for a fork and he said they don't have forks. That it's some gimmick about mideival times and eating with your hands. I asked if he could please find me a fork and he said they actually don't allow them because in the past people have thrown silverware at performers. So I didn't eat because I don't enjoy eating with my hands. \n\nThe show went on too long and was boring. There was one part where we were told to make lots of noise. I started banging my cups together and one of the performers shot me a death glare and told me to stop. I did but asked out loud why I had to stop making noise if nobody else did. A server came over and said banging dishes together scares the horses and that it had already been something we were asked not to do earlier when they talked to us all in the lobby. I didn't remember that announcement. My sister said it was announced but I'm sure it wasn't. \n\nWhen the bar girls came around for drink orders I tried to order a beer but the girl shook her head no and walked by me. That was it for me. I got up and walked out and went to a bar next door and got a beer and a burger and waited for my family to be done. \n\nMy sister got mad at me after and said I'd ruined the night for our mom. Our mom said it was fine but my dad and sister are both acting like I shot a dog. \n\nAITA?\n\nEditing to add eating a burger with hands is way different than eating a greasy roast chicken with hands.\n\nAnd im not a \"karen.\" I'm a man and a member of the USMC so I carry myself with a little more dignity than to eat greasy chicken with my hands.\n\nAlso adding my family had already made it not a family event when my dad refused to allow me to invite my girlfriend along.", "created_utc": 1671983531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv0k8k/aita_for_walking_out_of_family_dinner_because_of/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The next handful could\u2019ve arrived before you, or had reservations, or been smaller parties.  The staff was rightfully pissed when you seated yourself.  Don\u2019t do that.\n\nOkay, so they\u2019ve got this gimmick about not giving out forks.  Just roll with it for the family\u2019s sake.

Or did you stick it your family even more for no reason at all for not pitching into the bill?\n\nEven if you really wanted to stick it to the restaurant, walking out on your family was such a dick move.

They specifically and repeatedly tell you about the staggered group seating, as well as the no silverware rule.  \n\nIt\u2019s a very well oiled and organized machine, as it must be to do three dinner and show seatings per night.

You were rude first. \nThey probably didn't serve you beer because they thought any adult behaving like you were must be drunk.  Listen to your dad and sister.\n\nI'm curious, though.

The wait was long to be seated and when the man came over the speaker he said he would seat us according to section color and table number so to wait for our table to be called. I then noticed a security guard was ushering a couple families in that hadn't been called. I went over to ask him why they got to go back first and he said those were people with health issues that required assistance being seated. I told him that I have a bad back and standing around waiting is hard for me too and he said that didn't qualify. \n\nThen they started calling every color but ours. I figured I'm smart enough to know what color to sit in so I went ahead and went back anyway and sure enough found our color and table. My family was still wandering around out in the lobby buying drinks and souvenirs. They eventually did call our section and my family came back but the server that was seating us was kind of rude about me already being there. I asked him what difference it makes and he said \"because there's a system for this and you're disrespecting other patrons. Please abide all our other rules.\" I said sure. \n\nThey served the food with no silverware. I asked the server for a fork and he said they don't have forks. That it's some gimmick about mideival times and eating with your hands. I asked if he could please find me a fork and he said they actually don't allow them because in the past people have thrown silverware at performers. So I didn't eat because I don't enjoy eating with my hands. \n\nThe show went on too long and was boring. There was one part where we were told to make lots of noise. I started banging my cups together and one of the performers shot me a death glare and told me to stop. I did but asked out loud why I had to stop making noise if nobody else did. A server came over and said banging dishes together scares the horses and that it had already been something we were asked not to do earlier when they talked to us all in the lobby. I didn't remember that announcement. My sister said it was announced but I'm sure it wasn't. \n\nWhen the bar girls came around for drink orders I tried to order a beer but the girl shook her head no and walked by me. That was it for me. I got up and walked out and went to a bar next door and got a beer and a burger and waited for my family to be done. \n\nMy sister got mad at me after and said I'd ruined the night for our mom. Our mom said it was fine but my dad and sister are both acting like I shot a dog. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

YTA.", "Well then I'll go with YTA.  The staff were just doing their job with maintaining the theme, so I wouldn't really consider that \"bad service\". Also you complained about breaking a rule and getting corrected when you're the one who didn't listen to the rules? There's a point in time where you need to be accountable for your own actions. Please go apologize to your family for being disruptive.", "I saw that after. What a weird flex to be so mad at medieval times for being medieval times lol.", "So instead of stepping over the back of the bench you were sitting on you decided to....hop over the fucking table???? \n\nFuckin asshole jerk is what you are, more than the simple YTA.", "How did you hop over the table with your bad back? YTA", "You sound worse and worse with every comment.", "AH", "I know you're a marine but sir please go back to the ship you're stationed at. You're ruining the fun for your family.", "So you don\u2019t believe the announcements included details like don\u2019t bang tableware together as it scares the horses, but you probably weren\u2019t there to hear that part and then you also don\u2019t believe people stared at you hopping over the table because it was dark and you couldn\u2019t see them so it must not of happened? Wow, you really love to make up your own reality. Still a Richard.", "You sure love making a scene", "Okay, then I'm going with very very soft ESH, mostly for lacking communication. Your family made a poor decision  by not researching/communicating what it would be like and seeking consensus about going to such a unique experience-based place for Christmas Eve; your mom messed up for believing/saying you \"ruined\" the evening for her - her feelings of disappointment did not have to ruin the experience for her, so that's not anyone's fault; and you for lacking in communication skills in general and specifically communication about taking your leave and re-uniting. Sounds like everyone here was more concerned with their own experience than each other's experiences or connecting with each other. Sorry your evening sucked in general and I feel your discomfort about the back pain.", "Then huge YTA", "Thanks!", "I\u2019m also autistic! I\u2019m thinking some of my autistic friends and at least one of my kids would be hella overwhelmed by medieval times and not be chill about leaving there? I could see them jumping a table over it. Idk we all have different levels of tolerance is all I\u2019m saying. I mean it\u2019s still AH behavior to others if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.", "...you haven't been around many Marines have you.", "He did Google", "What if he didn\u2019t know? And what if his family didn\u2019t make sure that he\u2018s fine with it?", "And there is logic to the no silverware rule.  Forks didnt't exist until after the historic age the show is loosely based on.  Knives and spoons were tye only choices and they are not handing out knives to an audience of hundreds without some serious safety problems.", "And you couldn't just deal with it for your mom's sake.  Humans have eaten food without forks for a few thousand years and it isn't like the food they serve is difficult to pick up with your hands. Do you eat popcorn, watermelon, fried chicken only with a fork?  Cookies?  If you do, then eating with your fingers is something you have done and could have done in this instance. You were just looking for things to complain about from the start.\n\nPlus you don't know what they told you in the lobby because you went and seated yourself early.  Some of the instructions are given directly to each group by the person seating them at that time. Or you weren't listening which is likely.\n\nYou sound like a grumpy teen with attitude about even going there in the first place. That place is about the experience/show not the food/dinner. I get it isnt your thing but a lot of times in life you will find yourself in situations that are not \"your thing\" and you should just be polite and suck it up especially if you want to get ahead in the work world. \n\nYTA", "So you ruined your moms Christmas present why?", "So you ruined your mom\u2019s special outing? Mega AH for that.", "You should be so ashamed of ruining your mother\u2019s Christmas. I\u2019m sure she does a lot for you that you don\u2019t appreciate and you couldn\u2019t act like an adult and make it through a single meal. That\u2019s so sad.\n\nP.S. You should tell your Marine buddies how you acted, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be really impressed.", "So how fast were you drummed out of the corps for being unable to follow instructions?", "I wonder if he ate the burger with a fork and knife? /S", "A burger that he ate with his hands.", "*At least 19 years old*\n\nMedieval times is in Canada", "Can you read? I said roast.", "Roast chicken is hardly finger food, and plenty of people wouldn't want to get their hands greasy.\n\nOP is an asshole for a whole variety of reasons. \"OMG HE ATE A BURGER WITH HIS HANDS\" is such a stupid attempt at an argument when there's so many other valid examples of OP being a pompous prick.", "I have a bad back that makes it difficult to stand for more than a few minutes. But I could climb over a table. It's not like my back doesn't function. It's that standing puts pressure on the lower spine and causes a lot of pain. So standing and climbing over a table are apples and oranges as far as the back is concerned.", "It was the mom's Christmas present and something she had always wanted to do. Medevial times makes the no fork rule very, very clear. OP could have said \"no, sorry\" instead of acting like an entitled asshole and ruining the night.", "His mom was not the one saying he ruined anything (read towards end of post). He also admitted to already reading up about the experience before going.", "He already researched the place beforehand and staff heavily explain all rules which he didn\u2019t abide a single one.", "He says he looked the place up in his post, so he was aware that this wasn't a typical restaurant. He was rude to staff, refused to follow rules, and hopped over the table to leave. What did his family do wrong?", "So he ruined his moms Christmas just for funsies.", "He said in a comment he did know.", "He went to a bar & ate a burger. How does one eat a burger? With one\u2019s hands", "Just like the people from the time that is referenced by the name of the venue, he believes the universe revolves around them. Apparently a couple hours of not having fun is a steep price to pay to his mom's enjoyment.", "I mean, eating a burger with your hands doesn't mean you are okay with eating everything with your hands.\n\nThat's such a disingenuous point to criticise him on, when there's a million legitimate things which show him to be an asshole.", ">USMC\n\nMedieval Times is also in the US, and I doubt this US marine found himself in Canada for his family Christmas.\n\n$70USD is probably about right for the dinner price too.", "A distinction without a difference", "It\u2019s not hard to eat. Have you eaten there? I\u2019ve had greasier hamburgers. I agree that he\u2019s an AH for a whole lot of other things but the food there wasn\u2019t hard to eat.", "His mom was probably just trying to keep the peace.", "Well, then it\u2018s not my fault that I gave the wrong judgement. Tbh, the real assholes are the ones who post here and add important information later on \u2026 Gosh that dude sucks", "Oh damn I didn\u2019t know there was one there & I honestly had no idea what USMC stood for lol my bad", "I'd rather not easy greasy roast chicken with my hands, and the fact that this is something people are latching onto is pathetic.\n\nThis child went and seated himself, pissed off staff by ignoring rules, ruined the experience with his banging, and acted like a self-righteous prick the whole night but he's \"a man and part of the USMC\" so obviously he is fine (in his eyes). But the fact he ate a burger with his hands and not roast chicken is what people are trying to grasp onto?", "Haha you\u2019re good bud, I\u2019m always down for a good Reddit battle of investigative wits.  Have a happy holidays!", "There are quite a few in the US"]}
