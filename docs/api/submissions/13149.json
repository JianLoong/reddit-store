Ultimately this entire thing was your choice because you placed more importance on getting your IL\u2019s money than everything else. \n\nIf it\u2019s culturally expected to serve alcohol where you live and most or all of your guests enjoy a drink, then yeah it\u2019s probably a bit inhospitable or tacky to not serve it at your wedding. It\u2019s like not serving cake or dessert - no it\u2019s not required, but it\u2019s something everyone expects. \n\nAt the same time, your coworker was incredibly rude to basically just come out and state the only reason they came to your wedding was to be able to drink alcohol on your dime.

This sounds like a very badly planned wedding. If you had given people a heads up about what to expect you could have prevented the awful part where people left.

However, I don't think it's the biggest faux pas. \n\nI wouldn't leave if I was inadvertently at a dry wedding.

Now this is pretty specific to how it would affect me as your guest. \n\nI have bad anxiety in large crowds. Hell I don't like being in groups larger than 12. Add in noise and it's so much worse. I've never gotten particularly drunk at a wedding (wait, no there was one in my 20's...) but maintaining a light buzz makes a wedding an enjoyable memory for me, rather than a night of misery.  \n\nLetting me know it's a dry wedding let's me decide how I want to handle this. Is it an intimate wedding for someone who I care about? I'll be there, no problem. \n\nIs it a grand wedding for my wife's coworker? The kind of person who might sever our entire relationship if I say ONE thing he doesn't wanna hear? Well, that's a conversation my wife and I need to have before the event. If I'm there, I assure you, I have a flask of very nice scotch tucked inside my sportscoat. I'm not walking in carrying 2 fifths yelling \"Who wants to get LIT tonight!?\" I'm surreptitiously hitting it in the toilet stall. This way I can support my wife at event where she wants to be with me, but I'm not absolutely miserable the entire evening.  \n\nThe reason I'm going with YTA is because you took away my ability to decide how to handle that event.\n\nRegarding the second conflict, there's a reason why so many people hate Mormons.

Not because I won't, but because it's inconsiderate when thinking about your guests planning needs and it makes you a bad host. All these things influence the way in which I attend a wedding. If it involves alcohol, I need transportation and longer childcare (overnight usually). If it's dry, I can just drive myself and pick up my kids right after (which saves TONS of $$). I also would probably just send a gift if it was only an acquaintance if it was dry because weddings for people you don't know well are boring (let's be forreal).  You're adding extra expenses and planning to your guests night unnecessarily because you knew it wouldn't be well received.\n\nAlso, you can plan your wedding reception however you want, but you can't complain when people dip out early because your event is boring (and I've been to these super religious based events - they are NOT very fun due to so many stipulations) or misrepresented.", "Yta", "YTA.

At least they served other things to drink unlike the recent post where the bride decided they\u2019d just serve water because that\u2019s what she and her fianc\u00e9 mostly drink (because they\u2019re so healthy).

I honestly cannot imagine a wedding (or any big social gathering) without alcohol because it sounds so weird culturally speaking (to me.)\n\nI can and will go to dry (events in general) even when I drink, but as I mentioned before, never in my life I have been invited to one", "Lol coming from an Irish Catholic family a dry funeral is unheard of, yet alone a wedding", "Oh my God.

My in-laws have simply never done that; in fact, he and his wife live in a home my in-laws own, and they lived there together before getting married, too.\n\nThe only time my brother-in-law has ever been excluded because of being disfellowshipped is when my in-laws held a party at their home to celebrate our wedding for their friends from my wife's hometown who couldn't attend (she's from the US, we live and were married in Australia). They knew some of their friends from the congregation wouldn't come if my brother-in-law was there, so it was understood that he wouldn't be - but he'd been at the real wedding in Sydney as one of my groomsmen, so it was no skin off his nose.\n\nMy in-laws have literally never suggested to me, or to my wife as far as I know (and I'm pretty sure she'd have mentioned it!), that we join their religion or even come to a single meeting, in the 22 years we've known each other. They contributed to our wedding and put no conditions on it (not that a church wedding is really a thing for Witnesses, in the same way as other denominations). They've recently given us a very large amount of money for buying a house - not enough to buy what we want outright, but enough that our mortgage will be very small.\n\nIf you'd asked me before I fell in love with my wife whether I'd ever even date a woman whose parents were Witnesses, I'd have said there was no way - but there have been no real problems, so shows what I knew back then.", "Can you at least wear the dress again?", "Weddings aren't super fun.

If I had showed up to the wedding and found I couldn\u2019t order a drink, I\u2019d get a decaf soda (ha!) and then focus on what I think the reception is for - talking to people, catching up with folks I haven\u2019t seen in years, taking pictures. Why does that require alcohol.? I assume when I read this type of story that the people who leave early either didn\u2019t know anyone and so are primarily there to show face and enjoy food/drink or don\u2019t really care about the couple.", "This was a genuine comment.

They are expecting to be hosted in exchange for their attendance to your event. \n\nIt\u2019s customary to give not-cheap gifts at a wedding (especially one where the guest list is so long that coworkers are invited). It\u2019s also customary in American weddings (and hosted events in general) that there will be alcohol.  I\u2019d bet OP had mentioned how his fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents wanted a big event and paid for the whole thing which sounds to most people like a Huge Event. \nI imagine people would feel similarly being invited to a coworkers baby shower and getting there to be served cheetos and water. \n\n\nThey should not have said why they were leaving, but I don\u2019t really blame them for feeling like they were cheated into the rigamarole of getting put together for a big formal event honoring a coworkers relationship, buying the couple of gift, and realizing they were getting Mormon-ed. And they\u2019re right a lot less people would have RSVPd yes if they had been upfront on the invitation.

I don\u2019t even drive and live in a city similar to NYC and I am going to be pissed the fuck off spending \u00a370 on an Uber because I thought I needed one, didn\u2019t pack spare shoes to jump on a night bus.\n\nI\u2019m Irish but my family are Protestant and very anti alcohol. Proper temperance, hellfire, don\u2019t believe in dinosaurs stuff. I am used to dry events and here\u2019s the other reason I would be pissed off: the lack of alcohol is because of an excess of religious beliefs I don\u2019t share but that directly oppose me. I\u2019m a bisexual woman so same sex marriage and abortion rights matter to me personally. I have been baited and switched in this scenario to feeling unsafe.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the fact my family events were dry that is why I don\u2019t attend. It\u2019s because the same reason they have dry events are the reasons they think I am an abomination who insults God. They hate me to the point that even before I was out, simply having short hair was too queer adjacent and I was not given a warm welcome. I\u2019m also disabled and they like to tell me I defied God\u2019s plan by not dying as a kid. They hate that I have no children and no beliefs. I am estranged to the extent it took me 7 years to go back to the country for a holiday.\n\nIf your wedding is dry because you believe or have personal reasons, informing guests is etiquette for child care, travel and also letting them know if it might be scary if like me you bring your GF of 7 years.\n\nThe fact I can\u2019t have a good time without a drink really isn\u2019t relevant. I can, I frequently do but this is a signifier outside cultures it isn\u2019t the norm. I assume dry weddings for Muslim friends. I enquire of the person who invited about my GF as plus one.

That is shitty hosting and OP dragged his co-workers into it. Bad enough friends.

I'm mid 20s American and dry weddings are not really a common thing, my parents have never even been to a dry wedding, I went to one first lol. They aren't all ballrooms either, the last wedding I went to just had a cash bar, it was like 70 guests total and the wedding/reception were held at the same venue. I still think it's a bit inappropriate to not mention the wedding being dry since a lot of others like myself would typically assume it'd be there. Again, both are and can easily be listed on the invitations.", "According to a wedding survey, only 8-10% of weddings are dry. So it is definitely not the most common thing.", "That's the go-to reason for alcohol at weddings, lol.", "No... because water was unclean/unsafe to drink", "Agreed with all of this. As a New Yorker I think it\u2019s also important to point out that I\u2019ve always been told to give as much to cover my plate, which in NY is minimum $150-200. So it\u2019s expensive. On top of that its kinda assumed that weddings have alcohol. So OP really needed to include that on the invite.", "But the coworkers didn\u2019t **say** they were leaving. They were trying to quietly exit and were caught by the couple. The couple then **asked** them where they were going and why they were leaving. I guess the husband of the coworker could have just lied, but it\u2019s not like the coworkers were making a big show of leaving.", "Also, not to mention that some people have trauma related to religion and may not want to be \u201chave you met our lord and savior?\u201d-ed all night\u2026.", "I disagree that it\u2019s a requirement of hosting that alcohol be included. I\u2019ve been to dozens of dry weddings and it\u2019s never an assumed thing that they will have liquor at weddings. That could be a regional thing as op said the New York guests were the ones upset. But as far as I\u2019m concerned and people in my region are concerned the dinner is the only required part of hosting. As long as you are served food then you have been hosted at a wedding.", "This.", "I\u2019m gonna say this is a generalization because my family has dry events only not because of religious reasons. But because my fathers side of the family as well as a few of my siblings all have substance abuse issues. As a sign of solidarity no one even on my moms side drinks. Every event is dry and I don\u2019t think any of us specify that on invites to weddings or any other events. We\u2019ve never had any complaints. Not saying that your religious beliefs aren\u2019t valid but this is a lot of vitriol for something that isn\u2019t necessarily religious. I also don\u2019t live in an overly religious area (not Utah or Mormon centric) but lots of our local wedding venues (wedding barns etc) don\u2019t allow alcohol because of licensing and liability issues.", "I can enjoy a wedding with my family with 0 alcohol just fine. If I'm at a wedding where I know just the bride or groom, then alcohol is nice to have. I do have some social anxiety so a little booze helps me socialize and if everything else sticks, at least I get booze.", "I mean there are plenty of things I can enjoy myself at with no alcohol. Hanging out with friends, movies, cons, local flower festivals, etc.\nA coworker\u2019s (or worse, a spouse\u2019s coworker\u2019s) wedding full of judgy Mormons is not one of those things. That I would most definitely want at least a beer or two for.\n\nOP couldn\u2019t even stay civil with his In Laws for a whole month after they gave him thousands, probably tens of thousands of dollars. Of course his coworkers didn\u2019t want to stay there.", "Weddings aren\u2019t fun though lmao", "wow you're the first person to make this observation", "Weddings are not enjoyable for most guests. They are boring and take too damn long. I\u2019ve enjoyed one wedding I\u2019ve been to: Open bar and tons of food.", ">Plus, had it been mentioned on the invitation, maybe people could have brought their own booze\n\nPlease don't do that.  Alcohol brought in can really mess with a facility's liquor license.  People snuck booze into my cousin's wedding (it wasn't even dry, there was wine and beer) and it was a whole big thing her mom had to handle or the whole wedding was going to be yeeted.\n\nEdit for spelling", "Gotta drink the guilt away!", "I agree that a heads up would solve it. I would still absolutely show up, but with different expectations. \n\nI never show up at a wedding with high food expectations, so a heads up about a certain diet being catered to wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. I went to a wedding a while ago with a bride and groom that are clearly keto. It was so meat-centric, it was wild. I eat meat, but not a ton of it. It was not an issue. \n\nI think an issue would come from people not knowing ahead of time and maybe taking expensive and unnecessary Ubers, booking hotels, even just planning for a different evening. Not saying a bad evening, but just different. A vegan wedding doesn\u2019t change any plans, really.", "And this is why my bridesmaids got to choose the color (black, which I wanted anyway) and I let them pick their own, so now they have formal black dresses to wear again for other functions", "Because purple is the wrong colour for your skin tone? You hate the colour purple in general? It was a bad shade?", "Yeah, but it's generally quick. The reception generally lasts hours.", ">Why??\n\nThere was an AITA post about it a long time ago. The groom wanted Dwarf-Tossing and, somehow, the people who disagreed with it were not deemed assholes who were trying to push their beliefs onto someone else.", "Jesus turned water into wine, you don't think he could have made clean water to drink instead?", "I've been to a lot of weddings and have never heard of dry weddings outside of the internet, except for my Muslim friends' weddings for religious reasons. Even at every dinner invitation I've been to, alcohol is at least an option and for me a nice wine completes a good meal. \n\nSo I do understand that it is irritating when there is no alcohol, unless it arises from the circumstances like religion or it was explicitly mentioned. \n\nAs someone who doesn't like the hustle around weddings, I would honestly have to really like someone to get through all the wedding speeches, games, small talk and other wedding stuff without alcohol.", "Yeah, it might be regional. I\u2019ve been to several weddings and actually the majority of them were dry. Any taking place in a church, and a few that getting the license was a hassle and expense. I really only expect some kind of food. The only one I was really disappointed in, was because they only had veggie trays from the grocery store out with some bags of chips.", "Exactly! I\u2019m not looking to get blasted, but if I got a baby sitter, got all dressed up with my husband, and was planning to drink a lot of bubbly and dance and possibly even hit a bar after as a very rare occurrence, I\u2019d be pretty bummed to find out it was a dry wedding.", "I guess that depends on the local laws, though.", "Crazy.", "I\u2019m down for a dry wedding just don\u2019t expect me to dance. I will be honest if it\u2019s a dry wedding I would prefer daytime or brunch though because If I\u2019m not drinking and dancing I want to go to bed early \ud83d\ude02.", "Do you know of any other way? \ud83d\ude1c", "Happy cake day!\n\nIt did look good on me but was very obviously a bridesmaid dress. And not my only purple one. The wedding colors were purple and orange.", "There was?!?!\n\nI gotta go find that.\n\nThanks!", "Gottem", "Maybe.  I know there are different types and even some places where you're allowed to bring in your own.  The major issue though is with controlling who gets served.  It's hard to prevent minors getting alcohol if  you're not in control of distribution.", "Was it a nice orange or garish?"]}
