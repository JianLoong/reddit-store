Ultimately this entire thing was your choice because you placed more importance on getting your IL\u2019s money than everything else. \n\nIf it\u2019s culturally expected to serve alcohol where you live and most or all of your guests enjoy a drink, then yeah it\u2019s probably a bit inhospitable or tacky to not serve it at your wedding. It\u2019s like not serving cake or dessert - no it\u2019s not required, but it\u2019s something everyone expects. \n\nAt the same time, your coworker was incredibly rude to basically just come out and state the only reason they came to your wedding was to be able to drink alcohol on your dime.

This sounds like a very badly planned wedding. If you had given people a heads up about what to expect you could have prevented the awful part where people left.

However, I don't think it's the biggest faux pas. \n\nI wouldn't leave if I was inadvertently at a dry wedding.

Now this is pretty specific to how it would affect me as your guest. \n\nI have bad anxiety in large crowds. Hell I don't like being in groups larger than 12. Add in noise and it's so much worse. I've never gotten particularly drunk at a wedding (wait, no there was one in my 20's...) but maintaining a light buzz makes a wedding an enjoyable memory for me, rather than a night of misery.  \n\nLetting me know it's a dry wedding let's me decide how I want to handle this. Is it an intimate wedding for someone who I care about? I'll be there, no problem. \n\nIs it a grand wedding for my wife's coworker? The kind of person who might sever our entire relationship if I say ONE thing he doesn't wanna hear? Well, that's a conversation my wife and I need to have before the event. If I'm there, I assure you, I have a flask of very nice scotch tucked inside my sportscoat. I'm not walking in carrying 2 fifths yelling \"Who wants to get LIT tonight!?\" I'm surreptitiously hitting it in the toilet stall. This way I can support my wife at event where she wants to be with me, but I'm not absolutely miserable the entire evening.  \n\nThe reason I'm going with YTA is because you took away my ability to decide how to handle that event.\n\nRegarding the second conflict, there's a reason why so many people hate Mormons.

Not because I won't, but because it's inconsiderate when thinking about your guests planning needs and it makes you a bad host. All these things influence the way in which I attend a wedding. If it involves alcohol, I need transportation and longer childcare (overnight usually). If it's dry, I can just drive myself and pick up my kids right after (which saves TONS of $$). I also would probably just send a gift if it was only an acquaintance if it was dry because weddings for people you don't know well are boring (let's be forreal).  You're adding extra expenses and planning to your guests night unnecessarily because you knew it wouldn't be well received.\n\nAlso, you can plan your wedding reception however you want, but you can't complain when people dip out early because your event is boring (and I've been to these super religious based events - they are NOT very fun due to so many stipulations) or misrepresented.", "Yta", "YTA.

Especially when they judged you for other people leaving early. Sorry you had to deal with so much crap on your wedding, weddings are supposed to be a fun celebration!", "I feel bad for you having Mormon inlaws. Many are absolutely terrible and too focused on religion. However, ESH because you should have told people and people leaving early is part of a dry wedding.", "ESH. In so many ways. You took their money and accepted their conditions, the outcome is s on you, you were out of line if you didn\u2019t want the consequences then the answer is simple don\u2019t take their money, pay for your own wedding and serve whatever you want. \n\nFIL sucks because cult bullshit. \n\nCoworker\u2019s husband is just an asshole, don\u2019t concern yourself with the opinions of assholes. Also don\u2019t blame your coworker for her husband being an asshole. You other coworker was clearly coming to the defense of your coworker who was getting your ire for her husband being an asshole, that coworker sucks for white knighting.", "Yta cuz you\u2019re fuggin stupid. You didn\u2019t see any of this coming?", "They did go to the wedding to celebrate the couple.\n\nThe reception is for the guests and they bowed of that. \n\nAnd if they don't like the way they celebrate they should keep quiet but they aren't obliged to celebrate that way.", "honestly alcohol is a social lubricant and wedding receptions without it are a bore.", "[removed]", " I was not particularly thrilled but would have been even more angry If I'd paid for that hotel room", "I agree. Even something as simple as saying \u201cdinner, mock tails, and dancing to follow\u201d on your invite to note reception details could have prevented this. OP, it isn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t mention the wedding was dry but that you then handled the fallout so poorly that makes YTA here.", "Also, there are people who would go to a dry wedding but would make other arrangements knowing that critical info. If a wedding is 2 hours away and it's not dry, I'll get a hotel room. Having 1-3 drinks over a few hours + dancing will make me tired enough that I want a place to sleep nearby. If it's dry I might skip the cost of a room and leave on the earlier side (not earlier than the cake, though). I also probably won't dance as much. \n\nI'd be PISSED if I spent money on a hotel room for no reason. If the couple getting married is deliberately deceitful to their guests who are going out of their way and spending time and money to attend, then it feels like they are treating everyone like misbehaving children and starting things off on some kind of weird power trip. \n\nYou shouldn't treat your wedding guests like untrustworthy adversaries.", ">Your in-laws suck for imposing their beliefs on your day and saying they wouldn\u2019t even come to the wedding if it had alcohol (I am surprised nobody else focuses on this bit). \n\nIt's interesting, isn't it, that you'd absolutely want to impose your beliefs and refuse to attend a wedding that featured something you found morally unacceptable, without feeling like you \"suck\" for it. Yet, since you are fine with alcohol, you think the ILs should have kept their mouths shut and signed that cheque.", "Yes- was going to post the same, so interesting to read the different perspective now. I feel like  ESH.", "It's his wife's coworker. How much can we actually expect him to care about the actual reason for the gathering? In most cases, +1s go to the wedding for the food/party and not because of the couple. \n\n Weddings can be boring and the wedding of your wife's coworker where you don't know anyone can be especially bad. Many people don't like hanging out with mostly strangers or even find it unpleasant (e.g. social anxiety, introversion).", "100% truth.  There is outrage over a cash bar, the absolute scandal of a dry wedding would be talked about for years.", "The problem is most weddings are boring as shit and so the bar can sometimes make it suck less.", "Man, I am going to a wedding next month. $200 for a hotel, new dress for my wife, couple hundred for a wedding gift.\n\n\nSome free party.", "What about the people who has been responsible and  booked hotels so they wouldn't drive home drunk? They'll have wasted money which could have been avoided with just a few words on the invite.", "I don't mind a dry wedding. But if I'm not told it's dry I am going to arrange overnight child care and probably a hotel.\n\n\nIf I am out $300 because you decided to have a dry wedding and not tell me I am going to be salty about that.", "Around here a cash bar is an affront, I can\u2019t imagine the outrage over a dry wedding.", "I feel like I just had an epiphany.  I always thought I was unusual because I find weddings hard to endure from start to finish.  This thread is making me realize a large portion of people feel the same way, they just drink to make up for it.  Idk why I never realized this before.", "FIL said that these people were disrespectful and that part is true.", " Part of having a dry wedding is that people leave early. That was a choice you made.", "Bot account. Please downvote and report to spam, then harmful bots.", "As someone who carefully curated the alcohol selection at his own wedding, I do think it is sad when entire circles of friends or communities can't have fun without drinking. That's a substance dependency problem or a lack of imagination. Maybe both.", "I still find it surprising people not only consume, but expect to have alcohol at a wedding. I was an adult by the time I realized a 'dry' event of any kind wasn't to be expected. \n\nGot nothing against alcohol in itself, just not comfortable with it in public settings. Visiting a friend or staying home is one thing, but I grew up where any gathering meant not so much as beer is offered.", "The in laws didn't force OP to hide the fact that this would be a dry wedding, though. OP could have mentioned this on the invitation and all of this drama would have been avoided. \n\nOP wanted to have his cake and eat it too (without the company of his guests, of course, because they had left already).", "This. I once booked a 400 dollar a night hotel room because I expected the wedding to end at midnight. I was a bridesmaid. Another bridesmaid tipped me off that the wedding was gonna end at 10 so I canceled the room. It turned out to be an cash bar that we weren't even told about so obviously as a bridesmaid I had no money on me so couldn't even buy 1 drink. I was not particularly thrilled but would have been even more angry If I'd paid for that hotel room", "I couldn\u2019t care less if the in-laws signed that check but saying they wouldn\u2019t go from Utah to NY for the wedding of their daughter if there is alcohol at the wedding makes them the a-holes 100%.\n\nAlso, I have an issue with ppl imposing their beliefs on others irrespective whether I share those beliefs. You condemn alcohol? Don\u2019t drink it. You think homosexuality is a sin? Don\u2019t have sex with the same gender. You think premarital sex is a sin? Don\u2019t do it. But no matter what you believe, you don\u2019t get to dictate how others should live their life.", "It doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the ONLY way they try to impose their beliefs. And they need to come to terms that their daughter isn\u2019t in the religion anymore, and she married someone who\u2019s also isn\u2019t in the religion. They can have their views, but they either should except the daughter for who she is, or be content with losing her", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11y2nxu/aita_for_leaving_a_unadvertised_dry_wedding_and/jd5yii8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3", "no and I do not particularly like weddings.

I have anxiety about spending hours with a bunch of people I don\u2019t know.", "Definitely the case for me. Lubricates me through the social anxiety. One glass of champagne, 2/3 big glasses of Red Wine at the start of the reception and then I'm good to go for hours.

Because if not I am fascinated about this. You didn\u2019t encounter a gathering until adulthood that didn\u2019t have alcohol available?", "I am guessing you didn\u2019t grow up in NYC. It is fine if all your friends and family have this expectation but a lot of cultures have the opposite expectation. Where I live a dry wedding is unheard of. If someone tried doing what OP did he would have had zero guests within two hours or he would have had his own family being so embarrassed that they would have gone out and brought a truck full of booze right into the venue. Not because everyone is an alcoholic but because there are some social norms which you don\u2019t really get to change unilaterally, at least not without causing a lot of drama. If OP didn\u2019t want drama he should have put it on the invitation and let people make their own decisions.", "I think that you are the outlier here. Celebrations are the time when alcohol is expected more ... and drinking at home alone is more likely to be associated with alcoholism in general.", "He could\u2019ve mentioned it, but that doesn\u2019t mean the guest low key seem entitled. If not having alcohol keeps you from wanting be apart of your friend, or loved ones day, the problem isn\u2019t really the person who\u2019s having a dry wedding now is it? \n\nPersonally, I find the way he handled the coworkers was right. Like yeah, they could\u2019ve been upset, but they can\u2019t be mad that it\u2019s damaged the relationship", "Would you attend a wedding that featured Dwarf-Tossing as part of the entertainment?", "The gods of entitlement ...", "You\u2019re amazing! \ud83e\udd29", "True. The guests were tacky AF. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking it was more than the booze. It probably was a bunk ass party with no good music or vibes.", "You could find out by idk actually reading the whole thing \ud83d\ude44", "Nope, never learned alcohol was bad or forbidden it just wasn't a thing. Not quite an adult, was around 16 when went to family friend's wedding and they had a bottle of wine. Which yes was a surprise, first and last time remember seeing alcohol being offered at a gathering. \n\nThough it was a small wedding and pretty sure I was the youngest one there. Hence why I assumed the alcohol thing was an outlier, not the norm like I later learned.", "I've come to realize that! Just still find it strange as it's the exact opposite of how I grew up. Big family with a lot of children combined with a grandma who had trauma regarding alcohol meant celebrations were always alcohol free.", "Gracias! I love those darn automod posts! \ud83d\ude08", "Exactly,  it was all about money and it backfired.", "Did you read the words I posted?"]}
