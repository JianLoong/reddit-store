It's shitty to yell at them for a choice you made.\n It is in bad taste to not mention it is a dry wedding, as most people make special arrangements to be able to drink.

But yes, it is in poor taste not to mention it. Fair or not, people have come to have expectations of wedding receptions, and a big one of those is being able to cut loose and throw back a few adult beverages.

Well, sounds like you got all of those things, but you've alienated your coworkers and your in-laws in the process. I hope it was worth it, truly.\n\nETA: your FIL sounds like a real delight.

Ultimately this entire thing was your choice because you placed more importance on getting your IL\u2019s money than everything else. \n\nIf it\u2019s culturally expected to serve alcohol where you live and most or all of your guests enjoy a drink, then yeah it\u2019s probably a bit inhospitable or tacky to not serve it at your wedding. It\u2019s like not serving cake or dessert - no it\u2019s not required, but it\u2019s something everyone expects. \n\nAt the same time, your coworker was incredibly rude to basically just come out and state the only reason they came to your wedding was to be able to drink alcohol on your dime. Same for all the people who showed up and then left because they\u2019re apparently incapable of having a good time without alcohol. \n\nAnd of course your ILs are TAs for demanding that their beliefs dictate your lives too, and for being willing to skip their own daughters wedding over serving alcohol.", "ESH. \n\nIn-laws suck for their judgey attitude to people making choices about when they choose to leave a social occasion. \n\nCoworker\u2019s husband sucks for being more concerned about a lack of alcohol than the actual reason for gathering. \n\nOP sucks for: his attitude to his inlaws (\u201cHey, gimme all your money but I\u2019ll feel free to shit on you\u201d \u2014 did he never learn that everything you take from someone else is a string tying them to you?) and his confrontational attitude toward his coworkers. \n\nThe only person I wouldn\u2019t put in this category at this point is OP\u2019s wife, who seems saddled with a jerk of a husband and hidebound parents.", "ESH but it\u2019s mostly weddings that suck. This sounds like a very badly planned wedding. If you had given people a heads up about what to expect you could have prevented the awful part where people left.

However, I don't think it's the biggest faux pas. \n\nI wouldn't leave if I was inadvertently at a dry wedding.

Now this is pretty specific to how it would affect me as your guest. \n\nI have bad anxiety in large crowds. Hell I don't like being in groups larger than 12. Add in noise and it's so much worse. I've never gotten particularly drunk at a wedding (wait, no there was one in my 20's...) but maintaining a light buzz makes a wedding an enjoyable memory for me, rather than a night of misery.  \n\nLetting me know it's a dry wedding let's me decide how I want to handle this. Is it an intimate wedding for someone who I care about? I'll be there, no problem. \n\nIs it a grand wedding for my wife's coworker? The kind of person who might sever our entire relationship if I say ONE thing he doesn't wanna hear? Well, that's a conversation my wife and I need to have before the event. If I'm there, I assure you, I have a flask of very nice scotch tucked inside my sportscoat. I'm not walking in carrying 2 fifths yelling \"Who wants to get LIT tonight!?\" I'm surreptitiously hitting it in the toilet stall. This way I can support my wife at event where she wants to be with me, but I'm not absolutely miserable the entire evening.  \n\nThe reason I'm going with YTA is because you took away my ability to decide how to handle that event.\n\nRegarding the second conflict, there's a reason why so many people hate Mormons.

Not because I won't, but because it's inconsiderate when thinking about your guests planning needs and it makes you a bad host. All these things influence the way in which I attend a wedding. If it involves alcohol, I need transportation and longer childcare (overnight usually). If it's dry, I can just drive myself and pick up my kids right after (which saves TONS of $$). I also would probably just send a gift if it was only an acquaintance if it was dry because weddings for people you don't know well are boring (let's be forreal).  You're adding extra expenses and planning to your guests night unnecessarily because you knew it wouldn't be well received.\n\nAlso, you can plan your wedding reception however you want, but you can't complain when people dip out early because your event is boring (and I've been to these super religious based events - they are NOT very fun due to so many stipulations) or misrepresented.", "Yta", "YTA.

I agree, ESH, and here is YET ANOTHER  perfect illustration of why people should pay for their own weddings. You want a wedding that is authentic to your values? Pay for it yourself.

People had to walk through the reception area to get to the back where the ceremony was held.

It was fantastic and really kicked off what was an epic party/celebration. As I had moved across the country, the 95% of my personal invites/friends made it a destination wedding type thing (live in a popular city).

It has nothing to do with alcoholism. The respectful thing for guests who go out of their way to attend a wedding and reception is let them know you\u2019re not following the norm. No one expects a dry-wedding unless the bride and groom are sober or practice a religion that doesn\u2019t allow alcohol consumption. Guests like to enjoy themselves at the reception while celebrating the bride and groom, especially for many in a room full of strangers. You made such a wildly wrong assumption lmao.

I'm guessing that her half probably conforms to the same religious believes as her parents and so no alcohol didn't even make them blink an eye.

But the couple made a financial decision not to allow alcohol and didn't tell anyone, on purpose, because they knew half of their guests wouldn't come to a dry, religious ceremony. Deliberately misleading the guests, because you want their cash, is an AH move.
