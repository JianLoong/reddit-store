I have been working at the same handler since I was 16 (back then I was studying aviation I finished it and started another study). I have an ex bf 25M (Jake) whom I broke up with 1 month ago after dating him for 1 year. We broke up because I caught him cheating on me. I have been ignoring his texts and calls ever since.\n\nYesterday he was flying to Malaga. I knew he would fly there because we were supposed to go together. After we broke up I started studying harder and working harder. I had totally mixed up the dates and I was at work yesterday. I had 5 flights and I saw I was the gate agent of the Malaga. I tried to get someone else on it but there was not enough personnel. I went there together with another colleague who is also a gate agent. I saw my ex sitting there. I went to my desk when my flight officer came upstairs (Tim). Tim and I are close and people always say he is flirty with me. We talked a bit laughed and briefed the crew together. I did my job as usual and went labeling hand luggage before boarding when I felt someone's hand on my shoulder. I first thought it is just one of the rude passengers who will touch you trying to get a label for their hand luggage. I proceeded forward when I felt a hand grab my shoulder this time. I turned around and saw Jake. He tried to talk to me and said how sorry he was and he wasn't happy with his new gf. I told him that he needs to shut it and sit because I am not having this convo with him. He said \"is it because of that guy is he your new bf huh you forgot me that quickly?\". I told him again to shut it and my life is none of his business anymore especially not after he was the one who cheated on me.\n\nWe start boarding and at one point we were completely out of labels which meant we have to check in all remaining hand luggage. Jake was boarding as last and did not have a label. (I honestly didn't do it on purpose). At this point I had already checked in 32 HLUG I told him I had to check in the hand luggage. Jake tried to talk to me. The more I refused the more he insisted. He tried to hug me and started saying things like I am sorry I made just one mistake I promise I won't do it again just forgive me I'll leave her (his new gf) right away. I told him to proceed on board and turned around to close the lanes when he grabbed my arm. I tried to get loose but he held my arm very tight and started screaming and called me the B word. He even threw his suitcase at me and I yelled back cause it hurt and that is when Tim came running with his loader. They both took Jake away and told me to get him off the flight cause he is not flying with this airline ever again. Jake said that I ruined his vacation and upcoming vacations as well as he got blacklisted.

You have multiple witnesses and he sounds seriously unhinged.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like really you weren't the one who got him blacklisted. He grabbed you, made a scene, and it was witnessed by your co-workers. That's on him.  He could have just closed his mouth and boarded, but he didn't, after being told to do so.

Hopefully this shows you how large of a bullet you dodged by breaking up with him.  If he is so willing to leave the girl(that he cheated on you with) to get back with you, what's to stop him from doing the same to you if he meets someone else?  Once a cheater, always a cheater.", "NTA. Blacklisting isn't even enough for this AH. He grabbed you hard, verbally abused you and *threw a fucking suitcase at you*.

He doesn't seem to take much responsibility for his own actions but that's a him problem, not a you problem. NTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything but your job. He did this to himself. He had zero right to put his hands on you.", "NTA, alternate slow transport will give him ample time to cry about being blacklisted.\n\nThis is awesome though. Don't you even think for a second that you are AH here, he should have kept his wayward hands to himself.", "NTA of course. *You* didn't even kick him off the flight. How could this possibly be anything other than the right thing to do? You shouldn't be seriously questioning this. His behaviour was completely unhinged and you did nothing wrong.", "NTA Nope, that was awesome.", "he behaved like an idiot in the middle of an airport and he blames you for being kicked out from the flight and blacklisted?, does he ever take responsibility for his actions?\n\nNTA, he chose the worst time to try to talk to you about your past relationship and brought this upon himself.", "NTA\nJake assaulted you,  that's why he'd blacklisted and why he couldn't take his vacation.  This is his fault not yours.", "Nta! He blacklisted himself for his own actions. That is not on you. The world as we now know it has seriously opened my eyes to just how crazy people can be/are. It\u2019s actually quite sad. \n\nDo not feel guilty. His actions all around are his own fault. If he truly loved you he wouldn\u2019t have gone and cheated. Period. I would stay as far away from him as you can and avoid him whenever possible if you are out and about!", "OP questions for you\n\nIf another passenger you didn't know grabbed you or a colleague shouted like this and threw luggage at others in a violent manner would you feel guilty that they were not allowed to fly and were blacklisted because of their actions?\n\nThe fact that this person knew you does not justify them grabbing you, does not give them permission to shout at you in your place of work when you have told them you don't want to talk and does no give them permission to assault you or throw luggage at you.\n\nHe got himself removed from the flight due to his actions.\nHe got himself blacklisted because he assaulted someone who works for the airline and they chose not to tolerate someone abusing their staff.\n\nYou OP have no reason to feel guilty and it may be worth while getting a restraining order and use the video footage and flight ban records as proof to keep him away.\n\nYou are NTA He is", "He threw his suitcase!!  He physically hurt you!! \n\nNTA", "NTA. He did the whole thing all by himself..", "NTA. Look at this from your boss/employer's perspective: a passenger assaulted and sexually harassed one of their employees. If they *didn't* blacklist this guy, this incident could have blown up into a massive scandal and probably an accompanying lawsuit. Luckily, protecting you from this creep and throwing him off their planes is also the best way for them to shield themselves from liability.", "NTA\n\nThis jerk ASSAULTED you and you think you might be the AH??\n\nThis jerk is trying to make YOU the side piece and you think you might be the AH??\n\nThis jerk thinks that you talking to someone a month after he cheated on you with his current gf is a problem and you think you might be the AH??\n\nI will suggest some counseling to learn that you deserve so much better.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like it was really your choice. I don\u2019t know how throwing baggage at airport workers usually works, but I would think not very well.", "He got blacklisted from the airline because he assaulted one of its employees... if he had done that to any other employee, the result would likely have been the same.\n\nThe guy really doesn't understand the word \"no,\" does he? He cheated on you... discovered you were better than the girl he cheated with, and then tried to force you to take him back.\n\nNope.  You didn't get him kicked off the flight just because he touched you.  He got kicked for assault, and for that, he deserves no sympathy. NTA", "Nta. Lol \ud83d\ude02 he learned a good lesson!", "He blacklisted himself.\n\nNTA", "NTA for sure and the title was misleading, he didn't just touch you (like the first incident with him putting his hand on the shoulder). He assaulted you! He grabbed your arm and wouldn't let go when you tried to pull away, and threw his suitcase at you. Never mind the yelling and cursing.    \n\n\nY W B T A if you had let this go, this is totally unacceptable behavior whether a passenger knows you or not", "He is lucky they did not taser him and haul him off to prison.  The OP sounds like they are in the UK.  Just guessing here and I may be way off base.\n\nIn the US her Ex would be taken into federal custody for his antics.", "The blacklist happend by the Flight Officer calling Operational Control Centre of the airline requesting immediate blacklisting for the passenger. I had to give accord as well and I did. So me and Tim both kinda blacklisted him.", "He even threw his suitcase at me after I warned him to let go of me or he was going the get off the flight.", "exactly. he got himself blacklisted. what a gross, entitled ah.", "I think that is one of the things as well. I believe Jake got jealous of Tim because he is always a bit flirty with me. However that is still no excuse to behave like that towards anyone. And reading these comments I realize I feel nothing anymore about the whole situation or the break up or the cheating. Jake got what he deserved.", "This title was definitely misleading. It wasn't as if he just touched your shoulder like he did at first. He assaulted you with a suitcase and began screaming at you. I don't think any airline would (or should) stand for this behavior!", "Also a place highly vigilant towards _any_ unusual behaviour.", "He threw his suitcase at me. I have never seen this side of him before but then again why am I surprised I also would have never thought he would cheat on me. I wasn't really sad about the whole break up thing but now I feel nothing like I am totally ok with it. I am grateful I don't have to deal with him anymore.", "You still did nothing wrong.  There is no reason for him to be acting like that, and that behavior will bring a ban every time, whether it was you or someone else.", "They would have blacklisted anyone who attacked you like that. You wouldn't be second guessing yourself if it had been a stranger.", ">So me and Tim both kinda blacklisted him.\n\nwell yes because... he assaulted you at your place of work. dude. the guy CHUCKED LUGGAGE AT YOU - please stop thinking this is in any way your fault.", "Good Luck"]}
