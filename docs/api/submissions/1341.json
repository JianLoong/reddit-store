I asked my dad if I could have his mother's engagement ring, as it is of sentimental value. He agreed and gave it to me. It is an elegant princess cut engagement ring.\n\nLater, I was contacted by my sister to ask if I intend to have the ring resized. I said I will have to, because grandma had dainty hands, and my boyfriend doesn't. She said resizing can damage rings, but I will of course go to a reputable experienced jeweler that knows how to resize rings without damaging them. She wasn't convinced. She asked me to give her the ring and said she would split the cost with me of another one. However, I want to use this one because of the sentimental value.\n\nMy sister said a princess cut ring won't look good on a man's hand anyway, which I disagree with. I think a classy, elegant ring can look good on anyone. We went back and forth. She started to get emotional and begged me not to resize the ring, because if something happens to grandma's ring our dad will be devastated beyond belief. I'm not going to damage the ring!\n\nI'm starting to question my decision. Should I leave the ring as is and just buy a different one? I know rings can safely be resized, but her anxiety is starting to make me anxious.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sounds like your sister wishes she would have asked for the ring.", "NTA \n\nA ring can be resized without damage. It can also be remade to strengthen it. Your sister wants that ring and is making up stuff in order to get it from you. It's yours, given to you by your father. Her motivation isn't honest.", "NTA. She\u2019s likely mad that you asked and got it before she did. \nIt\u2019s now your property to do with as you choose and it sounds like it\u2019s going to a good cause as well.\nDoes she have a habit of wanting things that you\u2019ve gotten ahead of her?\nBe warned that if she gets the opportunity she will take/steal that ring and you will never see it again.", "NTA generally speaking, but you have some legwork to do. \n\n1. Talk to your bf before proposing. Make sure he is ready for this step. You don\u2019t have to ask permission to propose but get some clarity. Surprise proposals work great in the movies, not always in real life. \n\n2. Learn about his ring preferences. Find a way to determine if this is something he would like. \n\n3. Talk to more than one jeweler. Take the ring in, tel then the size you\u2019re trying to achieve and ask them if/how they would do it. Don\u2019t just trust that they know what they are doing, get them to tell you and if possible show you examples of similar jobs.  \n\n4. Figure out your plan B if the ring can\u2019t be resized as much as you need. Would you take out the stone and reuse it or will it be too small in a larger setting? Will you reuse the metal to make a new setting? What outcome can you live with and feel good about regardless of how sis feels?\n\n5. Does dad have an opinion here that you care about? If so, talk to him first. Not saying you have to get his permission but if you care about that find out before you do something undoable. \n\nGood luck!

Maybe one of you can keep the metal and the other one the diamond. This way you both can have your grandmother\u2019s ring. My husband proposed with a replica of his grandmother\u2019s ring- the original was given to one of his cousins as her inheritance. \n\nGood luck with the proposal!

A reputable jeweler should be honest with you regarding the ability to resize the ring in question. Go to a good jewler and get an opinion before acting further.", "I wouldnt do it!", "NTA. Sounds like your sister may want the ring herself as her argument is ridiculous.", "NTA \n\nTalk to a reputable jeweler and ask if they think the ring can be resized safely. Then, go ask several others the same question. If the consensus is an unequivocal unanimous opinion, all should be well.\n\nHowever, have you considered that your sister may also have a deep sentimental attachment to the ring? She may be projecting her feelings onto your dad. Is she married? Might she have wanted to wear the ring or pass it along to her daughter? It wouldn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have it, but it might explain her panicked calls.\n\nThere may not be a good answer with feelings so intwined in the decision. Whether you choose to use it or not, know that whatever ring you use for your marriage will have extreme sentimental value whether it only celebrates your new union (and others to come as you introduce a new ring) or also celebrates past members of your family if you use your grandma\u2019s ring.\n\nA lady I know gave the stone to one daughter and the antique setting to her other daughter. \n\nI hope you all have a happily ever after.", "NTA. It's your ring now, you can do whatever you want with it.", "Oh gosh! I have to say a very kind and gentle YTA here. I appreciate the sentiment but it seems like way too much risk. You don\u2019t know if it can be done, and from a woman with \u201cdainty hands\u201d to a man\u2019s size at that. You don\u2019t know if he would want or wear anything like that, and you would permanently distort the heirloom in the process. I\u2019m with your sister on this one, sorry! At a minimum, don\u2019t resize it before you propose. You can decide together, or do some thing special with the diamond.", "INFO: Have you checked to see if the ring can even be resized enough to fit your boyfriend? There is a limit to how much bigger or smaller a ring can be altered.", "NTA But your sister may have a point - I know nothing about resizing rings.  You should talk to a jeweler to find out about the resizing process and any risks involved. Once you have this information then talk to your dad.  Make sure he\u2019s comfortable with the alterations. To be clear he gave you the ring; you are not obligated to consult him. But it would be considerate as the ring has sentimental value to him as well. You should also talk to your fianc\u00e9. Ensure that he would like to wear a princess cut. It sounds like your sister is trying to impose gender expectations but your boyfriend might like something more traditionally masculine. But if he likes a princess cut then go for it. Also makes sure you boyfriend understands the sentimental value of the ring. Bringing someone into your family is a big deal. Giving them a piece of your family history is even more meaningful.  Lastly your sister may have always assumed that she would receive the ring at some point. That  may be a family conversation that needs to be had.", "It depends on the resizing. If there is a substantial size difference between your grandmother's ring size and your boyfriend's ring size, then YWBTA.\n\nThe reason is because while extremely wide rings can be resized up to 4 sizes larger, engagement rings which have a narrower band can only be resized up to 2 ring sizes larger without damaging and weakening the band. So, if your grandmother wore a size 5 ring, for example, your boyfriend's ring size would need to be no larger than a size 7.\n\nIf you are seriously invested in using the ring, take it to a fine jeweler (not a chain) for advice. He or she may have an alternative suggestion for you, though.", "NTA Honestly, even if you can't resize the ring, you can use the diamond in a new setting. Heck, depending on the setting and jewelry, they may be able to use both the diamond and the gold from the OG ring.\n\nOr you use the diamond and hold onto the gold. (my mom has a stash of gold jewelry that neither she, my sister or I want to wear specifically in case someone needs to get jewelry fixed or made larger and gold is expensive.)", "NTA.\n\nGo to a reputable jeweller for a consultation in order to get the realistic picture of resizing and the possible risks it might bring. Then decide if it's something you want to do. But also ask your bf if he wants to wear that ring or not, and consider the option of making a replica that would fit him without having to resize the original.\n\nI would've said N A H if your sister hadn't been sexist and said a princess cut ring wouldn't look good on a man. F that.", "NAH it either can or cant be done without damage. A jewler will let you know the risks, if any. \n\nDont borrow worry. Go together and ask a jewler. \n\nIf it is a solitaire with no details on the band it is probably fine.", "Good question", "I guess I can't be 100% sure. We've talked about our plans for the future and marriage. He said he definitely wants to have a \"traditional\" (as much as we realistically can) wedding with both our families present. Nitty gritty details like rings have yet to be discussed, but I think he would like it and appreciate the sentiment.", "Resized, no not ALL rings. Remade? Much more likely.", "I agree with this advice, but not the judgment.", "I have an appointment with the jeweler on Monday for the ring to be examined. Since the ring is gold and gold is a soft metal, he said he should be able to do it, but also said he can't promise anything until he physically examines the ring.", "Wearing a women's ring is a thing you should definitely check hes okay with first.", "You need to get to some of those details. What if the ring is changed forever and your partner doesn't want it then your sister will have a fraction of your grandma's ring. \n\nBeing an archivist I think old, sentimental things should be left to the original as possible. There comes a point if the only way you want to or can use it is to change it then that's one thing, but your sister wants it and sounds like she would use it as is. I think that would make you an ass.", "Engagements and engagement rings should not be a surprise.  Slow down just a bit and iron out the details with your boyfriend before you do anything.", "Hmm.  Traditional wedding practices wouldn't include a man wearing a woman's princess cut diamond ring, but that doesn't mean your boyfriend would be opposed. My suggestion is to ask him because if he doesn't like it then perhaps you can take your sis up on the offer since she seems to really value it.", ">he definitely wants to have a \"traditional\" (as much as we realistically can) wedding \n\nWhy is traditional in quotes, and what makes that more difficult for you?", "Considering it\u2019s an important family heirloom\u2026.\nIf jeweler says he can alter it, before altering, check with your boyfriend if he would like to wear an engagement ring. If he\u2019s on board, I\u2019d propose without altering it just yet, because what if he doesn\u2019t like that particular ring? If he doesn\u2019t, then you can use the money your sister offered towards a ring he would like more.", "Op doesn\u2019t specify gender but as a queer person I\u2019m getting the vibe that OP is not a woman, meaning the wedding will inherently be non-traditional.", "I agree, check with the boyfriend before you alter it.
