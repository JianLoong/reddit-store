She is my pride and joy and I love her. \n\n\nRecently my mother in law had to move in with us due to my father in law divorcing her and she couldn\u2019t live alone. \n\n\nRight off the bat she hated having Mjoll around. She calls her mean names, says she\u2019s ugly and rabies infested (very much not true, for a multitude of reasons) and has demanded I give her away or keep her outside. \n\nI have refused to do that as this is Mjolls home and I\u2019m the only mother she has ever known. I raised her from being very very little.\n\nMy husband tells me I need to compromise on this and make my in laws life easier as she is mourning the loss of her marriage. \n\nI understand it\u2019s a hard thing and I have an unusual pet but am I the asshole for not even considering compromising?\n\nEdit: i apologize Reddit here is your [possum tax](https://imgur.com/a/x0lQcDL)\n\n\n\nPlease stop saying how much you hate possums. Please stop saying they\u2019re ugly and disgusting and unloveable. She is my baby. People would be up in arms if you called a dog, cat, or baby ugly. My pet is no different. Fucking stop. It\u2019s unnecessary.\n\n\nFinal edit: my husband came across this post (not many people have possums and the photo confirmed it) and has said some unforgivable things so, guess I\u2019m a single possum mom now! Funny how quickly people show their true colors when you post online.\n\n\nFinal final final edit: hi everyone.

They look like and eat like a rat, and act like a cat. We live in the middle of nowhere, so we were able to let her bond and chill with us, fueled by our pity that she had no siblings to socialize with. She became an inside/outside opossum until she just slowly stopped coming around. \n\nAs a baby, she bonded to my then 6 year old and once she was big enough, she would spend her time on her shoulder or head, she'd make a sneeze sound in her warmer until one of us got her out. She grew out of the warmer and into a 3 story kitten cage, though she spent most waking hours outside of it with us, then we just opened the door to the cage so she could roam wherever she wanted as an adult. She eventually started spending her days somewhere outside and just coming in food food every night. Then every other night, then once a week, then every other week, then she stopped altogether. \n\nAs an adult, I would occasionally randomly find her sprawled out beside my sleeping daughter after she quietly came through the cat door. She was no longer cool with being held, but she liked to cuddle occasionally and stare at you judgementally if her plate of food wasn't placed down by the time she arrived.", "When I was ~8, I had a kitten that bonded with me unlike any pet we'd had up to then (our family had multiple family pets, also took care of strays, and notably, I did not find a bond like this again until I got a kitten at 29yo). We went everywhere together from the moment she was able to walk. She would cuddle in bed with me every night; her purring was my perfect lullaby. \nOne night, my dad walked by me asleep with her purring away in my arms, and decided she was too loud. He grabbed her and threw her outside. I screamed and cried next to the door, listening to her howling to come back inside. I begged my dad to let me get her and evem promised that I wouldn't let her sleep by me. I offered to give up anything and everything I could think of. But eventually my father made me go back to bed. I never heard or saw her again. That was it. It really broke my heart. I still felt the hole she left that night until I found another kitty that seemed to need me just as much as she did. He's still with me now, and honestly, if it wasn't for him, I could never have looked through all the pictures I took as a child of that kitten. It really broke me. Heck, it was so bad, multiple people that worked for my father quit when they learned what he'd done. \n\nOP, never let anyone come between you and your family (and I don't mean MIL).
