She eventually gave up when she could see it wasn\u2019t going to happen. She did some pretty nasty things that I won\u2019t get into here. She was also very disrespectful towards me, to a point where my boyfriend has asked his parents to warn him if Annie would be around for parties/get togethers because if she was, we wouldn\u2019t be going. \n\nI guess Annie moved on to FIL when it didn\u2019t work with my boyfriend, and she succeeded. FIL left MIL for Annie 5 years ago. She is the same age as me, FIL is almost 30 years my senior. \n\nMIL was obviously devastated to lose her husband of 30+ years just like that. She is the sweetest woman and I really felt for her. It didn\u2019t help that FIL didn\u2019t own up to his actions at the time. My boyfriend also talked to his dad about how Annie tried to make moves on him several times and asked his dad if he didn\u2019t think this whole thing was kind of weird and disrespectful of her to be doing. But FIL never saw a problem with anything that Annie did, and continued his relationship with her. \n\nOver the years, FIL has not been in touch with the family much. But my boyfriend still loves his dad, which I respect. So we of course extended an invitation to him for our wedding. But we both agree that Annie is not invited. I cannot just forget about the way she disrespected me personally, and disrespected my relationship with my boyfriend. I also don\u2019t want drama at our wedding, because I know that if MIL sees FIL and Annie there together, there will be some sort of drama. She\u2019s had a very hard time over the past few years being a single mom who was previously a stay at home mom for over 30 years, so I can kind of understand how she feels. The way I see it, my responsibility is to her feelings, and not to Annie\u2019s. \n\nMy SIL said we\u2019re taking this too far and should just get over all of this crap that happened over 5 years ago.

The people at your wedding should first and foremost respect the couple, which Annie obviously hasn\u2019t.", "NTA. SIL is nuts to think it is okay for someone who tried to break up you and your fiance to come to the wedding. Never mind she split up a married couple of 30 years. Tell FIL Annie is unwelcome, and will be thrown out if she shows up, along with him (and make sure you have designated \"bouncers\" to do so).", "NTA Annie sounds creepy and I am glad you are standling by your poor MIL.", "NTA. Why is it ALWAYS weddings that bring out the worst in humanity???  This is exactly the right call - invite his dad, excuse the AP. You would be causing massive harm to your MIL on a day that should be joyful for her. SIL can have her feelings on the situation, but five years isn\u2019t enough time to \u201cget over\u201d a betrayal of this magnitude.", "NTA Its yalls wedding and you have valid reasons for not wanting to include her. If dad doesn't want to come, that's on him, not on you.", "You can banish her as far away as you like on this one. She\u2019s gross, scheming, and manipulative. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want her witnessing my vows either knowing she thought so little of what they mean.\n\nNTA", "nta\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshe help break up a family, she doesn't need to be invited", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are well within your right to not want someone who tried to destroy your relationship to celebrate with you at your wedding.\n\nFIL can stay home if he won\u2019t come without her. It is none of SIL\u2019s business.", "NTA.  I'm not sure what your SIL is thinking, but inviting a woman who tried to break up the couple getting married AND broke up the groom's parents' marriage is batshit crazy.", "NTA The other option is not to invite FIL either.", "NTA. Annie is something else. I would not want her around me or my family.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want to invite FIL at all, but that\u2019s your fianc\u00e9\u2019s call.\n\nPerhaps he\u2019ll decline the invite anyway since Annie\u2019s not invited. I do think your fianc\u00e9 needs to spell out that he doesn\u2019t have a +1 so he doesn\u2019t just bring her anyway.", "No... It's very smart to exclude her. It's the right thing, the smart thing, the easy thing and it feels damn good.\n\nI hope you have a beautiful nuptials and a drama free life together", "NTA and if it was me fil wouldn\u2019t have gotten an invite in the first place", "NTA Annie sounds awful and if your FIL doesn't come because she isn't invited, well, awesome. Your SIL though, perhaps give her details about what happened between Annie and your partner before she moved on to FIL. If nothing else she'll know why you've made the decision you have, and hopefully, it will keep her from causing more drama down the line.", "NTA. Who wants a home wrecker at their wedding?", "NTA.

Especially if that negative history included them literally trying to snake the person I'm marrying lol. Nta. Gf made her bed and so did FIL, they can both lie in it.", "NTA SIL can butt out", "NTA.

Your fiance is in agreement, that Annie is not invited, he's the only one who has a say.", "Forgot about her sticking in nose in & having her say when it's not any of her business.", "They've been together 5 years. They're a social unit.
