She eventually gave up when she could see it wasn\u2019t going to happen. She did some pretty nasty things that I won\u2019t get into here. She was also very disrespectful towards me, to a point where my boyfriend has asked his parents to warn him if Annie would be around for parties/get togethers because if she was, we wouldn\u2019t be going. \n\nI guess Annie moved on to FIL when it didn\u2019t work with my boyfriend, and she succeeded. FIL left MIL for Annie 5 years ago. She is the same age as me, FIL is almost 30 years my senior. \n\nMIL was obviously devastated to lose her husband of 30+ years just like that. She is the sweetest woman and I really felt for her. It didn\u2019t help that FIL didn\u2019t own up to his actions at the time. My boyfriend also talked to his dad about how Annie tried to make moves on him several times and asked his dad if he didn\u2019t think this whole thing was kind of weird and disrespectful of her to be doing. But FIL never saw a problem with anything that Annie did, and continued his relationship with her. \n\nOver the years, FIL has not been in touch with the family much.

I cannot just forget about the way she disrespected me personally, and disrespected my relationship with my boyfriend. I also don\u2019t want drama at our wedding, because I know that if MIL sees FIL and Annie there together, there will be some sort of drama. She\u2019s had a very hard time over the past few years being a single mom who was previously a stay at home mom for over 30 years, so I can kind of understand how she feels. The way I see it, my responsibility is to her feelings, and not to Annie\u2019s. \n\nMy SIL said we\u2019re taking this too far and should just get over all of this crap that happened over 5 years ago.
