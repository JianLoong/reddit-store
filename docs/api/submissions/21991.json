I am big on birthdays so for my husbands I often go all out, and he also does a great job with my birthday most of the time. I do not expect the same level as I give because I know I do a lot.\r  \n\r  \nFor my husband's birthday this year I threw a big party for him. People flew in from other states and I got it catered and it was so fun. I also spent a LOT of money and time on it. I was planning it for months. I also got him a very nice gift that is something he will definitely use. He showed everyone at the party because it really was perfect lol.\r  \n\r  \nSo my birthday comes. I wake up and he's golfing. Then he gets home and tells me the plan for my birthday is to go to a bakery and a bookstore. I was starving so we got brunch first. Then we go the bookstore and I left my credit card at work so I had no money and asked if he'd get a book for me for my birthday and he originally said no, but eventually he relented. Then we go to the bakery and I got a coffee and a few treats. It was kind of a serve yourself type place, and every time I picked up an item he got annoyed about the cost and made a comment. It was NOT an expensive bakery. The average item cost $2-3 and I got 3 items lol. We also got a slice of cake to share. I went to the bathroom and got back and he had eaten most of the cake. The day was very nice but I was kinda sad about the lack of effort and then the constant complaining about the cost of things. (now is a good time to mention we don't struggle with money in the slightest).\r  \n\r  \nSo then he mentions my birthday present. I was very clear on what I wanted for my birthday -- tickets to my fav artist. And no, not Taylor Swift. I told him like 5 times. You could get very good seats for about $60-70 per person. So he tells me I'll get my gift on Friday and its an event and he wants to keep it a surprise. And Friday is the day of the concert so I got super excited expecting tickets.\r  \n\r  \nWell long story short, I find out my gift is attending a baseball game. I was immediately annoyed because I HATE baseball (sorry baseball fans). Everyone knows I hate baseball. And he also hates it! I would rather just not get a gift at all then pretend to enjoy sitting through a whole baseball game...\r  \n\r  \nSo WITBA if I told him I don't want my \"gift\"?", "created_utc": 1689129404, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xbh6n/wibta_if_i_reject_my_husbands_gift/", "score": 1064, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This falls under the rare category of not accepting a gift graciously, just because it is a gift. He clearly put almost no thought into your birthday, and certainly didn\u2019t do anything for you.

From your post he doesnt sound like he knows you or is interested in getting to know you. Pls think long and hard about his qualities, if the good outlays the bad and if you are happy with the dynamic of your relationship.  If this was a single incident on his part, than simply communicate your feelings on this to him in a calm and collected manner and make suggestions how to improve in the future or work on a solution together.

Like maybe he blew a chunk and didn't tell you.  But also wondering if there's red flag transactions. I hate to even bring that up, but if this is really far from his normal behavior.... It's just odd he took you to see baseball which you both hate. I agree with another comment that he probably got tickets for free.", "NTA\n\nCurious if you two are having money issues.

It feels like he\u2019s trying to give you a bday you don\u2019t want because that\u2019s what you did to him? Does he tend to be petty? I dunno that was weirdly my first thought. And even if he has gotten the tickets you want instead of baseball, why did he treat your actual birthday that way, that\u2019s what is weird to me.

My partner is *terrible* with planning and I like to put a lot of thought into my gifts be it expensive or not. Example, two years ago I baked a double chocolate cake from scratch with butter cream frosting, also from scratch and made the top of it a paleontology dig site with white chocolate fossils (this took me *hours*, he loves and collects fossils), I gathered all of his friends and threw him a BBQ pool party and ended it with tickets to his favorite comedian with his parents coming down to watch the kids for us. This took me months to plan.\n\nI'll get some tickets to a show I love and a box still in its Amazon packaging.\n\nHere's where we differ. His attitude.\n\n>this is NOT the norm at all.\n\nMy partner would take me out like this occasionally over any given weekend if I asked or even bring it up himself (rare but he would and has). He most definitely would never complain about spending $15  at my bakery or getting me a book *on my freakin birthday*.  Your lols seems like a front and almost like your trying to convince yourself that he's not a complete AH who treats you like garbage.\n\n>I mean, we had fun.\n\nYou sure? It seems like you *tried* to have fun and make the best of it and he just grumbled. Cause if my partner acted like that every time I put another pastry on the tray, sighing and complaining about the price I'd immediately lose my appetite and it'd likely ruin the day for me. Take me to a bookstore only to expect me to pay for my own book. Even if he did *finally* \"relent\" and buy one. Gee thanks. \n\nTell you what, I for one can assure you that this is not typical behavior from my partner (you claim the same). If my partner did this I'd seriously **seriously** think something was wrong and would wonder. Did he lose his job and not tell me? Is one of his loved ones very sick or pass and he didn't want to \"ruin\" my day? Did someone try to convince him I was cheating and that's why he's being so mean?\n\nWhen this is TRULY abnormal behavior this is where the mind jumps to because something this crazy HAD to of happen for them to act like this. \n\nAsk yourself again if this is really outside the norm for him. None of us here on reddit know the answer to that.\n\nI hope you see your worth OP and reflect on your relationship with him. I'm not telling you to leave him, but you DO deserve better, be it from him or someone else.\n\nEdit: grammar, spelling and a couple of words", "Tell him you absolutely do not want to go to the baseball game.
