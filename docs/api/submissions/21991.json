{"id": 21991, "submission_id": "14xbh6n", "title": "WIBTA if I reject my husbands \"gift\"?", "selftext": "My husband (28) and I (27F) have birthdays during the same week. I am big on birthdays so for my husbands I often go all out, and he also does a great job with my birthday most of the time. I do not expect the same level as I give because I know I do a lot.\n\nFor my husband's birthday this year I threw a big party for him. People flew in from other states and I got it catered and it was so fun. I also spent a LOT of money and time on it. I was planning it for months. I also got him a very nice gift that is something he will definitely use. He showed everyone at the party because it really was perfect lol.\n\nSo my birthday comes. I wake up and he's golfing. Then he gets home and tells me the plan for my birthday is to go to a bakery and a bookstore. I was starving so we got brunch first. Then we go the bookstore and I left my credit card at work so I had no money and asked if he'd get a book for me for my birthday and he originally said no, but eventually he relented. Then we go to the bakery and I got a coffee and a few treats. It was kind of a serve yourself type place, and every time I picked up an item he got annoyed about the cost and made a comment. It was NOT an expensive bakery. The average item cost $2-3 and I got 3 items lol. We also got a slice of cake to share. I went to the bathroom and got back and he had eaten most of the cake. The day was very nice but I was kinda sad about the lack of effort and then the constant complaining about the cost of things. (now is a good time to mention we don't struggle with money in the slightest).\n\nSo then he mentions my birthday present. I was very clear on what I wanted for my birthday -- tickets to my fav artist. And no, not Taylor Swift. I told him like 5 times. You could get very good seats for about $60-70 per person. So he tells me I'll get my gift on Friday and its an event and he wants to keep it a surprise. And Friday is the day of the concert so I got super excited expecting tickets.\n\nWell long story short, I find out my gift is attending a baseball game. I was immediately annoyed because I HATE baseball (sorry baseball fans). Everyone knows I hate baseball. And he also hates it! I would rather just not get a gift at all then pretend to enjoy sitting through a whole baseball game...\n\nSo WITBA if I told him I don't want my \"gift\"?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was not going to post an update, but my original post got a lot more comments than I anticipated so I am.\r  \n\r  \nFirst, a clarification -- My husband did not tell me the gift was a baseball game. He keeps a list of reminders and when I was cleaning I saw a reminder that said \"\\[my name\\]'s birthday gift - get tickets, baseball game.\" So I had ASSUMED it was a baseball game. Also, another thing I want to add is I absolutely LOVE surprises. Which is the reason everything surrounding my birthday was so hush hush because my husband knows I love the anticipation.\r  \n\r  \nAnyways, so he brings it up tonight and I finally ask if he will just tell me what the surprise is. And it was NOT a baseball game lol. Its an adventurous activity type gift that I have been wanting to do for forever. (I'm being purposefully vague because this is a throwaway). Think sky diving or bungee jumping. It also comes with dinner at my favorite restaurant. It's a VERY expensive date evening for us, as it'll cost over $1,000. And as much as I wanted to go to the concert, this tops it by 100. The reason the reminder mentioned baseball is because the activity doesn't run when there is a game.\r  \n\r  \nI also brought up my actual birthday, and he apologized for it. He told me he was so focused on planning the surprise and was treating that as my birthday celebration that he didn't realize that I wanted him to plan something for my actual birthday and scrambled and just picked out some of my favorite things to do. He also apologized for being very cost focused and explained that he was concerned because of the cost of the real gift. We don't struggle with money but we do have a budget we both make together and follow, and we also set limits for how much we spend on gifts and holidays.\r  \n\r  \nI'm sure a lot of people will still call him horrible and selfish, but it really was a bad case of him trying to plan a fun surprise for me and keeping it a surprise because he knows that's what I'd want and me making assumptions and not communicating, and him not communicating because of the surprise.

If this was a single incident on his part, than simply communicate your feelings on this to him in a calm and collected manner and make suggestions how to improve in the future or work on a solution together.

My partner is *terrible* with planning and I like to put a lot of thought into my gifts be it expensive or not. Example, two years ago I baked a double chocolate cake from scratch with butter cream frosting, also from scratch and made the top of it a paleontology dig site with white chocolate fossils (this took me *hours*, he loves and collects fossils), I gathered all of his friends and threw him a BBQ pool party and ended it with tickets to his favorite comedian with his parents coming down to watch the kids for us. This took me months to plan.\n\nI'll get some tickets to a show I love and a box still in its Amazon packaging.\n\nHere's where we differ. His attitude.\n\n>this is NOT the norm at all.\n\nMy partner would take me out like this occasionally over any given weekend if I asked or even bring it up himself (rare but he would and has). He most definitely would never complain about spending $15  at my bakery or getting me a book *on my freakin birthday*.  Your lols seems like a front and almost like your trying to convince yourself that he's not a complete AH who treats you like garbage.\n\n>I mean, we had fun.\n\nYou sure? It seems like you *tried* to have fun and make the best of it and he just grumbled.

Gee thanks. \n\nTell you what, I for one can assure you that this is not typical behavior from my partner (you claim the same). If my partner did this I'd seriously **seriously** think something was wrong and would wonder. Did he lose his job and not tell me? Is one of his loved ones very sick or pass and he didn't want to \"ruin\" my day?

If she doesnt like baseball and he KNOWS she doesnt like baseball, what kind of ignorant man is he to buy her a gift he KNOWS she wouldnt like?", "1. You married a guy you knew was cheap and expected him to act differently for you.  That is YOU having unrealistic expectations.  He's not going to change that for you and you need to decide whether to accept that or not.\n2. You told him what you wanted for your birthday and not only did he not get it but he got you something you both hate simply because it was free.  Girl, come on.  Why do I keep having to say this.  \"If someone SHOWS you who they are believe them the first time.\n\nOP you are not in a partnership.  DH obviously has a hang up about money and its starting to have a negative affect on your relationship.  IMO he doesn't feel the need to do more than the bare minimum for you and he balks at doing that.  I guarantee that's going to wear on this marriage over time.  You both already don't communicate well and I can clearly see this heading into resentment-arguing-separation territory.  \n\nSo my suggestion is for YOU to make a list of what your needs & expectations are for this marriage, deal breakers included.  It needs to be clear and concise and then have a sit down with your husband and ya'll hash things out.  Make a point of keeping emotions under control & no ultimatums until you've heard his needs & expectations and you both are on the same page.  Normally I'd suggest you do this while under the care of a couples therapist because they're best at facilitating this kind of thing and I especially think your husband needs this.  However, I have a feeling he won't be open to that....unless you get clear on your deal breakers.  But you aren't at the \"sick and tired of being sick and tired\" stage yet so this is gonna take a while.  We'll wait.", "You need to tell him what you told us. This was not a husband dropping the ball. This was contempt and hostility. And look at you rationalizing his behavior. You deserve better.", "Right??? Dude didn\u2019t even want to buy them a friggin book! NTA and dump him.", "I\u2019d still be angry even if it was a prank. Making your partner feel bad on their birthday is not a fun consensual prank. It\u2019s mean and it\u2019s hurtful, and at this point, even if he did get the concert tickets, I\u2019d still be mad at him if it were me.", "She stated she left her credit card at work so not a sole provider situation. She stated she asked him to buy the book because she didn't have her card so kind of sounds like seperate finances.", "When I was 10, my friend group all individually gave excuses to one of our friends about why we couldn't get together on her birthday. It was during the summer, so it was easy to say we were going out of town with family or other family were visiting, etc.\n\nThe plan was to throw a surprise party. One friend told her she would be around and they could hang out at her mom's place (had a pool).  We all went early to that friends house and decorated. Usually if we weren't able to celebrate one of our birthdays we always gave gifts ahead of time or decided on another day to hang out, but we hadn't this time bc it was supposed to be a surprise and being ten hadn't thought it through. When the bday girl came, we all hid, but when she came into view the first thing I noticed was how sad she looked. We all jumped out to surprise her and she really was, but she also burst into tears because she had thought we had all forgotten to even wish her and was hurt. We talked about it later in the day and figured out which ones of us hated surprises or what kind of surprises so that we could plan accordingly for the future. \n\nWe weren't particularly mature kids, but even at that age we understood what was important. I don't know how OPs husband can be so uncaring about his wife's feelings. I think OPs NTA, but she needs to talk to her husband honestly.", "She likes lavish events and lavish spending.

And they were great seats. No nose-bleed section.", "I wonder how they structure their finances. She \u201c. . . spent a LOT of money and time . . .\u201d on his birthday. Okay.\n\nMakes me wonder, though, if she also spends any time working and earning any of that money, or if what really happened was that he ended up paying for a big party for *himself*. Was it really even *his* party, or was his birthday just the excuse she used to throw a big party for herself? Does he even *like* big parties? Or, has there recently been a change in finances? Is she still, or continuing, to spend as though they can afford it and refusing to recognize current financial realities?\n\nJust don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting the whole story, here. Too big a gap between what she says is normal and *this*.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on here, but it\u2019s quite clear that communications between the two of them have completely broken down. I suspect there\u2019d be enough mud to go around if we had the full story. ESL", "Don\u2019t see any of that, feel free to illuminate.", "Being a social butterfly is what she enjoys. That party was more for her entertainment than his.", "I guess, but some people like to beat each other up. Doesn\u2019t make it healthy.", "What you\u2019re putting down in our conversation is opinions.  You don\u2019t say what part of what she says alludes to it.\n\nGotta give us some facts, or else you\u2019re making baseless accusations and it sounds more like you\u2019re upset about something you believe rather than what you read.", "What's brunch?", "And some people have a loving playful relationship.

If this is how it is for your birthday every year - I can't imagine looking forward to it with him.\n\nNext time for his birthday put the effort he put thi year into it.

I don't know why people think the whole \"I'll pretend I don't care about this person's special day until they're miserable and THEN I'll surprise them with a really great gift\" schtick is clever. All you're really doing is tainting something nice with something really unpleasant. It doesn't make the surprise gift any nicer.

Anyway, here's your gift ... tickets to an event that you absolutely don't want to go to (and neither do I but I have the tickets anyway, ha ha).\"\n\nI don't care if you have split finances, if you invite your wife to a bookstore for her birthday and then gripe about buying her a book when she legitimately forgot her credit card then you either have serious financial issues (which OP says they don't) or you're an asshole.

This is incredibly adorable and sweet and I'm glad to see it worked out.

My guess what that it was two reminders of some sort compiled into one or something silly. The actual birthday event makes a little more sense with the update, and while what he did was wrong, he owned up to it and made up for it in his event plan. (Though, I think there is no excuse for the golfing on your birthday. I broke up with my ex because he wanted to play golf instead of being with me on a day that was important to me\u2026 it seems golfing on inappropriate days is a requirement lol)\n\nHopefully he learns next year and helps it go smoothly! This is just a bunch of miscommunication really, and it\u2019s good you talked it out! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better about the situation <3", "After reading your update, you sound like drama and a headache. \u201cI do all these amazing things and I was snooping in his reminders and assumed he was taking me to something I hated and complained on Reddit about it!\u201d Let the man give you the gift before blasting him. \n\nAlso, your birthdays are the SAME WEEK, throw a joint party instead of lavishly celebrating him and them waiting (expecting?) him to disappoint you.

Not to mention $3 for a pastry. \n\nHe\u2019s backtracking because you called him out and he planned all this after the fact.

I am glad I never expressed any of this to him but we probably would have ended up laughing about it.", "thanks for the judgment!!

Plus she said she found it cleaning, not snooping. She never said she was expecting disappointment either. She literally said he normally does a great job. And it\u2019s Reddit, it\u2019s anonymous so who cares? You sound like a migraine, not just a headache.", "Thanks for the input! People have been kind of mean since my update lol. I've gotten very mean private messages. I do want to clarify though that I didn't call him out at all. The reason it was brought up tonight is because he was asking if I wanted to do it on Friday because the weather may not be great for it, so I asked him what it was so I could decide. And then when I found out what it was I said we should do it a different weekend and wait for the weather to be better. Then he apologized for my birthday day without any prompting from me.", "Girl haha I was so ready to be mad for you! That makes more sense, I was so confused as to why in the world he would go out like that on your birthday!! Sounds like he tried to go early to plan around it, which is good, just didn\u2019t go as planned is all.

He chose the bakery, it was his idea. So why go there and then moan about the price of not even ten bucks for three items? If he was tight on money - even though he afforded his Golf morning - then he should have spent making brunch at home, all cozy, but cheaper. Or not bother at all.\nMaybe OP picked an expensive book, but then again, he could have set a budget or not go at all. It was his idea to go to the book place.", "If your moms knows and is excited, and he has never let you down before why are you questioning it??

I wish people were updated when OP edits their post. This was a huge case of jumping to conclusions. Husband is clearly NTA.", "This why people on reddit should never give relationship advice.
