I am big on birthdays so for my husbands I often go all out, and he also does a great job with my birthday most of the time. I do not expect the same level as I give because I know I do a lot.\r  \n\r  \nFor my husband's birthday this year I threw a big party for him. People flew in from other states and I got it catered and it was so fun. I also spent a LOT of money and time on it. I was planning it for months. I also got him a very nice gift that is something he will definitely use. He showed everyone at the party because it really was perfect lol.\r  \n\r  \nSo my birthday comes. I wake up and he's golfing. Then he gets home and tells me the plan for my birthday is to go to a bakery and a bookstore. I was starving so we got brunch first. Then we go the bookstore and I left my credit card at work so I had no money and asked if he'd get a book for me for my birthday and he originally said no, but eventually he relented. Then we go to the bakery and I got a coffee and a few treats. It was kind of a serve yourself type place, and every time I picked up an item he got annoyed about the cost and made a comment. It was NOT an expensive bakery. The average item cost $2-3 and I got 3 items lol. We also got a slice of cake to share. I went to the bathroom and got back and he had eaten most of the cake. The day was very nice but I was kinda sad about the lack of effort and then the constant complaining about the cost of things. (now is a good time to mention we don't struggle with money in the slightest).\r  \n\r  \nSo then he mentions my birthday present. I was very clear on what I wanted for my birthday -- tickets to my fav artist. And no, not Taylor Swift. I told him like 5 times. You could get very good seats for about $60-70 per person. So he tells me I'll get my gift on Friday and its an event and he wants to keep it a surprise. And Friday is the day of the concert so I got super excited expecting tickets.\r  \n\r  \nWell long story short, I find out my gift is attending a baseball game. I was immediately annoyed because I HATE baseball (sorry baseball fans). Everyone knows I hate baseball. And he also hates it! I would rather just not get a gift at all then pretend to enjoy sitting through a whole baseball game...\r  \n\r  \nSo WITBA if I told him I don't want my \"gift\"?", "created_utc": 1689129404, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xbh6n/wibta_if_i_reject_my_husbands_gift/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if it wasn\u2019t your birthday, that\u2019s shit behavior on his part. It seems like he\u2019s not that into you.", "NTA.

And complaining about the bakery\u2026 is he always so damn cheap?!", "NTA, but seriously why are you married to someone who treats you this way?", "NTA. This falls under the rare category of not accepting a gift graciously, just because it is a gift. He clearly put almost no thought into your birthday, and certainly didn\u2019t do anything for you. If an acquaintance or older relative get you a bad gift, you just graciously accept. Your husband honestly needs to know this isn\u2019t acceptable and how it hurts your feelings.", "This is what your future looks like. Or worse.

If he really is perfect otherwise (which I doubt) and just doesn't care about birthdays at all, you can make it work by from now on each of you gets to plan his own birthday and on party. Honestly Op, if you want a party like the one you threw for him, do it yourself! Dont wait for anyone around to make you happy like that, sometimes it's better to just take the wheel into your own hands!\n\nNow to the husband problem you might be having, is this the norm of how he treats you? From your post he doesnt sound like he knows you or is interested in getting to know you. Pls think long and hard about his qualities, if the good outlays the bad and if you are happy with the dynamic of your relationship.  If this was a single incident on his part, than simply communicate your feelings on this to him in a calm and collected manner and make suggestions how to improve in the future or work on a solution together. If this happens on a regular basis you should leave. Relationships are give and take on both ends! Not you give and he takes.  Good luck Op. ^^", "NTA\n\nThis is the sort of thing that would have me rethinking my marriage. That being said, I think you need to sit down (alone) and do some thinking about the amount of effort you put in... and the lack of return on emotional investment. \n\nIf he is not going to put in effort, then start putting that energy towards yourself. He cannot have it both ways. \n\nI am not a big birthday person. I make my own plans, I buy my own gifts, and if someone gets me something YAY.

But I'm also a huge crier lol!  I was wondering, do you have a joint account?  If so, do you see any strange transactions on there?  If not, I'm wondering if HE'S been as good with money as you have. Like maybe he blew a chunk and didn't tell you.  But also wondering if there's red flag transactions. I hate to even bring that up, but if this is really far from his normal behavior.... It's just odd he took you to see baseball which you both hate. I agree with another comment that he probably got tickets for free.", "NTA\n\nCurious if you two are having money issues. You spend a lot on his b-day and now he is very concerned about the cost of pastries. And the baseball game, something you both dislike - smells like someone gave him free tickets.", "I am seriously hoping that the baseball game is ALSO a ruse and he really did buy you tickets to the concert after all.  The face I'm pulling right now is a sad one, though.  NTA!  He flaked on you!", "Does he maybe not like what you get him for his birthday, like the big party, since he obviously loved the present? It feels like he\u2019s trying to give you a bday you don\u2019t want because that\u2019s what you did to him? Does he tend to be petty? I dunno that was weirdly my first thought. And even if he has gotten the tickets you want instead of baseball, why did he treat your actual birthday that way, that\u2019s what is weird to me. It doesn\u2019t sound like some magical surprise waiting to happening, you know? I hope it does turn out okay but I\u2019d still question the actual birthday.", " NTA and it sounds like he was purposely pissing you off.", "He is selfish and self centered and this is your future. As women we give men \u201cpasses\u201d we often do not require the same level of effort from them as we put in ourselves. I have no idea why we do this, but we dig ourselves a hole of future disappointment we can never climb out of. Sit him down, tell him it is nit ok, tell him exactly why, include all the money whining and tell him he needs to redo the entire day and get it right. If you do not this will be your future- disappointment . I know I have lived this.", "NTA - it\u2019s reasonable to be upset when you ask for something specifically and it ends up being something out of left field. I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to say \u201chey I\u2019m a little confused. Not to sound ungrateful, but neither of us are baseball fans, so I\u2019m wondering where the idea for baseball tickets came from, it isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve enjoyed before\u201d", "NTA\nI\u2019m sorry but what\u2019s your husbands problem? It\u2019s almost like he went above and beyond to the very *least* for you smh I\u2019m so sorry OP", "That's a tough one! On the one hand, you put a lot of effort into his birthday and it would be nice to receive a gift that you actually want. On the other hand, it's his birthday and he may have gone out of his way to get you something he thought you'd enjoy. It's a tricky situation, but if you explain to him that you appreciate the thought but it's not something you'd enjoy, he may understand.", "YTA for hating baseball\n\nHaha", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Regardless of your gift, the way he treated you on your birthday was at best dismissive, but more just plain rude.\n\nGolf: Okay, fine, but come back with some breakfast for you.Bakery: Cute! A nice way to have a fancy piece of birthday cake without buying a whole cake. Maybe bring a candle and sing the song or whatever.Book store: '\"Pick any book you want!

Ok, he took you to brunch without incident, but he then took you to a bookstore where he was reluctant to even buy you a book, to a bakery where he seemed upset that you wanted a couple items totaling $12, and to top it off, he not only ignored your request to tickets for a concert you were dying to go to, but he instead bought you tickets to something he MUST know you don't even care about.  Meanwhile, you put in tons of effort into planning his birthday, surrounding him with people he loves, and getting him something thoughtful.  The effort is so clearly one-sided.", "He also hates baseball. Like we went to baseball 3 years ago and both agreed we hated it and wouldn't go back. It's one of the reasons I find it so odd. \n\nAnd I will also say usually he does WAY better. I swear the bar is not this low lol. I do agree this year I deserved better. Thanks for your input.", "On point! He\u2019s whining about buying a book and some pastries???? That should be a given on any day, let alone on her birthday. He sounds like an ass.", "Exactly where my head went. He is probably counting on her not wanting to go and he already has a buddy lined up.", "I have no idea what this means lol.", "That was a good one", "Honestly, yeah. It's very annoying but it has benefited us a lot. I just thought on my birthday he'd chill for a second because he usually does not go cheap on gifts.", "Combine both and he went to a friend of a friend in a back alley to scalp cheap tickets to the concert and got baited and switched to the baseball and had to go with it.  \u201cYou said tickets to see Chicago!\u201d", "I definitely did not want or expect a party!! And this is NOT the norm at all. That's probably why I am so disappointed. The last gift he gave me was a romantic trip away which we had SO much fun on. The one before that he took me to an art exhibit I had been wanting to go to for a while, a great lunch, and then an entire day boating (my favorite). \n\nHe took me to the specific bakery because I've been saying for a while that I wanted to go. And the bookstore is definitely something I love. But it was still very much eh. I mean, we had fun. But still. The gift is what I'm most annoyed about because neither of us like baseball.", "Op mentioned in the post that they aren't struggling, so that shouldn't be the case.

We both make over 6 figures in a very low cost of living area and have about $100,000 in savings. We don't have kids or anything and we live in a tiny house that we love and can afford on one of our salaries. We're going on a two-week european trip in a few months and he just suggested today that we extend it another week because he knows how badly I want to go to a certain country but couldn't with the original plan.\n\nI also don't think he bought the tickets yet. He told me that he will probably be moving the date of the \"surprise\" because it's supposed to rain Friday and he wants the weather to be nice for it.", "Hey I said sorry baseball fans in my post! lol", "Did he get free baseball tickets from work or something?? That is the only reasonable explanation. \n\nSorry your husband put in a negative amount of effort for your special day.

It's what homer did to Marge and I believe she didn't like bowling when he gave it to her", "I really hope it's a ruse. Regardless, why don't you buy the tickets? I'm not a big b-day birthday person, or any other holiday. We plan our vacations, events without being tied to a holiday.

I didn't understand why the wives didn't just buy the clothes themselves.", "Are his parents frugal? Just wondering if maybe he grew up seeing it and so he penny pinches even if he doesnt have to or shouldnt", "You\u2019re missing the elephant in the room: your husband showed you zero care or respect on a day you care a lot about. Time to have a heart-to-heart about your relationship, and whether it should continue.", "Is it possible he got you the tickets you really wanted and is trying to actually surprise you?", "Lol, I absolutely would have but I originally thought he bought them of course so I didn't. And I would now but my mom wants to take us out to dinner to celebrate our birthdays the same day and has made reservations, and I dont want to bail on her.", "He grew up poor and his parents were very transparent to him on all money issues, including filing for bankruptcy and almost losing their house. It honestly seemed to traumatize him. He used to be even more frugal, but it has gotten better and he continues to work on  it.", "That is what I am still hoping, but I'm not sure. If he does I'll update everyone about how terrible I feel hahaha.", "Tell Mom you\u2019re seeing the concert.  Maybe ask her to join you.  She can change the reservation", "Oh, I hope you rethink going to the concert if it means much to you. Good luck with all of this! Eat cake!", "I will say another reason why I thought it was the concert was because my best friend was in town a couple days before my birthday and mentioned that the singer would be in the city and I have no clue why or how he would notice because he doesn't like the singer and also lives 800 miles away. My mom also knows what the \"surprise\" is and seems excited about it???", "I hope for you marriage's sake that he has something else planned. As soon as I got to the baseball part, I was like, is he trying to send her a message that the marriage is over? I don't blame you for being disappointed op."]}
