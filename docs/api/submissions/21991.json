I do not expect the same level as I give because I know I do a lot.\r  \n\r  \nFor my husband's birthday this year I threw a big party for him. People flew in from other states and I got it catered and it was so fun. I also spent a LOT of money and time on it. I was planning it for months. I also got him a very nice gift that is something he will definitely use. He showed everyone at the party because it really was perfect lol.\r  \n\r  \nSo my birthday comes. I wake up and he's golfing. Then he gets home and tells me the plan for my birthday is to go to a bakery and a bookstore. I was starving so we got brunch first. Then we go the bookstore and I left my credit card at work so I had no money and asked if he'd get a book for me for my birthday and he originally said no, but eventually he relented. Then we go to the bakery and I got a coffee and a few treats. It was kind of a serve yourself type place, and every time I picked up an item he got annoyed about the cost and made a comment. It was NOT an expensive bakery. The average item cost $2-3 and I got 3 items lol. We also got a slice of cake to share. I went to the bathroom and got back and he had eaten most of the cake. The day was very nice but I was kinda sad about the lack of effort and then the constant complaining about the cost of things. (now is a good time to mention we don't struggle with money in the slightest).\r  \n\r  \nSo then he mentions my birthday present. I was very clear on what I wanted for my birthday -- tickets to my fav artist. And no, not Taylor Swift. I told him like 5 times. You could get very good seats for about $60-70 per person. So he tells me I'll get my gift on Friday and its an event and he wants to keep it a surprise. And Friday is the day of the concert so I got super excited expecting tickets.\r  \n\r  \nWell long story short, I find out my gift is attending a baseball game. I was immediately annoyed because I HATE baseball (sorry baseball fans). Everyone knows I hate baseball. And he also hates it!

This falls under the rare category of not accepting a gift graciously, just because it is a gift. He clearly put almost no thought into your birthday, and certainly didn\u2019t do anything for you.

From your post he doesnt sound like he knows you or is interested in getting to know you. Pls think long and hard about his qualities, if the good outlays the bad and if you are happy with the dynamic of your relationship.  If this was a single incident on his part, than simply communicate your feelings on this to him in a calm and collected manner and make suggestions how to improve in the future or work on a solution together.

Like maybe he blew a chunk and didn't tell you.  But also wondering if there's red flag transactions. I hate to even bring that up, but if this is really far from his normal behavior.... It's just odd he took you to see baseball which you both hate. I agree with another comment that he probably got tickets for free.", "NTA\n\nCurious if you two are having money issues.

It feels like he\u2019s trying to give you a bday you don\u2019t want because that\u2019s what you did to him? Does he tend to be petty? I dunno that was weirdly my first thought. And even if he has gotten the tickets you want instead of baseball, why did he treat your actual birthday that way, that\u2019s what is weird to me.

My partner is *terrible* with planning and I like to put a lot of thought into my gifts be it expensive or not. Example, two years ago I baked a double chocolate cake from scratch with butter cream frosting, also from scratch and made the top of it a paleontology dig site with white chocolate fossils (this took me *hours*, he loves and collects fossils), I gathered all of his friends and threw him a BBQ pool party and ended it with tickets to his favorite comedian with his parents coming down to watch the kids for us. This took me months to plan.\n\nI'll get some tickets to a show I love and a box still in its Amazon packaging.\n\nHere's where we differ. His attitude.\n\n>this is NOT the norm at all.\n\nMy partner would take me out like this occasionally over any given weekend if I asked or even bring it up himself (rare but he would and has). He most definitely would never complain about spending $15  at my bakery or getting me a book *on my freakin birthday*.  Your lols seems like a front and almost like your trying to convince yourself that he's not a complete AH who treats you like garbage.\n\n>I mean, we had fun.\n\nYou sure? It seems like you *tried* to have fun and make the best of it and he just grumbled. Cause if my partner acted like that every time I put another pastry on the tray, sighing and complaining about the price I'd immediately lose my appetite and it'd likely ruin the day for me. Take me to a bookstore only to expect me to pay for my own book. Even if he did *finally* \"relent\" and buy one. Gee thanks. \n\nTell you what, I for one can assure you that this is not typical behavior from my partner (you claim the same). If my partner did this I'd seriously **seriously** think something was wrong and would wonder. Did he lose his job and not tell me? Is one of his loved ones very sick or pass and he didn't want to \"ruin\" my day? Did someone try to convince him I was cheating and that's why he's being so mean?\n\nWhen this is TRULY abnormal behavior this is where the mind jumps to because something this crazy HAD to of happen for them to act like this. \n\nAsk yourself again if this is really outside the norm for him. None of us here on reddit know the answer to that.\n\nI hope you see your worth OP and reflect on your relationship with him. I'm not telling you to leave him, but you DO deserve better, be it from him or someone else.\n\nEdit: grammar, spelling and a couple of words", "Tell him you absolutely do not want to go to the baseball game.

So maybe things aren't as they seem?", "INFO: Is it possible that he is \"joking\" and taking you to the concert?", "INFO: When you say you found out it was baseball tickets - how did you find out? Perhaps the baseball is an elaborate ruse to throw you off the real gift of concert tickets? I'm reserving judgement incase husband pulls through...", "is there a chance he's just fuckin with you, and it's actually your fav artist he's taking you to?", "INFO: is it possible he\u2019s f*cking with you as a surprise? Like maybe the event really is the concert, and all your friends are going, and this behavior is just to throw you off the scent? I think it\u2019s a dumb way to surprise people, but it\u2019s a common trope. I\u2019d wait until Friday before deciding he\u2019s unequivocally the AH.", "NTA.

The man bitched about $9 worth of bakery food, ate all your cake, went golfing on your bday, didn't even want to buy you a book?? Please please please know your own worth and dump this waste of a person! \n\nNTA!\n\nEdit: I just read this to my husband who asked me how many of these posts do I think are fake. Usually a fair amount, but alas, this was my ex's way of behaving too, so I believe this post.", "NTA. You need a good talk with him about all this though, IMO sounds like he could be hiding some money issues or is it normal he'd get antsy about buying a book and a few dollars on pastries?", "What a cheapskate. If he starts making you out to be the bad guy in this, he probably has one foot out the door and doesn't wanna be the bad guy in the breakup.", "It sounds like he can't be bothered with you. And that's so sad as you sound wonderful. Never go all out for his birthday ever again. Just do the bare minimum. Because this person doesn't appreciate you and tbh it's disrespectful. I'd say more than anything, just a total lack of care or respect for you.", "Your husband has checked out. Like if you HATES baseball and its known and he does that for a gift \ud83d\ude31", "NTA. Would it be too late for you to arrange something for yourself.  All day you were waiting to see what he would do for you,  but maybe you should just do something for yourself.", "Sounds like he\u2019s hiding financial concerns", "NTA but this guy is definitely trying to break up with you but lacks the courage. it's impossible to be this mean and dense towards your SO. especially on their birthday. he refuses to invest time, emotions, money and anything else in this relationship. time to reconsider everything.", "Does your husband even like you?  Dude just break up with him.  Do you have kids with this asshole? If not please break clean now.  Don\u2019t be me and stuck around hoping he will change and be stuck with two kids and financially enmeshment.  \n\nNTA but YBWTA to yourself if you don\u2019t start putting yourself first.  Stop doing things for him.", "NTA - I\u2019d be pissed right off. Sounds like he put less than zero effort in. \nOn a side note - the baseball could still be fun, sometimes sporting events are about the atmosphere, drinks and food more than the sport. (But he definitely should not have got that for you)", "NTA", "NTA your husband sounds terrible....I'm sorry.", "Hell no NTA. This man put absolutely no thought into your gift whatsoever. Tell your husband he fucked up. That you don't like baseball, never liked baseball and never asked for baseball tickets.\n\nTake the tickets and tell them you'll go with a friend or sell them to someone at the venue. Or better yet make plans with another friend on the day the baseball game is and tell him to have fun since thats what he's really after. \n\nIf this is the ONLY instance of him doing something like this just put as much effort as he puts in from now on. If this isn't the first or only instance of this happening consider couples counselling.", "NTA. You know that you're off the hook for his birthday next year. Go to a spa for the morning, just you.

Honestly. Want better for yourself OP.", "For your own sake and self-respect, as well as setting boundaries, please do. Take yourself to a nice place and enjoy your evening while he is watching the game. NTA.\n\nHe is taking you for granted and doing the bare minimum so you can't say he didn't do anything. But in effect, that's exactly what he did. Taking you to a bookstore and not wanting to buy you a book for your birthday? Low class, selfish and inconsiderate.", ">Well long story short, I find out my gift is attending a baseball game. I was immediately annoyed because I HATE baseball (sorry baseball fans). Everyone knows I hate baseball. And he also hates it! I would rather just not get a gift at all then pretend to enjoy sitting through a whole baseball game...\n\nMy money is on your guy got those tickets for free from somewhere and thought he'd save some money on your present. You said yourself that you both don't like baseball. NTA, I'd be be pissed too, but you've kind of got to admire the brass balls of the guy. He's got more front than Brighton, lol.", "NAH. Hear me out!\n\nYour comments all but confirmed what I already suspected while reading your post: This fiasco was a fake-out, and your real birthday celebration (the concert) is on Friday. In an effort to enhance the coming surprise, your sweet but tactless husband played up the \"grumpy asshole\" act all day and was a little bit too convincing.\n\nThe Friday dinner reservations are also suspicious. I think your mom and husband are in cahoots, and they want to make sure you don't make any plans that will conflict with the concert. If the reservations are real, then you're probably going to head to the concert straight after dessert. This method for a last-minute surprise would also ensure that you already look nice for your special day!\n\nPlease disregard the full-time Redditors imploring you to file for divorce lol. Everyone is right to intuit that something is off here, but I sincerely doubt it's anything more than a cute birthday surprise from the people who love you most!\n\nEdit: slight rephrasing", "I almost can\u2019t believe this is real.

Like you throw him this super mega party and his gift is to\u2026\u201dattend\u201d a bookstore and bakery with you with no intentions to buy you a book or some pastries? (Based on his grumblings you mentioned). Then the baseball thing when neither of you like it? You have to admit\u2026this is a comically bad birthday and it really seems like he doesn\u2019t care at all\u2026so yeah I hope this is fake because I don\u2019t want anyone to go through this LMAO. If not, you\u2019re NTA and you really need to treat yourself to something nice. You deserve it :(", "It sounds like he is deliberately trying to make you hate him because he wants to break up (so that he can blame you for being \u201cungrateful\u201d, and he isn\u2019t the bad guy).\n\nKnowing that your birthday is a big deal for you, this is deliberate.\n\nGive the baseball tickets away to someone who likes baseball.  Thank him nicely and never mention it again.  Then wait.  He will do something else deliberately to push your buttons .\n\nNTA", "If his gift was somthing you could return, id do that.

I don't know enough about their relationship to know what odds are that this was a good approach to take. I would think if it was going to be a surprise there's about a million better ways to do it.", "In an early episode of The Simpsons, Homer gave Marge, as a \"birthday present\", a bowling ball (he bowled, she did not) with his name engraved on it.", "NTA but what you are describing is one of the worst birthdays ever! I can't imagine a man that *loved* his wife would do that to her. \n It's inexcusable and the fact that he was being Uber cheap about desserts is mind boggling \ud83e\udd2f\nI think that it's time for just the 2 of you to sit down and have a real honest heart to heart conversation. Something may be brewing or maybe not, but if you don't communicate with him, well you may end up with something *worse* than this birthday \ud83e\udd14", "Could the baseball tickets be a front for a different surprise?", "Is there any chance he is playing you??

These are the actions of someone who either strongly dislikes you, or is broke and doesn't want to admit it. The tickets sound like something he got for free from work or from a friend. This won't be the first time we find out someone has a secret gambling habit or secretly got fired or something.\n\nAnyway NTA, but you need to have a talk with him. This goes beyond frugality.", "What's weird to me is that he's acting like you're a burden... and he barely planned anything for your birthday. If this really is it, I would rethink whether he's even committed to you anymore.", "Especially considering they\u2019re married. He obviously sees his bank account as only his and vice versa.", "Is the band you like singing the national anthem?", "If this isn't the norm at all, I would definitely talk to him about it! You can do it in a way that doesn't make it seem like you're being ungrateful:\n\nHey, hon, I have something I want to discuss with you, is now a good time? Great! So, this birthday has felt really different from my previous birthdays, and I'm not sure if it's because we didn't get to spend as much time together or if the vibes were just off, but maybe we could have a do over?  Also, I wanted to talk to you about the baseball game. Did I do or say something that gave you the impression that I enjoy baseball or have you started to enjoy it? Because if not, maybe we can get a refund on the tickets and skip the game entirely. \n\nA conversation like that gives your partner lots of opportunities to answer those questions you have and you're not being accusatory or blaming them for anything. \n\nIt's possible the behavior and the baseball game is a red herring, especially if it's so out of character. And you could approach it that way, too. \n\nHey hon, I don't want to ruin a surprise if you had one planned, but I have to say that I'm really upset about my birthday and I will be honest, I'm not really feeling the baseball game, so if that was a cover for something, can you please let me know?\n\nI mean, I get wanting to surprise you, but his odd behavior is what ruined the surprise.
