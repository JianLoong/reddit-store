I understand being frustrated but it\u2019s not enough for you to reduce the amount you were giving him.

NTA", "The pretip thing now is. I\u2019m giving you a bonus to take the job, cause in some areas if i dont over big enough tip, people dont take the delivery", "Agreed. Especially on the apps where you can\u2019t change it unless you contact their service department", "\u201cTipping\u201d is really a misnomer with how the apps are set up, in my opinion. \n\nThey\u2019ve kept it so the drivers are independent contractors rather than employees, so there\u2019s no standard rate of pay, just the rate per order, which mostly comes down to the \u201ctip.\u201d The drivers get to pick which orders they want to take as well, and the app can\u2019t force them to take orders they don\u2019t want, which is why so much food goes undelivered. \n\nSo the \u201ctip\u201d is effectively a service bid - the drivers aren\u2019t willing to work on speculation, so they take the orders with a guaranteed offer. \n\nPersonally, I think the apps are a complete rip off for the businesses, drivers, and customers, so I don\u2019t use them. The places that did delivery before the apps existed still do today, and I\u2019d rather support those businesses than throw money away to an app. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is wrong here - I\u2019d still say NTA, but I think the pre-tipping model will always exist with how the apps are arranged.", "I know Skip makes you pre-tip, but you can also rate the driver afterwards. A fair number of them following the directions close enough that I don't mind; it's the ones that drop my order off where I can't find it that I have issues with.", "I\u2019ve intended to do that and just haven\u2019t followed through, you\u2019re right I\u2019m sure it would help in the future", "I've still had people knock and ring despite the obvious sign. It's ridiculous", "This! I have just taped the sticky note over the doorbell so they can't see/press it.\nBut seriously, they should read the notes. I figured after covid no one actually hands it to you anymore? Maybe I've just not updated my preferences.", "The note I put in the app specifically states the reason I ask them not to knock or ring the bell is the dogs and the baby though\u2026 the request is in 2 places on the app", "It is literally their job to read the request and deliver peoples food appropriately. This driver did not do part of their job. Next time they won\u2019t make the same mistake. OP is NTA.", "Nah. 90% of the delivery drivers just don\u2019t give a crap and blatantly ignore requests. It takes 3 seconds to read the delivery instructions and following them isn\u2019t difficult. OP NTA", "if you can't follow basic instructions, then you don't get to be surprised when your tip is effected. they should be lucky they still got 15%. in op's shoes, I'd have given them 5% for waking up my 2 month old child because they couldn't be bothered to read.", "if they want to get themselves arrested over 4 dollars, that's their prerogative", "Some of them don't bother to follow directions at all or even common sense! I had one who just left food there one day without ringing the doorbell, knocking, or texting. So it sat there for 15+ minutes because he was early, too. I got his tip removed and rated him poorly.", "Do you rely on the doorbell at all? Like ever? Because it's possible and fairly easy to disconnect the chime in a traditional one (smart doorbells can just have their volume muted). Might be mildly annoying... But then if anyone rings the bell again, nobody (namely the dogs and baby) is gonna know", "It\u2019s very possible he just rang it out of habit or muscle memory if he\u2019s making multiple deliveries though. I understand why you would be mad but I feel like reducing the amount from 25 to 15 is a dramatic response if the food got delivered in good shape on time.", "And you\u2019re acting like mistakes from misreading/not reading instructions never happen, or that people can\u2019t do something as simple as ring a doorbell on accident because they\u2019re using to doing it for other deliveries. These people are making dozens of deliveries a day, it\u2019s bound to happen. I don\u2019t understand why there is such a lack of empathy about that.", "Where did you get that statistic from? Because in my experience the drivers I\u2019ve had have mostly been good at following instructions. Like I said, i still think it\u2019s a small mistake considering the amount of deliveries these people have to make in one day. You\u2019re acting like you\u2019ve never made a mistake by misreading or not reading something fully, the difference is he\u2019s paying for it.", "I think I would\u2019ve been more inclined to reduce it by only 5% if it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that he was also waiting at the door when the selection I\u2019ve made is for them to drop it at the door and leave it. That just made me feel like he made 0 effort to look at the order details at all. I do see what you\u2019re saying though", "Yes well when you make mistakes at your job you are penalized. It\u2019s how it is dude. I feel more empathy for the new mom who\u2019s baby was woken up. Also, she reduced the tip amount to the average tip, she was already tipping a lot. It\u2019s not like she went from 15% to 5 %. I used to deliver food before my current job. The instructions are made clear on several pages and OP indicated that she wrote more than once. It is their job to look.", "Look through Reddit. There\u2019s thousands of stories similar to OPs. This is their job. Do it right or don\u2019t do it at all.", "The poor dude just rang a doorbell. Again, I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a mistake if the food still got there in one shape and still fresh, i understand from her perspective it\u2019s frustrating because she\u2019s the one dealing with the baby but in the grand scheme of things reducing the amount from 25 to 15 is an overkill response for that sort of \u201cpenalty\u201d.", "He didn\u2019t just ring a doorbell though, he failed to do part of his job, which is reading and following the delivery instructions. That\u2019s literally it- he failed to do his job appropriately and is being penalized. Nothing more to it.", "And I don\u2019t really think people should be penalized that harshly for a small mistake that anyone can make. I stand by what I said. I respect your opinion but we aren\u2019t going to come to an agreement on this lol", "25-30% is your standard tip? That\u2019s nuts.", "NTA. If the driver can\u2019t follow simple instructions. Leave at door. Don\u2019t ring or knock. They deserve to have a lower tip. You would tip less for poor service at a restaurant, same principle applies here. \n\nPersonally I hate the apps that have you tip in advance for this reason. If I get a shitty driver or experience it\u2019s more difficult to change tips later.", "Report him and the service will block him from delivering to you again. He is not allowed to contact you about the tip you give. \n\nNTA.", "Nah because this happened to me SO MANY TIMES as a new mother. The one doo dash driver couldn\u2019t find the house and my ex ended up meeting him at the Giant a minute away to get our food that we paid to not leave our house for. Most of the time it was due to language barriers which I felt bad for but also ??? If you can\u2019t read the instructions in English then you need to take the extra step to get a translator app or something. Also I\u2019m speaking as a pizza delivery driver who gets stiffed and intentionally \u201cno contact delivery\u201d so they don\u2019t have to look me in the face with no tip. So yes for 25% tip that I give it\u2019s so fucking frustrating when they knock/then keep WAITING at the door to maintain the barking (also had 2 dogs in the home with my newborn) \nI wish I changed the tip. Never did. Wish I did many times cause they didn\u2019t deserve it but I felt guilty that 98% couldn\u2019t speak English", "As a doordash driver the driver was an absolute asshole not you", "NTA. Also report the driver, they aren\u2019t allowed to harass you", "NTA, but I would suggest leaving a sign on your door that says \"SLEEPING BABY! DO NOT KNOCK OR RING DOORBELL!\" A lot of these delivery apps (I drive for two of them) tell us to ring or knock to alert the people inside to the delivery being here.", "Why didn't you reduce it to 0%? NTA", "Just a side note, I drive for Doordash occasionally, and there have been orders where it has said both \u201cLeave at door\u201d and \u201chand it to me.\u201d If this happened you would unknowingly be TA, but there\u2019s no way for you to tell", "Nta - i wish I could reduce tips on my app.  Unless they don't speak English, there really is no excuse for a delivery driver not to bother to read delivery instructions.  It's literally their job.  And if they don't speak English well, they could have someone explain the directions to them at the store.  Or get a different job I guess but that seems a bit cold.", "To me, YTA.  \n\nI assume delivery driver is a job of last resort in most cases and I've seen people who I suspect have literacy issues doing the job.  I'd be looking to give them every benefit of the doubt.  In this case that they were running trying to make a few more much needed bucks and didn't read the instructions or that they couldn't or forgot.", "NTA \n\nTipping was for a good service. Driver didn\u2019t do a good service, then doesn\u2019t get a nice tip", "Isn't it their job to read the instructions?  LOL, then of course you can reduce the tip for not doing as instructed.  You're NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou gave instructions, and the driver chose to ignore the instructions.  Woke up the baby, even when you said there was a baby.  Seems a good reason to me to reduce the tip.", "NTA. He is. He wants excellent tip he needs to provide excellent service and follow directions", "Reading is fundamental. They literally have one job. I always have the worst luck with them. NTA", "Nope, if a delivery guy woke up my baby when I specifically asked\u2026they\u2019d be lucky to get one at all. I\u2019d be pissed", "I will say NTA. I worked a delivery driver job for the past few years. It\u2019s great when people tip, but it\u2019s not required. I will say that it\u2019s hard to know when to listen to the comment boxes. People will ask for it to be delivered to the back yard once, and then they never change it back. I\u2019ve had a few people ask why I didn\u2019t ring the doorbell when the instructions said not to. As such, it helps to include the date when leaving your request. Just a simple \u201c11/6\u201d would let the driver know that the information is up-to-date. Nevertheless, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong here.", "I used to deliver food, and pretty much the only profit you make is from tips, so thank you for being a great tipper. I do think that muscle memory and habit were probably at play here. \nI have accidentally rang a doorbell when it was in the notes not to, and felt absolutely awful about it. I would have been very apologetic and understanding if my tip was reduced for any mistake I made. NTA", "What app were you using?  DoorDash and Uber Eats don't inform the driver of the tip until after the delivery is completed.\n\nAnyhow, NTA.", "NTA. If you are going to be a delivery driver you need to read the freaking instructions. Hell, wish we had  more of this back when I was a pizza driver when that was pretty much the only delivery. I used to spend lots of time lost in apt complexes that had no clear directions and no good signage to indicate what building was what. On my app I give very specific instructions how to find our house because it has a weird driveway, but 90% of drivers miss it and have to turn around because they wont read those notes. the ones that get it 1st try have usually exclaimed \"I'm glad you wrote the instructions, that was right where you said to go!\"  Read the notes and instructions drivers. It helps.", "NTA. that's a lazy driver. The least they can do is read the instructions.  You have certain requests for a reason. I have def canceled tip for the same reasons. I get delivery for convenience if you're going to inconvenience me..no tip.", "NTA I do dashes with my gf and it automatically reads it off and tells you multiple times leave at door", "You\u2019re not the asshole because you directly wrote what NOT to do. I would\u2019ve took more away", "NTA- 15% is a good tip. And his two jobs were to pick up food, and don't ring the bell. He basically only did half his job and still got a good tip, just not an excellent one.\n\nIf he wants excellent tips, he has to do excellent work. But he won't be the only one, it just as easily could've been the postal worker or a salesman. I'd disconnect the bell all together for a few months.", "NTA  I also have \"leave at door\" on my delivery instructions.  I don't want to talk to you.  I don't want to have to open my door at your command and try to figure out where all my animals are so they don't escape.  I don't want to hear you ring my doorbell then phone me while I'm on a work call.  LEAVE IT AT THE DOOR.", "NTA.\n\nI am very defensive of the tipping system and really really dislike tip free-riders.\n\nThis guy did his job explicitly poorly - exceptionally poorly - in such a way that he deserved to get stiffed harder than 15%.", "I have the same instructions in my food delivering app since I had my baby years ago. I may order food that is delivered at nap time or maybe later at night. I don\u2019t need the kid waking up. Most drivers adhere to this instruction and drop off the food and send me a text with the picture of the food at my door. But a few times they\u2019ve just ignored it and not slightly but blatantly. One guy literally pounded on the door until I opened it so he could hand it to me. I asked him if he read the instructions and he said yes but he didn\u2019t believe me that I would just want him to leave it outside\u2026that\u2019s definitely when I lowered the tip and also asked the company to no longer allow this driver to take my orders. Why would I bother writing all that out if I wanted you to ignore it? NTA.", "Now change the tip to 0%.", "NTA. As a doordash driver I agree about the tipping. Me personally I always read the delivery instructions. If I don't understand it I text first then call if I need help. It may only be a side gig but I try to treat people like I would want to be treated.", "The pre-tipping is often seen as a bid to the drivers, so the drivers can decide if your order is worth their time. I understand where the drivers are coming from with how they are paid, but honestly we need to get rid of tipping and go to having the company pay an actual living wage to people.", "Pre-tipping is so you get the food delivered quickest.  Pre-tip lower and you are not getting your food quickly.  Now, reducing the tip in this case is perfectly acceptable given the instructions.", "I order from restaurants that have their own delivery people, and I pay and tip in cash. I'm a big tipper, but I don't pay anything until I have the bag of food.", "Back in the day, tipping actually was always beforehand, standing for \"to insure promptness,\" essentially a prior guarantee of good service. It just changed overtime to come at the end as a bonus for good service. That was, of course, before electronics and apps and such", "The driver was just trying to pester for a cash tip. I've had quite a few pretend to not know what I'm saying when I say I've already tipped and they just chant \"tip! tip! tip!\" aggressively before handing over your order.  \n  \nSigns don't stop assholes like that. OP (esp as someone who just had a baby) is NTA and just needs to contact doordash support to have the order canceled and report the driver.", "Then more than one driver would have made the mistake. Everyone else got the memo but him.", "Apps nowadays literally have a translator built in. I\u2019ve had people who don\u2019t speak English message me on the app and there\u2019s a button next to it that says translate. It works both ways. More apps need that to accommodate non-English speaking drivers.", "I\u2019ve been a driver for these apps before and I\u2019ve also had a baby that never gave me a break. With that said if I rushed and didn\u2019t read someone\u2019s instructions and woke up their baby, I would not be bent out of shape at all if they decided not to tip at all. It\u2019s an easy job with very few steps. Read the damn instructions. Don\u2019t wake up people\u2019s babies. It\u2019s not that hard.", "For that, I'd contact the service department if I had to.", "\"To Insure Promptness\" is one of those things that sounds cool, but just is not true. A fun urban legend.", "I feel like without that or messaging him directly to let him know, it\u2019s too obtuse. Who has time to look through your delivery settings? They are vastly underpaid for their time already without special requests. Handing it to you in person prevents issues with fraud where you say that you didn\u2019t get it and fraud is frequent enough that it can cut into food drivers paycheck. Ideally, you find a way to fulfill your needs and accommodate drivers as well \u2014 at least leave a note with instructions at minimum", "I have a sign TO ring the doorbell and never knock because it\u2019s a second floor unit. \n\nPeople still insist on knocking and proceed to get upset when the door isn\u2019t answered immediately.", "Well I'm not really interested in having to take the time to get my car repaired or a broken light outside my house fixed.", "This is literally every instacart driver in my area.  It drives me insane.  Usually I have to buzz them in so it's not the end of the world, but sometimes they get buzzed in by someone else, don't bother to knock, then 3 hours later I'm thinking \"where the fuck is my food\"... and it's like \"oh, outside, melted and going bad.  Yay.\"  How hard is it to knock?  They don't even have to wait, just knock once and leave it at the door and I'd be happy.", "My husband disconnected the doorbell during a home improvement project, and never reconnected it. Zero regrets. Anybody who's at my house knows not to ring/knock anyway, and to text instead.\n\nOP was way to nice to the guy - I would have taken the whole tip away, and reported him to customer service. But I'm also the crazy chick who made the stump removal guy read out loud and explain my 'no solicitors, campaigners, or missionaries' when he tried asking if we wanted the stump in the yard removed.", "It's literally their job to read the delivery instructions.  If they can't be bothered to do the bare minimum of their job, they probably should get a different job.", "The \u201cleave it at the door\u201d setting is one of the three options that app gives you, and it\u2019s preset by the app- you can\u2019t skip that question. Face to face often does work for me- I\u2019m breast feeding and if my son loses his latch it can cause difficulty, so I can\u2019t always hop up to open the door. They can upload a photo of the food on the doorstep to help with the fraud concern. As I commented above, I do intend to put a sign up, but no one\u2019s ever had a problem with it before so it didn\u2019t feel super pressing", "What's next, they don't have time to drive? Don't have time to shop? Don't have time to deliver?", "I would had given him 0%. OP was too nice.", "Then apologize, don't insult.", "Do you tell them to do that?", "These people specifically take this type of job because they have trouble with traditional lines of work and interviewing process.", "I do now.  It honestly just seems obvious to me though.  I mean usually when you deliver something knocking is the default.  If you just bought someone's groceries, you know if there are perishables, so you'd think you'd knock.   It's not a hill I'm willing to die on, it's not something I wouldn't tip over, and I get now that it is the norm, it's just a pet peve.", "I wish it was the default.  I don\u2019t ask them to because I assume they are not going to be bothered to listen, and it will just aggravate me to death.", "I would do that with DoorDash. I'd put in the instruction to knock on the door and hand me my food because the porch cat would get into it. They NEVER did.", "He wasn't penalized that harshly. He still got a good tip-a quick google search will show you that everyone agrees that's the lowest percent you would tip for acceptable service, and that's what OP gave him. So frankly, he got tipped equal to if not better than what his service was worth."]}
