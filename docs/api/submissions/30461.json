You need to report him for harassment now, because he shouldn't be contacting you like that.", "NTA, but I recommend a sign on your door as well (\"please don't ring bell - baby sleeping\".)", "NTA and honestly I would report him.  Harassing people after the job is done for a tip they didn't deserve is totally unacceptable.", "Dude needs to learn to read.  NTA.", "NTA. If you gave clear instructions and he didn't read them/chose not to follow them then that's on him.", "NTA - Should\u2019ve tipped him zero", "NTA. He did not hold up his end of the bargain. His service was not good. He should be happy he got any tip at all.", "NTA his failure to follow the instructions caused an issue for you. Poor service = reduced tip.", "NTA - tips are never automatic, they are earned.  The instructions were there and every single driver knows them because they pop up on the screen with the order.  The driver is just projecting if they are getting upset over not following instructions.", "NTA. If there\u2019s a way to give feedback in the app about the driver, let them know he sent you angry messages. That\u2019s kind of scary, he knows where you live and contacting you after was not appropriate whether you reduced the tip or not.", "NtA, maybe next time he'll do his job.", "NTA at all.", "YTA", "YTA and I\u2019m surprised by the NTAs here. Reducing it from 25 to 15 for something like that seems excessive since it was a mistake and he probably had no idea it would be such a big deal to you to ring the doorbell- as you said it\u2019s a thankless job, you don\u2019t know if he was tired and just happened to miss that part of the instructions. I understand being frustrated but it\u2019s not enough for you to reduce the amount you were giving him. With that said he was unprofessional messaging you like that about it, but I understand why he would be frustrated given he probably didn\u2019t even know about your crying baby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe next time he will actually do what was instructed. I bet he thought you would give him an extra tip if you saw him face to face.", "NTA\n\nAs annoying as these things are, I never want to piss off a delivery person as they know where I live and can come back and damage my car or something.\n\nIt's not worth the $10 to piss off someone.", "frankly, the driver should be lucky you still left 15% given they ignored clear instructions. NTA", "The pretip thing now is. I\u2019m giving you a bonus to take the job, cause in some areas if i dont over big enough tip, people dont take the delivery", "Agreed. Especially on the apps where you can\u2019t change it unless you contact their service department", "\u201cTipping\u201d is really a misnomer with how the apps are set up, in my opinion. \n\nThey\u2019ve kept it so the drivers are independent contractors rather than employees, so there\u2019s no standard rate of pay, just the rate per order, which mostly comes down to the \u201ctip.\u201d The drivers get to pick which orders they want to take as well, and the app can\u2019t force them to take orders they don\u2019t want, which is why so much food goes undelivered. \n\nSo the \u201ctip\u201d is effectively a service bid - the drivers aren\u2019t willing to work on speculation, so they take the orders with a guaranteed offer. \n\nPersonally, I think the apps are a complete rip off for the businesses, drivers, and customers, so I don\u2019t use them. The places that did delivery before the apps existed still do today, and I\u2019d rather support those businesses than throw money away to an app. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is wrong here - I\u2019d still say NTA, but I think the pre-tipping model will always exist with how the apps are arranged.", "I know Skip makes you pre-tip, but you can also rate the driver afterwards. A fair number of them following the directions close enough that I don't mind; it's the ones that drop my order off where I can't find it that I have issues with.", "I\u2019ve intended to do that and just haven\u2019t followed through, you\u2019re right I\u2019m sure it would help in the future", "I've still had people knock and ring despite the obvious sign. It's ridiculous", "This! I have just taped the sticky note over the doorbell so they can't see/press it.\nBut seriously, they should read the notes. I figured after covid no one actually hands it to you anymore? Maybe I've just not updated my preferences.", "The note I put in the app specifically states the reason I ask them not to knock or ring the bell is the dogs and the baby though\u2026 the request is in 2 places on the app", "It is literally their job to read the request and deliver peoples food appropriately. This driver did not do part of their job. Next time they won\u2019t make the same mistake. OP is NTA.", "Nah. 90% of the delivery drivers just don\u2019t give a crap and blatantly ignore requests. It takes 3 seconds to read the delivery instructions and following them isn\u2019t difficult. OP NTA", "if you can't follow basic instructions, then you don't get to be surprised when your tip is effected. they should be lucky they still got 15%. in op's shoes, I'd have given them 5% for waking up my 2 month old child because they couldn't be bothered to read.", "if they want to get themselves arrested over 4 dollars, that's their prerogative", "Some of them don't bother to follow directions at all or even common sense! I had one who just left food there one day without ringing the doorbell, knocking, or texting. So it sat there for 15+ minutes because he was early, too. I got his tip removed and rated him poorly.", "Do you rely on the doorbell at all? Like ever? Because it's possible and fairly easy to disconnect the chime in a traditional one (smart doorbells can just have their volume muted). Might be mildly annoying... But then if anyone rings the bell again, nobody (namely the dogs and baby) is gonna know", "It\u2019s very possible he just rang it out of habit or muscle memory if he\u2019s making multiple deliveries though. I understand why you would be mad but I feel like reducing the amount from 25 to 15 is a dramatic response if the food got delivered in good shape on time.", "And you\u2019re acting like mistakes from misreading/not reading instructions never happen, or that people can\u2019t do something as simple as ring a doorbell on accident because they\u2019re using to doing it for other deliveries. These people are making dozens of deliveries a day, it\u2019s bound to happen. I don\u2019t understand why there is such a lack of empathy about that.", "Where did you get that statistic from? Because in my experience the drivers I\u2019ve had have mostly been good at following instructions. Like I said, i still think it\u2019s a small mistake considering the amount of deliveries these people have to make in one day. You\u2019re acting like you\u2019ve never made a mistake by misreading or not reading something fully, the difference is he\u2019s paying for it.", "I think I would\u2019ve been more inclined to reduce it by only 5% if it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that he was also waiting at the door when the selection I\u2019ve made is for them to drop it at the door and leave it. That just made me feel like he made 0 effort to look at the order details at all. I do see what you\u2019re saying though", "Yes well when you make mistakes at your job you are penalized. It\u2019s how it is dude. I feel more empathy for the new mom who\u2019s baby was woken up. Also, she reduced the tip amount to the average tip, she was already tipping a lot. It\u2019s not like she went from 15% to 5 %. I used to deliver food before my current job. The instructions are made clear on several pages and OP indicated that she wrote more than once. It is their job to look.", "Look through Reddit. There\u2019s thousands of stories similar to OPs. This is their job. Do it right or don\u2019t do it at all.", "The poor dude just rang a doorbell. Again, I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a mistake if the food still got there in one shape and still fresh, i understand from her perspective it\u2019s frustrating because she\u2019s the one dealing with the baby but in the grand scheme of things reducing the amount from 25 to 15 is an overkill response for that sort of \u201cpenalty\u201d.", "He didn\u2019t just ring a doorbell though, he failed to do part of his job, which is reading and following the delivery instructions. That\u2019s literally it- he failed to do his job appropriately and is being penalized. Nothing more to it.", "And I don\u2019t really think people should be penalized that harshly for a small mistake that anyone can make. I stand by what I said. I respect your opinion but we aren\u2019t going to come to an agreement on this lol"]}
