Also, throwaway.\n\nA bit of background: I (40f) am the youngest of 4 (about a year apart between each of us). My sister fell pregnant when I was 15 and got married, my eldest brother followed suit and got his (now wife) pregnant and got married. So both were married off by the time I was 16.\n\nMy other brother and I had supported my parents, both of us taking on full time jobs in our teens. We continued into our 20\u2019s paying for their rent. My brother and I rented an apartment, and then continued to help out our parents. When my elder brother decided to move out with his girlfriend about 2 years later, I took over the rent in full but still helped out my parents all while being a new mother. I had a second child two years later, on a single income. I went from paying 1/2 my parents rent to approximately 200/month for their rent plus groceries, as I had my own kids to support as well. My sister pays for their cable and internet, my elder brother pays for their mobile phone while my eldest doesn\u2019t really contribute but does with his time.\n\nOverall, I was the child that always made the most in terms of salary out of the 4 of us. During the pandemic, I was laid off and struggled for a bit to find a job. I found steady employment, though it is a far cry (approximately $15k less) than I used to make. So for right now, I don\u2019t help my parents regularly since about 2021. The last help I did was purchase a hospital bed and a wheelchair for my father for my parents home as he had landed in the hospital and unfortunately lost the ability to walk.\n\nMy parents want to retire and head back to the motherland, which I support and think they\u2019ll be happier. My siblings and I have a chat going on and they decided we would all set aside a monthly amount each to send back to them. They decided that they\u2019d send roughly $200 per month each and I would send $150 since I\u2019m on single income. This was all while I was on vacation (I had saved up to go to my first all-inclusive). I asked them how they came up with that figure and they said they could each afford $200.\n\nI then asked why wouldn\u2019t it be $100 since each of them decided each pair (all are now married) is contributing and they said if I could go on vacation, then I could afford $150 a month.\n\nI argued that I had to save for it and I shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice saving for things I want, just to support my parents. They called me selfish. I lost it and told them that I was done being everyone\u2019s ATM machine. I yelled about more specific things I did for my parents but in a nutshell, that I had been contributing for the majority of their needs for the last 12 years.\n\nAs it turns out, no one knew that I continued to help them, and my mum never told them.\n\nI feel guilty for yelling at my siblings.
