They have a child (2M) together and he has a child (14F) from a previous marriage. \n\nThey recently asked to borrow a dvd player for their car for a trip to Disney they were planning for Spring Break. I was confused because I know they have one. Turns out it belongs to his daughter and she won\u2019t let them borrow it because she isn\u2019t going on the trip.  She will be with her mom for the week. \n\nNow I admittedly do not know all the facts, but it really made me feel uncomfortable that she wasn\u2019t going on this trip with them. My husband seems to think it\u2019s no big deal. I feel like they should have planned the trip for when they all could go, especially since it is a big trip. I worry that going without her is going to hurt her feelings. And it sounds like she isn\u2019t happy since she won\u2019t even let them use her dvd player.  She already deals with a bit of anxiety and depression and I think they are being cruel by not making sure she\u2019s included. I really want to say something in a round about kind way but I know that it isn\u2019t a good idea. But I would like to know other people\u2019s opinions on the situation.

(My 16-yo son asked us to plan our family Disney trip when he was away at camp.) Maybe she's not allowed to go because she is being disciplined for whatever reason.

Why would you ever consider interfering if you don't have all the information? Do you want to be known as a busybody? Do you want to cause tension with both your husband and your in-law? Just don't lend them the DVD player and stay out of it.", "Maybe the 14 year old doesn\u2019t want to go on a trip with a 2 year old. It would be different if they had someone their own age to hang out with.", "She is with her mother. It's really none of your business.", "I get where you are coming from.

You're NTA if you are asking purely in the interest of the 14 year old.", "Lots of people firmly telling you not to bring it up but as a child of crappy parents who didn't consider me, I would have given a great deal to have another adult in my life who cared enough to raise injustices on my behalf. \n\nObviously going in hot and accusatory is a bad move since you don't know the facts. I would have a private conversation with your brother and ask what led to the decision to go at a time she couldn't go and how she feels about it. Approach with curiosity and concern instead of ire. He may not have considered how she would feel in any depth and having it queried may open that door. If he tells you to leave it alone then do, but I think YWNBTA for gently asking what led to her being excluded and if she's OK in a caring way that doesn't accuse your brother of doing wrong", "MYOB", "you seem pretty sure you've got the right read on things here. you asked what people thought and i'm seeing an overwhelmingly negative response, but it doesn't seem to have changed your mind. \n\ncan i ask why that is?", "I dislike the way OP seems to centre this on their SIL when the parent of the child in question is their BIL.", "I wouldn\u2019t say anything.

And if so why they are going to Disney if they can\u2019t afford to all go?", "It's always fun seeing OP's (like this one) who come here purely cause they want people to agree with them and not because they want to be judged. Just ignoring the purpose of this sub in an attempt to have your assholery validated only to be regarded as an even bigger asshole. Also if you havent gathered OP, yes you are the asshole, for one it's none of your business and two even if it was your responsibility to interfere in mundane issues that you play no part in, like pretty much everyone else said here, you dont know all the facts and are assuming everything besides the one thing you know that is, \"child is not going on Disney trip\" while they could easily be doing something else or not be invited because they did something wrong. YTA.", "NTA I would politely ask your brother what SD is doing. Then ask if she did she not want to go to Disney?", "I\u2019m going against the grain and saying YWNBTA, at least not if there\u2019s evidence that this is a pattern. It may be better coming from someone else, but I know so many stepkids who get deliberately left out of trips. It\u2019s heartbreaking and the longterm effects on family dynamics are not pretty. I kind of get it if a trip CAN\u2019T be scheduled to accommodate the child, but that\u2019s often not the case. \n\nIf this isn\u2019t a pattern then maybe let it go or get someone else to talk to them about it - maybe your spouse or in-laws that are the parents to either BIL or MIL. But if you\u2019re pretty confident about your read, then I think it\u2019s good someone is willing to stand up for the child here. But, the best way may be to inquire rather than accuse, like politely asking questions about if she didn\u2019t want to go or couldn\u2019t go or if her mom said know why they didn\u2019t plan a trip at a time they had her (the first three are probably better). This could lead into a conversation or at least a better gauge of the situation. \n\nI\u2019ve also seen this far too often to not be cynical about there being a good reason for this. It\u2019s almost always a repeated thing and indicative of the step-child not really being considered part of the family. I actually know someone who did this exact thing - planned a Disney trip when they knew the older stepchild who could remember wouldn\u2019t go but took the kids too young to remember. The  stepmom in this case always plans family trips when they don\u2019t have her step-child and she\u2019s even gone as far as to not include the step-child in pictures. Said stepchild has basically no self esteem now (was vibrant in the past) and hates going to her dad\u2019s. And unfortunately I\u2019ve seen this in a lot of blended families.", "NTA.  I get where you're coming from on this, and you are right. I have a blended family, and money was tight but we never planned a trip where one of the kids was left out.  It sounds like they picked a time where daughter was with mom so they didn't have to invite her.  Not cool.  And this decision will come back and bite them in the butt.  Also, I wouldn't loan them the DVD player.", "Yes they are , but you don\u2019t want to get involved that drama. Let them crash and burn all on their own.\n\nHopefully her mother is a better parent than her father.", "YWNBTA. Seems very cruel to me, taking their 2 year old, who probably won't remember anything about it, but *not* taking the 14 year old, who would really enjoy the trip and have lots of memories!   How do they think this is okay?  It's so mean. No wonder the 14 y/o has anxiety and depression, if this is how they treat her.", "NTA, but don\u2019t do it even though I agree with you, it\u2019s messed up. These people aren\u2019t your blood relatives and it\u2019s really more your husband\u2019s responsibility to stand up for his niece.", "They're AHs. & unfortunately it's too common.\n\nI was the stepchild & my mom & her (now ex-)husband used to do BS like this all the time. Half the time I didn't care because as a teen i didn't want to be around them anyway, but being excluded still hurt.\n\nYou could tell them you need your DVD player & ask how the stepdaughter feela about not being able to go.\n\nYou could also be insanely nice to her when you see her. Oddly, that doesn't take much. If you get the 2yo a present, give the teen a teen appropriate gift. If you go to the store &/or run errands, ask if she wants to go too.\n\nWhen my mom divorced her ex, I kept his siblings that were simply nice to me. They're aunt & uncle & get great hugs & pure excitement when I  see or hear them on the phone. But I ignore his ass because the AH is irrelevant. \n\nBe nice to her, because your SIL & BIL  are AHs & she knows it.", "Why are you so adamant on being nosy? YTA", "YWNBTA\n\nAs the child who was the outsider, it warms my heart to see someone wanting to stick up for the kid and see them included. Frankly the 14 year old would get more out of a disney trip than a 2 year old in terms of all the adventures. \n\nYou're right, kids absolutely feel left out of stuff like that. They wonder why they're not good enough to go with. Why they're not important enough. \n\nIt hurts to see kids who are the product of split parents, always getting left out of the big events. If you call them out on it, it's probably still going to cause issues. But it doesn't make you an asshole. And idk if she'd ever know you stood up for her or not. But this child left out would thank you and be proud of you", "YWBT\n\nA massive AH. You *do not* know what's going on. You sound judgemental and nosy. She's 2!! It's probably a hassle to take her and she's not even going to remember it. Maybe there's legal implications if they're going out of the country/state for it. Maybe her mother doesn't want her to go.
