It sounds like you are needing basic housekeeping chores to be done, you aren't requesting them to do a complete top to bottom cleaning of your house.", "NAH. But you should ask ahead of time if they'd be willing to do the tasks you normally would when preparing for and hosting guests. Lifting and carrying things is probably assumed, but they may not be expecting to mop up muddy paw prints and whatnot, so make sure to mention some of the more unusual tasks you ordinarily don't need help with but can't easily do right now.\n\nThe reason I say mention it ahead of time is a) to avoid risk of conflict with your friends since expectations would have been set in advance, and b) give them an opportunity to *not* stay with you if that's their preference. They may be perfectly willing to come help you out, but will get better rest if they stay elsewhere.", "NTA\n\nThey're coming to help, meaning they are coming to do the chores for you. Changing sheets and vacuuming is WHY they will be there.", "NAH. If you go into a request prepared to hear a \"no\", then you're never TA for asking for help.", "NTA. I'm sure they'll fully understand and be happy to help - I know I would!", "NTA - if they\u2019re coming because you\u2019re handing surgery, they likely know what they\u2019re in for. I would just mention this all before your guests arrive.", "I think this really depends on the level /nature of the friendship. I think the closer you are the less likely you are to be an A if you ask for help. However, some basic things like loading their dishes directly into the dishwasher rather than a sink etc are things you could ask even a passing acquaintance.", "NAH- OP you're never an AH for *asking* for help when you need it. \n\nYou're only ever an AH if you *demand* help. Your friends are free to respond as they wish, but hopefully, as your friends, they'll be willing to help you in your time of need.", "NTA - are they coming to help you or are they coming to visit??  You need to be clear.  If they are coming to keep you company, you really don\u2019t need that.  What you do need is someone to help clean your floors, do your laundry, make you meals, change the sheets on the guest bed\u2026. You don\u2019t need friends to visit who expect you to keep house and play hostess.\n\nIf your friends are coming to help you in your time of need, then they should expect to get asked to do chores.  Actually, they should be asking you what can they do for you as soon as they cross your doorstep.  \n\nYou know these friends, are they helpful friends, or are the social friends??  A helpful friend is someone who automatically helps clear the plates from the table without asking.  A social friend is someone who talks to you and waits for you to ask to help, and then does so half heartedly\u2026\n\nIn your time of need, you need helpful friends, and helpful friends would have no problem putting their sheets in the washer before they leave, and getting them out of the dryer and making their bed when they arrive.  Helpful friends want to wait on you and play hostess so that you can rest and heal.\n\nIf your friends aren\u2019t going to be helpful, then they need to postpone their visit until you are more independent.", "NTA- I would never stay with someone fresh off a debilitating medical procedure unless my intention was to help them with day to day tasks.", "NTA but I would definitely mention it before they come and not assume they\u2019ll help. I\u2019m sure any good friends will see that you need help and will just do it without prompting, but it\u2019s nice to mention it on the off chance they might not want to mind the dogs etc.", "NTA - I feel like if you\u2019re unwell and your friends offer to visit, they typically are visiting because they\u2019d want to assist you with tasks you normally would be able to do but can\u2019t because of your illness. \u201cA friend in need is a friend indeed\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll have no problem assisting you around the house. Best of luck and I hope you get better soon OP\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. In that shape. Sorry guys but help or Hotel. If they have a clue shouldn't need to ask. Nothing to feel bad about life happens.", "NTA.  If these are true friends hopefully they are coming with the assumption that they will help you and pitch in with household chores.\n\nThese visits by your friends are when you are recovering from hip surgery!  It is completely appropriate for you to request help.  \n\nIn my family when we leave after a visit, we take the sheets and towels off the bed and out of the bathroom and if possible, throw them in the wash  If there is time we fold and put away the laundry too.  My adult children even do it!  This happens with any visit.", "YWNBTA I'm pretty sure they will be there so that they can help you with these things. They know you're gonna be laid out so I'm sure they are anticipating this. Why else would they come stay with you after surgery? Sure, socialization is nice but I highly doubt they think you're going to be up and doing these things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019ll probably feel a shit ton better after day 3 with the repair/removal. \n\nAlso if you don\u2019t want to ask friends for help, try Craig\u2019s List. When I had my last major surgery, I found a guy to come and do laundry, run to the grocery, and clean for a few weeks.", "NTA... If I offered to stay, it would specifically be to do that stuff. One of my friends has so much shit to do that I visit frequently, to be with her and to help out. I often do the dishes and laundry, and we do lots of yardwork together.", "NTA. They are there to care for you, not as guests. Just tell them what you need.", "They are not coming as guests they are coming as caretakers, your caretakers...let them know what you need, that's what they are going to be there for", "NTA Your friends volunteered to come in order to help. There is  no reason you should have to worry about doing more than getting yourself from one room to another. I've had a few surgeries and know how rough recovery can be. One of the things that helped me was having a tote bag that I rigged with a shoulder strap so I could sling it cross body style so I could carry things from one place to another without using my hands. Another thing I did that helped was cooked a bunch of things in my slow cooker using the slow cooker lining bags. I stored the leftovers right in the bag and popped it into the freezer. When I needed something to eat, I moved the bag to the slow cooker and heated things up on low. I hope those few hints help ease your time at home after surgery. If your friends become more of a headache than a help, don't be afraid to ask them to go home. This is the time you should be more concerned about your own wellbeing than someone else's feelings. good luck to you.", "Oh gosh definitely not - just some small things to keep the place comfortable/fresh for everyone.", "Thanks, this is helpful - I'll definitely mention this in advance. And if they say no that's totally cool (though I would be surprised because they aren't those kinds of friends if that makes sense?) - them staying with me is not contingent on them doing my chores. No one will die if the floor gets a little muddy :)", "One person is my best friend/roommate from college and the other is also a best friend, we text most of the day and are very close.", "That should be no problem, then, especially since they volunteered to come and stay. They know you'll be less mobile and unable to do some things. \n\nNTA."]}
