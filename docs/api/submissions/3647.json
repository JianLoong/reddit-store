Most days, my wife feeds her breakfast, I feed her dinner. She mostly feeds herself, but we watch her so she doesn't die, spill shit all over, or if she has any \"requests\".\n\nI love my daughter. I would like that to be clear. She is my favourite person in the world, I spend a ton of time every day horsing around with her, teaching her letters/numbers, reading books. I put her to bed every other night, brush her teeth etc. I spend a lot of quality time with her imo.\n\n However, she is very boring to watch eat. It takes her about 30 minutes what amounts to maybe 1.5 cups of food and drink her milk. She spends about half the time playing with her fork, singing the alphabet, or blathering nonsense. \n\nWe are also trying to be mindful of using electronics around/in front of her. In particular, no phones at the dinner table.\n\nAbout a week ago, I was preparing dinner with my Airpods in, and realized that I could continue listening to music/podcasts while I was watching her eat, to make it at least a little more interesting. The other day, I decided to stick my phone in the napkin holder on the table (so my daughter couldn't see it), and watch Netflix. I thought this was **genius**. I only have one Airpod in, so I can still hear everything she says, I still am keeping an eye on her, I'm still sitting in front of her looking... in her general direction. But I'm watching TV. Now instead of dreading dinner time, I'm fine with it.\n\nAnyway, yesterday, my wife came home, with my MIL and \"caught me\" watching TV. When she came in, I pointed to the Airpod, then to the phone, and gave a thumbs up, thinking she too would think I'm a genius.\n\nWell, my wife's not happy. I'm not sure if it's her, or if it's her mom (who was really not happy), but she thinks I should be spending that time \"with\" my daughter. I think I am. I think my daughter is completely unaware that I am watching TV. So no harm, no foul. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669855567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9909l/aita_for_watching_tv_while_my_daughter_eats_dinner/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s also for you to bond with the daughter. Even if she doesn\u2019t understand you yet, the words she hears you speak to her are subconsciously affecting her development. Putting your phone/tv down for 30 min won\u2019t kill you", "YTA for making a post and then arguing with everyone because you don\u2019t like the judgment.

You are the adult, and children pick up on everything around them. Just because you aren\u2019t eating too does not mean you shouldn\u2019t respect this as her meal time and make some effort to interact with her. The fact that you say she\u2019s talking to herself makes you seem too dense to understand how parenting works. \n\nShe would simply love hearing your voice, just because you are her father. Is she going to provide riveting conversation? Probably not.

Before thinking it was a genius idea perhaps you should have talked to your wife about it.  IMO you aren't spending time with your daughter, of even making sure \"she doesn't die\" if your attention is elsewhere.  You aren't encouraging her to eat, you aren't talking about the food, or really doing anything.  You are teaching her that dinner time is quiet time.  You could be reading to her during that time.  I'm sure she'd like it or just pick something interesting and talk to her about it.  Children talk and learn from hearing the words, seeing pictures, or experiencing the world.

I think a bit of independence learning to eat/pace themselves is a good thing.  Sometimes there's fancy dinner time when everyone eats at the table, sometimes you have to just poke at your fork and talk to the microwave for a little bit.  I mean, at some point, you need to curtail dinner time - you can't just play with your food forever, but it doesn't sound like you're allowing that either.    \n\n\nI'd be more worried about her noticing you not paying attention to her and paying attention to the napkins just because kids are super attentive - not because you're necessarily doing anything wrong.", "NTA", "NTA", "I'm going with NAH because I'd probably be doing a similar thing, though it be more doing domestic work in the same room instead of the tv show.\n\nWhen kids are young and your actually feeding them it's a whole lot different then when they can feed themselves.  It's boring watching someone eat and you can say all you want about interaction etc but the kid is meant to be eating not having a full blow educational experience.  \n\nThough it would be alot better when you's can share dinner together, though I assume the early dinner for her is because she goes to sleep early.", "I feel like lot of people here have never raised kids. This is not going to mess your kid up. NTA I\u2019ll take your word that you\u2019re spending around 3 hours with her each day.", "NAH. I totally get it and it is a pretty great idea. My daughter is a super slow eater also. However, your wife clearly doesn\u2019t like this plan, so you should find a way to handle it that you both agree on. Or at least that she doesn\u2019t hate. \n\nWe would sit with my daughter for 20-30 minutes and then get up. We\u2019d stay nearby but maybe clean up or something. We told her it was healthy to eat slowly and she was doing a great job and could sit for as long as she wanted, but we had to start getting ready for bedtime (or whatever excuse). To me that does feel a little different than just starting to watch TV while she\u2019s still eating.\n\nAlso my daughter is 7 now and finally eats at a much more normal speed, so there is hope!", "NTA. You are there, you are present. You are watching her and helping when needed. I see absolutely nothing wrong here.", "NTA-  a 2 year old takes a lot of time eating, I do other stuff while she\u2019s eating but I\u2019m still in the room with her watching and talking with her.", "You're NTA. Yes, these times at this age are priceless and will go by too fast. Blink and she will be 16. But they're also tedious sometimes and you don't have to be 100% engaged and enthralled with your child every waking minute to be a good parent.", "NTA - Seriously?  You're supposed to just sit there and stare at the child while she blathers, recites ABCs and smashes her food into the plate?  I'm not sure but that might violate certain constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment!  She's not \"engaging\" with you, she's eating her freaking food!  Your wife and/or her mother, need to freaking chill or take over the most boring vigil in the known universe.  There's no harm being done here at all and making you do this the most boring way possible is just being PITA.", "NTA. Toddlers are slow eaters. It\u2019s why in the old days parents used to hand feed them - to speed up the meal and keep things cleaner. In some parts of the world people still do this. In the west letting toddlers feed themselves is currently the practice. But honestly a lot of parents are busy while their toddlers eat - especially if they have other children. Since you spend a lot of time with your child I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to do something while she eats. But electronics might need to be a no go because you won\u2019t want to set expectations that everyone plays with their phones at meals.

If you're spending lots of time with her during the day then it's fine if you get some time off during dinner or whatsoever. But you still have to be careful and pay more attention to your child nonetheless. Plus can we not invalidate a dad's feelings as well?

Don't just sit there watching her eat (why would you do that?). Meals are great opportunities to chat, even though she's only 2.

You taught her that behaviour.\n\nI have 5 kids in my daycare every day, age ranging from 0 to 4 and we always sit at the table together for meals and we all eat and chat.

Even though you are sitting at the table with your daughter, you are still absent, and she is very much aware that she is still eating alone.

Aside from monitoring their eating habits, we had a great time \"talking\" to them, correcting and expanding on their speech, laughing and joking. They ended up growing up to enjoy a huge variety of foods, use table manners, talk well in social circles, and have a great sense of humor. Then there is our grandson whose father works full-time and mother stays at home. She plops down food in front of him, then disappears into her room to be on her phone. He's left alone to make a mess of his food with no one to talk to, to me the saddest thing to see. He's three-years old and can't formulate words or simple sentences at all even though she does everything else that you're doing outside of meals. Almost 30 years later, my husband gets teary-eyed, missing those days when the kids were small, the day he sold the child's table and four chairs.
