Most days, my wife feeds her breakfast, I feed her dinner. She mostly feeds herself, but we watch her so she doesn't die, spill shit all over, or if she has any \"requests\".\n\nI love my daughter. I would like that to be clear. She is my favourite person in the world, I spend a ton of time every day horsing around with her, teaching her letters/numbers, reading books. I put her to bed every other night, brush her teeth etc. I spend a lot of quality time with her imo.\n\n However, she is very boring to watch eat. It takes her about 30 minutes what amounts to maybe 1.5 cups of food and drink her milk. She spends about half the time playing with her fork, singing the alphabet, or blathering nonsense. \n\nWe are also trying to be mindful of using electronics around/in front of her. In particular, no phones at the dinner table.\n\nAbout a week ago, I was preparing dinner with my Airpods in, and realized that I could continue listening to music/podcasts while I was watching her eat, to make it at least a little more interesting. The other day, I decided to stick my phone in the napkin holder on the table (so my daughter couldn't see it), and watch Netflix. I thought this was **genius**. I only have one Airpod in, so I can still hear everything she says, I still am keeping an eye on her, I'm still sitting in front of her looking... in her general direction. But I'm watching TV. Now instead of dreading dinner time, I'm fine with it.\n\nAnyway, yesterday, my wife came home, with my MIL and \"caught me\" watching TV. When she came in, I pointed to the Airpod, then to the phone, and gave a thumbs up, thinking she too would think I'm a genius.\n\nWell, my wife's not happy. I'm not sure if it's her, or if it's her mom (who was really not happy), but she thinks I should be spending that time \"with\" my daughter. I think I am. I think my daughter is completely unaware that I am watching TV. So no harm, no foul. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669855567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9909l/aita_for_watching_tv_while_my_daughter_eats_dinner/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s also for you to bond with the daughter. Even if she doesn\u2019t understand you yet, the words she hears you speak to her are subconsciously affecting her development. Putting your phone/tv down for 30 min won\u2019t kill you", "YTA for making a post and then arguing with everyone because you don\u2019t like the judgment.

You are the adult, and children pick up on everything around them. Just because you aren\u2019t eating too does not mean you shouldn\u2019t respect this as her meal time and make some effort to interact with her. The fact that you say she\u2019s talking to herself makes you seem too dense to understand how parenting works. \n\nShe would simply love hearing your voice, just because you are her father. Is she going to provide riveting conversation? Probably not.

Before thinking it was a genius idea perhaps you should have talked to your wife about it.  IMO you aren't spending time with your daughter, of even making sure \"she doesn't die\" if your attention is elsewhere.  You aren't encouraging her to eat, you aren't talking about the food, or really doing anything.  You are teaching her that dinner time is quiet time.  You could be reading to her during that time.  I'm sure she'd like it or just pick something interesting and talk to her about it.  Children talk and learn from hearing the words, seeing pictures, or experiencing the world.

I think a bit of independence learning to eat/pace themselves is a good thing.  Sometimes there's fancy dinner time when everyone eats at the table, sometimes you have to just poke at your fork and talk to the microwave for a little bit.  I mean, at some point, you need to curtail dinner time - you can't just play with your food forever, but it doesn't sound like you're allowing that either.    \n\n\nI'd be more worried about her noticing you not paying attention to her and paying attention to the napkins just because kids are super attentive - not because you're necessarily doing anything wrong.", "NTA", "NTA", "I'm going with NAH because I'd probably be doing a similar thing, though it be more doing domestic work in the same room instead of the tv show.\n\nWhen kids are young and your actually feeding them it's a whole lot different then when they can feed themselves.  It's boring watching someone eat and you can say all you want about interaction etc but the kid is meant to be eating not having a full blow educational experience.  \n\nThough it would be alot better when you's can share dinner together, though I assume the early dinner for her is because she goes to sleep early.", "I feel like lot of people here have never raised kids.

My daughter is a super slow eater also. However, your wife clearly doesn\u2019t like this plan, so you should find a way to handle it that you both agree on. Or at least that she doesn\u2019t hate. \n\nWe would sit with my daughter for 20-30 minutes and then get up. We\u2019d stay nearby but maybe clean up or something. We told her it was healthy to eat slowly and she was doing a great job and could sit for as long as she wanted, but we had to start getting ready for bedtime (or whatever excuse). To me that does feel a little different than just starting to watch TV while she\u2019s still eating.\n\nAlso my daughter is 7 now and finally eats at a much more normal speed, so there is hope!", "NTA. You are there, you are present. You are watching her and helping when needed.

Yes, these times at this age are priceless and will go by too fast. Blink and she will be 16.

You're supposed to just sit there and stare at the child while she blathers, recites ABCs and smashes her food into the plate?  I'm not sure but that might violate certain constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment!  She's not \"engaging\" with you, she's eating her freaking food!  Your wife and/or her mother, need to freaking chill or take over the most boring vigil in the known universe.

It\u2019s why in the old days parents used to hand feed them - to speed up the meal and keep things cleaner. In some parts of the world people still do this. In the west letting toddlers feed themselves is currently the practice. But honestly a lot of parents are busy while their toddlers eat - especially if they have other children. Since you spend a lot of time with your child I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to do something while she eats.

Don't just sit there watching her eat (why would you do that?). Meals are great opportunities to chat, even though she's only 2.

Not every moment with kids is magical. Sometimes it\u2019s boring. If your kid is having her needs met it\u2019s ok to do something for yourself every once in a while. You sound like a good dad.

I tend to believe she does notice.", "Well, since I was a 2nd grade teacher until I messed up my knee it was about 5 hours a day.  MY kids are out of the house.  They all -4- were very intelligent people so I think I know what I'm talking about.  I talked to them a lot when they were babies, read to them a lot, and asked their opinion a lot.  \"What do you think about that?\"  Of course all they did was babble but all of them were reading before going to school, and 2 out of 4 of them were members of the Academic Decathlon for 2 years of high school, along with playing soccer, being involved in dance and wrestling.  All of them won academic awards and were praised.  One child skipped a grade.  \n\nThey were children.  I think a lot of that.  Children are very important to our society.  We all have to do our part to raise our children to be good contributing citizens.  They deserved my attention and thoughts more time than not.  Wasting my time with them by watching TV was just that a waste.  So, you tell me... is your child worth your time?", "You know there is a massive difference between blinking/looking away and watching netflix.

OP doesn't ignore them, their kid is feeding and amusing themselves, OP is making sure they don't choke but are doing age appropriate feeding with hands. Not everything about parenthood needs to be ooooohhh sooo much fuuuun and engagement every. single. second.  Clearly the kid doesn't care if they're making faces in the microwave. The ability to self soothe and be comfortable with themselves is key in growth too.

People don't generally become parents strictly for the entertainment value though.\n\n Do you have any kids?", "Does your child eat differently when you eat with her? Or is it the same when she is eating alone. The way to encourage language is to communicate with your child, and bridge the gap. You find she is playing with her food, talk about what she is eating, the different things on her plate. \n\nMaybe even try moving her dinner time by a half hour and eat dinner with her from 5:30-6:30, it's interesting what happens when children have proper eating habits modeled for them.", "Not currently,   \nI was offering a suggestion that might work in your situation as your post made it sound as if this was the only meal you interacted with.  I could only assess situation as you presented it.", "Because you're staring at a screen instead of engaging with her. Obviously. So maybe the microwave is more interesting than what you're offering.\n\nMove on, you came here for judgment remember.", "Bc she a god damn 2 year old.", "Then why did you post in her asking?", "Because she's two?", "You sound like you\u2019re already disinterested/disconnected from her when you supervise when she eats. So her talking to her own reflection makes sense. She\u2019s already able to pick up on more than you\u2019d think. If you try to engage a little more, she\u2019ll probably direct herself more towards attempting to talk to you instead of her own reflection. They can\u2019t fully articulate their thoughts yet, but they do have thoughts. Parents can usually figure out most of what their toddler is saying. I know that it\u2019s boring as hell (or just frustrating) to try to have a conversation with a tiny human when they aren\u2019t fully capable of conversation just yet, but meal time is a good time to practice that.\n\nAsk questions about what the food is called, what she\u2019s eating off of/with. What it tastes like to her. Just try to engage as best you can. \n\nBasically you\u2019ve been teaching her that dad will engage fully *unless she\u2019s eating*. Child development is weird and confusing af. They pick up and hold onto all kinds of weird stuff that seems arbitrary or pointless to most adults. Random things done around a baby/toddler/young child can show well into adulthood in their personality, how they respond to emotions, and their behavior patterns. She\u2019s already showing that she knows you aren\u2019t interested in talking with (or to) her when she eats, *that\u2019s why she talks to her own reflection*.\n\nOn top of that, you\u2019re missing a golden opportunity to do the \u201cwho is that?\u201d \u201cIs that you?\u201d \u201cLook at you!\u201d thing. Kids lose their minds over the concept of seeing themselves because usually they don\u2019t see themselves (mirrors are typically hung too high for them to see). To you, your reflection is a normal thing you see during the day, but to her it\u2019s totally mind blowing that she can see herself. Seriously just hold her up in a mirror, she\u2019ll probably try to talk to or touch her reflection because it\u2019s new and exciting for her little toddler mind.\n\nI know that watching a toddler eat is boring, but if you really believe that she\u2019s your favorite person in the world, then you gotta put in the effort to show her that she is even during the boring stuff.\n\nI know that you think you found something to make meal time less boring for you, but it\u2019s ultimately at the expense of your daughter in the end. She\u2019s still seeing dad not fully engaged or interested in her when she eats whether you\u2019re watching a show on your phone or not.", "Your comments solidify you as TA lol we have dinner with our child from 5-6.

She eats at 5 because you and her mother decided she eats at five. Is there a reason she needs to be up early so 7 is the time she HAS to go to bed? \n\nThe biggest problem here is you aren\u2019t eating with her so you aren\u2019t modeling good eating and good table manners/habits. You and your wife should be eating with her if at all possible. And yes, you should be talking to her. If she is talking to her reflection rather than you, you are clearly checked out and she knows it. Is this the worst thing in the world, no. Is it good parenting, also no. \n\nYou seem to have some very messed up opinions on when to engage and when to back off. Other parents are telling you to talk to her during supper, this is a time to engage and be social. At least some of the time she is playing, she should be playing with out you actively engaging. If she says \u201cHey Daddy look!\u201d you do so and comment. But part of play time is a better time for you to be doing your thing while she is doing hers and encouraging independence. Parallel play if you will. She needs to learn to entertain herself. It is completely ok to play with her sometimes, but really shouldn\u2019t be all of the time.", "YTA mate, \n\nWe eat when the kids eat, yeah we may go back for more later, but eating as a family is important.
