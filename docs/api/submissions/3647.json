Most days, my wife feeds her breakfast, I feed her dinner. She mostly feeds herself, but we watch her so she doesn't die, spill shit all over, or if she has any \"requests\".\n\nI love my daughter. I would like that to be clear. She is my favourite person in the world, I spend a ton of time every day horsing around with her, teaching her letters/numbers, reading books. I put her to bed every other night, brush her teeth etc. I spend a lot of quality time with her imo.\n\n However, she is very boring to watch eat. It takes her about 30 minutes what amounts to maybe 1.5 cups of food and drink her milk. She spends about half the time playing with her fork, singing the alphabet, or blathering nonsense. \n\nWe are also trying to be mindful of using electronics around/in front of her. In particular, no phones at the dinner table.\n\nAbout a week ago, I was preparing dinner with my Airpods in, and realized that I could continue listening to music/podcasts while I was watching her eat, to make it at least a little more interesting. The other day, I decided to stick my phone in the napkin holder on the table (so my daughter couldn't see it), and watch Netflix. I thought this was **genius**. I only have one Airpod in, so I can still hear everything she says, I still am keeping an eye on her, I'm still sitting in front of her looking... in her general direction. But I'm watching TV. Now instead of dreading dinner time, I'm fine with it.\n\nAnyway, yesterday, my wife came home, with my MIL and \"caught me\" watching TV. When she came in, I pointed to the Airpod, then to the phone, and gave a thumbs up, thinking she too would think I'm a genius.\n\nWell, my wife's not happy. I'm not sure if it's her, or if it's her mom (who was really not happy), but she thinks I should be spending that time \"with\" my daughter. I think I am. I think my daughter is completely unaware that I am watching TV. So no harm, no foul. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669855567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9909l/aita_for_watching_tv_while_my_daughter_eats_dinner/", "score": 653, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s also for you to bond with the daughter. Even if she doesn\u2019t understand you yet, the words she hears you speak to her are subconsciously affecting her development. Putting your phone/tv down for 30 min won\u2019t kill you", "YTA for making a post and then arguing with everyone because you don\u2019t like the judgment.

You are the adult, and children pick up on everything around them. Just because you aren\u2019t eating too does not mean you shouldn\u2019t respect this as her meal time and make some effort to interact with her. The fact that you say she\u2019s talking to herself makes you seem too dense to understand how parenting works. \n\nShe would simply love hearing your voice, just because you are her father. Is she going to provide riveting conversation? Probably not.

Before thinking it was a genius idea perhaps you should have talked to your wife about it.  IMO you aren't spending time with your daughter, of even making sure \"she doesn't die\" if your attention is elsewhere.  You aren't encouraging her to eat, you aren't talking about the food, or really doing anything.  You are teaching her that dinner time is quiet time.  You could be reading to her during that time.  I'm sure she'd like it or just pick something interesting and talk to her about it.  Children talk and learn from hearing the words, seeing pictures, or experiencing the world.

I think a bit of independence learning to eat/pace themselves is a good thing.  Sometimes there's fancy dinner time when everyone eats at the table, sometimes you have to just poke at your fork and talk to the microwave for a little bit.  I mean, at some point, you need to curtail dinner time - you can't just play with your food forever, but it doesn't sound like you're allowing that either.    \n\n\nI'd be more worried about her noticing you not paying attention to her and paying attention to the napkins just because kids are super attentive - not because you're necessarily doing anything wrong.", "NTA", "NTA", "I'm going with NAH because I'd probably be doing a similar thing, though it be more doing domestic work in the same room instead of the tv show.\n\nWhen kids are young and your actually feeding them it's a whole lot different then when they can feed themselves.  It's boring watching someone eat and you can say all you want about interaction etc but the kid is meant to be eating not having a full blow educational experience.  \n\nThough it would be alot better when you's can share dinner together, though I assume the early dinner for her is because she goes to sleep early.", "I feel like lot of people here have never raised kids. This is not going to mess your kid up. NTA I\u2019ll take your word that you\u2019re spending around 3 hours with her each day.", "NAH. I totally get it and it is a pretty great idea. My daughter is a super slow eater also. However, your wife clearly doesn\u2019t like this plan, so you should find a way to handle it that you both agree on. Or at least that she doesn\u2019t hate. \n\nWe would sit with my daughter for 20-30 minutes and then get up. We\u2019d stay nearby but maybe clean up or something. We told her it was healthy to eat slowly and she was doing a great job and could sit for as long as she wanted, but we had to start getting ready for bedtime (or whatever excuse). To me that does feel a little different than just starting to watch TV while she\u2019s still eating.\n\nAlso my daughter is 7 now and finally eats at a much more normal speed, so there is hope!", "NTA. You are there, you are present. You are watching her and helping when needed.

Yes, these times at this age are priceless and will go by too fast. Blink and she will be 16.

You're supposed to just sit there and stare at the child while she blathers, recites ABCs and smashes her food into the plate?  I'm not sure but that might violate certain constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment!  She's not \"engaging\" with you, she's eating her freaking food!  Your wife and/or her mother, need to freaking chill or take over the most boring vigil in the known universe.

It\u2019s why in the old days parents used to hand feed them - to speed up the meal and keep things cleaner. In some parts of the world people still do this. In the west letting toddlers feed themselves is currently the practice. But honestly a lot of parents are busy while their toddlers eat - especially if they have other children. Since you spend a lot of time with your child I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to do something while she eats.

If you're spending lots of time with her during the day then it's fine if you get some time off during dinner or whatsoever. But you still have to be careful and pay more attention to your child nonetheless. Plus can we not invalidate a dad's feelings as well?

Don't just sit there watching her eat (why would you do that?). Meals are great opportunities to chat, even though she's only 2.

(still no screens see?)", "NTA. At all.", "YTA. If you agreed no phones at meals, don\u2019t watch Netflix on sly. She is 2, but kids are aware when you attention is elsewhere. Not having entertainment for 30 mins is not the end of the world.", "YTA for the way you\u2019ve responded to everyone on here. You came for a judgment and it was bestowed upon you. Now go change your own diaper and warm up some milk for yourself ya big baby", "Nah, but switch to a podcast cause screen addiction in kiddos is real", "Fuck everyone's \"family time\" responses. Kids are awful.  You gotta keep your sanity somehow.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I commend your creativity,  Sir.", "NTA. They don\u2019t require you to watch them eat uninterrupted", "Yeah, sorry, YTA. Communication, verbal and non-verbal, is so important at that age.\n\nImagine sitting next to someone zoned out with a flat facial expression while you share about your day and your joy if sharing time with them. Sounds awful, right? \n\nNot sure why you thought it was so one dimensional.", "Ummm didn't we all grow up eating dinner while watching TV? Not really sure how this is different other than he isn't sharing the TV with her. I'm gonna say NTA but your a tiny bit TA for not putting the show in a speaker so your daughter can enjoy it too.", "I also have a two year old\u2026why don\u2019t y\u2019all eat together as a family??", "NTA. If all of your time spent with her was focused on TV, you'd totally be TA. Nothing wrong with a little Netflix while she eats.", "YTA \n\nI thought this was a wholesome post about dad-antics at first, then I read OPs comments.\n\nHe calls commenters \"shitty parents\" for disagreeing with him, calls someone who grew up raising their siblings a \"glorified babysitter\" and that they don't have real kids so they don't know, calls them \"lazy\" or \"smothering\" and has said in multiple comments that if you don't have kids you don't get an opinion.\n\nPlease read the comments before making a judgement, it changes everything imo.", "She definitely knows you\u2019re distracted. Children are really intuitive", "NTA.  You spend quality time with her at other points in the day.  Usually breakfast is quiet for us.

You\u2019re meant to be interacting with them.", "YTA. I get needing to occasionally tap out - we\u2019ve all hit parent burnout but if this your main routine, it\u2019s not ok. Hang out with your kid, encourage her speech, work on her dexterity, but also just enjoy it. You won\u2019t get this time back.", "YTA - It\u2019s ironic that you have the attention span of a two year old and need constant entertainment.  You should be taking the opportunity to talk back and forth with your daughter, even if her words seem like nonsense.  Dinner is a social time.", "Interacting with toddlers can be mind-numbing any time of day, but you are setting the stage for life-long habits and dinnertime interaction is incredibly important to her development.

YTA", "I\u2019m between N A H and ESH. I agree that it\u2019s pretty smart, I have at times also halfway checked out while dealing with the monotony of some child rearing, but you and your wife should both be at the table eating with your child, modeling grown up behavior. How to eat, communicate, etc. Mealtime isn\u2019t about others sitting and watching her eat, and it doesn\u2019t end the second she\u2019s done.

You should always have an eye on babies and toddlers who are eating for this reason.", "YES! And 2 year olds have a range of language skills. Mine is delayed and only had about 20 words.

If out of 5-6 hrs of full engagement without electronics, how that 30min of less engagement so atrocious?", "He did say he was watching Netflix.  Probably not that engaged with the napkin.", "Bro this is parenthood, did you forget babies grow into developing adults you have to *gasp* spend all your time with???", "Or play music out loud.\nShe gets to watch you dance around the kitchen while you do a few dishes etc.", "Why don\u2019t you slide her dinner to 5:30 or 6:00 and eat with her?  She should be learning to eat what you eat anyways, even if she has some of her own items.  We just always ate with our kiddo at that age.  I don\u2019t think it would have occurred to me to do separate meals.", "Right??? That dad is such a good parent. Hope he and little dude (who\u2019s probably like 6 now? Idk) are discussing particle physics, GoT, instant pot techniques, whatever else little dude wants bc he\u2019s clearly not truly a kid with kid brain, he\u2019s a very small adult with a very active, curious brain. Which is so cool.", "This comment right here.\n\nI mean, different strokes and whatnot, but watching your kid eat should absolutely not be such a big thing.\n\nAs long as OP responds when kiddo is \"blathering nonsense\", making sure she doesn't choke and attending to her requests, then it's whatever.\n\nSomeone on this comment thread said 2 is a great time to learn that the world doesnt revolve around her.", "Indeed! Really curious how many y t a respondents are actually parents...", "The people who don't see the reasonableness of having the phone to listen to during the toddler's dinner either don't have kids or they are the type of parent who end up being helicopter parents. He does not have to be laser-focused on her every moment of their time together as long as he's responding to her when she talks to him.\n\nHe can't go on listening to podcasts/watching Netflix during dinner forever. It won't be long before his daughter engages with him more during dinnertime, but for now it's an excellent way to keep from losing his mind during the meal.\n\nI'm a mom of three. They're adults now and I wish I'd had podcasts and Netflix back then.", "Agreed. I had podcasts on or a music station on in the background when I only had one toddler to feed. So I could sing, be silly, laugh etc and kiddo would join in. \n\nNow I have two toddlers - storybots is our best friend at meal times.", "I\u2019m losing my mind with these Y T A comments. The guy is taking half an hour to watch a bit of Netflix whilst his child is otherwise entertained.\n\nIf this was a woman, the comments would be entirely different. \u201cYou need your downtime, if he doesn\u2019t like the way you parent then he should stay home, being a SAHM is hard and you have the right to take a break\u201d\n\nHe sounds like a great Dad overall, NTA.", "Right? Like, what are these comments even??? Not a parent, but I've been babysitting my little cousins since I was 10; what everyone is saying is too much work. Someone even suggested *reading a book* to them while eating, like wtf.", "Finally, words of wisdom and truth.", "Agreed!\n\nNTA.", "Two is tough. Anyone who says you have to sit and watch your kid at that age doesn\u2019t remember that age.", "I can't believe how far I had to scroll down to see this comment...it should have been first. The number of people who seem to have no idea about the realities (and boredom) you have as a parent is depressing. I have 4 boys aged 26-13 and a few of these almost made me sprain my eyeballs as I was rolling them back so hard.

When he\u2019s older it\u2019ll be different. \n\nI\u2019m in the NTA camp. You can listen to Netflix and still interact with your kid.

Good lord 2 year olds can be monotonous.   It his comments are kind of AHish and dismissive.  I think they would be better off changing the routine as kiddo gets older to try to eat dinner together.  I always fed kid dinner during our dinner as soon as she turned 1 because it was easier for me and less\u2026boring.\n\nAll I can think is that OP is in for a boredom shock when the kid can talk and wants to play the same 4 minute pretend scenario over and over again.
