Most days, my wife feeds her breakfast, I feed her dinner. She mostly feeds herself, but we watch her so she doesn't die, spill shit all over, or if she has any \"requests\".\n\nI love my daughter. I would like that to be clear. She is my favourite person in the world, I spend a ton of time every day horsing around with her, teaching her letters/numbers, reading books. I put her to bed every other night, brush her teeth etc. I spend a lot of quality time with her imo.\n\n However, she is very boring to watch eat. It takes her about 30 minutes what amounts to maybe 1.5 cups of food and drink her milk. She spends about half the time playing with her fork, singing the alphabet, or blathering nonsense. \n\nWe are also trying to be mindful of using electronics around/in front of her. In particular, no phones at the dinner table.\n\nAbout a week ago, I was preparing dinner with my Airpods in, and realized that I could continue listening to music/podcasts while I was watching her eat, to make it at least a little more interesting. The other day, I decided to stick my phone in the napkin holder on the table (so my daughter couldn't see it), and watch Netflix. I thought this was **genius**. I only have one Airpod in, so I can still hear everything she says, I still am keeping an eye on her, I'm still sitting in front of her looking... in her general direction. But I'm watching TV. Now instead of dreading dinner time, I'm fine with it.\n\nAnyway, yesterday, my wife came home, with my MIL and \"caught me\" watching TV. When she came in, I pointed to the Airpod, then to the phone, and gave a thumbs up, thinking she too would think I'm a genius.\n\nWell, my wife's not happy. I'm not sure if it's her, or if it's her mom (who was really not happy), but she thinks I should be spending that time \"with\" my daughter. I think I am. I think my daughter is completely unaware that I am watching TV. So no harm, no foul. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669855567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9909l/aita_for_watching_tv_while_my_daughter_eats_dinner/", "score": 2340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s also for you to bond with the daughter. Even if she doesn\u2019t understand you yet, the words she hears you speak to her are subconsciously affecting her development.

You are the adult, and children pick up on everything around them. Just because you aren\u2019t eating too does not mean you shouldn\u2019t respect this as her meal time and make some effort to interact with her. The fact that you say she\u2019s talking to herself makes you seem too dense to understand how parenting works. \n\nShe would simply love hearing your voice, just because you are her father. Is she going to provide riveting conversation? Probably not.

You aren't encouraging her to eat, you aren't talking about the food, or really doing anything.  You are teaching her that dinner time is quiet time.  You could be reading to her during that time.

I think a bit of independence learning to eat/pace themselves is a good thing.  Sometimes there's fancy dinner time when everyone eats at the table, sometimes you have to just poke at your fork and talk to the microwave for a little bit.  I mean, at some point, you need to curtail dinner time - you can't just play with your food forever, but it doesn't sound like you're allowing that either.    \n\n\nI'd be more worried about her noticing you not paying attention to her and paying attention to the napkins just because kids are super attentive - not because you're necessarily doing anything wrong.", "NTA", "NTA", "I'm going with NAH because I'd probably be doing a similar thing, though it be more doing domestic work in the same room instead of the tv show.\n\nWhen kids are young and your actually feeding them it's a whole lot different then when they can feed themselves.

My daughter is a super slow eater also. However, your wife clearly doesn\u2019t like this plan, so you should find a way to handle it that you both agree on. Or at least that she doesn\u2019t hate. \n\nWe would sit with my daughter for 20-30 minutes and then get up. We\u2019d stay nearby but maybe clean up or something. We told her it was healthy to eat slowly and she was doing a great job and could sit for as long as she wanted, but we had to start getting ready for bedtime (or whatever excuse).

Yes, these times at this age are priceless and will go by too fast. Blink and she will be 16.

You're supposed to just sit there and stare at the child while she blathers, recites ABCs and smashes her food into the plate?

It\u2019s why in the old days parents used to hand feed them - to speed up the meal and keep things cleaner. In some parts of the world people still do this. In the west letting toddlers feed themselves is currently the practice. But honestly a lot of parents are busy while their toddlers eat - especially if they have other children. Since you spend a lot of time with your child I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to do something while she eats.

They like hearing their own voice and it's ok for them to discover that by themselves, as a parent you don't have to hold their hand every step of the way.

One of you just sitting there while the toddler chats with her reflection isn't teaching anything.", "While I have no issue with anyone eating at any time they see fit, I do wonder what percent of adults are able to eat dinner at 5PM since that would often conflict with work and commute times.\n\nI tend to eat when it gets dark so that changes throughout the year.", "Oh yeah that\u2019s a great point!", "YTA.\n\nEating is about socializing as well as food. I know that a two year old's language skills won't lead to sophisticated discussions of current events, but you have to start somewhere. \n\nTurn off the TV. Read her a story. Listen to her sing \"Baby s'ark doo doo doo\" a hundred times. Line up her peas and count them. Ask her if she has wings. You know, engage with her. You can catch up on the news anytime. You can't catch up on missed time with a little kid.", "YTA. Your daughter knows you are ignoring her, kids are excellent at picking up on things like this. You're TA to your wife as well. You and your wife agreed on a rule about electronics and the first thing you did was break that agreement.\n\nAll in one go, you disrespected her, broke an agreement the two of you made, and now she knows she can't trust you to keep your word or have her back as a teammate when you are parenting.", "YTA\n\nI sympathise but you're wrong that your daughter 'is completely unaware'. She might not know what your electronics are but she's reading your expressions and body language. They learn incredibly fast at that age and I guarantee that she's learning that daddy isn't interested and doesn't engage with her whilst mommy does.", "Sooo.... I guess when your child is teenager she can bring her phone hidden in the napkin holder because your conversations sounds blathering nonsense to her. Don't make rules which you can't keep.", "YTA\n\nKid's 2. She notices when you're actively disengaged, and looking at a screen.", "YTA - you are so addicted to external stimuli that you can't manage 30 minutes with your child? You already stated that you are doing other things while preparing dinner, and now you also need something to occupy you while eating?\n\nRemember - multitasking is a myth, you are at best task-switching.\n\nMaybe it is because my kids were born before smartphones or streaming video, but when they were little and I came home from work I would enjoy the time. They develop so quickly and you can never get those moments back, unlike some stupid podcast or Netflix show.", "Yep YTA. Feeding kids is prime bonding and teaching time. You are missing out here and teaching your daughter she is not as important as your TV show. Drop the pods and talk to your daughter. Time to grow up and be a full time father.", "YTA. You and your wife agreed on no devices at the table. Try having something to eat with your daughter for you know, family meal time, and have a conversation with her (now is a great time to start treating her like a person with a brain). This is the age and time to teach table manners, and how to have a meal as a family and discuss your days. Engage with your child.", "INFO: why don't you eat *with* your kid? The ritual of eating together is one of the oldest in human history... if we want to talk about just modern times, eating together w your child(ren) helps foster good eating habits, less picky eaters, and helps build vocabulary. Why would you purposely miss out on this wonderful opportunity to bond w your kid? The daily routines- feeding, diapering/hygiene, and sleep (I call them the 3 Bs- bottles, butts and beds) are the foundation for building relationships w the tiny humans. I just don't get why you'd want to miss out on that.", "Soft YTA. I feel your pain so much. And I have done similar with my own kids. They eat so slow and I go crazy. But essentially removing your attention from them is not productive either.  Your kid sees meal time as quality time with you even though she already has a lot of it, she\u2019s learning media and your phone are more interesting than her sometimes. And soon she will expect her own phone to distract her at the dinner table. \n\nWhat about listening to music together? Having songs/music you enjoy. Or maybe reading out loud an adult book (but not too vulgar), even if she doesn\u2019t understand what the book is about, it\u2019s still good for her brain to hear you talking.  Or maybe take the time to work on a craft or something at the table? A rubix cube? Something to keep your hands and/or mind slightly occupied but still be there with her. Something you wouldn\u2019t find rude if a friend was doing while you were out to dinner together.", "Maybe you could, I dunno, interact with your daughter as she eats, to get her used to the concept of table conversation?\n\nYou have a job to teach her how to be a functional human. That doesn't just magically happen.", "Gentle YTA . I get that it's boring, i truly do, but you should really be eating dinner with her if possible - not watching her eat by herself anyway. Family meals are super important. However, I get that life is hectic and sometimes we just need a break so as long as you're making sure she's not choking it's not the end of the world if you're on your phone. It's just not ideal.", "YTA. I had a dad like you. he loved me, I'm sure of that. but I became interesting to him only when I hit my twenties. you can be 100% sure that I noticed he was absolutely not interested in me before I could hold a conversation instead of \"blabbering nonsense\" as you say. your daughter sees everything you do. she sees you are not interacting with her at all, that you're just biding your time until you can do something that's more interesting to you. she sees it. she feels it. and she will remember it.", "YTA. Dinner time is for family bonding, not tv", "OP, I know it's boring. I am a teacher, I teach high school, I have friends who teach elementary, and if you don't believe me on what I am about to say you can hop over to the r/teacher sub and find plenty of posts that confirm this. \n\nYou need to interact with your child, put the phone down. Teachers at the elementary hear from their students and get assignments from students where students say things like they wanted to spend time with their parents, but their parents were just sitting on their phones and refused to read them a story, play a game with them or listen to them about their day. Your child wants to interact with you, it may not be entertaining to you, but it's not about you, it's about them. Be a parent, sit at the table with your child, and pretend to talk to them, model how to have a conversation at the table without your phones. \n\nThink about when your toddler is a teenager, how do you want them to behave at the table. Do you want them putting in airpods and putting their phone in the napkin holder when you want to hear about school and their friends? Or do you want them to engage in a conversation with you? If you listen now, and model how to behave now, it sets the tone for later. \n\nNo judgement, just advice. Don't let your kid be one of the kids telling their teacher they wanted to spend time with you, but you were scrolling on your phone instead.", "This is a book end, at the other end of all the books you will write is the one where your daughter stares at her phone while you attempt to connect with her. \n\nIf you are fine with this N A H, but I\u2019m betting it will shake out more to YTA to yourself.", "Make a little plate with the same food and eat with her. She\u2019ll be encouraged to eat new foods she sees you eating and it will be a nice bonding time. Talk about what she is eating, is it crunchy, soft, sweet, salty, hot, cold. What color is it? What things are the same color. It will be mostly you talking and answering yourself. It\u2019s only dreadful and boring if you let it be. Spend some time with her while she\u2019ll still let you.", "INFO: Why is your child eating alone????", "Urgh, YTA since you\u2019re asking. \nDo you also watch your phone while your other moments with her ?", "You suck.  \n\nMealtime is an important interaction with parent time.  They learn more than how to get food in, they learn table manners, they learn to talk. They learn about the world.  \n\nNext meal, get a book  and read it to her. Ask her questions. Put on some nice music.  Disney tunes.  \n\nYou are not raising a child, you are raising a person. \nBy ignoring her, you are telling her she is not worthy of your time. \n\nYou suck.", "YTA. You\u2019re supposed to be *interacting* with your daughter, not just making sure she doesn\u2019t die. *That* is why the \u201cno phones at the dinner table\u201d rule matters. \n\nI\u2019m soooo sorry that you find parenting your kid boring. Maybe you should have thought of that before you had a kid?", "Soft YTA. I understand eating dinner with a two year May not be the most exciting thing, but this is part of having a kid. And being her dad, this is a big piece of quality time which I think is important. Being present is so important especially as she gets older. Kids will notice if you aren't being present or half listening because you're watching tv or doing something else. You should try to use the 30 minutes (which is not really that long) to talk WITH her or engage in whatever she's doing.", "Yeah, YTA ever so slightly.. I completely empathize with wanting to occupy the brain a bit, but it's a slippery slope toward being disengaged more often, or continuing to be disengaged at the table as your kid grows up. I would also argue at 2 years old, there's lot of interaction that can potentially happen at the table.", "I\u2019ll probably get hate for this but here it is. YTA as a daycare teacher when kids just fool around at the table and aren\u2019t eating and aren\u2019t using utensils correctly or at all it is frustrating. Having 7-9 2 year olds all just babbling and not eating is a nightmare. OP you should really be eating with her and modeling the behavior that is appropriate when at the table for meals. Put music on in the background if it\u2019s too quiet, music is stimulating for children! You had an agreement with your wife about electronics at the table and you broke it even if your daughter doesn\u2019t notice. That\u2019s why she\u2019s upset because you agreed to doing it one way and you changed that because you\u2019re bored. YTA as other have said having dinner together and talking as a family is super important for children.", "YTA - But it's not really as much that you're an asshole as you're wrong. I know it's boring and it sounds like you're a good parent who values time with your kid, but it's important to engage with your kid at mealtime and establish meal times as family time. I understand it's probably boring but I think your wife is right.", "YTA.  It is not your 2 year old child's responsibility to entertain you.   If watching her eat is \"boring\", then find some way to interact with her during the meal that is interesting.  Read her a story.  Make up a story.  Listen to music that she likes.   Count. Talk about puppies.   It's half an hour per day, Dude.   Buck up.", "I agree I worked in a daycare with kids OPS daughters age and they encouraged us to talk to the children while eating because studies show that the more parents and family members talk to children in their first few years the smarter, and more sociable they become, it can even be something as simple as narrating what you're doing.", "Agreed the early years of development for children are crucial. hearing her father's voice and him socializing with his 2 yr old are part of the bounding process. when I was growing up we didn't have cell phones or Netflix. sitting down with your daughter now no tv, phone, tablet, etc. will teach her further down the line that dinner time is socializing time.(not stare at the phone time). dinner time at my house was set aside as the time to ask how work, school and your day was.", "You\u2019re so right.\n\nOur toddler went from amazing eater to throwing shit everywhere and barely eating.\n\nWe were always with him at dinner time but never ate with him because 5pm is so early.\n\nWe started having a small plate of food or even just pretending to eat and all of a sudden he was interested in food again and ate like a horse.\nHe still occasionally throws food but meal times are much better and it\u2019s such a great time to chat about his day and for him to see my husband and I interacting over the table.", "The dude is a present father in every other aspect of parenting. I would also argue being available and at the table, while maybe not watching every pea go down there gullet is being present too. \n\nThese Y T A verdicts are a little wild to me. It sounds more like he found a way to recharge a little while his direct involvement in what the daughter is doing isn't required.", "Exactly, the point about microcosm is so true. Every moment is make or break seemingly", "She's also 2, you don't need to have quality time every minute of the day", "But they can socialize with each other at meal times. Leaving a 2 yr old to entertain themselves during a meal is definitely not neglect it just isn\u2019t setting them up for the best habits. I eat with my toddler most of the time and we talk.", "I doubt he\u2019s fully engulfed in Netflix. While I think dinner should be a time for conversation, there\u2019s no harm in occasionally multi tasking with Netflix too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue unless it\u2019s every dinner and he\u2019s also not paying attention to his daughter.", "This comment needs to be higher up.", "Let's flip the genders again. Would you say to a father who disagrees with his wife's parenting decision that he should spend less time controlling her and more time thankful that his wife is an engaged and involved mother who loves the child? Isn't that the bare minimum a parent should be?\n\nOther than that I agree with you that OP is NTA.", "His words were that he kept only one ear bud to listen for choking and messes. It had nothing to do with interacting in any way. That\u2019s not actively paying attention to her.", "One thing they don't tell you about parenting is that toddlers are excruciatingly slow at EVERYTHING. I'm an impatient person & my kids' toddler years nearly killed me with boredom. I used to do some of the things mentioned above -play music, dance around, talk about the food, sing, etc. I was always tired and irritable by that time of the day, so I made myself an upbeat playlist to improve my mood. Get creative, OP!  \n\n\nETA I guess you already did get creative. Keep being creative then!", "My daughter eats her dinner at my desk while I work, and I\u2019m always having to tell her to stop playing and when I finally look over at her after concentrating on work all I see is a mess. \ud83d\ude29\nLove the kid but she annoys me with her eating habits because she loses interest and then starts touching her food with her hands.", "Great I don't so we are even I guess!\n\nA 1 on 1 dinner with a 2 year old is not \"a social event\". It is them babbling while stuffing peas in their mouth for 30 mins. Babling back is the opposite of what you should be doing if you want them to develop their speech skills properly BTW.", "I FORGOT ABOUT THAT ONE, reddit is dumb, I think I am leaving for the day, lol", "You don't need to be \"actively\" doing it. You can just regular pay attention to her. She's just talking to herself. And who says he's not responding in any way? All mom wants him to do is sit and stare at her eat. What would be better if he would eat with her, or they wait till mom came home and did family dinner.", "Dude I don\u2019t like eating at 5 either. I like eating dinner at 9. I don\u2019t think you need to change that for your kid.", "Yeah that's not normal or healthy. I'm sorry", ">Laurie Berkner\n\nI had never heard of her so I just looked her up. Those songs/videos are adorable and not nearly as annoying as some of the other kids songs.", "100% this. They're humans and need to be able to do things on their own. I don't admonish OP at all. He's still there. He's still attentive. It's just at this stage, eating takes a while. Plus, as a parent, I have to work full time and take care of my son. So I'll take any form of adult entertainment when I can, even if it's for like 2 minutes. Hanging with a 5 year old all day is fun but I'm 41. My brain doesn't compute like it used to lol.", "Yes. I think it\u2019s a bit of a cultural thing too. I live in France, people here eat as a family, starting when the child is introduced to solids, because it\u2019s the most important family moment of the day. It\u2019s also a way to let the child discover ingredients and new recipes because they get to try what the rest of the family is having. And it reduces the boredom problem which, to be honest, can happen especially if the parent is a bit tired.", "I've always enjoyed that concept but kinda thought it was mostly a fictional creation unless you actually had things in common with your family members. If you didn't it just didn't happen.\n\nYeah, my dad doesn't talk to us or show any interest in what we like. Didn't even when we were in school, let alone now as a pair of young adults who can't afford to move out. It's only ever a few 5 minute conversations at random bursts and otherwise just vague house interactions. \n\nMum isn't amazing at dinner table conversation either due to the lack of shared interests thing, but generally wants to know how we're doing every single day (I have married parents who've always been together, for context. And since my younger brother and I still live at home we talk to her a lot.) She's more willing to talk to us about current affairs but mostly just talks to my dad and reserves chats with us for random other moments in the day\n\nThat might be related to my dad hating me and my brother talking about things he's not interested in at the table, while still not wanting to talk to us (or even about himself), but again, separate issue.", "Yeah, that worked before we were both working from home and share constantly. We also engage with our kid when she gets off the bus, and the little one throughout the day, so there\u2019s a lot of time. At mealtimes we sometimes do shared meals, and other times let the kids watch edutainment while the adults talk about the news.", "My family has certain shows we watch together during dinner. Usually cooking competition shows (Hell's Kitchen, Worst Cooks, etc). All of us in the living room eating and talking the whole time. We literally *only* sit at a table on holidays and it's way weirder for us! But I know plenty of articles and people would say that we shouldn't have the screen on. I don't get why. It's a shared interest and we aren't sitting in silence or some Matilda-like TV dinner zone-out. We're fully interactive with each other, more than most other times because the kids have such busy lives (*6* cheer squads between the 2 teenage girls)! It's our quality time and it's one thing we absolutely ALWAYS make time to do together. 6-7 days a week.", "Wait til you reread the post and find out the mom wasn't even at the house through most of the dinner.  She must be an awful parent, right?", "Awe that's shitty. I think being raised that way made me enjoy getting to know people as individuals instead of just focusing on how they can entertain me. It also makes relationships so much stronger and healthier. \n\nHopefully if you decide to start a family.of your own, you'll be able to enjoy dinner chats with your own kids.", "> Should I then disregard most judgements here given that they tend to be from American centric view point? \n\nThis is a common complaint on this sub when people from different cultures and countries come here and the replies are only from an American viewpoint.\n\nYou will not get the same responses here then you would in India, or Sweden, or South Africa.\n\nYou keep trying to throw out gotchas and utterly failing. Many people disregard the American view point as they find it individualistic, selfish, etc. In comparison to their beliefs.", "That's both something I don't want and can't really afford to have if I did. (Childfree and disabled with a debilitating genetic condition that can do especially terrifying or even life ending things around pregnancy and childbirth.)\n\nHowever I like talking to my partner during meals and we talk to our nieces and nephew when we have meals with them. Although it's definitely really easy to fall back into familiar patterns of only being on your phone, watching videos or reading while eating after we both grew up with physically or emotionally absent parents respectively.", "Actually, that\u2019s not my point. In my comment history I\u2019m typically arguing for people against the American view especially when it comes to wording and verbiage because people here take shit too literal.\n\nMy point is that many on this sub is fine recognizing every type of biases in judgements. There\u2019s no issue in calling out thing like American, thinking someone white, linguistics, and etc\u2026but the one issue that always angers people on this sub is the mention of a possible gender bias. When is it a valid point for some posts."]}
