I normally stay at home with him while my wife (26f) works. Im currently looking for a job as I hated my old job. I\u2019ve been a stay at home dad for 5months now. I love spending time with my son but it feels like im gonna explode sometimes cause I have to do cooking,cleaning,laundry,change diapers,entertain my son while dealing with his temper tantrums.\n\nFew days ago my wife was at work while I was at home, I was so stressed. The baby was fussy and he wouldn\u2019t go to sleep cause he wants his mama. I put him in his play mat while I went in the kitchen to cool off. I remember coming home to my wife doing this and I had no problem as it was normal. I was calming down when my wife walked in and could hear our son crying in the living room. She asked me why I\u2019m not with him and I said I needed to cool off. She made out as if I was the one that locked him in a room for hours when it was only 10 minutes. She yelled at me for being a \u201cbad father\u201d and not calming him down properly. I tried everything with him, rocking him to sleep, laying him down on my chest, feed him, put on baby shows, play with his toys nothing worked. I told her to fuck off and took our son upstairs.\nShe\u2019s been telling family members how I left him in the room and that I swore at her, does she expect me to hold it all in.  \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1669148764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z23z8m/aita_for_leaving_my_baby_in_a_another_room/", "score": 1381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes you need a little break. And when your kid is crying sometimes you need to step out of the situation for a few minutes and then you can handle the situation better. Experts give you that advise as well. Otherwise you might do things you will later regret, like accidentally shaking your baby because you are feeling helpless.\n\nMy baby had a bad start in life and then had some cramps. He was crying a lot. And I was sleeping for only 3 hours every 24 hours (not even 3 hours following each other, like half an hour then a few hours later again half an hour). We had a medical check up at the hospital (for the bad start in life). And we told the pediatrician about all the crying and asked for tips. She told us to sometimes leave the room (keep your baby safe and not lying around on the couch where it could fall off). But take a breath. And if we felt like throwing him out of the window we should immediately call them and they would take care of him for a night. Because with all the tension and sleep deprivation and crying you might do things you will regret. Like shake your baby just to make it stop crying. I never felt like shaking the baby and I could handle the months then but looking back I was a wreck and I cannot go there again. \n\nYou did the sane thing by stepping away from the situation and leaving your baby safe to give yourself a break. \n\nJust don\u2019t let your baby cry for too long. But sometimes you need to take care of yourself before you can take care of your baby.", "NTA it's not that you abandoned your baby in a mall. You were there, the baby wasn't in danger, and you just needed a handful of minutes to collect yourself. Your wife overreacted", "NTA- I've had 5 babies. It is perfectly OK to walk away. It's the best thing because a crying baby and your last sane nerve are not a good combo. Do I walk everywhere with a baby monitor. Nope. Do I need to? Nope. Next room over means I can still hear you crying your butt off. People need to stop judging and acting like that baby should be tied to your hip. We've let our kids cry it out. Check in them every couple of minutes. Try to sooth them. Heck I've even used ear plugs while holding my kids cause I felt like I wanted to throw them like a football to get away from me. Constant crying gets to you. You either find a way to get peace (ear olugs) or you walk away and keep trying. These babies don't come with subtitles we don't know what they want but we keep trying and taking a break within ear shot is fine. Tell Mother Teresa to enjoy the weekend shift alone and see how she handles the constant crying plus the house work. She can either be quiet or she could of walked in got a quick update from you then tried to calm the baby herself. You know like a good team player and a partner would do.", "NTA.

Mothers are always advised that when overwhelmed to put the baby in a safe place and put themselves in time out for a few minutes, I don\u2019t see why the advice would not also extend to fathers. \nIn fact, I would suspect that you are not aware of many of the things to help that are marketed towards mothers, to make life a little easier and to give you support. It can really be deeply overwhelming at times, especially if the baby is teething, growing, going through sleep regression or even just trying new foods and getting gassy. There are apps and books and local meetups, call numbers and fb groups all directed at raising a child of this age. \nWhile swearing at your wife was a dick move and you should apologize for that, you were not doing anything wrong by putting yourself in time out to gather your composure.", "NTA lol. It sounds like y'all are stressed but unless he is old enough to crawl to an outlet and lick it he is fine in a room while you catch your breath", "NTA. Doctors, nurses, family, friends, random people on the Internet, have always told me if you're getting frustrated, put the baby somewhere safe and take a moment away to collect yourself. Also 7 months has a lot of milestones that can cause baby to be extra emotional. A lot start teething really bad, overstimulate themselves with all the new things they can do, pretty sure there's a sleep regression then too. Mine didn't get teeth till a year old so I'm unsure if 7 months is still too young for that.

Your wife is a major AH.", "NTA.\n\nYou two should get couple's counseling asap. Your wife is misreading the situation, and you need time off to breathe.", "NTA. You did exactly what is recommended when you start to feel yourself losing it with a crying baby. Set the baby somewhere safe (crib would be better than a mat) and move to another room to get a break for a brief time. Ear plugs can make it easier to tolerate baby's crying. I'm sure it was disconcerting for your wife to walk in and realize the baby was crying in a different room, but you explained why that was and she'd also done it before so she knows that it's recommended.", "NTA\n\nYour wife managed to make herself look even worse in her own post. You're doing a great job. If any parent is horrible it's your wife for not allowing your baby to self-soothe which can really hurt his development.", "Would she had rather her come home to a dead baby?

Parents being so overwhelmed they just try to make it stop\u2026.just yell at the kid and shake him a little that\u2019ll shut it up\u2026.but you didn\u2019t. You placed in a safe fenced off area without dangers, and left to another room to cool down. Your wife is completely out of line and she needs to apologize and get her head out of her butt and realize that you did the best possible thing you could after trying everything short of killing or seriously harming your kid. I sound harsh and like I\u2019m jumping to the worst case scenario but it really is just that easy\u2026trust me, my mom deal with those types of horror everyday at work.", "NTA, especially if you made sure there was nothing lying around that your kid could hurt themself with. If you were only away for a few minutes with the baby in a perfectly safe place, that should be acceptable. You can't hover there 24/7, that's an unreasonable expectation, just make sure they're safe.\n\nGranted, you probably should have been more polite with how you interacted with your wife. It may have been an overreaction on her part, but it's her kid too, she has every right to be worried for their safety. A better way to approach this would be to sit down with her and lay down guidelines on what to do when you're home alone with the child, with a reasonable expectation being to clear any potential hazards from the room you have them in and being around enough to make sure that they're safe and to give them attention that they'll need to grow.", "NTA This is what you were meant to do.", "NTA.

It is obviously not a good thing to leave a baby crying, alone in a room, but you were overwhelmed. That can happen to anybody. Not too often, I hope! You and your wife need better communication.

You two need to support each other to be better parents, together and seperately.", "NTA.  If overwhelmed you are supposed to put your child in a safe place and walk away(obviously briefly and not actually leave) to cool down.  Children are very overwhelming and one can react poorly if upset.  Taking a moment to step away is a good choice in these situations.  \n\nI would sit with your wife and talk with her.  She is likely feeling swamped and may be battling her own stressors right now.  However, going and trashing you as a parent and partner isn't healthy for your marriage or family.  You two should invest in some counseling as effective communication is even MORE important when you have a child.", "NTA walking away is how shaken baby syndrome is prevented.

I yelled at him for not being there for the baby. Yes he deserves a break sometimes but not when the baby is crying. I noticed that the baby has been biting him. He wasn\u2019t answering me when I asked why is he not helping our son when he\u2019s had a break, I blurted out he\u2019s a bad father and immediately regretted it. He told me to fuck off and went upstairs with the baby. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong. He needs to be there for his son when he is clearly tired.

I\u2019d admit I\u2019ve never seen him cry that much infront of me before. I asked him what is he doing when the baby\u2019s crying. He said he\u2019s having a quick break. I yelled at him for not being there for the baby. Yes he deserves a break sometimes but not when the baby is crying. I noticed that the baby has been biting him. He wasn\u2019t answering me when I asked why is he not helping our son when he\u2019s had a break, I blurted out he\u2019s a bad father and immediately regretted it. He told me to fuck off and went upstairs with the baby. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong. He needs to be there for his son when he is clearly tired.
