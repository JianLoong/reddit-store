{"id": 11162, "submission_id": "11ej4ne", "title": "AITA for paying for my bio daughters wedding but not my step daughters because of how she acts and treats me?", "selftext": "For context: I (56M) have been married to my wife Lisa (57F) for 25 years. We have a daughter together April (24F) and Lisa has a daughter Carly (33F) with her ex husband Doug (60ish M). Lisa had divorced Doug when Carly was only 6/7 because he had addiction problems and refused to seek treatment for it and essentially couldn\u2019t hold down a job or help provide for their family.\n\nI met Lisa soon after and we got married and she had full custody of Carly so they both moved into my house at the time. I have always seen Carly as my own daughter and always wished to be an additional male figure in her life after her own father, but she always saw me as the man who replaced her dad and took them away from him. As someone who came from divorced parents myself, I completely understand why she felt this way and respected that she wanted space and boundaries from me so I never pushed anything beyond just a friendship between us and never forced a father/daughter relationship.\n\nWith this, I always tried my best to show up to her school events with her mom, paid for college, included her in all of my family\u2019s gatherings etc. But once Lisa and I had our first child April, Carly was extremely resentful of April and thought April was here to replace her the way I \u201creplaced\u201d her dad in her family. She would often bully April when they were kids and we had to put them both in therapy to finally work things out.\n\nNow they\u2019re both adults and have their own lives but Carly continues to take digs at April whenever she has the chance, compares herself to April, talks down to her etc, and now this is getting to their weddings. April got married last year and I paid for the whole thing as she is my daughter. Carly recently got engaged and I offered to help pay for the wedding (which she gladly accepted) and the planning was seemingly going well until she showed her mom the guest list and April and I were no where to be found.\n\nCarly said she didn\u2019t feel close enough with April and I to include us in her big day which I respect and understand. But she\u2019s not close enough to me to invite me to her wedding, yet she\u2019s okay enough with me to want me to fund the entire event? This is when I told her I won\u2019t be paying for it anymore and it\u2019s become a huge issue that I\u2019m \u201ctreating her like she isn\u2019t my daughter, showing favoritism to April, it\u2019s not fair\u201d etc. I have done nothing but try to build a relationship with her for 25 years, but she clearly doesn\u2019t want one except for when I\u2019m financially benefiting her. I didn\u2019t mind this when she was a kid because it was my responsibility to provide for her, but I\u2019m just so sick of this now that she\u2019s older.\n\nAITA for paying for April\u2019s wedding but not Carly\u2019s?", "created_utc": 1677616412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ej4ne/aita_for_paying_for_my_bio_daughters_wedding_but/", "score": 592, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t give in and pay. You\u2019re just an ATM to Carly. She doesn\u2019t have any respect for you. I can\u2019t believe the nerve of her to expect you to foot the bill, yet you don\u2019t get invited. Yes, she doesn\u2019t have to have a relationship with you or April, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be taken advantage of. \n\nLet her know that you understand you two don\u2019t have a relationship because she never wanted one and you completely respect that. However, that goes for your money too. The petty person in me would tell her to go ask her own father for money for her wedding.\n\nEdit: Adding a question: Where is your wife in all this? Does she approve of Carly\u2019s behavior? Is she pressuring you to pay?", "Nta\n\nShe doesn't have a relationship with you. Not enough of one to even invite you to the wedding? Yeah, that's a no. She can fund it herself. I have to wonder what the wife thinks of this?", "NTA.  How is this even a question?  You are a saint to put up with her crap all this time and not doing anything sooner.", "NTA. Strip away all the other details: The person paying for the wedding certainly gets to attend. \n\nIf Carly is so uncomfortable with your presence, then why should she be surrounded by things you paid for? She and her fiance will figure it out.", "NTA. If April didn\u2019t invite you to her wedding you wouldn\u2019t have paid for it either.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't see you as her father or a father figure so why would she want you to pay for the wedding. She can't have it both ways.", "NTA wth!!! You paid for her entire college education?! That alone is amazing and you are an awesome step father. I got a grand total of $0 from my parents. When it came time to get my first car they offered to sell me their old car at the same amount they were going to sell it on kijiji...The fact that she's acted the way she has with all that opertunity is insanity. Not only that but to have you pay for the wedding and not invite her sister or you her amazingly supportive step father? That's absurd. I would not give a dime even if I got the invite at this point.", "Definitely, NTA. It's absurd for you to pay for a wedding you're excluded from. She's 33 years old, I'd be done with her altogether. The entitlement, just wow. You've gone above and beyond for her and this is the thanks you get, smh.", "NTA....I don't understand....you're not close enough to be invited to her wedding...cool! Accepted!!! BUT YOU ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO FUND HER COLLEGE AND PROVIDE FOR HER SINCE SHE WAS 6/7???? I think YOU need to realize you're never going to be anything than a bank to her! & your daughter NO MATTER HER AGE her punching bag! How your wife would allow this continue for decades is beyond me! She's grown now! Enough to decide who she wants in her life...but she can't also decide how those she rejects spends their money", "You're not just an ATM, although that seems to be what she thinks. \n\nIf she doesn't want to treat you like you are her dad you have no obligation to treat her like your daughter. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you aren't good enough to be at the wedding, but she finds your money just dandy enough to spend. Yeah, no.  She's accusing you of not treating her like your daughter all the while she's not treating you like you've taken care of her all these years.", "NTA \n\nShe's thirty-three years old. I'm trying to figure out when she's ready to grow up. \n\nAnyway, she's using you for money and that's the end of it. Please hold your ground.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't treat you as a father, so why should she expect you to treat her as a daughter? Asking her to include YOU AND HER SISTER IN THE WEDDING SHE WANTED YOU TO PAY FOR is ballsy.

Also, not everyone has the privilege of having any form of a parental figure that is ready to offer nearly as much. Kudos to you for sticking it out and being around for her for this long. Though you should be getting this appreciation from Carly, not from Reddit, we can at least offer something.", "If you aren't welcome, then your money obviously isn't needed. NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe has some serious balls to accept your money and turn you away. I normally would default to YTA in these types of posts because I believe you treat stepkids as your own, but you tried that and she resents you. Ok, fair enough, she doesn't want that relationship. But you offered to pay, which was generous, and she said yes please. If she never planned to invite you or April, there is no rational way she should have accepted your money. She has no character.", "NTA!! And honestly even if she \u201cchange\u201d her mind all the sudden I wouldn\u2019t pay. She is only doing that to get your money.. what\u2019s to say she uninvited you both when your done paying her stuff.. don\u2019t let your wife bully you into paying.

You have a wife problem. Also, I don\u2019t like ultimatums but this is certainly one of those times where she needs to make a choice", "NTA. And the therapy didn't work.

Tell her to go find another Atm.", "You\u2019ve been her stepdad and stepsister for 20+ years and she doesn\u2019t invite you to her wedding? That \u2018s cold! NTA although I wonder what her reasons are for doing something so extreme.\n\nEdit to ask: how does your wife feel about this? Is she okay going to her daughters wedding all by herself?", "NTA. She can\u2019t not invite you and expect anything grandiose. You wanted to treat her like a daughter, she won\u2019t even treat you like a friend.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a huge social faux pas to expect wedding gifts from people who aren't invited, let alone *not inviting the person who is bankrolling the damn wedding*.

Sounds like it's time to accept that Carly does not consider you her family, and to relinquish any feeling of responsibility you have towards her.

You don't have to walk her down the isle, or have a daddy/daughter dance, or do any of the traditional father of the bride things, but simply attending as her mother's date if nothing else. The audacity is wild to me, to say you aren't close enough to invite but thanks for the money. It's also just weird that she wouldn't invite her half sister, close or not, it's her sister for the last 25 years.....if April chooses not to go because they aren't close that's one thing but to not even be invited.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nFor context: I (56M) have been married to my wife Lisa (57F) for 25 years. We have a daughter together April (24F) and Lisa has a daughter Carly (33F) with her ex husband Doug (60ish M). Lisa had divorced Doug when Carly was only 6/7 because he had addiction problems and refused to seek treatment for it and essentially couldn\u2019t hold down a job or help provide for their family.\n\nI met Lisa soon after and we got married and she had full custody of Carly so they both moved into my house at the time. I have always seen Carly as my own daughter and always wished to be an additional male figure in her life after her own father, but she always saw me as the man who replaced her dad and took them away from him. As someone who came from divorced parents myself, I completely understand why she felt this way and respected that she wanted space and boundaries from me so I never pushed anything beyond just a friendship between us and never forced a father/daughter relationship.\n\nWith this, I always tried my best to show up to her school events with her mom, paid for college, included her in all of my family\u2019s gatherings etc. But once Lisa and I had our first child April, Carly was extremely resentful of April and thought April was here to replace her the way I \u201creplaced\u201d her dad in her family. She would often bully April when they were kids and we had to put them both in therapy to finally work things out.\n\nNow they\u2019re both adults and have their own lives but Carly continues to take digs at April whenever she has the chance, compares herself to April, talks down to her etc, and now this is getting to their weddings. April got married last year and I paid for the whole thing as she is my daughter. Carly recently got engaged and I offered to help pay for the wedding, and the planning was seemingly going well until she showed her mom the guest list and April and I were no where to be found.\n\nCarly said she didn\u2019t feel close enough with April and I to include us in her big day which I respect and understand. So she\u2019s not close enough to me to invite me to her wedding, but she\u2019s okay enough with me to want me to fund the entire event? This is when I told her I won\u2019t be paying for it anymore and it\u2019s become a huge issue that I\u2019m \u201ctreating her like she isn\u2019t my daughter, showing favoritism to April, it\u2019s not fair\u201d etc. I have done nothing but try to build a relationship with her for 25 years, but she clearly doesn\u2019t want one except for when I\u2019m financially benefiting her. I didn\u2019t mind this when she was a kid because it was my responsibility to provide for her, but I\u2019m just so sick of this now that she\u2019s older.\n\nAITA for paying for April\u2019s wedding but not Carly\u2019s?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Completely sever her relationship with her own daughter?    \n\nCarly is an adult now, her Mom can\u2019t make her do or feel anything.  You don\u2019t even know what she\u2019s tried up until now!", "Uh, if I showed up to Christmas with gifts and the hosts said I wasn't allowed in the house to celebrate with them, fuck yeah I'd take my gifts back. Whatever analogy you were trying to make, you failed.", "Those people are the clowns I\u2019m speaking of.", "We don\u2019t stop loving our children just because our children are having a tough time of things. It is doubly complex with step parents and step children. \n\nBeing a product of divorced parents and having step parents myself, I understand a little of this. Having kids myself (no step kids) I understand a little more. Being involved as an uncle/BIL in some pretty complex dynamics with my SIL and BIL who are now a big family of step kids from both previous marriages, I can see yet a little more.\n\nIt\u2019s easy enough to sit behind your keyboard and throw stones. Got it. That\u2019s where you are, it\u2019s where we are in AITA, throw them stones.\n\nForgive me for showing some empathy and actual interest in the OP\u2019s dilemma. I\u2019m not going to scream get divorced or disown her! Like the crowds often do. \n\nReal life, this is a far more delicate and complex issue. \u201cDo you actually blame your wife for her wanting to see her daughter have a nice wedding? How could I, it is her daughter?\u201d Competes with \u201cCarly is hurting me, shouldn\u2019t I/how much should I expect her to abandon her daughter\u2019s desires in my defense?\u201d Competes with \u201cAm I ready to give up on Carly, after trying so hard, and loving her as a daughter myself?

Stop picking on April!\u201d Competes with \u201cMy finances don\u2019t (or do) get affected much by this anyway, is it worth the fight?\u201d\u2026\u2026..And on and on.", "No but she can put her daughter in her place. She is too old to be acting like this. The wife never should have allowed her to act like this all these years.", "No she cant but she can set expectations. Like \u2018you cant expect my husband to pay for your wedding when you treat him like shit and dont invite him\u2019. She doesn\u2019t get to play the daughter card.", "Well, maybe she will loose her 2nd daughter who had the audacity to be born over this.", "Did I say you weren\u2019t let in??? Go back and read what I said\u2026. You give known assholes a gift, they don\u2019t reciprocate, and then what do you do? Whatever you do, they were known assholes so you\u2019re an idiot for bringing anything to begin with and also for expecting anything in return.", "Absolutely idiotic take", "They never had a father daughter relationship he tried she didn\u2019t want that. Even after all that he still stepped up and paid for her college.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a 18 year old kid. This is 33 year old woman. She has every right to not want to invite him. \n\nBut if she doesn\u2019t want even a friendship with him then she should be ashamed to spend his money. He doesn\u2019t have a father/daughter relationship with her. He doesn\u2019t even have a friendship with her. He has a banking relationship with her and like all other banking transactions he can choose how and when to spend his money.\n\nI would be with you if he was making demands like walking her down the aisle or a father/daughter dance. He isn\u2019t. He simply ask to escort her mother or be her mothers date. \n\nSo no she doesn\u2019t have the right to his money.  Quite frankly her and her mother should be ashamed to even ask him for the money.\n\n\nAnd you can\u2019t disown someone that clearly has already disowned you. So no she should get his money now or when he dies. It should all go to his daughter. \n\nAs far as I am concerned her and her mother are nothing more than gold diggers.\n\nAnd the only empathy I feel is for op who has done nothing but try and his daughter who\u2019s only sin was being born. Can you imagine how his daughter feels knowing her sister hates you so much she doesn\u2019t want you at the wedding and your mother is encouraging it and always had.", "If mom cared about her daughter she would have raised her to pay for the things in life she wants for herself and not depend on your half- sisters father your whole life.

She told OP she supports his withdrawal.  OP says the wife is still going\u2014he didn\u2019t say she never said anything to Carly over it.", "Who says the wife\u2019s sacrificed anything for April because of Carly, or doesn\u2019t stick up for her?

She had trouble reciprocating, sure, doesn\u2019t negate how he views it.\n\nI\u2019m not saying I disagree with you. On the surface, yup, she should be ashamed to even want his money.\n\nI\u2019m simply saying that he\u2019s been in a marriage for about 25 years and they\u2019ve been making this work, somehow, all this time. So the dynamics are obviously a bit more complex than people are acknowledging when they toss out \u201cDivorce her and never speak to Carly or your wife again!\u201d tripe.", "Because if your kid is still an A H after therapy you need to be a parent and put them in their place ESPECIALLY if they're an adult also.", "He offered to pay for the wedding before he found out the guest list. They had gone through the planning process. Guests lists are one of the last things you do in wedding prep. \n\nI am not saying that anyone who puts up boundaries after being treated badly is an idiot. You really don\u2019t read what I post yet try to nail me on some made up shit. You can\u2019t expect an asshole to not be an asshole. If you expect that, you\u2019re an idiot. If you give a gift with the condition of reciprocation you\u2019re an asshole. Plain and simple. I stated they were both assholes. Him for offering to pay and having conditions on the payment. And her for not inviting him. If he wanted to give them money (emphasis on wanted) he would have done it regardless.", "I agree leaving would be hard. But I see this as a very big slap in the face. I think the dynamic have worked so well because all this time her mom let the daughter treat him like a doormat and he took it. Now that he has grown a well deserved spine and put the checkbook away I don\u2019t think this dynamic is no longer going to work. You can only push someone away so many times before they leave. And sometimes you don\u2019t like the consequences when they do. I feel like op and his daughter deserve so much better treatment then the wive and step daughter give. Them"]}
