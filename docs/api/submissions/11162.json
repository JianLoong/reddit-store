{"id": 11162, "submission_id": "11ej4ne", "title": "AITA for paying for my bio daughters wedding but not my step daughters because of how she acts and treats me?", "selftext": "For context: I (56M) have been married to my wife Lisa (57F) for 25 years. We have a daughter together April (24F) and Lisa has a daughter Carly (33F) with her ex husband Doug (60ish M). Lisa had divorced Doug when Carly was only 6/7 because he had addiction problems and refused to seek treatment for it and essentially couldn\u2019t hold down a job or help provide for their family.\n\nI met Lisa soon after and we got married and she had full custody of Carly so they both moved into my house at the time. I have always seen Carly as my own daughter and always wished to be an additional male figure in her life after her own father, but she always saw me as the man who replaced her dad and took them away from him. As someone who came from divorced parents myself, I completely understand why she felt this way and respected that she wanted space and boundaries from me so I never pushed anything beyond just a friendship between us and never forced a father/daughter relationship.\n\nWith this, I always tried my best to show up to her school events with her mom, paid for college, included her in all of my family\u2019s gatherings etc. But once Lisa and I had our first child April, Carly was extremely resentful of April and thought April was here to replace her the way I \u201creplaced\u201d her dad in her family. She would often bully April when they were kids and we had to put them both in therapy to finally work things out.\n\nNow they\u2019re both adults and have their own lives but Carly continues to take digs at April whenever she has the chance, compares herself to April, talks down to her etc, and now this is getting to their weddings. April got married last year and I paid for the whole thing as she is my daughter. Carly recently got engaged and I offered to help pay for the wedding (which she gladly accepted) and the planning was seemingly going well until she showed her mom the guest list and April and I were no where to be found.\n\nCarly said she didn\u2019t feel close enough with April and I to include us in her big day which I respect and understand. But she\u2019s not close enough to me to invite me to her wedding, yet she\u2019s okay enough with me to want me to fund the entire event? This is when I told her I won\u2019t be paying for it anymore and it\u2019s become a huge issue that I\u2019m \u201ctreating her like she isn\u2019t my daughter, showing favoritism to April, it\u2019s not fair\u201d etc. I have done nothing but try to build a relationship with her for 25 years, but she clearly doesn\u2019t want one except for when I\u2019m financially benefiting her. I didn\u2019t mind this when she was a kid because it was my responsibility to provide for her, but I\u2019m just so sick of this now that she\u2019s older.\n\nAITA for paying for April\u2019s wedding but not Carly\u2019s?", "created_utc": 1677616412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ej4ne/aita_for_paying_for_my_bio_daughters_wedding_but/", "score": 9800, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t give in and pay. You\u2019re just an ATM to Carly. She doesn\u2019t have any respect for you. I can\u2019t believe the nerve of her to expect you to foot the bill, yet you don\u2019t get invited. Yes, she doesn\u2019t have to have a relationship with you or April, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be taken advantage of. \n\nLet her know that you understand you two don\u2019t have a relationship because she never wanted one and you completely respect that. However, that goes for your money too. The petty person in me would tell her to go ask her own father for money for her wedding.\n\nEdit: Adding a question: Where is your wife in all this? Does she approve of Carly\u2019s behavior? Is she pressuring you to pay?", "Nta\n\nShe doesn't have a relationship with you. Not enough of one to even invite you to the wedding? Yeah, that's a no. She can fund it herself. I have to wonder what the wife thinks of this?", "NTA.  How is this even a question?  You are a saint to put up with her crap all this time and not doing anything sooner.", "NTA. Strip away all the other details: The person paying for the wedding certainly gets to attend. \n\nIf Carly is so uncomfortable with your presence, then why should she be surrounded by things you paid for? She and her fiance will figure it out.", "NTA. If April didn\u2019t invite you to her wedding you wouldn\u2019t have paid for it either.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't see you as her father or a father figure so why would she want you to pay for the wedding. She can't have it both ways.", "NTA wth!!! You paid for her entire college education?! That alone is amazing and you are an awesome step father. I got a grand total of $0 from my parents. When it came time to get my first car they offered to sell me their old car at the same amount they were going to sell it on kijiji...The fact that she's acted the way she has with all that opertunity is insanity. Not only that but to have you pay for the wedding and not invite her sister or you her amazingly supportive step father? That's absurd. I would not give a dime even if I got the invite at this point.", "Definitely, NTA. It's absurd for you to pay for a wedding you're excluded from. She's 33 years old, I'd be done with her altogether. The entitlement, just wow. You've gone above and beyond for her and this is the thanks you get, smh.", "NTA....I don't understand....you're not close enough to be invited to her wedding...cool! Accepted!!! BUT YOU ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO FUND HER COLLEGE AND PROVIDE FOR HER SINCE SHE WAS 6/7???? I think YOU need to realize you're never going to be anything than a bank to her! & your daughter NO MATTER HER AGE her punching bag! How your wife would allow this continue for decades is beyond me! She's grown now! Enough to decide who she wants in her life...but she can't also decide how those she rejects spends their money", "You're not just an ATM, although that seems to be what she thinks. \n\nIf she doesn't want to treat you like you are her dad you have no obligation to treat her like your daughter. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you aren't good enough to be at the wedding, but she finds your money just dandy enough to spend. Yeah, no.  She's accusing you of not treating her like your daughter all the while she's not treating you like you've taken care of her all these years.", "NTA \n\nShe's thirty-three years old. I'm trying to figure out when she's ready to grow up. \n\nAnyway, she's using you for money and that's the end of it. Please hold your ground.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't treat you as a father, so why should she expect you to treat her as a daughter? Asking her to include YOU AND HER SISTER IN THE WEDDING SHE WANTED YOU TO PAY FOR is ballsy.

Also, not everyone has the privilege of having any form of a parental figure that is ready to offer nearly as much. Kudos to you for sticking it out and being around for her for this long. Though you should be getting this appreciation from Carly, not from Reddit, we can at least offer something.", "If you aren't welcome, then your money obviously isn't needed. NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe has some serious balls to accept your money and turn you away. I normally would default to YTA in these types of posts because I believe you treat stepkids as your own, but you tried that and she resents you. Ok, fair enough, she doesn't want that relationship. But you offered to pay, which was generous, and she said yes please. If she never planned to invite you or April, there is no rational way she should have accepted your money. She has no character.", "NTA!! And honestly even if she \u201cchange\u201d her mind all the sudden I wouldn\u2019t pay. She is only doing that to get your money.. what\u2019s to say she uninvited you both when your done paying her stuff.. don\u2019t let your wife bully you into paying.

You have a wife problem. Also, I don\u2019t like ultimatums but this is certainly one of those times where she needs to make a choice", "NTA. And the therapy didn't work.

Tell her to go find another Atm.", "You\u2019ve been her stepdad and stepsister for 20+ years and she doesn\u2019t invite you to her wedding? That \u2018s cold! NTA although I wonder what her reasons are for doing something so extreme.\n\nEdit to ask: how does your wife feel about this? Is she okay going to her daughters wedding all by herself?", "NTA. She can\u2019t not invite you and expect anything grandiose. You wanted to treat her like a daughter, she won\u2019t even treat you like a friend.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a huge social faux pas to expect wedding gifts from people who aren't invited, let alone *not inviting the person who is bankrolling the damn wedding*.

You don't have to walk her down the isle, or have a daddy/daughter dance, or do any of the traditional father of the bride things, but simply attending as her mother's date if nothing else. The audacity is wild to me, to say you aren't close enough to invite but thanks for the money. It's also just weird that she wouldn't invite her half sister, close or not, it's her sister for the last 25 years.....if April chooses not to go because they aren't close that's one thing but to not even be invited.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nFor context: I (56M) have been married to my wife Lisa (57F) for 25 years. We have a daughter together April (24F) and Lisa has a daughter Carly (33F) with her ex husband Doug (60ish M). Lisa had divorced Doug when Carly was only 6/7 because he had addiction problems and refused to seek treatment for it and essentially couldn\u2019t hold down a job or help provide for their family.\n\nI met Lisa soon after and we got married and she had full custody of Carly so they both moved into my house at the time. I have always seen Carly as my own daughter and always wished to be an additional male figure in her life after her own father, but she always saw me as the man who replaced her dad and took them away from him. As someone who came from divorced parents myself, I completely understand why she felt this way and respected that she wanted space and boundaries from me so I never pushed anything beyond just a friendship between us and never forced a father/daughter relationship.\n\nWith this, I always tried my best to show up to her school events with her mom, paid for college, included her in all of my family\u2019s gatherings etc. But once Lisa and I had our first child April, Carly was extremely resentful of April and thought April was here to replace her the way I \u201creplaced\u201d her dad in her family. She would often bully April when they were kids and we had to put them both in therapy to finally work things out.\n\nNow they\u2019re both adults and have their own lives but Carly continues to take digs at April whenever she has the chance, compares herself to April, talks down to her etc, and now this is getting to their weddings. April got married last year and I paid for the whole thing as she is my daughter. Carly recently got engaged and I offered to help pay for the wedding, and the planning was seemingly going well until she showed her mom the guest list and April and I were no where to be found.\n\nCarly said she didn\u2019t feel close enough with April and I to include us in her big day which I respect and understand. So she\u2019s not close enough to me to invite me to her wedding, but she\u2019s okay enough with me to want me to fund the entire event? This is when I told her I won\u2019t be paying for it anymore and it\u2019s become a huge issue that I\u2019m \u201ctreating her like she isn\u2019t my daughter, showing favoritism to April, it\u2019s not fair\u201d etc. I have done nothing but try to build a relationship with her for 25 years, but she clearly doesn\u2019t want one except for when I\u2019m financially benefiting her. I didn\u2019t mind this when she was a kid because it was my responsibility to provide for her, but I\u2019m just so sick of this now that she\u2019s older.\n\nAITA for paying for April\u2019s wedding but not Carly\u2019s?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She's making it clear that you aren't family, you are a wallet. \n\nAsk her why she thinks it is okay to ask someone she says she isn't close to to pay for her wedding. Would she ask the mailman to chip in, since that's what she's treating you like? Ask what her dad is doing for her. Finally, tell her that you didn't steal her mother, you met after she left Carly's dad, and that you've been trying to be a part of her family since you met. Since she doesn't want you to be her family, she doesn't now get to demand the privileges of family. \n\nThe reason I say to have the fianc\u00e9e there is because he/she should know what is going on so that you aren't painted as the wicked step-father.

If this blows up your marriage, it will be completely their fault. \n\nI think you need to take a long, hard look at what your *real* role in these women's lives is, and decide if this is what you want to spend the next 25 years dealing with, especially what might happen when it comes to end of life care etc. Because Carly will stick you in Shady Pines as fast as she can just to be cruel, if there's any chance it'll be left up to her. \n\nTo reiterate - what Carly has done here is cruel. Appalling. Vicious. AND DELIBERATE. That your wife hasn't come down hard on her for this is not acceptable either. \n\nPlease take a big step back, OP, take some time away from them if you can, and decide what you want. \n\nNTA.
