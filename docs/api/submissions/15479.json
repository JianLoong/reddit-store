Her stepdaughters are mid to late 20s now and her stepson is probably like 22. They have been in our lives for something like 18 years now but they never cared about our family and always made us aware of the fact they didn't want to be around us. I'm 24 so they have been around most of my life and they were introduced to me as my cousins and stuff when we met, but I never had a relationship like cousins with them. They never wanted to play with us. They used to throw some pretty epic tantrums when our family was invited to their birthday parties, they'd encourage their maternal and paternal cousins to ignore us at these parties and made a very big emphasis on family vs not family.\n\nI remember one Christmas the girls were teens, the boy was maybe 10 or 11 and my aunt and grandma wanted to help them add a patch to a family quilt my grandma had, that represented all members of the family (though me and younger grandchildren were not on there yet). They called my aunt and grandparents stupid and said they were not part of the family so why would they want to be on the dumb fucking quilt. My uncle (their dad) told them they were being rude and to apologize and when they wouldn't, they got sent to their rooms, but not before they said they didn't give a shit about us.\n\nI haven't seen these people in years now. They rejected invites to stuff, refused to come when they were older teens and generally just never wanted to be included.\n\nSo my brother is getting married this year and my aunt was upset to learn her stepkids were not on the guest list. My brother is the same age as her oldest stepkid and she said she would have figured a same age cousin would be on the list at least. My brother was taken aback by her comment and my mom (aunt's sister) told her that they weren't really cousins and that was a thing very much driven by her stepkids. My aunt was like that's not true, they're part of this family and all that stuff. She said nobody would ever imagine not inviting the rest and how we're important so why are her stepkids not. Mom said it was different and my aunt said they are just as much family as the rest of us and how could anyone think differently. I told her she was delusional to think those stepkids are a big deal to us like the rest of the family when they have always rejected us and always made it clear they did not want to be part of the family. I told her they might have been kids when they joined but now they are grown adults and we do not need to chase after them and kiss their asses. She was hurt and asked how we could all just stop caring like that and how could we tell her that when they're still her kids. My mom told her she had to understand we never got the chance to bond with them because they were rejecting us.\n\nMy aunt believes I was over harsh though and for that I ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1682239251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w1jpl/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_shes_delusional_to_think/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can't see the reality of the situation, because she sees you and them as family, and places a very high emphasis on that \"fact\", despite how much time and effort they have put into declaring that their step-family is not family.

But the fact that even after 20 years you all still talk about them as stepkids, makes you AH. If they were blood relatives but acted the same way, would it make a difference? It shouldn\u2019t matter that they were adopted, that\u2019s not the root of the problem here.

If a parent tries to integrate step kids into a family they OBVIOUSLY don\u2019t want to be a part of\u2026 everyone screams asshole and tells them they are controlling. Now you\u2019re saying the parents were AH\u2019s for not doing enough to force the relationship. They don\u2019t want the relationship. key work THEYYYYY.

Those step-cousins were definitely obnoxious, but it also seems like that was their only available reaction after being pressured into playing happy families.

You asked if insulting your aunt made you TA.  It does."]}
