Particularly, since I am assuming she is expecting OP to provide day of services, which means OP will be staffing the wedding and not enjoying it as a guest. \n\nBeing family is never an excuse to exploit someone, and it's more than okay to draw healthy boundaries and to push back when people are not respectful of your time or circumstances.

Don't torpedo your relationship with her or give anyone any ammunition to say you were out of line because doing this at the wedding would be.
