Your time is valuable and you sound like you have put a lot of effort into helping her with her wedding, she has offered you nothing in return at all actually when a wedding planner would normally be very expensive.  \n\nI think that is a lovely gift to give someone and if she is going to flip out on you for not getting her a material item then it shows how much she values you time.  What an ahole.  \n\nHere is the gift you should give her:  \n\nAdd up all your time and what you would charge a normal client.  \n\nPut it on an invoice.\n\nWrite \"free of charge because I love you\" next to the total charge.\n\nBuy a lovely wedding card and insert the invoice into the card. \n\nGive it to her.\n\nThen she will see exactly what you got her for her wedding which I expect will be a damn sight more than anyone else got her.\n\nThis has now made me angry and I am going to angrily boil the kettle and make tea like a proper English person would in this situation.", "NTA. While I would have maybe been clear up front that getting your services for free was the gift, your sister\u2019s level of entitlement is ridiculous.

I suggest you draw up a list of income and things that have cost you while doing her planning and show your family. Don\u2019t bother showing this list to her, she will only get more riled up. Instead, show this list to a more level-headed family member who can see from your point of view and let this family member or members advocate for you. Sometimes it takes a 3rd person to make her see the light.", "NTA. \nI'd back out now and leave her to deal with it all herself AND not get her a gift after this nonsense.", "NTA - your sister has some nerve.", "NTA, you\u2019re probably getting your entitled sister one of the most expensive gifts of the whole wedding. Seeing as you\u2018ve already done so much, dropping out now probably won\u2019t help you so I\u2018d definitely write her a bill and give her that together with a gift certificate covering that bill.

Tell her if she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a gift you\u2019re happy enough to cancel everything you\u2019ve organized and get her gift.

But honestly who are these people who are that entitled that they ask for a gift?!", "NTA - It was clear that this was your wedding gift, she's literally being greedy.\n\nIt's not worth falling out over, so I'd just buy the couple a $12 bottle of wine or something and be done with it.", "NTA...you literally lost time and money.

She clearly doesn't understand how much you're doing for her. \n\nI'd talk to your family and tell them fair square what you actually did for her and how she's treating you now.\n\nHad you not spent so much time and money already, I'd tell you to leave her to her own and just buy her a 200$ gift. Much better and less stressful.", "NTA\n\nYour sister should understand that what you are doing would have actually cost so much money had you not been her brother, and thus, this would probably be the most expensive wedding gift for her (figuratively and monetarily too).", "NTA. Get her a gift, and send her an invoice for your wedding planner services.", "NTA. Your help with the wedding was more than gift enough. That she got the family involved says even more about her character. I'm sorry you invested so much time in someone who lacks appreciation for all of your kindness!", "NTA and if it were me I wouldn't lift another finger. Let the photographer quit, stop assisting with anything, and when she comes crying about it tell her you have to take the work you've been missing out on to be able to afford her gift.", "NTA. Other family are helping during their free time, when they aren't earning their living. You have used working time and turned down paying clients in order to fit your sister into your client space. If you are doing that for free and she isn't paying you even a nominal amount, then yes, that is absolutely your gift for the wedding.\n\nAnd if she doesn't want that as a gift, then that's fine. She can settle up her bills for the services she has utilised, and you will get her a gift from her registry instead. Her choice. But you will not be buying her two gifts.", "NTA \n\nSend her an invoice for your services. Don't work for free.", "Nta but you really should\u2019ve specified it would be the gift when you accepted", "NTA, but next time specify it's your wedding gift.

Give her an invoice for your services, when she pays she can have a gift.", "It's so tacky and gross to *ask* for gifts in general...let alone maintain that someone's time and effort over months doesn't constitute a gift. Fine, send her an itemised bill - as in, how much doing what you did would have cost a paying customer. Then get her a $200 gift once she pays up.", "YWNBTA. But I would give her a choice. Present her with an accurate bill for your services. Say if she pays for your professional services, you'll happily buy her a gift off her registry.
