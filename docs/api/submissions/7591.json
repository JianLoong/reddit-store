She rehomed a deeply loved pet because she literally had no reasonable alternatives and it was the only loving thing to do for this creature that she cared so deeply about - to find it a good new home herself rather than surrender it to a shelter where she couldn't be sure if its long-term prospects.  And worst of all, she had to do so whilst grieving the deaths of two fellow Guardsmen, and possibly the serious illness/injury of another. I cannot imagine the stress she is under. \n\nAnd you looked at her under these circumstances and thought that the KIND and SUPPORTIVE thing to do or say was to suggest, not that she had done the best she could in impossible circumstances . . . but that her beloved canine family member was actually *better off without her, in someone else's home*?! \n\nJust . . . wow. Of course YTA. And you owe her a huge apology.", "YTA, in one statement you:\n\n* Implied your sister was worse at caring for her dog than the new people (yikes)\n* Invoked terminology suggesting the dog was dead (double yikes)\n   * Also, after several of her friends died or were super injured in deployment (triple yikes).\n* Reminded your sister about how you weren't there for her (you didn't have to be, but read the room).\n* Talked at all about something you should have stayed 1000 feet away from at all times.\n\nYou should have said nothing at all. You don't need to take her dog, though lord knows it would have been a kindness to her. But if you didn't, you certainly shouldn't be doubling down on it. It makes you seem like you are gloating about it. Yeesh.", "So let me get this straight. Your sister has to completely turn her life around in 3 weeks because 3 (presumably friends) are killed or injured in a car crash, she's rushed on a deployment, and her dog has to be rehomed. And all you can say is, \"Your dog is in a better place.\" YTA dude based on circumstance alone.", "YTA. She didn't need you to make a comment like that, she was just mentioning that she missed her pet. Are you always this tactless?", "YTA. Talk about kicking someone when they\u2019re down.", "YTA - I have a colleague that uses that term when I lose a pet. We know she means well but it really grates. Basically what you have just told her was that she was a crap pet owner and that her much loved companion is better off without her.\n\nComing from the person who decided for legitimate reasons not to look after her pet when she got called on a deployment at last moment, what do you think she might be thinking? That you refused because you thought she couldn't look after her pet (edited properly in the long run).", "You weren't obligated to house her dog, but YTA for rubbing her nose in it. Especially for implying that she was lacking as a pet owner.", "YTA. Why would you essentially tell her the new owners are better than her? That seems unnecessarily mean. You could have just not responded to dog related comments.", "YTA 100%. The dog is not in a better place, you just told your sister that she was a bad pet owner and it's a good thing she lost her pet. And yes, your sister will be upset at you about this for pretty much the rest of your lives, so figure out why and what went wrong. Do NOT pull a surprised Pikachu face when you need an emergency babysitter, your car broke down/got in an accident/etc. and you need to borrow one ASAP and can't wait on insurance, you are visiting and would like to stay at her place, or YOU get in an accident and need physical support. Because frankly she'll tell you that she has the time and could but doesn't want to.", "YTA. To your sister, the best place for her dog would have been with her family so she can reunite with her dog when she returns. She made a responsible choice to re-home it since you refused, but it\u2019s still obviously painful that she will never see her dog again. It\u2019s not in \u201ca better place\u201d from her perspective (or from anyone\u2019s perspective except for some reason yours\u2026).", "YTA\n\nYour sister just lost friends and had her whole life turned upside down, including having to rehome her dog. As you're in no way obligated to take in another dog for a full year, you need to learn to shut your mouth. She's allowed to miss her dog and talk about it, but what you said was cold and cruel.", "YTA FOR SURE!\n\nYou have every right to not take in the dog while your sister is deployed. \n\nHowever, YTA because that simply didn\u2019t need to be said. She is hurt enough having to give up her dog, and your comment rubbed salt into that open wound. Not cool at all.\n\nLastly, please consider practicing some tact and self-monitoring skills. There\u2019s tons of resources on the internet to help.", "YTA. You were under no obligation to take the dog if it wasn't going to work for you, but what you said was not helpful in the least and you should probably apologize to her and acknowledge that it was insensitive of you to say that.", "YTA. Your response to her was just a cherry on top of the shit sundae you\u2019ve already served her. You are immature and selfish. \n\nYour dad is right. Family helps family. Your sister probably didn\u2019t want to burden you any more than you wanted to be burdened. But those are the kinds of things family members do for each other. They go out of their way to assist a sibling in need.", "Yes, YTA. It's fine for you not to take her dog but you're not even acknowledging how hard it is for her. You make it sound like her dog is dead. Your sister might rehome you.", "YTA because the title made me think this dog was dead \nJokes aside, it is a bit patronising to say that when the dog was already in a good home, if it wasn't permanent then you should've helped her out really", "YTA Big time. You must have no empathy at all to tell her something like that. Knowing she doesn't have her dog to come back home to is hard. Animals are like family.", "YTA.  The person who was in a position to help someone else but chose not to should not be the one trying to reassure that someone else that the outcome was really for the best.  Especially when you make it sound like the dog died. That\u2019s just tone deaf. \n\nAnd to be clear\u2014Your reasons for not taking the dog were fine and do not make you the AH.  You trying to comfort your sister by saying what you said makes you the AH.", "YTA the best place would be the dog being with your sister, what kind of uncalled comment was that? \"Ask them to send pictures of the dog\" wouldve been appropriate, but not \"its in a better place now\" as if it died.", "YTA wtf. That's something people say when their pet finally passed away after a lot of suffering. You implied her pet was suffering with her and is happier elsewhere. You acted like it was dead. And you acted like all this was a GOOD thing.", "YTA", "YTA. You implied that she wasn\u2019t taking good care of her dog and that it\u2019s new family is more capable than she is. I worry about your dog now if you\u2019re that cold and uncaring.", "YTA - why did you think it was okay to tell her the dog was in a better home than hers? Why are you so flippant about her heart wrenching decision to give away her beloved pet? How do you know the dog is in a better home?", "YTA. While we may never know if the dog is truly in a better place I am certain that your sister did not wish to give it up. Dogs are like family and I could never see giving my pup up. Due to the nature of her work she was forced too and she is still clearly bitter about losing an animal she loved dearly. I don\u2019t think you meant it in a bad way but that is the definition of a tone deaf comment when it is directed towards a person that clearly loves and misses the animal.", "\u201cI had all the capacity to help my sister care for her beloved pet while she was deployed but couldn\u2019t be bothered to, then took a massive heartless verbal dump on her because she misses him.\u201d YTA", "I could give you so many reasons but I just say that yes, YTA", "YTA - you basically told your sister she was a bad dog owner.", "INFO: why were you the only family member who could have taken the dog?", "the nicest way I could put it is that you lack tact and failed to realize the consequences your actions have.\n\nEvery action you took was without regard for others- only what you think of correct- so I'm not sure why you're surprised that the people you're refusing to empathize with are hurt by your actions. It seems like common sense, but yeah you may need to get better at reading the room.", "YTA you could have just kept your mouth shut", "Yikes!  YTA for not keeping your mouth shut when it is completely obvious your comments are not welcome. I also think Y T A for not helping with the dog, but I guess you weren\u2019t obligated.  Your sister must be devastated, so congratulations on that.", "Yta . You added salt to the wound for no reason", "What? Yes YTA. You basically just told your sister she's a shit dog parent and some random family she rehomed him to is better than her. Also yeah, your right to not take in a dog if you don't want to, certainly. But if you absolutely could have and made it work with a bit of work on your end, and the other option was that your sister had to get rid of her own dog, yeah I'll call you an AH there too.", "YTA. \n\nDude someone's pet and friend had to go somewhere else due to a horrible situation and bad circumstances, you're 28 years old. Please grow up.\n\nEdit: Had to re-read but still grow up.", "YTA.  You could have watched the dog,  you had the time to watch the dog,  you just didn't \"feel\" like it.   I bet your sister loves that dog, and she will never get a chance to love with it again because of your selfishness.", "YTA.  The phrase \"they're in a better place\" is bad at funerals and even worse here.  You probably shouldn't say anything about the dog beyond \"I'm sorry \\[that you're sad and miss the dog\\]\".", "YTA - I can understand you wanting to assure your sister that the dog was in a **good** place, but using **better** is just digging at her for not being able to have a dog and deploy at the same time.", "YTA, both for not helping your sister and for rubbing her nose in it, and you know it.  What I don't know is why you would come here pretending not to realize it.", "YTA (and also selfish af.) Way to rub salt in an open wound.", ">I'm unsure what I did wrong\n\nSeriously? You basically called her a bad pet owner.\n\nYTA", "NAH. Taking care of a dog is not just letting him out for a few minutes and putting food in it\u2019s bowl. This isn\u2019t a few days. This is a year commitment. \n\nOP may have time rn but in a few months time their own life can change where they can\u2019t adequately care for multiple dogs. \n\nNot to mention the cost to care for the dog will be more than they budgeted for their own dog (vet bills/food) and we\u2019ll, dogs need the outmost attention and TLC, if someone is aware they can\u2019t expand themselves for whatever reason, I sure as Hell wouldn\u2019t push for them to watch over a breathing and living thing. \n\nYour sister is reasonable upset. But I\u2019m not sure why no one else stepped up to care for the dog or why she couldn\u2019t look for temporary placement. \n\nAnd if hers is a pup or juvenile, that means you gotta be on top of training and routine to make the dog comfortable in a new environment long term.\n\nAnd from what I\u2019ve heard from people around me, deployment can some times take longer than expected as well.", "Yes, YTA. If your not able to help due to allergies or a living situation that's one thing, but it sounds like you're just being selfish. \n\nMaybe you should get rid of your dog, but don't worry or be upset, they'll be in a better place with someone less selfish then you.", "YTA. What is so hard for taking in her dog while she\u2019s deployed? Lots of people have done this for soldiers before. Hope you never need a favor from her because you just burned a big bridge.", "YTA. You implied that the dog she loved was better off with a new family than her and used terminology that commonly means someone has passed away. What you said was heartless and cruel especially when your sister rehomed the dog due to her deployment not just because.", "YTA, You apparently don't understand the connection some people develop with their pets.", "Wow. YTA.", "YTA. She loved that dog and was forced to give it up. Don't rub her face in it.", "Just to be clear.  The problem isn't that you didn't take the dog and it isn't your fault your sister had to rehome the dog.\n\nYTA because you said \"the dog is in a better place\".  You do understand better means better than her, right?  So not only did you insult your sister, you completely dismissed the fact that the dog likely suffered, and is still suffering, from being rehomed.  Even if the new family is great, the dog doesn't understand why their person is suddenly gone and they are in a new place.  \n\nMaybe your intention was benign and you just chose the wrong words when you tried to comfort her but I struggle to understand why you don't understand how horrible your words were.  I think it is more likely that you don't like being asked and feel guilty for saying no so you (subconsciously or no) tried to wound her.", "Yta", "YTA \n\nIn my opinion your dad is correct family helps family especially when you have the means to do so, however I do understand your reasoning and it\u2019s not your job to house her dog especially for that extended amount of time. BUT you\u2019re a massive AH for making that comment. It was very rude and short sided of you and a borderline cruel thing to say to her. She lost a dog I\u2019m sure she was extremely fond of and you telling her that is in no way comforting.", "Yeah, YTA. Your sister had to re-home a pet that she loved. she didn't want to, but she was out of options. Of course she doesn't want to hear that her dog is \"in a better place\" because for her the best place for her dog is with her. You aren't obligated to take in another pet, but you should at least be sensitive to the fact that your sister is grieving the loss of a beloved friend and your words just rubbed salt in that wound.", "NTA, dont get a dog if you are deployable and don't have someone ready to care for it arranged far in advance.", "NTA. The dog IS in a better place than it would have been with OP. And if dad is so pissed & \u201cfamily helps family\u201d then why didn\u2019t he offer to take the dog?
