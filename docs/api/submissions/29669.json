I'll be calling the two women Brenda and Lisa. Lisa got engaged last year to her long term boyfriend (they dated in undergrad), and asked Brenda to be her maid of honor while she asked me to be her makeup artist and hair stylist. I said I'd be happy to.\n\nAs a little background on Lisa, she is a Christian (I am too) but she is the type of Christian who is SUPER judgmental of others for doing things she doesn't agree with (i.e. drinking, sex, etc.). She has bosted to everyone about how her and her fianc\u00e9 are waiting to have sex until marriage, and she makes sure EVERYONE is aware that they're virgins and saving themselves for each other.\nFast forward to the week before the wedding, Lisa and her Fianc\u00e9, Greg, throw a little wedding party where all the wedding party and plus ones were invited. One of the groomsmen brings his girlfriend, Jaime, to the party, which no one thought anything of. Later, after we\u2019re all drunk, Brenda, Jaime, and another bridesmaid went off to go do something. No one thought anything of it once they came back and the night continued on.\n\nThe next morning, Brenda calls me in a panic because supposedly she and the other bridesmaid were talking to Jaime in the kitchen the previous night at the party, and it was mentioned that Lisa and Greg were going to lose their virginity to each other.\n\nJaime looked confused and clarified that two years ago her and Greg (the groom who constantly told Lisa that he was excited to lose his virginity to her) had dated briefly and had sex during that time. After doing the math, Brenda and I realized that they had a fling during the six month break Lisa and Greg had been on. The other bridesmaid, who had been in the room with Brenda and Jaime, winded up telling all of the other bridesmaids later.\n\nFast forward to four days before the wedding, and all the bridesmaids are debating on whether to tell the bride or not about the news. I'm not exactly sure where they all were, but the groom approaches all of the bridesmaids, saying that he had heard that the bridesmaids knew about him lying to Lisa about his virginity this whole time (idk how he found out they knew). He looks at all of the bridesmaids and asks them not to tell Lisa about how he had lied this whole time about his sexual history. He claims that he plans on telling Lisa after the wedding and would appreciate it if no one tells her.\n\nBrenda tells me all of this, and I won't lie, I feel obligated to tell Lisa, as she is an old friend of mine and if I was in her position I would want to know. But we all know Lisa, and if she finds out about this she will most likely cancel the wedding. I've decided to mind my own business, leaving it up to the bridesmaids and maid of honor to tell Lisa, if they choose to do so.\n\nDoes this make me the asshole?", "created_utc": 1698279485, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gjkjh/aita_for_not_telling_the_bride_about_her_grooms/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think she holds the most responsibility in this matter as she was chosen to be somewhat of a leader of the group and the closest person to the bride.

She'll learn the same way that the groom learned about all the bridesmaids know. On the other hand, she'll be mad at everyone else (including you) so maybe tell her.\n\nPersonally, I stay away from rabid religious people.\n\nAnd I don't think this is judgment-worthy.

Obviously he's the biggest AH and frankly all of this manipulate is throwing up so many red flags from the groom.  How did he know he's pressuring all of you to keep something secret that's a really big deal to the women who has been saving herself.  That kind of manipulation screams cheater and/or abuser to me.  She needs to know so she knows who she's truly marrying, because I think in the long-run the most worrisome part of this isn't even going to be that he isn't a Virgin but that he's lied to her for a long time.\n\n\nEdit:  please update us that you told her I am so incredibly sorry and worried for this woman if not.", "I would tell the groom he has 24 hours to come clean or you are telling her.", "YTA.

If you care about Lisa, you should tell her the truth.  I would talk to the bridesmaids and ask if they will join you for the conversation with Lisa.

However, at least you will know in your heart that you did the right thing and were a good friend to her.  Wishing u the best!", "Absolutely tell her! I think saving your virginity for someone is utterly ridiculous but this woman has saved hers her entire life to \u201cgift\u201d it to someone who doesn\u2019t even respect her enough to be upfront and honest. No matter how insufferable she is, she does not deserve to feel the violation she is about to be faced with.

But if you are the one who is going to tell her, be prepared to be cast as the shit stirring trouble maker from the groom's camp.\n\nYou might even find that Lisa takes his side in believing him...\n\nI dunno - maybe an anonymous tip off?

And I'm sure Greg has factored in that once he and Lisa have slept together, she'll be even less likely to divorce him than the average person, because she'll see herself as \"damaged goods\" now that she isn't a virgin anymore.\n\nIf you ever considered this person a friend, you MUST tell her. But I agree with the above that there's safety in numbers, here.", "Yeah seriously, he's trying to trap her.\n\nHe's going to marry her, take her virginity, and she won't leave because of the religious pressure. Even if she does she'll have lost her virginity which she was really intentional about sharing only with her husband.\n\nI can't imagine that pain of betrayal. She'll feel sexually used.

In fact that the groom had told them not to and they listened knowing she was potentially about to permanently ruin her life? How do you recover from that heartbreak.", "Agreed!  Especially because saving herself for the right man seems to be SUPER important to her as well.
