Now it's been a month and he hasn't started a new job or done anything to get us money. Meanwhile I've borrowed money from my family to pay our rent and a few bills for the month. Also I have been cleaning houses and a few odds and ends jobs to earn money. I'm almost 8 months pregnant. He's done nothing to make sure we have a a flow of money coming in because \"we don't need anything right now\" I brought up that bills will keep coming. Well, the first job he was supposed to get never hired him he was relying on the 1000 sign on bonus that they had to pay for stuff. And now we're due another month of rent and bills with literally zero money to our names. He's supposed to finally start a job this coming week but I'm still so upset we're struggling because he won't step up and help us. His reasoning is that he doesn't want to do anything that isn't taxed by the gov. so that  he doesn't get audited. Am I the asshole for holding resentment against him for not helping us when we need it most?\n\nEditing to add that we still need so much stuff for our baby and I honestly don't know if we'll have everything we need by the time I am due. So it's making it so much harder for me to not stress that things aren't getting done. We have one more kid together he's a great dad so I don't understand where this is coming from.", "created_utc": 1682775282, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132t2vo/aita_holding_resentment_towards_partner_for/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
