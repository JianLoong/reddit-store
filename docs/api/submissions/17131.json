She has been a homemaker all her life. She's maintained the house, played a big part in raising my children, etc etc. I had declared bankruptcy about 9 years ago due to losing a lot of money in my business. My children took out loans and worked during their free-time to support themselves as much as they can and paid for their own education. Now both my children are independent, living by themselves and they have paid back their tuition loans and what not. I have been discharged from bankruptcy for about over a year at this point. I am still working at the job that I got after I declared bankruptcy, for 9 years now. The pay isn't good, but I like the job - it's very easy and the people are friendly. My wife has recently been visiting the doctor a lot recently. She's got quite a few medical problems. Migraine, chronic lung condition, fatty liver etc. Because of these medical problems, she can't be insured. My children have been giving her money to help with increasing medical expenses, and for any emergencies since she can't be insured. But recently, my children have reduced the amount of money they are giving her because they have financial commitments in their life (house, kids, etc), so my wife has been asking me for more money to make up for the difference. Thing is, I don't have any money to give her. My income is just enough to make ends meet. I do have some spare cash (few hundred dollars) after my expenses, but I want to use that money for my hobbies and things I want to purchase. I've asked my wife to get a job (she's got a bachelor's degree) to make up the difference but she says she can't work with her medical problems and lack of experience (not having worked her whole life). She keeps asking me to find a new job with a higher pay and keeps citing the fact that I am earning lesser than a fresh graduate with a bachelor's degree although I have nearly 25 years of experience, but I like my job so I don't want to switch.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1683985828, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gi4sa/aita_for_asking_my_homemaker_wife_to_go_to_work/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Scrubbing toilets?\n\nYour selfishness is disgusting and I can't help but expect that your wife is going to end up one of that large percentage of seriously ill women whose husband bails on her and leaves her destitute, homeless and abandoned.  After all, she's not earning her keep any more and not finding a way to support your hobbies, so she's got no value to you.", "YTA thats YOUR wife. Not a roommate or a friend, your wife. I wonder if the shoe was on the other foot how you would react to having LEGITIMATE health issues and your wife wanting you to work to pay for it.

You are a jerk sir. She worked with you for such a long time, took care of your house and kids and this is how you repay her? You have extra dollars, you choose not to spend it om her medical expenses. Your hobbies are not important at this point, her health is. She has valid reasons to not get a job, you don't. You like your job, that's good but you have to think about your wife as well.", "YTA\n\nYou too had an arrangement that she would take care of the home and kids and you would work. You have to honour that or have a conversation about your options. Telling her to go to work and minimizing her role is asshole behaviour.

You should support her until you retire as then you will get to relax at home soon, and she will still be caring for you and the home until death.", "YTA, at first I thought she was buying bags and dumb stuff. Turns out you're the one buying dumb shit, get your ass a new job and support that bloody woman who's worked her entire life taking care of you and your children.

You may need to try and find a job that pays better and offers health insurance. If you can't, see if you can get her on medicaid or even yourself. At least this way you are either guaranteed the medicaid or if you make too much as a couple then you may need to base your doctor appointments or treatments from the hospital and get charity care.", "I\u2019d like to hear op explain how he\u2019s not the ah.

She's your wife, not a stranger eating a sandwich on a bench in the park.", "YTA", "Where in the world do you live that one can\u2019t be insured because of pre existing conditions? That was part of the point of Obama care was one to make sure insurance providers can not deny people with pre existing conditions coverage. Another part was to make sure people didn\u2019t get denied access to treatments or continued treatments by insurances setting lifetime limits. The second one of which took effect right as my MIL was going through pancreatic cancer and saved her from her insurance being able to end her treatments coverage. \n\nYou can be denied life insurance for pre existing conditions is that maybe what you are thinking of? Does your job provide any type of insurance that would cover both you and your wife? If not dependent on your state and your income you could see if you guys are eligible for one of the Obamacare market plans or expanded Medicare for adults if your income is under X amount a year you might be eligible. \n\nI\u2019m going with YTA because I could never imagine doing this to my spouse if he became sick. We are supposed to take care of our spouses in sickness and you won\u2019t set aside a hobby for a bit? If you were to say you had gotten her healthcare but asked that once her health issues are recovered, if they do, that she help with work that would be understandable.", "YTA. Your wife has been working your entire marriage doing all sorts of labor that you don't have to worry about freeing up your time to dedicate to your career and providing, which you don't appear to have done very well tbh I'd say \"scraping by\" sounds appropriate. Now she is ill with no work experience - meaning she would likely need an entry level job despite that bachelors degree. She'd probably end up working fast food or retail - both jobs that are tough on your body. So you really think that is a more reasonable situation then you changing jobs to be paid fairly? You can't even try and angle for a raise at your current job? Or make some budgeting priorities and cut back on some of your hobby expenses for a while? \n\nIf common sense and respect for your wife isn't enough to get through to you, I assure you your life will change a lot if you no longer have your wife to cater to your every whim. You probably couldn't even accurately list all the things she does for you, and her going off to work instead of being your fill time homemaker will change your life a lot.\n\nIt seems as if you want a solution that doesn't change your life and circumstances one iota. That solution doesn't exist.", "Yta. The thing that many people don\u2019t understand about becoming a stay-at-home parent is that it literally nukes future career prospects. You can\u2019t be out of the workforce for years and expect to be able to jump back into a career. Your wife may have a bachelors degree but she\u2019s living in a world now where the bachelors degree is the new high school diploma and with no work history she can\u2019t compete. \n\nAdd her health issues on top of it and you\u2019ve got a recipe for disaster. When you guys decided that she would be a SAH parent you agreed that the benefits were worth the risk. Now you are seeing first hand why that arrangement isn\u2019t practical for most people because life happens. The odds are stacked against your wife here and you aren\u2019t taking any responsibility in acknowledging how you contributed to that. \n\nI can understand that money is severely tight right now but you can\u2019t wash your hands of a situation you helped contribute too. You don\u2019t get to have the best of both worlds. The two of you need to sit down and work out a plan. It is highly doubtful that your wife is going to be able to make enough money to cover her medical costs even if she does find work. She\u2019s going to be making minimum wage, regardless of her degree because her degree is old enough to have children of it\u2019s own. So even if she does get a job you WILL be contributing to her medical treatment or she will get sicker.\n\nThe two of you need to sit down and come up with a plan. You BOTH got yourselves into this mess and you both need to find a way out of this.

Jesus.", "ESH - You seem to expect her to get a job now, even though she's never really worked, is medically unfit, and therefore on both counts practically unemployable. I'm guessing you wanted her at home, meaning you encouraged this, so part of the blame for your current situation lies with you, even though you're trying to (albeit subtly) blame her.\n\nYour wife was stupid by making herself unemployable by choosing to not work at all, not even part-time; and she was selfish because she did it even when you went bankrupt and the kids were working and she wasn't caring for them anymore. I can't even imagine sitting back and not getting a job to help out at that point. Unless she was already ill by then, then that's not cool at all. And even if she was, she was still daft to not work at all, with the divorce rate and elderly women living poverty rates being so incredibly high, it's just lack of forethought.\n\nAnd your kids enabled both of you by giving you money in the first place (because you're married, and it's a shared pot, they weren't just giving it HER) instead of looking after themselves and putting their collective foot down with a no, you both need to step up and look after yourselves now.\n\nI don't think free choices for either of you are really on the cards here - you can't afford to keep you both on the wages you're on, but she's unlikely to be able to get and hold down a full-time job after all this time being unemployed.

Which all insurances cover.", "They\u2019ll make the copays and medications so expensive that you can\u2019t afford your health insurance, healthcare, or to keep yourself healthy. So sure, you\u2019re technically allowed to have it. In reality, not so much.", "Totally agree, and details in the post do make it sound like they're in the US.", "Well I live in the US and even if I have insurance from the US (my mom and dad has them here). Most times they won\u2019t cover it completely, will be denied, or won\u2019t take it. There are some conditions where you either have to pay out of pocket or go to a different country to do the procedure. Even my parents with US insurance have been told \u201cno\u201d by doctors to get prescription medication for their condition (they aren\u2019t that bad but there are some points that the pain hit hard).\n\nMe and my brother don\u2019t have insurance from here. That\u2019s why when i need to get my wisdom tooth pulled out and jaw surgery I have to go back to my country to do it.", "It sure as hell can when paired with other medical illnesses. OP didn't give the full medical illness list but if she has a fatty liver in addition to other things such as a problem with her lungs it can make doing a lot of manual jobs impossible. You also have to take her age into account. A job that is highly physical is less likely to hire a woman in her 50s who is also in and out of doctor offices or hospitals for illnesses. \n\nEven more so if this is the US", "(Not a defense of US healthcare system BTW)", "Every ACA compliant (i.e. what went into effect in 2014) policy requires that but there are many policies out there that aren't ACA compliant.", "I'm sorry, but that just isn't true. I have a high deductible plan that also doesn't cover pre existing conditions.", "Yes, but the OP is claiming his wife can\u2019t even get coverage because of vague medical conditions, including migraines (?). That\u2019s setting off fake post alarm bells, but I suppose it is possible. Also - why did it take 9 YEARS for him to ask her to get a job? He\u2019s been there since bankruptcy. I highly doubt, for as stretched as they are and he\u2019s only saved a couple hundred dollars in a decade, he wouldn\u2019t have brought this up before. Which is another red flag.\n\nWhich is why come clarifying comments would help. Regardless, if it is true YTA.", "Well yeah I see it but I\u2019m still kinda now divided on it. I do want to believe there is a reason why she can\u2019t get coverage but i also want to believe that op is either making it up some of the conditions (or isn\u2019t taking her to appointments) or these is a fake post.\n\nMaybe his kids stayed at home when they went to college or those conditions started to slowly develop. Ik the government gives a % of money depending on if the kid lives with you and their ages (i don\u2019t remember the specific name). Or op is trying to find a reason not to take care of his wife (or to cheat). \n\nYeah I doubt it too but who knows, maybe op is hella terrible with money and isn\u2019t willing to help because his time alone is more valuable than his wife health (or he might be cheating). I would only believe it if he took out loans and won\u2019t pay them. There are countless things that could have that ended up the business failing but who knows.\n\nYeah I know you meant YTA. \n\nI also read the only comment op made on a other subreddit and it makes me wonder.."]}
