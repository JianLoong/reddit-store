She should take care of her own lunch and not expect you to take care of it.

What.", "NTA\n\nI don't think that is a reasonable request when you have work to do. She went to bed early and can make her own lunch in the morning.", "NTA but you also don't want her to starve. Can you put the can of tuna and a fork in a lunch bag? Add a bun to go with it. Cold tuna sandwich is nutritious and delicious. And it'll give her the hint not to do this again.", "NTA. GF is way too entitled for my liking. If it was me, I'd say as innocently as possible, \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" Bottom line, unless you agreed when you moved in together that you would make **both** lunches every day, you're under no obligation to make her lunch for her. If you don't sit down with her *now* and talk about it, it will become a battle of wills, and possibly the end of your relationship.\n\nPerhaps you can come to a compromise. Set aside 10-15 minutes each night for both of you to make both of your lunches. If she wants to do full-on meal prep, that's all on her. Dropping not-so-subtle hints like she's doing is clearly a power play on her part, and it lets you know her time is more valuable than yours. Ignore the piles of food she's leaving out, and from now on, don't leave it hanging at \"maybe\" when she asks you to do something and you have commitments. Just say no!", "NTA. You never agreed to fix her lunch. She should have done it before going to bed", "NTA Your GF is a grown woman and can make her own damn lunch.", "NTA she can take a cab of tuna for her lunch since she didn\u2019t feel like cooking it, I guess.", "So when she asked, why didn't you just say \"no\"?  Instead, you got into a logic and reasoning argument with her, and left if at \"probably\".  I think it is perfectly fine to make someone's lunch on occasion, but it should not be expected.  She is old enough to schedule her own activities and time.  ESH.", "NTA\n\nBut you shouldn't be together. If my husband tells me he's too tired to do something and I'm feeling less tired, I'll do it. As he often does for me... we are here to help each other. if I'm going to do all of my life alone, without a partner who is there for me on the days I'm less willing, I might as well stay single!\n\nmoreover, you left an opening for her attitude saying that you would do it if you didn't forget.
