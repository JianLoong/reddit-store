Rachel recently turned 18, and she has a lot of chronic health issues she's been struggling with since she was little. We've been blessed that she has a lot of good periods, but right now she's having some trouble, likely due to the stress of next year's graduation and all that entails. I've been kept pretty busy making sure she stays as healthy as possible.\n\nI think Vik has always resented the extra attention his sister receives, which is understandable. I've always tried my best to make sure he has special time devoted to him, too, but I'd be lying if I said Rachel's health hasn't taken precedence over everything else. \n\nAbout a month ago we had the good news that Vik will likely be graduating early due to  academic excellence. I was so happy and congratulated him, but I noticed that since then his behavior seemed to be worse. He was more moody, short with me, not eating meals I made. \n\nLast week I took Rachel to the doctor's over a sinus issue. While we were there Vik called from school saying he was in a lot of pain and could I take him home early. I told him he knew I was at the doctor with Rachel. He got pissy and said some not-so-nice things about me favoring her. I'll admit I jumped to conclusions and thought that this, combined with his other bad behavior, meant he was just trying to get attention, since his early graduation news hadn't given him enough. I told him because of his attitude I wasn't picking him up early at all, and after Rachel's doctor visit was over I went to work as usual.\n\nWhen I got home, everything seemed normal. But when I called the kids down for dinner Vik didn't come. When I checked his room I quickly realize he's genuinely sick. I immediately rushed him to the doctor's and apologized profusely to him for not believing him initially. \n\nI tried to explain that his behavior recently is why I assumed he just wanted attention. He said if it was Rachel I wouldn't have made that assumption, though I assured him this wasn't true. Since then he hasn't really talked to me. Was I really being the asshole? I think I made an honest mistake and corrected it as soon as I found out things were serious.", "created_utc": 1688220972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nw7s8/aita_for_initially_not_believing_my_son_when_he/", "score": 9243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You haven't just prioritized Rachel's health, you have prioritized her very being to the detriment of your son and you know it.  You even realize that he is justifiably resentful then go ahead and reinforce the source of the problem.\nIn fact, you seem to resent the fact that he deserves not just \"some\" attention but *extra* attention sometimes.   \n\n>combined with his other bad behavior, meant he was just trying to get attention,\n\nWhat other bad behavior?  Do you mean acting like a teen who wishes that just *once* his mother could put some effort into his acknowledging his existence?   Even if he had been looking for a bit of attention, punishing him by ignoring his plea for help was unconscionable.   You got angry when he called you out and and left him sick at school.  What lesson were you trying to teach there?   Because what I read was you telling him to shut up because you were already involved with Rachel.\n\n>He said if it was Rachel I wouldn't have made that assumption, though I assured him this wasn't true.\n\nThat was a lie and he knows it.  You did not make an \"honest\" mistake, you acted as you always do and downplayed what he was saying..   You think he's upset because he didn't get enough attention for graduating early?   Why would he feel that way?  What have you done to celebrate?   Are you having a party or even a cake?   What did you do beyond \"That's nice\", I have to take Rachel to an appointment?   From your post, it seems that you don't really want to give it too much attention because Rachel isn't doing as well as he in school.\n\nWhat are Vik's plans for post-graduation?   Do you even know?  Maybe he's wondering how he can possibly pursue his aspirations knowing that you will tell him you ~~can afford~~ won't be able to help him because you have to do so much for Rachel.   \n\nThis one incident is probably a just a slice of your son's everyday life.   You are far too used to making excuses.", "YTA absolutely. You've poisoned the relationship between your children and neglected your son. If he cuts contact with you the minute he's out of the house it will be deserved.", "YTA. \n\n*He said if it was Rachel I wouldn't have made that assumption, though I assured him this wasn't true.*\n\nBut he is right, you would never make an assumption that Rachel was making it up for attention. Imagine if the illness was serious and he was dead because of your assumption. Your neglect also is putting a wedge between Rachel and him. Also, there's been many similar stories on this with Reddit, so here's your future if this keeps up: He will move out and cut contact, he will get married and you won't be invited, and he will have kids whose lives you you will not be a part of. So do you like that?", "YTA. That was just mean. If you truly cared about your son you would\u2019ve taken him to the doctor anyway no matter what he said. What if he had a ruptured appendicitis? He could\u2019ve died you didn\u2019t know that And you didn\u2019t even care.\n\nTaking him after the fact Was just another snub you proved his point the daughter was more important just for an office visit. If you truly cared about him you would\u2019ve found out what was going on. I understand where he\u2019s coming from. Sounds like this has been his life. Oh daughters health is more important than sons. I get it he is being left out especially with a medical problem because daughters problems are more important", ">I tried to explain that his behavior recently is why I assumed he just wanted attention. He said if it was Rachel I wouldn't have made that assumption, though I assured him this wasn't true.\n\nYou're a liar. If it was your daughter you would've rush to the doctor because she have health issues. You clearly favor your daughter and you taught your son that he can't rely on you because he'll always be second, if he's polite enough and if you're in a good mood.\n\nI'll jump to conclusions too but honestly I won't be surprised if he's going NC as soon as he can. You're not a shitty parent but you admitted yourself that \"I'd be lying if I said Rachel's health hasn't taken precedence over everything else.\" He's probably feeling left out and forgotten because his sister's health is more important than him - and more important than his health since he called you because he felt sick and was in a lot of pain and you did... Absolutely nothing. As I said, don't be surprised if he decide to go NC with you when he'll leave.\n\nEdit: YTA of course.", "Of course YTA. You didn\u2019t even try to pretend to care about Vik.  I feel sorry for him. You clearly favor Rachel", "YTA..well? Was he wrong about you favoring her? About you assuming he was faking an illness until he got worse but wouldn't assume if it was Rachel? You really don't get it do you? You're 1 step away from having an estranged son cut you off from his life. Think about it.", "Obviously YTA. Your son had an illness bad enough that it warranted him calling you to pick him up when he likely knew that you were busy with Rachel and would be upset with him for asking. Rather than do that, you berated him for asking for support from his mother. More than that, you accused him of making up an illness so that you would give him attention as if that helps your case. If your child is desperate enough to FAKE AN ILLNESS to get your attention, you have not been a good parent to them. And he wasn\u2019t even faking it, he was, in your words, \u201cgenuinely sick.\u201d Again, a good parent would not have doubted that their child was lying about an illness. \n\nI don't know where you are located but I'm assuming the US, so here are the facts: \n1. Rachel is legally an adult who can take care of her own medical needs, you weren't needed at the appointment.\n2. Your son called you, presumably in the afternoon, and you didn't check up on him until DINNER. \n3. You are so in denial about your blatant favoritism of Rachel that you were willing to put your son\u2019s health at risk because you were angry that he called you out on it. \n\nYou will be infinitely lucky if Vik decides to keep in contact with you when he graduates, but based on the way you've handled this whole situation I think you should prepare for the fact that you might never see him again once he graduates. \n\nYou are a huge, HUGE asshole.", "YTA, even if he was lying, it was a scream for attention. The fact he said he was in a lot of pain and you didn't even care, poor kid. I think what you did is beyond repair, you definitely wouldn't have made that assumption if it was Rachel.", "YTA. He's not going to forget this.", "YTA and I bet this kid goes no contact as soon as he can. Even the school could see he was in pain and you didn't consider him because you were so worried he was going to take attention away from Rachel.", "YTA. You clearly favored Rachel over Vik. You just taught Vik not to trust you anymore if you wanted to help him. There are some mistakes that are too late to make corrections on.", "Yeah YTA. Unless your kid has a history of faking sick there us no reason at all to ignore them when they say they are. He's right if it had been Rachel you wouldn't have questioned it. Also in case you've forgotten all teens get moody. So essentially you ignored your son being sick because he's been acting like every other teen I've ever known.", "YTA\u2026 My mother prettt much did this to me. Neglected getting me glasses because she thought I was lying to have them like my sister, I became chronically ill at 14 and she thought I wanted attention. I ended up having peptic ulcer disease, IBS, severe acid reflux\u2026POTS diagnosed at 19\u2026 and now a possible autoimmune disease\u2026you\u2019ve shown him he can\u2019t rely on you or trust you\u2026", "YTA \nThank God, you are not my mother. Even if I lied about being sick, my mom would still check on me the minute I said it. Why? Because she loves me, cares about me, worries about me. And you don't even have proof that your son was lying but still proceeded to ignore him. God, I have never seen a parent as cruel as you. What if , I mean what if he had died because of your neglect of his well being? Would you apologizing to him  bring him back? \nThere are so many people in this world who want children and would absolutely love them and treat them like treasure and here you are treating your son as trash. If you can't handle 2 kids then you shouldn't have given birth to another one. If there was a chance to change I really wish that he would not be born to a mother like you. You might be a good mom to your daughter but to your son - he would be better off without a so called \"mother\" like you.", "Assuming your child wasn\u2019t actually sick, and was \u201cjust\u201d seeking attention. \n\nGive your kid some freaking attention. Have a discussion with him about good/bad ways of looking for attention, but give it to him. Don\u2019t just reward the bad behavior, but figure out what is actually going on. \n\nWe all want to be acknowledge and recognized by the people we love. A 16 yr old kid misbehaving for attention is in desperate need. \n\nI have kids your kids\u2019 ages. I have found talking to them about things has been far more effective than punishments. Yes, there are sometimes consequences for actions, but usually, a conversation or two is enough. Finding out the WHY of behaviors, the root cause of them, will accomplish far more. Behaviors are a symptom and reacting to them is just putting a bandaid on them.", "YTA \n\nYou said flat out he is pushed to the side often by you. Even if he was just acting out for attention, maybe give it to him.", "YTA", "YTA. Being dismissed and not believed when you are ill has long term impacts, especially in the case where his needs have been deprioritized for years. Go to family therapy if you want to salvage it. And BE WILLING TO LISTEN TO HIS FEELINGS. Punishing him for his justified resentment and sadness is immature and selfish. If you want to repair things with him, you have to be willing to listen", "Hes not wrong because if it had been your daughter you wouldnt have questioned it, you would have taken her word for it and collected her.\n\nAt no point did you say, my sons behaviour includes pretending to be sick to gain attention so when he said he was sick why would you not believe him?\n\nYour response should have been, im sorry i cant pick you up straight away as im in the doctors but as soon as im finished i will come get you.\n\nTheres no making up to your kid the fact you called them a lier and really didnt give a fuck. \n\nActions speak louder than words and your action spoke volume.\n\nThis is on you so i really dnt know why your trying to put the blame on your son. If he hadnt have behaved like that, i wouldnt have behaved like this.", "YTA\n\nAs a fellow \"throw away child\" I can absolutely relate to what he must be feeling. \n\nOf course he acted out to get attention because he knew that was the only attention he was going to get, but for you to say you assumed he was lying about being sick simply because he's been \"moody\" and that you wouldn't pick him up \"because of his attitude\" all you did was prove to him ONCE AGAIN that he's not as important as his sister.\n\nYou claim it was \"an honest mistake\" but most everyone here can see this is a bold faced lie, do you think your son can't?

It had progressed untreated to the point half his intestines had to be removed and he almost had to get a stoma bag.

Never followed up with a cardiologist or even a regular doctor...she was was just annoyed I got sent home from school. However if the nurse called because my sister had a sniffle mom would drop everything to drive like a mad woman to pick her up.

I then talked with them about WHY they were so done with school, to see if I could help with a resolution.  \n\nThey tested me a few times, and when they realized I was serious - I actually allowed it - they didn't bother to take the free days. In fact, I tended to hear more about their school issues, voluntarily.  And if they said \"I'm sick\" I knew they actually WERE sick.  It worked like a charm.\n\nNext ... OP... The correct way of dealing would be to fetch him from school, and THEN evaluate if he was actually sick.  \n\nBoth of my kids had different needs at different times. And when they were in conflict, I made the choice to jump to the immediate needs of both, then triage my time. As a result, both of my kids trusted me to BE THERE when they needed me.  I made a point of it.  And yes, there were times of conflicting needs.  I juggled so they both knew I would do my best for BOTH of them.  \n\nWas it harder on me?  Yeah. But, in the end, I have two grown adults, with whom I share great relationships.  They both stand on their own two feet, but in the moments when they could use a hand, or they need me to have their backs, they know they can rely upon me. Have they abused me?  Absolutely NOT.  In return, I have two adults who would not be happier to be a help to me, if I need it, and I don't abuse them.\n\nWe have a family TEAM.  \n\nOP ... It's not too late. Build your team. It's honestly worth every single moment of work that you put into it.", "I guess I'm going against the grain here. I vote NTA, but you're not completely absolved of any wrongdoing. You made a mistake and apologized when you realized it, which is awesome. Even if Vik was attention-seeking, understanding where he's coming from and buying into it wouldn't have hurt you just this once. As a parent, I totally understand where you're coming from with your actions, but I think you just lost sight of the very obvious fact that he's feeling less than. I think labeling you an AH is harsh, honestly. We make what we think is the best decision as parents and pray that we're right, but we're human and will absolutely make the wrong choice from time to time. Give yourself some grace and just learn from the experience.", "posts like these make me appreciate my mother infinitely more.

Again YTA", "YTA. So when you discovered your son was genuinely sick and you'd been wrong about him lying, you told him it was his fault because he's been so awful recently? Blaming someone for you mistake is not how you apologise so I suggest you try properly apologising and look to why you were so ready to dismiss his needs.\n\nI'm baffled why you thought he was lying in the first place? Unless he's rang from school saying he needs to come as he's unwell before and then you felt he wasnt truthful, it seems like a stretch to assume he was lying just because you were at your daughter's medical appointment. It seems like you were frustrated by the inconvenience and took it out on him instead of dealing with it.", "YTA", "YTA. I understand having one kid that has different needs, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the other kid is always doing something for attention. First off, if he is saying he\u2019s sick at school whether he is sick or not you should go get him. Being \u201csick\u201d at school could be an excuse to get away from bullying or other dangerous situations that could be going on if he\u2019s not actually sick. He is 100% right that without even a millisecond hesitation you would\u2019ve dropped whatever you were doing to get Rachel and he understands why, but it\u2019s difficult to feel like your parents don\u2019t favor one child over the other when the other has constantly been playing second fiddle his whole life. Whatever head behavior he has been exhibiting could definitely e linked to not feeling loved or appreciated or even congratulated for graduating (middle? high?) school early. It\u2019s totally understandable and no matter what you say to him now, it\u2019s gonna take a very long time before he feels loved and like you\u2019re not favoriting her. And don\u2019t try to love bomb him now because you will never be able to keep it up and as soon as that falls off the table he will be feeling even worse than he is now and/or he will see right through this as a manipulation tactic", "Had Rachel been sick you would not have made the same assumption and you know it. \n\nDealing with a sick child is hard and demanding and you are a single parent.

They end up using drugs or alcohol, gambling, or who knows what else to fill the void. You need to not only tell your son, but also to provide more parenting to him. Which means being available when he actually needs you. He won't know when he needs you in advance. And he won't always ask. So, you need to be in his life every day, establishing and reaffirming your unconditional love. Asking him how his day went, how his friends are, etc... and you need to show that you are capable of loving more than one child at a time. Have conversations with both kids at the same time if you can about anything. Ask them what they think the other will be like as an adult.

Mostly bout unimportant crap sometimes they will lie about being sick so they can be home playing this newest COD. One day you\u2019ll think they are lying when they actually tell the truth. This doesn\u2019t not make u a bad parent or a unredeemable person. Relax.", "I see this too. I'm betting that this was the final thing for him. In another event where he needed his mom for real,  she let him down again. How many things did he miss because mom was at the doctor, or Rachel wasn't feeling well? How many times did he ask for something minor only to be told no,  or not right now,  or after I take care of this for Rachel. \n\nETA: and I think it's not medical emergency reasons she misses. She chose when to schedule these appointments and couldn't be bothered to consider his schedule.  \n\nHe's absolutely going as far away as he can,  and it wouldn't surprise me to find out he intentionally moved up his graduation to get out of there sooner.

This is not a cold or flu.\n\nThey typically develop over time.

Because he knew what responses he would and would not get.\n\nStop and think about that for a moment. Your son may have been choosing to live with that stomach pain for months because he did not believe telling you would do any good.\n\nAnd even if this was an acute onset case, it doesn't make it any better. The pain is still real, and would have felt worse because it was a sudden spike up the pain scale, not a slowly building burn.\n\nAnd when he did call what was your response? Not even an \"I'll be there as soon as I can\" or \"I'll see if I can find someone to come get you\".

It feels like you would make everything about you even with the therapist and not bother actually listening to him without getting worked up and offended about him rightly calling you out.  \n\n\nReally why should he even bother trying to talk to you at all?", "Strained for a while? LMFAO. Your relationship with your son is DONE the moment he leaves your home.", "\u201cNot taking the situation lightly\u201d means the very first thing you do here is acknowledge the discrepancy in your behavior\u2014until that happens, none of your attempts to mend things will actually begin to heal the wound. That\u2019s going to be hard because it requires you to acknowledge a way in which you\u2019ve been a bad mom, and that\u2019s a heavy thing to accept. But if you actually get to a place of understanding, you can work to truly rebuild your connection with your son, and he will have an example of what a good parent does when they realize a way they\u2019ve been fucking up.\n\nSeeing you own this and acknowledge that your attention has been focused on Rachel and validate the hurt that\u2019s caused him is the best thing you can do for both him and Rachel because, more than anything, kids need to know how to confront failure. You failed in one of your duties as a mom. Your kids are going to do the same in their lives; everybody fucks up, and sometimes the fuckups are *big*. The greatest gift you can give your children as they move into adulthood is an example of how to honestly, genuinely, openly accept being wrong about something.\n\nThat\u2019s why your suggested attempts for reparations have been met with disapproval here. The problem goes deeper than that, and your attempts to fix it have to go deeper than that too. Do *not* involve his early graduation in any of this. Any recognition of his success needs to be *about his success*. And your efforts to fix things with him need to actually be about the problem itself and the way it\u2019s affected your family.\n\nIt\u2019s *understandable* that your attention has been displaced to favor Rachel. It\u2019s fucking scary to have to worry about your kid day in and day out over years and years and years. Nobody handles that gracefully, so it\u2019s understandable that this is where you\u2019ve ended up. Understandable, but not *justifiable*. So you don\u2019t have to justify it, you just have to understand it. You\u2019re only a tiny portion into the life you get to have with your children. If you change course now, it can be a good life that makes everyone involved genuinely happy, but you can\u2019t fall into the sunk cost fallacy and think that now that you\u2019ve planted your flag somewhere you have to defend your choice. Things can change. *You* can change.\n\nAnd I\u2019m really not exaggerating when I say that seeing how a parent models what to do when they need to make a fundamental change is the greatest gift you can give your children. There will be times in their life they realize they\u2019ve fucked up and hurt people they love. They need to know what to do when that happens, and this is your opportunity to show them what it means. It\u2019s going to hurt to acknowledge the hurt you\u2019ve done, but it\u2019s going to hurt a hell of a lot more if your son keeps feeling like this and continues living without faith that his mom will take care of him.\n\nThat hurts your daughter, too, by the way, who needs her brother on her side, not burdened by his own hurt over their shared but separate childhoods. And one day you\u2019re going to die and they\u2019ll only have each other, so you have a responsibility to create an environment that meets both of their needs and brings them together instead of tearing them apart.\n\nI don\u2019t think you understand how massively you\u2019ve fucked up. Which is also understandable, since acknowledging the truth of it is going to hurt *bad*. You need a therapist to go through that process with you or it\u2019s going to be too much to handle. But you can do it. I\u2019ve seen it done in my own family\u2014and I\u2019ve seen it not done. Give yourself time to sit with yourself and really process the situation. It\u2019s possible to make up for this, but it\u2019s going to take the rest of your life, so if you don\u2019t do it now, you\u2019re going to run out of time to save your relationship with your son.", "You know what gets me here?

When my other siblings and I got home from school, they said she didn't have broken ribs from falling the night before, but the Dr thought she might have fallen because of her ear infection. I said I'm the one who fell and tried to show my mom my back. She said you need to stop lying it, wasn't you. I was sent to our room and was grounded for a month for lying. I was 10 at the time.

I said yeah I was in a car accident 6 months ago. He says well that only explains the new ones, not the ones that are about a decade old. Do you remember anything from when you were a kid. I told him the story of falling down the stairs he said yeah that will do it.

You assume things of him, without reason, most likely because you're deflecting your guilt. (\"I'm not neglecting my son, he's just making up stories for attention\").\n\n2.

Go to family therapy or not, your son will likely drift away and not come back. Honestly, I wouldn't either.\n\nEDIT AFTER READING OPS COMMENTS;\nHe had a stomach ulcer?!

Practically, this means that about 90% of my health issues were TREATED as me \"attention seeking\" despite being, you know, actual medical problems (and honestly not wanting attention, it was ALWAYS negative, no matter the reason that led to attention, it turned into a punishment. Anyway, moving on) so ironically I was both your children at the and time\n\nYour son was AT SCHOOL. Trust me, they know what to look for, and the fact that they LET him call you was clue number 1 that it was REAL. \n\nBut also, look, BACK THE FUCK UP. \n\nEven if he was the healthiest child on the planet, and IF it had been fake, you know what you SHOULD have seen? \n*THAT YOUR SON FUCKING NEEDS YOU*\n\nAnd maybe consider your daughter, too - if she's anything like me, she feels AWFUL every time one of her brothers needs our accomplishments is overshadowed by her health. In medical jargon, you are ignoring the acute in favor of the chronic, and that's ALWAYS backwards.\nIf she's NOT feeling guilty, that's ALSO a problem - you've raised BOTH your kids to know she's going to be prioritized *no matter what*, so you've got an entitled daughter and a neglected and abused son (and don't mistake me - neglect IS abuse. Having suffered both physical abuse and neglect, I'll take the being beaten, thanks) (And YES, people with health issues can be entitled. More than one thing can be true) point is, you're either making both your children feel awful, or you're contributing to your daughter growing into an entitled ass who expects (with reason) mommy to drop everything every time for her, and to prioritize her wants over her brother's NEEDS. Which has possibly destroyed your son. \n\nHere's what you do. Set up family counseling IMMEDIATELY. Set up *personal* counseling EVEN FASTER. Pull your head out, understand you've fucked up - not this specific instance, but for your son's entire LIFE. You cannot \"make up\" for it - all you can do is*CHANGE*. You're going to have to WORK to even have a CHANCE to show him that you DO want to change. \n\nYour other option is to admit you don't care about your son and find him someone else to finish raising him who would do more than you to parent him. Since JEFFREY DAHMER would actually pay attention to the kid...\n\nYes, I'm being harsh. No, except for the line about Dahmer I'm not overreacting/ exaggerating. I don't know why you've been abusing your son (it's never JUST about the health of the other child) but it *IS* about YOU, and you need to fix it (fix YOUR PROBLEM) whether that's by putting in the work or by admitting to the world you're a shit parent and getting him to a SAFE place where he is TREATED WELL\n\n(This is how future psychopathic misogynistic incel evil assholes are created at least some of the time.

Then made him suffer while you went to work which by the way your post is written you would never done to your daughter.\n\n 1. That shows him that you don't care about him and that she's more important even when he's also not well. \n\n  \n2. You shattered the trust that he had in you. Trust is earned. And you now need to re-earn his trust. \n\nI don't see you giving him special devoted time. To you that may be a car ride to somewhere one on one. The fact that he's likely graduating early due to academic excellence and you \"congratulated him.\" But excuse her now worse illness because of \"next year's\" graduation and \"all that entails\" is a prime example of your putting one above the other. I'd be over the moon for my child and throw a party, take them out, something great to celebrate. Not just a congratulations. You can equally care for your children even when one has chronic illnesses - and I'm speaking as something living with chronic illnesses. \n\nHave you ever asked yourself or him why he feels the way he does and/or acts this way? Tried to actually sit down and communicate with him? Based on all of this I doubt it. Because you're more interested in your daughter and making excuses for your actions. His behavior is justified. And if I were you, I'd figure out how to treat them equally and make him feel seen AND heard before it's too late. If he cuts ties at some point, you'll have yourself to blame and don't ask yourself why he doesn't talk to you. Shit like this is why. And this is just one instance of one day.

It's being a parent. He shouldn't have to be so ill that he doesn't come down for dinner for you to realize he's actually sick. I am sure you felt like he was being dramatic when you went to check on him. It should NOT have taken a failed appearance at DINNER for you to believe that your child was actually sick.

The child with special needs of course needs a lot of time and attention, but the other children have perfectly normal needs for love, affection, and feeling important to their parents.

Do you have any idea how lucky you are? Your other kid needed you for once, but you were too busy, once again, with Rachel. You will always be too busy. \n\nI know someone who had a special needs child. Her other kids told me their Mom never had any time for them, and whatever they needed, it was always nothing compared to their sister\u2019s needs. When the sister eventually died, the other kids were adults. After the worst of her grief had passed, the mother all of a sudden started calling, texting, and trying to spend a lot of time with her other kids and grandkids. None of them were interested. They had all built walls and were indifferent to her. If someone had to die for their mother to be interested in them, then they weren\u2019t interested in her. It\u2019s been years, and the kids reluctantly see her every now and then, but there\u2019s not really any relationship. \n\nSo ask yourself this. Does your son believe that his sister would have to die for him to have any importance to you at all, and even that is questionable? Does he think he has to be actually dying for his mother to care?

I would tell her I didn't feel well and she would get upset. I could only stay home from school if I was running a fever and throwing up (if it was just a fever and only a minor fever I probably had to go to school anyways because I was the kid who would get sick and then stay sick for like 2 weeks at a time) and then I couldn't miss more than a week of school at a time because otherwise she would have to have a doctor's note to let me come back to school and she didn't want to pay for a doctor's note. \n\nMost memorably, I was a junior in high school, and I got very sick.

I made it through breakfast and 5 minutes into first period before I physically could no longer continue on (and I could barely speak because speaking felt like someone slashing a hot knife down my throat) and my Spanish teacher made me go to the nurse who immediately called my mom to get me. \n\nMy mom yelled at me the whole ride to the urgent care clinic (this was the first time I'd seen a doctor since she and my dad split up, so I likely hadn't been to a medical professional for about 5 years at this point despite the fact I routinely got this sick at school at least once a year every year, though this time was admittedly the worst) because I knew that she couldn't afford this shit... I didn't really have the energy to even fight with her about it honestly. \n\nWe get in there and I get evaluated and the urgent care doctor tells me and my mom that \"in my 20 years of working urgent care I've seen a lot of strep throat before but this is likely the worst case of strep I've ever seen...\" he actually wanted to hospitalize me for it, but my mom was adamant that we didn't do that unless it was absolutely necessary. So he sent me home with the strongest antibiotics he could and a return to school in three days note and said if I was still feverish on day three to go to the er. Thankfully the meds worked though and I started recovering pretty quickly... \n\nBut my mom was somehow still mad at me for having gotten sick. And my \"really really sick\" days were the only ones I was ever allowed to stay home for - otherwise I had to go to school thank you very much. I never got personal days, no matter what, because that simply wasn't a thing for me, even when I wasn't feeling great. \n\nSomehow, my little sister did, though. And sure, she wasn't as sick as me - but any time she went to my mom and told her she wasn't feeling well she wad allowed to stay home, and any time my sister needed a \"sick\" day she could have it (and to be fair my sister only asked for those like once or twice a year but still) whereas if I went to my mom about how stressed I was I got told that I could handle it, lol. \n\nDon't get me wrong - I adore my mom and our relationship hasn't been irreparably damaged... but also, there was a reason I moved 4 hours away (which is an eternity for an old lady who has mad driving anxiety like her lol) as soon as I could and never really considered moving back.

Occasionally my parents will remember that have an older child, not just some live-in babysitter or whatever they want to call it, and I'll get something (I ask for money for gifts now because no one ever gave me what I actually asked for. And it was never too expensive because we're not well off, but nooo getting me something stupid like a Invader Zim backpack from Hot Topic was too hard, so here's a shirt in the wrong size!).

They spend so much time and attention with the sick one and the other child suffers. Sick child has a beautifully decorated room, other child didn\u2019t even have a hamper until I bought one. It pisses me off", "This was also my Mom. \n\nSuper awesome feeling like you\u2019d be put through hell if the doctor didn\u2019t find anything.", "My mother told me I was, \"not her son\" on my 22nd birthday when I refused to give her money (after loaning her money she hadn't paid back a few months prior, when I had my own apartment and was about to be homeless due to the money I had already given her and was working minimum wage at McDonalds to survive).\n\nI am just shy of 38. I will remember that birthday for the rest of my life.", ">even that she had to go to the doctor's because of sinus issues. She's chronically ill, it's normal for chronically ill people to have regular docor' visits, why give that detail??\n\nAlso note that she mentions why Rachel was in the doctor's office but didn't even bother to mention what was wrong with Vik that was \"genuinely serious\" despite it being the primary subject of the whole damn post.", "Sounds like she prob did that on purpose bc the statistical likelihood of an otherwise healthy teen boy developing an ulcer so bad he makes a phone call about it, is so, so low. I grew up under extreme trauma and developed a bleeding stomach ulcer at 12. The gastroenterologist looked my mom in the eye in front of me and said \u201cidk what\u2019s going on at home but this needs to be better by the next time I see her.\u201d HEAVILY insinuating this was due to my environment. She confessed later to me that he scared her a lot. So, yes, OP YTA, and you\u2019re probably even worse than TA.", "Heyyo . Years ago, my father h.ad appendicitis but his father told him to quit faking and get up and mow the lawn.  A few years ago I had appendicitis and my father told me to get my act together and quit cancelling meetings. \n\nFortunately I have no kids", "I was a chronically ill kid. If she's really been as ill as indicated she should be more than well versed in talking to doctors. I was filling my own forms around 8/9 and spending days/weeks in the hospital without a parent or family member present by 12. Mom was a single parent, and the children's hospital was nearly four hours away from home, so she could only come up on the weekends or she couldn't afford my care. And you know, my brother who needed care too. So. Yea.", "Ah, may I introduce you to TGin-the-goldly? She too succeeded *despite* her parenting. \n\nIn the end, what truly matters is that we can look on our own achievements with pride. Don\u2019t deny yourself that. It takes strength of character to achieve what you have whilst being ignored and punished for *not* being a little shit."]}
