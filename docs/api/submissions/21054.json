Rachel recently turned 18, and she has a lot of chronic health issues she's been struggling with since she was little. We've been blessed that she has a lot of good periods, but right now she's having some trouble, likely due to the stress of next year's graduation and all that entails. I've been kept pretty busy making sure she stays as healthy as possible.\n\nI think Vik has always resented the extra attention his sister receives, which is understandable. I've always tried my best to make sure he has special time devoted to him, too, but I'd be lying if I said Rachel's health hasn't taken precedence over everything else. \n\nAbout a month ago we had the good news that Vik will likely be graduating early due to  academic excellence. I was so happy and congratulated him, but I noticed that since then his behavior seemed to be worse. He was more moody, short with me, not eating meals I made. \n\nLast week I took Rachel to the doctor's over a sinus issue. While we were there Vik called from school saying he was in a lot of pain and could I take him home early. I told him he knew I was at the doctor with Rachel. He got pissy and said some not-so-nice things about me favoring her. I'll admit I jumped to conclusions and thought that this, combined with his other bad behavior, meant he was just trying to get attention, since his early graduation news hadn't given him enough. I told him because of his attitude I wasn't picking him up early at all, and after Rachel's doctor visit was over I went to work as usual.\n\nWhen I got home, everything seemed normal. But when I called the kids down for dinner Vik didn't come. When I checked his room I quickly realize he's genuinely sick. I immediately rushed him to the doctor's and apologized profusely to him for not believing him initially. \n\nI tried to explain that his behavior recently is why I assumed he just wanted attention. He said if it was Rachel I wouldn't have made that assumption, though I assured him this wasn't true. Since then he hasn't really talked to me. Was I really being the asshole? I think I made an honest mistake and corrected it as soon as I found out things were serious.", "created_utc": 1688220972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nw7s8/aita_for_initially_not_believing_my_son_when_he/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are some mistakes that can\u2019t be corrected.", "YTA. I am the sibling of someone who was chronically sick with asthma growing up. The difference in how they were treated by my mom vs me was palpable. Resentment grew. I grew up, went to grad school hours away, and didn\u2019t talk to my mom for over a year.

You haven't just prioritized Rachel's health, you have prioritized her very being to the detriment of your son and you know it.  You even realize that he is justifiably resentful then go ahead and reinforce the source of the problem.\nIn fact, you seem to resent the fact that he deserves not just \"some\" attention but *extra* attention sometimes.   \n\n>combined with his other bad behavior, meant he was just trying to get attention,\n\nWhat other bad behavior?  Do you mean acting like a teen who wishes that just *once* his mother could put some effort into his acknowledging his existence?   Even if he had been looking for a bit of attention, punishing him by ignoring his plea for help was unconscionable.   You got angry when he called you out and and left him sick at school.  What lesson were you trying to teach there?   Because what I read was you telling him to shut up because you were already involved with Rachel.\n\n>He said if it was Rachel I wouldn't have made that assumption, though I assured him this wasn't true.\n\nThat was a lie and he knows it.  You did not make an \"honest\" mistake, you acted as you always do and downplayed what he was saying..   You think he's upset because he didn't get enough attention for graduating early?   Why would he feel that way?  What have you done to celebrate?   Are you having a party or even a cake?   What did you do beyond \"That's nice\", I have to take Rachel to an appointment?   From your post, it seems that you don't really want to give it too much attention because Rachel isn't doing as well as he in school.\n\nWhat are Vik's plans for post-graduation?   Do you even know?  Maybe he's wondering how he can possibly pursue his aspirations knowing that you will tell him you ~~can afford~~ won't be able to help him because you have to do so much for Rachel.   \n\nThis one incident is probably a just a slice of your son's everyday life.   You are far too used to making excuses.", "YTA absolutely. You've poisoned the relationship between your children and neglected your son. If he cuts contact with you the minute he's out of the house it will be deserved.", "YTA. \n\n*He said if it was Rachel I wouldn't have made that assumption, though I assured him this wasn't true.*\n\nBut he is right, you would never make an assumption that Rachel was making it up for attention. Imagine if the illness was serious and he was dead because of your assumption. Your neglect also is putting a wedge between Rachel and him. Also, there's been many similar stories on this with Reddit, so here's your future if this keeps up: He will move out and cut contact, he will get married and you won't be invited, and he will have kids whose lives you you will not be a part of. So do you like that?", "YTA. That was just mean. If you truly cared about your son you would\u2019ve taken him to the doctor anyway no matter what he said. What if he had a ruptured appendicitis? He could\u2019ve died you didn\u2019t know that And you didn\u2019t even care.\n\nTaking him after the fact Was just another snub you proved his point the daughter was more important just for an office visit. If you truly cared about him you would\u2019ve found out what was going on. I understand where he\u2019s coming from. Sounds like this has been his life. Oh daughters health is more important than sons. I get it he is being left out especially with a medical problem because daughters problems are more important", ">I tried to explain that his behavior recently is why I assumed he just wanted attention. He said if it was Rachel I wouldn't have made that assumption, though I assured him this wasn't true.\n\nYou're a liar. If it was your daughter you would've rush to the doctor because she have health issues. You clearly favor your daughter and you taught your son that he can't rely on you because he'll always be second, if he's polite enough and if you're in a good mood.\n\nI'll jump to conclusions too but honestly I won't be surprised if he's going NC as soon as he can. You're not a shitty parent but you admitted yourself that \"I'd be lying if I said Rachel's health hasn't taken precedence over everything else.\" He's probably feeling left out and forgotten because his sister's health is more important than him - and more important than his health since he called you because he felt sick and was in a lot of pain and you did... Absolutely nothing. As I said, don't be surprised if he decide to go NC with you when he'll leave.\n\nEdit: YTA of course.", "Of course YTA. You didn\u2019t even try to pretend to care about Vik.  I feel sorry for him. You clearly favor Rachel", "YTA..well? Was he wrong about you favoring her? About you assuming he was faking an illness until he got worse but wouldn't assume if it was Rachel? You really don't get it do you? You're 1 step away from having an estranged son cut you off from his life. Think about it.", "Obviously YTA. Your son had an illness bad enough that it warranted him calling you to pick him up when he likely knew that you were busy with Rachel and would be upset with him for asking. Rather than do that, you berated him for asking for support from his mother. More than that, you accused him of making up an illness so that you would give him attention as if that helps your case. If your child is desperate enough to FAKE AN ILLNESS to get your attention, you have not been a good parent to them. And he was even faking it, he was, in your words, \u201cgenuinely sick.\u201d Again, a good parent would not have doubted that their child was lying about an illness. \n\nI don't know where you are located but I'm assuming the US, so here are the facts: \n1. Rachel is legally an adult who can take care of her own medical needs, you weren't needed at the appointment.\n2. Your son called you, presumably in the afternoon, and you didn't check up on him until DINNER. \n3. You are so in denial about your blatant favoritism of Rachel that you were willing to put your son\u2019s health at risk because you were angry that he called you out on it. \n\nYou will be infinitely lucky if Vik decides to keep in contact with you when he graduates, but based on the way you've handled this whole situation I think you should prepare for the fact that you might never see him again once he graduates. \n\nYou are a huge, HUGE asshole.", "YTA, even if he was lying, it was a scream for attention. The fact he said he was in a lot of pain and you didn't even care, poor kid. I think what you did is beyond repair, you definitely wouldn't have made that assumption if it was Rachel.", "YTA. He's not going to forget this.", "YTA and I bet this kid goes no contact as soon as he can. Even the school could see he was in pain and you didn't consider him because you were so worried he was going to take attention away from Rachel.", "YTA. You clearly favored Rachel over Vik. You just taught Vik not to trust you anymore if you wanted to help him. There are some mistakes that are too late to make corrections on.", "Yeah YTA. Unless your kid has a history of faking sick there us no reason at all to ignore them when they say they are. He's right if it had been Rachel you wouldn't have questioned it. Also in case you've forgotten all teens get moody. So essentially you ignored your son being sick because he's been acting like every other teen I've ever known.", "YTA\u2026 My mother prettt much did this to me. Neglected getting me glasses because she thought I was lying to have them like my sister, I became chronically ill at 14 and she thought I wanted attention. I ended up having peptic ulcer disease, IBS, severe acid reflux\u2026POTS diagnosed at 19\u2026 and now a possible autoimmune disease\u2026you\u2019ve shown him he can\u2019t rely on you or trust you\u2026", "YTA \nThank God, you are not my mother. Even if I lied about being sick, my mom would still check on me the minute I said it. Why? Because she loves me, cares about me, worries about me. And you don't even have proof that your son was lying but still proceeded to ignore him. God, I have never seen a parent as cruel as you. What if , I mean what if he had died because of your neglect of his well being? Would you apologizing to him  bring him back? \nThere are so many people in this world who want children and would absolutely love them and treat them like treasure and here you are treating your son as trash. If you can't handle 2 kids then you shouldn't have given birth to another one. If there was a chance to change I really wish that he would not be born to a mother like you. You might be a good mom to your daughter but to your son - he would be better off without a so called \"mother\" like you.", "Assuming your child wasn\u2019t actually sick, and was \u201cjust\u201d seeking attention. \n\nGive your kid some freaking attention. Have a discussion with him about good/bad ways of looking for attention, but give it to him. Don\u2019t just reward the bad behavior, but figure out what is actually going on. \n\nWe all want to be acknowledge and recognized by the people we love. A 16 yr old kid misbehaving for attention is in desperate need. \n\nI have kids your kids\u2019 ages. I have found talking to them about things has been far more effective than punishments. Yes, there are sometimes consequences for actions, but usually, a conversation or two is enough. Finding out the WHY of behaviors, the root cause of them, will accomplish far more. Behaviors are a symptom and reacting to them is just putting a bandaid on them.", "YTA \n\nYou said flat out he is pushed to the side often by you. Even if he was just acting out for attention, maybe give it to him.", "YTA", "YTA. Being dismissed and not believed when you are ill has long term impacts, especially in the case where his needs have been deprioritized for years. Go to family therapy if you want to salvage it. And BE WILLING TO LISTEN TO HIS FEELINGS. Punishing him for his justified resentment and sadness is immature and selfish. If you want to repair things with him, you have to be willing to listen", "Hes not wrong because if it had been your daughter you wouldnt have questioned it, you would have taken her word for it and collected her.\n\nAt no point did you say, my sons behaviour includes pretending to be sick to gain attention so when he said he was sick why would you not believe him?\n\nYour response should have been, im sorry i cant pick you up straight away as im in the doctors but as soon as im finished i will come get you.\n\nTheres no making up to your kid the fact you called them a lier and really didnt give a fuck. \n\nActions speak louder than words and your action spoke volume.\n\nThis is on you so i really dnt know why your trying to put the blame on your son. If he hadnt have behaved like that, i wouldnt have behaved like this.", "YTA\n\nAs a fellow \"throw away child\" I can absolutely relate to what he must be feeling. \n\nOf course he acted out to get attention because he knew that was the only attention he was going to get, but for you to assume he was lying about being sick simply because he's been \"moody\" and that you wouldn't pick him up \"because of his attitude\" all you did was prove to him ONCE AGAIN that he's not as important as his sister.", "YTA - of course he's right ; it wasn't an 'honest mistake'.

They are turning into wonderful people and I\u2019m sure your son will as well.", "My parents always said they treated us equally. I knew I was the throwaway child, though. Even my friends would ask me why they gave my sister everything and me nothing, or why my parents didn\u2019t care when I was sick or hurt. It caused quite a lot of damage to me emotionally that I\u2019ll never get over.\n\nETA: And I was the sick one! I have chronic health issues, but I\u2019ve always had to deal with these on my own, even as a child.", "My sister hurt her back when she was 16 and I was 15.

The damage was and is real.", "Wow.. Honestly, geeze .. what kind of human being are you that will say something like this..  \n Are you are parent of a child that is chronically ill?     \nWhere do you \"see it all the time?\" What is your reference for such a statement?", "Unfortunately I believe it\u2019s too late because it\u2019s gone on for too long. The fact that she doesn\u2019t even care her son was in pain tells a lot. As a parent you have to be there for them no matter what.

Too many abbreviations these days lol", "Thanks for answering.. too many abbreviations to learn lol.. Appreciate your reply!", "TY.. Appreciate the reply!!", "> There is no correct/right thing.\n\nNot true.   The OP was so angry when Vik called out her favoritism that she *chose* to ignore his call and went to work rather than going to see whether he really had a problem.   There is no situation where that was acceptable.", "Thank you <3, I appreciate it.", "He let her know about her favoritism and she just brushed it off. In fact she got upset with him when he tried to get her help. He was sick he was frustrated and she chose not to help him.\n\nThat is the problem here and the fact that he even said that tells me that this has been a problem all his life with him he comes second even in a medical situation.\n\nIn this situation I think he knows he cannot depend on her any longer he will just have to take it upon himself to do what he thinks he needs to do with his health. She cannot be counted on in a bad situation he knows that. She can never say sorry enough to make this better. Giving him gifts isn\u2019t going to take away the hurt. What if he had died but she just say oh well I thought he was faking so I was busy with Rachel and couldn\u2019t get there no big deal right?\n\nAs a parent I would\u2019ve gone anyway no matter what was said as a mother I would\u2019ve at least followed up if she didn\u2019t feel that he needed her so she went back to work.

This is the problem and I\u2019m sure this has been a problem all his life", "My parents made many mistakes but when it came to my health or medical issues they dropped everything to make sure I was taken care of. He was in pain and asking for her help and she told him to screw off and went about her day.", "You told him that his recent behaviour is why you didn't believe him.\n\nThat's placing the blame on him.", "That is placing the blame on him that is why you didn\u2019t even bother to check up on him because he was being mean to you. Good parent no matter what will have a child\u2019s back and will be there for the child. But of course you only care about the daughter. You\u2019ve made that very clear.  you did place the blame on him by saying well he was being mean to me so I didn\u2019t go and help him. He\u2019s your child Even if he was faking it you should have gone to him and made sure he was OK. But you chose to just say oh screw him he\u2019s just faking it and went about your day.\n\nHe\u2019s right if it had been daughter you would\u2019ve drove 100 miles an hour to make sure she got to the doctor for a sinus infection but when he\u2019s in pain you could care less. You should\u2019ve at least checked up on him", "But you still put the blame on him with your \"I'm sorry but...\" apology.", "Did you ever deny your kids medical care? Or should I say one of your kids. Did you just blow them off as faking it? Did you not even care enough to talk to the school? Did you not even care to follow up?\n\nShe didn\u2019t care about him at all and that\u2019s What this is all about it\u2019s has nothing to do with the fact that she thought he was faking it. She placed the blame on him for being mean to her so she just said screw it I\u2019m going to work.\n\nThat is the issue she couldn\u2019t have cared any less. I sure hope you didn\u2019t do that to your kids.", "You read about that on this sub all the time with the parents crying I love my kids equally but their actions prove different", "As others who have lived it noted, this actually a very common scenario.  Having a chronically ill child doesn't mean you emotionally neglect your other children.   Making excuses for parents like this doesn't help anyone.", "As a parent and I have three kids I still no matter what they said to me would\u2019ve gone to make sure he was OK or if he had to go to the hospital. She didn\u2019t care. That\u2019s not a good parent especially a mother. You need to help your children when they need it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s obvious that he has been going through this all his life. Well I understand medical conditions take precedence but why is it only the The daughter who takes precedence for a medical condition and son can just deal with it on his own. She didn\u2019t care she went to work didn\u2019t even check up on him. He knows he can\u2019t depend on her", " i dont think they ment about a chronically ill child, i read it as when posts are made from a parent complaining my child thinks i favour their sibling but then goes on to state all the things they do to enforce that childs belief and then ends with i really dont understand why they feel this way! \n\n\"See it all the time\"  meaning on this sub. The reference being what i stated above, its what we read here!", "np fwiw iirc aiui iykwim ig", "Apologies.. but what do you mean by \"favoritism?\"   \n  \nI believe that OP stated that she was with \"Rachel\" at the doctors office.. The fact that the OP is clearly  asking for different perspective (as demonstrated by her post) you are clearly mis-reading/mis-interpreting what OP posted.   \n   \n \nBut thats just my perspective, and I think life is too complicated to make such statements as you did.!", "I dont know if my perspective is helpful, but please do not think that your relationship with \"Vik\" is irreparably damaged/in danger.

He wants you to know what he feels/is going through and now you know.   \n  \nDon't let this opportunity be wasted.. \n  \nMaybe im overthinking it.. but just my opinion!", "Yep 100%", "Making excuses? I don't believe I was making an excuse for the parent at all. I think what i was doing was sharing my perspective (in my responses). Also, I disagreed with the reply that the OP's relationship has ended with \"Vik\" and cannot be mended. Do you agree that the OP cannot have a relationship with her son, even thought she acknowledges her mistake?", "As a parent of three children, how many of them have chronic illnesses that require constant attention? As a mother, do you believe that there is no way for any parent/human being to mend a relationship with their child? DO you believe that even though the OP is asking for perspectives from people, means that she is   \n> not a good parent especially a mother \n>\n  \nI would love to read your book on how to deal with all situations, in all circumstances, in all issues for a mother to be a \"good parent.\" Such hubris,  you must honestly be amazing in all situations in all ways..", "OMG... please no\n... WHAT>>>>", "Yes, she was with Rachel and told him that she had no intention of doing anything to help him when that appointment was over.   She missed work for a planned appointment and didn't think it necessary to deal with her son's unexpected medical situation.

This just isn\u2019t a screwup this is a major f up. He can\u2019t depend on her and he knows that and she has proven that.\n\nHe\u2019s on his own and he knows it. And as soon as he can go on to college he won\u2019t need to worry about her anymore he will just take care of himself just like she wants him to", "She doesn't acknowledge her mistake, that's the problem.   She tries to justify her action and never acknowledges that her motives were fundamentally wrong.   She's only upset now because her reasoning had bad consequences for Vik.    \n\nThe mother/son relationship will not be irrevocably broken by this one incident.  Nor can it be mended by a flurry of superficial attention on the OP's part.  The first step in improving the relationship will before the OP be honest about the way she has been treating Vik all along.", "This is not about the daughters illness. It is about her son who was in pain and needed her and she decided because he was mean on the phone that he didn\u2019t matter and she went to work.\n\nHe needed her for a medical problem and she wouldn\u2019t even bother with him. That\u2019s the problem and I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time. I never said that the daughter Shouldn\u2019t be a priority at times, but she totally dismissed her son and his illness. She was too busy taking daughter to the doctor for a sinus infection which I\u2019ve had many and he was in pain and she didn\u2019t even care.\n\nThat is the problem here and again I\u2019m sure there are many other examples and I would love to hear his side.", "No problem, for what it's worth, if I recall correctly, as I understand it, if you know what I mean, I guess.", "OP is looking for perspective. Was this appointment with \"Rachel\"  scheduled? What do you know that the op hasn't posted?   \n \nI wonder what world I am living in when children lie about being sick.. and parents are wrong.
