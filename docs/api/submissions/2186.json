The entirety sensible - no, necessary - decision is not to go and expose your baby to the risk. If your Dad flips out and can\u2019t understand that, he\u2019s the AH, big time. There will be plenty more thanksgiving dinners you can all have together in the future.\n\nAs a side note - congratulations on the arrival of your little one, and here\u2019s hoping everything continues to go smoothly for you", "Absolutely definitely incontrovertibly NTA\n\nLots of parents wait three months before their babies go near crowds, and yours is so little. You are protecting your child. Full stop. No one gets to argue. \n\nAlso, congratulations on your new little human", "I work in an ED. RSV is horrible this year -- we've had newborns who have been intubated upon ED arrival..stay home. You are NTA for protecting your kiddo.", "NTA\n\nThe safety of your child aside, I cannot imagine wanting to attend any kind of function only a week after giving birth.", "NTA. Your a parent now -you have to do.what you feel is right for your child and, as an adult, you don't owe your parents doing what they think you should do. You don't even need a justification - you and your wife could easily just say that you're exhausted from just having a baby and that would be enough of a reason for you to change your plans. You and she need to be comfortable making choices for your family even if it makes other people unhappy. \n\nAlso, RSV and flu and covid and etc are huge issues right now. In my city the children's hospital is filled to capacity and turning away families who have children with respiratory issues. I'm in the southwestern United States but I think that's probably the case in a lot of places. Protecting your newborn, especially a premature newborn, is crucial.\n\nIt's definitely an adjustment and being a parent is wonderful, but it's also a job that constantly calls on you to set boundaries and you have to be comfortable with people being angry with you. That doesn't necessarily mean that you did anything wrong. You're on the right track just trust yourself. Your family can deal with their own feelings.", "NTA. Congratulations on your son! Taking care of him and what he needs to stay healthy is number one priority.", "NTA. You\u2019re being a responsible parent and protecting your child while they are vulnerable.", "NTA- protecting your child\u2019s health trumps everyone else\u2019s feelings.", "NTA.  Most people do not have their newborns around people until they are at least 2 months old.  They are new to this world.  They don't have a fully developed immune system, so even a common cold can be bad for them.   Use zoom or some other way to be there, but do not take the chance of getting your baby sick by going in person.   Thanksgiving will be here next year and the year after.   Right now, your main job is to protect that precious baby of yours.", "NTA : just be upfront about your reasoning- no excuses or trying to make it politically correct. Just hey dad, your Thanksgiving is always cool with allot of people, my baby is fragile. Can't make this one, but hopefully we can get together next time.", "NTA. Babies shouldn\u2019t be exposed to absolutely every person you know until they\u2019re about 6 weeks old and have another round of vaccinations.", "NTA.  Any one week old baby is too young for family gatherings outside of the family they live with.", "Nope. NTA", "NTA stick with your guns.", " NTA you gotta do what\u2019s best for your family.", "NTA.

You're starting baby's life off being good parents already. Baby is lucky to have caring parents. Plus Thanksgiving is a lousy holiday anyway. You'll have plenty of time to celebrate every holiday, big and small, once your baby has an immune system that can do so safely.", "NTA. Your child is at higher risk and it\u2019s not worth putting their health in danger for. There is always next thanksgiving.", "NTA, explain that it is for the little one, as a dad he hopefully understands.", "NTA.\n\nBaby\u2019s and your immediate families health is way more important than potentially hurting feelings.", "The fact that you have a 1 week old is a good enough reason to opt out. If he weighed a perfect 8.5 and was born on his due date you\u2019d still be well within your rights (and the realm of normal) to stay home. Your wife is 1 week out from either pushing out a baby or literally having 1 cut out of her, why would anyone be upset that group socializing isn\u2019t high on the to do list.

I have a 5, 3 and almost 2 year old and rsv season this year is worse than it normally is. My oldest started Headstart last year and brought rsv home last year when my youngest was 11 months old and while I\u2019m grateful that none of my kids got it too bad and there were no hospitalization required for any of them it was still terrible to deal with especially with all 3 of them having it at once. I\u2019m still extremely angry at the fact that someone sent their kid to school with it.", "NTA. It would not be safe or responsible to bring a baby that young around a bunch of people right now. RSV is not messing around. A preemie is at even got a risk. Your family needs to sit it out this year and that's fine. Have a happy Thanksgiving and enjoy your quieter time with your new baby. And congratulations!", "NTA, and *please* do not put worry about being an asshole.  Newborns, especially low birth weight preemies, are fragile and you won't forgive yourself if he gets terribly sick from a minor bug that would barely inconvenience your cousins.

Your top priority should always be the health and safety of your child.", "NTA!

Valid health concerns aside since you're already aware of those, you're parents to a few week old baby at that point and will likely be exhausted.

In a few days say sorry dad we can't come saw the dr today and he/she said (insert best sounding excuse).", "NTA.  My preemie twins were born in mid December.  We skipped the extended family Christmas gatherings that year, and this was even pre-Covid.  Everyone was understanding and supportive.", "NTA, do Not go there. Where I live all visits are kept to an absolute minimum the first six weeks of a child's life, because their immunity is basically nonexistent. This is especially the case with a small premature child. Anyone criticising you for this doesn't understand babies or doesn't have your son's interest at heart", "Of course you\u2019re not TA. If you\u2019re afraid of your father\u2019s reaction (get therapy!) then tell him that THE PEDIATRICIAN forbade you to have the baby around anyone from outside your household.   Make the doctor the bad guy, but also stop being afraid of your parents. You\u2019re allowed to say no and you don\u2019t need to JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain).", "No, of course NTA.  An infant that was premature and is just a few weeks old does not belong at a gathering and the parents of the infant should not be leaving him so you obviously aren't going anywhere. Why are people so uptight about this? It's just one Thanksgiving. There will be another next year.  Get takeout and watch Charlie Brown and be thankful for your new son.  Btw, 50 years ago a 7 lb baby was considered huge and all the 6 pound babies grew up and were just fine. He'll be fine.", "NTA and protecting a fragile newborn. Congrats on his birthday and I hope he grows up big and strong.", "NTA, I find it weird when I see parents with newborns in crowded and noisy places. I waited until my kids were at least 3 months until I brought them out into the world. Right now there's just too many bugs for it to be safe for a newborn.", "NTA. Your baby , your rules. I'm sure your pediatrician would recommend that you avoid crowds, etc, basically anyone not living in your house.", "NTA this is your child and your decision.

You\u2019re being a good and responsible dad.", "NTA.

With this RSV going around, you can't be too careful.", "NTA. Safety of your bubby must always come first. If he gets upsets for your reasons then ask him if he cares about his grandchild, if he says yes then tell him thank you I knew you'd understand.

Your top priority should always be the health and safety of your child.", "Agreed, NTA. I work my hospitals inpatient pharmacy and the amount of kids coming in had been ridiculous this year.
