Even if RSV rates weren't so high right now, I probably wouldn't risk that big of a holiday event with your baby.", "I am literally in this situation. Had my first baby 1 week ago. He was full term, nearly 9 lbs., and I would not go to a big family thanksgiving with him! We are maybe spending thanksgiving with my parents, who have been essentially quarantining themselves to protect the baby. But my mom said she\u2019d be happy to serve me thanksgiving in bed if it\u2019s too much to come over. Giving birth is no joke on a body! And RSV/COVID are real concerns right now. OP\u2019s responsibility is to protect his baby, not please his family.", "Ps congratulations!", "Right! It\u2019s a hot ass mess in the best of conditions. I had a very smooth pregnancy and delivery and the idea of a having to put on real clothes and socialize and have people breathing on/over my baby, hard pass!", "You have a smart and caring mom\ud83d\ude42"]}
