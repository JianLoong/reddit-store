We are maybe spending thanksgiving with my parents, who have been essentially quarantining themselves to protect the baby. But my mom said she\u2019d be happy to serve me thanksgiving in bed if it\u2019s too much to come over. Giving birth is no joke on a body! And RSV/COVID are real concerns right now. OP\u2019s responsibility is to protect his baby, not please his family.", "Ps congratulations!", "Right! It\u2019s a hot ass mess in the best of conditions. I had a very smooth pregnancy and delivery and the idea of a having to put on real clothes and socialize and have people breathing on/over my baby, hard pass!", "You have a smart and caring mom\ud83d\ude42", "NTA. A case of RSV put my kid on life support and changed our lives forever, so I'm a bit biased, but DON'T KISS THE BABIES", "NTA. My son was born 4 days before Thanksgiving last year and I went to my parents house for the holiday. It was hard with a newborn and still figuring out breastfeeding with no sleep. Without the risk of sickness, just having a baby was hard enough.", "NTA When our son was born 5 weeks early in December, we didn\u2019t do any gatherings until April. We didn\u2019t have a bunch of family coming over either. This was before Covid even existed. Our family understood. I can\u2019t believe anyone living today would begrudge you this. Between Covid, flu, and rsv, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d attend Thanksgiving with a newborn. And it\u2019s not just kids you have to worry about getting rsv from. Adults can have it with very mild symptoms and pass it to your baby. \n\nMy \u201cpreemie\u201d is 21 now and we have no regrets about isolating him those first few months.", "NTA and please don't take your child anywhere nor allow anyone to come to your house, not until LO has had their first round of vaccines.  Let dad and anyone else flip out.  Who cares?  You are ensuring the health and safety of your child.", "Definitely NTA\n\nNewborns are vulnerable, it's the responsible decision.", "NTA.  Your wife and child should not be traveling.  Baby should not be around people especially kids.  Holy crap. My 14 yo has basically been sick since late September due to being back full time at in-person school without masks.  My coworkers\u2019 kids have all been sick constantly, too.  Start new traditions for your new family.", "NTA. It's a bad RSV season and people seem to forget that Covid is still a thing. Your baby needs to build up his immune system before getting passed around to the whole family. Stay home and be safe.", "NTA. Welcome to parenthood. You\u2019re doing great!", "NTA at all, you would be the AH if you dragged a newborn out to a big gathering!\n\nWould it be helpful reframing it as an Obviously when you let him know you're not going? As in \"Hi dad, *obviously* for little one's health we're not going out anywhere for thanksgiving but just wanted to say we'll be thinking of you all. Hope you all have a great day!\"\nHopefully your dad wouldn't be arguing anyway but this just gently emphasises the point.", "NTA, I had my baby in August. She was 2.5months old at Canadian Thanksgiving. Cousins kid was getting over covid and let us know before we all got together. We did not go, everyone who did got covid! Protect that baby!!", "NTA - \"Dad, we can't come to your place for Thanksgiving.  Dr's orders, you understand.  I hope you have a wonderful time and give everyone our love.\"  If they get wind of her parents coming over \"yeah, they'll be by to help us out.  Not a big deal.\"  Then order out Chinese, because I can bet that Mom doesn't want to be cooking more than a cup of coffee.", "NTA. It's what you should do, your moral responsibility is to protect your baby, going to this event would not be doing that. If your dad starts to flip out just hang up on him if that bothers you, because he has no reason to be angry when you're trying to keep your baby alive.\n\nAlso congratulations on your itty bitty baby", "NTA. Remember to wash hands. No kissing. If anyone has any bit of sickness coming on, skip the visit all together! COVID is still around so a rapid test isn\u2019t a bad idea too. Get your flu shots.", "I had my oldest 6 weeks early and he was that same size! That is a tiny previous newborn that needs to be protected! NTA", "NTA any reasonable person would expect you to stay home for probably several weeks or months with your tiny baby.\n\nThe global dare not speak its name does exist still, childrens hospitals are fighting RSV, plus it\u2019s flu season.  Also school age kids are little germ monsters.\n\nWithout those three things your little fighter needs extra TLC and protection. Frame it as \u201cobviously we\u2019re not going to be able to attend thanksgiving with little guys early arrival, what time would you like to video call so everyone can see the baby\u201d and get one of those cheap newborn holiday onesies so everyone can coo.", "NTA, protecting a newborn from illness sounds like a reasonable reason to stay away this year.  His immune system has not had time to fully develop.  also,  i'm sure your wife is still a little sore too.", "NTA and a good mother.", "Right now, we are at the beginning of a really dangerous season for 3 different viruses: flu, RSV, the beer virus. Even a heathy 10lb baby would be at risk. All 3 of those can kill, especially a small baby that pretty much has zero immune system. We have a baby who will be 7 months next week. We don\u2019t take him anywhere we don\u2019t need to take him. He\u2019s been to Costco and target, but at times when there aren\u2019t as many people. We aren\u2019t going to be taking him out to places like that on Black Friday. He goes to a daycare where he and his older siblings are the only ones there. \n\nWe are doing what is best for him. You are doing what is best for your baby. Never let other people try to shame you for protecting your child. \n\nNTA", "NTA: I work at a larger hospital in the southwestern part of the country and we are being bombarded with RSV/rhino virus/flu/croup and bronchiolitis in the ERs and units. Newborns are being intubated and placed on ventilators then requiring high oxygen demands and devices after they come off. Some have issues with feeding and digesting, as well among other things. Bigger kids are getting really sick as well but most get better without intensive intervention. Smaller babies, not so much, and the lack of hospital beds, staff, and docs to take care of these sick kiddos in the pediatric and neonatal ICUs is scary. This is the worst I\u2019ve see for babies and kids in the last five years. Protect your precious new human and to hell with what your family thinks. If they can\u2019t understand then they are the assholes and don\u2019t deserve to even meet your new bundle later on.", "NTA.\nyou're protecting your new baby and being good parents!\nAny decent person will understand.\nCongratulations on your bundle of joy :)", "NTA\n\nSo what your dad flips out. You just became a parent yourself. Your priority is your son. Your world revolves around your son and his needs.\n\nAnd absolutely protect your premature baby from large groups and any families with kids. Wait longer for any of them to visit too. If you cant do Christmas either you cant do it. If you have to exclude anyone with kids so be it.", "NTA at all\n\nYou might want to talk further with your pediatrician about your baby\u2019s weight. I\u2019m not a medical professional, but everything I can find puts 5.9 pounds in the normal weight range for a newborn and says three weeks early is still considered full term.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should bring your baby to Thanksgiving regardless, but it sounds like you\u2019re worried due to his size. While he\u2019s on the smaller side, he doesn\u2019t seem to be an abnormally small.", "NTA. Undeniably and irrefutably NTA. Your main priority should always be to keep your children safe, even if that means upsetting or offending others. It is completely on them if they can\u2019t/won\u2019t understand your stance. Honestly, it shows either their lack of care for your baby or at the very minimum their lack of understand of how immune systems work. \n\nMy baby is due about a week before Christmas- so like you, we will not be toting her around to all of our family gatherings. Sure, some family members are upset and think that we\u2019re being dramatic or protective. But, I couldn\u2019t care less. The only thing I care about is keeping my baby girl safe and healthy. Also, to be honest I\u2019m looking forward to a quiet holiday season with my little family. \n\nCongrats on the baby, OP!", "I mean, who da fuq cares if your dad freaks out? You have a premature baby and it's RSV and COVID season. What's more important, the health of your child, or soothing your dad's tantrum? NTA", "NTA. You would be an asshole to allow a newborn baby to be possibly exposed to RSV. Your job is to protect your kid, your dad's opinion does not matter any longer.", "Bro of course you're NTA. Do what is best for the baby, period.", "NTA.\n\nIf he flips, put it this way to him: he's sacrificing one Thanksgiving to have multiple others with his grandkid later.", "NTA. If you went, YWBTA. It\u2019s irresponsible to take a prematurely born baby to a gathering like that so soon. Your instincts as a mom are your best tool right now - listen to them, because they\u2019re spot on so far!", "NTA, you're taking reasonable measures to ensure the health of your preemie baby. My daughter came along early by an entire month, she was all of 4lb13oz. She was so tiny she rattled even in preemie clothes! Smallest baby on the ward, and one woman had premature twins!\n\nThey are so fragile at that age, exposing your baby to so many people is simply too much of risk. Especially other children! No matter how hard you try, children are basically walking petri dishes!\n\nYou have a vulnerable child, you are protecting your baby from possible harm. Good for you!", "NTA. You have a new baby. That\u2019s more than enough reason to say no to doing anything, no other reason necessary.\n\nCongratulations on the new little one!", "Nta. Keep that baby away from germs for at least 6 months. And congrats.", "NTA. You are doing what's best for your baby so they can be around for future thanksgivings.", "NTA\n\nThe babies need to stay inside with parents for first few weeks.  RSV is on highest list of children's ailment lately.  Your dad needs to understand why.  Show him the google about RSV, hope he'll understand.", "NTA. My second kid get RSV at 4 weeks of age. At that young, their immune system can\u2019t necessarily contain an infection. So he had to be hospitalized for two days. Given RSV is huge now (after being suppressed for 2.5 years because of Covid social distancing).", "NTA at all. \n\nMy youngest was born full term. And caught RSV from my 7yo daughter when he was 2 weeks old. \n\nIt was so scary. And I was an experienced mom of two with a background as an EMT and watching my baby struggle to breath was the worst feeling ever. \n\nHe wasn't even sniffling. But when I took his onesy off to bath him, he was using accessory muscles to breath. Went to the doctors and he was admitted directly from the doctors to the hospital. \n\nHe spent 7 days in an O2 tent in the hospital. We had to set up blow by O2 when he nursed. He had Respiratory Therapy every two hours. \n\nWhen we got home we still had to do the treatments every two hours round the clock. \n\nHis was considered an \"uncomplicated\" case. He never had to be intubated. \n\nHe then struggled with \"reactive airway\" through most of his baby years. He is fine now but has developed asthma. \n\nPlease don't risk it. At 7 my daughter was totally fine. She didn't appear sick, she had a mild case of the sniffles. It wasn't like she had a visibly bad cold or even appeared sick. No fever. \n\nInfact she had just been to the doctors for a check up, no one told me about the risk of RSV because my son did not fall into an \"at risk\" category at the time. (18years ago) \n\nTell your father that you are giving up this ONE holiday to ensure your child has the opportunity for many, many more.", "Too many unwashed hands, coughing, sneezing, for a preemie to endure. Even contracting a mild cold would be tough on them (and you as parents).", "Yo, and also the family expecting you to attend. You just went through a major medical event, it doesn't make sense", "3 weeks after giving birth, and how many people with 1 or 2 bathrooms? Nope.\n\nNTA", "RSV has been huge in our city the past three months. My daughter caught it and she couldn't breathe without getting dizzy. I can't imagine exposing a newborn to that just to make others happy. NTA in any way.", "It's all over -- I'm in a city on the east coast and the hospital where I work is over 100 percent capacity -- 2 kids in single rooms, kids in beds in the hallway.", "I was in a very similar position 18 years ago. My gut was screaming don\u2019t take 1 month old to my uncle\u2019s for Thanksgiving. \n\nI asked my pediatrician if I was crazy. Pediatrician, an absolute believer in Mom Gut, asked how strongly I wanted the letter worded.  The office had 2 flavors 1. In my medical opinion child should not go, for sensible but excited families. 2. Attending is medical negligence for sick children and crazy families. \n\nDH took copy of version 1 with him to dinner. Amazing how Dr orders in writing shut people down.", "Exactly this. My doctor straight up told me she is happy to be the \"bad guy\" in these situations. I'm sure most doctors feel the same way.", "I'm not American but I gather thanksgiving is a big deal there. Thanksgiving is supposed to be to remember generosity and kindness yet the hate I am seeing being placed on posters on here by people who are supposed to be their family is insane. If it matters more to you to be seem to have a full table at Thanksgiving rather than having your grandchild not die because their immune system is not able to fight yet is mind-boggling to me", "American and this is still moronic.  It comes down to crazy families, not crazy Americans.  Unfortunately, we have both.", "Oh there's crazy people elsewhere too. But you can't talk about us Irish people being crazy at Thanksgiving when we don't have that particular event, in fairness \ud83e\udd23 we're just seeing a massive increase in the insane Americans this week as it's that thanksgiving. Last month the Canadian lunatic families were on blast for theirs. Since, obviously, no one else does this, we don't see other versions of this event elsewhere"]}
