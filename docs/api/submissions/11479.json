He did not invite me to several of the various celebrations that followed, despite other spouses/significant others attending. He said it didn\u2019t occur to him, which really hurt me.

It\u2019s just a guy that takes his spouse for granted or he\u2019s trying to send a bigger message. But he sent a message. He didn\u2019t treat your relationship with any kind of value.

That's what happened to me.  The original plan was once she got her degree I would stop work and go to school full time myself.  So after a ten year relationship, where I supported my ex both emotionally and financially: I took care of all the chores around the house, helped her with her homework, I stopped going to school myself so I could work sixty hours a week to cover all the bills, cooked all our meals, did all the shopping.  She literally didn't have to lift a finger for anything that wasn't school related.  She got an internship with Disney during our last year together and she took that opportunity to find someone else she really wanted to be with.  \n\nThen during her last semester before graduation she filed for divorce and admitted she never had actually wanted to be with me.  At this point she literally told me the only reason she originally started dating me to try to make her ex jealous so he would want to get back together with her and then when that didn't work she only stayed with me because she didn't want to take care of herself and for the vast majority of our relationship she had been cheating on me.\n\nShe is not what I would call a good person.", "Clearly either one of or both posts is fiction but how the hell could anyone not smell that a cat had shit under their bed?!", "NTA move on dear he is not worth it", "NTA and run, now. \n\nThis self-centered.egotist probably just doesn't want to show up without a date at his graduation but is going to dump you first chance he gets.", "Nta and no offense but do you want to stay with him?

You probably made it easier on him by cooking meals, cleaning, being his sounding board... And now he doesn't need you. NTA but I don't think this relationship is continuing.", "Agreed. I hope you are wrong as well, but I was thinking the exact same thing. It is easier to have a steady life living with a SO while studying and not having to think about the SO or relationship. Have seen it a few times. \n\nBesides, if you do love your SO and you mention everyone then it is weird you don\u2019t mention your SO. Especially when they supported you through the 4 years. I mentioned my SO who was then cheering me on during my last year of studies. We only were a couple for one year then. We are still together.", "I'm sorry that happened to you."]}
