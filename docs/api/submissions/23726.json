OP, here's my hot take: your husband's behavior shows emotional immaturity with a sprinkle of negging.

I told him that I didn't like the nickname over and over, but he would giggle, smirk, and say, \"Well, *I* like it,\" as if that overrode any feelings that I had. I was young, so in the end, I rolled my eyes and let it go. Looking back, I can see that my ex's choice to keep calling me a nickname that he knew I hated was emblematic of the way that he viewed our entire relationship: only his feelings really mattered, my consent was optional, and making me unhappy was fine as long as it got him something that he wanted. \n\nYour story also reminds me of how my ex would behave whenever he knew that he'd done something wrong. He'd sort of pout and slink off. When he thought that I wasn't mad anymore, he'd reappear but never apologize.\n\nI'm not saying that you should dump your husband over this, but please do take it seriously. I think you should have a serious sit-down conversation with him and insist that he explain to you why he's decided that your feelings don't matter.", "NTA. Maybe ask him why he does it, and continues to do it when you\u2019ve asked him not to?", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't really yell or anything, just told him you're tired of his lame joke and don't want to hear it anymore.
