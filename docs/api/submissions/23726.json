Better be careful, you\u2019re gonna get addicted.\u201d It\u2019s not funny and never has been and I\u2019ve told him that before. I do think he\u2019s trying to be funny but it\u2019s just annoying and an eye roll. This has been going on for years. I don\u2019t have a history of addiction. \n\nToday, I\u2019m going through a painful gynecological procedure due to some iffy test results. This test could show if I have cancer, precancerous cells, or nothing abnormal at all and I\u2019ve been incredibly stressed about what the findings will show, especially because I lost my mom to a gynecological cancer last year. \n\nMy doctor prescribed a painkiller to take before the procedure. I won\u2019t need anything after, so it\u2019s literally one pill. I filled the prescription last night and the pill bottle came with a label that says \u201copioid: risk of overdose and addiction\u201d even though it\u2019s only the one pill because that label goes on all opioids. My husband saw the bottle and, of course, made a joke about how I\u2019m going to get addicted. This was also in front of our son.\n\nI waited until our son left the room and told him I\u2019m sick and tired of hearing that bullshit joke and if he wants to actually make a joke, he should at least try to be funny. I didn\u2019t raise my voice or anything like that, but I was very stern and clearly unhappy. He\u2019s been cold and distant since. \n\nAITAH for calling him out and saying that he\u2019s not funny? I feel like it would have been better to let it go but I\u2019m so stressed about this procedure that I reacted viscerally. I know he was trying to be funny and lighten the mood but it\u2019s unfunny. I\u2019m the type of person who loves to joke around but not at someone\u2019s expense in a way that will hurt their feelings.", "created_utc": 1690990116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gbwub/aitah_for_calling_my_husband_out_on_his_unfunny/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I sincerely hope that everything goes well and ends with good news.", "That joke is not funny and is particularly unfunny in the context you describe and is doubly especially unfunny to make in front of your son, who now has to worry about his mother undergoing a procedure and becoming a substance abuser. \n\nHe should be supporting you at the moment. He's being a terrible, awful partner and parent.", "NTA. Unfunny jokes like that are passive aggression. He's just being an annoying pest, you're right to point it out if he can't realize it himself.", "NTA. Your husband has the emotional range of an teaspoon. Tell him to take his jokes back to middle school.\n\nHope the result of the test goes well.", "NTA. There\u2019s times to poke fun and use stupid dad jokes, even if it annoys the shit out of you. Poking at your wife who is about to have a very stressful procedure that could possibly have very serious outcomes that is also linked to past trauma is just possibly the top 5 absolute worst times to do it, probably up there with funeral.", "NTA. You've told him over and over again. Have you ever asked him why he feels it's okay to dismiss your feelings and keep crossing your boundaries? Might be interesting to see what his response is!", "NTA but your husband is.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s time to have a serious conversation about this \u201cjoke\u201d, especially if it\u2019s due to misguided concerns because of your father.\n\nWait for a neutral time and then try to figure out what your husband is actually trying to say here. Even if he\u2019s truly trying to tell a joke the fact that he keeps repeating it knowing you\u2019re not laughing is something that needs to be addressed.\n\nWishing you the best results in your test.

Good luck for the procedure/test. It does sound very stressful. It happens in all relationships. We keep something bottled up and then it comes out a bit strong at the wrong time under stress. A bit of unsolicited advice below, ignore it if you're not up for it right now. \n\nWhile you are NTA, sitting down with your husband after your medical stuff is done with a calm and clear mind (hopefully that's possible) is a good idea. You can start by admitting that it came out wrong or a bit too harsh then what you meant it to be but that you genuinely don't appreciate those addiction jokes. Hopefully your husband will be mature enough to understand that.", "\"My wife is going through something incredibly frightening so instead of being supportive I'm going to say something I know she finds annoying and offensive IN FRONT OF OUR CHILD.\" Someone is the AH here", "NTA\n\nThat sounds super annoying", "NTA  \n\n\nYou don't find the joke funny, you have never found the joke funny, and the night before an invasive and painful procedure is not the time to pull out the old saw he knows you hate.  That's the opposite of supportive, and honestly he would be in the doghouse with me.", "A joke is only a joke if both people are laughing", "NTA. Next time he makes that \u201cjoke\u201d I would look at him and just calmly say \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware addiction was funny\u201d and walk away.", "NTA. I don't think you need to apologise. You didn't shout, you just made yourself clear and it made him listen finally. You have nothing to take back. The joke became a symbol of him not hearing you the first (second,third) time you say something.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds very narcissistic behaviour...trying to shame or undermine you and make you feel wrong about yourself.\n\nJust respond with \"If you can't respect my health issues and be supportive, then don't say anything about them at all\"\n\nThe thing is...(from experience) people like this don't like to see you having fun without them, so try and belittle you.", "NTA\n\nThat joke isn't very funny.  In certain circles, it could be insulting as hell.", "NTA. You told your husband that you didn\u2019t like it still he kept repeating the joke.", "NTA. You can only repeat yourself so many times before it\u2019s going to get a more aggressive reaction. He should be supporting you through this obviously stressful time, not making jokes in the first place. Let alone an annoying unfunny joke you\u2019ve repeatedly asked him to stop making", "Nta that was a completely inappropriate joke to make at the most inappropriate time, even if you did find it funny all those other times.", "NTA. That is a disrespectful phrase when used to both an addict and a non addict. If theres no history of addiction he\u2019s an AH. Does he want you in pain? \n\nOn the other hand\u2026I would think that phrasing originated from something in his life. Possibly someone else close with addiction? \n\nEither way. He shouldn\u2019t use it as a joke if you don\u2019t find it funny. This really is about his lack of support as well. Seems to have the emotional maturity of a rock. Couldn\u2019t he say \u201cI\u2019m happy for you\u201d for the game or \u201cI\u2019m worried about you\u201d for the procedure? Tell knock knock jokes or something.", "NTA, you have been frustrated for a while due to this so i don't blame you, but i would apologize anyway because you were too harsh when he was just trying to lighten the mood", "NTA.  That isn't funny, and hearing someone say the same unfunny thing over and over is obnoxious.  You told him it isn't funny, he can figure out something else to say, or nothing at all.", "NTA. OP, here's my hot take: your husband's behavior shows emotional immaturity with a sprinkle of negging. I say this because your story reminds me of an ex that I had who liked to call me by a certain nickname that I found embarrassing. I told him that I didn't like the nickname over and over, but he would giggle, smirk, and say, \"Well, *I* like it,\" as if that overrode any feelings that I had. I was young, so in the end, I rolled my eyes and let it go. Looking back, I can see that my ex's choice to keep calling me a nickname that he knew I hated was emblematic of the way that he viewed our entire relationship: only his feelings really mattered, my consent was optional, and making me unhappy was fine as long as it got him something that he wanted. \n\nYour story also reminds me of how my ex would behave whenever he knew that he'd done something wrong. He'd sort of pout and slink off. When he thought that I wasn't mad anymore, he'd reappear but never apologize.\n\nI'm not saying that you should dump your husband over this, but please do take it seriously. I think you should have a serious sit-down conversation with him and insist that he explain to you why he's decided that your feelings don't matter.", "NTA. Maybe ask him why he does it, and continues to do it when you\u2019ve asked him not to?", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't really yell or anything, just told him you're tired of his lame joke and don't want to hear it anymore. If he says anything about what you said, just tell him \"Well maybe I'm addicted to thinking your jokes suck\".\n\nEdit: I just realized I put tell instead of yell.", "NTA - addiction jokes aren\u2019t funny", "Is he trying to plant seeds of addiction in your mind? I\u2019m genuinely so confused as to why he keeps specifically saying that.", "NTA He\u2019s passive aggressive. He knows you hate it but does it anyway. Saying it during a situation like this was horrible. Glad you told him off.", "Ask him to expand his joke library because the one he's been telling is old and stale. NTA.", "Sounds to me like he thinks it\u2019s an ongoing inside joke between both of you.\n\nHow serious did you sound the previous times you told him it wasn\u2019t funny? It\u2019s pretty common for people to react with \u201cstop it that\u2019s not funny\u201d with wind up/teasing jokes of that nature without actually meaning it. Is it possible he thought this was the case?\n\nIf so, he\u2019s going to be feeling pretty blindsided.

You probably should just let it go, accept it as one of his annoying quirks (we all have them), roll your eyes when he says it, but otherwise ignore it.

It doesn't lighten the mood, it just feels like being poked at when all you want is a bit of a rest.", "This. There could be a myriad of reasons why the husband reacts in this way with the joke - a reflection of his own feelings about hobbies and how parents and partners spend time, a reaction to his childhood, a worry about his own predilection towards addictive behaviours, attempting to minimise fears about his wife\u2019s health, just being a shitty comedian.\n\nNone of those in the moment alter the fact that a fucking hug would go miles further though. \n\nIf he\u2019s being cold and distant, OP it may be worth, after kids are sorted and the house is quiet, talking to him about how you feel and how scared you are, and how scared he is too.
