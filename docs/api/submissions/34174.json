I live 2,500 miles away from her, and so does my sister in a different location. My mom is the most loving and kindhearted person you\u2019ll ever meet. We call either daily or every other day to catch up, tell her I love and miss her etc. I\u2019ve been flying to go see my family probably once every three months. \n\nI\u2019ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend (27M) (whom I moved to my current location to be with 2.5 years in after long distance) for 5 years now. He\u2019s ready to get married, but i don\u2019t think i am. He wants me to cut down how often I go to see my family. He\u2019s made it very clear that he has to take precedence over anyone else when we\u2019re married, even asked who I\u2019d go see if both him and my mom were dying at the same time. I know that getting married means you\u2019re making your own family, but I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m ready to let go of my mom. Especially being so far away from her, watching her grow older and knowing that she\u2019s going to pass away eventually makes me emotional, I feel like I need to get in as much time as I can with her. My boyfriend\u2019s mom passed away when he was young, and his dad and him aren\u2019t very close. He never got to experience what I did growing up, and it breaks my heart. And it\u2019s causing a difference in views. To me, my partner is my number one already. I moved out here away from my family to be with him, I cancelled a trip to see my family this year because he needed me, I will literally drop anything if he needs me. He is my whole heart. He does the same, but I think he feels like he\u2019s runner up to my mom, but the truth is that I couldn\u2019t ever decide. I love him with all of my heart, as well as my mom.

But 3-4 times a year is perfectly reasonable (as long as you can afford it). \n\nYou say that your boyfriend has no close family. Here's the Big Question: does he have friends that he spends time with? Or does he expect you to spend all your time with him? Are you allowed to have female friends with whom you get to spend time apart from him?\n\nIf the answers to these questions are No, Yes, and No, then **please think hard about this relationship**.\n\nWhen a person does not have any friends, it is a *huge* warning signal. Emotionally-healthy people have friends in addition to their significant other, and they do ***not*** expect their partner to spend time alone with them 24/7.\n\nEmotionally-healthy people do not force their partners to choose between them and their family. That is something that controlling, abusive partners do. And it sounds as though your boyfriend is already working hard at trying to isolate you from your family. He's already made you cancel a visit to your family by guilt-tripping you, and he's demanding that you choose between him and your family.\n\n**A good partner will** ***never*** **demand that you choose one or the other.** A good partner knows that it is reasonable and healthy for someone to have a relationship and still spend time with their family as well.\n\nPlease, please think hard about whether this is what you want for a relationship.", "NTA, please do not marry him...it sounds like he has emotional attachment issues with you that are not healthy. He's controlling, and that most definitely WILL only get worse. What sicko asks someone who they'd choose if both their partner and mother were dying!? He is already forcing your hand, and your cancelling trips may seem innocent, but he's succinctly already making you change plans, etc, to suit his needs. Your mother will become a huge bone of contention, and you will be utterly miserable because you are stuck in the middle. He either needs to realise how special your mother is to you or this may be a road to nowhere. Perhaps some serious soul searching for you is in order?", "NTA. But that man is trying to isolate you. \n\nNo real man wants his partner to cut off perfectly healthy familial relationships. \n\nHe is not the right guy for you if he has all these expectations and demands from you.", "NTA. Red alert! I'm getting controlling vibes off this guy. You have been long distance, you move to him, he wants to get married, he doesn't want you to visit Mum... OK, it's early warning signs, but this is always a worry. Yes, a couple should move away from their parents, should be more independent. However it's a balance. Phone calls every day or two should be ok, assuming you still have time for BF. Visits home should not be cancelled unless they really interfere with the relationship. I'd go slow here, and watch that he is not slowly isolating you.", "NTA.\n\nHe sounds manipulative as heck. Re-read that bit about how he wants you to spend less time with your family, or how he's making a hypothetical situation about whose death is more important. Is that loving and caring, or is that control and forcing you into isolation?\n\nI would advise making an exit strategy that keeps you safe, and seriously reconsider if you want your life to be controlled by him. This hesitation to get married is because you know this is wrong and off.", "He will never understand your connection to your mom, and it will always be a bone of contention if you marry him. It will not get better. Also, you are only 22. And you probably need more experience dating. You got locked down pretty young. You need to experience more life before getting married, and marry someone who isn\u2019t stupid enough to ask you the \u201cwho would you save\u201d question. Good Lord that is a huge red flag.", "NTA\n\n>I\u2019ve been flying to go see my family probably **once every three months.**\n\nThat's not much. Your partner seems to be jealous and controlling. \"To take precedence over anyone else\" doesn't mean \"to be the center of the universe.\", only \"to be the number one on the priority list\". List, so the first of many, not the only one.", "NTA. And this is worrying behaviour from him. That level of possessiveness is not good. Proceed with caution.", "NTA.  He has no place dictating whom you spend time with, especially when it comes to your family.  The whole \u201cher or me\u201d question comes across as emotional blackmail.  If he\u2019s really that threatened by your mother, I would reconsider wanting to be with him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he truly loved you, he would respect and value what is important to you. In this case your mother. Your only 22. Don't need to make life long decisions now. Have a good think. Go spend some time with your mum.", "I'm sorry, but no!!!!  Back away, and back away right now.  This is an older BF who has been trying to separate you from your family and prove over and over that he is the most important to you since you were a teenager.  This is very very unhealthy behavior.  The fact that you feel that you have to decide between loving him and loving your mom is just insane.\n\nYou actually cancelled a trip to see your family this year (this year!!!!) because BF needed you.  Oh, did he now?  I think he mostly needed you to not see your family to prove you love him.\n\nYou are absolutely correct that you're not ready to get married.  And I have a lot of questions in my mind about a considerably older (at this age,5 years is a lot) man trying to separate you from your family.  How does he feel about your other relatives?  Does it bother him when you go out with your friends?  Does he approve of them?  Does he want to know where you are and what you're doing all the time?  \n\nWhat else do you have to do/not do to prove you love him best?\n\nI have alarm bells going off in terms of what the early stages of grooming for domestic abuse look like.  Please be careful.\n\nNTA", "Don't marry a guy like that, he sounds freaky, sorry........", "So I'm just going to leave this here cos I wish someone had told me.

He still doesn\u2019t understand how important your family is to you and is trying to get you to cut off contact. Unless you\u2019re spending his money to fly out all the time, this is not an unreasonable amount of times to visit family. Please consider if you\u2019re really willing to cut off your family for someone who isn\u2019t bothering to appreciate your feelings. You already moved far away to be with him, and yet that\u2019s not good enough?
