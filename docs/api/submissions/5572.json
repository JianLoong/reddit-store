Those are \u2018reported\u2019 numbers.", "YTA. Ever heard of something called karma? One day you'll have a problem and wished you had someone to listen to you. Since it sounds like you're just young and immature, you should learn from this. Friendships in high school are extremely important because sometimes they'll be the friends you'll have for life. Apologize to your friend, or if your have too much pride, lose yourself a friend.", "YTA.  If this person is a friend, act like one.  If he has a problem don't be a jerk about it.  You treated him with outright disrespect and got the rest of his friends on board with it.  He probably feels pretty isolated and disappointed in people that he thought were his friends. He can't trust you and so he's pulling away.  Some people will just need to process an issue a bit longer than you may think is necessary, so you don't have to be mean about it. The golden rule seems to be something some people of your age have never taken to heart: treat others as you would like to be treated.  If you want to have really good friends then treat them better than you did here.  Once you lose the trust of people who called you a friend, it is really hard to get it back.  Do better.", "INFO: Why are you like this?", "Say you're a bully without saying you're a bully AH", "YTA. Yet being nice to people.", "Yta hopefully you grow out of being a dick and look back on this with embarrassment", "Why are you sharing this story here? None of us care. YTA", "YTA", "everyone else liked your comment? i hope your friend finds better friends.", "YTA....It was mean, and not only that but you humiliated him in front of your friend group...\n\nGlad you both kissed and made up though, cos letting it go without talking about it would have created a lot more animosity over time.", "YTA; of course he was justified in not being invested/caring about your life problems; when you don\u2019t care about his. Seriously don\u2019t know what to say, say nothing.", "Having grown up hearing that most days of my childhood (in school) I can tell you for certain that that can cause what nice and compassionate people call \u201cdamage\u201d. I don\u2019t know how you could even ask if you\u2019re TA. You probably should\u2019ve done the smart thing and posted this in TIFU", "YTA \n\nYTA  \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nAlso you're not his friend.", "YTA. don\u2019t be surprised when one day when most of your friends cut you off because of your rudeness", "You\u2019re still a kid so things like this feels like you\u2019re a cool dude, you\u2019re edgy, you simply don\u2019t give a shit. It\u2019s hard to give advice to a kid because you don\u2019t understand yet how much this behavior will affect your adult life. How many people will steer away from you, will ignore you at your workplace and not return your calls once you\u2019re a grownup. \nThey liked your comment because it\u2019s fun to be with the cool guy now. But cool guys like you peak in high school and don\u2019t survive in real life. \nEventually, you will grow up and - hopefully - cringe at this behavior. Now you\u2019re a kid and you\u2019re sharing this thinking how cool and edgy you are. \nObviously, YTA - but you don\u2019t have to be forever. Some day you\u2019ll grow up.", "This makes a lot of sense knowing ur 16 lmao", "YTA. Grow up. What a rude response. It\u2019s so much easier to just say nothing.", "Not at all. I don't care about your issue.", "I don't really care about your post but yea YTA", "YTA. When I was five my parents said\u201cif you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\" I'm quite an introverted person and I went through secondary school, without saying a word unless I was really invested in a lesson. \nI can learn this at five years old, but you can't?\nWhen people in your family have issues do you respond in the same way?", "YTA I wouldn\u2019t want you as a friend", "YTA but since you said you\u2019re 16, you\u2019re still an AH but you\u2019ve got a lot to learn", " nobody care, why post this.", "I don\u2019t give a single fuck about anything about you, how\u2019s that?", "YTA, the RUDE asshole", "YTA what is wrong with you", "Not that any of us care but YTA. And 16 is too old to act like this, you sound like an 8 year old.", "YTA and a bully. I sure hope you grow out of this behavior, because the older your friends get the less they\u2019ll tolerate it.", "YTA. You completely dismissed a problem your friend had. Your friend are also AHs for liking your post.", "We don\u2019t care.", "Ah but then he wouldn't have gotten the negative-attention he so desperately craves.  \n\n\nSome people want to drag those around them down to their level & make them every bit as miserable as they are.  \n\n\nThis is a the prime example of someone being immature, childish, insecure, angry and completely lacking in self-esteem.", "You say you\u2019re 16. Just know that when you\u2019re older, maybe even in just a few years, you\u2019ll look back and cringe at this type of shit you did and regret doing it. Or, you\u2019ll grow into a weird adult bully and won\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t like you. Either way, yta", "What did she steal? If it was something like a very easily replaceable snack and the friend repeatedly complained about the same incident, I could see it being fair of you to say.", "i must be giving people to much credit.. lmao", "Well that's some bullshit. Before my ADHD was diagnosed, my depression and anxiety were way, way worse because I didn't have the tools I needed to be able to function.", "YTA. It seems you have some growing up to do. I had friends like this in highschool and now we don\u2019t quite speak anymore because being close friends with people who don\u2019t care about your actual emotions and life is exhausting.", "YTA. You \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to say\u201d so you decided telling him you didn\u2019t care was the correct response? I see you\u2019re 16, you have a lot of maturing to do. Have the heard the phrase \u201cif you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all\u201d? Give it a try next time.", "Do y'all even like the guy? Because in my friend group whenever someone has a problem we tend to listen to them instead of, you know, throwing an \"I don't care\". YTA all of you", "It would have been better not to respond, than to say in front of everyone that no one cares. That's hurtful no matter what the situation is.", "YTA. And a really shitty friend. You better hope that your friends don\u2019t respond to you in the same manner should you go to them for something.", "He needs better friends. You and all of your friend group need to grow up or grow apart.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t care\u201d YTA \ud83d\ude43", "YTA", "Y'all seem like a shitty friend group. YTA.", "YTA \n\nWhat a shitty thing to say. Especially someone you call a friend. I definitely would not consider you a friend", "YTA. I bet this friend has listened to you complain about something trivial. Additionally, you said a short paragraph, not an annoying amount of multiple texts or any reason for you to be irritated. I mean, it\u2019s true you don\u2019t care, but why are you friends with someone you don\u2019t care about? At 16, you know what being cruel is and what it means. You still chose to be unkind to someone having a difficult time.", "YTA \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say so I just responded we don\u2019t care\u201d\nThat\u2019s so mean, that friend was opening up and trying to seek help and you embarrass him like that. I wouldn\u2019t even consider him a friend if you treat him like that", "Of course YTA, that\u2019s a shitty thing to say to a friend. Try to be better.", "YTA and a bully that gangs up on people. Your a bad friend. I hope you learn your lesson and never speak to someone so disrespectfully again. your words have power and are very hurtful something you shod have learned at 6 not 16", "\"I'm 16\"\n\nYeah, we know. YTA", "The best we can say at this point is, you need to take SEVERAL writing and communication classes.", "YTA you dont even seem to have a reason for being a dick to your \u2018friend\u2019?", "This sounds like a kid, YTA\n\nEdit: oh was a kid lol, still the Asshole", "YTA, I'm suprised he remains friends with you, wouldn't be suprised if in the end he doesn't care about your friendship anymore.", "You're young. That means you also have a tendency to be stupid, but, hopefully you haven't actually done any damage to the kid you were so callous to fir your own amusement. Here's a little news for you, one day, out in the real world, someone will crush you for their own amusement, I hope you have the resilience to make it through that", "Yes YTA. Oh my gosh how could you think anything but that.", "YTA You were mean to someone, they\u2019re mean back. Why are you surprised. Why are you here anyway? Nobody cares about your issue.", "No one cares. Get off Reddit.", "You are pathetic. YTA", "Hope your \"friend\" gets better friends Y T A!", "You\u2019re Nta. You\u2019re just a kid. You don\u2019t get to tell people how to feel. Your opinion will often mean nothing. Grow up kid.", "Yeah, telling them that really was a dick move. YTA", "YTA, wtf", "YTA. you\u2019re exceptionally immature and have a hell of a lot of personal growth to do before you can be considered a decent functional human being. tbh he would\u2019ve need justified in completely unfriending you as why should he care about you or your problems? you don\u2019t care about his. also i would assume you\u2019re doing this in a desperate grasp for attention because any person with a brain knows that that is rude, unkind, and uncalled for.", "Sounds like the whole group sucks if OP said that no one cares and everyone else liked it. Edgelord type behaviour like this was why I hated high school, like it was cool to be as big an AH as possible to people. Hopefully OP\u2019s friend meets some cool people in college and has a nice life away from these losers", "YTA & not a nice person. The fact that you got upset when the same energy you sent to him was returned to you says that a lot. You're supposed to be his friend & this IS something you *should* care about. But you don't because you're self absorbed & if it doesn't happen to or effect you it doesn't matter to you which isn't it. You aren't being a good friend & shouldn't be surprised when you get treated in the same way that you treat others. Be better."]}
