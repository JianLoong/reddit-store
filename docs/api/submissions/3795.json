Your sister is extremely behind the times if she thinks that she is the *only one* who likes and uses this product.\n\nAnd I wanted to add, *it is a tool*. Does your sister cry when someone else has a hammer? Does she cry when she sees another person with a drill? If that seems crazy to you, that's because it is. Your sister is having a tantrum over the equivalent of a *printer*. And your mom is being foolish and rude supporting it.", "Second the cameo option! I gave one as a gift and you cannot believe how many times I\u2019ve been thanked!", "Are you kidding?? Tell everyone.  Send photo's smiling next to it.  When sending cards (especially to her) for ANY occasion, use the cricut and the photos of you happy with it in the making of the cards.", "OP is doing that thing where one tears oneself down before others have a chance to; there's definitely a bigger history behind her family dynamic.\n\nThat said, you're right and I hope OP gets her new hobby and enjoys it.", "Wow. I can\u2019t imagine her giving me advice and being excited for me in getting one. That sounds like such a nice sister relationship. I love her so so much. Even though she is in the wrong I haven\u2019t sent her this post because I know it would hurt her feelings", "They definitely have a favorite. That\u2019s for sure. She is also the one they gave them grandkids and I have dogs. They loved the dogs before the grandkid was born. And now there is always an excuse why they are no longer allowed to come", "You're an evil genius, and I like you!", "Thank. You. This is a much better description of what\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t feel entitled to anything. My mom bought me a cricut and told my sister she got it for me. And then all of this happened as fall out from that. I didn\u2019t even know I was getting it until all of this happened. I also didn\u2019t expect it. My mom asked what I wanted for Christmas and I gave her a list of things that i could use. I don\u2019t buy fun things for myself. I buy life necessities( pay bills, gas food) , things for my dogs to stay Happy and healthy. I don\u2019t buy myself fun stuff like crafting tools. My mom wanted to do something nice for me and the sister made it about herself. And I just wasn\u2019t sure if I was an asshole for wanting a tool my sister already has and uses frequently. We are all really close and lost my brother a few years back. Which made lines blur. Wanting them in my life and letting things like this go Instead of fighting about it. Because I would rather have them in my life than do life without them. I just really want us to all vibe together without all the weird \u201cI have it so you can\u2019t\u201d business.", "NTA - she can't have this as her thing , that isn't how life works", "Crumbs. NTA. Sorry your family has enabled your sister to do this to you for such a long time. Sending photos of yourself crying is next level bananas. On a side note, I would not receive a vacuum in good humour, but that\u2019s just me. Why not fake up some photos of you crying because you thought you were getting a cricut and then your sister made your mum take it away\u2026.", "NTA. so if she has a car you can't ever have one or buy one? what about a house???", "Send those pics and this post to the Cricut company and the might be so sympathetic you get one for free!\nNTA", "NTA\n\nCrafting is for everyone.", "NTA and please don't allow your mom to continue to enable your sister.", "There is something seriously wrong with your family. You do you. NTA", "NTA. Your sister is a ridiculous lady-baby.\n\nI really feel for the one person in your family that's \"allowed\" to like cooking. Must be brutal not being able to share the workload during the holidays.", ">She sent photos of herself sobbing to our mom, saying she was throwing up she was so distraught.\n\nlol completely normal behavior", "I upgraded my cameo 2 to a 4pro and it\u2019s a beast.   I love it.  I really want a laser now though!", "She\u2019s the type to post crying videos on Snapchat to garner attention I just know it", "Oof. Tearing oneself down is to call yourself girly? You\u2019re doing it too. Being a girl isn\u2019t bad. And crafts aren\u2019t just for girls.", "I have one, its easy as cake, I don't own a cricut. And alot of the sewing stores that sell brother machines will offer a basic class on the scan n cut. I've used mine to cut appliques for a quilt, reusable stencils, vinyl, lots of things. I love that I can scan things and perfect place where I want my cut out. Or have it cut out what I scan.", "Not the girly part, but calling it silly is kind of tearing it down I'd say."]}
