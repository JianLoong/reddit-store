I hate it so much. \n\nI have collections and everything was organised, she's moved it all. She even got rid of some of my stuff. I had a really firm mattress and she's replaced it with a memory foam one. I used to have carpets and dark walls and now I have wood floors and every thing is like a really vibrant blue.\n\nI mean, its probably a nice room if youre not me. I just freaking hate it. My bed is uncomfortable, my floor is cold, my walls hurt my eyes and none of my things are where they're supposed to be.\n\nMy mom kinda ushered everyone out when I was freaking out and came back in when I was calmer. She told me my behaviour was unacceptable and that I needed to apologise. \n\nI did and then slept on the couch that night. The morning after my sister tried to act like nothing had happened but I was still really annoyed. She then said \"Aren't you going to say thank you?\"\n\nI told her \"No, I hate it and I hate you for changing it.\"\n\nIt was extreme but I cant explain how awful the room made me feel. My mom was annoyed and yelled a bit so I ended up calling my dad whose now pissed as fuck. He and my mon hate each other so now everyone is just angry and I don't really know what was my fault and what wasn't. \n\nI've been slowly moving my collections to his house and now he's coming so I can move the remaining ones fully.\n\nAnyway, the house has been tense as all hell since.

She clearly just went with what *she* liked, and that\u2019s selfish.\n\nYou apologized to your sister the first time you blew up, and instead of being apologetic herself\u2014she\u2019s only annoyed that you didn\u2019t like it. Even tried sassing you for a thank you. (A thank you for what? Ruining everything you loved about your room, and tossing some of your belongings out?) She hasn\u2019t apologized for doing what she did, so why would you need to apologize again?\n\nAnyone doing home design would know that the client they\u2019re decorating for needs to feel comfortable in their environment, and their tastes are an integral part of decorating.

And, in the end, she decorated your room according to *her* aesthetic without any consideration to what you wanted or what you think looks good. And, if she keeps going on with this attitude, she won\u2019t be working as a designer for long. \n\nAs someone with a bad back, I can especially understand why you are upset with what she did to your bed. You *never* mess with someone\u2019s mattress. \n\nYour mom, being the adult, should have known better than to allow your sister to completely redo your room without talking to you first. \n\nAnd, your sister was not trying to be nice. If she were, she would have sat you down and found out what you wanted first (and if you wanted it in the first place).  What your sister wanted was to show off her decorations skills and have you fawn over how good she is. This was not about doing anything for you: it was all about her.", "NTA.

However, you don\u2019t just go into someone\u2019s personal space, throw things out, and change things without asking. \n\nIt sounds like your sister wants to be a professional decorator. This should be a lesson to her - professional decorators actually *consult* with their clients, and it\u2019s a collaborative relationship. If she were to pull something like this professionally, her business would suffer and she\u2019d be lucky to get just mean words from a client. There would be poor reviews, lost wages, etc.", "NTA. \n\nI completely disagree that she was trying to be nice.

No way this was a \u201csurprise.\u201d She knew you wouldn\u2019t agree so she waited until you were gone to do it without your knowledge. Your sister sounds like she needs to grow up and respect other people\u2019s personal space. \n\nAlso your mother is an AH for siding with her and not acknowledging how negatively this impacted your life. It\u2019s obvious who the golden child is and it\u2019s not you. So sorry OP. Hopefully you can go live with your dad and get some autonomy and respect back.", "NTA Part of being an interior designer is understanding who will be using the space and how best to design it for THEIR needs/desires/esthetics. As someone who went to school for this, your sister should understand how deeply connected we are to our spaces. Unless we are talking about a larger underlying issue (person is a hoarder/deeply depressed/space is falling apart ect) a complete room overall is not something you do as a surprise. Home makeover shows are not reality. Doing this without any input from you is just awful and seriously brings into question your sisters ability to be a designer. She could have the best eye in the world but if she can't work FOR the client none of that matters.", "NTA i can\u2019t imagine being so presumptuous as to redecorate a room for someone who never once expressed an interest in it.", "NTA. Bedrooms are very personal spaces, and her redecorating without your input pretty much erased your identity in the house. Any tension was brought about by your sister and mother.

When I was a teen I was protective over my room as it was a safe space for me. My mom re did it from a picture in a magazine and I hated it. It wasn\u2019t my room anymore it was hers.

Your sister is trying to assert dominance and control in a really weird way.She is also a shitty decorator since decorator's have to take their clients tastes into account more than their own. She threw away things, changed the mattress, etc. Your mom is mad because for this much to be done she had to be in on it. Your sister should put things back as much as possible.\n\nBut regardless you should move to your dad's and let your mom and sister play HG TV to their heart's content.", "NTA. Next time you speak to your sister about it, ask her if she has learned anything about decorating \u201cas it pertains to the customer\u201d.

You need to be able to make your artistic vision work for the client. She failed miserably because she didn\u2019t engage with you at all before she started. This should be a valuable lesson for her if she is serious about it as a career.", "NTA. She had no right to do this without 1) Asking you if you wanted your room redecorated, 2) If you then had said you did, she should've coordinated closely with you to see how she should redecorate it.\n\n That is your personal space, and it took you had it set up and decorated in a way that was perfect for you.\n\nMaybe she thought she was doing something nice for you while practicing her decorating skills, but she sure has a lot to learn about taking other people's perspective into account and working with people. \n\nHang in there.

It was also apparently done without considering your style and taste. Your sister is majorly out of line, and your mom is as well.", "Dear God, definitely NTA. I don't understand all the comments calling you spoiled and ungrateful because 1) not wanting your room to be rearranged without your consent is a basic boundary, not entitlement, and 2) you do not have to be grateful for something you didn't ask for. She literally stole your stuff. No one has to be grateful for being robbed.

Surprises are for those reveal shows, and even in those cases, they usually signed up for it.\n\nIf she really wanted to show off her design skills, she should have designed it around your wants and needs.", "NTA. Sick of people meaning well and actually causing so much stress or damage. My mum and sister \"tidied my flat\" when I went in to have my second baby, and by that they put everything out of place into bin bags. About fucking five of them, which apparently I should've been grateful for when dealing with a newborn and a toddler. \nYour sister needs to learn how to ask if she doesn't know you well enough to know a nice surprise, or face the consequences of her thoughtless actions.", "NTA\u2014she wasn\u2019t being nice. Nice is asking someone if they\u2019d like help and then getting their opinion.", "NTA and your sister is going to be a shit interior designer.

It\u2019s really frustrating because you have one person who does what on the surface would be characterized as a nice gesture. But they do it without thought to the preferences of the recipient, even causing harm or loss to that person in some instances. But because in a neutral, typical situation it would be seen as a nice thing, a favor, a kindness, the recipient is treated like an asshole, like they are ungrateful if they don\u2019t show happiness or get upset at the harm.  If this makes me a curmudgeon then so be it, but I firmly believe good intentions don\u2019t mean shit if you ignored all the signs that your gesture wouldn\u2019t be well received or repeat behavior that you already know has caused trouble in the past.", "NTA Ask your mom, what if you went into your mom's room and painted her walls black without her consent would she thank you?

She's paying for it all so everyone has been super grateful. \n\nWhen I came back from my dads she told me she had a surprise for me. I was pretty nervous - I *hate* surprises. Like, more than your average person.\n\nShe took me upstairs and my room has been redecorated. I had a little bit of a screaming breakdown. I hate it so much. \n\nI have collections and everything was organised, she's moved it all. She even got rid of some of my stuff. I had a really firm mattress and she's replaced it with a memory foam one. I used to have carpets and dark walls and now I have wood floors and every thing is like a really vibrant blue.\n\nI mean, its probably a nice room if youre not me. I just freaking hate it. My bed is uncomfortable, my floor is cold, my walls hurt my eyes and none of my things are where they're supposed to be.\n\nMy mom kinda ushered everyone out when I was freaking out and came back in when I was calmer. She told me my behaviour was unacceptable and that I needed to apologise. \n\nI did and then slept on the couch that night. The morning after my sister tried to act like nothing had happened but I was still really annoyed. She then said \"Aren't you going to say thank you?\"\n\nI told her \"No, I hate it and I hate you for changing it.\"\n\nIt was extreme but I cant explain how awful the room made me feel. My mom was annoyed and yelled a bit so I ended up calling my dad whose now pissed as fuck. He and my mon hate each other so now everyone is just angry and I don't really know what was my fault and what wasn't. \n\nI've been slowly moving my collections to his house and now he's coming so I can move the remaining ones fully.\n\nAnyway, the house has been tense as all hell since.

Also, doing decorating of someone\u2019s space takes a lot of talking about likes, dislikes, etc. She better learn that now or she won\u2019t be successful. Just because she likes something doesn\u2019t mean her clients will. I would have been furious.", "NTA. Who tf just changes someone\u2019s BEDROOM without permission?? And she got rid of your stuff??

I have found that the purple mattresses are the perfect fit for me. Nice firm mattress with a 2\u201d gel pad that conform to me.  Might not work for you but would be worth looking into (the less expensive foam and gel mattresses are firmer than the spring mattresses they make from my experience). I personally feel your sister and mom should cover that cost (how to approach discussed below). Also as someone with adhd I feel you on the color and floor redo. I love hardwood and tile floors but cannot have them in the bedroom. Has always bothered me didn\u2019t understand till recently that it\u2019s likely part of the adhd. Also if the color of the paint is too bright/stimulating it keeps me from sleeping. Apparently even if the lights are off just knowing it\u2019s there is a problem. God I hate adhd\u2026.\n\nI would sit down with your mom and have a conversation with her. Explain to her as calmly as you can that these changes are physically uncomfortable for you. And that the bed is causing you problems with sleeping. I would also have yourself evaluated for Neuro divergent issues. As this may help your mother understand why these changes are a problem. Once she understands then you can both talk to your sister. I would tell her than you understand that her heart was in the right place but that these things are a problem for you, and she should have discussed what you need (not even like or prefer but need) to be comfortable in your space.  Once they understand (if that possible, many \u201cnormal\u201d people just can\u2019t understand because it\u2019s so far outside their experiences) then I would approach having her turn your space back into something that works for you.\n\nETA- I certainly understand the meltdown and being angry.  I also understand people\u2019s reactions to what happened. One thing I\u2019ve learned in the past 40 years is that there is a time and place for anger. However once that initial response is out of the way approaching the problem logically and calmly tends to yield a better outcome in the long run. I\u2019ve also found that when people become angry and combative and try to yell you down. Politely holding your ground and making concise points will usually mess with their heads way more than yelling back. Nice low key way of screwing with them.  Hey I may have my temper under control but I still wanna turn the screws a bit lol.\n\nAlso there was at least one comment about it being ops moms house. I don\u2019t disagree with that on principle. It is her moms house and she was technically the \u201cclient\u201d. However there is something to be said about a child having their own space that represents them (within reason). As someone who shared a bedroom with an older brother for much of my childhood, once we each had our own room I found that in my own space with my things the way I wanted them (unless my brother was being a d!ck and messed with them which was often) I was more productive with my studies and happier overall. Take this with a grain of salt as I have no kids and god willing will never have any. I am also someone who thinks kids need waaayyyy more boundaries than the average kid has today, but this is one thing where I think kids should be given \u201csome\u201d latitude. \n\nETA one more time.
