I hate it so much. \n\nI have collections and everything was organised, she's moved it all. She even got rid of some of my stuff.

I used to have carpets and dark walls and now I have wood floors and every thing is like a really vibrant blue.\n\nI mean, its probably a nice room if youre not me. I just freaking hate it. My bed is uncomfortable, my floor is cold, my walls hurt my eyes and none of my things are where they're supposed to be.\n\nMy mom kinda ushered everyone out when I was freaking out and came back in when I was calmer. She told me my behaviour was unacceptable and that I needed to apologise. \n\nI did and then slept on the couch that night. The morning after my sister tried to act like nothing had happened but I was still really annoyed. She then said \"Aren't you going to say thank you?\"\n\nI told her \"No, I hate it and I hate you for changing it.\"\n\nIt was extreme but I cant explain how awful the room made me feel. My mom was annoyed and yelled a bit so I ended up calling my dad whose now pissed as fuck. He and my mon hate each other so now everyone is just angry and I don't really know what was my fault and what wasn't. \n\nI've been slowly moving my collections to his house and now he's coming so I can move the remaining ones fully.\n\nAnyway, the house has been tense as all hell since.

She clearly just went with what *she* liked, and that\u2019s selfish.\n\nYou apologized to your sister the first time you blew up, and instead of being apologetic herself\u2014she\u2019s only annoyed that you didn\u2019t like it. Even tried sassing you for a thank you. (A thank you for what? Ruining everything you loved about your room, and tossing some of your belongings out?) She hasn\u2019t apologized for doing what she did, so why would you need to apologize again?\n\nAnyone doing home design would know that the client they\u2019re decorating for needs to feel comfortable in their environment, and their tastes are an integral part of decorating.

And, in the end, she decorated your room according to *her* aesthetic without any consideration to what you wanted or what you think looks good. And, if she keeps going on with this attitude, she won\u2019t be working as a designer for long. \n\nAs someone with a bad back, I can especially understand why you are upset with what she did to your bed. You *never* mess with someone\u2019s mattress. \n\nYour mom, being the adult, should have known better than to allow your sister to completely redo your room without talking to you first. \n\nAnd, your sister was not trying to be nice. If she were, she would have sat you down and found out what you wanted first (and if you wanted it in the first place).  What your sister wanted was to show off her decorations skills and have you fawn over how good she is. This was not about doing anything for you: it was all about her.", "NTA.

However, you don\u2019t just go into someone\u2019s personal space, throw things out, and change things without asking. \n\nIt sounds like your sister wants to be a professional decorator. This should be a lesson to her - professional decorators actually *consult* with their clients, and it\u2019s a collaborative relationship. If she were to pull something like this professionally, her business would suffer and she\u2019d be lucky to get just mean words from a client. There would be poor reviews, lost wages, etc.", "NTA. \n\nI completely disagree that she was trying to be nice.

No way this was a \u201csurprise.\u201d She knew you wouldn\u2019t agree so she waited until you were gone to do it without your knowledge. Your sister sounds like she needs to grow up and respect other people\u2019s personal space. \n\nAlso your mother is an AH for siding with her and not acknowledging how negatively this impacted your life. It\u2019s obvious who the golden child is and it\u2019s not you. So sorry OP. Hopefully you can go live with your dad and get some autonomy and respect back.", "NTA Part of being an interior designer is understanding who will be using the space and how best to design it for THEIR needs/desires/esthetics. As someone who went to school for this, your sister should understand how deeply connected we are to our spaces. Unless we are talking about a larger underlying issue (person is a hoarder/deeply depressed/space is falling apart ect) a complete room overall is not something you do as a surprise. Home makeover shows are not reality. Doing this without any input from you is just awful and seriously brings into question your sisters ability to be a designer. She could have the best eye in the world but if she can't work FOR the client none of that matters.", "NTA i can\u2019t imagine being so presumptuous as to redecorate a room for someone who never once expressed an interest in it.", "NTA. Bedrooms are very personal spaces, and her redecorating without your input pretty much erased your identity in the house. Any tension was brought about by your sister and mother.

When I was a teen I was protective over my room as it was a safe space for me. My mom re did it from a picture in a magazine and I hated it. It wasn\u2019t my room anymore it was hers.

Your sister is trying to assert dominance and control in a really weird way.She is also a shitty decorator since decorator's have to take their clients tastes into account more than their own. She threw away things, changed the mattress, etc. Your mom is mad because for this much to be done she had to be in on it. Your sister should put things back as much as possible.\n\nBut regardless you should move to your dad's and let your mom and sister play HG TV to their heart's content.", "NTA. Next time you speak to your sister about it, ask her if she has learned anything about decorating \u201cas it pertains to the customer\u201d. A person that loves decorating but is indifferent to the needs, wants or desires of the person that they are decorating for is NOT going to make it in the industry. You need to be able to make your artistic vision work for the client. She failed miserably because she didn\u2019t engage with you at all before she started. This should be a valuable lesson for her if she is serious about it as a career.", "NTA. She had no right to do this without 1) Asking you if you wanted your room redecorated, 2) If you then had said you did, she should've coordinated closely with you to see how she should redecorate it.\n\n That is your personal space, and it took you had it set up and decorated in a way that was perfect for you.\n\nMaybe she thought she was doing something nice for you while practicing her decorating skills, but she sure has a lot to learn about taking other people's perspective into account and working with people. \n\nHang in there.

So I think in the end it will be a safer space.", "NTA\n\nThis was a violation of your space and privacy, done without your consent or knowledge. It was also apparently done without considering your style and taste. Your sister is majorly out of line, and your mom is as well.", "Dear God, definitely NTA. I don't understand all the comments calling you spoiled and ungrateful because 1) not wanting your room to be rearranged without your consent is a basic boundary, not entitlement, and 2) you do not have to be grateful for something you didn't ask for. She literally stole your stuff. No one has to be grateful for being robbed.

Surprises are for those reveal shows, and even in those cases, they usually signed up for it.\n\nIf she really wanted to show off her design skills, she should have designed it around your wants and needs.", "NTA. Sick of people meaning well and actually causing so much stress or damage. My mum and sister \"tidied my flat\" when I went in to have my second baby, and by that they put everything out of place into bin bags. About fucking five of them, which apparently I should've been grateful for when dealing with a newborn and a toddler. \nYour sister needs to learn how to ask if she doesn't know you well enough to know a nice surprise, or face the consequences of her thoughtless actions.", "NTA\u2014she wasn\u2019t being nice. Nice is asking someone if they\u2019d like help and then getting their opinion.", "NTA and your sister is going to be a shit interior designer. Interior decorators/designers are supposed to help clients decorate to the *client\u2019s* overall taste and help guide them through the process of what the client likes. They are not supposed to impose their own taste on the client.", "That sounds like a massive violation of your space and privacy. Not cool.\n\nNTA.", "NTA situations like this really bug me. It\u2019s really frustrating because you have one person who does what on the surface would be characterized as a nice gesture. But they do it without thought to the preferences of the recipient, even causing harm or loss to that person in some instances. But because in a neutral, typical situation it would be seen as a nice thing, a favor, a kindness, the recipient is treated like an asshole, like they are ungrateful if they don\u2019t show happiness or get upset at the harm.  If this makes me a curmudgeon then so be it, but I firmly believe good intentions don\u2019t mean shit if you ignored all the signs that your gesture wouldn\u2019t be well received or repeat behavior that you already know has caused trouble in the past.", "NTA Ask your mom, what if you went into your mom's room and painted her walls black without her consent would she thank you?

Like, more than your average person.\n\nShe took me upstairs and my room has been redecorated. I had a little bit of a screaming breakdown. I hate it so much. \n\nI have collections and everything was organised, she's moved it all. She even got rid of some of my stuff. I had a really firm mattress and she's replaced it with a memory foam one. I used to have carpets and dark walls and now I have wood floors and every thing is like a really vibrant blue.\n\nI mean, its probably a nice room if youre not me. I just freaking hate it. My bed is uncomfortable, my floor is cold, my walls hurt my eyes and none of my things are where they're supposed to be.\n\nMy mom kinda ushered everyone out when I was freaking out and came back in when I was calmer. She told me my behaviour was unacceptable and that I needed to apologise. \n\nI did and then slept on the couch that night. The morning after my sister tried to act like nothing had happened but I was still really annoyed. She then said \"Aren't you going to say thank you?\"\n\nI told her \"No, I hate it and I hate you for changing it.\"\n\nIt was extreme but I cant explain how awful the room made me feel. My mom was annoyed and yelled a bit so I ended up calling my dad whose now pissed as fuck. He and my mon hate each other so now everyone is just angry and I don't really know what was my fault and what wasn't. \n\nI've been slowly moving my collections to his house and now he's coming so I can move the remaining ones fully.\n\nAnyway, the house has been tense as all hell since.

I would be absolutely shocked and infuriated if I walked into my room like that. It\u2019s common sense that you don\u2019t go into someone\u2019s space and change it and throw away their things without their consent. You are delusional", "Its not voluntary. But I'm definitely trying t figure it out.", "She wouldn't have to do any of that unnecessary shit if her sister had just been respectful and asked for permission first. She didn't even ask what OP's tastes are, which is what a real interior designer would do for their client.", "Because its my old mattress - my dad spent three years looking for one I could sleep on. My mattress was like freaking rare. I'd need new everything again. My new bed frame is like velvet and it makes me want to vomit. The walls all need repainting and the floor needs recarpeting. I also can't get the things back she trashed. \n\nYou can't just return all this stuff. My sister said she spent like 3k or something. She isn't just gonna trash it and rebuy it all new.", "I just have to ask based on your responses... do you think it's okay that the sister *threw away op's stuff*? It's one thing to redecorate a space without permission whether or not you're trying to be nice, but trying to be nice or no, what gives anyone the right to decide if something *that's not theirs* is okay to throw away? Also it doesn't really sound like sister was being nice if she didn't even try to design the room in a way that OP would like. It sounds like she wasn't actually thinking of OP at all and just wanted another space to decorate, and it sounds like you are saying eff OP and their feelings as long as sister \"got to do something nice\".\n\nI think if the sister had simply rearranged some furniture or bought new bedding and curtains or something to that effect and not actually gotten rid of OPs stuff and tried to change their aesthetic, this would be a minor thing and your \"YTA\" designation might be more warranted, but this girl completely redid the room according to her own tastes and then gave herself permission to throw away belongings that weren't hers to throw away. How is that okay in the slightest??? Why shouldn't OP be mad?", "That\u2019s a lot of work considering the sister could have not acted like a moron and left the room alone.", "yeah that\u2019s what makes her an ah.", "I\u2019m sorry - it sucks when family is shitty. Don\u2019t apologize. Tell her you are sorry she doesn\u2019t know you well enough to realize that this isn\u2019t something you\u2019d have wanted.", "I obviously can\u2019t diagnose anything, but I\u2019d recommend another assessment once things have died down. Your reaction and the specific things you\u2019re upset about (colors hurting, unable to sleep on a soft mattress, ect) are very relatable to me as an autistic person but may be difficult for a neurotypical person to understand. More low-needs autism can be overlooked at younger ages, especially in women. Either way your reaction is justified.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Keyword: suprise. That's a direct indicator that she wanted to suprise him. You don't ask people if you can make a suprise to them and it's not the same relationship with a designer and it's client. Also complainin and being a drama queen won't change anything.", "Yeah my dad wants to get me assessed again. I don't know when he's doing it though. Thanks :)", "You're not obligated to thank them in that scenario either, but that is egregiously different from rearranging someone's room. You're comparing apples to oranges.", "Lol that\u2019s fucking ridiculous comparison. Destroying someone\u2019s space and things is not comparable to holding a door open for someone", "That's....not comparable at all. Someone holding a door open for you doesn't \"cost\" you anything, except the opportunity to open the door yourself. In this situation, OP's room was drastically changed, and it would be costly to change it back. Her bed was changed and is no longer comfortable for her to sleep on, her floor was changed, everything was rearranged and had some stuff of hers thrown out. You cannot in all honesty tell me that you would be grateful if someone waltzed into your living space, threw some of your stuff out, rearranged everything, and made your bed uncomfortable to sleep on. \n\nA more apt analogy would be if I went to get food and brought back liver for you, and got mad at you when it turns out you hate liver. But you should be grateful I got you liver in the first place!", "I think we found the sister or mother.", "Your an AH for lecturing and shaming a girl who reacted normally to someone destroying her room and trashing her things. If you don\u2019t want feedback don\u2019t comment on Reddit.", "Changing something important like someone's personal space should ALWAYS be discussed.", "Not everyone wants a surprise redesign of their personal space. Sounds like either you just let everyone walk all over you. Or you walk all over people and want everyone to accept it. YTA.", "Keywords: respect and common sense. You can use both and see if a person will like the surprise or not.", "[removed]", "That just shows you weren't doing the favor out of the kindness of your heart, you were doing it with the expectation of receiving something in return. That's not doing a favor or showing courtesy."]}
