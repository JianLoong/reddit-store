It's hard to tell not knowing the tone of the conversation. You said he seemed annoyed but the comment was snarky.", "Mild ESH. What you do is really none of his business and he certainly doesn\u2019t get to say who you hang out with and when. You didn\u2019t handle it as well as you could have. No one did anything horrible. Talk it out if he\u2019s willing.", "Hmm. Is this about you attending a girls night or choosing to hang with other friends? And is your girls night with the 4 women in your established friend group or a different group of friends?", "INFO: this really reads like he was possibly just trying to include you in the guys\u2019 night rather than being mad about you joining girls\u2019 night. Did he actually say anything indicating he was upset about you going to girls night? Or did he merely invite you to guys night? I guess the info I\u2019m asking for is a vibe check. Is it possible you were overreacting based on your own prior experiences and he was really just trying to be nice and hang out with you?", "YTA though a pretty mild one. Probably just needs a brief, mature, confidential apology the the lines of \"sorry was a bit catty before just am not going to be interested in the activities on a guys night, more what the girls do etc\".\n\nUnless it is because he's homophobic, then he's obvs TA", "YTA. You also seem to know you didn\u2019t exactly handle this well. It seems he was asking a simple question and you kinda came at him.", "YTA. You sound rude and egotistical for saying things like that.", "YTA gay as fuck doesn't give you the right to behave like that", "EDIT: NTA\n\nINFO: Was he rude on how he talked to you, and does he know you're gay? \n\nIf he was rude, then you're okay, but if it was a question out of confusion and not out of malice, then yeah, it sounds like you may owe the guy an apology.", "NTA on your choice to stick to girls night. \n\nBut the shade on a new friend? Not ok. Apologize.", "ESH to my opinion. You shouldn't have been responding, his girlfriend needed to handle it, and moreover the conflict shouldn't have even existed but the guy is clearly insecure about it.\n\nYour comment is likely deserving of an apology and I would be wary of it affecting your relationship with his girlfriend if you don't square it up with both of them soon.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA. His question could be read as homophobic, but since he's new to the group it's likely just that and since you say he doesn't seem like a bad guy. But your answer was definitely taunting. Try to be more welcoming, and he might surprise you. A good apology goes a long way.", "NTA \n\nI mean you\u2019ve always attended girls nights! Your activities are more aligned with what the girls nights do!\n\nWhy is a new guy wanting to hop in and change the dynamic of a group of people that has worked for X amount of time? \n\nI mean to me boys night would suck! I don\u2019t want to listen to them talk about cars and how women are so \u2026.", "NTA, he sounds insecure", "I mean.. i get him..but at least he tried to include you in with the boys instead of just denying you the girls night. I guess AH-ish, but nothing dramatic. Just talk to the guy and try to let him know that he doesn't need to feel insecure etc etc.. I bet he'll come around, but by inclusive of his feelings, not by just being \"mean\"", "NTA. He doesn't get to show up in your friend group and dictate who can go to what social events just because one of the girls is dating him. In my experience, straight dudes get huffy about gay guys at girls nights usually because they feel threatened when their girls hang out with any guys without them or because they're insecure about just not being invited to something their girl is going to. I don't think \"suck it up buttercup\" is even that harsh. You shouldn't have to justify your relationship to your friends in the first place. Maybe you could have been nicer, but there's always next time. What he did was rude, and so you responded dismissively. You don't have to stand there and take it.", "NTA slay queen as u should\ud83d\ude3c", "INFO\n\nDid he know you are gay?", "YTA.  Unless this guy was being rude to you first (your other comments say this wasn\u2019t really so), there was no need to be this flippant with a new person.  \n\nLike, would you say that to a coworker you didn\u2019t know very well? Probably not.\n\nYou should apologize.", "Info: does he not like that you're hanging out with them or does he legitimately want you to join guys night?", "YTA. I feel like dismissing his was bad. I feel like his girlfriend will smooth things over but I would try and be cool with him next time or throw less shade. \n\nHes new to the group and its hard for guys to have thier girl hangout with other guys even if they are gay as shit. I know it doesn't make sense but its true. My wife has a gbf and there is an adjustment period. And my best man at my wedding and good friend growing up is gay so its not like I was new to having gay friends. \n\nAs hes around more and he gets to know you and the group more im sure yall won't even remember it but just be cool until you can start saying shit like that and it will come off funny any not mean anything by it", "NTA\n\nThe straights are fine, he really can suck it up buttercup", "YTA gay as fuck doesn't mean anything now days.

Because of this ive always been \"one of the girls\" in my friend circle so i always get invited to girls nights. We usually try to have one at least once every fortnight.\n\nOne of my friends has a new boyfriend that joined our friend group (friend group consisting of me, 4 women and 3 guys, now 4 after he joined).

It sounds like he didn't just casually suggest you were welcome at guy's night, but that he was weirded out by your presence there. I also think it's weird that when you replied with your comment about nails and magic mike, he didn't immediately get the picture and instead tried to, what, defend his masculinity by insisting that of course guys don't watch magic mike? \n\nThat said, I think your comment of \"suck it up\" was uncalled for in this situation. You could have simply thanked him for the invite but told him you prefer the girls' activities. If he had continued pressing the situation, then maybe it would be time to escalate. He could have been genuinely trying to be nice in a clumsy, awkward way.", "YTA only because you have such a huge chip on your shoulder and seem to get off on telling other people off.  Why are you so defensive and snotty?\n\nHe was curious and I can't blame him for that.  He's new in the group and is only just learning the dynamics.  \n\nYou were rude for no reason other than you think you have the right to put him in his place, just 'cause.  Not a good look for anyone, including amazing you.", "YTA. You seem to be trying to live up to the snarky stereotype some people have of gay men. Someone thought to be polite and invite you, and you just sent rudeness his way", "Look, NAH. But...if any people who are attracted to men are invited is it \"girls night\"? Maybe the dude is bi, but uncomfortable outing himself or still not comfy with himself.\n\nTbh, my friends and I all started feeling uncomfy with \"girls\" and \"boys\" night. Its needlessly gendered when you can say its a friends night out. Partners dont need to go to everything, or share all the same friends.\n\nIf you actually think this guy is decent maybe reach out, with a more serious tone, and ask what it is that hes uncomfortable with. Sure, maybe hes just feeling weird about a man being at \"girls night\" even if youre gay. But maybe it is deeper and you get to know each other better.", "I mean yeah. Straight guy throwing his weight around at a gay man - snark will happen. The only one whose opinion matters on op's attendance of girls night is the girls.", "Oh yeah i definitely own up to me being snarky and a bit catty about it. It was definitely rude and the wrong way to communicate that guys night just arent for me.", "Girls night is with these 4 women.", "Its definitely a possibility that i reacted based on past experience. I dont think i know him well enough yet to go off vibes but i should probably give him a chance rather than assuming his insecure", "Not sure if he is homophobic but i dont want to assume he is so i give the benefit of the doubt", "Wasnt trying to be rude or anything but more point out that the things i enjoy doing arent something a bunch of straight men want to do on a guys night. Bit i understand i probably did come off rude as fuck and did probably judge him in the moment unfairly.", "He seemed annoyed that I attend and yeah he knows im gay. But im not sure if he is annoyed at me attending because im a guy or some other reason like wanting me to attend guys night to get to know me or something. I dont want to assume the worst but sometimes thats hard in the moment.", "Yeah ive tried guys night in the past and it was terrible for me. I just kind of quietly sat around not being able to join the conversations because they were about women or something im just not interested in like \"did you catch the sports ball last night\", all while sitting around drinking beer (hate beer, it taste yuck).", "Or maybe he wanted OP to hang out.", "Yeah i think i unfairly judged him in the moment because it seemed so insecure and we have had problems in the past with an ex bf nearly getting violent with me because he didn't like that another guy was hanging out with \"his girl\". That's why i feel bad because it did seem like he wanted to just invite me along but i just jumped to conclusions based on my own bias.", "Yeah i really should of been nicer about it. I let past experiences cloud my judgement and that's not fair to him when i dont even know if this is insecurity or something else", "Oh I slay all day honey, no doubt about that \ud83d\udc85", "Yeah he knows", "Im not to sure about it.

You're still a guy with someone else's girl\n\nWhat the fuck does this even mean?", "Meh, gay guy, disagree, think you handled it well.

I could be wrong since I didn't hear his tone of voice.", "If he knows you are gay and still said that, then you\u2019re NTA.", "New guy can\u2019t come in and arbitrarily say \u201call the penis\u2019 go here\u201d and \u201call the vaginas go here\u201d. \n\nYou are a girls night sort of guy! You have been going to girls night with these girls for years! So\u2026. \n\nIs he worried you are going to have a pillow fight with his girlfriend?\n\nDon\u2019t answer that? He\u2019s just being weird! \n\nI have a friend who always ends up on a girls night. He isn\u2019t gay. He just fits in with the girls. Maybe because he has 4 sisters. No one cares", "Yeah and in the process probably came off as really defensive, rude, and straight up mean. I'd apologize and explain to him that it wasn't about him and you appreciate his efforts and maybe explain what you said in your comment though it is NOT an excuse.", "But did he know before asking you that?\n\nAnyways I don't think you needed to go straight to being rude and defensive.\n\nAlso are you sure he was uncomfortable? Maybe it was just an innocent question.", "This one is too hard to judge for me. \n\nYes, you both seem like maybe you got a big defensive or snarky, but that's to be expected in the scenario I think. \n\nAre you both open enough to discuss the real issue, whatever it is?", "Okay fair\n\nThe straights are *not* okay, but also this straight will be fine. Both are true!", "It means often times that people think k they can do things just because there gay.  As a woman I've been to a bar and just get kissed by random girls all the time because there women and think they can get away with it.", "Yeah ive already basically explained that to her already. She understands totally and was a bit pisses he suggested i dont go to girls night too but i still think it would be good for me to say that to him soon if he truly just wants to hang out or something.", "Yeah, it\u2019s probably worth talking to your friend/his gf about and just be real and say, \u201chey when this happened, I reacted like this because I thought he was irritated about be hanging out for girls night and I got defensive. But after thinking about it, maybe he was just asking to hang out and get to know me. Maybe I misread that and I feel bad. What do you think?\u201d\n\nGood luck OP. I am going NAH for the judgment. I think it was possibly miscommunication. Hope you can get clarity and build a friendship with the new guy.", "Ohhhhh. That\u2019s novel", "Yeah he knew well before and probably knew before i or anyone even told him.", "Im open. Im not sure if he is, i don't know him to well but i should give it a chance.", "r/AreTheStraightsOK", "How exactly is going to girls night (with the girls\u2019 agreement) comparable to non-consensual sexual contact? What the fuck?", "Then it was probably just an innocent question with no ill intentions. Maybe he just wanted to have you in \"guys night\" to get to know you better. People usually try to have a good relation with their partners' friends. Honestly I can see myself as this guy blundering a social situation by trying to be friendly but backfiring completely.", "The straights downvoting us are definitely not okay", "YTA.", "NTA. As a woman who's friends with a lot of gay men, this is a reoccurring thing with straight men. They get jealous because they don't get included in something they absolutely wouldn't want to be included in. I've heard all sorts of nonsense from \"is he ACTUALLY gay though, or just trying to sneak into your sleepovers?\" to \"you're doing this to make me jealous\" blah blah blah. It's all insecurity that's ultimately rooted in homophobia. \n\nIt's not like you said anything personal to him, he was being rude in the first place by questioning your ongoing dynamic as an established friends group. And come on...\"suck it up buttercup\" is very, very mild. If he's offended then he probably needed to hear it. Speak to him if you're concerned about keeping peace within the group. My money says he's a control freak and he won't last, but at least you will have kept your side of the street clean.", "I think personally the comment wasn't needed and couldn't been worded better.\nEither way tho I don't see you as the AH btw.", "NTA, the comment was snarky so you could have done better there.", "YTA\nYou were deliberately rude. It's absolutely your right to attend girls night if invited but you don't need to be an AH about it. You didn't stoop to his level, you went to the third basement", "NAH. He\u2019s new to the group and a lot of straight guys aren\u2019t used to their girlfriends gay friends going to girls night. Apparently it\u2019s a bi-wife energy thing to be okay with. \nAnd maybe the boyfriend hasn\u2019t had any prior experiences with men liking girls nights activities, I know plenty of gay men who don\u2019t.", "I'd go NTA as you've been one of the girls longer than he's been with his gf, so it's not something he would get a say on and comes across insecure", "NAH. At least not yet. I might apologize if the time is right, give a friendly gesture or attempt to create a brief moment where you show acceptance of him. He is likely insecure because along with new friendships, his relationship is probably new as well. \n\nDismissing his feelings sucks, and is rude, but it's not what I qualify as AH behavior. If you deliberately excluded him from anything that isn't \"girls only\" maybe.", "You probably should have pointed out that while they were watching a game on tv you would be lusting after the players, lol", "***WHAT***"]}
