Over the text, she had messaged me saying she couldn't stay with me and wanted a divorce. When I called her, she did not pick up the calls. After trying for a few hours, she finally picked up and said that I was wasting her time. I asked her genuinely if she really did not want to stay with me or if she was just troubled with something and said it in frustration. She did not answer me, but I said that if she did not mean that, then she should not say this thing as it hurt me. BTW, she has been saying that she will divorce me in a few months for quite some time now. \n\nThe very next day, we were talking fine, and while texting (because she was travelling with her family), she said,   \n\"So you wanted to divorce me?\" I replied, \"No, you wanted\". Then she texted saying \"No\", and here I made the mistake of sending her the screenshot of her message from the previous day. This triggered something in her, and she blamed me for keeping proof. (I had a few screenshots from the past where she had said some horrible things, and then later, she flipped out, saying she never said those things, and she lied to her parents and friends, who blamed me for these things.)  \nAnyway, for the next two days, we did not talk at all. Last night, after reaching here, she stopped sharing her location with me and then exited the family group. She has done it in the past as well and I had requested her not to do it.  \nToday was my BIL's registered wedding, followed by a tiny dinner (just the family). But I did not call my wife or my BIL or get any calls/messages from them inviting me to the wedding or the dinner. Just a few days back, my wife had told me that my MIL was telling her to ask me to the wedding/dinner.   \n\n\nAm I acting like an a\\*\\*hole here? Should I have called her/BIL/MIL to ask about the dinner's time and venue? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Leave her, keep every documentation you have of her behaviour, and start the divorce proceedings. Why waste your time with her mind games and her poor attempts at gaslighting you? NTA, but you are one to yourself. Have some self-respect for once. You deserve better.", "Talk to her mother quietly, mention that you think something is going on with your wife and to keep an eye on her. \nThen quietly plan your exit, get your financials in oder and go see a lawyer", "You are familiar with how cats play with mice?\n\nInfo : you are the mouse in your wife's mental game. She's a narcistic powerplayer.\n\nAsk yourself, is that really the kind of partnership you want in a marriage?\n\nIf not, contact a divorce lawyer and the next time she contacts you, just pass along that information.\n\nNTA for not showing up at a wedding you were not invited to, and where you obviously were not wanted.", "NTA\n\n  \nStop playing her games, tale the divorce option.", "NTA.  Her behavior is bizarre.  I'd take her up on the offer of divorce.", "Your marriage is either over or needs to be. This behaviour is childish.\n\nNTA", "ESH, exhausting to read.\n\nGET A DIVORCE.\n\nAlso, I get controlling vibes from you. But your wife is a real piece of work.", "Yes.

But what triggered me was her exiting the family group of Apple cloud, when long, long back she had blamed me that I considered one of my friends and her wife to be my family just because I was added to his family group (which I was only part of because we used to be room-mates before my wedding and it was easy and cheap for us to be in a family).", ">You are a fool for sticking with her\n\n\nIsn't this harsh for a man trying to work on his marriage?

It's possible she's playing games with you (in which case I'd say \"run\"), it's also possible she really does forget what she's been telling you from one day to the next, and gets understandably upset because she thinks you're accusing her of things she didn't do. Has she always been like this? Are your interactions normal aside from the \"I want to divorce you/no I don't\" thing? Do you know if she behaves weirdly to other people as well? Are there times when you can have a reasonable conversation about this issue?  \nIn any case, maybe you should start by talking to a doctor or therapist yourself to get advice on how to deal with this situation. This might be a sign of something serious, like schizophrenia, brain cancer, diabetes, the first signs of dementia...", "Bro.... you need help"]}
