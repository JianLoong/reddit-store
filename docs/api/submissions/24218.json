Seek legal counsel.  If your sister feels unsafe in your parents' home because of her orientation, CPS may recommend she stay with you.  (Depends on where you live, though.)", "NTA, but get legal advice asap. Laws vary, but she is a minor and I imagine things will be a lot worse if she's forced back home. Document anything you can to support your case and stay safe.", "NTA you\u2019re protecting your sister. How did he get a picture of her in your apartment?", "Jesus Christ, NTA. Thank you for protecting her.", "NTA. You're a good brother. \n\nI don't know what the laws are regarding teenagers. She's still technically a minor, but I'd think she's old enough to have a say in where she lives. As long as she's still attending school. Perhaps look into what the process would be to file paperwork to be her legal guardian.", "NTA. So your father has a tracker on your sister. Perhaps on her phone. They may try to grab her if she leaves the apartment. If your sister was physically abuse, she should make a police report to keep them away from her.", "NTA  Your sister is in danger. Please keep her safe.  Check all resources for LGBTQ support. Through these resources, find an attorney that has experience and sensitivity to your sister's issues.\n\n Your sister is lucky to have you. Good luck.", "NTA - in spirit and you are a great big brother.  Unfortunately, because she is a minor and you denied your parents access to her, they can hit you with kidnapping.  It sucks, but that's how it works.  It is a whole different ball game since she's a minor and you need to walk carefully down this path.", "NTA oh I can understand you wanting to protect your sister so here\u2019s how I would do it. I will tell them if they interfere anymore in your younger sisters life that you will spread what is happening into the community I mean tell everyone they will probably want to hide the situation so I think this might work out so that your sister can stay with you", "NTA. Your sister's safety and well-being are your top priorities, and it's clear that you're doing everything you can to protect her from a harmful environment. Growing up in a household with such toxic beliefs about gender roles, race, and sexuality has likely shaped your strong commitment to ensuring she's safe and accepted.\n\nWhen Mandy turned to you for help after facing a hostile reaction from your parents due to her sexual orientation and relationship, you acted as a supportive and caring older sibling. While lying about her location might feel uncomfortable, it's clear that your intention is to shield her from further harm.\n\nYour mother's perspective doesn't seem to acknowledge the real danger Mandy is facing. Your actions are rooted in a deep concern for her well-being, and it's evident that your love for her drives your decisions. Threats of arrest from your parents may not carry much weight if the authorities understand the situation's complexity and the necessity of protecting Mandy.\n\nIn the end, you're acting in Mandy's best interest and doing what you believe is right to provide her with a safe space away from a toxic environment. From a compassionate standpoint, you're definitely not the asshole in this situation.", "NTA.  Keep her safe and call CPS to find out what your options are and to document everything.\n\nAre there any sympathetic family members who could take her in?  \n\nAre you prepared to take her in if you have to?\n\nIt's a lot.  Good luck.", "Good bro. Mandy is lucky to have a family member she can be safe with while this plays out with your parents. Defo NTA. Also even if the police do show up you can\u2019t be arrested for kidnap, she is your sister and she has willingly come to your place.

If you're an 18yo in your first apartment, you're not equipped to raise and house your 15yo sister?", "NTA. And check Mandy's phone and turn off the locate feature.

It sucks, but that's how it works. \n\nJfc\u2026Nope, that\u2019s not how it works. First of all, there\u2019s a lot of leeway in the fact that she\u2019s 15, not 5.

Like, LITERALLY RIGHT FUCKING NOW.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely a path your sister can take to remove herself from her family situation, but you definitely need a lawyer to help her navigate that quagmire. Call a lawyer yesterday", "Hopping on the top comment to say: OP people keep telling you just hire a lawyer like an 18 years old has the wherewithall to do that.\n\nWhat you can do is contact local women's shelters and/or LGBTQ+ support organizations, who may be able to direct you to free/inexpensive legal aid.\n\nDo this BEFORE you contact CPS. Many places, CPS will talk to the parents, determine that the house is clean and has food, not have any evidence of clear physical abuse, and send the runaway (that's what your sister is considered to be) right back home.", "I second this 100%, I don\u2019t know where you live but where I am from, if CPS are brought in, then the child is taken to the closest relative of the child,", "You don't need to wait on that.
