My sister and I used to sleep at his place every other weekend. I always loved my dad a lot and enjoyed spending time with him, but when I turned 12, I started wanting to hangout with friends instead, since I was bored at his place. So I decided not to go to his place every other weekend anymore and from what I remember, my mom and dad discussed that he will instead pick us up sometimes for dinner or a trip. I don\u2018t remember what happened then, but ever since I have not seen my dad. He texts me to ask me how I am like once a month but he never initiates meeting me. I think that he never tried to stay in contact and to hangout with me when I was 12, he always said he does not want to pressure me and that it is normal to not want to hangout with parents at this age. The next few years I felt very rejected by him because I felt like it was his responsibility to make plans to see me.

A 12-year-old child cannot be blamed for distancing the relationship with their parent. Though I respect your father not wanting to pressure you in a relationship you possibly didn't want, I do think he could've made more effort to see you. At least he kept in touch.\nAnyway, there's no use feeling guilty now, so look for your father and try to do something together. Make up for the lost time and talk to each other. I suppose he will be happy to do so", "NAH. you were a kid and your priorities are friends and fun, and he probably knew forcing a relationship would backfire. It just went on too long it started to breed resentment. If he's still texting you that means he's open to rekindling your relationship. Arrange to meet him, explain all of these things and how you felt, and give him a chance to explain his side of it. You might feel differently afterwards.", "NAH. You're DEFINITELY NTA. You were a child and at this age you are not responsible for having a relationship with your parents. Your dad does not sound like an asshole either, as the comment beneath me said, he probably did not want to force a relationship and after a few years it just got uncomfortable for both and both felt rejected. \n\nTry to build a relationship with him now, I'm sure it's worth it.", "NTA you were a kid, come on. Don't beat yourself up. You're an adult now, and you can choose properly. Trying to reconnect now is a good idea, it's not too late (in fact do it while he's around!). You may learn a thing or two.\n\nThen, if this whole this is your dad's fault or something, you will find out sitting down with him and having adult conversations. Sometimes things aren't black or white, there's a lot to unpack after 10 years, why not start now?\n\nGood luck!", "NAH.  It is natural to want to do things with your friends.  It's understandable that your dad didn't want to make you a hostage every weekend. The good thing is that now you realize you want that relationship and it seems like your dad does too.  So go make the most of the time you have together because life is too short for bitterness and regret.", "NTA - sorry you feel guilty about this. But regardless of what you may or may not have done, always remember that you were the child in this relationship and he was the adult.", "It's a two way street for sure\n\nBut I'm gonna say NTA because you were so young BUT go easy on your dad and try and fix things now while you have time \n\nHe may not have been calling you to give you space", "NAH. Parenting is hard. And despite all the competing literature there really is no guidebook. Raising tweens and teens is extra tough. In hindsight you can look back and see that you pushed him away and then felt rejected by him even though you say he reached out to you with texts monthly. It sounds like he gave you space, just too much. And neither one of you spoke to each other about it. Do I think he could have done better as a parent, yes. But not don\u2019t think he\u2019s an AH. Rejection is real for parents too. \nOn a side note, my husband has no idea how to navigate teen emotions. It\u2019s not his strong suit parenting. He absolutely loves his kids but I can see this happening with our kids if we separated if there was nobody to help guide his parenting through this stage. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case with your dad or not.", "NTA, but you can always pick up from there, now, today. Make plans with him. It wasn't your fault for not understanding the implications of your behavior as a 12 y.o. so write him. Write him now, that you want to meet. Because him not pressuring you to meet was his approach to accomodate your needs, because he didn't know you wanted him to put the effort to see you. He thought, you didn't and he cannot read minds. So he decided, I will not force contact, because OP is going to resent me. But not forcing contact has caused you to resent him. So, just write him or even better call him, tell him you want to meet!", "NTA.  You shouldn't have been allowed to make that choice at 12.\n\nBoth your mother and father should have made sure you continued to spend time with him.\n\nAt 12, kids nearly always prefer to spend time with their friends rather than do family things but that doesn't mean they get to.\n\nYour father abdicated his responsibilities.", "Your dad did nothing wrong. He did what you asked. If he had forced you to interact with him and see him you would have resented him more. You were bored of spending time with him, that would have hurt a lot to hear so in fear of pushing you to hate spending time altogether he backed off and supported your decision. He kept in contact to show that he was still there, it is your duty now to restart the relationship as he is waiting on you. Just pick up the phone and ask to go out for food or something, I am sure he will want to he probably still thinks you don\u2019t want to spend time with him. Theres no point placing blame anywhere, you were a kid. You can\u2019t rewind time but you can change the future.\n\nNah because you were a kid but if you continue to blame him then Y T A.", "Did he see your sister during this time?", "12yo, you were a child. the adult has to make an effort to be with you and contact you. he didn't.\n\nI think he acted like a child when he dedided to get his own back at you", "YTA\n\nYou said you didnt want to see him anymore on weekends. He said he would give you space...well 10 yrs later you arent 12 anymore.\n\nWhere is your personal responsibility to initiate some time with your dad?  All your dad knows is you dont like or want to spend time with him.    \n\nMaybe pick up the phone and ask him for a meal...you are 22...", "YTA\n\nYou said you didn\u2019t want to see him and he respected that. Now as an adult you feel he should\u2019ve tried harder to \u2018make plans to see you\u2019. If he had done so and pushed you to spend time with him then you\u2019d have resented him for that too. If he\u2019d made you see him then, you\u2019d now be complaining that he \u2018ruined your childhood\u2019\n\nPoor guy can\u2019t do right for doing wrong. Whatever he\u2019d have done when you were a child you\u2019d be on here complaining about it as an adult. \n\nHe\u2019s been staying in touch with you for 10 years whilst respecting your decision to not actually see him, when you have made no attempt at all to contact him. I suggest you grow up, text him, and ask if he\u2019d like to meet up. It\u2019s about time you made some effort if you want any kind of father-daughter relationship going forward.", "Oh, NTA. It is adult's and adult's only responsibility to keep in touch with their underaged children. Texting one time per month is nothing.", "NTA! It was your dad's responsibility to keep in contact with you. You were just a kid!", "NTA. To me your dad is the asshole all the way.", "I didn\u2019t even have to read it. No your not the AH.", "YTA you said you no longer wanted to see your father. That's what you did. A 12 year old knows what that means. You ruined that relationship and will never get those 10 years back. You'll regret that for the rest of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At twelve, it is the parent's responsibility to maintain contact and a good relationship.  You have a lazy AH dad.", "The reality is, we teach our kids to tell us what they want and we teach them about respectful relationships. You're parents agreed to allowing you the arrangement you wanted which is great....and your dad decided to respect your decision to not see him by not pushing you to spend time with him when you said you didn't want to. But he made efforts to let you know to you were on his mind. But you think that means he didn't fight for you or put in enough effort? \nThat's like breaking up with someone cos you don't see a future with them and being pissed they didn't hunt you down begging for your love and affection. \nYep, you were 12 at the start, but mate, it's taken you 10 years to loose the victim", "NTA- its not your responsibility to maintain a relationship with your father. He has made no real effort to see you for ten years- he should feel terrible about that. You where a child- and are still hia child- he choose to have a child and then stopped visiting the child because the kid didn't want to spend weekends in a community they had no conection to? He sounds like a selfish, lazy, selfcentered asshole.", "NTA When you turned 12 you grew out of wanting to just hang out at his house with him, so he promised you dinners out and trips. But he didn't come through for you on that, he didn't come and see you. He never once asked if you'd like to go to a museum, or a concert, to the movies, or theatre or even take you and a bunch of your friends to an adventure park, or water park, or aquarium. That is all on him, completely. He took your, don't want to hang out with boring dad at his place, to completely cut you off and punish you and that was entirely his doing. We used to take our kids and a bunch of their friends out when they got to that awkward, want to hang out with friends age. He could of taken you all on a cool outing. We took our kids and their friends, riding, kayaking on a lake, adventure parks etc, shopping in the city etc. Don't blame yourself, he could of fixed this.", "NTA. To me, it doesn\u2019t sound like you said \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you anymore\u201d but rather you didn\u2019t want to spend the whole weekend anymore. Your initial situation sounds a lot like mine - parents got divorced and I would spend every other weekend at Dad\u2019s place. But I wanted to hang out with my friends, who all lived in Mom\u2019s neighborhood. \n\nThey respected my decision to not spend the weekend, and here is where we differed. My dad followed through with the plan they made. He picked me up from any after-school activity that ended when he was off work, so we\u2019d spend half an hour in the car together. He helped organize camping trips twice a year (with my friends and their dads too!) so we got to go on fun trips. And he would text and ask if I wanted to get brunch or dinner - if I was busy that was fine and if not he would pick me up, or we would meet there once I could drive. He made an effort to still show up in the ways that worked for both of us and he never missed a game, or play, or graduation. \n\nAt 12 years old, of course you wanted to be where the fun was. I\u2019m sorry to hear your dad didn\u2019t follow through with the plan. To me, it makes sense that if he stopped trying to make any plans with you when you were so young, you wouldn\u2019t be reaching back out to make plans with him when you got older either. But I hope for you both that you can still repair the relationship, and get to know each other again.", "Its never to late to reach out! Im pretty sure he will be overjoyed when you text him honestly! A simple hey, I think be both drifted away from each other in the last years, lets fix this", "NAH. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you talk to him about how you\u2019re feeling, or maybe at the very least show him that you want a relationship with him?", "thank you :)", "thank you :)!", "thx :)", "thank you so much!", "thank you so much :)", "thank you!", "thank you for your words and experience. this helps me understand his situation much better!", "thank you so much!", "sometimes but not often. they met maybe once a year and then sometimes more often. if she doesn\u2019t ask to meet him they don\u2019t see eachother. but he also always texts her even when she doesn\u2019t for months", "thank you !", "thx!"]}
