My aunt called me today asking me to not to go because she finally scheduled her open heart surgery and it falls a few days into our trip. I told her I would love to be there for her but I wouldn\u2019t cancel this trip she started crying and yelling at me that she needs her family during these difficult times and that I could go to Europe another time. I told her I loved her and hung up. \n\nA little background my family is very close and even though we don\u2019t always get along with her we have always been there to help her. My aunt has never really taken care of herself health wise and always has had my mom to help nurse her back to health even though she has two grown children living with her. About 3 years ago her heart started giving her issues but she refused to see a doctor for it. My mother had a surgery last year and made a decision to step back from helping my aunt as much so she finally decided to see a doctor. They found an unknown object in her heart and told her surgery would be her only option but her chances weren\u2019t the best now this was a year ago. \n\nEveryone has been extra caring for her and my aunt has been loving the attention during this past year. We have been basically at her side anytime she needs anything. She has scheduled and canceled surgery twice each time the entire family comes together to have a big dinner with her. At this point I feel as if she really doesn\u2019t care about her health it\u2019s more about having everyone do things for her.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t be alone during surgery the rest of the family plans to be with her it\u2019s only me that wouldn\u2019t be there. Personally I\u2019m at a point in my life that I can\u2019t be at her every call anymore.

I have a family member who never took care of her health and were more than happy to sit back and let everyone take care of her. It was all self-made health issues, like real ones but ones that could have been avoided or mitigated if she had taken better care of herself. We all begged and pleaded, said we didn't want her golden years to be spent in a wheelchair but she didn't listen. Now she's as old as she's been acting and having real major health issues that are compounded by decades of poor health decisions. And now what do we do? Be mean to an old lady? Refuse to help her because she wouldn't help herself? The fact that this was all so avoidable makes it hard for me to be sympathetic at this point.\n\nIt's exhausting, frustrating and sometimes you just hit your limit.

OP should enjoy her entire vacation, no matter what happens with her aunt's surgery.", "How is she not to blame? A year ago she was told she had a blockage in her heart and needed surgery right away. She cancelled TWICE. That\u2019s a choice. She is making the choice to not care for herself and let the situation escalate to emergency status. OP has to give this context because people will give a y-ta rating for prioritizing a trip over a relationship that may end in death soon.
