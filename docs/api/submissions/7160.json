My aunt called me today asking me to not to go because she finally scheduled her open heart surgery and it falls a few days into our trip. I told her I would love to be there for her but I wouldn\u2019t cancel this trip she started crying and yelling at me that she needs her family during these difficult times and that I could go to Europe another time. I told her I loved her and hung up. \n\nA little background my family is very close and even though we don\u2019t always get along with her we have always been there to help her. My aunt has never really taken care of herself health wise and always has had my mom to help nurse her back to health even though she has two grown children living with her. About 3 years ago her heart started giving her issues but she refused to see a doctor for it. My mother had a surgery last year and made a decision to step back from helping my aunt as much so she finally decided to see a doctor. They found an unknown object in her heart and told her surgery would be her only option but her chances weren\u2019t the best now this was a year ago. \n\nEveryone has been extra caring for her and my aunt has been loving the attention during this past year. We have been basically at her side anytime she needs anything. She has scheduled and canceled surgery twice each time the entire family comes together to have a big dinner with her. At this point I feel as if she really doesn\u2019t care about her health it\u2019s more about having everyone do things for her.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t be alone during surgery the rest of the family plans to be with her it\u2019s only me that wouldn\u2019t be there.

We all begged and pleaded, said we didn't want her golden years to be spent in a wheelchair but she didn't listen.

I would want them to go on their trip.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, though be prepared to have some bridges burned.", "The fact that she's physically able to survive cancelling this surgery TWICE tells me that she'll be just fine without you. Enjoy your vacation OP! NTA.", "NTA\n\n***Everyone has been extra caring for her and my aunt has been loving the attention during this past year. We have been basically at her side anytime she needs anything. She has scheduled and canceled surgery twice each time the entire family comes together to have a big dinner with her. At this point I feel as if she really doesn\u2019t care about her health it\u2019s more about having everyone do things for her.***\n\nShe is milking it for all its worth.  Time to pull back.   When your family asks why tell them this:  Health care.  It means you have to Care about your Health.", "> I have a family member who never took care of her health and were more than happy to sit back and let everyone take care of her. It was all self-made health issues, like real ones but ones that could have been avoided or mitigated if she had taken better care of herself. We all begged and pleaded, said we didn't want her golden years to be spent in a wheelchair but she didn't listen.\n\nIs there a psychological term for people like OP's aunt and your family member who love the attention and / or power trip of holding people emotionally hostage?", "NTA it could be that she might be scared because if the surgery but you need to live your life too and enjoy this vacation", "I'm sorry but I really sounds like you're whole family is enablers. Including you despite the fact your getting real close to being out of the fog. Auntie only is like this cause your mom and others set the precedent. Now if, like your mom, you pull back to a more balanced relationship auntie gonna think you're taking something from her. Tbh wouldn't be surprised if she cancelled this appointment because \"I just feel so unsupported! It's all OPs fault!\" Nta but be ready for the storm and stand your ground!", "NTA! She\u2019s scheduled and canceled twice. She has grown kids living with her. She\u2019s just using this as an excuse and wants you to be there to wait on her hand and foot too. Enjoy your trip to Europe!", "NTA, it's very costly to rebook a trip like that and as there are other people who can help her. She just sounds selfish.", "NTA, while this does seem a bit unfortunate, I wouldn't cancel plans as big as that for this. You are allowed to travel, she will not be alone and she will probably have people closer to her there.", "NTA. Sounds like aunt is entitled and taking advantage of everyone. Go on your trip. I bet that if you cancelled the trip, she will probably cancel the surgery AGAIN. If she does have the surgery, she has others to help her out while you are gone.\n\nWhen you go, I hope you turn your phone off or better yet, block them all and unblock them when you get back. You don't need her or anyone else harassing and guilt-tripping you while you are away on your very much needed vacation.\n\nWhen you get back, it might be time to consider going low contact with her and anyone who may bother/guilt trip you about it too. In other words, start setting some hard boundaries.", "NTA\n\nShe won\u2019t be alone, she has support, and you can\u2019t stop living your life because she keeps changing her surgery date.\n\nYou can visit with her before her surgery and before your trip.", "NTA. She has other family to help her, so you are fine to go on vacation.", "NTA\n\nShe has support. \n\nShe wants attention. \n\nGo on the trip and turn off notifications. Your family will hound you for going but that\u2019s not your problem to be there for aunt. Who is to say she won\u2019t just cancel and rebook when your postponed trip came up again?\n\nIt might also be a good idea to chat to your family about your aunt\u2019s behaviour and to dial down the attention. If she was that concerned she wouldn\u2019t hVe canceled it twice.", "That's not what the previous poster is saying. They aren't saying aunt isn't to blame. They're saying the aunt isn't OP's responsibility. That it doesn't matter if it's aunt's fault because aunt has the entire rest of the family there to deal with her and OP's presence is unnessary.", "Right? OP isn\u2019t a cardiac surgeon, so wth would she be on call for her aunt? If auntie wants to get better, she doesn\u2019t need her family at her beck and call, she needs to follow through with her medical care.", "Have fun on your vacation!", "NTA Go on the trip. ignore the attention seeking behavior. She's not your responsability and has two adults who live with her to take care of her.", "NTA. Go on your trip, have a good time. Tell her she's rescheduled her surgery a couple if tumes, so you'll probably be around for when she reschedules this surgery", "I'm not going to give any judgement. Is it possible your aunt is worried she won't survive the surgery? Surgeries have a risk of death, especially open heart surgery. She could be worried she won't wake up, and you won't be there to say goodbye", "NTA. Live your life, and it doesn't evolve around her. This is the 3rd time it's been scheduled, who's to say it won't again, and you guys change your plans and she doesn't do it and it lands on the next time you plan? No. You go and at very most, bring back something for her.", "NTA ho on your vacation & enjoy it. I'm a Healthcare worker & you cannot help those who won't help themselves.", "NTA. This is like Munchausen\u2019s syndrome except that your aunt is actually sick; whereas someone with Munchausen\u2019s is exaggerating or faking illness for the attention they get. She needs therapy because it does seem as though she\u2019s using her medical condition to get the family\u2019s attention. \n\nI\u2019ll bet anything that your aunt decides to cancel the surgery again and blames your absence for it. Don\u2019t fall for the inevitable guilt trips that come your way. Shut people down as soon as they try. Just hang up the phone if they bring it up , or if you\u2019re in person walk away. Go on your vacation and please put your phone on dtd. Don\u2019t even think about checking it. \n\nOn a more serious side note; has anyone gone to these medical appointments with you aunt. Having \u201can unknown object\u201d inside of your heart is super serious. This isn\u2019t the type of thing that would be able to be put off for a year. Nor does it sound like it would be something that wouldn\u2019t progress to the point of being an emergent situation. I would question if I\u2019m being told the entire truth or a partial truth.\n\nTake your vacation. Have fun.", "NTA she\u2019ll probably cancel her surgery after you agree to cancel your vacation to stay with her. Don\u2019t let her take advantage of your kindness anymore. She\u2019s got her own kids that can take care of her if she really needs it.", "Same.  It'd be NTA even if she had never cancelled and has an impeccable record because she does have other people to rely on. \n\nBut with the cancellations? Hard no.  \n\nFrankly unless op has sat in on the doctor's appointment at an accredited hospital to confirm the surgeries were schedule - I don't believe they even were.", "This was my thought too. the risk of death is super high being open heart surgery. And she doesn't want OP to regret not being there to say goodbye. I work as a CNA in a LTC facility. Often times, I've been the family member next to a resident that passed away because their family wasn't, and they always come too late...a lot of people regret not staying there when we tell them they are actively passing and will be gone within two days", "She may very well be to blame, it\u2019s just that OP doesn\u2019t even need to assign blame to be well within her moral rights.", "INFO \n\n> They found an unknown object in her heart and told her surgery would be her only option but her chances weren\u2019t the best now this was a year ago. \n\nHow sure are you that this is true? I mean, being told you need life saving surgery then cancelling it TWICE is rather odd.", "NTA so she has 2 grown daughters and your mum she doesn't need the whole family there", "NTA she\u2019s loving the attention so she\u2019s risking her life that\u2019s on her. No chance would I cancel it. She has others she doesn\u2019t need you", "NTA\n\nMy mom had open heart surgery and didn't even think of canceling it ONCE. She went in and had it done. She's now better but I still watch her when I go visit weekly.", "NTA she has her own children so I don\u2019t understand what she thinks you can do that they can\u2019t??", "NTA Move on emotionally. The drama must be exhausting.  Help when you want to, but don't schedule things around her made up emergencies. Take care of yourself and your mom.", "There are multiple people perfectly capable of helping her who are in fact more closely related than you are. If she wasn't so selfish, she would be glad that you're helping her and then taking some time of for the trip. \n\nNTA of course. I don't understand the need to have entire family just wait home or at the hospital for your medical issues. It's frankly very over the top and not the norm in my country.", "NTA. She's manipulated the situation multiple times. She has live in children who can care for her. In my family we had a similar-ish situation (the operation was scheduled after the trip was booked) and the person going into surgery ENCOURAGED the vacationer to go. Family supports each other's dreams as well as they support heath.", "NTA.\n\nMy grandma twice cancelled supposed planned vacations to see our family when we lived across the map at the time because of two different surgeries a family member had. She brings it up all the time about how she\u2019s never really traveled, never really had a \u2018real vacation\u2019, etc. It pisses me off to no other because it\u2019s a choice she made over and over again, now she\u2019s getting too old to have the ability to travel and do the things she opted not to do in order to be there for others.\n\nGenerally just cancelling or rescheduling any trip a month out isn\u2019t easy, and sometimes can come with fees or total loss on some aspects. Aside from that, you can\u2019t cancel or reschedule everything in life to be at someone else\u2019s every beckoning call. What if you canceled the trip and then she decided to reschedule AGAIN?! \n\nI feel like she\u2019s guilt tripping and manipulating you.\nShe will have people who are there for her, and with all luck surgery will go as planned. \nIf anything, I\u2019d see/offer to call or FaceTime when she\u2019s out of surgery. If you ask me, wouldn\u2019t she rather you go have a great trip so you have plenty of stories, photos, videos, maybe even souvenirs to show her when you\u2019re back? If it was my niece I\u2019d want them to live their life and go on that trip instead of worrying about me or being by my side. Why is everyone who will be there for her not enough? With all these reschedules.. maybe *she* should reschedule her surgery around your vacation (kidding, but!)"]}
