I live with him for about 18ish months before I moved out for college. I was 16 and graduated at 17 and moved out for college that summer. My younger sisters were a lot younger than me and lived with him a lot longer. Our dad died 3 years before mom met Jackson, my youngest sister never remembered dad. I think mom and Jackson thought the youngest would consider Jackson her dad at least. Even though I wasn't living at home I have always been close to my three sisters and they'd spend weekends with me and they'd call me for advice and I would call to check on them, etc. I would also hear the complaints about mom and Jackson over the years. I guess it made me more of a protective and supportive figure in their lives.\n\nNow two of my sister's are engaged and both asked me to be the one to walk them down the aisle and both wanted me to dance with them to honor our dad. I agreed to both. One is getting married this year, the other next year. My baby sister isn't getting married but when it came up to mom and Jackson that the older girls had asked and wanted me, she told them she'd ask me as well one day. Jackson asked her about himself and she said he's fine and all, but I'm someone who can represent dad for her and that I am the person she is much closer to.\n\nMy mom and Jackson did not take it well that two of my sisters already asked me and that the youngest plans to one day as well. Mom decided she was going to talk to me about it and she started off by saying how hurt Jackson is, and how Jackson is feeling very underappreciated, how it's difficult for him to accept that I was asked over him when I didn't even live with them in their more formative years. She also said the fact I am not close to him and he's not really known by my kids (neither is my mom, we're not very close) makes him feel as though he will never be known as grandpa and will always just be mom/grandpa's husband and the love he has for them will be unreciprocated. She told me how he deserves to be a priority and he is her priority right now and he should be mine as well. She said it would make her happy and repair our relationship as well (our lack of closeness started when I posted a tribute to my dad on social media one father's day while I was attending college and mom asked why I didn't include both my dad's and we ended up with a troubled relationship because she couldn't accept that I did not have two dad's and that Jackson was not a paternal part of my life). She told me to tell the girls they should ask Jackson to do these things instead and do \"the right thing\". I told her the decision was the girls' and they had already made it. She then brought up prioritizing Jackson's feelings and I told her he is not my priority and never will be and she needs to deal with that. She told me I had not grown up, that a father of two should know better and Jackson deserves better than this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682243060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w31fe/aita_for_telling_my_mom_her_husband_isnt_a/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is it so common?  That when a parent re-marries, he/she expects the biological kids to re-marry also?  That is, the assumption is that if mom has a new husband, then her kids have a new father.  ????????????????", "NTA - Jackson is not your dad, nor the dad to your three sisters.  They have no reason to expect you especially, to think of him as a Father figure.  If your sisters want you to do the father of the bride events at their weddings then it is their choice.  \n\nGood luck, your mom sounds tiring to be around.", "NTA - If your sister asked you to walk her down the aisle, that is between your sister and jackson, you are just doing as asked.\n\nIf you are not close with your mom or jackson, why would they be a priority for you?", "NTA. You pretty much framed it perfectly yourself. Jackson is not your father, and you will never see him that way, especially at this point. And you never had any obligation to see him differently. \n\nMost of all, you've done exactly what you should have done this entire time: you made your sisters your priority. That was critical because your mother made the mistake that so many remarried parents make. She tried to completely replace the deceased parent with the new stepparent. With older kids, this is almost always a mistake. It obviously was here, but your sisters were incredibly lucky to have you there to talk to.\n\nKeep being awesome and hold your head high when you walk them down the aisle. And of course, keep being there for your sisters. Being there for your stepfather is your mother's job and your mother's job alone.", "NTA. I don't understand what your mum wants to get out of this? A wedding day tribute would not improve  relationships overall. This is clearly more about how others at the wedding will perceive this; your mum and Jackson are worried that wedding guests will see you taking the \"father of the bride\" place, and that somehow suggesting that Jackson wasn't a good enough father figure to them.\n\nJackson can be sad about it, but that's his problem, not yours or your sisters.", "NTA. She's delusional.\n\n>She also said the fact I am not close to him and he's not really known by my kids (neither is my mom, we're not very close)\n\n>the love he has for them will be unreciprocated.\n\nThis doesn't match up.\n\n>She told me how he deserves to be a priority and he is her priority right now and he should be mine as well.\n\nThere's no reason why he should be your priority. Your sisters, however, clearly are. NTA all day long.", "NTA, you didn't marry him.\n\nIf Jackson didn't curate the type of relationship in which your sisters want to ask him to walk them down the aisle then that's on him and your mother for the situation, not you.", "NTA. You were an adult when your mum got remarried. What would she have thought if the roles were reversed, and after raising you for 15 years, your dad wanted you to call a stranger \"mom\" after she died? I understand that your baby sister was raised by this man, but it sounds like she's trying to act like your dad never existed to the youngest.\n\nI think it's lovely that your sisters want you to walk them down the aisle. By the sounds of it, you're as much as a father figure as their step dad, and you share your dad's blood, so it's like having part of him there.\n\nI do understand why the step dad is upset. He's been a big part of your sisters' lives. But he has no right to try to guilt trip them/ have your mum guilt trip them on her behalf. If they don't see him as a dad, he can't force it. The wedding is about what the bride and groom want, not what the stepfather of the bride wants.", "NTA. Jackson is not your father. It\u2019s sad your mother sabotaged any loving relationship you might have had with him by criticizing you for remembering your real father, the man who raised and loved you, on Father\u2019s Day. It\u2019s not a stretch to believe she tried to force a father like relationship with Jackson on your sisters. Those relationships are built on foundations of empathy for what the children have lost. I\u2019m not sure Jackson has done anything wrong. It sounds like your mother is the pushy one, but she may be acting at Jackson\u2019s direction.", "NTA - keep being an awesome big brother!", "NTA. Why does your mother expect her husband to be your priority?\n\nYour siblings are capable of making their own decisions. If they asked you to walk them down the aisle, that's their decision. I don't understand why your mothers new husband expects to be in the position, nor do I understand why his feelings are supposed to matter more than your siblings.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Mom decided she was going to talk to me about it\" .. tell mom not to talk to YOU, because this really is not your decission, and you are right to support your sisters in the way THEY want. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"he then brought up prioritizing Jackson's feelings and I told her he is not my priority and never will be and she needs to deal with that. She told me I had not grown up\" .. you are acting that way BECAUSE you have grown up nicely.", "NTA, Jackson is not your dad, and it's your sisters choice for who walks them down the aisle. Jackson's feelings don't need to be a priority for you because, honestly, it's his own unreasonable expectations that seem to be letting him down. He seems to think that your siblings must think of him as their father, and he is entitled to certain things because he is now the father figure. Well, it doesn't matter if you are the stepfather or the biological father, or whatever, that does not entitle him to any love or privileges or anything like that. Stuff like that is earned, not automatically given, and I feel like he doesn't think that way.", "Mom is living in lala land. You can\u2019t make your kids accept a man you married if they aren\u2019t willing to accept him. She made Jackson her priority and I can guarantee that her kids aren\u2019t a priority to her at all. Nta", "NTA. I hope all the step parents on this sub see how being pushy is exactly the wrong thing to do.", "NTA.  I see a lot of posts where a parent gets remarried and expects the children to accept the spouse as the new mother/father. That\u2019s simply unrealistic.  The fact that your mom fell in love and married this guy is great but that doesn\u2019t automatically mean any of you will accept him as your new father.  You aren\u2019t her.  She and Jackson both need to understand that and he should embrace and appreciate the relationship he does have with the kids before he ends up pushing them away.", "Time to get downvoted to hell!\n\nOP you are NTA.  But your mom is also not an asshole.  It seems to me that she\u2019s trying to include Jackson in your lives the right way.\n\nThe only asshole here is Jackson for actively trying to be Dad to your younger siblings.", "NTA for this. However, you all should maybe figure out how to include your step dad. He's hurt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not what your mom's husband wants. It's understandable that he is disappointed, that's normal. What's not normal is your mom basically demanding you reject your sister's request that you walk them down the aisle.  Ignore your mom and have a great time at your sister's weddings.", "NTA   I just don't get these parents trying to foist their new partners off as the replacement for the dead parent.   The world doesn't work that way.  You had a father.  The girls had a father.  He's unfortunately gone.  I'm glad your mother found someone to spend the rest of her life with, but trying to force a relationship that is not wanted only means pushing the children away so neither the step or the bio parent will be in the children's life in the future.  It's stupid.", "NTA\nEnjoy those weddings and make sure your sisters have the best day and the biggest smiles. Your mom will not ruin this for them at all. Speak to your sisters and make sure they stand their ground and don't get pushed around. Be there rock. You are awesome.", "I think the assumption came with the baby of the family because she couldn't remember dad and I think mom believed that would mean she could slot another dad in there and it would work. For the rest of us. I guess she thought him living with the girls longer would make him their second dad. I never did understand why she thought I would consider the man a dad and why it bothered her so much that I didn't. The man had really no impact on my life directly. He had it through them, sure. But I never met someone who was as old as I was when I met Jackson, who lived with him for such a short period, who then considered their parent's new spouse another parent. The fact mom felt he deserved a tribute from me for Father's Day and not my dad was crazy.", "She didn't use to be but she is when it comes to Jackson.", "My assumption is mom believes I want to change that. But she set the tone by being weird about her adult son who was never raised by her husband not honoring him for Father's Day.", "She wants Jackson to feel like he is a dad. She wants him to feel like he is loved and seen the way he wants to be seen and the way he has tried to be in their lives. I don't think this is about how everyone else sees it at all. He went into his marriage to mom thinking he would be a dad, ready to be a dead, but not ready or wanting to be a stepdad.", "I think the issue is he tried to hard to be dad instead of being stepdad and see if over time he would become dad. Like I said in another comment. He married thinking and wanting to be dad out of it but did not want to be stepdad and it has messed some things up.", "Mom is not only asking her kids to change their feelings and sacrifice their wedding choices for her husband, valuing her husband's ego over her kids' happiness, but she's calling them evil for not valuing her husband's ego over their happiness. That makes Mom the AH.", "I disagree that she is trying to include him the right way. She should never expect her husband\u2019s feelings to be prioritized over those of her children. She should never have gotten angry that OP made a Father\u2019s Day post that didn\u2019t include her husband. Love and relationships are earned. Jackson expected a father son relationship with OP after lived with him for a little over a year. Mom is going to end up losing all of her children if she refuses to stop crossing boundaries. NTA", ">  It seems to me that she\u2019s trying to include Jackson in your lives the right way.\n\nThe 'right way'? How? By convincing OP to disrespect their sisters' wishes so their only alternative will be Jackson?", "You're right.... about getting down voted.", "Your mom definitely set the tone on this from the get-go. NTA. \n\nHere are some ideas. Ask your sisters if they plan to include Jackson in the wedding in some way and if not, they might consider either sitting down with him and having a conversation. It is not your responsibility to manage the relationship your sisters have with him. It is inappropriate of your mother to ask you to decline as it\u2019s not her wedding and your sister, the BRIDE, has asked you. \n\nYou might also consider a conversation with Jackson as well. More of a \u201chey man, I want to help manage some expectations as I don\u2019t want hurt feelings. I don\u2019t see you as a paternal figure in my life here\u2019s why\u2026 my sister has asked me to walk her down the aisle and to participate in the dance, I\u2019m going to honor her wishes. I know that it may be difficult for you but the wedding isn\u2019t about either of us and we should really prioritize what (BRIDE) wants since this is about her and her husband to be.\u201d", "This is really so sad for him. Was he a good step dad to your sisters?", "Well his gonna have to buck up and accept the situation because you can't unscrew the pooch.", "Can you elaborate on this? What does 'tried to be dad and not stepdad' mean exactly? Was he supportive of the kids, give an effort to be there, come to sports games/other extra curricular events, etc?\n\nIf he was making demands to be called dad and/or wasn't really there for you then him and your mom are definitely TA. If he made a real effort to be a parent then I feel bad for him, but nobody is TA. Your sisters have every right to have whoever they want involved in their wedding.", "He never really tried being their stepdad.", "You should not marry someone with kids with the expectation that they will see you as a parent.", "Well, than there\u2019s not much he can complain about, is there?", "Exactly. Try to be a good stepparent and let it develop naturally to whatever it becomes. The second you enter a marriage thinking that automatically makes you mom or dad to the kids you are damning it before it's ever had a chance to be what you ultimately want.", "There is in his own head. Because he wasn't a stepdad, he was dad. That is where the problems started and continued. At no point did he go in realistic and accept that simply marrying mom didn't mean he was now a dad. He could have built up to that if he had started off as a great and caring stepdad. Instead he went in as what he wanted to be, rather than what he was in reality. He never tried that stuff with me but my guess is he thought all three of my sister's would just accept that he wanted to be dad.\n\nI think he might have gotten what he ultimately wanted if he had built up to it first. But can't change the past and he shouldn't be super shocked when none of them have ever called him dad. Yet he appears to be."]}
