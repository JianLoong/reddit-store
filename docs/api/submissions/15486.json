I live with him for about 18ish months before I moved out for college. I was 16 and graduated at 17 and moved out for college that summer. My younger sisters were a lot younger than me and lived with him a lot longer. Our dad died 3 years before mom met Jackson, my youngest sister never remembered dad. I think mom and Jackson thought the youngest would consider Jackson her dad at least. Even though I wasn't living at home I have always been close to my three sisters and they'd spend weekends with me and they'd call me for advice and I would call to check on them, etc. I would also hear the complaints about mom and Jackson over the years. I guess it made me more of a protective and supportive figure in their lives.\n\nNow two of my sister's are engaged and both asked me to be the one to walk them down the aisle and both wanted me to dance with them to honor our dad. I agreed to both. One is getting married this year, the other next year. My baby sister isn't getting married but when it came up to mom and Jackson that the older girls had asked and wanted me, she told them she'd ask me as well one day. Jackson asked her about himself and she said he's fine and all, but I'm someone who can represent dad for her and that I am the person she is much closer to.\n\nMy mom and Jackson did not take it well that two of my sisters already asked me and that the youngest plans to one day as well. Mom decided she was going to talk to me about it and she started off by saying how hurt Jackson is, and how Jackson is feeling very underappreciated, how it's difficult for him to accept that I was asked over him when I didn't even live with them in their more formative years. She also said the fact I am not close to him and he's not really known by my kids (neither is my mom, we're not very close) makes him feel as though he will never be known as grandpa and will always just be mom/grandpa's husband and the love he has for them will be unreciprocated. She told me how he deserves to be a priority and he is her priority right now and he should be mine as well. She said it would make her happy and repair our relationship as well (our lack of closeness started when I posted a tribute to my dad on social media one father's day while I was attending college and mom asked why I didn't include both my dad's and we ended up with a troubled relationship because she couldn't accept that I did not have two dad's and that Jackson was not a paternal part of my life). She told me to tell the girls they should ask Jackson to do these things instead and do \"the right thing\". I told her the decision was the girls' and they had already made it. She then brought up prioritizing Jackson's feelings and I told her he is not my priority and never will be and she needs to deal with that. She told me I had not grown up, that a father of two should know better and Jackson deserves better than this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682243060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w31fe/aita_for_telling_my_mom_her_husband_isnt_a/", "score": 809, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you never had any obligation to see him differently. \n\nMost of all, you've done exactly what you should have done this entire time: you made your sisters your priority. That was critical because your mother made the mistake that so many remarried parents make. She tried to completely replace the deceased parent with the new stepparent. With older kids, this is almost always a mistake. It obviously was here, but your sisters were incredibly lucky to have you there to talk to.\n\nKeep being awesome and hold your head high when you walk them down the aisle. And of course, keep being there for your sisters. Being there for your stepfather is your mother's job and your mother's job alone.", "NTA. I don't understand what your mum wants to get out of this?

By the sounds of it, you're as much as a father figure as their step dad, and you share your dad's blood, so it's like having part of him there.\n\nI do understand why the step dad is upset. He's been a big part of your sisters' lives. But he has no right to try to guilt trip them/ have your mum guilt trip them on her behalf. If they don't see him as a dad, he can't force it.

He seems to think that your siblings must think of him as their father, and he is entitled to certain things because he is now the father figure.

The fact that your mom fell in love and married this guy is great but that doesn\u2019t automatically mean any of you will accept him as your new father.  You aren\u2019t her.

This includes reciprocation, one does not simply step into a parent's shoes like this, you must enter into such things more gracefully. I find myself wondering if Jackson expressed his feelings privately and your mom decided to take it to you instead of letting it be.\n\nI'm also thinking your mom skipped therapy when your dad died and instead came to the conclusion that she needed to repair the family and she now sees you not viewing her choice as a father as rejecting her choice. She needs to go to therapy. I'm thinking Jackson needs to come to terms with accepting the relationship he has.", ">I think the assumption came with the baby of the family because she couldn't remember dad and I think mom believed that would mean she could slot another dad in there and it would work.\n\nholy shit... it's pretty obvious by the way you speak that you've let your biases taint your siblings perspective and that to me is unforgivable...", "Hey, I'm on AITA for the drama, not to talk about my mother.", "Jackson can be sad about it, but that's his problem, not yours or your sisters.", "Good luck, your mom sounds tiring to be around.", "I know that it may be difficult for you", "what\u2026", "\u201cTaint\u201d really?

Step parents cannot expect kids, no matter the age, to want to incorporate them into their lives. Jackson cannot just take the place of your dad. He can act as a paternal figure, but he'll never be dad. Sorry, but it's the truth.", "NTA. If Jackson is hurt by the decisions of your sisters, that's between him and your sisters and has nothing to do with you. Jackson is an adult who surely can express himself to them, on his own, without your mother's intervention. \nBut if your mom is so pressed, SHE can talk to your sisters.

The problem is when they react poorly to that not happening. It is okay for kids to not get attached to step parents and vice versa. Some folks have trouble accepting that. My current partner is so loved by my oldest child that the child often goes to my partner for advice and help rather than me and the other bio parent. The two of them go on trips together as well, just them. I have a step parent that adopted me (I wanted this) and I love. For me I consider them my true parent and I lucked out.
