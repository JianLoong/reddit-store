Do you talk to her regularly? Clear the air, and just say that it's your mom's ring and very important to you. She could have something from *her* mother, or her fiance's family, or just get married as planned. Did her fiance not give her a ring? Why?\n\nNTA at all.

It's sad that she's dying. But the truth is that she wants the ring because it's pretty, and it means more than aesthetics to you. Your dad and his wife want you to give it up because they're sad they are going to lose someone they love and they want to make as many connections as possible before she's gone forever. \n\nReality is, as you are well aware, engagement rings have so much emotion attached to them. The truth is that it isn't just a few months. For you, it is your mom's ring and important because it was hers. If Evelyn ever wears it then, for her family (including your dad), it will be thought of as *her* ring. What if her fianc\u00e9 gets attached and doesn't want to give it back? What if you use it in the future and your family goes on about \"Evelyn's\" ring? What will your fianc\u00e9 think of the family potentially resenting them for wearing a ring they no longer associate with you and your mother?

Evelyn has no relation to your mom so nobody should be asking for it for Evelyn. I think you offered a nice solution to give them some photos to replicate it if they wanted to.

Why would showing your mothers rings photos would be a bonding experience for your father and your step siblings? It is just bizarre.

And if she doesn't, you are asking a greiving husband to return her wifes wedding ring. \n\nI think replicating the ring or getting a new one are the sensible options here.

She has no emotional tie to that ring; she just wants it. \"I want it\" is not a good reason for you to hand over an heirloom specifically left for you.\n\nSecondly, if you did let her use it for whatever time she has left, there's absolutely no guarantee your stepmother wouldn't turn the tables and demand she be buried with 'her' engagement ring.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 should buy her one specifically for *her*, as opposed to allowing her to beg for something she has no right to. She deserves a ring that's meant for her, not a borrowed ring she'll have to part with when she meets her end. She's dying, the LEAST they could all do is get her something she can symbolically take with her.\n\nAnd yes I know she can't take the actual ring with her when she dies, but prying the jewellery off her fingers after death is leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth and frankly her parents and fianc\u00e9 should want more for her.

You've been reasonable to offer them pictures to make a copy. She can then be buried with it, which she wouldn't be able to do with yours.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. \n\nThe ring was kept for you, your mom even went out of her way to give it to her family to avoid your dad doing something with it. \n\nYour dad should understand how connected you feel for this, the fact he expects you to give it to her when she has 0 connection to your mom is bizarre to me. Guilting you makes me feel as if he\u2019s not looking for out for you, just your step sister. \n\nNTA, keep your family ring because I\u2019m with most others that you won\u2019t get that back for one reason or another.", "NTA. What was your father even thinking, showing her your mother\u2019s ring? If you did lend it to her, her husband would want to keep it. Lock it up in a safe deposit box at a bank your father has no connection to.", "NTA. \n\nWhen something like this happens, it\u2019s almost more likely that you\u2019d never get it back.

Someone with whom you have a **biological** connection. If Evelyn was your sister by blood, it *might* be a different story. But as it is, she\u2019s the child of a woman your dad married. No biological relation to you at all. Your mom wanted to keep the ring in the family, hence she gave it to you. \n\nThe cynical part of me wonders if your mother thought about your father moving on when she bequeathed it to you instead of him. Like maybe she couldn\u2019t trust that he wouldn\u2019t put it on someone else\u2019s finger one day. Like I said, cynical of me, but not completely unheard of. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about Evelyn\u2019s circumstances, but I don\u2019t think you should have to worry about \u201cloaning\u201d them something that belongs rightfully to you.

It's an heirloom within your family, gifted to you, to do what you like with.\n\nI, for one, would probably allow a dying girl that I knew to wear it for a few months before she passed, but that's just me. If I didn't know her well, or didn't like her, or had some strong connection to the ring(I'm not a sentimental type), I might not. But you're not me. Your values are your own and should be respected.

It's terrible that she is terminally ill. It's always tragic when someone so young has such a horrible diagnosis. But that has nothing to do with the fact that your mother's ring belongs to you. It's a shame they are weaponizing Evelyn's illness to try and shame you into giving up your mother's ring. And that's what would happen. No matter what anyone says, I doubt you would get it back.

You'd probably rather see them spend the rest of their days alone rather than meet someone new.\n\nBut when you're dying and making your partner a widow, it's completely different. You don't want them to stay single and mourn you forever. You want them to be happy. You want them to live their life and find someone else to love. You'd want your partner to have a new happy family.", "We don't get a say in our family. I didn't pick my relatives either. Just because OP didn't pick her doesn't mean she isn't his stepsister.", "Exactly.  This is an excellent point.  I like that you offered to help her find one that\u2019s special to her, though.  There\u2019s no reason this ring should be special for her, and I\u2019m pretty annoyed for you that she even knows about it.  When the uncle had it????   How bizarre.  And it honestly kind of explains why your mom would have her brother keep it for you instead of your dad.  Almost like she knew he couldn\u2019t be trusted when he remarried.  How sad.", "Exactly what I was thinking too, they are already being so forceful, if you don't stand your ground you aren't going to get it back. Best of luck to you\u2728\ufe0f \nNTA", ">Evelyn is not my mother's family.\n\nThat seems to be a real sticking point with you. Does the fact that your dad remarried bother you that much? It sounds like you have some feelings against the family.\n\nAgain, I'd be on your side if she didn't have a cancer diagnosis. But come on, you have a chance to make a dying girl genuinely happy. Someone your father cares deeply about. Wouldn't your mother want your father to be happy, at least?", "OP isn't even old enough to drink.", "Honestly, the person you're replying to is weird af. They're all over the thread attacking OP and accusing him of being jealous etc. They're weirdly invested in this, I suspect they're one of those asshole family members lol. If not, then they need to touch grass.", "He said he offered to give them a photo to do that but they want the actual ring. It's weird that and they have no right to demand it. They should not have even asked.", "He offered them pictures and they have design details to get a replica made. They still want the ring itself. Because they don\u2019t plan to give it back. It will \u201cjust mean too much\u201d to the fianc\u00e9 or the sister or the mom. Or maybe it\u2019ll be buried with stepsister. Amazing that you can\u2019t see that.", "That all depends on how your partner handles making that new happy family. But even if you were happy for them, you might not want that new family to get your stuff or you might not want them to have sentimentally valuable items that were yours.", "That\u2019s not the case for everybody and everybody has separate feelings about their inheritances and how they want their kid to be raised in the case they did pass. Ops mother has 0 connection or relation to the step sister and op doesn\u2019t really either considering it\u2019s been nearly a year since they\u2019ve even spoke and she didn\u2019t even have the audacity to ask herself but get her mother and fianc\u00e9 to harass op. It doesn\u2019t even matter at this point what the mother thinks, what matters is what op thinks because that\u2019s their property and if they don\u2019t think loaning it out to someone they never see or speak to, who\u2019s willing to harass him over this, an heirloom ring  that means the world to them and nothing to the sister than they don\u2019t have to.", "You are so wrong on this.", "Exactly my point- STEP sister. Zero connection to his mother or her ring. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s dying but if her only claim to it is \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty I want it\u201d then it isn\u2019t good enough. \nThe ring is for OP to give to whom HE chooses, he didn\u2019t chose his step sister.", "What happens if they refuse to return the ring? What happens if they decide she loved that ring so much she should be buried with it? Or it goes 'missing'?\nThey're trying to guilt OP into handing over something that should never have even been on the table. The ring is his and his no should be the end of it.", "The fact he remarried doesn't bother me but some stuff about it does, yes. I don't think my mom would want him to be happy with someone else using her ring. I think she'd want him to want it kept for her only child or grandchild. Not for his stepchild who is nothing to her.", "Her having cancer does nothing to the situation but make it clear she has unfortunate circumstances but that does not mean that you suddenly are entitled to other peoples belongings. This is an heirloom ring that is not worth losing to Ops fathers wife or step BIL in any case scenario, the ring has 0 significance or meaning to the step sister but does has a lot of meaning for op and risking it being damaged, lost, stolen etc just because his dads wife\u2019s kid got cancer is ridiculous. That ring is invaluable to op and while the step sister deserves empathy and care during her hard times, cancer isn\u2019t a \u201cI get what I want\u201d card.", "I have known a few very horrible dying people who make very horrible requests on their death bed. Should we fulfil every dying person\u2019s wish even if the request is horrible?   \nLike my friend\u2019s dying (now late) grandmother forcing her into promising not to marry her boyfriend because of his ethnicity.", ">But come on, you have a chance to make a dying girl genuinely happy\n\nWhy can't she be happy with a duplicate then? Asking someone to give up something of theirs, which holds a lot of sentiments isnt okay\n\nAlso its super likely that OP wont get it back because then stepmom and fiance would want to keep it because it becomes important to them afterwards\n\nNta op", "And your point is???", "I agree, the ring has sentimental value to you, your stepsister only wants it because it's pretty.\n\nThat's not a good enough reason.", "I think if OP was to cave in and give her the ring, they should make a contract that it is a loan and itll be given back when the stepsister sadly passes away. Just to make sure the widower and the stepmum don't try to make claim on the ring.\n\n'How dare you use your dead stepsisters wedding ring to propose' that sort of thing.", "But why jump to that \"what-if\" scenario? Why not just assume they are good people who will keep their word? Why are you so quick to assume the family will refuse to return the ring?\n\nThis subreddit is so quick to assume the worst in people. You're so paranoid.", "If you two were close and you were sure you could trust Evelyn, it may be a different story\u2014 but I\u2019m sorry, \u201cBecause it\u2019s pretty\u201d does not strike me as a good reason \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", ">Her having cancer does nothing to the situation\n\nIt COMPLETELY changes the situation. This is basically her last request, and OP will get the ring back in a few months after she dies.\n\nThe ring clearly has meaning and significance to the stepsister, given that she wrote an entire letter begging her stepbrother to let her borrow it. If any old ring would do, she wouldn't have bothered going to the effort. Seriously, she's dying of cancer, she has very little time left, and she took some of that precious time to write a letter asking for the ring. How can you say the ring has no meaning to her?\n\nYes there's a risk of it being lost or damaged, or stolen, but is OP really going to deny his dying stepsister this last wish of hers, merely on the *offchance* something happens to the ring?\n\nI just think it shows a complete lack of empathy. OP doesn't give a shit about his stepsister.", "This isn't an unreasonable request. She merely wants to *borrow* the ring for a few months before she *dies of cancer*.\n\nI am genuinely shocked that so many people are on OP's side. Seriously the lack of empathy on this sub is incredible.", "I don't agree with them either, but its pretty obvious that they're saying, \"Even if she's older than OP, she's still young.\"", "Good people would have accepted OP's no and moved on, not continue to harass and berate him for turning down their request. No is a complete sentence and doesn't need an explanation, it shouldn't be seen as a chance to wear someone down until you get the answer you want.", "Because they're trying to manipulate OP when he's already given his answer?\nIt's not just an assumption plucked out of thin air.", "Her step sister can get a duplicate ring made before her time is up. My jeweller and a few other jewellers can do it within a 2 week to a month mark. So can other jewellers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP offered to let them copy the design.So the short time span has nothing with wanting the ring.", "No it doesn\u2019t change anything actually. It doesn\u2019t matter if her dying wish was to get a house for free, have 1000000$ wedding or if it something as small as wanting a venue on a day it\u2019s already booked. The sister hasn\u2019t actually said a word to op and hasn\u2019t in nearly a year, they don\u2019t have a relationship and she\u2019s never even seen the ring, it has no significant value other than the fact she wants it and find it\u2019s pretty. There isn\u2019t a guarantee op will get the ring back and there are a million things that can go wrong in trying to get it back, it could be broken, it could be lost, it could be buried with her, it could be stolen by the fiance or mother, it could be considered legal martial properly being used in a wedding ceremony making op lose any legal rights to the ring, it could be sold, etc etc etc. It\u2019s sad and unfortunate she is dying but she has no ties to the ring, and is not entitled to it in anyway and having cancer doesn\u2019t change it at all. This ring is one of, if not the only thing op really has of his mothers and the only real heirloom going down generations on his moms side snd trying to bully and harass him into giving it up is cruel and wrong. The sister deserves care and love, not the right to just use other peoples property how they see fit.", "Why would a ring that she\u2019s only ever seen in pictures hold such significance? \n\nI wonder if OP\u2019s dad told the stepdaughters a tale of a love cut tragically short and symbolised by the custom-made ring (complete with design drawings and pictures that he never shared with his own son). Young girls are suckers for such romantic notions, especially if they can be tied into their own lives. \n\nNow such a devoted husband is a loving partner to their own mother. Maybe he already promised the ring to Evelyn, or she\u2019d expressed the desire for it over the years. \n\nIt\u2019s just that now the poor girl is terminally ill so the family (minus poor OP) will do anything to make her life a bit happier. \n\nToo bad about the boy who lost his mother and learned stories about her after they\u2019d been shared with unrelated people. \n\nNTA", "1. you never heard of sizing. OP\u2019s ring may not fit her stepsister\u2019s finger. Certain rings once they shrink it down, cannot be resized up. Or if it needs to be resized at all, the settings may not allow.\n2. easy to get a ring catalogue and buy one off the catalogue to fit her stepsister\u2018s ring finger.\n3. why are they so insistent and sure that the ring will fit the stepsister?  It is an old heirloom ring, some of which are very valuable due to the rarity of the gems or delicate hand labour gone into it which you don\u2019t see anymore.\n4. they have an alternative - make a duplicate based on the ring design. OP offered to let them do so which makes me think of no.3 - they want it for the value and they will NEVER give it back. \n5. takes around 2 weeks to a month to do a duplicate - so a ring can be made within those few months left in the stepsister\u2019s life. Right?"]}
