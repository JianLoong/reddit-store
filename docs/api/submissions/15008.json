Do you talk to her regularly? Clear the air, and just say that it's your mom's ring and very important to you.

Your dad and his wife want you to give it up because they're sad they are going to lose someone they love and they want to make as many connections as possible before she's gone forever. \n\nReality is, as you are well aware, engagement rings have so much emotion attached to them. The truth is that it isn't just a few months. For you, it is your mom's ring and important because it was hers. If Evelyn ever wears it then, for her family (including your dad), it will be thought of as *her* ring. What if her fianc\u00e9 gets attached and doesn't want to give it back?

Evelyn has no relation to your mom so nobody should be asking for it for Evelyn. I think you offered a nice solution to give them some photos to replicate it if they wanted to.

Why would showing your mothers rings photos would be a bonding experience for your father and your step siblings? It is just bizarre.

And if she doesn't, you are asking a greiving husband to return her wifes wedding ring. \n\nI think replicating the ring or getting a new one are the sensible options here.

She has no emotional tie to that ring; she just wants it. \"I want it\" is not a good reason for you to hand over an heirloom specifically left for you.\n\nSecondly, if you did let her use it for whatever time she has left, there's absolutely no guarantee your stepmother wouldn't turn the tables and demand she be buried with 'her' engagement ring.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 should buy her one specifically for *her*, as opposed to allowing her to beg for something she has no right to. She deserves a ring that's meant for her, not a borrowed ring she'll have to part with when she meets her end. She's dying, the LEAST they could all do is get her something she can symbolically take with her.\n\nAnd yes I know she can't take the actual ring with her when she dies, but prying the jewellery off her fingers after death is leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth and frankly her parents and fianc\u00e9 should want more for her. Shame on them.", "NTA\n\nThe ring has a lot of sentimental value to YOU, not her and there\u2019s a slight chance you might not be able to get it back due to one reason or the other.

You've been reasonable to offer them pictures to make a copy. She can then be buried with it, which she wouldn't be able to do with yours.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. \n\nThe ring was kept for you, your mom even went out of her way to give it to her family to avoid your dad doing something with it. \n\nYour dad should understand how connected you feel for this, the fact he expects you to give it to her when she has 0 connection to your mom is bizarre to me. Guilting you makes me feel as if he\u2019s not looking for out for you, just your step sister. \n\nNTA, keep your family ring because I\u2019m with most others that you won\u2019t get that back for one reason or another.", "NTA.

Someone with whom you have a **biological** connection. If Evelyn was your sister by blood, it *might* be a different story. But as it is, she\u2019s the child of a woman your dad married. No biological relation to you at all. Your mom wanted to keep the ring in the family, hence she gave it to you. \n\nThe cynical part of me wonders if your mother thought about your father moving on when she bequeathed it to you instead of him. Like maybe she couldn\u2019t trust that he wouldn\u2019t put it on someone else\u2019s finger one day. Like I said, cynical of me, but not completely unheard of. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about Evelyn\u2019s circumstances, but I don\u2019t think you should have to worry about \u201cloaning\u201d them something that belongs rightfully to you.

It's an heirloom within your family, gifted to you, to do what you like with.\n\nI, for one, would probably allow a dying girl that I knew to wear it for a few months before she passed, but that's just me. If I didn't know her well, or didn't like her, or had some strong connection to the ring(I'm not a sentimental type), I might not. But you're not me. Your values are your own and should be respected.

It's terrible that she is terminally ill. It's always tragic when someone so young has such a horrible diagnosis. But that has nothing to do with the fact that your mother's ring belongs to you. It's a shame they are weaponizing Evelyn's illness to try and shame you into giving up your mother's ring. And that's what would happen. No matter what anyone says, I doubt you would get it back.

Not only that, as op has mentioned even if they did give it back, he\u2019d more than likely have to be an AH asking a grieving widow to give up the ring of his dead wife on their wedding day because even if they were well intentioned, death causes a lot of mayhem and things get lost or forgotten about, and no one wants to be in that situation.

Could this all be a lie by your father and stepmother to get it from you? A ring your father probably felt he was entitled to as your mother's husband? \n\nIf I were you, I'd be asking uncle some questions. Like, has my dad ever tried to get the ring from him before?", "NTA. At all.\n\n1. You are not close with Evelyn, at all, as evidenced by the fact that the request for the ring went Evelyn > her mom > your dad > you. As per your comments, you haven't even spoken to her in close to a year. Sure, it sucks that she's dying, but her being terminal doesn't change your relationship dynamics.\n2. The only thing she cares about is that the ring is \"pretty.\" So your offer of giving her photos that would allow her to replicate it is perfectly fair. There is no reason that she has to have that ring, other than the fact that her fiance and family are clearly cheap and want to avoid paying for a new ring when they can have one for free. Why spend money on a dead girl, right?\n3. Bold of them to try and emotionally blackmail you by pretending she's your sister, despite the fact that you have almost no relationship, and even more bold by proclaiming it a \"family\" ring, despite the fact that Evelyn had nothing to do with your mom and literally never even met her.\n4. \"That he thought showing the girls that was a nice bonding moment when they were young.\" That's bullshit. You know what really happened, right?  Your dad, vastly overstepping his boundaries, took it upon himself to promise Evelyn that she would get the ring when she got engaged.\n5. The above point might very well be the reason your dad was never given the ring. Your mom knew him well, enough to know that she could not trust him to fulfil her wishes, and that's why she entrusted the ring to her brother instead of her husband, even though that would seemingly be the more natural thing to do.\n6. \"She even had Evelyn write a letter for me to read saying how much she'd love to wear it and get married wearing it.\" Why? Ask them that simple question. Considering she has absolutely no connection to that ring whatsoever, why does it mean anything to her to wear that ring, as opposed to get one made just like it?\n7. \"I am getting shit from the three of them (dad, his wife, Evelyn's fiance).\" Considering that you barely have a relationship with Evelyn, you sure as shit don't have one with her fiance. Tell him to stop being a cheapskate and buy a new ring and stop bothering you. Then block him everywhere. I'm guessing you don't have much of a relationship with your dad's wife, either? Then same goes for her. The only person that you have a relationship with is your dad, but he doesn't exactly sound like Father of the Year material to me, so just stick to your guns. Neither he, nor his wife, nor Evelyn have any claim to the ring.\n8. Oh, and the part about you getting the ring back when she's gone? Not gonna happen. Here's what *will* happen: when she eventually passes, her fiance and/or her mom will get emotional about the ring, say how they can't bring themselves to part with it just yet, this was the ring Evelyn wore to her wedding and she loved it *so much*. Can you maybe just give them a bit more time? And later, sister Amy is going to come out of the woodworks and lay on the emotion, and talk about how she always dreamt about getting the ring herself when she gets married. It will be like carrying a piece of her sister with her always! Can't you *see* how important that is to her? *Do you not have a heart?*", "INFO I think your mom's ring is pretty, too.

In her last moments she did not trust your father not to do wrong by you but she hoped she would be wrong, and not only is HE letting her worst fear come true, he doesn\u2019t even respect his late wife enough to even consider how she might\u2019ve felt and realized that THIS WAS THE EXACT REASON HE HASN\u2019T BEEN CUSTODIAN OF THE RING FOR THE LAST DECADE OR MORE.***", "It\u2019s not Evelyn\u2019s ring.\n\nIt\u2019s not her fianc\u00e9\u2019s ring.\n\nIt\u2019s not your dad\u2019s wife\u2019s ring.\n\nIt\u2019s not your dad\u2019s ring.\n\nAnd if you give in and let her have it, it\u2019s no longer your ring. You will never get it back.  Someone on that side of the family will keep it either for sentimental reasons or out of spite.  Do not cave.  Make sure your uncle clearly understands your intent.  You are NTA here.  A whole group of people just unilaterally decided your property should go to them, without ever consulting you first.  Do not let them burden you with guilt.  Just remember that if you do give in, you lose that ring permanently.  It means nothing to any of them until it\u2019s on Evelyn\u2019s finger, and then it\u2019s *her* ring.  Stay strong.", "> Unless there's a solid contract or will stating it, the soon-to-be husband would most likely become the owner. It's a very valid concern that he'd keep it. Not to mention, it could just end up damaged or lost.\n\nEven with a contract I'd be very concerned OP's stepsister would be buried with the ring, in which case you aren't getting that back unless a court orders a body exhumed to get it, which doesn't seem likely. And even with insurance or a court settlement, cash isn't going to replace the sentimental value of the ring.", "> There's no reason to insist on the original ring.\n\nThere is. Stepmom wants it. If OP gives in, he'll never get the ring back.", "Honestly, I wouldn't do it even with a contract. They'll try to renege, hoping that OP will think it's not worth the hassle.\n\nIf he thinks it's worth the hassle to sue, they won't stop badgering him to withdraw the suit. Because FAMILYYYYYY.\n\nIf he persists, he might still lose the case.\n\nIf he wins the case, he'll never hear the end of if.\n\nIt's really not worth it.", "NTA, technically it was your moms dying wish for you to have it, so you can pass it on to your daughter or your wife. Are they saying that your mom\u2019s dying wish doesn\u2019t matter?  Or your step sisters dying wish should be more important to you than the promise you made your mother when she was still alive? Should you not respect your mothers wishes? (These are just examples you can say to them to counter their claims on the ring- your mom only wanted your wife or daughter to have it)\n\nAlso, don\u2019t let them gaslight you. You won\u2019t be able to claim the ownership. She may want to be buried with the ring as her last wish or pass it on to his sister.", "Your mother's ring isn't a \"family ring\", it's your mother's ring that she specifically intended for your future fiance.  I hope you've written to your uncle to remind him to keep it safe for you, not your father or stepsister. \nSeriously,  why doesn't your stepmom give her own daughter her wedding ring?  She should have at least one.  Is that somehow not a \"family ring\"?  She'll get it back in a few months, right?  NTA.", "I think they will bury her with it or sell it.", "Get it appraised and insured.  They're going to try to take it and will never return it.  They'll likely sell it for the cash.  \n\nOP would never see that ring again (or the money they make from it).", "I know a few people who so far have lived beyond the 5 year mark after receiving a stage 4 prognosis. Cancer is just constantly being maintained.", "Well, they pretty much have already ruined it for the OP. The sight of it will probably trigger them every time they see it now...if he doesn't go NC with them. Save it for the next generation and hope they don't ruin it. NTA", "Yup. My dad had a terminal illness with a survival duration of 2 years. He made it to 4 years before an unrelated issue got him.", "You need to have a one/one discussion with your father, away from his wife and girls.   You need to get all your feelings on the table about how he prioritized them over you, consciously bonding with them while leaving you behind.   Tell him the ring is one thing he will not be taking from you to make them happy.\n\nTell your uncle you want it now so you can put it in a safety deposit box for protection.", "That is nauseating, and at this point I'm genuinely wondering why you are even still on speaking terms with him. He seems hellbent on making it clear that you and your mother's memory exist for him only as instruments for further his relationship with his stepdaughter. His seeming lack of empathy here for your loss, and your emotional connection to an heirloom given to you by a deceased parent is wrenching. He seems remarkably comfortable with throwing your feelings under the bus if it will bring him closer to her. I dunno what's up with that, but it's worrying that he doesn't seem to care about his own child's feelings anywhere near as much as his stepchild's, and that this disparity seemingly goes back to well before cancer was a rationale for it.", "It's a ring, OP\u2026 she can borrow one of her own mother's rings. \n\nI'm guessing the drama is because the ring has a higher value than what her fianc\u00e9 or parents can afford, but even if it doesn\u2019t, it has value to you, so keep it safe. If they change their minds about the replica, make sure you are the one who brings it to the jeweller, and if it has to stay there, make it very clear that you\u2019re the only one who is authorized to retrieve it. I'd also have it separately appraised by a different jeweller beforehand and let the jeweller know that you\u2019ve had it appraised, so everyone knows that changes to the ring will be noticed. \n\nI lost my dad in my 20s, and my mom passed his ring to my brother. There was comfort in that ring, the warm metal that had been on his hand, and I like seeing it on his finger. I hope you find someone wonderful to give it to someday.", "Honestly, it doesn't take THAT long. As someone who got their ring customized at a jeweler. Our jeweler got it done in 4 weeks (and he said it was \"longer\" than usual - since he was bombard by Valentine's requests).\n\nYes, she may be terminally ill, but there's options. Could just buy a beautiful one off the shelf. There's TONS out there.", "My father got a stage 4 diagnosis a few years ago and he\u2019s still around as chemo kicked the cancer\u2019s ass.", "I thought the same thing.", "It\u2019s\u2026 precious to him", "This. That\u2019s what we did. I wanted a ring similar to my grandma\u2019s but she was still wearing hers, so my now husband got one at an estate sale. It\u2019s a beautiful art deco piece that I love. And he was able to get it less expensively than making one or buying a newer reproduction piece. Win win for all involved.", "All too common. I had a parent stipulate in the divorce that certain things were to come to me. The other parent gave them away to their 'new' family over time, quietly, continuously telling me that they were in storage. I am not pleased, even though these things had only sentimental value.", "I'm a bit curious to know who gets my Mom's rings and stuff like that.\n\nOr who got it.\n\nMom died a year ago, nothings been said about it.   Mind you, Dad is still alive, so, it's all still in his hands.\n\nPersonally, I'm not worried about it - makes sense for my sisters to get them, and, there's only one grand daughter.  Being the only son, it's only a curiousity thing for me, I don't have a \"claim\" or need for those items.\n\nDad's Snap On tool chest, that I better get first dibs on.   Put in a lot of time not finding the right tool with that thing, I deserve it!", "To be honest, I think the fundraiser is making them feel even more entitled to freebies since strangers are financially contributing to the act of love for a dying young woman, especially seeing as it's cancer and people are helping to fulfill a dying wish that most people would appreciate or commennd. So, they have now got an expectation that probably everyone would need to do something and there expectation from you is the ring, as they can physically see what you have to offer in their minds as they know you and have probably envied a custom ring being made for your mum, which is likely expensive as well. \n\nI would not recommend giving her the ring at all. I've seen some of your comments and agree so much that it'll be hard to get back the ring from a widower or childless mother and even if you did, which I doubt you would, they'd be reminded of her if ever they saw it again. The memory of your mum would be removed from the ring and it'll most definitely be about your dying sister as it seems she's already romanticised your mum's ring via your dad unfortunately. \n\nTell your uncle about everything and make sure he doesn't give it up or get duped into doing so. \nBest of luck", "Maybe they should use her mother's (OP's step mom's) engagement ring then. Mom can go without her engagement ring for a few months to provide that experience to her daughter.", "My husband had no ring, lol. It was sappy and spur of the moment \ud83d\ude02", "My husband proposed without a ring in hand. We were on an extended overseas trip at the time (to a place where it would be inadvisable to carry expensive jewelry), and he had ordered the ring and had it shipped to his parents house, intending to propose once we were home. \n\nOne night over dinner he just blurted out the question though, lol. When I was younger I was unimpressed with the lack of romance (no ring!? we weren't even dressed nicely or anything!) But as I've gotten older I've changed my mind and find it pretty romantic after all.", "A lot of ppl talk about getting married and then go pick out a ring together. Like me. And my parents. Not everyone cares about proposals and weddings. Some ppl would just like to be married.", "It probably wasn't recently. Maybe as a little girl his stepmum planted the thought in her head and kept mentioning it. \n\nIt's weird to us because we've been taught respect, unfortunately not everyone has and I've come across more people who aren't taught to be respectful.", "Why would someone want another family's actual heirloom?\n\nI can see liking the style, but in that case pictures of the ring for a jeweler would be more than enough.  But do they do this to random people on the street - \"your ring is so pretty.  it's exactly what I want.  give it to me!\"\n\nWhat is wrong with these people?", "It wasn't the first wife's ring. First wife's mother bought it for her daughter's son(OP).", ">More likely, they want this young lady to have had the experience of being married before she dies.\n\nAnd her boyfriend can have the experience of being left with her medical debt. The sentiment is nice, but really they should not have a legal wedding, especially if OP's step-sister is still covered under her parent's insurance.", "Nah, his uncle has had that ring since his mother died.  She gave it to him to keep it safe for her son.  Wise woman.", "I agree.  Absolutely no respect has been paid to this young man and the gift his mother entrusted for him.  Instead, the people that are supposed to ensure that he knows he still counts, descend on him to take what little he has of his mom away.  And try to make him feel guilty for doing the _right_ thing.\n\nThis should have been stopped immediately the first time it came up.  \"I'm sorry, that was a gift from his dying mother to her son.  It was entrusted to and for your brother when he gets married or has children.  It is not an option for your ring.\"\n\nTo actually pile on and encourage this attempt at moral extortion is such a betrayal of that young man's feelings of individual worth.  \n\nAnd to say that it would be temporary is just the worst sort of full on bs.  There is no outcome where the ring will ever be \"his\" again.  Even returned it will be about loss and not the heirloom that was supposed to be a witness from his mother as he starts his life.  Because there is a massive difference between a gift to start your life from a parent that left too soon; and the returned (if even) ring of a step sister that was taken too soon and wanted your ring for her own.  There is nothing joyous left in the later.  Just loss.\n\nBut I guess his remaining parent can't figure out that he has to do good by the living as well as those that may leave too soon.", "It was totally an engagement ring. OP commented that dad didn't know what mom would like in a ring so he proposed and said she could pick out her own ring. Grandma then stepped in and offered to pay for a custom ring.", "Wrong! It was elevensies!"]}
