Do you talk to her regularly? Clear the air, and just say that it's your mom's ring and very important to you. She could have something from *her* mother, or her fiance's family, or just get married as planned. Did her fiance not give her a ring? Why?\n\nNTA at all.

It's sad that she's dying. But the truth is that she wants the ring because it's pretty, and it means more than aesthetics to you. Your dad and his wife want you to give it up because they're sad they are going to lose someone they love and they want to make as many connections as possible before she's gone forever. \n\nReality is, as you are well aware, engagement rings have so much emotion attached to them. The truth is that it isn't just a few months. For you, it is your mom's ring and important because it was hers. If Evelyn ever wears it then, for her family (including your dad), it will be thought of as *her* ring. What if her fianc\u00e9 gets attached and doesn't want to give it back? What if you use it in the future and your family goes on about \"Evelyn's\" ring? What will your fianc\u00e9 think of the family potentially resenting them for wearing a ring they no longer associate with you and your mother?

Evelyn has no relation to your mom so nobody should be asking for it for Evelyn. I think you offered a nice solution to give them some photos to replicate it if they wanted to.

Why would showing your mothers rings photos would be a bonding experience for your father and your step siblings? It is just bizarre.

And if she doesn't, you are asking a greiving husband to return her wifes wedding ring. \n\nI think replicating the ring or getting a new one are the sensible options here.

I truly feel sorry for her. NTA. \n\nDid you talk to your uncle that she wants the ring?", "NTA. \nFirst of all, your mother wasn't her family. She has no emotional tie to that ring; she just wants it. \"I want it\" is not a good reason for you to hand over an heirloom specifically left for you.\n\nSecondly, if you did let her use it for whatever time she has left, there's absolutely no guarantee your stepmother wouldn't turn the tables and demand she be buried with 'her' engagement ring.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 should buy her one specifically for *her*, as opposed to allowing her to beg for something she has no right to. She deserves a ring that's meant for her, not a borrowed ring she'll have to part with when she meets her end. She's dying, the LEAST they could all do is get her something she can symbolically take with her.\n\nAnd yes I know she can't take the actual ring with her when she dies, but prying the jewellery off her fingers after death is leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth and frankly her parents and fianc\u00e9 should want more for her. Shame on them.", "NTA\n\nThe ring has a lot of sentimental value to YOU, not her and there\u2019s a slight chance you might not be able to get it back due to one reason or the other.

It sucks that they put all this pressure on you.", "NTA I get the impression they don\u2019t want to spend the money for a ring because she is dying\u2026\u2026..not your problem her bf needs to stop being cheap. If he wants to get married then he can buy her a ring himself or the girls mother can give up her engagement ring while her daughter is still alive.

You've been reasonable to offer them pictures to make a copy. She can then be buried with it, which she wouldn't be able to do with yours.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. \n\nThe ring was kept for you, your mom even went out of her way to give it to her family to avoid your dad doing something with it. \n\nYour dad should understand how connected you feel for this, the fact he expects you to give it to her when she has 0 connection to your mom is bizarre to me. Guilting you makes me feel as if he\u2019s not looking for out for you, just your step sister. \n\nNTA, keep your family ring because I\u2019m with most others that you won\u2019t get that back for one reason or another.", "NTA. What was your father even thinking, showing her your mother\u2019s ring? If you did lend it to her, her husband would want to keep it. Lock it up in a safe deposit box at a bank your father has no connection to.", "NTA. \n\nWhen something like this happens, it\u2019s almost more likely that you\u2019d never get it back.

Someone with whom you have a **biological** connection. If Evelyn was your sister by blood, it *might* be a different story. But as it is, she\u2019s the child of a woman your dad married. No biological relation to you at all. Your mom wanted to keep the ring in the family, hence she gave it to you. \n\nThe cynical part of me wonders if your mother thought about your father moving on when she bequeathed it to you instead of him. Like maybe she couldn\u2019t trust that he wouldn\u2019t put it on someone else\u2019s finger one day. Like I said, cynical of me, but not completely unheard of. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about Evelyn\u2019s circumstances, but I don\u2019t think you should have to worry about \u201cloaning\u201d them something that belongs rightfully to you.

Ask your stepsister why her wishes as a dying woman matter more than your own mother's wishes, which she made known when she was dying.

If nothing else, tell the boyfriend the longer he waits to actually BUY a ring, the less chance she'll have to wear it.", "Easily NTA. Evelyn has zero connection to the ring. It's an heirloom within your family, gifted to you, to do what you like with.\n\nI, for one, would probably allow a dying girl that I knew to wear it for a few months before she passed, but that's just me. If I didn't know her well, or didn't like her, or had some strong connection to the ring(I'm not a sentimental type), I might not. But you're not me. Your values are your own and should be respected. If she and your mom were biologically related, that might muddy the waters a bit, but that's not the case.\n\nSeems like a pretty open-and-shut case in the Court of Reddit Sphinctery.", "NTA it\u2019s BS that they even thought that could be a thing.", "She's dying and the first thing she and the three horrible pawns think of is to steal from you? \n\nNTA and please stay away from those people as much as you can.", "NTA: there's a reason your mother gave it to your uncle and not your father.", "NTA\n\nDo not give them that ring.

It's terrible that she is terminally ill. It's always tragic when someone so young has such a horrible diagnosis. But that has nothing to do with the fact that your mother's ring belongs to you. It's a shame they are weaponizing Evelyn's illness to try and shame you into giving up your mother's ring. And that's what would happen. No matter what anyone says, I doubt you would get it back.

He doesn\u2019t currently have a close relationship with his sister and most people wouldn\u2019t be looking to start one based off entitlement to a previous heirloom. The ring can spread joy for op and their future family and doesn\u2019t need to do anything in general if op doesn\u2019t want to. Many people never touch heirlooms or keep them locked away and they are not selfish nor wrong for not wanting to risk something they find precious and dear to themselves. Not only that, as op has mentioned even if they did give it back, he\u2019d more than likely have to be an AH asking a grieving widow to give up the ring of his dead wife on their wedding day because even if they were well intentioned, death causes a lot of mayhem and things get lost or forgotten about, and no one wants to be in that situation.
