So your setup is actually outside of what I would consider the norm. \n\nIMO the solution is very simple. Your bathroom gets downgraded from \u201cyour bathroom\u201d to \u201cthe bathroom that mostly you use but also guests\u201d and your share of the rent is decreased accordingly. Your roommate pays more because she has a private en suite and she doesn\u2019t have to let guests into her bedroom. \n\nIf you would rather keep a bathroom entirely to yourself, then swap rooms so you have the private en suite and your roommate has the hallway one.

You don't need a reason to not let random people use your own privately rented room for whatever purpose they have in mind, whether it be to piss on your bathroom floor or leave their dander in your bed. period", "NTA, I'm sure she would be equally upset if you had your guests use hers!", "NTA. It's your bathroom. She wants her guests to use yours because she doesn't trust them walking into her bedroom. And if she doesn't trust them walking into her bedroom then how close of friends are they? If I had a bathroom in my bedroom any of my guests could use it because I don't let people I don't trust in my house.", "Oh man. Time to install a bathroom door knob with a lock and key (yes, I\u2019m petty)", "It doesn't matter if you don't see the issue because you aren't paying rent for the room. If someone is paying rent for a room they don't need to have a reason why they will not let someone else have access to it. Guests are capable of understanding a simple instruction about which bathroom to use, they aren't animals that just do whatever comes natural. If it's not an issue for them to use the hall bathroom then it's not an issue for them to use their host's bathroom either.", "it also doesnt change the fact that its his bathroom?\n\nIf he left a belonging (say, mobile phone)in the 'common area' is it now common property or still his property? What about belongings such as food and things in the common kitchen?", "if this was what happened, you could try posting a polite sign in the door to your bathroom.", "Maybe get one that unlocks with your phone?", "I mean if the toilet was locked someone could just piss in the sink", "It doesn't even have to match. He can replace the doorknob with a lock, save the original, and then put it back when he moves out. It's like a $20 investment.", "Yuck - you're right.  Being a woman I didn't think of that.  \n\nNow that you mention it, though, I did see a video online of a drunken woman breaking a sink off the wall in a pub restroom when she sat in it to pee.\n\nI think that most of us who responded feel that the situation was unfair to OP.  She needs to lock that door with something that can't be opened with a hairpin or screwdriver.  Amazon has some interesting security measures that are not expensive, like this:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Prime-Line-4180-Door-Lock-Out-Device/dp/B00BOZBDK6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HGJR844MLGI4&keywords=locks+for+door+eviction&qid=1684984190&sprefix=eviction+lock%2Caps%2C121&sr=8-1", "I find it such a bizarre thing to be worried about. The thing with the hair on the toilet makes me wonder if there's something else going on with op", "It wouldn't be like that because you are invited into the house by the same people who provide you the bathroom to use, and also because the guests here would not be told to leave to go to the bathroom, just which bathroom to use.", "Maybe OP\u2019s roommate\u2019s guests, who OP doesn\u2019t know, can use your bathroom next time then, since it\u2019s no big deal to let strangers use your bathroom.", "Yes. If she gets 1.5 baths and he gets .5 baths, he shouldn\u2019t be paying the same rent.", "I can guarantee that no one with ADHD meds and any sense keeps them in a shared bathroom!", "I'm not mad but I guess the So? sounded a bit snotty. On this sub sometimes we're all  like *What?* Are you crazy? How are you people thinking like this? Lol", "Yeah, but it looks better if you match it, because then it will usually match all the other doorknobs in the unit. :) it's more of aesthetics than anything.", "They could do that but if I was rhe roommate and saw that I'd personally start looking for a new place but that's probably because I don't like living with people I'm not friends with", "Why? She has access to two bathrooms and he only has access to one. She has privacy, he does not. Cases like that usually mean a difference in rent.", "I think that your idea is best.  There is a comment somewhere above us in which the victim told the leasing office and was allowed to leave. \n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if the room mate has done this before, either.  Some people are just super entitled.", "I wouldn't want to clean up after her guests", "I wouldn\u2019t either of we were just roommates. If they were friends outside of this, then I fail to see a real issue here.", "Then they aren\u2019t friends but are acquaintances. Friends shouldn\u2019t care if friends see their rooms.", "NTA!! Put a lock on that bathroom!", "NTA I had a friend with the same living situation and she asked me to use her bathroom with was attached to her bedroom", "Nta next time lock it", "Don't be daft.", "Nta. Maybe get a lock for the bathroom that only you have a key to?", "Next time place twisted up ketchup packets underneath the seat. NTA", "NTA but it\u2019s a little awkward and generally the bathroom in the hall would be used by guests.", "Lol, the old hair on the toilet seat trick. I mean, is that really conclusive proof? NTA but also not much of a sleuth.", "Here\u2019s the thing, while I agree, it is Op\u2019s bathroom and he told his roommate no.\n\nAfter that, the roommate it the AH for being unable to accept an answer to a question she asked.\n\nThat\u2019s the issue regardless of what is \u201cnormal\u201d to me and you", "Except OP isnt hosting them.  He wasn\u2019t even home. He didnt invite them. And its HIS bathroom. Maybe he has stuff in there he doesnt want to strangers to see or steal like medications. Maybe the bathrooms messy and he didnt have time to clean it. Roommate has a perfectly good bathroom thats not unreasonably far away for her quests to use. She has chosen to invite people into the home, so she\u2019s responsible for looking after them while they\u2019re there. \n\nMy roommate and I have the same set up. Her guests use her bathroom. My quests use mine. Mutual guests (from our shared friend group) use mine because its off the living room.\n\nShes the one who is straining the relationship. She asked his permission, he said no. She didn\u2019t respect the boundary he set. He would only be TA if her bathroom was out of use (eg plumbing issues) and he still didn\u2019t let guests use his bathroom.", "Toilet paper represents at least a half an hour of my current wage so there is that. Also: he pays to have a private bathroom and that's clearly their arrangement. If roommate wants visitors she can risk getting their boy cooties in hers.", "Did you pay less for sharing your bathroom? For needing to clean for other people?  To pull out your meds and get things ready?  \n\n\nIf not, you were being taken advantage of.", "I was in the same housing setup. I was in the master bedroom with the ensuite bathroom. The hallway bathrooms were essentially communal but mostly used by my roommate. \n\nYes I did pay more since I had more exclusive access to the house.\n\nI just don't see this arrangement working out for OP if these issues weren't discussed beforehand.", "He calls her a roommate and not a friend. He pays for the sole use of his bathroom.   The roommate said she was having male \"guests.\"   Who knows how many people have splattered urine on the floor or sides of the tank?  Set their a$$ on his seat?   Or used his soap, or his hand towel?  Maybe he's a bit of a germaphobe, and someone using his bathroom is too much.  Maybe he keeps medication in the medicine cabinet. Maybe he doesn't want strangers rummaging through his medicine cabinet. \n\nNTA.", "Good for you.\n\nAt least that way the only people that might try and take them from you are customs and TSA.", "It depends on what your living arrangement is like. For me and virtually all of my friends, failing to share a bathroom with guests (within reason) would be deeply weird. We're friends that lived together and that came with some flexibility.\n\nBut if your relationship with your roommate is purely transactional, it makes sense. But I wouldn't choose to live in that kind of situation. My college era girlfriend lived in an apartment like that and it was hellish. Everyone had their own set of cookware, eatingware, etc. There were four sets of soy sauce, four things of ketchup, etc.\n\nLife is too short to bicker about trivialities. If you want to have a strictly split lifestyle, be sure that future housemates are on the same page.", "NTA.\n\nSee if your landlord will allow you to install a lock on it.\n\nShe probably didn\u2019t want them going through her room to the bathroom - fair enough, but as you said no, she should have either sucked it up, or not invited her guests over.", "NTA this has always been my devision when renting too. I have a bathroom, you have a bathroom. Your guests use yours, mine use mine. Regardless of where it is located, it is an extension of your bedroom/private space.\n\nWould she ask if her guests can nap on your bed? No.", "NTA. I suggest you to find a new apartment. She clearly doesn't respect you and your space.", "NTA.\nWhen she goes out next time, go in and lift the seat and leave it up (you don't even have to use it).....\nWhen she freaks out, say hey, I thought this was a thing we do now.", "NTA", "NTA. She is having guests over. They can use her bathroom. You shouldn\u2019t have to give up yours to accommodate her when you both pay rent.", "NTA \n\nStart locking your bathroom.", "I agree, Im surprised I am not seeing more responses like this", "It\u2019s her guests he don\u2019t know. So yes they can trek through her bedroom.", "Could the hair have blown away on its own?", "If his bathroom were in his room and hers was in the hallway, then I\u2019d say she absolutely directed said person to his bathroom cuz it\u2019s out of the way. But with his bathroom being the one in the hallway, not everyone asks if they can use it, especially if the door is left open so you KNOW it\u2019s a bathroom. If the door was closed then less likely because people aren\u2019t likely to be opening closed doors", "To add to some other points, because I don\u2019t think this is common but I\u2019ve had it once, the bathroom could be double door\u2019d where one leads to his bedroom and the other to the hall. That can make it feel more weird to have people you don\u2019t know using it."]}
