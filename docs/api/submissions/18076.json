Good detective work by the way.", "NTA. \n\nDid you close the bathroom door before you left so the friends wouldn't see that there was a bathroom there to use? If the door was left open, I can see where some confusion and accidental usage could happen.", "NTA, if there is \"her bathroom and your bathroom\" then they should use her bathroom.

On one hand you and your room mate established that it's your bathroom.

Her guests should use her bathroom. I lived in a similar situation and we agreed if a gust of mine was using my bathroom and I needed to go I could use his and Vice versa. It is a boundary and should not be a big deal to you room mate.", "NTA. I had the same situation with one of my college roommates. He got the bedroom with the walk in closet, private bathroom, AND the parking spot (we were in downtown Chicago so it mattered). When I told him the bathroom in the hallway was mine and mine alone, he told me no and basically stopped listening to me whenever I brought it up. He also let his brother sleep in my bed multiple times when I was away at home for breaks and didn't bother to tell me until I outright asked him because my pillows were messed up and they smelled weird.\n\nAll that to say, your roommate is on a power trip. Unless she pays more rent for two bathrooms, the guests can go through her bedroom to use hers. If she didn't want people walking through her private room to use the restroom, she should have picked the option with the detached bathroom. She's trying to have her cake and eat it too. If she's worried about her dude friends pissing on her toilet seat, she can either ask them to sit down or put up with cleaning up after them.\n\nIf she does it again, let your guests use her bathroom since it's all the same, right? /s", "NTA and you need to start locking your bathroom.", "YTA and a petty one at that, playing around with hairs to trap people.\n\nI've seen similar queries on reddit and I just don't get it. I don't know why people are so proprietary about their bathrooms. I try and draw on my own experience when answering these questions, but I have never been in a situation where I have been told a bathroom is \"off limits\" to guests for whatever reason.\n\nI just don't get it. A bathroom's a bathroom. When you visit someone, people generally use the one closest to them. In your case, it would be the one in the hall. When one bathroom is occupied, I'd go looking for another. I think that's just to be expected.\n\nWhy not make an arrangement where if there are guests that use your bathroom, your roommate cleans it the next day.", "Yta\n\nHers is through her room.

But I would consider putting a lock on your bathroom, if you can. Because this is likely going to happen the next time roommate has guests. Your bathroom is in the hallway and unless she informs guests they need to use hers, they will continue to use yours. And it will not be their fault since the hallway bathroom is usually the one guests use.", "NTA\n\nIf her guests are using your bathroom, she should be cleaning it.", "Get a lock with a key and lock it when your not home that\u2019s totally unacceptable behavior NTA", "INFO: how is the rent split up? \n\nIt\u2019s pretty reasonable for the bathroom that\u2019s in a common hallway to also be the bathroom that guests use. Every apartment I\u2019ve ever lived in, the only bathrooms that were \u201conly\u201d for a specific occupant were the ones attached to bedrooms; any bathrooms accessible from the common areas of the home were maybe primarily used by other housemates, but also available for guests. So your setup is actually outside of what I would consider the norm. \n\nIMO the solution is very simple. Your bathroom gets downgraded from \u201cyour bathroom\u201d to \u201cthe bathroom that mostly you use but also guests\u201d and your share of the rent is decreased accordingly. Your roommate pays more because she has a private en suite and she doesn\u2019t have to let guests into her bedroom. \n\nIf you would rather keep a bathroom entirely to yourself, then swap rooms so you have the private en suite and your roommate has the hallway one. But in either case, whoever has the en suite should pay more rent.", "I didn't k ow that these stories were repeating.

Though I could never quite decide if the book version or the movie version was more brutal. Probably the book. (Misery.)", "If that is the case the other roommate should be paying extra for having access to two bathroom, one which is private only for her.  In this both of them pay for their own bathroom and room. So only they should have access to their allocated rooms. Otherwise how is that fair to OP?", "Why couldn't they just use her bathroom as he asked? Like you said, a bathroom is just a bathroom.", "Doesn't matter.  Hers is hers and his is his. Location is irrelevant.", "OP says his roommate asked if her male friends could use his bathroom. If she's not comfortable with certain friends using her bathroom, then he shouldn't have to be comfortable with any of her friends using his.", "I agree with I\\_am\\_legendary. I think it's very weird to have these kind of restrictions on a bathroom.", "Think of it this way, how is it when the living arrangements were made did you not think the guest bathroom that you view as yours wasn't going to be used by guest? I get what your saying about her asking and you saying no, then it was used. Why would you think you're the asshole when she asked and then ignored the answer? I'm asking how this never came up before? Does the roommate pay more for her room considering it has a bathroom? Who is the lease holder or the first one there. I dont care much for how much money you make or why you moved in just wondering how this wasnt thought of before?", "It\u2019s not the main one tho.

The one here isn\u2019t typical, so it does warrant a little different thinking.\n\nEither way, with the way things are set up in their shared living situation, OP is NTA.

She allowed to be uncomfortable and not let her friends use her bathroom, but he's also allowed to feel the same way about his spaces.

What's wrong w/having an opposite sex person walk thru yr bedroom? Like the proprietary bathroom feelings, I just don't get it. As a guest, you don't linger in another person's bedroom.
