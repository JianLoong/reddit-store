So your setup is actually outside of what I would consider the norm. \n\nIMO the solution is very simple. Your bathroom gets downgraded from \u201cyour bathroom\u201d to \u201cthe bathroom that mostly you use but also guests\u201d and your share of the rent is decreased accordingly. Your roommate pays more because she has a private en suite and she doesn\u2019t have to let guests into her bedroom. \n\nIf you would rather keep a bathroom entirely to yourself, then swap rooms so you have the private en suite and your roommate has the hallway one.

ESH\n\nRoommate asked, and should have been ready for a no. Roommate also could have offered to clean it before or after, contribute to essentials, or literally anything other than asking if a clear \u201cno\u201d response was a joke. \n\nOP has the hallway bathroom, if they didn\u2019t want guests using that it needed to be stated from the beginning. As a guest in someone\u2019s home, if I see a potty and I need to go I\u2019m prob just gonna go rather than ask- afterall, I know this person we\u2019ll enough to be INSIDE their home for long enough to need to pee FFS. \n\nOP also might have a tendency to joke so a one word \u201cno\u201d could have come off as a joke? OP also could have asked for whatever was needed to make their No a Yes. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of situational awareness missing from both OP and roommate.", "Ah yes, my empathy via storytelling toward his situation by comparison is unnecessary conflation. Got it. Thank you, internet stranger.\n/s", "Roommates can decide whatever they want.\n\nThere is no rule that says it must be shared with his roommate's guest. OP is paying for the use of his own bathroom presumably.\n\nIn a private home with only two baths in which a family of related people live, a hall bath is used as a guest bath but that is because no one is paying for the exclusive use of the bath.", " My opinion is that he sucks for saying no in the first place. I don't care about their previous agreement. I've had this kind of apartment... he's being unreasonable for saying no. Some people need to live alone.", "that's fine.. As a guest it would absolutely be weird to be told, \"you'll have to go through my bedroom and use the bathroom there. The other one is my room mate's and he gets weird about people using his bathroom\"\n\nI'm kind of surprised the roommate thought to ask.. as it's just kind of assumed that hallway bathrooms are where guests go. I guess OP is allowed to deny the request... /shrug", "Yeah, it's pretty weird of her to restrict access to her bathroom for her guests and then feel entitled to tell OP that her guests will be using his washroom instead.\n\nSuper strange how she feels entitled to make those sort of unilateral decisions, even after being told no.", "You are not being polite if you cannot accept \u201cno\u201d for an answer.  It\u2019s his bathroom and if she wants to keep her bedroom private- don\u2019t have over guests", "I mean, my first apartment was a one bedroom with the bathroom off the bedroom, so it's not like I had a choice of where to send guests. That's essentially how we should consider her situation since the other bathroom is OP's. If I could deal with that, she can.", "This is a great insight / summary.", "We never keep meds in the bathroom-this is one reason why", "Do recommend one if you are using one...", "this is fucking fantastic, thank you so much", "Ah yes, the old rectal scanner.", "Or one of those doorknobs that require a fingerprint to open.", "Unless we know if roommate is paying more in rent for the master + private bathroom I don\u2019t think this is a fair assessment. \n\nMost people seem to be going off the assumption that rent is being split evenly, in which case I think it\u2019s fair that OP gets the hallway bathroom as their private bathroom.\n\nNow, if the roommate was paying more in rent and OP was contributing less, then I\u2019d say they don\u2019t have a leg to stand on.\n\nAlso, roommates friend used OPs bathroom despite clearly stating they were not okay with this. Roommate and their friends completely ignored OPs boundaries. OP is NTA. But roommate definitely is based on the information present.", "It is when you invited them over, if she doesn\u2019t want men to walk through her room to use her restroom she can just not invite them over.", "Temperature changes, and high humidity from showers/baths alone are a strong reason to not keep medication in the bathroom.", "As a woman it can be uncomfortable for men to go into your bedroom, even friends. \n\nThat being said the roommates established bath ownership and OP said no, so roomie should not have allowed guests to use his bathroom. It's possible tho that someone saw the bath in the common hallway and assumed it was shared use & not bother to ask roomie.", "Are you fucking serious?", "If you are a guest in a home and need to pee, and you see a bathroom in the hallway and your host is mid-conversation with someone else\u2026.. what do you do? Cause me..? I\u2019d go pee.", "> As a guest, you don't linger in another person's bedroom. But if yr just walking through to use the bathroom, what's the big deal?\n\nIt's pretty weird to pass a perfectly serviceable bathroom, walk through a private bed room, to get to another bathroom...\n\nLet me put it this way... We have 2.5 bathrooms in our house. A very nice shower in the bathroom attached to our bedroom. another normal tub/shower in the hallway bathroom. I've offered to let guests use our shower during overnight/long stays... oddly.. none have wanted to walk through my wife and my bedroom and use our private bathroom.\n\nOnce you explain the situation, \"we only have two bathrooms. That one isn't mine and my roommate doesn't like strangers in his bathroom\".. it gets a LITTLE bit more normal... but it's still weird from the guests' perspectives. (room mates are allowed to make weird agreements)", "Just asking out of curiosity. I\u2019ve never felt uncomfortable with male friends using my bathroom. Can you explain where the discomfort comes from?\nOP is NTA also.", "If I trust a man enough to have him in my home, I'll trust him enough to use my bathroom. \n\nI mean, I have a nice assortment of friends of all genders, and if I'm honest I'm mostly concerned about the girls. They could steal my makeup, or make-up brushes. Or use them (personal ick). My friend Dave isn't going to do that. He won't even take a pad, most times.", "Hell no I'm a woman, it's okay if you don't want men to see your bedroom, but it's also your choice to have those men over and pawn their bathroom use off onto your roommate who doesnt know them. Technically if she's not okay with them seeing her room she simply shouldnt be inviting them over, or she needs to make it clear there will be no restroom use while over. Guests should be asking where the bathroom is and not wandering around another persons home and entering rooms they think may be a communal bathroom. Its also really rude/potentially dangerous to lie about if OP is immune compromised and would be disinfecting surfaces anytime his bathroom is used by another person. I 100% think his roommate is acting spoiled/entitled af and needs to be sat down and have it explained to her that HER guests are HER responsibility and need to use HER bathroom. OP get a lock and key for your private bathroom that you pay for, it should always be up to you if someone is allowed to use it, youre not overreacting not the asshole, the \"Is this for real?\" was the first indication that she doesnt give a rats ass about your boundaries or you being comfortable in your own home. And she's gaslighting you. Use her bathroom, hell invite women over to use her bathroom, see if it goes both ways considering the roommate agreement seems pretty flexible in her mind.", "I would politely interrupt to ask where the bathroom is and if I may use it like a normal person.\n\nIdk why you\u2019re asking me this, because what I would do is entirely irrelevant to this discussion."]}
