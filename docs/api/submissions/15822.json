When we found out we are having a girl, she started crying tears of joy and was more excited than all of us combined and it truly was heartwarming.

Every time we went to check on her she would basically push us out the door. \n\nWell she came out later that night with her tablet in tow and demanded full attention (valley girl type- super fun and hilarious). She then proceeds to name off a bunch of names that she thinks we should name the baby. Now, we have absolutely no clue what we are going to name our baby so at first we were very receptive to her suggestions but soon realized that this is just not exactly helpful. Where we live, we have a lot of refugees and my step daughter has befriended all of them. We have play dates with the families and all of them are great BUT their names are very, very hard to pronounce. All of her suggestions except one were the names of her friends (the other name she suggested was one of my husband's cousins name). Names that not only can we not pronounce but also kind of cultural names passed down through the generations of her friends family. We told her we wouldn't be using a cultural name or generational name of her friends family and she looked upset at first but then just went back to her room to do more brainstorming, I'm assuming.\n\nThen yesterday she comes out with a list and once again, it's more names that we can not pronounce or names from kids at her school that she's not exactly friends with but still fall in to the criteria of (what I would assume to be) cultural names of other refugee kids. Some of them are beautiful names, don't get me wrong. But it just doesn't fit with us personally and not only that, but I'm not looking to offend anyone by using a name that isn't for us (not sure how else to word that). So we told her again, we would not be using these types of names. She got kind of angry, which was surprising, and said that we were judging her friends names \"because we are white\".

That could be a fun little bonding activity, maybe you could look through a baby name list and talk about which ones you like. Obviously, you do not have to name the baby any of the names she\u2019 picks out- but it would be an easy way to make her feel involved in the process to talk about names with her.

In the end we told her that while the name was awesome, we had other ideas. Maybe you and your husband can come up with some ideas and see if she likes them? Maybe have a list and she can pick a few that she likes best.", "NAH\n\nShe\u2019s just being a kid. You still have like 19 weeks for her to lose interest in her current name list. If you want her to feel involved in the naming process then you should make your own list and ask for her opinions on the pre-approved names. Also maybe find another baby-centered activity that will make her feel like she\u2019s contributing and like she matters. 10 is a great age for crafts! Like knitting, writing stories and making baby books, making toys or making artwork for the baby\u2019s walls.

Mum was like \"keep looking for other names\".

It could also be a moment to teach step daughter about their cultural history and names that aren\u2019t frequently used any more.
