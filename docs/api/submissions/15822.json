We just found out we are having a girl and my step daughter (10) is beyond excited at the news (we have 4 boys combined and she desperately wanted a sister). When we found out we are having a girl, she started crying tears of joy and was more excited than all of us combined and it truly was heartwarming. She then goes to her room and she's in there for like.. hours. Every time we went to check on her she would basically push us out the door. \n\nWell she came out later that night with her tablet in tow and demanded full attention (valley girl type- super fun and hilarious). She then proceeds to name off a bunch of names that she thinks we should name the baby. Now, we have absolutely no clue what we are going to name our baby so at first we were very receptive to her suggestions but soon realized that this is just not exactly helpful. Where we live, we have a lot of refugees and my step daughter has befriended all of them. We have play dates with the families and all of them are great BUT their names are very, very hard to pronounce. All of her suggestions except one were the names of her friends (the other name she suggested was one of my husband's cousins name). Names that not only can we not pronounce but also kind of cultural names passed down through the generations of her friends family. We told her we wouldn't be using a cultural name or generational name of her friends family and she looked upset at first but then just went back to her room to do more brainstorming, I'm assuming.\n\nThen yesterday she comes out with a list and once again, it's more names that we can not pronounce or names from kids at her school that she's not exactly friends with but still fall in to the criteria of (what I would assume to be) cultural names of other refugee kids. Some of them are beautiful names, don't get me wrong. But it just doesn't fit with us personally and not only that, but I'm not looking to offend anyone by using a name that isn't for us (not sure how else to word that). So we told her again, we would not be using these types of names. She got kind of angry, which was surprising, and said that we were judging her friends names \"because we are white\". That's not the case though but no matter how I explained it, she is still pissed.

She's just excited about finally having a sister, Since having a sibling of the same gender is what a lot of kids yearn for during teenage. \n\n\nBut it's your choice on what you name your baby.

She's old enough to understand about cultural appropriation. So gently explain that you can't name the baby something from another person's culture because that wouldn't be the right thing to do. But the fact that she is excited is a good thing. Tell her that you would love for her to be involved. Include her in decorating the nursery and choosing themes and baby clothes (she'd love that.) Let her shop for some clothes for herself, too. Make it a fun day for all the girls. With names, tell her no names that belong to anyone else, not the names of her friends or relatives.

You're overthinking this and have plenty of time before baby arrives. The fun part is coming up with the names, not selecting any of them. Just keep the conversation going (\"Ooh, my favorite of this list is this one, what else can you come up with?\") and steer her in the right direction.

All of the family can suggest names. All must agree, or you and your huband will decide on a certain date (to avoid stalling tactics.)\n\nGirls this age love rules, structures and boundaries, so they know what is what.

He was the only child for six years. To avoid him being jealous of the new baby (me) they encouraged him by letting him pick my middle name. The true irony is that they ended up calling me by my middle name. Also it is a much better fit for my personality than my first name.", "How about you sit down with her to brainstorm ideas? That could be a fun little bonding activity, maybe you could look through a baby name list and talk about which ones you like. Obviously, you do not have to name the baby any of the names she\u2019 picks out- but it would be an easy way to make her feel involved in the process to talk about names with her.

In fact I have a friend who is still very annoyed that his parents promised the he could pick his new sibling's name. And they never actually fulfilled their promise. He calls his little brother \"Zorro,\" anyway, though. \ud83d\ude01", "NAH\n\nThis is just a situation I think you're overthinking.

She's 10, you can at the very least humor her. You obviously don't have to act on it.\n\nYTA for not understanding a 10 year old. /s\n\nNAH, obviously. But like seriously now...just go along with it. She's a kid. Don't have to make drama out of nothing.", "YTA - all you had to do was thank her for her suggestions and say you\u2019d take them into consideration. She\u2019s just excited and you had to stomp on that excitement.", "YTA\n\nGeesh, what's the harm in entertaining her heart and creativity?\n\nI have a bunch of kids and my wife pretended to entertain all my ideas even though she was ultimately making the choice.\n\nEncourage creativity and involvement rather than stifling it.

You helped us think through so much, but don't you think 'Jane' is beautiful?\"  She will more than likely be ok with it and feel involved.  If she is unhappy, this is where parenting skills come in.", "YTA for the casual racism and the way you handled the situation.", "NTA but maybe give her a nice selection of names to pick from so she's still involved", "YTA.

There's no need to tell her that you don't like her suggestions.", "super soft YTA just because of how you handled it. she's 10 so of course you're not going to let her pick the baby's name, but it wouldn't hurt to let her feel included and not just shut her down. thank her for the list, say you'll talk about it and you're so happy she's excited to have a sister. maybe let her help pick out colors for the nursery, if you'll be having one, or a blanket or stuffed animal. she just wants to be involved.", "NTA.

But I sure as shit would not sit there and let her say I\u2019m a racist.  Of course, you opened that door by trying to logic your way out of an corner with a small child.

Why would you? I think it\u2019s more reasonable to get upset when a parent names their kid some very cultural, generational name when they have nothing to do with that culture. I think it\u2019s actually extremely important for her to also learn that so saying \u201cwe won\u2019t be doing the cultural names of her friends\u201d is on base. \n\nStill think you could have been nicer and just went along with it and at the end say you ended up with a different name but thank her for the suggestions", "I think you didn't do a very good job of explaining. You focused on what you're not doing (everything she wants) instead of what is important to you in naming your child. Of course she's hearing judgement. NTA, but you did a crappy job of discussing it", "NAH. My older daughter wanted to name her sister Scorpina. While the name is cool it's definitely not something I would pick. In the end we told her that while the name was awesome, we had other ideas. Maybe you and your husband can come up with some ideas and see if she likes them? Maybe have a list and she can pick a few that she likes best.", "NAH\n\nShe\u2019s just being a kid. You still have like 19 weeks for her to lose interest in her current name list. If you want her to feel involved in the naming process then you should make your own list and ask for her opinions on the pre-approved names. Also maybe find another baby-centered activity that will make her feel like she\u2019s contributing and like she matters. 10 is a great age for crafts! Like knitting, writing stories and making baby books, making toys or making artwork for the baby\u2019s walls. Giving her a job or a role here in some way is an investment in the future sibling and family relationships.", "YTA.

My daughter gave us tons of suggestions, even though my wife and I already had a girl name chosen (the backup from when we had our first boy).  We did nothing to discourage her, and let her be included (even taking her to the ultrasound).  Just told her that her suggestions were pretty and we\u2019d think about them.  \n\nTurns out we had a boy and had to think of something (weren\u2019t settled on a boy name yet).\n\nI don\u2019t see why you don\u2019t want her to feel like she\u2019s helping.  Ask yourself this though, if she was your daughter (and not step) would you have done the same thing?", "There's a difference between not letting her help pick a name, and giving her parameters for the kind of name you're looking for. As someone else commented, she's old enough to understand cultural appropriation and why it would be weird to give your white child a \"cultural name\". When you have this discussion, be sure to specify the culture you're referring to and how it's different from your own, because the way you're describing it here isn't great.\n\n>said that we were judging her friends names \"because we are white\".\n\nShe is right in the sense that you keep saying these names are hard to pronounce. That's honestly kind of lightweight racist even if you don't mean it like that. Aside from that, NAH", "NAH. Maybe she can \u201chelp\u201d you plan your registry or help plan a baby shower?

How hard is that?", "NAH  \n\n\nJust let her play this game \"I am choosing my sister's name\".  When my mum was pregnant, I was suggesting to choose some English name or other European ones (we're Eastern Slavs and, gosh, exotic names are not well-combined with our surnames and patronymic names).  Mum was like \"keep looking for other names\". I eventually got tired from that and forgot by the time my brothers were born - but it was fun to learn about different names and their meanings.  \n\n\nThough, still a bit bitter that you can't choose any name if you are an Eastern Slav XD", "Going to say NTA.

Hopefully you don\u2019t pass this on to your new baby.", "NAH too, a 10 year old is capable of understanding culture too (hence the white person comment) and this can be explained to her in an age appropriate way.

She\u2019s 10. You can just politely humor her and let her be excited.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s racist. I\u2019m a white American and I didn\u2019t entertain the thought of naming my babies Muhammad or Hinata because it\u2019s just not my culture to use it from.
