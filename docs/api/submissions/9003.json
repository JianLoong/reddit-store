You\u2019re not a good person to her and her decision to not go to your wedding is a good one. I applaud it.

Just dumb shit.", "The fact she stated that she is her \u201chalf sister\u201d makes me think it\u2019s more personal then catering.", "I\u2019ve been in a LDR for a year and then married right away. I dare OP to say my relationship wasn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d. What a beach.", "YTA, op. That\u2019s a long relationship, not a flavor of the month. It\u2019s also not THAT difficult to add one extra person after you confirm. Trust me, I literally missed that one of my guests was bringing a plus one (they were invited to bring someone, I just missed that they were) until the day of. My venue was super chill about it.", "Plus, she's almost definitely lying about catering being finalized already. That's almost always done (as far as final headcount) in the month prior to the wedding. My caterers got final headcount a week prior.", "It's the \"they've been in ***actual*** relationships\" (emphasis mine) for me. OP obviously doesn't feel that Ella's relationship is \"real.\" I am not a fan of long-distance relationships for myself, but they are just as much \"actual relationships\" as more traditional relationships. \n\nOP, it's obvious that you don't respect Ella's relationship. I mean, you can invite (or not invite) whomever you want to your wedding, but no one is obligated to attend.", "Here\u2019s where I\u2019m confused. If she doesn\u2019t consider her *half* sisters bf of 4 years to be \u201creal\u201d And thinks of that relationship as an eye roll. \n\nAnd if she needs to point out her sister is half (I have a half sister, I\u2019ve NEVER called her that, she\u2019s my little sister, that\u2019s it) - she clearly has so little care and respect for her sister, why does she care if said sister doesn\u2019t come? \n\nShe clearly doesn\u2019t even like her. \n\nWait, is it because your mutual parents and family WILL care? Hopefully your sister tells them what\u2019s happening. YTA", "Jealousy?", "yeah like her friends would be hurt if they didn't get +1's so OP had to give her friends +1s ... but doesn't have to give her a sister a +1 for being hurt she doesn't get a +1? doesn't compute.", "I'm guessing OP edited that info out, because I'm not seeing it. She's 100% TA.", "Did OP verify the 2019?", "So her sister can be focused on her and do her bidding all day. I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "I'll be honest, I really don't get this trend of gatekeeping +1's at a wedding. I'm in my 50's and have been to a LOT of weddings - it was always \"let us know if you're bringing a date or not\", not \"we will decide if we deem your +1 worthy enough to attend\". I dunno, it seems very Bridezilla-ish to me. It's her choice, I guess, but if I got an invite to a wedding with restrictions like this it would be a big \"no thanks\" from me.", "Your wedding, your choice for sure. But you also have to accept that other ppl can make choices based on your decisions and should be respected not name-called. This and destination weddings are the worst.", "I mean, I don't know that its dictating whether its valid, but its fair to have some kind of \"cutoff\", as arbitrary as it may be, as to what people in a relationship get a plus 1 and which ones don't.  I've been to some weddings that were \"if you weren't engaged or living together\" they didn't get a plus one.  I don't think that really means they are saying the relationship isn't \"valid\", just that for the number of people they have, they aren't getting an invitation.", "We squeezed my aunt and her bf in 5 days before daughter's wedding.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10se2cp/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_a_1_to_my_wedding/j70xqb7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", ">She is choosing to not attend without him.\n\nEspecially since it's rare time they see each other in person. He comes to visit and she's supposed to ditch him for a day or two?", "This is absolutely the reason why. OP doesn't respect her sister's relationship.\n\nAnd you know what? If sister asked for a +1 because her best friend was going to be in town, OP should find a way to make it happen just as a courtesy and common decency to the sister and the friend.", "Haha I had to google LD boyfriend to figure out that it meant long distance. Glad I wasn\u2019t the only one!", "I honestly don't understand either. What does it matter to the bride and groom how long the rest have been dating? They can be married for 10 years and break up the day after the wedding.\n\nI hope than when/if her sister gets married, she won't invite OP's husband because \"they haven't been married for *that* long, that's not a *real* marriage\"", "Just did the same.  Now we\u2019re still doing it because we\u2019re waiting for visas.  It sucks.", "That makes a lot of sense. She might be pretending to care so she can play the victim. She doesn't really care if her sister attends the wedding, she just doesn't want anyone blaming her for that.", "A few persons said the same before so I forced myself to figure out how to link a comment and I guess it's not so hard and I'm just lazy and never learned how hahahah\n\nAnyways, [here's OP's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10se2cp/comment/j70xqb7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) where she says they have been dating since 2019. I guess she didn't include that on the original post because she knew it made no sense to claim only long term couples where invited after writing that.", "I only know because OP said they have been dating since 2019. Unless OP comes and says 'oh no, I meant 2019 seconds', I think it's verified.\n\nI would link the comment but I don't know how haha but grandma can copy and paste:\n\n**Comment:** INFO. How long has your sister been with her LD boyfriend?\n\n**OP's response:** 2019. We went on vacation and that's how they met, but they haven't seen each other since then", "I agree! Personally, I hate when people invite anyone who is not married without giving them a +1. It can really suck to attend a wedding solo, and you should let people bring someone with them if they choose - regardless of whether or not they are in a relationship.", "This post made my blood boil. LDRs are hard enough as it is, without people constantly diminishing them. \n\nHonestly it's bad enough just hearing the \"I could never do long distance\" from every second person you talk to, let alone having your 4 year long relationship belittled to the point where it's considered \"not a real relationship\". Unbelievable.", "Judging.  That\u2019s all this is.  Her relationship is not serious enough for the bride to fork over a plus 1.   So now she gets to judge her guests before inviting.", "She doesn't like her half sister.", "To be perfectly honest, I can more about not hurting my friends than my brother. I see my brother once every 2 years, we basically talk on birthdays and that\u2019s it. He\u2019s not a bad guy, but he\u2019s kinda in acquaintance territory. My close friends? I see them weekly, we text daily, they\u2019ve been there for me through a lot of things. They\u2019re more family than my brother. Frankly they\u2019re more important to me than my brother.", "So, a lie by omission of sorts. OP is a real piece of work.", "Thank you. She has been so lovely to everyone though everything which makes it easier and harder at the same time.", "Wait wait wait... so you're telling me that you don't cook the food right away and keep it warm for 2 months before the event?!?! \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f /s", "Which brings us to my fave LPT- you can ask if you can have another serving of whatever catering provides if you want it.  They usually have spares.  A very nice waiter named Kevin once taught me that.", "Lol, so you can have one to eat also, along with your 6 friends. Good planning I say!", "I do the same when we have guests for dinner. Cooking the exact amount of food for the number of guests you'll be having is the type of gambling I'm not willing to do.", "That's pretty mind blowing, lol.", "Last summer a friend of mine had like 10 people have to drop out because it was all one friend group who had hung out the weekend prior and, well, you can guess what happened!", "Also if everything goes to plan it means you get to have bonus desserts later."]}
