Reconsider if you can...", ">I have guests who're single or in casual relationships, none of them got a +1\n\nWhich your sister doesn't fit into those, she's been with her boyfriend for years too.", "So your half-sister who has been in a relationship for years isn't validly hurt because ...?", "And your respond to them being upset is to invite their partners of years, why isn't this the response of your sister being upset about not inviting her partner of years?", "So now you've decided that you're the judge of who's in a serious relationship. That seems unreasonable. I'm not sure how you can explain it away.", "Your sister's relationship is not casual and she is not single. She is not in the same category as those people, and you know it.\n\nYou should have treated her as exactly the same as your friends in longterm relationships and invited him by name. \n\n\nDid you think she would invite him over that week and then ignore him all weekend given they are long distance?", "But she's also... been in a relationship with someone for years? So why shouldn't she be hurt", "she\u2019s been with her partner for years and is hurt, what\u2019s the difference?", "Dude you're an AH. You compared a relationship of 3 years to the boyfriend of the month. In that case your wife is just the wife of this year until yall hit 10 years.", "If you have friends who have been with their partners for years, then yes, they also deserve a +1 for their partners. In your post, you didn\u2019t say \u201cjust married or engaged,\u201d you said \u201clong term SO,\u201d and I thought, \u201cawesome,\u201d that you were respecting long-term relationships without being silly about it. However, your comments indicate that you do not respect long-term relationships after all. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, do what you what and invite who you want, but you\u2019re being disingenuous about your reasons to not include +1s, and in my opinion you do deserve the kick-back you\u2019re getting here for the reasons you\u2019ve given.", "Your sister has also been in a relationship for years.", "is four years not long term?", ">only people we know have a long term SO received a +1.\n\nIs the LD boyfriend NOT a long term SO?", "And friends feelings you didn\u2019t want to hurt apparently but screw your sisters feelings\u2026", "They met in 2019 and it's interesting and sad they haven't seen each other since.  How long has your sister considered him her boyfriend?  If it's been since 2019 then this definitely is a long term relationship.  Your criteria was that your other guests with plus one invites were relationships with their SOs for over two years.   Since your sister's relationship surpasses that time frame, what is the real reason you aren't allowing your sister a plus one?  Is this your definition of a casual relationship? \n\nIf you feel strongly about this then don't allow the boyfriend to come and know your sister won't be there either.  It is after all your wedding.  You can invite or not invite whomever you wish.  However, ask yourself if not inviting the boyfriend is worth the erosion of your relationship with your sister.  Only you know the answer to that.", "And you picked out who is considered a long term relationship. Apparently being together for 3-4 years is not long term, who knew? YTA and you know it.", "Your sister has been in a relationship for 3-4 years, her relationship is JUST as longterm as anyone else.", "So what is he going to be doing whilst she's at your wedding all day & night? Really crappy introduction to your whole family for him, this must be a big trip as far as they are both concerned, don't be surprised if your sister bails on you.", "Okay, then I think NAH. Her request is not unreasonable, in a general sense, but your decision about how +1s work for your wedding is also your decision. Have you met this bf yet?\n\nETA: After learning how long OP's sister and sister's bf have been together, I change my vote to YTA because 3+ years is a LTR and deserves a +1.", "It's worse than that, her half-sister has been with her boyfriend for 3+ years. She's  just being an asshole who diminishes long distance relationships or that just doesn't like her half sister", "OP refuses to reply to anyone asking this question. OP also has not replied to anyone asking how long she has been with her own partner\u2026", "They've been together since 2019, curious to hear from OP how this is not a long-term SO", "Right - like, they got together and then a deadly global pandemic shut everything down and restricted travel.  Meanwhile, OP is over here telling her sister that her relationship isn't valid or some shit because they haven't blatantly disobeyed travel restrictions during an actual pandemic.", "I'd say OP is TA, OP says guests who are in a long term relationship got a +1, but their half sister who has been with her partner for 3-4 years doesn't get one. So OP's decision for how +1s works only applies to other people, not to their sister. OP is being a hypocrite or not giving the real reason they don't want the bf to be there.", "I would bet actual money that OP's relationship was shorter, but they see THEIRS as more legit. Because only they and their schmoopsiepoo experience REAL love, and relationships that fall outside OP's tastes just aren't as legitimate in their eyes.\n\nOP how would you like it if someone close to you invited just you to their wedding? Without your schmoopsiepoo? And invited everyone else's partners?", "After seeing how long sister and bf have been together, I agree. I made my comment before OP had responded to the question about the length of their relationship."]}
