FWIW I do think OP should just let him come. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to say that a traditional relationship of 3 years (or even say a traditional relationship of 1 year plus LD for 2) is more serious than what OP\u2019s sister has going on.", "I think OP doesn\u2019t like her half-sister so giving importance to her friends over family.", "Covid, work schedules, school schedules, the rampant inflation occuring around the globe making plane tickets unaffordable for a large portion of the population? \n\nI think managing to keep a relationship together for 4 years not having them with you is a massive accomplishment. \n\nAnd I bet the relationship is longer than OPs.", ">but if they were such a serious couple why have they never met up in the last 4 years?\n\nI'm on a LDR I started dating my partner early 2020, could not meet her again until late 2021. Thankfully we could afford it since I wasn't laid off due to covid. But half sister and her gf might have had issues finding money and time off from work to be able to see each other sooner. There's also some countries that have also been locked down for longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't just \"some guy she met on holiday 4 years ago\", this is her partner of 4 years.", "I kind of agree that OP has a point about the relationship maybe not actually being that serious, but still think they should invite her. No one is going to be upset that the bride or groom\u2019s *sister* possibly got \u201cspecial treatment\u201d so I don\u2019t think \u201cpeople will be upset they couldn\u2019t bring their short-term partner when they see some guy they don\u2019t recognize\u201d is a great argument. Sure you have to set a cutoff somewhere, but to me it makes sense to be more lenient with a close family member when it only adds one more person and that person is important to them (even if I personally think it\u2019s silly).", "ahaha because it is MOST DEFINITELY a shorter time than her sister.", "Seems like a person in a 2 year relationship and a friend is more long term that a person in a 4 relationship and family", "Exactly. Which is fine for that friend - as that IS a long term relationship and should also be respected.\n\nI think it's fair to say you don't have room to accommodate new relationships (e.g. under 6 months) but if you are leaving out oartbers of 3+ years then it looks and feels like a personal slight.", "I have roughly 16 \"half siblings.\" I was raised with two of them. Those are my brothers. The other 14 get the half title because I don't know them. We're related, and I feel that I should state that, but I barely know them, so I don't call them my actual siblings. Maybe OP and her sister were raised separately, and they don't have a very solid relationship. Doesn't make this right imo. I wonder if OP isn't so mad about her half-sister not attending and more upset that people will ask where she is, and OP will look like a dick when the truth comes out.", "I know three people whose relationships started off as long distance and are now happily married who would disagree with you.", "You\u2019re doing literally the same thing. Diminishing a LD relationship. The OP has not said how many times her sister & partner have actually seen each other. It honestly sounds like there are deeper issues between the sisters and OP is taking advantage of that and not mentioning that. \n\nHonestly it\u2019s pretty gross and sad the folks diminishing a LD relation and saying it\u2019s not normal.", "Where does it say that she has been with him for 3+ years? Did she edit it out?", "Why is it silly to consider someone you've been dating for 4 years important?", "Where did op say 2019?", "OP replied to a comment asking how long they've been together and OP said since 2019.", "That they've only seen once in that four years? That's why it's silly. The only time they've seen each other is when they first met.", "Plus OP also invited a friend who has been in a relationship for a couple of years. So shorter than her sister. I say OP is TA", "In a comment", "Covid pretty much killed two of those years for long distance couples. Depending on their economic situation it might have been extremely hard for them to meet again too. I don't think it's silly.", "Hmm it's either deleted or edited out, I don't see it", "And the other two years? It's not like they were well established before the pandemic.", "As I said in the comment, could be caused by their economic situation. Could've also be due to health issues or work not letting them have days off at the same time. If it wasn't something serious they wouldn't have been dating for 4 years.", "Doesn't dating imply going on, you know, dates?\n\nFrom the info we have this could easily be a holiday fling that means a lot more to OPs sister than to the guy."]}
