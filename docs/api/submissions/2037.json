Why does it fall on you to stand up to the FIL? I\u2019m sure if you did you would have been called an AH for that. You were in a no-win situation. FIL brought this extra cost on himself.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.   Sad that you couldn't escape the blame.  Did she also blame the groom?", "NTA the entire family put you in an impossible situation, not to mention making you work through the entire wedding. If they wanted a professional, they should have hired one. If they had a budget, they should have told you.", "Nta your brothers FIL wanted something  so now he has to pay the bill for his request.", "How is anything that happened after you were relieved your fault? NTA.", "NTA and a no-win situation. if you stood up to your SILS dad and he caused a scene she'd blame you for ruining her wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou covered all your bases. None of this is on you. Honestly you sound awesome.\n\nThese were all adults. You checked back with your brother and that's it. It's just lazy from anyone to blame you.", "NTA, I would tell you sil to F off. You did cut people off her dad insisted. You checked with the groom and so you stepped away cause you knew it was wrong after warning them. You were put in an impossible situation", "NTA - you were in a no win situation. If you had stood up to the FIL, she'd be mad because you made a scene.", "NTA. These were all grown adults, correct? Each and every one of them is responsible for themselves.", "Sound to me like you were being a good bartender. Nta\n\nI've never understood getting drunk at weddings. Here is one of the happiest days in your life and you want to get drunk? Why?", "Nta for not over serving and  backing off either", "NTA. In no way was it your place to stand up to this dude. You definitely did the right thing by getting out of dodge. I think you handled everything perfectly.", "NTA. You were the only one responsible and you tried to apply your expertise to give them a good experience. \n\nThe father of the bride was an AH for doing the ridiculous power move of \"I'm paying so do as I say\", everyone else is an AH for getting belligerent about not being served booze and later getting wasted and trashing the place... at a wedding (exactly how crass are these people? lol). \n\nAnd the bride is as AH too, because she decided you would be the scapegoat for the reception fiasco so even upon learning you have nothing to do with it and it's all her father, she still tries to find a way to blame you. Not standing up to him? The only one who didn't stand up to the man was your brother, her new husband, who literally instructed you to do as FIL said. \n\nI don't call your brother an AH because he did back your story up when it was needed, but he's quite something too (I can't say anything because I don't know what is considered \"uncivil\" and worthy of a ban anymore).", "NTA for sure. The blame is on your entire ass family for this one. You\u2019d think they not want a trash shitstorm at their wedding.", "NTA\n\nI think you did everything you could have to avoid this situation and did the right thing and stepped away when you couldn't avoid it anymore.", "Nta", "NTA. It was a shrewd move to refuse to be complicit.", "Seems like a lot of this could have been sorted before the wedding. Did the guests know that the bar was closed until after the speeches or just you? And was there any discussion between you, FIL or bride/groom about refusing to serve? You must have known people would get drunk. At a UK wedding its common to find plenty of very drunk people by the end of the night but then again the damage can usually be fixed with a mop.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No you weren\u2019t. That\u2019s why you walked away from the bar. As a 40 yr bartending veteran, I know this is a tricky situation, however we both know you always err on the side of safety. We have all found reasons to shut it down. SIL\u2019s Dad was stupid & reckless. Asking your brother was stupid, he is at his wedding, he was probably a little busy. The aftermath is certainly not your fault, however don\u2019t think you will be getting a gold star for being the hero. Everyone is incredibly lucky that all they are paying for is damage to the facility.\n\nETA \u2014 unlike everyone here we both know you would be liable in this situation. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Hopefully, your brother recognized he put you in a no win situation.", "NTA-You know you could have gone to jail for over serving so you protected yourself.  FIL should pay for all the damages since he decided to let everyone get shit faced.  He\u2019s the one who\u2019s the AH.", "NTA. You could get held responsible if one of the guests had gotten into an accident after you overserved them. You talked to an authority figure when confronted by another and bowed out. \n\nYour brother agreed with FIL, so you were surrounded by AHs and did the only responsible thing.\n\nYou covered all the necessary bases.", "NTA. You did stand up. You stopped it, the guy paying said to keep going, you ran it by your brother, and he agreed to keep going. You\u2019re not an idiot, so you opted to not be a part of over serving people because it will fuck with your job.\n\nIf your SIL wants to be mad at you, ask her why her husband isn\u2019t a part of the problem. Ask where she was in all this. It\u2019s HER father, so it\u2019s HER responsibility to deal with him.", "NTA - You did everything you could", "NTA, you were told by the man paying, your brother, and your father that you were not allowed to cut anyone off.  You walked away from service because you disagreed with that so what happened after that is in no way on you.  Everyone ignored your professional opinion and is now dealing with the fallout.  That is neither your fault nor your problem.  You did what you could and walked away when you couldn't do any more like you were supposed to as an adult.", "ESH your brother for not hiring a licensed bartender (which is legally required in most states), the FIL for being an AH, the guests for over drinking and you for not cutting these people off, they had to have been obviously drunk when you were serving them and then you let the drunk people serve... smh\n\n>Wow I was completely surprised when things got out of hand.\n\nThis is a lie", "Not to mention the groom *also* said to do it.  SIL needs to be mad at the correct people.  Her new husband and her dad.  Not OP who got out of serving when they saw where the signs were pointing.", "He was just confirming to me that he wasn't on the hook for any damages.", "Because OP can\u2019t get karma from just knowing inside their head that they were obviously not in the wrong", "To be fair, SIL didn't know what her dad had asked OP to do. Once she found out she blamed him as well.", "Google dram laws.", "Fair enough.", "It\u2019s called sarcasm.", "Lol hell no, OP is not an asshole. OP wiped themselves of responsibility after they tried to him continue to serve drunk people, and stepped aside so they could make their own cock up. \n\nAlso the sentence you quoted was clearly sarcasm.", "He was obviously being sarcastic when he said he was surprised.", "My comment refers to the groom endorsing FIL's instruction to serve no limit.   Did she blame him for that?", "Plus I love this sub and this was my first chance to have something worth posting.", "After she found out is what I\u2019m referring too", "Yeah our bar staff have legal duties too but when you're asking friends and relatives to help out at a private function, would you not expect a slightly more relaxed approach? Or is it common knowledge there that bartenders are in shit if they don't stick to the rules religiously?", "I hate these types of events! Some idiot always getting stupid & belligerent. \u201cI\u2019m paying\u201d shut the hell up no one cares. Sorry, you can\u2019t pay me enough to over serve people. I always blame some made up town office or the ABC. \u201cThe permitting office only gave us permission to serve until 9. If you get permission from them then I\u2019ll keep serving otherwise it\u2019s getting shut down. Have a great night!\u201d", "If OP is TIPS certified (or has any certification) he knows he can be held liable at a private event in a private facility as soon as he starts serving. It\u2019s why people hire certified bartenders so it\u2019s not a free for all drunk fest", "Man I just got out of there as fast as I could.", "But your story concludes with you clearing your name and your SIL not even being mad at you, but at her dad. What\u2019s even the debate here? You\u2019re just re-litigating a conflict where you came out being in the right", "I highly doubt that OP was hired to do this, just a favour to family, and in no way could they even be held liable if he was hired because he stopped serving.", "Um. I'm not sure if it's reading comprehension or just too lazy to read the last sentence of post.", "I highly doubt you know what Dram shop laws are. Fortunately, OP knows what they are"]}
