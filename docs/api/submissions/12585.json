Only civil messages will be read from now on, when I have time for them.\" Then block them. I bet someone will keep you updated re: real family news. They feel entitled to be be cruel and crazy. That has to stop.", "It makes perfect sense that a woman could want her own mother present with her at the birth of her child, but not her husband's mother.  The level of intimacy is so different.  I loved my MIL, but I would not have wanted her there when my children were born.  And since this particular MIL sounds as though she is more about rights than about the relationship, I can't imagine why anyone would be surprised that she was not welcome in the delivery room.  She's probably have been critiquing DIL's breathing techniques.\n\nSure, it's a little hard on the MIL in this case that she can't go and meet the baby, but what exactly was she planning to do?  She claims the 'right' to meet the baby and spend time with the baby.  That's, er, nice.  Nothing about how she would want to take some of the burden off the new mother, how she'd be happy to spoil the mother of her new grandchild by doing some of the chores, etc.  It sounds as though she wants the privilege of being able to hold the baby, and none of the responsibilities involved when you visit a newborn and a recently post-partum mother.  Your mother sounds, in face, thoroughly selfish.  (And she knew in advance that the new parents wanted to keep to themselves for the first month, too.)\n\nI cannot imagine that none of this attitude has spilled over into the relationship with her son and DIL.\n\nAlso, a new mother doesn't want a bunch of visitors, and this is entirely reasonable.  DIL's mother has the first first two weeks, and was there for good reasons.  Your mother feels she should be on an equal footing with the new mother's own mother.  She is wrong.  I mean, seriously.  What new mother would welcome the company of someone who is getting nasty and bitter, and whose response to photos of the baby is to criticise everything?  Wow.\n\nYou are absolutely right that your mother is risking the whole relationship by this entitled behaviour.  I applaud you for telling her some home truths.  You were not too harsh: you were right.  Not that it helps, when someone is as entitled as your mother.\n\nNTA.  Be strong!  Be an awesome auntie/uncle!", "NTA.\n\nIf she is complaining about pictures I can only imagine what she has said in the past to SIL. Good of you for standing up for them.", "NTA  It's something  your mother needed to hear. Next time she starts to complain tell her you don't want to hear it, but apparently your dad and whoever else said you were wrong does, so she needs to tell it to them. They'll change their tune soon enough.", "NTA and I can\u2019t blame Op\u2019s brother for not wanting his mom there, she doesn\u2019t seem to have anything nice to say anyways. People keep commenting that it\u2019s unfair that MIL gets to get there but not OP\u2019s mom, but y\u2019all understand that is fundamentally different, right? SIL just gave birth, that\u2019s a difficult and traumatic experience, she should be allowed to have whoever she wants surrounding her during this time for support. Op\u2019s mom sounds too petty and judgmental to actually offer support, they don\u2019t want her there in the first place and that\u2019s all the matters here.", "NTA. I don't think it's unreasonable to respect the wishes of your brother and SIL. Ultimately it's up to them and I can see how you'd get tired and snap at her a bit. I get your mother is hurt but they aren't shutting her out forever. I imagine it's very overwhelming for your SIL right now. It makes sense she wants her mother. Also? If your mom is being this nasty to them because she has to wait a month to meet the baby? How else would she behave? In person. It could stress out your brother and SIL more if she's able to be this nasty and disrespectful. Does your mom have a history of being this way with your brother and SIL?", "NTA. And you are probably quite right in your observations. Your mother is well on her way to ruining any chance of a good relationship with that part of the family.", "You are absolutely NTA and thank you standing up for the new parents as I am sure your brother and SIL would strongly agree with your words. Some MILs turn into JUSTNOMILS when grandchildren are involved and it's pretty ugly to witness it first hand  and furthermore when you are being pulled into her unjustified and bitter rants.

We reconciled but it took a lot of soul searching.\nHow much of this nasty behavior will your SIL be expected to take before she puts her foot down and says no more?", "Why your brother didn't want your mother there? Why one grandma went and not the other?", "ESH. She wasn\u2019t allowed to be a part of her grandchild\u2019s first weeks.

Your mother sounds a bit like my MIL. I have not had my first baby yet, but I am pregnant,  and my husband and I just bought a house near my parents because I need that support. \n\nMy own MIL made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to be used for childcare - she only wants to visit baby. I see where her relationship could have broken down with her eldest son and DIL because of this. You want to be part of baby's life but you don't want to do the work? Raising an infant is a lot of work.\n\nI think you were a bit harsh in how you phrased it to your mother, but what you said was something she needed to hear in order to protect hers and her son's relationship. He married that woman, and really- for the first 2 months, visitors should be kept at an absolute minimum to protect baby's health.\n\nI don't know if your parents promised to help the new parents in any way, or if they're feeling miffed because they don't have preferential visiting rights.\n\nBut you're NTA.", "yta , she juste want to see her grand children but isn't allowed but the SIL is ? she is right to be mad \n\n&#x200B;\n\nand to be fair, you should be ashamed of not defending your own mother about a double standart", "Tbh, without more background it sounds like ESH.

And you a little for blowing up at her.\n\nSounds like there\u2019s a real problem with your brother\u2019s relationship with your mother, and the \u201cno visitors\u201d rule is really a \u201cno mother\u201d rule.", "NTA\n\nTheir baby, their rules. Lots of people limit exposure to visitors during the first few months, which is a sensible precaution as newborns are more vulnerable to viruses.

We also chose no visitors during our time to bond, I didn't feel like having to deal with anyone else while tired, emotional, ect. Entitled mil can kiss ass, not her kid, not her birth. I'd have blown up at her, too. And in far less time than you. I don't get the esh thoughts here, she already alienated one of her kids and is super judgemental of the rest.", "NTA.

OP tell your mother that if she keeps being nasty with the new parents you will tell them. And be ready to tell them if she doesn't stop.

Not too uncommon.\n\nBut I agree, everyone sucks here.", "This is what I was coming to say ESH - There's either some past drama between your brother and mother or the SIL doesn't like her MIL. I can completely understand the after stress of having children and getting settled. Excluding one gma and allowing the other is always going to cause severe drama. Yeah, mom is not handling it well at all and is being annoying, but sounds like she is quite deeply hurt. It all boils down to the choice is up to your brother and SIL, but they are being asses unless mom has been a major problem previously and earned it. You could've been a little more considerate to your mom, but it doesn't hurt to give her a little dose of reality either.", "Wow, you think people should only get to have a relationship with a baby/kid if they're willing to be free babysitters? That is such an entitled attitude.", "And she can wait like the rest of us.\nShe can't dictate what my brother and his wife wants, I can't change it.", "NTA\n\nI agree that the OP needs to stay out of it and prioritize herself.\n\nIt might be hurtful for the OP's mom, but she is an adult who is criticizing everything other adults are doing related to the grandbaby. The OP's mom constant criticizing may indicate a lot about her overall personality. \n\nThe wife may not have a good relationship with OP's mom and that's why she does not want her near in her vulnerable time. It's not like she is the only one who is not invited to meet the baby. She could tone down the constant criticism. \n\nShe is going to meet the baby after a month. So, she has something to look forward to. She could prep meals, buys clothes, toys, etc etc if she wants to.

It's nice that you are also supportive.", "Okay she wanted her mom. What about your brother? Didn't he want his mother to be there in this special moment?", "I can understand SIL wanting the comfort of her mom while also wanting to keep baby safe for the first couple of weeks. It *is* unfair to MIL, but it\u2019s also their right.", "That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying a baby is a lot of work, and if someone is volunteering to help so you can even get an hour's rest and they happen to be family, you let them in.\n\nBut for the protection of baby - because immunity doesn't really develop until 2 months - you can't bring in a parade of people into your home. You have to be selective. \n\nIn my own case, my parents live in the same neighborhood. My husband's parents live over an hour away. My father immunocompromised just like I am, and we sheltered the entire pandemic. My husband's family continued to go out meeting friends (there's nothing wrong with living life), but they've also all caught covid at some point. Despite working in hospitals, no one from my family has caught covid.\n\nAnd covid is just the litmus test. I'm just saying that in my case (not necessarily OP's), there is a difference in the support that both mother's are/can offering, and while the infant has not officially \"Come out\" to the world at it's baptism, then the parents have a right to be selective about who is coming into their home.\n\nYou may think it's an entitled attitude, but if you have the opportunity to shelter an immumocompromised individual (in this case the infant), you would. \n\nHowever, I still stand that once the baby has it's debut, then all family can come.", "You could said that IF mil was not there but here you are still debating about a double standart \n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou can't change it but blame this on her like she was the bad person , but hey just talk about your own mother on internet just because she want to see her grandchild like the other MIL , what an evil person right", "Childbirth isn't a spectator sport, and the brother didn't push a baby out his vagina.

Why should Mother's preferences take precedence over those of every single person directly involved in this event?", "It wasn't her son who was having a difficult birth, and also, with a mother like that I would want distance even if it was my mother.

Because this same mom helped her through puberty and various shitty bodily functions in this new mom\u2019s life. The father is fine.

I made that decision based on what I needed, and I chose the person that could offer it. I think your mom has it in her head that her mother is spending all of this time bonding with baby, but it\u2019s highly unlikely. If she\u2019s doing a good job, she\u2019s doing literally everything BUT bonding with baby so that the new parents can focus on that themselves. It\u2019s not nearly as glamorous or fun as it sounds to some people. I think you were right to stand up for them, and they will highly appreciate it. Hopefully your mom can come to terms with the fact that it\u2019s nothing personal, and has nothing to do with being the baby\u2019s grandmother, but rather being the new Mom\u2019s support.", "NTA and thank you for standing up for your brother and SIL.", "I do hope you\u2019re keeping your brother informed of your mother\u2019s reactions.

It worked out well; we stayed 2 nights, were within walking distance, have a great relationship with DIL, and enjoy her mother. We also had a nice mini-vacation of our own as they live in a great city. My philosophy was, their kid, their choices.

The moment she starts becoming vile this turns into an NTA situation with her being the TA", "Being a grandparent is a PRIVILEGE not a right.\n\nOf course she would want her OWN MOTHER there.\n\n>It's pretty much a lot of spite and jealousy on my mom's part,\n\nABSOLUTELY TRUTH.\n\nShe is NOT the parent and what they say goes.  Not harsh.\n\nYour mom needed the reality check and if she doesn't curb her ways she might be slapped with a harsher one.\n\nTime to think about yourself and let her sink or swim on her own. Let your mom deal with the consequences of her actions on her own.\n\nNTA", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nYour mom can thank herself for this due to her own overbearing tendencies based on your comments. She's already had 1 kid cut her off for it.", "NTA. But I see why your SIL didn\u2019t want her around for the first month.", "NTA. You're absolutely correct in this situation. Bro's and SIL's rights as a parent trumps any perceived rights as grandparents mom thinks she has.", "NTA\nWhat you told her was the truth", "NTA. You actually did your mom a favor by warning her that her jealousy and unreasonable expectations will ensure that she never gets to meet her grandchild.", "nta", "NTA. In fact I think you're doing her a favor. The facts are its not her kid and to be happy with the time she will get. So many people would benefit for putting their yardsticks away rather than measuring every instance of their life to others.", "NTA. Your mother definitely needs to get over herself.", "NTA you understand your SIL's position. Having a baby is not a spectator sport. \n\nYour mother really will burn her bridges with this attitude. I get she wants to meet the baby but their rules are not uncommon. And she has to respect them.", "\ud83c\udfc6 Here. I wish we still had free awards.", "NTA, you are right and the more she criticizes the more she will be held at bay. From now on, just let her know you are uncomfortable talking about people and won\u2019t discuss this. She should talk to them. Keep this on repeat she will get tired of hearing it. In the meantime remember electronics are here to make our lives better, answer the phone and texts when it works for you. The works has gone on for years without instant and constant communication. Be good to yourself.", "It's normal if one of them is nasty and has nothing nice to say", "Who knows if she was like this before. But most grandmas would be pissed if shown this kinda preference. A month is a long time not to meet your new grandkid, if you\u2019re not already NC which he\u2019s sending pics everyday so probably not. I think that\u2019s a dick move, \u201chere\u2019s your grand baby but you\u2019re not allowed to meet him but my wife\u2019s mom can\u201d. Sounds like they\u2019re are the toxic ones.\n\nI would understand the first couple days, but a month is a long time. I\u2019d feel slighted and I\u2019m a childfree uncle, but I do have like 20 nieces and nephews so I\u2019d just pay attention to another family and ignore the one who doesn\u2019t want me around.", "NTA. Tell your mom she doesn\u2019t have equal rights to new mom\u2019s mom. A son is a son \u2018til he takes a wife, a daughter\u2019s a daughter all her life. \nTell your mom to get used to it. She\u2019ll live.", "NTA. Most women want their mothers with them during and after birth. There\u2019s no comfort like a mother\u2019s touch, no matter how old you are. Your mother\u2019s behaviour is incredibly immature and selfish. I\u2019m not surprised your brother and SIL didn\u2019t ask her to help out.", "NTA \nBut please give your brother a heads-up so he knows what to expect.", "NTA, send your SIL to r/justnoMIL cause she\u2019s gonna need it", "NTA I would have paid for someone like you to be in my life when I had my kids.", "NTA and jeez louise. I have sons and I have a darling dil, but I\u2019m quite sure she wouldn\u2019t want me there while she\u2019s got Christmas all spread eagled. I remember what that was like, and those first few zombie weeks after birth? Back off and follow whatever those new parents want! Sheesh!\n\nThat mother keeps on and she\u2019s going to lose both of her kids.", "NTA. Personally I think waiting two weeks to meet the new baby could be a little frustrating, but I understand where your SIL is coming from. \n\nWhen my (M) first child was born, the first grandparent to visit was my father, with my mother the next day. My wife's parents had a car breakdown and didn't make it down for a couple of weeks. But that was very much set by circumstances, and the fact that we were in hospital for a few days due to minor complications, and needed distraction. \n\nPlus I could call my father, who was driving up to see my brother, and announce it by saying \"Hey, you know how you're driving to see your youngest grandchild? You're driving the wrong way\" \n\nI've heard it put like this \"in delivery, a woman will want to be there for her daughter. Let the man help take care of the baby.\"", "NTA. I would hang up on her for the next couple of weeks.", "Nope NTA. You're the kind of family most people wish they had. Someone sensible who understands and respects boundaries AND manage to communicate that to others less sensible! Love you for that!", "NTA at all. When my mom had my younger siblings I remember my grandma (her mom) coming to stay with us for a couple of weeks to help my mom with cooking and cleaning while my dad was at work. Not that my mom had an issue with my dad's mom it's just she was more comfortable with her own mom. I thought that was the norm cause that's all I have ever seen. Ask your mom who came to help her when she had you and her siblings and why. The people complaining about what you said are wrong as is your mom. Everything you said to her was facts.", "She sounds like my mom. Doesn't actually care about anything other than competing with other mother-like figures in my life and superficial BS. She was the subject of my last therapy session. Uhg.", "Could maybe be relevant to add this info to your post.", "So, I guess OP's mother found this thread or..?\nNo, the MIL has NO right to be anywhere - except supporting the new family from the comfort her home and humbly awaiting an invitation for a visit when the new family finds it suitable - THAT'S ALL!", "Yes she has every right to be there.", "  NTA Op. ask your mum if she had most help from her mum or mil when you were all born and tell her as much as she wants to see baby it is not going happen much if she continues to bitch and criticise. Then tell her if she still wants to criticise then to do it to folk who support her eg her husband and leave you alone. Good luck \ud83e\udd1e", "NTA and your brother and SIL are lucky to have you on their side since they cannot deal with your mother on their own right now and have enough on their hands. youre right about your mother and she needs to quit it asap.", "NTA. You can tell her: ok, if you think you've been behaving reasonably I can fill Brother in on everything you've been saying."]}
