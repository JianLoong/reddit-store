I canceled Discovery because there was enough content overlap to not justify paying for both. \n\nYou might consider talking directly to your BIL about sharing accounts.  \n\nThey can also use the savings from cable to get their own Netflix etc accounts.  You should also make sure their access doesn't include the ability to upgrade your account.  \n\nI'd be most concerned about sharing the Amazon Prime account.

Your sister is taking advantage of you, and she knows it.\n\nPersonally, I would change all the passwords to everything. Then I would set up my devices and my parents, but not my sister's things.
