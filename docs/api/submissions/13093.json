I kept correcting her just saying its actually Angie and I even said with a smile that I get she\u2019s probably nervous and it\u2019s always nerve wracking meeting new people. It got to the point where I corrected her so much that it almost felt like she was doing it deliberately and I found it really rude and idk about anyone else but I think it\u2019s common courtesy to respect someone enough to at least call them by the right name. She wouldn\u2019t stop calling me the wrong name and it really irked me so I just said it was nice to meet her but I\u2019m sorry but I have to go and just left.\n\nMy brother is now mad because he feels like I made it clear I didn\u2019t like his girlfriend. Apparently her feelings are hurt and he wants me to apologise. I told him frankly, I don\u2019t care about how she feels. What about me? I was there for like an hour and she constantly  kept calling me the wrong name and it felt like I was being disrespected so I left. He is telling me I\u2019m a grown woman and to deal with someone not calling me the wrong name. I just feel that even if she was nervous why wouldn\u2019t she get it even after a few times of me saying my name is Angie. Was I the AH?\n\nEdit: I only mentioned my full name to make causal conversation and to have like an icebreaker as I wanted her to feel at ease.\n\nI also don\u2019t know if it matters but I\u2019m 27, my brother is 25 and his girlfriend is 22.\n\nEdit 2: I was with them at a coffee shop. It was just us, nobody else so it\u2019s not like she had a ton of names to remember and maybe she got confused.

You asked her to use a very common nickname!  I don't know what her deal is, but I wouldn't have stuck around to find out either.", "NTA - You repeatedly stopped and politely corrected her and she still insisted on calling you the incorrect name.  Once or twice (even three times) is an accident, this was more that that and can only be intentional disrespect.

You should even reply 'i didn't have a strong opinion before but I definitely dislike her now'.", "NTA. How did she even know your given name to use those nicknames? It sounds like your brother may have used Evangeline to describe you before the meeting. But either way, it's NOT HARD to use someone's preferred name.

Whether she's doing it because she's just a bully, or for some weird reason feels the need to get one over on you, you're right not to tolerate it.  \n\nTell your brother that it is not a sign of maturity to roll over and accept disrespect.

That's really weird and disrespectful. It almost sounds like some kind of power move on her part. You have absolutely zero reason to apologize... though it might be kind of delightfully petty to send her a nice apology and address her by whatever incorrect name you like throughout, lol.", "Yeah she sounds annoying, I would have left too. Idgaf if her feewings are hurt, it\u2019s just plain disrespectful. It\u2019s one thing if it happens once, but to continuously do after being corrected is definitely on purpose. NTA.", "NTA. If someone keeps calling you the wrong thing after you\u2019ve repeatedly told them the right one, then they are the asshole. Your name isn\u2019t even hard in any way, but even if it was, everyone deserves the respect of people using their name properly. Your brother is also the asshole here, telling you that you should just deal with it. You should not.

I would like to see him react in your shoes.", "NTA Screw her.", "Absolutely NTA. I do not understand people who won't call people their preferred name. I go by a name that has nothing to do with my first name, but it is what I like the best.
