I kept correcting her just saying its actually Angie and I even said with a smile that I get she\u2019s probably nervous and it\u2019s always nerve wracking meeting new people. It got to the point where I corrected her so much that it almost felt like she was doing it deliberately and I found it really rude and idk about anyone else but I think it\u2019s common courtesy to respect someone enough to at least call them by the right name.

I was there for like an hour and she constantly  kept calling me the wrong name and it felt like I was being disrespected so I left. He is telling me I\u2019m a grown woman and to deal with someone not calling me the wrong name.

You asked her to use a very common nickname!  I don't know what her deal is, but I wouldn't have stuck around to find out either.", "NTA - You repeatedly stopped and politely corrected her and she still insisted on calling you the incorrect name.  Once or twice (even three times) is an accident, this was more that that and can only be intentional disrespect.

You should even reply 'i didn't have a strong opinion before but I definitely dislike her now'.", "NTA. How did she even know your given name to use those nicknames? It sounds like your brother may have used Evangeline to describe you before the meeting. But either way, it's NOT HARD to use someone's preferred name.

Whether she's doing it because she's just a bully, or for some weird reason feels the need to get one over on you, you're right not to tolerate it.  \n\nTell your brother that it is not a sign of maturity to roll over and accept disrespect.

That's really weird and disrespectful. It almost sounds like some kind of power move on her part. You have absolutely zero reason to apologize... though it might be kind of delightfully petty to send her a nice apology and address her by whatever incorrect name you like throughout, lol.", "Yeah she sounds annoying, I would have left too. Idgaf if her feewings are hurt, it\u2019s just plain disrespectful. It\u2019s one thing if it happens once, but to continuously do after being corrected is definitely on purpose. NTA.", "NTA. If someone keeps calling you the wrong thing after you\u2019ve repeatedly told them the right one, then they are the asshole. Your name isn\u2019t even hard in any way, but even if it was, everyone deserves the respect of people using their name properly. Your brother is also the asshole here, telling you that you should just deal with it. You should not.

Refusing to call you your preferred name consistently *despite* being continually corrected is deliberate. This honestly feels like some sort of \u201cI\u2019m the most important woman in your brother\u2019s life now,\u201d marking-her-territory power play, which is gross. \n\n>> I\u2019m a grown woman\n\nHis girlfriend is *also* a grown woman behaving horribly toward you.

I would like to see him react in your shoes.", "NTA Screw her.", "Absolutely NTA. I do not understand people who won't call people their preferred name. I go by a name that has nothing to do with my first name, but it is what I like the best.

Tell your brother you will not be apologizing to his inconsiderate girlfriend and if wants there to be any chance that could ever like her, then SHE needs to apologize to YOU.

It's pretty easy to stay someone addressing you with the wrong name, You simply don't respond to the wrong name, after correcting the person a time or two, or you say \"Who's Eve?\" Also, you can use  a wrong name for them each time they use a wrong name for you.

Continue to immediately correct her each time until she gets it. I wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019d be that hard for your brother to ask her to call you Angie from now on. If she doesn\u2019t like the name, she doesn\u2019t have to use it at all. It is very easy to have a conversation without constantly using the person\u2019s name.

Assuming no neurological issues, cut her some slack.  Give her another chance.\n\nBut keep an eye for someone who's trying to come between you.

Except hers was Angeline and she went by Angie. Her whole life.\n\nWhich means the whole time I read this I pictured my Granny getting more and more angry.

You also don't owe her shit. I don't care how nervous she was. There's no way it was still nerves a solid hour in. That was an intentional power play on her part. FOH with that. Her and your brother.", "NTA.\n\nIt's shocking how rude your brother's gf was. \n\nI'd suggest you pull your brother aside and explain that if his gf wants you to be nice or apologise, she needs to firstly refer to you by your name (Angie). You explicitly told her what to call you and you repeated yourself X number of times. What was it about your response that was difficult for his GF to comprehend?\n\nWait for him to address that issue - ignoring how upset his gf is, why was she not able to grasp the concept of calling people by their preferred name?\n\nTell your brother he's welcome to organise another catch up and you'll give his GF another chance to act right (perhaps don't use those exact words but something along those lines).  If you see she's capable of being respectful, then you'll apologise. Make that clear to him - you're offering a solution and all he needs to do is follow the process here. You'll apologise if you see his GF calling you by the correct name. \n\nHis gf sounds too immature. Sigh. Good luck here.", "NHA, but OP is very close to be the AH of the story.\n\nLook, I get this more than the average person as I too have a history of people not using the name I prefer. My legal name is shortened version of a more common one, so many times people think they are being formal by calling me that. I usually correct them (I have dealt with a Bond actor who does this, but I figure if you play James Bond I can give you a pass). I am a junior, so an \"ie\" was added to my name so that the family could differentiate me from my dad. But it was *family* and friends of my parents only, none of my friends have ever called me anything else. I always know when someone calls me this they know my folks. Don't get me started on anyone using my very unique last name.\n\n**So, yes, I do get it.**  But at no point does OP claim that she has some **trigger issue** with being called by any of those other names or that \"Angie\" has some special connection, like a favorite dead relative. \n\n>I also don\u2019t know if it matters but I\u2019m 27, my brother is 25 and his girlfriend is 22.\n\nFunny how that part, usually given up front in these posts, was literally the last thing OP stated.\n\nOf course it matters. Are you and your brother tight? I would assume so because people who aren't rarely introduce girlfriends. Heck, my brother never met my wife, almost none of my ex-GFs and only met my current SO of 6 years because I took her to a couple Christmas dinners. \n\nSo try to imagine how much your brother might have built you up and added pressure to this 22 year old. Some of us were fully mature at 16/17 and some take into their 20s to get a handle on being a grown ass adult. She was almost certainly nervous as hell and sometimes when we get nervous our brains short circuit and we can't stop from doing something. She's also young enough that calling someone by a nickname that others don't is a sign of respect for them. A way to form a bond, if you will. \n\nAlso, **how much warning did you give the GF and how sternly?** Did you just let yourself get angrier and angrier without letting on or did you every say, \"Look, I don't know how else to tell you this but please stop calling me all those other names. My name is 'Angie', okay?\"", "You have to be kidding? Someone wouldn\u2019t call you by your preferred nickname? Thought i felt a shudder in the force.", "Her feelings are hurt?

NTA.", "NTA\n\nSay \"I'm sorry *Dorris.* I understand how difficult it is to remember names. I hope we can move past this.\"\n\nAnd just proceed to call her \"Dorris\" or something similarly wrong. Do NOT act snarky. Play innocent and apologetic, match her energy. But ONLY keep it up so long as she keeps mis-naming you. When *she* gets it right, *you* get it right.\n\nThe only way for either of them to address this is to admit she's in the wrong.\n\nBut this is a VERY petty solution, from and internet stranger, who doesn't have to live with the consequences. So grain of salt.", "NTA / did your brother maybe tell her something??", "NTA.\n\nYou were even polite about it. \n\nI would have called her a slew of wrong names on purpose after correcting her a few times.
