Idgaf if her feewings are hurt, it\u2019s just plain disrespectful. It\u2019s one thing if it happens once, but to continuously do after being corrected is definitely on purpose. NTA.", "NTA.

If she\u2019d only mentioned it, the gf would have either assumed her full name was Angela and called her that, or asked what Angie is short for and would have still misnamed OP.  And OP had zero reason to believe the gf would be so disrespectful, most people respect it when you ask to be called by your nickname", "I'm down with the pettiness. Just call her \"Fred\" every time you see her, unless her name is actually Fred, then call her Barney.", "This absolutely cracked me up", "I find using anyone's name that much kind of weird anyway - even if it was the right name. Perhaps this is a cultural thing.\nUnless the girlfriend has some type of hearing problem she is just rude.", "Didn\u2019t even realise this is fucking Disney \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I'm exactly the same, I try and use their name as often as possible when I first meet them to cement it in my memory.

I literally said it didn\u2019t matter.", "Petty Rubble", "Or Swarley", "But it\u2019s really nice Disney - look how she lights up the sky - ma belle Evangeline.  \nSo the adorable although slightly stalkery lightning bug thinks you\u2019re beautiful", "And also NTA - sorry! Singing it in my head and forgot to vote"]}
