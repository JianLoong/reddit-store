Well done:)", "You need to have your attorney serve them papers for discriminating against your daughter. NTA.", "INFO - what does your DAUGHTER think. Your opinion doesn't matter here.

It sounds like they lump all disabilities into one category, when a reasonable person would know that each individual disability will affect a person differently. Obviously, a deaf person would be very physically able to cheer on a competitive team, and it sounds like your daughter has the skills to do so. \n\nHowever, I think your daughter is old enough to understand your concerns and be a big part of the decision-making process. Calmly sit her down and explain that you feel she is being treated unfairly. Ask if she feels like the decision to put her on the \"disabled\" team was a good or fair one. Talk about what you should do as a family moving forward. She may really enjoy taking a less competitive role in cheer, and if that's the case you need to back off. However, if she feels it was unfair and wants to be on the competitive team, you have my permission to go full on Poppa Bear. She just needs to know that you are listening to what she wants and that you'll take her direction going forward. \n\nI'd also include your sons in a separate discussion to get their perspective. They have skin in this game too. I guess what I'm really saying is that this should be, in part, a family discussion.", "NTA, keep advocating for your daughter!

They are discriminating against her when she's able to compete with reasonable accommodations (an interpreter.)  That is seriously messed up and is potentially illegal.", "NTA.

However- you really rubbed me the wrong way", "NTA and it sounds like they are trying to walk all over you because they think your daughter is more disabled than she is. I would suggest pulling your kids from that gym and finding a better one, the only ones being albeist (If any) are those coachs by singling out your daughter and refusing to let her be on the \"normal\" teams just because she's deaf.", "NTA.

They need to accommodate her not you. Nta.", "This would annoy me too. People with disabilities are not some homogeneous group. When the disability doesn't really impact the activity, why shouldn't they be included in regular teams? Especially if their skill level matches or exceeds that of the other team members. Even if small accommodations need to be made - isn't it worthwhile compared to having her lose the skills she's trained hard to acquire? I'd continue advocating on her behalf because my guess is that she will lose motivation in a team that doesn't challenge her.", "Yes very. They\u2019ve fought with the coaches about this far more than I have.", "Dad* but seriously thank you it means a lot.", "She wants to on the team that matches her skill level and to be with her friends.

The alternative, being forced into an aide role to volunteer to hep kids with special needs, is not what she signed up for.

But, the way this gym is sorting the cheerleaders sounds unfair. The kids should go with the team that meets their training level. I understand the need for an abilities team if there are older, bigger kids that are at the cheer skill level of younger, smaller kids. You don\u2019t want to run into a safety issue.

Obviously the father has watched his daughter succeed in some of the highest levels of cheerleading and wants to see her continue to improve. But, when moving to a new gym It is to be assumed that they are not prepared for all potential needs that athletes might have, therefore the best solution in their mind would be to place her on a team where they work at a slower pace so they could adjust to her needs at a pace that makes them comfortable. Especially if you have moved her to a small D2 gym (which is sounds like it is) these faculties have far less funding and it may make the accommodations more difficult for them to make. After all if something were to happen to her they would be the ones held liable. But, if father\u2019s willing to pay for interpreters to bridge the gap so she could be on her true level team then I believe that the gym should start working to ensure that they are prepared to have her placed on a higher level team. I can see both sides of the situation.", "NTA.

But wildly enough, the best part of this experience was when we decided to tutor the mentally handicapped school students and take them to carnegie hall.

Have fun with that. Every parent is going to be mad at you and every kid is going to be mad at your daughter.", "Her friends are at the old gym. That's not relevant", "Yes it\u2019s illegal. Where are the people that protect the rights of deaf people.", "I\u2019m not following\u2026 are you suggesting the daughter would take multiple spots? And the other kids deserve them because they aren\u2019t disabled? \n\nOr that the coaches will retaliate?", "No these are friends that she\u2019s made at our current gym who all want her on the team with them.", "No, the OP says the daughter has made friends with the kids on on the 6th level at the new gym. This is the chat she\u2019s referring to.", "No, he says in the post that she has friends at the new gym on the team she should be on.", "No, according to OP, she's made friends at the new gym already.", "Retaliate. I'm suggesting that they would tell the kids and parents that didn't make it to the team that it's because of OP's ultimatum.", "He wants her in the team that has a better skill set, because she is qualified and competent for it. It's not his fault the cognitive difficulties of the children of the other team apparently result in bulk in a cheering squad of lower skill than what befits his daughter.", "Her *skill set* is better and her dad wants her to be on the team that will challenge and enhance her skills. He never said his daughter is \"better\" than anyone else on a level other than what they compete at- and that's not a nasty description. It's a fact that regardless of physical or mental differences, some people are better at things than others. She's better at the skills required for cheer than the abilities team is, and anyone taking that as OP putting anyone else down is just looking for an argument. It's blatantly obvious that his issue is not with the fact that there's an abilities team, it's that his daughter is well beyond that skill set and is being pushed into the abilities team because of being Deaf. That's not okay.", "You're either looking for a fight or don't know shit about cheer. An eleven-year-old should absolutely *not* be helping people who are that much older and larger than she is. That's negligent on the gym's part, regardless of anything else.\n\nWhy the fuck are *you* so determined to lump everyone with a disability into one category? That's not how disabilities work at all. There are hundreds of different ones, all with different levels of impact for the individual who has been diagnosed.\n\nYou seem so set on OP being hateful, you have been deliberately ignoring that her skills outweigh the current class she's in, she's made friends on the other team, wants to be with those kids/they want her around, and is being made to coach the others in her group rather than being able to practice and learn new skills. You really sound as if for some reason you want this kid to be held back because...why? There's a group for \"people like her\"?", "Disabled people don't always have to be lumped together. Shockingly, they all have different interests and capabilities. Disabled people also might not be instant friends with all other disabled people. They are, in fact, human.", "First of all- I said everyone was the asshole including the gym. And no I never said she should be helping with everything. I made it pretty clear that my issue was the parent saying all the reasons they don\u2019t want the kid in- without ever saying the kid wanted out. As soon as they said their kid didn\u2019t want to be in there- like I said many times is fine.", "Oh fascinating. What an original thought. If you look back I specifically said many times if that\u2019s what she wants- to be switched then that\u2019s great- but that my issue was that he seemed to be highlighting they just didn\u2019t want them with disabled students.", "Um, it\u2019s not irrelevant that the coaches at this gym are using a minor to assist in capacities she\u2019s not comfortable with. Whether or not OP\u2019s daughter considers herself disabled is besides the point, the point is she\u2019s been put in a class at a much lower level than she should be and is therefore not able to develop her skills.\n\nFunctionally this is a language difference, not a difference of ability. OP\u2019s daughter speaks a different language than the other kids and they discriminated against her based on that. OP, NTA.", "I said everyone was an asshole not just the parent- my biggest question was did the kid want to be moved or not- which took many questions for the parent to answer."]}
