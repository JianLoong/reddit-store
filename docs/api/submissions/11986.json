My boys are hearing and my daughter is Deaf. She can\u2019t speak at all or lipread, she communicates solely through ASL. However, she is neurotypical and has no mental or developmental delays.\n\nShe\u2019s been cheerleading since she was 3 and is very talented. On her old team she was a flyer and was doing very advanced stunts and tricks. At our old cheer gym she was on the level 5 junior team which is very high and they said that she should be moved up to level 6. But we moved over the summer and now there is only one cheer gym within an hour of us.\n\nWhen my daughter tried out she was just as good if not beyond the other girls in her age group and I really thought she would make one of the higher teams as they kept using her as an example for the other girls. But then after I was pulled aside by the coaches and told that they thought it was best for her to be on the abilities team. I never heard of that and the way they described it was that it was a team specifically for cheerleaders with disabilities to make it more inclusive. I wasn\u2019t fully aware what it meant but I said that was okay.\n\nBut now I\u2019m aware that this team is for kids who are neurodiverse or unable to participate in normal cheer.There are also older girls on the team(who also compete on their own team)who are helpers. Since my daughter is completely fine other than her lack of hearing she usually has to help out the other kids most of whom are much older than her. I am very upset by this. \n\nThe level of difficulty is far lower than what she was doing at the old gym.And she didn\u2019t volunteer to be a teacher or a aid for disabled kids, she wants to be a cheerleader. And being on this team has made her worse, not better.My boys have to work with her in the backyard everyday to ensure she\u2019s not losing any of her skills that she used to do. \n\nRight now my son interprets her since her practices are right after his and it works fine. But I\u2019ve offered them to pay for a real interpreter. But they say they fear her being on a real team would make it harder for the other kids on the team. This is ridiculous because she\u2019s become good friends with the girls her age on the normal team and they\u2019ve been very accepting even picking up some signs for her and inviting her to their team hangouts and sleepovers.\n\nThe season is mostly over so there\u2019s not much to do now but I told the head coach yesterday that if my daughter isn\u2019t on the level 6 team next year I\u2019m taking all 3 of my kids to a new gym. They need my boys since it\u2019s very hard to find boys of their skill level in cheer. They accused me of being ableist and thinking of the abilities team as lower, they think I\u2019m in denial that I have a disabled kid. And I should be grateful they let her on any team. I don\u2019t want to be mean or ableist but the team she is on is far below her skill level and I don\u2019t want her disability holding her back when it doesn\u2019t have to.

And I should be grateful they let her on any team.\n\nThis is wild to me. They think you're being ableist, but they think she should be grateful for being included even though she's got skills?? She may be disabled but that doesn't mean she's at the same skill level as every other disabled cheerleader.\n\nNTA. If your daughter can keep up with the \"regular\" team then there's no reason for her not to be able to join. Sounds like discrimination on the part of the gym, not you.", "NTA\u2010 This is straight up discrimination. Take all 3 of your kids to another gym this one is trash. If you're in the US isn't this covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act?", "NTA. You're a kick-ass mom, though! Well done:)", "You need to have your attorney serve them papers for discriminating against your daughter. NTA.", "INFO - what does your DAUGHTER think. Your opinion doesn't matter here. Only hers.", "NTA.  If they don't let her on the proper team you should contact their governing body.  What they're doing is some audist bullshit and illegal.", "NTA and a disability lawyer would have a field day with this.", "NTA and yes, pack up your kids and go elsewhere.", "NTA. It sounds like they lump all disabilities into one category, when a reasonable person would know that each individual disability will affect a person differently. Obviously, a deaf person would be very physically able to cheer on a competitive team, and it sounds like your daughter has the skills to do so. \n\nHowever, I think your daughter is old enough to understand your concerns and be a big part of the decision-making process. Calmly sit her down and explain that you feel she is being treated unfairly. Ask if she feels like the decision to put her on the \"disabled\" team was a good or fair one. Talk about what you should do as a family moving forward. She may really enjoy taking a less competitive role in cheer, and if that's the case you need to back off. However, if she feels it was unfair and wants to be on the competitive team, you have my permission to go full on Poppa Bear. She just needs to know that you are listening to what she wants and that you'll take her direction going forward. \n\nI'd also include your sons in a separate discussion to get their perspective. They have skin in this game too. I guess what I'm really saying is that this should be, in part, a family discussion.", "NTA, keep advocating for your daughter! They're trying to define her as a disability, not even factoring in what kind, and not seeing her as a *person*.", "NTA.  They are discriminating against her when she's able to compete with reasonable accommodations (an interpreter.)  That is seriously messed up and is potentially illegal.", "NTA. They seem to think that just because someone has one disability, they should be treated as a generic disabled person. Your daughter should be able to have a choice to do something she wants on her level.", "NTA, but you will be if you stay at this gym. These people are beyond ableist themselves and are stifling your daughter\u2019s talents because they don\u2019t respect deaf people.", "Everyone is the asshole here. \nYour daughter is disabled- there is nothing wrong with that. Perhaps not other her from the disabled community. That being said they should honor the child\u2019s wishes with accommodations. However- you really rubbed me the wrong way", "NTA and it sounds like they are trying to walk all over you because they think your daughter is more disabled than she is. I would suggest pulling your kids from that gym and finding a better one, the only ones being albeist (If any) are those coachs by singling out your daughter and refusing to let her be on the \"normal\" teams just because she's deaf.", "NTA. Go dad, you rock!", "Tell them she goes on her skill level team or the boys walk. Boys are a hot commodity in cheer and dance, girls are a dime a dozen. You have the power.", "NTA- my nephew played competitive hockey in high school and the goalie was deaf\u2026 excellent goalie and his hearing had no impact on him participating.", "NTA. If anyone is being ableist, it's the gym. They don't think your daughter is capable of being on the high skills team because of her deafness.", "NTA. Sounds like they don\u2019t want to take the time or make the effort into accommodating your daughter\u2019s disability.", "NTA - Sounds like the coach is just too lazy and doesn\u2019t wanna put in the effort with your daughter. I mean if an interpreter will be provided then I don\u2019t see the problem. Maybe the other girls on the \u201cnormal\u201d team could do with learning some ASL to better communicate. Surely that would be good for everyone involved.", "Sounds more like they are being discriminatory towards your daughter.\n\nSticking everyone with a disability in the same level/ team regardless of personal skill is pathetic of them.\n\nEven the paralympics doesn't have a deaf criteria, its not considered to be detrimental enough of a disability to be allowed to compete in the paralympics.", "NTA go to the principal about that discrimination law suit those coaches are getting started.\n\nThey\u2019re being ableist - your daughter can cheer on the typical team just fine. They\u2019re making a deal out of it because oh lort they\u2019ll need a translator up there for her.", "Info are you in the US???? Cause if so this is hella illegal. They need to accommodate her not you. Nta.", "This would annoy me too. People with disabilities are not some homogeneous group. When the disability doesn't really impact the activity, why shouldn't they be included in regular teams? Especially if their skill level matches or exceeds that of the other team members. Even if small accommodations need to be made - isn't it worthwhile compared to having her lose the skills she's trained hard to acquire? I'd continue advocating on her behalf because my guess is that she will lose motivation in a team that doesn't challenge her.", "Yes very. They\u2019ve fought with the coaches about this far more than I have.", "Dad* but seriously thank you it means a lot.", "She wants to on the team that matches her skill level and to be with her friends. They all find it very unfair which is why they have her on the level 6 team chat and always invite her to everything.", "Sorry I did that Im not really sure what to say. I do my best to not other her from her community. We moved so she could attend a better school for the Deaf and I always ensure she has a lot of Deaf/Disabled people around her. I just feel in this specific instance it\u2019s not something necessary.", "I agree with the not \"othering\" (overall), and everyone should be taught kindness and how to relate to others, but being placed with the abilities team sounds like it's detrimental to OP's daughter. She's losing skills she held prior and isn't properly training due to being deputized to help others on the abilities team. She's being held back on account of being Deaf, not being held back because she cannot process or perform what's required to be on the other team.", "We actually learned (a very little) sign in middle school. Even finger spelling is a totally cool \u201ccode\u201d at that age.", "It\u2019s a private club not in school", "That\u2019s great- and that\u2019s fine if that\u2019s what your daughter wants. I was specifically referencing it rubbed me the wrong way that you didn\u2019t want her in the group for disabled students- specifically those who have cognitive disabilities. If your daughter wants to be moved that\u2019s one thing- however- as someone who has a lot of cognitively disabled people in my life- i am used to people not wanting their kids around \u201cthem\u201d", "As I said in my other comments- it\u2019s one thing if she wants to be moved. They have only stated that  they don\u2019t like it- nothing about what the daughter wants", "Welp, the owners then.", "I don\u2019t mind my daughter being around them and being kind. But she\u2019s only 11 and having to assist 15-19 year old disabled people with things like stunts and tricks. Firstly, I don\u2019t want it to be her responsibility if someone gets hurt  and secondly, she didn\u2019t sign up for this. Nothing against them, they are all an incredibly kind and welcoming team.", "I don\u2019t think in this instance it was about the disabled kids in the class. It was simply about his daughter. It was simply the skill of the other  cheer class was lower than she\u2019s at. She wasn\u2019t even cheering as this new gym and she\u2019s a cheerleader. \n\nAnyone set of kids could have been in that class but if she\u2019s wasn\u2019t cheering or it was at a level lower than she\u2019s accustomed to, I think OP would respond in thus same manner.", "Yeah my kid has autism and what I got out of this was dad thought his kid was better than the disabled kids so he was being just as bad and as the ones excluding his daughter!", "Bullshit excuse- again- your daughter is disabled- why are you referring to the other disabled kids as if she\u2019s not apart of that community. \nThe risk of injury is the same regardless if you\u2019re doing tricks and stunts. \nThere are additionally aids to help students. I would suggest log off and work on your internalized ableism. \nalso I have yet to hear you say your daughter wants to change- I\u2019ve only heard you complain that she\u2019s not \u201cdeveloping skills\u201d as fast. She\u2019s 11 bro. What is with this pressure", "That\u2019s exactly what I got from it too.", "She does.", "Ok? Then why not lead with that.
