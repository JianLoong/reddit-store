She may be disabled but that doesn't mean she's at the same skill level as every other disabled cheerleader.\n\nNTA.

Well done:)", "You need to have your attorney serve them papers for discriminating against your daughter. NTA.", "INFO - what does your DAUGHTER think. Your opinion doesn't matter here.

It sounds like they lump all disabilities into one category, when a reasonable person would know that each individual disability will affect a person differently. Obviously, a deaf person would be very physically able to cheer on a competitive team, and it sounds like your daughter has the skills to do so. \n\nHowever, I think your daughter is old enough to understand your concerns and be a big part of the decision-making process. Calmly sit her down and explain that you feel she is being treated unfairly. Ask if she feels like the decision to put her on the \"disabled\" team was a good or fair one. Talk about what you should do as a family moving forward. She may really enjoy taking a less competitive role in cheer, and if that's the case you need to back off. However, if she feels it was unfair and wants to be on the competitive team, you have my permission to go full on Poppa Bear. She just needs to know that you are listening to what she wants and that you'll take her direction going forward. \n\nI'd also include your sons in a separate discussion to get their perspective. They have skin in this game too. I guess what I'm really saying is that this should be, in part, a family discussion.", "NTA, keep advocating for your daughter!

They are discriminating against her when she's able to compete with reasonable accommodations (an interpreter.)  That is seriously messed up and is potentially illegal.", "NTA.

However- you really rubbed me the wrong way", "NTA and it sounds like they are trying to walk all over you because they think your daughter is more disabled than she is. I would suggest pulling your kids from that gym and finding a better one, the only ones being albeist (If any) are those coachs by singling out your daughter and refusing to let her be on the \"normal\" teams just because she's deaf.", "NTA.

They need to accommodate her not you. Nta.", "This would annoy me too. People with disabilities are not some homogeneous group. When the disability doesn't really impact the activity, why shouldn't they be included in regular teams? Especially if their skill level matches or exceeds that of the other team members. Even if small accommodations need to be made - isn't it worthwhile compared to having her lose the skills she's trained hard to acquire? I'd continue advocating on her behalf because my guess is that she will lose motivation in a team that doesn't challenge her.", "Yes very. They\u2019ve fought with the coaches about this far more than I have.", "Dad* but seriously thank you it means a lot.", "She wants to on the team that matches her skill level and to be with her friends.

But, the way this gym is sorting the cheerleaders sounds unfair. The kids should go with the team that meets their training level. I understand the need for an abilities team if there are older, bigger kids that are at the cheer skill level of younger, smaller kids. You don\u2019t want to run into a safety issue.

Obviously the father has watched his daughter succeed in some of the highest levels of cheerleading and wants to see her continue to improve. But, when moving to a new gym It is to be assumed that they are not prepared for all potential needs that athletes might have, therefore the best solution in their mind would be to place her on a team where they work at a slower pace so they could adjust to her needs at a pace that makes them comfortable. Especially if you have moved her to a small D2 gym (which is sounds like it is) these faculties have far less funding and it may make the accommodations more difficult for them to make. After all if something were to happen to her they would be the ones held liable. But, if father\u2019s willing to pay for interpreters to bridge the gap so she could be on her true level team then I believe that the gym should start working to ensure that they are prepared to have her placed on a higher level team. I can see both sides of the situation.", "NTA.

But wildly enough, the best part of this experience was when we decided to tutor the mentally handicapped school students and take them to carnegie hall.

Inclusion is where people with disabilities are included in the \"normal\" team. Not segregated to be amongst themselves and not interact with able bodied people. That's the opposite of inclusion for someone who is on the level of the other kids. It's holding her back. For children who aren't and who need extra care a seperate team is a different form of inclusion, since if there wasn't a seperate team they would not be able to participate at all and would be excluded because their level wasn't good enough or they need too much guidance. So no, you're not ableist. And they should not have said that. Allthough I want to add a last point. As a disabled person, it's been important for me to meet and interact with other disabled people. Why? Because we often face similar bariers to society, we all face ableism in one form or another, we experience some aspects of society differently to able bodied people. So it's important to meet peers. For it that has been important to be able to accept my disability and to  learn that I have just as much worth as able bodied people, that my worth isn't defined by my ability to work and that it is a right to be reasonably accommodated so I can participate in society. Your daugther has a right to be accommodated so she can participate at the level of competence that she has. If they don't do that for her, and put her in the inclusivity team just because she has a disability and not because it fits her level of ability then THEY are the ableist ones. \n\nRegardless, it can do her some good to meet people like her, other deaf people, through a support group or online or whatever. I don't know. Something, when she's ready. Ask her about it if she would like to meet other deaf people. Maybe she already does I can't tell from the post alone. \n\nGood luck and keep fighting for your daugther's right to be included in the world.
