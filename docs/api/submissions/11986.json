It sounds like they lump all disabilities into one category, when a reasonable person would know that each individual disability will affect a person differently. Obviously, a deaf person would be very physically able to cheer on a competitive team, and it sounds like your daughter has the skills to do so. \n\nHowever, I think your daughter is old enough to understand your concerns and be a big part of the decision-making process. Calmly sit her down and explain that you feel she is being treated unfairly. Ask if she feels like the decision to put her on the \"disabled\" team was a good or fair one. Talk about what you should do as a family moving forward. She may really enjoy taking a less competitive role in cheer, and if that's the case you need to back off. However, if she feels it was unfair and wants to be on the competitive team, you have my permission to go full on Poppa Bear. She just needs to know that you are listening to what she wants and that you'll take her direction going forward. \n\nI'd also include your sons in a separate discussion to get their perspective. They have skin in this game too. I guess what I'm really saying is that this should be, in part, a family discussion.", "NTA, keep advocating for your daughter!

When the disability doesn't really impact the activity, why shouldn't they be included in regular teams? Especially if their skill level matches or exceeds that of the other team members. Even if small accommodations need to be made - isn't it worthwhile compared to having her lose the skills she's trained hard to acquire? I'd continue advocating on her behalf because my guess is that she will lose motivation in a team that doesn't challenge her.", "Yes very. They\u2019ve fought with the coaches about this far more than I have.", "Dad* but seriously thank you it means a lot.", "She wants to on the team that matches her skill level and to be with her friends.

But, the way this gym is sorting the cheerleaders sounds unfair. The kids should go with the team that meets their training level. I understand the need for an abilities team if there are older, bigger kids that are at the cheer skill level of younger, smaller kids. You don\u2019t want to run into a safety issue.

Obviously the father has watched his daughter succeed in some of the highest levels of cheerleading and wants to see her continue to improve. But, when moving to a new gym It is to be assumed that they are not prepared for all potential needs that athletes might have, therefore the best solution in their mind would be to place her on a team where they work at a slower pace so they could adjust to her needs at a pace that makes them comfortable. Especially if you have moved her to a small D2 gym (which is sounds like it is) these faculties have far less funding and it may make the accommodations more difficult for them to make. After all if something were to happen to her they would be the ones held liable. But, if father\u2019s willing to pay for interpreters to bridge the gap so she could be on her true level team then I believe that the gym should start working to ensure that they are prepared to have her placed on a higher level team. I can see both sides of the situation.", "NTA.

So no, you're not ableist. And they should not have said that. Allthough I want to add a last point. As a disabled person, it's been important for me to meet and interact with other disabled people. Why? Because we often face similar bariers to society, we all face ableism in one form or another, we experience some aspects of society differently to able bodied people. So it's important to meet peers.

Your daugther has a right to be accommodated so she can participate at the level of competence that she has.

I hate this gym\n\nIdk if it has relevance but when I was a residential camp counselor at a girl scout camp we had a group of 4 girls.  3 were 10 and 1 was aged 12. That 1 was Emily. Oh Emily,  how they did not prepare me for you. I loved her though. Anyway we had two counselors, myself and the other one to the 4 girls.  There's also a rule,  that a camp counselor could not be alone with a camper,  the camper always needed a buddy. This means say,  during a group activity,  if a camper needed to use the bathroom they would need to get a counselor as well as another camper. Emily constantly had to use the bathroom,  which at one point did seriously and negatively impact the other 3 campers. \n\nYou see,  Emily had some stuff going on.  She was entirely non verbal,  except two words: mom, and no.  She could sign,  but this was not helpful to anyone as this was a mainstream camp.  No one could sign.  Had I known that I was going to have this camper on my first week ever as a camp counselor,  I would have totally taught myself some more signs.  The camp director literally taught me and the other counselor two or three signs before Emily came. She had other issues too, but I have no idea the extent bc I couldn't communicate with her, which sucked for me as one of her main providers that week but man it must have really sucked for her. I don't knew why her parents kept sending her to a mainstream camp. I think they put 12 yo Emily with the 10 yos to try to help,  but it was just hard for everyone. \n\nDamn kayaking was rough.  They wouldn't let the kids leave the docked swimming area bc there was really no way to know if we could keep Emily safe as no one could communicate with her. And poor Emily out there,  paddling on one side of the little boat going in circles and freaking out not understanding she needed to paddle on both sides.  And there was a communication barrier obviously so it was not fixed.  I couldn't get in the water as I was not allowed to help campers in water activities,  being the one adult who failed the fucking swim test lol. I can boat though so it was a shame I needed to watch from the lakeshore. \n\nOne time..  oh fml, we were getting ready for an activity and Emily opened her tent......... full frontal.  Everyone was very,  very nice and understanding but we were all shocked and did not know what to do.  I went into action bc fuck we can not have a nude 12 year old fuck fuck fuck I got in the tent and I'm looking for her things, like okay honey where are your clothes and she like really couldn't tell me.  I had to keep looking.  I believe she wet herself--- she was making the bathroom sign and then made her hand flat in a downward motion making the shhhhhh noise.  Very creative girl and I understood in that moment how severe the communication barrier really was. She *could* communicate we just didn't have the tools she needed us to have.  It was heartbreaking. \n\n\nI was pretty pissed at the camp for doing this to us, and to this poor girl. We were not prepared in any way for a camper with special needs and nothing about the camp made it easy to make sure she was being cared for the way she needed.  I think her parents just wanted her to feel normal but ... at what cost?  The other 3 girls had families that spent money for them to be there,  not help babysit another camper. I saw Emily's mom at the end of that week and Emily was just signing up a storm.  I will so I was happy to be one of Emily's moms that week,.I just wish my 21 yo self knew how to have done a better job.\n\n\nAt the end of that first week I took the promotion they were trying to give me.  150 extra bux for the summer to become the ropes/ challenge and adventure coordinator.  I was like yep sign me the fuck up.  I became a fun Dad lol. I got to meet the whole camp and really only be responsible for campers during our activity sessions.  Otherwise I was off the hook and assisted other counselors with what they needed.  \n\nEmily came back later that summer abs she remembered me and I made sure that girl had a kickass time on the rock wall. Great climber too.\n\n\n\nBut your daughter does not sound like Emily.  Like,  at all.  You've offered to pay for an interpreter.\n\nMy question is--- are you paying them to have your daughter work there?

Cuz wtf", "NTA level 6/7 cheerleader here - though not in the US and now open age. If your daughter was competing on a level 5 team as a junior she's very good and on her way to a really good worlds team. I assume she was flying more than just bracing pyramid (i.e. flying baskets and main stunt or partner stunts if a coed team). Anything less than a level 4-5 team is going to bore her - even a 4 team would tbh. I love cheerabilities, I make sure to watch them at comps and be involved in their teams. However they compete effectively less than level 1.\n\nHaving her on this team, will be detrimental to her skills. Tumble is easy to loose as is the flyers technique. Furthermore it's more dangerous for her. Lots of lower level athletes have no idea what they're doing so accidents are not uncommon.\n\nUnfortunately favouritism is really common at a lot of gyms and even if they do bump her up to a Level 3, 4, 5, 6 team their unwillingness to see her as a good flyer may follow her and she'll feel that - while she may make the team they may just ground her and only have her in dance tumble and jumps or just maybe bracing pyramid. If she does make the level 6 team make sure you regularly check in on how the coaches are treating her, if they seem to be grounding her. Otherwise I'd switch. You have to find a gym who clicks with her. It's not that hard to learn how to coach and train with people who need certain accommodations. For example I am neurdivergent and wear earplugs during training. I have competed at worlds several times on different very successful worlds teams. I changed gyms this year because I had moved states the previous year and didn't like the style of the initial gym I chose.

After a few weeks we pulled him out and found another club where he plays alongside neurotypical children but the staff are aware he may occasionally need a little support.\n\nSessions for children with disabilities are great in theory but in practice they often just lump everyone in together and fail to take into account the vast physical and mental differences which exist even in people with the same conditions.
