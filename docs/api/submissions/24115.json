{"id": 24115, "submission_id": "15ktof5", "title": "AITA for not letting friends from out of town stay at my home?", "selftext": "My (30F) boyfriend (35M) has 2 friends who live in another state, let's call them Jack and Liz. They want to come visit us in our state with their 4 children, ages ranging from 5-10. I live in the downtown area of our city while my boyfriend lives about 1 hour away in the suburbs. My house is close to where I go to school full-time (about a 5 minute walk) and also close to where I work (10 minute walk to my first job, 10 minute drive to my second job). I live with my 3 dogs and because of my busy schedule, I have a dog walker come everyday to feed and care for them. \n\nWhen Jack and Liz come to visit with their kids, they are asking to stay at my house. Here's the thing though, they want me to leave my house so that their family can stay there with complete privacy. I think it is also worth noting that I have never met or spoken to Jack and Liz before (they are my boyfriend's friends and not mine). Also, they are originally from our city, so they have their parents and family members who still live here. They seem pretty wealthy mostly because they tell my boyfriend that they are. Liz is a SAHM and has never worked before because Jack has had multiple inheritances from deceased family members and he brags about his high-paying job. They also own about 10 rental properties that they collect passive income from (believe they bought these houses with the inheritances). Before meeting Jack, Liz also did not work because her family is wealthy and supported her. \n\nThe thing is, my commute to work and school (I have one or both 7 days a week) is over an hour each way from my boyfriend's house in the suburbs. I already have such long days that changing my commute to be 2+ hours a day, even for a week, is giving me anxiety with all of the stuff I have going on between work and school. Also, I don't have anyone to walk my dogs at my boyfriend's house and even if I were to hire a dog walker, he doesn't want a stranger having access to enter his house. Finally, it would just be really uncomfortable to have to leave my own home and I am also nervous about having young children running around my house when I am not there and my home is not child proofed.\n\nSo, AITA? My boyfriend seems disappointed in me because I am not opening my home to his friends and I am already making a bad impression on them. He also thinks that I am doing this because I am deciding to not like them based on what I know about them (just what I've heard from him). Stuff like they are always asking to use my streaming logins but keep logging me out, when their dogs get old they abandon them at shelters so they can make room for new puppies...I do think that this kind of stuff bothers me BUT I think that even if it were my own friends making this housing request of me, I would tell them to get a hotel or stay at their parent's houses.\n\nEdit to add: my boyfriend lost both his parents young (when he was 16 and 22) and he doesn\u2019t have siblings or much extended family. He considers his friends from high school as his family. I am trying to be sensitive to his situation, because essentially he thinks that I should be more accommodating to his friends, since they are his family.", "created_utc": 1691434826, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ktof5/aita_for_not_letting_friends_from_out_of_town/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Him being \u201cdisappointed\u201d that you have boundaries is a biggie here. Right now: change all your streaming passwords and log everyone out. See how he reacts to that. That may help help moving forward. \n\nHugs.", "No, OP. Not the asshole and you should totally not agree with having them at your house.\n\nYou can calmly explain your boyfriend that while you understand and respect his loyalty and friendship feelings towards these people given the circumstances, you don\u2019t agree with their behavior towards him & much less towards you - a person they have never even met in real life.\n\nTheir request is inappropriate and exaggerated, and unwarranted, and it makes you feel uncomfortable and awkward that someone would even ask for such a \u201cfavour\u201d.\n\nThat you can\u2019t inconvenience your work schedule and find dog sitters in an unfamiliar area, just to allow a family of strangers to spend time at your house. That they are deeply inconsiderate even for asking , and for not having even offered to reimburse you. That familiarity should extend to your boyfriend only, not to you.\n\nThese and other aspects (such as, that accidents could happen at your house during their stay with their kids, and you absolutely do not want to have a problem on your hands) are sufficient for your boyfriend to understand . \n\nChange your streaming passwords and again tell him that while he is free to do as he wishes, you feel uncomfortable allowing strangers on a platform that hosts your card payment data, for ex. And that you don\u2019t owe explanations to or about persons you don\u2019t even know, you have never even seen in your life. \n\nMaybe your boyfriend will change his relationship with such \u201cfriends\u201d who are basically just moochers, but I doubt it. If you don\u2019t address this issue with him you may have bigger issues down the line, including privacy-related, financial, etc.", "Right. I can\u2019t even imagine. My wife and I have 5 dogs, 3 of whom are foster fails who got dumped themselves. I can\u2019t even imagine the kind of shit person who would do that and I definitely could never be friends with them and would seriously reconsider any relationships I have with people who maintain a relationship with them.", "Unfortunately, I know far too many examples of \"Having money doesn't mean having class.\"", "Exactly. BF is waving a huge red flag right there! \ud83d\udea9", "OP also states that the friends have family in town\u2026the friends should stay there.\n\nNTA. This friends and your boyfriend are pretty rude to think that you should completely change your very busy life around to accommodate them. These friends are strangers. I would never let a stranger live in my house.", "The plan is to live together once I\u2019m done with school (1.5 years left) because by then, I\u2019ll hopefully also just have 1 job and work more regular 9-5 hours", "Exactly. And why can't they stay at his house? Seriously?", "OMG!  Didn\u2019t think of this.  Absolutely.", "If he does it's high time for op to change the locks and do not give him a key", "Yeah I think my boyfriend is being taken advantage of sometimes. The last two times he saw these two was every few years, the parents want to take a vacation without their kids. So my boyfriend travels to their house (they don\u2019t reimburse his flight) and stays at their house to babysit while the parents go off on vacation. They say this is so that their kids can have quality time with their \u201cuncle\u201d. They know that my boyfriend doesn\u2019t have siblings or family of his own, and I feel like they are making him feel like and uncle just so they can get free childcare\u2026I might be being too negative here because I am annoyed with these people right now", "A year and a half", "I\u2019d definitely reevaluate things if I were you OP. If I was in your boyfriends shoes and my friends were asking my partner to give up their home that question wouldn\u2019t even come to you. I would\u2019ve shut it down instantly and reprimanded them for even asking. \n\nYou are NTA", "Hon, the only way you would be an asshole is to even consider, for a moment, giving into these demands. Don't be an asshole to yourself or to your dogs. Treat them like your family and tell them to get a hotel.", "OP I don\u2019t want to make any assumptions, but is it possible BF could use some therapy that includes assertiveness training? I genuinely hope he can unpack why he feels the need to earn and re-earn these people\u2019s friendship, because it\u2019s led to some seriously out of balance conclusions, and it\u2019s now impacting his main romantic relationship. \n\nYou are not in the wrong here. Clearly.", "Please don't waste more time in this relationship. Your boyfriend is showing you he doesn't care about your comfort and it will always be second to these people you have never met. That is not love.", "I\u2019ve suggested this as most of his friends (including the ones who live local to us) seem to take advantage of him. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand this is not normal. He just thinks my friends have a different dynamic and I don\u2019t understand his friend group. But I noticed his friends only reach out when they want him to buy their kids presents, or they need to borrow his truck\u2026\n\nHe refuses therapy. He doesn\u2019t believe in it. I can\u2019t get him to change his mind.", "NTA, but look at it this way. If your BF is resistant to therapy and thinks his dynamics with his friends are fine, let it be. BUT the second it affects you and makes you uncomfortable, you have every right to scream BOUNDARIES. He can do whatever he wants but he cannot dictate that you do what he wants."]}
