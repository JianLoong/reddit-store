{"id": 24115, "submission_id": "15ktof5", "title": "AITA for not letting friends from out of town stay at my home?", "selftext": "My (30F) boyfriend (35M) has 2 friends who live in another state, let's call them Jack and Liz. They want to come visit us in our state with their 4 children, ages ranging from 5-10. I live in the downtown area of our city while my boyfriend lives about 1 hour away in the suburbs. My house is close to where I go to school full-time (about a 5 minute walk) and also close to where I work (10 minute walk to my first job, 10 minute drive to my second job). I live with my 3 dogs and because of my busy schedule, I have a dog walker come everyday to feed and care for them. \n\nWhen Jack and Liz come to visit with their kids, they are asking to stay at my house. Here's the thing though, they want me to leave my house so that their family can stay there with complete privacy. I think it is also worth noting that I have never met or spoken to Jack and Liz before (they are my boyfriend's friends and not mine). Also, they are originally from our city, so they have their parents and family members who still live here. They seem pretty wealthy mostly because they tell my boyfriend that they are. Liz is a SAHM and has never worked before because Jack has had multiple inheritances from deceased family members and he brags about his high-paying job. They also own about 10 rental properties that they collect passive income from (believe they bought these houses with the inheritances). Before meeting Jack, Liz also did not work because her family is wealthy and supported her. \n\nThe thing is, my commute to work and school (I have one or both 7 days a week) is over an hour each way from my boyfriend's house in the suburbs. I already have such long days that changing my commute to be 2+ hours a day, even for a week, is giving me anxiety with all of the stuff I have going on between work and school. Also, I don't have anyone to walk my dogs at my boyfriend's house and even if I were to hire a dog walker, he doesn't want a stranger having access to enter his house. Finally, it would just be really uncomfortable to have to leave my own home and I am also nervous about having young children running around my house when I am not there and my home is not child proofed.\n\nSo, AITA? My boyfriend seems disappointed in me because I am not opening my home to his friends and I am already making a bad impression on them. He also thinks that I am doing this because I am deciding to not like them based on what I know about them (just what I've heard from him). Stuff like they are always asking to use my streaming logins but keep logging me out, when their dogs get old they abandon them at shelters so they can make room for new puppies...I do think that this kind of stuff bothers me BUT I think that even if it were my own friends making this housing request of me, I would tell them to get a hotel or stay at their parent's houses.\n\nEdit to add: my boyfriend lost both his parents young (when he was 16 and 22) and he doesn\u2019t have siblings or much extended family. He considers his friends from high school as his family. I am trying to be sensitive to his situation, because essentially he thinks that I should be more accommodating to his friends, since they are his family.\n\nEdit #2: regarding their past actions for their family pets, I find it absolutely abhorrent. When I\u2019ve brought it up, I\u2019ve been told that I am out of line because I don\u2019t have a family/children. My boyfriend thinks any criticism of their actions towards pets is a criticism of them as parents, which since I don\u2019t have kids, I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to voice opinions on stuff I don\u2019t know about. My boyfriend thinks that at least 2 of the abandoned dogs may be attributed towards PPD since they were both within a year of a baby being born. However, I feel like the fact that animal family members were the victims, this is still abhorrent behavior.", "created_utc": 1691434826, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ktof5/aita_for_not_letting_friends_from_out_of_town/", "score": 4953, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This makes no sense at all, in any way that's normal, kind, or good for you.\n\n*Here's the thing though, they want me to leave my house so that their family can stay there with complete privacy.*\n\n**Red flag Two:**  What about *your* privacy?  ***Where's the respect for you here***?  Based on how they try to lock you out of the streaming service *you* pay for, I'm wondering what else they would try to take from you, if they had privacy and access to more of your stuff.  I'm wondering if because taking your streaming service worked, they think they can take more from you, too.  Account numbers?  IDs?  \n\n**Red flag Three:**  What about the fact that they are asking you to leave your house for them?   **Normal people do not ask this.**  If you had offered it, that would be different, but you aren't offering.  They are asking.  \n\n *I think it is also worth noting that I have never met or spoken to Jack and Liz before (they are my boyfriend's friends and not mine).* \n\n**Red flag Four:**  **They are strangers to you.**  This makes no sense at all.\n\n*Also, they are originally from our city,* \n\n**Red Flag Five:**  so they know where to find the good hotels, B&Bs, etc.  \n\n*so they have their parents and family members who still live here.* \n\n**Red Flag Six:**   why aren't they asking to stay with their own family members and their own friends, instead of a stranger?  **What have they done** to these people's houses, **that no one else offers to let them stay with them**? \n\n*They seem pretty wealthy* \n\n**Red Flag Seven**:  either they are, and like to manipulate other people instead of paying their own expenses, or they aren't and are liars.\n\n**Red Flag Eight:**   **You cannot trust these people.**  They have already shown this.   *they are always asking to use my streaming logins but keep logging me out*   These people are users, manipulators.  **They steal your streaming service.**   \n\nBased just on this one red flag, ***I wouldn't let these people even visit in your house,*** and ***I would go change all your passwords on everything that your BF or these people might have access to***, ever.

Not reliable?  Cruel?  All of the above.  Again, ***they cannot be trusted.***  \n\n**Red Flag on your BF:**  he knows your commute would be terrible, if you did what he/they are asking.

WHY?  What does he get out of this?    Generally, someone that puts their wants ahead of your needs is someone that is likely to be abusive to you, eventually.   If this is a pattern of behavior for him, please rethink this relationship.  If it's the first time, maybe just take a break from seeing him while his friends are in town.

I wouldn't trust them around your purse, or your keys, or your information in your phone, or any banking cards you might have.\n\n*So, AITA?* \n\nNot at all.   They should never have asked this of you, not him, not his friends.

It's manipulative.***  How can he possibly justify their behaviors, and how they are treating you right now?\n\n*and I am already making a bad impression on them.* \n\nToo bad.

You have a right to protect yourself against such people.***  \n\n**I'd tell BF that you aren't discussing this with him again**.  If he persists, I'd tell him that he can talk to you again when they leave town.
