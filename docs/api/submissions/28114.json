When we moved in with each other years ago my wife and I shared tasks. She liked to take trash out and clean the bathroom. I organized things, did the bills, and cooking. The other tasks were picked up by who ever had free time. Yet over the last few months I have been struggling with the feeling I am the only grown adult in our home.\n   \nI am the one who cooks, does the bills, and now prompt any deep cleaning. If my wife does cleaning now she expects me to look at her work and tell her she did a good job. Almost like a kid wanted a gold star. Yet it\u2019s hard to give her that praise when the living room looks like a tornado hit. What finally made me snap was a planned trip (she had asked for) to go to my family\u2019s lake house. Before every trip she knows I like to clean up the house so we don\u2019t have to deal with it when we come back. Yet when I came home the house was a mess. Nothing was touched. \n  \nI hadn\u2019t expected a spotless house but at minimum dishes in the dishwasher or sink. Maybe trash set aside to go down or a load of wash ready for my work clothes. I explained my disappointment and frustration yet she didn\u2019t seem to understand. Instead she asked if we were still going to the lake or not.  I want to go to the lake house and said yes. So I started cleaning and after awhile she hopped in. Like her new normal she just cleaned the kitchen then laid back on the couch pulling up a phone app. I was still picking up trash around the house, gathering clothing for a wash at the cabin versus a wash when we got home, getting us packed, and grabbing snacks. I remember standing there as she spaced out. Not a care in the world for her while I was still busting butt to get us out the door. \n  \nAnd honestly\u2026 I snapped. I yelled at her about how she was lounging around while I worked. She yelled back how I didn\u2019t tell her what she needed to do which just pissed me off more. I went as far as yelled that I wasn\u2019t her adult to assign tasks or hold her hand. She was a big adult who could make choices. All during our ride she wouldn\u2019t talk to me and kept playing her phone app. Currently I am on the porch writing this while my wife is peppering me with so many questions that I could write a wiki walkthrough steps on how to use the microwave, where plates are, and how to heat her pizza. Mind you she has been in the cabin before and knows that I don\u2019t know this house that well either cause my family moves things constantly. Plus she is literally in her 30s and she can figure this out without me guiding her through.

The other main thing that stands out is your refusal to give praise for a job well done or an effort well made. There is a school of thought going around that you shouldn\u2019t say thanks or give praise for \u201cnormal tasks you\u2019d have to do anyway\u201d when in a relationship, but that lack of expressed appreciation or encouragement is hugely discouraging. Tell someone they did a good job when they did an OK job and you\u2019ll get an OK job again, at worst. Tell them nothing (or tell them it was inadequate), and you\u2019ll get a worse job or no job at all the next time. Basic human niceties go a long way. Finally, she asks you for instructions to do things and you are bitter about that. Clearly you have the alpha role. But if the beta gets zero encouragement and zero patience, don\u2019t expect them to improve. And never ever expect equality. It\u2019s impossible. Encourage your partner to be better in a kind and \u201cus\u201d way, not a tit-for-tat or competition way. Neither of you seems to be an asshole. Just bad at communicating needs, expectations, and encouragement.", "NTA\n\nI would be angry as well\n\nNot being funny has she been taking medication or recreational drugs.

So basically she does nothing and contributes nothing to the relationship.  Better and cheaper if you get rid of her now, and spend money on a hooker every now and then to satisfy your itch!", "ESH. She shouldn't be putting a majority of chores onto you and all the mental load of keeping track of chores. But you also shouldn't hold onto resentment until you snap and yell at your spouse.\n\nYou mention you both have ADHD and trouble designating chores, maybe try a family chore app? You can list all the chores, how frequently they need to be done, assign the tasks you each like to do, and rotate the chores that neither of you like to do. Some of the apps even give little \"rewards\" for completing tasks so you can make it a little competition to get the best score at the end of the week. Then there's no designating chores, the app tracks when chores have to be done, and it's up to each of you to check off your own tasks without someone being \"in charge\" of keeping track of what needs to be done.", "Could your partner be struggling with nuero divergent burn out? The impact on you is the same but you of all people should know that people with poor executive functioning are not lazy or not \u201cgrown ups\u201d.

So we use to divide by what do you like to do. I love to do numbers so bills fell to me. She loved cleaning grout so she took the bathroom. Everything else was body double or rock paper to get things done. Sometimes with work or personal stuff we help out if we notice something lacking. Yet I guess, as I stated to someone else, I been picking up a lot in the misc junk drawer of chores and letting her slide past with just the bathroom/kitchen chore. Just cause she was still cleaning, still helping. The trip I think just sort of tipped over my over filled plate of things to do.", "I am 100% in board with you are laying out. I have let a lot of things slide cause she let a lot of stuff slide for me. When I got my new job I stopped organizing our house and it became a mess. Yet I circled back and got us on track. So I was trying to give her the same space and time.  The praise thing is hard to explain. It isn\u2019t just go look and compliment. It\u2019s I have to walk into the bathroom, open everything, move the shower curtain, stand there for several minutes, and then give my approval. Mind you this is a tiny condo bathroom that you can take three steps in before you hit a wall. If I don\u2019t follow the steps of a full inspection, which I still don\u2019t think I know the whole rules or expectations of, she rolls her eyes and says \u201cyou didn\u2019t actually look\u201d. Then gets upset at me until I go back and look. Sometimes after a long day of work I can\u2019t do a full sweep and I tell her \u201cI just got home but this looks really good thank you\u201d. Yet that isn\u2019t allowed and I again get the eye roll. It\u2019s gotten to the point the inspection has to happen the moment I walk in the door from work.

Either cause of work or personal stuff.  Sometimes that we don\u2019t always discuss cause we are both very private people. It\u2019s why we clicked. Plus I honestly kept telling myself she was still cleaning, still helping in someway even if the praise thing was annoying.  Yet this trip set me off cause she just seemed to forget everything about me and wanted me to adult her through it.", "I thought of this idea a few weeks ago but it got in the mental dog piling of all the house chores. I will look back into it and see if I can find something I can ease us into.", "It could honestly be that. Yet I stated in another area all conversations have been falling flat. I ask her if she ok or something wrong and I get nothing. I tried little gifts and having dinner with movies we like to break the ice. Nothing. I offer fun things to do cause Halloween is our jam and she likes an idea then wants nothing to do with the event. I honestly feel like something is broken and I let it slide just hoping she talk to me. Maybe reach out when ready.", "As someone with ADHD as well, my partner and I have a conversation on what needs to be done and set time limits on when we'd like them done by. This way there's a routine and personal accountability instead of hoping your significant other will take initiative on their own - which is hard with ADHD, as you know.

Not that excuses her behaviour, but it adds a lot more information", "I get it. I do. Humor her with the inspection. Find something totally tiny and point it out and say how you really appreciate this specifically. Just an idea. Notice a tiny detail, as it demonstrates a detailed inspection and full appreciation. If she needs more (kids are like this \u2014 I know your complaint is she\u2019s not being particularly \u201cadult-like\u201d, but all adults have some kid in them, and thank God for that), give her more within reason. There IS only so much you can give, but it sounds like she\u2019s dying for your approval. That\u2019s not the worst thing. It can feel unbalanced, but it\u2019s charming in a way (as an outsider with my own experiences in similar veins). A related aside: My SO asks me fairly regularly what my favorite thing about her is. I don\u2019t always want to answer this, but I do. And I tell her something different every time. And it\u2019s always true. IDK how much that matters here, but your situation reminded me about this one in my relationship.", "As a person with ADHD, needing the praise is probably a way of getting the dopamine hit from cleaning that people without ADHD get from the cleaning itself.

Not that that makes her ta but it sounds like they haven't had a hard convo about this even though she's been feeling it for a while, based on comments.", "sugarmama", "Could she be burnt out? ADHD burnout is pretty awful and basically feels like literally everything is too hard. \nWhen is the last time you guys had a holiday with no responsibilities over your heads? \n\nAlso I've found that my meds (vy) don't work as well after a few years, and if I take a \"med break\" such as sleeping in on the weekend and not taking them so they don't keep me  up, it takes a few days for them to work properly again. \n\nIf you can afford it, I'd suggest a house keeper. \nOne day I'll get one and it'll be magical. \n\nDepending on how her mental health and medications are I'd be inclined to say ESH or NAH. \n\nIts understandable to feel resentful and angry when things feel unfair, but blowing up at her isn't necessarily the best way to deal with it.\nAnd if she's burnt out or depressed or her medication isn't working properly then she likely feels just as frustrated with herself as you do. \n\nWhen my burn out is bad i describe my life as \"chronically overwhelming\" and even buying groceries can require too much brain capacity. \n\nMaybe shelve the cleaning issue for now and enjoy your holiday and look at suggesting she see her doctor when you get home?", "There's no husband involved here.", "Communication is needed in any relationship. People are stupid by default.", "My son has ADHD and I have seen alot of improvement in him and myself (32 and I am struggling to remember what I am doing walking from one end of the house to the other) since I got magnetic whiteboard \"chore charts\". \n\nWhy not look into them, the ones I have are just flexible A3 magnets with a black background and white grids in different styles kids have \"my responsibilities\", I have, weekly menu, cleaning routine and family planner. They can be written on in chalk markers and have boxes for ticking once jobs are done.\n\nThe visual aid definitely helps our household, and there was even a \"freezer inventory\" one and a \"shopping list.\" You shouldn't need to do something like this for your partner, but it sounds like you could both benefit from it. There are even blank ones where you could write a \"pre vacation to do list\" so that you can make a list of everything that needs to be done before you leave and all your partner has to do is look at it and cross tasks off as they do them so that when you get home you can see what else has to be done and start helping to get out of there faster.\n\nI'm not going to give a judgement because while your outburst is understandable, this whole dynamic should have been handled along time ago with a serious discussion and maybe therapy is needed, is your partner medicated and if yes, could their meds need adjusting, or is there a deeper issue going on with them that maybe you are unaware of.", "That\u2019s a HUGE BTW to drop after your pot. YTA for simply excluding this information.\n\nYou BOTH need to see your Drs ASAP.", "i have ADHD as well and struggle with cleaning. you two definitely need a physical \u201cchore chart\u201d or cleaning checklist somewhere you\u2019ll always see it. there\u2019s also cleaning/chore apps like Sweepy that are great for reminders and having a clear list of what needs to be done and who is doing it.", "How do you reverse the genders when they're both women?", "WI is mentioned in the very first comment. Quit whining about nothing.", "*She said. They're both women.", "Thank you that explains it but she needs to manage it better but she might be experiencing burn out. Just a suggestion. Theirs ways round everything she just needs to recognise that. Then we're tired more tired than non adhd people. Rejection sensitivity\n\nPlus it all depends on the tone of whomever is pointing out all the stuff, that she said and I'm sure she wants to be able too do it, sounds like she needs to make a plan and rest and devide her have to do list with want too do list and make sure she eats basic good diet and routine and personal discipline and therapy is good pointers for anyone experiencing. I'm still learning too.\n\nI don't blame him for having his feelings I'm sure he's tired and when no one's doing their bit. We all can get snappy.", "My bank account is never remotely close to be empty so I am never worried about when bills are charged.", "It could still be burn out. Conversations are exhausting and I turn into a complete hermit because any interaction is just too draining (and then I convince myself everyone hates me cause they don't reach out anymore, yay RSD) \n\nYou know your wife, so what works for me or others may not work for her, but in my case even taking care of myself is too hard, I'll just go to bed rather than making food etc, so practical acts such as bringing me a plate of food are a good way to reach me through the brain fog.", "I have some thoughts. First of all, you should both sit down and have an open, loving conversation. Everyone in here saying she is weaponizing incompetence have zero compassion. This is your wife, you presumably love her, but her behaviour is screaming that she's struggling. Please start there. \n\nDoom/dopamine scrolling on the couch when you're trying to clean - she's probably overwhelmed and is having to check out. Most likely she's internally screaming at herself to do something - anything - but she's stuck. I call it couch-locked. It isn't voluntary. \n\nIf she's falling behind on her responsibilities at home, it could be that she's experiencing burnout. You said the home has fallen behind - lemme tell you, I can keep the house tidy if it's slightly disorganized. But there comes a point when even glancing at a huge mess makes my brain shut down. Overwhelm. \n\nPraise? Guess what - some folks need/want praise. If she's having a hard time, getting some praise helps to keep her moving forward. A reward, to help stimulate some dopamine and be able to continue. I know ADHD folks who get a bit of a boost when the job is done, but most don't. So if praise is her go-button, why in the world would you withhold that?? \n\nAnother thought - hormones. Based on her age it's a bit early for perimenopause but not unheard of. Hormones plus ADHD is a fucking nightmare. Her meds might not be as effective. She should talk with her doctor ASAP. \n\nYou also don't talk much about the other factors in her life. What else is on her plate that's exhausting her? How is your intimacy? (Not sex, rather emotional intimacy). How is your marriage outside of this issue? Because your post sounds pretty resentful and condescending. If that's coming across in your interactions, that's going to trigger RSD and she'll shut down further, especially if she's someone who thrives on praise. \n\nYou're her partner. You should be looking for compassionate, constructive ways to help her meet you in the middle. Please try harder.", "ADHD is a diagnosed disability with real symptoms. She has a responsibility to address them as best she can. But sure if he can\u2019t tolerate it they should separate. But it\u2019s not laziness. It\u2019s laziness on your part to fail to understand what ADHD does to the brain.", "No. lol A sugar mama is a wealthy lady who pays for a partner. In this case, he\u2019s a sugar daddy. She\u2019s maybe a sugar baby\u2026?", "Not me over here making assumptions and missing relevant details lol", "Yes, and then the next comment is stopping just short of blaming OP entirely lol", "read again. they are both women. no guy here. op is sugarmama", "She sounds like she\u2019s drifting into dysfunction. \n\nFrom other comments, it seems like she\u2019s not working. The lack of an outside schedule always made me messier, more prone to dopamine chasing in games/social media, and less engaged with the outside world.\n\nOP, please remember that someone who is a good partner will try to be healthy. They will be honest about what they can and cannot do. They will take your feelings seriously and work with you for solutions.\n\nIt\u2019s not about her being 100% perfect, it\u2019s about being engaged and present. If she refuses to do that, you can say that you can\u2019t stay in the relationship. You\u2019re not ditching a vulnerable person; you\u2019re leaving a relationship with no partner.", "Except \"What if he's neurodivergent?\" also comes up in every post about a man not pulling his weight when it comes to household chores in hetero couples so you're not making any point at all.", "Well shit. \ud83d\ude06 My bad.", "Why did you ask about the breaks?

If you stop drinking coffee for a week, you feel more energy from it the next week.", "Ah ok. My doctor knew I didn\u2019t take it on the weekends and seemed fine with it, but I\u2019m always open to hearing what other people have experienced and asking her about it if it seems relevant.
