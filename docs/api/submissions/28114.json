When we moved in with each other years ago my wife and I shared tasks. She liked to take trash out and clean the bathroom. I organized things, did the bills, and cooking. The other tasks were picked up by who ever had free time. Yet over the last few months I have been struggling with the feeling I am the only grown adult in our home.\n   \nI am the one who cooks, does the bills, and now prompt any deep cleaning. If my wife does cleaning now she expects me to look at her work and tell her she did a good job. Almost like a kid wanted a gold star. Yet it\u2019s hard to give her that praise when the living room looks like a tornado hit. What finally made me snap was a planned trip (she had asked for) to go to my family\u2019s lake house. Before every trip she knows I like to clean up the house so we don\u2019t have to deal with it when we come back. Yet when I came home the house was a mess. Nothing was touched. \n  \nI hadn\u2019t expected a spotless house but at minimum dishes in the dishwasher or sink. Maybe trash set aside to go down or a load of wash ready for my work clothes. I explained my disappointment and frustration yet she didn\u2019t seem to understand. Instead she asked if we were still going to the lake or not.  I want to go to the lake house and said yes. So I started cleaning and after awhile she hopped in. Like her new normal she just cleaned the kitchen then laid back on the couch pulling up a phone app. I was still picking up trash around the house, gathering clothing for a wash at the cabin versus a wash when we got home, getting us packed, and grabbing snacks. I remember standing there as she spaced out. Not a care in the world for her while I was still busting butt to get us out the door. \n  \nAnd honestly\u2026 I snapped. I yelled at her about how she was lounging around while I worked. She yelled back how I didn\u2019t tell her what she needed to do which just pissed me off more. I went as far as yelled that I wasn\u2019t her adult to assign tasks or hold her hand. She was a big adult who could make choices. All during our ride she wouldn\u2019t talk to me and kept playing her phone app. Currently I am on the porch writing this while my wife is peppering me with so many questions that I could write a wiki walkthrough steps on how to use the microwave, where plates are, and how to heat her pizza. Mind you she has been in the cabin before and knows that I don\u2019t know this house that well either cause my family moves things constantly. Plus she is literally in her 30s and she can figure this out without me guiding her through.

The other main thing that stands out is your refusal to give praise for a job well done or an effort well made. There is a school of thought going around that you shouldn\u2019t say thanks or give praise for \u201cnormal tasks you\u2019d have to do anyway\u201d when in a relationship, but that lack of expressed appreciation or encouragement is hugely discouraging. Tell someone they did a good job when they did an OK job and you\u2019ll get an OK job again, at worst. Tell them nothing (or tell them it was inadequate), and you\u2019ll get a worse job or no job at all the next time. Basic human niceties go a long way. Finally, she asks you for instructions to do things and you are bitter about that. Clearly you have the alpha role. But if the beta gets zero encouragement and zero patience, don\u2019t expect them to improve. And never ever expect equality. It\u2019s impossible. Encourage your partner to be better in a kind and \u201cus\u201d way, not a tit-for-tat or competition way. Neither of you seems to be an asshole. Just bad at communicating needs, expectations, and encouragement.", "NTA\n\nI would be angry as well\n\nNot being funny has she been taking medication or recreational drugs.

So basically she does nothing and contributes nothing to the relationship.  Better and cheaper if you get rid of her now, and spend money on a hooker every now and then to satisfy your itch!", "ESH. She shouldn't be putting a majority of chores onto you and all the mental load of keeping track of chores. But you also shouldn't hold onto resentment until you snap and yell at your spouse.\n\nYou mention you both have ADHD and trouble designating chores, maybe try a family chore app? You can list all the chores, how frequently they need to be done, assign the tasks you each like to do, and rotate the chores that neither of you like to do. Some of the apps even give little \"rewards\" for completing tasks so you can make it a little competition to get the best score at the end of the week. Then there's no designating chores, the app tracks when chores have to be done, and it's up to each of you to check off your own tasks without someone being \"in charge\" of keeping track of what needs to be done.", "Could your partner be struggling with nuero divergent burn out? The impact on you is the same but you of all people should know that people with executive functioning are not lazy or not \u201cgrown ups\u201d.

So we use to divide by what do you like to do. I love to do numbers so bills fell to me. She loved cleaning grout so she took the bathroom. Everything else was body double or rock paper to get things done. Sometimes with work or personal stuff we help out if we notice something lacking. Yet I guess, as I stated to someone else, I been picking up a lot in the misc junk drawer of chores and letting her slide past with just the bathroom/kitchen chore. Just cause she was still cleaning, still helping. The trip I think just sort of tipped over my over filled plate of things to do.", "I am 100% in board with you are laying out. I have let a lot of things slide cause she let a lot of stuff slide for me. When I got my new job I stopped organizing our house and it became a mess. Yet I circled back and got us on track. So I was trying to give her the same space and time.  The praise thing is hard to explain. It isn\u2019t just go look and compliment. It\u2019s I have to walk into the bathroom, open everything, move the shower curtain, stand there for several minutes, and then give my approval. Mind you this is a tiny condo bathroom that you can take three steps in before you hit a wall. If I don\u2019t follow the steps of a full inspection, which I still don\u2019t think I know the whole rules or expectations of, she rolls her eyes and says \u201cyou didn\u2019t actually look\u201d. Then gets upset at me until I go back and look. Sometimes after a long day of work I can\u2019t do a full sweep and I tell her \u201cI just got home but this looks really good thank you\u201d. Yet that isn\u2019t allowed and I again get the eye roll. It\u2019s gotten to the point the inspection has to happen the moment I walk in the door from work.

Either cause of work or personal stuff.  Sometimes that we don\u2019t always discuss cause we are both very private people. It\u2019s why we clicked. Plus I honestly kept telling myself she was still cleaning, still helping in someway even if the praise thing was annoying.  Yet this trip set me off cause she just seemed to forget everything about me and wanted me to adult her through it.", "I thought of this idea a few weeks ago but it got in the mental dog piling of all the house chores. I will look back into it and see if I can find something I can ease us into.", "It could honestly be that. Yet I stated in another area all conversations have been falling flat. I ask her if she ok or something wrong and I get nothing. I tried little gifts and having dinner with movies we like to break the ice. Nothing. I offer fun things to do cause Halloween is our jam and she likes an idea then wants nothing to do with the event. I honestly feel like something is broken and I let it slide just hoping she talk to me. Maybe reach out when ready.", "As someone with ADHD as well, my partner and I have a conversation on what needs to be done and set time limits on when we'd like them done by. This way there's a routine and personal accountability instead of hoping your significant other will take initiative on their own - which is hard with ADHD, as you know.

Not that excuses her behaviour, but it adds a lot more information", "I get it. I do. Humor her with the inspection. Find something totally tiny and point it out and say how you really appreciate this specifically. Just an idea. Notice a tiny detail, as it demonstrates a detailed inspection and full appreciation. If she needs more (kids are like this \u2014 I know your complaint is she\u2019s not being particularly \u201cadult-like\u201d, but all adults have some kid in them, and thank God for that), give her more within reason. There IS only so much you can give, but it sounds like she\u2019s dying for your approval. That\u2019s not the worst thing. It can feel unbalanced, but it\u2019s charming in a way (as an outsider with my own experiences in similar veins). A related aside: My SO asks me fairly regularly what my favorite thing about her is. I don\u2019t always want to answer this, but I do. And I tell her something different every time. And it\u2019s always true. IDK how much that matters here, but your situation reminded me about this one in my relationship.", "As a person with ADHD, needing the praise is probably a way of getting the dopamine hit from cleaning that people without ADHD get from the cleaning itself.

It sounds like, with the little information provided, that your wife wants to please you only slightly less than she wants to deal with your ire at her perceived failures. \n\nThe classic - nothing I do is good enough, so why try.\n\nYou should get some help dealing with your frustration and slowly, over time, help your wife understand your expectations and perspectives. \n\nIn this issue, you are TA, but not for expecting her to behave like your version of a good adult, but your obvious lack of patience and understanding.", "NTA, having a adult child for a spouse sucks. I highly recommend counseling and if that doesn't help, get out while you can and won't have to pay much if any alimony. Definitely do NOT get her pregnant.", "Its not worth getting angry over just hire a maid for before trips.", "She may be looking for you to lead and let her know what you want her to do. Yes, she can be an adult, but it sounds like she wants to you to set expectations. If you had said \"Yes, we can go to the lake house if the house is cleaned when I get home\", she most likely would have put effort into it. Try giving her tasks to complete and then see how she responds. If you are still working on something then suggest one or two other things to get done.", "NTA seems she is not communicating which is honestly more like being an adult than cleaning. Otherwise I would say maybe you just have different standards of living. Maybe she really doesn\u2019t mind the mess and prefers her free time instead of s clean house while you don\u2019t. Then I guess I you would have to compromise somehow.", "This happened to me after I got married. Equally splitting the chores for *years* then they have the ring on their finger and bam!

Why do adults need to have convos constantly about cleaning. The wife was the one that stopped cleaning, threw a tantrum, no is playing victim.

Do you criticize how your partner cleans? Mine told me once I am doing a particular chore badly (I still hold it was undeserved, and was probably caused by them being stressed), and ten years later I sometimes still need their assurance I am doing this specific thing correctly. Also, there is nothing wrong with asking for an outside take for how well something is cleaned, nothing childish in it per se.\n\nAnyways... you need a list, a timeline and probably reminders set.
