When we moved in with each other years ago my wife and I shared tasks. She liked to take trash out and clean the bathroom. I organized things, did the bills, and cooking. The other tasks were picked up by who ever had free time. Yet over the last few months I have been struggling with the feeling I am the only grown adult in our home.\n   \nI am the one who cooks, does the bills, and now prompt any deep cleaning. If my wife does cleaning now she expects me to look at her work and tell her she did a good job. Almost like a kid wanted a gold star. Yet it\u2019s hard to give her that praise when the living room looks like a tornado hit. What finally made me snap was a planned trip (she had asked for) to go to my family\u2019s lake house. Before every trip she knows I like to clean up the house so we don\u2019t have to deal with it when we come back. Yet when I came home the house was a mess. Nothing was touched. \n  \nI hadn\u2019t expected a spotless house but at minimum dishes in the dishwasher or sink. Maybe trash set aside to go down or a load of wash ready for my work clothes. I explained my disappointment and frustration yet she didn\u2019t seem to understand. Instead she asked if we were still going to the lake or not.  I want to go to the lake house and said yes. So I started cleaning and after awhile she hopped in. Like her new normal she just cleaned the kitchen then laid back on the couch pulling up a phone app. I was still picking up trash around the house, gathering clothing for a wash at the cabin versus a wash when we got home, getting us packed, and grabbing snacks. I remember standing there as she spaced out. Not a care in the world for her while I was still busting butt to get us out the door. \n  \nAnd honestly\u2026 I snapped. I yelled at her about how she was lounging around while I worked. She yelled back how I didn\u2019t tell her what she needed to do which just pissed me off more. I went as far as yelled that I wasn\u2019t her adult to assign tasks or hold her hand. She was a big adult who could make choices. All during our ride she wouldn\u2019t talk to me and kept playing her phone app. Currently I am on the porch writing this while my wife is peppering me with so many questions that I could write a wiki walkthrough steps on how to use the microwave, where plates are, and how to heat her pizza. Mind you she has been in the cabin before and knows that I don\u2019t know this house that well either cause my family moves things constantly. Plus she is literally in her 30s and she can figure this out without me guiding her through. Am I the asshole for wanting my wife to act like the adult I loved and married?", "created_utc": 1696299998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yg1hp/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_be_an_adult/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should not have to dictate what another adult should do to contribute to a household, that is even more MENTAL LABOUR placed on the already exhausted partner.\n\nNTA. Your wife is 100% the ahole!", "NTA \n\nBut...snapping will hurt your ability to get your message across. You have to stay calm and just use your words. \n\nMy suggestion is to apologizing for losing your cool. Explain again that your need to run your house as a team. Ask her what she thinks she can do more of and how she wants to communicate the responsibilities.", "NTA\n\nBut, with respect, you both need to work on your communication. I had a similar situation with a girlfriend i lived with. It was really hard to explain to her what I needed, and she never understood. It was always EASIER to just ignore the problem and do it myself. In the end I resented her though and it strained our relationship.\n\nI forgot that she wasn't me and that if I didn't find a way to get her to understand what I was going through, then it was rediculous for me to just expect her to know what I was feeling and modify her behavior accordingly \n\nI have no doubt that you are aware of this already, but while this may seem trivial, at its core these are foundational issues with your relationship\n\nMarital counseling can help you navigate this together.

So outside of you snapping and yelling..have you ever had an actual conversation about dividing responsibilities? Asked for her to do more? Really anything other than flying off the handle?", "NTA with caveats. A few things. One, this isn\u2019t new and it\u2019s behavior you let slide for a LONG time. You have some culpability in that. The other main thing that stands out is your refusal to give praise for a job well done or an effort well made. There is a school of thought going around that you shouldn\u2019t say thanks or give praise for \u201cnormal tasks you\u2019d have to do anyway\u201d when in a relationship, but that lack of expressed appreciation or encouragement is hugely discouraging. Tell someone they did a good job when they did an OK job and you\u2019ll get an OK job again, at worst. Tell them nothing (or tell them it was inadequate), and you\u2019ll get a worse job or no job at all the next time. Basic human niceties go a long way. Finally, she asks you for instructions to do things and you are bitter about that. Clearly you have the alpha role. But if the beta gets zero encouragement and zero patience, don\u2019t expect them to improve. And never ever expect equality. It\u2019s impossible. Encourage your partner to be better in a kind and \u201cus\u201d way, not a tit-for-tat or competition way. Neither of you seems to be an asshole. Just bad at communicating needs, expectations, and encouragement.", "NTA\n\nI would be angry as well\n\nNot being funny has she been taking medication or recreational drugs. From what you describe she sounds like she is out of it most of the time!", "I\u2019m feeling as if ESH, but mostly because nobody seems to be able to communicate.\n\nBut, as so often, my first reaction is: get a cleaning service!\n\nWell, either that or get a divorce; honestly, I\u2019m not feeling a whole of love here.", "YTA\nThese are concerning signs and instead of asking if your wife is okay you scream. She is \u201cspacing out\u201d and yet you yell. She is acting different and yet you decide to have a temper tantrum. \nGod forbid YOU grow up and ask if everything is okay before you fly off into a rage.", "So, your wife\u2019s behavior has changed in ways that you find concerning and upsetting, and seemingly without explanation.

So basically she does nothing and contributes nothing to the relationship.  Better and cheaper if you get rid of her now, and spend money on a hooker every now and then to satisfy your itch!", "ESH. She shouldn't be putting a majority of chores onto you and all the mental load of keeping track of chores. But you also shouldn't hold onto resentment until you snap and yell at your spouse.\n\nYou mention you both have ADHD and trouble designating chores, maybe try a family chore app? You can list all the chores, how frequently they need to be done, assign the tasks you each like to do, and rotate the chores that neither of you like to do. Some of the apps even give little \"rewards\" for completing tasks so you can make it a little competition to get the best score at the end of the week. Then there's no designating chores, the app tracks when chores have to be done, and it's up to each of you to check off your own tasks without someone being \"in charge\" of keeping track of what needs to be done.", "Could your partner be struggling with nuero divergent burn out? The impact on you is the same but you of all people should know that people with executive functioning are not lazy or not \u201cgrown ups\u201d. Talk to her, be compassionate, seek a solution together.", "To be truthful we both have ADHD and we setting hard boundaries on whose chores is whose has led to issues before. So we use to divide by what do you like to do. I love to do numbers so bills fell to me. She loved cleaning grout so she took the bathroom. Everything else was body double or rock paper to get things done. Sometimes with work or personal stuff we help out if we notice something lacking. Yet I guess, as I stated to someone else, I been picking up a lot in the misc junk drawer of chores and letting her slide past with just the bathroom/kitchen chore. Just cause she was still cleaning, still helping. The trip I think just sort of tipped over my over filled plate of things to do.", "I am 100% in board with you are laying out. I have let a lot of things slide cause she let a lot of stuff slide for me. When I got my new job I stopped organizing our house and it became a mess. Yet I circled back and got us on track. So I was trying to give her the same space and time.  The praise thing is hard to explain. It isn\u2019t just go look and compliment. It\u2019s I have to walk into the bathroom, open everything, move the shower curtain, stand there for several minutes, and then give my approval. Mind you this is a tiny condo bathroom that you can take three steps in before you hit a wall. If I don\u2019t follow the steps of a full inspection, which I still don\u2019t think I know the whole rules or expectations of, she rolls her eyes and says \u201cyou didn\u2019t actually look\u201d. Then gets upset at me until I go back and look. Sometimes after a long day of work I can\u2019t do a full sweep and I tell her \u201cI just got home but this looks really good thank you\u201d. Yet that isn\u2019t allowed and I again get the eye roll. It\u2019s gotten to the point the inspection has to happen the moment I walk in the door from work.  I must give her that gold star and I been really trying but I been struggling. Maybe I was wrong letting that slide to but there is only so much I can handle.", "(Replied to myself. Comment moved.)", "Lately it honestly feels like she has been. I been really sort of ignoring it cause she is my other half. Hoping that will she would talk to me cause most days she just doesn\u2019t want to talk. I start a conversation and it lands flat. I don\u2019t know if she is taking a new med or not. She takes ADHD meds for years now but I only have seen that effect her sleep cycles.", "Honestly I was holding out hope cause our teamwork has always shifted and found new patterns. Either cause of work or personal stuff.  Sometimes that we don\u2019t always discuss cause we are both very private people. It\u2019s why we clicked. Plus I honestly kept telling myself she was still cleaning, still helping in someway even if the praise thing was annoying.  Yet this trip set me off cause she just seemed to forget everything about me and wanted me to adult her through it.", "I thought of this idea a few weeks ago but it got in the mental dog piling of all the house chores. I will look back into it and see if I can find something I can ease us into.", "It could honestly be that. Yet I stated in another area all conversations have been falling flat. I ask her if she ok or something wrong and I get nothing. I tried little gifts and having dinner with movies we like to break the ice. Nothing. I offer fun things to do cause Halloween is our jam and she likes an idea then wants nothing to do with the event. I honestly feel like something is broken and I let it slide just hoping she talk to me. Maybe reach out when ready.", "As someone with ADHD as well, my partner and I have a conversation on what needs to be done and set time limits on when we'd like them done by. This way there's a routine and personal accountability instead of hoping your significant other will take initiative on their own - which is hard with ADHD, as you know. If I know I am going to struggle to remember to do the task, I set reminders in my phone. You can't expect someone else to run on your expectations if it's not discussed.", "I'd add this to your original post OP so you get tailored advice rather than people just assuming she is just a lazy person. Not that excuses her behaviour, but it adds a lot more information", "I get it. I do. Humor her with the inspection. Find something totally tiny and point it out and say how you really appreciate this specifically. Just an idea. Notice a tiny detail, as it demonstrates a detailed inspection and full appreciation. If she needs more (kids are like this \u2014 I know your complaint is she\u2019s not being particularly \u201cadult-like\u201d, but all adults have some kid in them, and thank God for that), give her more within reason. There IS only so much you can give, but it sounds like she\u2019s dying for your approval. That\u2019s not the worst thing. It can feel unbalanced, but it\u2019s charming in a way (as an outsider with my own experiences in similar veins). A related aside: My SO asks me fairly regularly what my favorite thing about her is. I don\u2019t always want to answer this, but I do. And I tell her something different every time. And it\u2019s always true. IDK how much that matters here, but your situation reminded me about this one in my relationship.", "As a person with ADHD, needing the praise is probably a way of getting the dopamine hit from cleaning that people without ADHD get from the cleaning itself. Just do it. She\u2019s your life partner. I don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s so hard for you.", "You need to ask the question, either the Doctors have changed her meds or she is taking something she shouldn't be", "My ex-wife became like this. Irresponsible, distracted, spaced out, and on her phone all the time. She had been a fantastic driver, and then started coming home with unexplained dents and dings in the car. Turns out she was abusing the Dexedrine prescribed for her ADHD, as well as other meds she pilfered in her work as a psychiatric aide and nursing student.\n\nI hope this isn\u2019t the case with your wife, but your description of her behaviour is uncomfortably familiar. I wish I had advice for you other than to talk all of this over with her and/or a counsellor. If she is abusing substances you will need some external support to help protect your own mental health. (Even if she is not abusing a therapist or counsellor may help you.)\n\nI wish you both the best.", ">I been really sort of ignoring it cause she is my other half\n\nJust a thought, but real partners hold each other accountable. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t give her slack or broach it in a nice way, but ignoring things in a partnership generally leads to resentment and failure, whether a marriage, business, etc.", "Those are all really lovely things to do and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re exhausted from trying to figure it out. You said in another comment that you\u2019re both really private people. That doesn\u2019t work in a marriage. You need to be direct without being accusatory. For example, \u201cBabe, you haven\u2019t been yourself for a few months now. I\u2019ve tried everything I can to be there for you but this can\u2019t go on. You need to either talk to me or talk to a therapist but somethings got to give. I\u2019m not happy and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re happy either\u201d.", "I honestly until your post not thought about it but a few months ago I noticed a new dent in her car. She told me she forgot to mention it to me that she got hit at work and would look into getting it fixed. It been a few months now and she hasn\u2019t gotten it fixed or even quoted. I will look therapy for both of us. Even if it isn\u2019t addiction I think it be best for both of us.", "I agree that therapy is a good start. Good luck to the both of you!", "She also could have stopped or had an increase in meds.", "I would also get her into her primary care physician and get a full work up done, including a toxicology screening to make sure nothing is medically wrong with her."]}
