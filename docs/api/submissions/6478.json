You didn't make him break his monitor, he did that all by himself.", "NTA. Your parents are coddling your brother, who is absolutely old enough to better control his anger. Maybe not having a monitor for a while will teach him a lesson. You should also suggest your parents put him in therapy.", "NTA. Everyone else sucks\n\nHe sucks for being unable to control his emotions. The parents suck for not putting him into therapy and enabling the behavior, and ignoring your needs to be able to sleep.", "NTA. Your parents are the true assholes here. Their stance of \"ignore it and it will go away\" is just plain shitty parenting. You weren't being a third parent by going to address your brother's behavior, you were being the ONLY parent in that house. \n\nThe fact that your brother actually believes that it isn't his fault that he is having what are essentially rage tantrums, is proof of just how shitty your parents are. If he truly cannot control his outbursts, they need to get him help. Telling everyone to ignore the fact that this kid needs some sort of mental/medical intervention is just plain child neglect on their part. \n\nIf you have access to some sort of counselling program through school or even a community outreach group, I would suggest you take advantage. You definitely need to be able to talk to a reasonable adult who can help you navigate this until you can get out of that house. \n\nI am sorry that your parents are so shitty and aren't doing their job. But, you are in no way to blame for any of this. You don't owe your brother a montior. But, I would be very careful about keeping your room locked. Since your parents don't believe in actual parenting, I'm sure if he breaks or steals your monitor, they won't do anything about it. They will most likely tell you to \"sort it out\" yourselves again. Seriously, though. Your parents suck. And you can tell them a stranger on the internet said that.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is in full control of his actions and broke it himself. Tell him to have some self-control and dignity, or if he has an actual issue go see a psychologist.

First they get mad at you for \u201cdealing with it yourself\u201d and now they\u2019re putting their hands up and walking away because it\u2019s too messy for them. They need to decide if they\u2019re going to be the parent figures or not because it seems like they\u2019re wishy washy with their duties.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are the big assholes here, raising an even bigger asshole. \n\n\"There's nothing we can do\". Yes there is. Therapy exists. Even if your family is short on funds, schools will help you with these things if your parents bring it up with administrators. They will find low cost-free therapists for your brother to visit and work through his anger issues. \n\n\nYour parents are setting your brother up for failure and anyone who encounters him is in for a tough time. \n\n\nHe's blaming *you* for something *he* did. It's not your fault, OP. You don't control his actions. He does. You had to step in as a third parent because your parents are refusing to help what could potentially be a very fatal problem. \n\n\nThis is a huge ticking time bomb. What happens when your brother grows up and meets someone? What happens when he moves in with someone who won't tolerate the ruckus and the outbursts? Holes in walls? Screaming matches? Physical violence? This needs to be nipped in the bud ASAP, and your parents aren't taking the necessary steps. Instead they've all but given up on it and have convinced your brother he's not responsible for his actions. \n\n\nBut to reiterate, this isn't your fault, OP. None of it is.", "NTA. And don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you are in any way to blame. This is 100% on himself and your parents are enabling it. Is there someone you can confide in like a school counselor or something? Because this seems like a toxic environment for you and your sisters to live in.", "NTA.\n\nNo matter what happened with his monitor, your brother would be TA by making so much noise during sleeping hours.\n\nHe bears full responsibility for his actions, including acting so impulsively that he broke his own property. This is literally 100% on him.", "Uh, your brother needs therapy. Something is wrong here.", "Your parents are TA and not only refusing to find your brother help but settin up an atmosphere where it is the norm for everyone to suffer for your brother.

You did NOT \u201cmake\u201d your brother break his monitor!  That\u2019s entirely on him.  And it\u2019s frankly ridiculous that your parents fault you in any way.  You weren\u2019t \u201cparenting\u201d him, you were simply doing what your parents are now asking you to do\u2014trying to \u201cwork out\u201d something with your brother.  Have to say, your parents aren\u2019t parenting.  They\u2019ve contributed to your brother believing he isn\u2019t responsible for his own feelings and actions.  Try telling that to the judicial system! (Gosh, I only hit him/destroyed someone else\u2019s property because they did X, which triggered me!) your parents are handicapping your brother by accepting his unacceptable behavior, with the entire family walking on eggshells.  At 17, your brother can seek therapy to deal with his personal issues.  In any event, none of this is your problem/fault.", "NTA. Your brother has anger issues. What's worse is that your parents seem to lack the understanding to do something about it. Your bro is probably playing competitive online games and getting pissed he isn't as good as he thinks he is. His uncontrolled anger might not be his fault (just guessing he wasn't taught how to handle his emotions) but he is bringing out the worst in himself by repeatedly playing a game that he can't control his emotions while playing. At 17, he now needs to figure out his anger himself unfortunately. Your parents are so nonchalant about this it's concerning. He broke the monitor because he acts like a toddler when he loses at games. Not your problem. That's on him and hopefully you can convince your parents his reactions to video games are not normal, it's toxic.", "No it's not your fault that he did that. You are all teens this happens.\n\nBut your brother has behavioural issues, and everyone else is stressed to balls with this going on.\n\nSo your parents need to be the firm zone for normal behaviour, and enforce that within reason. Yes he is 17 but that's not an adult yet and if everyone else is suffering then well they have to be the ones to enforce things like screen time management.\n\nHe can play games and rant and rave all he wants, but 1am is too late, no one needs that in their life.\n\nThat means internet restrictions with it cutting out at 00:00, he can play an offline game if he wants but they are way less likely to make him that pissed.\n\nHe ultimately needs to recognise he is in need of help and find a better outlet, physical sports, art, music, even a trip to a rage room.\n\nAnd what causes things like anger issues can be very varied and even a very deep rooted fear.\n\nHell I had anger issues then I found out it was a very deep personal image issue, I hated myself so much it just permaited everything.\n\nAs for the monitor issue, you should always knock, admittedly at that point it would be a kick from me but hey. That may be one part of why he is angry at you coming in. But no if he has aim that bad then a new monitor won't help! :D\n\nSeriously tho just giving him it means you don't have one to study, entertain yourself privately in your room in a way that doesn't interfere with others. And a brake of a few days may just be what he needs. (Also look at pin locking screens in the house, its a fairly common feature.)", "Study, work, save, move out.", "NTA! You did nothing wrong. He should get help from a specialist, your parents should try to help him as well bc this is not normal. And you shouldn't give him your monitor, he broke his and his fault if he lost the game.", "NTA, I would have said you're NTA even if it were you that smashed your disrespectful brothers monitor.", "This is an obvious NTA situation.  \n\nJust a couple of thoughts though:  \n\nGamers can be intense, but even for hardcore gamers this is NOT normal behavior.  \n\nYour parents have exactly zero control of the situation.  \n\nAnger issues don't resolve on their own.  \n\nThis is a classic manipulation on his part -- \"***I*** don't have the problem, ***you*** are actually the one that caused this.\"  He may not be a manipulator now, but this is how it starts.  Incidents such as these are going to give him the training *and permission* to be abusive later in life (incorrect reinforcement, he manipulates and everyone else caves, so in his mind it becomes easy to convince himself he's right).\n\nI HATE telling people to disregard their parents.  But in this case, you have two younger siblings to consider.  Even if it is ineffective at changing the behavior, drawing a line in the sand and saying \"this is unacceptable behavior\" sets the proper standard for your sisters.", "NTA your parents are completely enabling his anger issues rather than dealing with it!!

Why is he even playing games if it just enable his anger issues...", "NTA. That you could possibly believe you are the asshole here reflects just as poorly on your parents' parenting skills/method as everything else in this story.

Your younger siblings must be affected by the noise as well as you.", "NTA! This is absolutely insane and goes way deeper than just video games. If playing gets him that upset and angry, he needs some seriously counseling before his anger turns to other things! They are enabling this behavior.", "NTA besides the behavioral issues and option should be soundproofing like YT creators you shouldn\u2019t pay for his issues.

Sorry your parents don\u2019t give you back up.", "NTA and your parents need to start acting like parents.\n\nLetting your brother scream and break things at 1:00am and asking everyone to tiptoe around him is asinine. That's how shitty, entitled adults are made.", "Record him screaming and play it at full volume outside your parents room. Or start sleeping in class and tell your teacher you can't sleep well at home because your parents won't sort out your brother. Either way will get them off their asses.", "NTA.

You had every right to say something about him keeping you awake and your parents need to step up and actually be parents. \"Sort it out ourselves\" is NOT a reasonable solution or reaction here. You're not responsible for his outbursts and the real problem isn't some interpersonal conflict between the two of you, it's his unhinged anger issues that yalls parents don't want to address.\n\nAlso, I know your only 16 now but get out of that household as soon as you get the chance.

So calm! She always looked at me like I was nuts. \n\nSecondly, he brother was doing some kind of music project for school, and he needed to download some kind of file or another that for some reason wasn't compatible with his laptop (I think it was a mac vs pc kinda thing, idk what the details were) and he asked to borrow hers to download the file so he could transfer it. \nShe said sure. Even logged it in for him. \nHe accidentally downloaded a virus that had been disguised as the file he wanted. It totally messed up her computer. \n\nWhat I expected to happen:\nBro: Well, you shouldn't have let me borrow it in the first place if you didn't want something to happen! I'm not responsible for fixing YOUR computer! YOU let me use it!\n\nWhat actually happened:\nBro: Oh my God I am so sorry, it was totally my fault, I'll pay for it to get fixed, I'm so so sorry! \n\n\nMe: .....wat\n\n\nI mean, he DIDNT end up paying to fix it, but he was also unemployed at the time and my friend was able to take care of it herself, but he OFFERED. He OWNED UP TO IT. He didn't blame her for letting him borrow it. It was his fault and he *sincerely apologized* and offered a solution (even though it would have taken every cent he had saved up). \n\nMe just standing there having my brain explode in absolute shock and wonder. I was LITERALLY stunned into silence, just staring at them. It was like reality cracked. \n\nAnd it also made me realize that my brothers had ALWAYS been this way. When we were little, my oldest brother *threw a rock at my youngest brother's head* and my youngest brother? He DODGED. Obviously.\nThe rock hit the sliding glass door behind him and SHATTERED.\nDid eldest take the blame for throwing the rock? No. He *BLAMED MY YOUNGEST BROTHER FOR DODGING*. \nBecause if he hadn't dodged, the rock wouldn't have hit the door! Obviously! *headdesk*", "I had a great deal of trouble controlling my temper as a kid, and lemme tell you sometimes it IS impossible. Sometimes it just erupts and boils over and suddenly you're hurling a stack of chairs across a room in a fit of absolute blind rage.\n\nFor me, it was an ADHD thing. Part of the brain (The ACC) that holds you back from impulses like that doesn't function properly with adhd, and if it's untreated/undiagnosed, it can be VERY difficult to understand WHY that rage is happening and as a kid you don't have the words to articulate it.\n\nI do still get that angry sometimes, but years of medication, understanding, and honestly learning to turn those aggressive outbursts onto myself have made me much less volatile OUTWARDLY or PUBLICLY. I'll still rage and scream and throw things (though I've learned what things to throw/destroy that don't matter, like literally garbage such as empty water bottles and the like) but I do it in private and if i ever DO have an outburst in public, I own it. I apologize for my actions and I promise to do better (and I honestly try to). \n\nBut I do also try and educate people around me at those times of what kinds of things can set off that defensive/aggressive response.\nI don't WANT to respond that way. I HATE feeling that anger and rage. It makes my stomach twist and my head hurt and I usually end up sobbing for hours. \nSo if telling someone that \"Hey, you doing XYZ thing that is minor to you, really, REALLY bothers me and contributes to me feeling resentful and annoyed, and I would appreciate if it you could do ABC instead.\" helps me not get irritated to the point of erupting, I'm gonna tell em. \n\nI KNOW its irrational anger. But that's the thing. It's irrational. I don't know why you moving my water bottle one foot to the right makes me want to claw my own eyes out, but it *does*. I may not explode over it TODAY... but eventually it's gonna wear down what control I have and I AM going to burst. I know that. I try to express that.\nMost of the time people are fine with it and stop doing whatever it was that was driving me nuts.\nSome people though..  some people keep doing it. Specifically. Targeted. Over. And over. And over. And over. And eventually... snap.
