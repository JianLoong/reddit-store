You didn't make him break his monitor, he did that all by himself.", "NTA. Your parents are coddling your brother, who is absolutely old enough to better control his anger. Maybe not having a monitor for a while will teach him a lesson. You should also suggest your parents put him in therapy.", "NTA. Everyone else sucks\n\nHe sucks for being unable to control his emotions. The parents suck for not putting him into therapy and enabling the behavior, and ignoring your needs to be able to sleep.", "NTA. Your parents are the true assholes here. Their stance of \"ignore it and it will go away\" is just plain shitty parenting. You weren't being a third parent by going to address your brother's behavior, you were being the ONLY parent in that house. \n\nThe fact that your brother actually believes that it isn't his fault that he is having what are essentially rage tantrums, is proof of just how shitty your parents are. If he truly cannot control his outbursts, they need to get him help. Telling everyone to ignore the fact that this kid needs some sort of mental/medical intervention is just plain child neglect on their part. \n\nIf you have access to some sort of counselling program through school or even a community outreach group, I would suggest you take advantage. You definitely need to be able to talk to a reasonable adult who can help you navigate this until you can get out of that house. \n\nI am sorry that your parents are so shitty and aren't doing their job. But, you are in no way to blame for any of this. You don't owe your brother a montior. But, I would be very careful about keeping your room locked. Since your parents don't believe in actual parenting, I'm sure if he breaks or steals your monitor, they won't do anything about it. They will most likely tell you to \"sort it out\" yourselves again. Seriously, though. Your parents suck. And you can tell them a stranger on the internet said that.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is in full control of his actions and broke it himself. Tell him to have some self-control and dignity, or if he has an actual issue go see a psychologist.

First they get mad at you for \u201cdealing with it yourself\u201d and now they\u2019re putting their hands up and walking away because it\u2019s too messy for them. They need to decide if they\u2019re going to be the parent figures or not because it seems like they\u2019re wishy washy with their duties.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are the big assholes here, raising an even bigger asshole. \n\n\"There's nothing we can do\". Yes there is. Therapy exists. Even if your family is short on funds, schools will help you with these things if your parents bring it up with administrators. They will find low cost-free therapists for your brother to visit and work through his anger issues. \n\n\nYour parents are setting your brother up for failure and anyone who encounters him is in for a tough time. \n\n\nHe's blaming *you* for something *he* did. It's not your fault, OP. You don't control his actions. He does. You had to step in as a third parent because your parents are refusing to help what could potentially be a very fatal problem. \n\n\nThis is a huge ticking time bomb. What happens when your brother grows up and meets someone? What happens when he moves in with someone who won't tolerate the ruckus and the outbursts? Holes in walls? Screaming matches? Physical violence? This needs to be nipped in the bud ASAP, and your parents aren't taking the necessary steps. Instead they've all but given up on it and have convinced your brother he's not responsible for his actions. \n\n\nBut to reiterate, this isn't your fault, OP. None of it is.", "NTA. And don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you are in any way to blame. This is 100% on himself and your parents are enabling it. Is there someone you can confide in like a school counselor or something? Because this seems like a toxic environment for you and your sisters to live in.", "NTA.\n\nNo matter what happened with his monitor, your brother would be TA by making so much noise during sleeping hours.\n\nHe bears full responsibility for his actions, including acting so impulsively that he broke his own property. This is literally 100% on him.", "Uh, your brother needs therapy. Something is wrong here.", "Your parents are TA and not only refusing to find your brother help but settin up an atmosphere where it is the norm for everyone to suffer for your brother.

You did NOT \u201cmake\u201d your brother break his monitor!  That\u2019s entirely on him.  And it\u2019s frankly ridiculous that your parents fault you in any way.  You weren\u2019t \u201cparenting\u201d him, you were simply doing what your parents are now asking you to do\u2014trying to \u201cwork out\u201d something with your brother.  Have to say, your parents aren\u2019t parenting.  They\u2019ve contributed to your brother believing he isn\u2019t responsible for his own feelings and actions.  Try telling that to the judicial system! (Gosh, I only hit him/destroyed someone else\u2019s property because they did X, which triggered me!) your parents are handicapping your brother by accepting his unacceptable behavior, with the entire family walking on eggshells.  At 17, your brother can seek therapy to deal with his personal issues.  In any event, none of this is your problem/fault.", "NTA. Your brother has anger issues. What's worse is that your parents seem to lack the understanding to do something about it. Your bro is probably playing competitive online games and getting pissed he isn't as good as he thinks he is. His uncontrolled anger might not be his fault (just guessing he wasn't taught how to handle his emotions) but he is bringing out the worst in himself by repeatedly playing a game that he can't control his emotions while playing. At 17, he now needs to figure out his anger himself unfortunately. Your parents are so nonchalant about this it's concerning. He broke the monitor because he acts like a toddler when he loses at games. Not your problem. That's on him and hopefully you can convince your parents his reactions to video games are not normal, it's toxic.", "No it's not your fault that he did that. You are all teens this happens.\n\nBut your brother has behavioural issues, and everyone else is stressed to balls with this going on.\n\nSo your parents need to be the firm zone for normal behaviour, and enforce that within reason. Yes he is 17 but that's not an adult yet and if everyone else is suffering then well they have to be the ones to enforce things like screen time management.\n\nHe can play games and rant and rave all he wants, but 1am is too late, no one needs that in their life.\n\nThat means internet restrictions with it cutting out at 00:00, he can play an offline game if he wants but they are way less likely to make him that pissed.\n\nHe ultimately needs to recognise he is in need of help and find a better outlet, physical sports, art, music, even a trip to a rage room.\n\nAnd what causes things like anger issues can be very varied and even a very deep rooted fear.\n\nHell I had anger issues then I found out it was a very deep personal image issue, I hated myself so much it just permaited everything.\n\nAs for the monitor issue, you should always knock, admittedly at that point it would be a kick from me but hey. That may be one part of why he is angry at you coming in. But no if he has aim that bad then a new monitor won't help! :D\n\nSeriously tho just giving him it means you don't have one to study, entertain yourself privately in your room in a way that doesn't interfere with others. And a brake of a few days may just be what he needs. (Also look at pin locking screens in the house, its a fairly common feature.)", "Study, work, save, move out.", "NTA! You did nothing wrong. He should get help from a specialist, your parents should try to help him as well bc this is not normal. And you shouldn't give him your monitor, he broke his and his fault if he lost the game.", "NTA, I would have said you're NTA even if it were you that smashed your disrespectful brothers monitor.", "This is an obvious NTA situation.  \n\nJust a couple of thoughts though:  \n\nGamers can be intense, but even for hardcore gamers this is NOT normal behavior.  \n\nYour parents have exactly zero control of the situation.  \n\nAnger issues don't resolve on their own.  \n\nThis is a classic manipulation on his part -- \"***I*** don't have the problem, ***you*** are actually the one that caused this.\"  He may not be a manipulator now, but this is how it starts.  Incidents such as these are going to give him the training *and permission* to be abusive later in life (incorrect reinforcement, he manipulates and everyone else caves, so in his mind it becomes easy to convince himself he's right).\n\nI HATE telling people to disregard their parents.  But in this case, you have two younger siblings to consider.  Even if it is ineffective at changing the behavior, drawing a line in the sand and saying \"this is unacceptable behavior\" sets the proper standard for your sisters.", "NTA your parents are completely enabling his anger issues rather than dealing with it!!

Why is he even playing games if it just enable his anger issues...", "NTA. That you could possibly believe you are the asshole here reflects just as poorly on your parents' parenting skills/method as everything else in this story.

Your younger siblings must be affected by the noise as well as you.", "NTA! This is absolutely insane and goes way deeper than just video games. If playing gets him that upset and angry, he needs some seriously counseling before his anger turns to other things! They are enabling this behavior.", "NTA besides the behavioral issues and option should be soundproofing like YT creators you shouldn\u2019t pay for his issues.

Sorry your parents don\u2019t give you back up.", "NTA and your parents need to start acting like parents.\n\nLetting your brother scream and break things at 1:00am and asking everyone to tiptoe around him is asinine. That's how shitty, entitled adults are made.", "Record him screaming and play it at full volume outside your parents room. Or start sleeping in class and tell your teacher you can't sleep well at home because your parents won't sort out your brother. Either way will get them off their asses.", "NTA.

You had every right to say something about him keeping you awake and your parents need to step up and actually be parents. \"Sort it out ourselves\" is NOT a reasonable solution or reaction here. You're not responsible for his outbursts and the real problem isn't some interpersonal conflict between the two of you, it's his unhinged anger issues that yalls parents don't want to address.\n\nAlso, I know your only 16 now but get out of that household as soon as you get the chance.

Your brother has clearly zero respect for you to be yelling and screaming at 1am for no reason. To actually punch the computer screen is definite considerable anger issues", "NTA", "NTA.  If my 11-year-old son did that he'd be in big trouble.", "NTA - your parents have put an awful lot on your shoulders and it\u2019s truly awful. There\u2019s been some good advice here in the way of confiding in someone outside the house. Do you have grandparents or other family members? I would be angry and terrified if I were in your place.Your needs and feelings count.", "NTA his rage broke his monitor not you.  He needs counseling for not only his game addiction but also his out rage.  I never understand parents who allow this behavior.  Simply take the play stations out of the house.", "NTA You didn't 'make' your brother do anything, his anger is out of control. Your parents can hardly call you our for trying to be a third parent when they have entirely abdicated their own parental responsibility. Do they not care how frightening and potentially harmful it is to your younger sisters? If he cannot control himself when playing a game, what the hell is he going to do in adulthood when things don't go his way? The immediate reaction of 'look what you made me do' is something you'd hear from an abuser - if you were in an intimate relationhip with someone who had acted like this, I'd tell you to the the hell out and don't look back.\n\nIt is entirely unreasonable for you to give him your monitor, if he damages his own property, he need to replace it. As you have asked your parents to actully get off their arses and do something, how much longer were you supposed to wait for them to do their damn jobs.", "\"Dear brother, it was your hand holding the controller. It was your anger that led you to make the choice to throw the controller. You made the choice to throw the controller, and you're the one who threw it at your monitor. It was your choices and actions, and yours alone, that led to the damage. You now need to accept responsibility for your actions. If you want a new monitor, you'll have to save up for one, or ask our parents for a new one. As you're not entitled to mine. \n\nAfter all, if that was the case, then I could claim that your shouting and keeping me awake has led me to get frustrated. In my frustration I then damaged my monitor, phone, and (insert anything else you want here). Because I chose to damage my items because your actions frustrated me, that means I'm entitled to take your items as replacements. I'm sure you wouldn't think that was fair that you would be punished for my choices. And for that reason, I'm not going to be punished for your choices and poor anger management by giving up my monitor. You're the one at fault, so you're the one who should suffer the loss.\"\n\nI'd go along the lines of something like that to get across the point that it's his fault, and he's the only person who should be losing something.", "YTA - you know he has anger issues and your parents gave you a clear set of rules on what to do, and you chose to directly ignore them and pursue your own sense of justice instead?? and what do you know, it didnt work out and now your crying back to them.", "ESH. He broke his own controller and monitor so that\u2019s on him, but you should know by now your brother won\u2019t ever be calm about video gaming. Advise for the future, as a raging gamer myself, just ignore them. I know that doesn\u2019t solve your sleep issue but as far as sparing yourself from some agony, just ignore raging gamers. We won\u2019t change. We take the game too seriously. I\u2019m guessing your brother playing an obscene amount of warzone 2.0?\n\nEdit: OP I should\u2019ve put this in earlier but after the whining and crying of several commenters here, it seems your sleep issues are over. Your idiot brother broke his own shit and it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll be playing again anytime soon. Hopefully you sleep fine. To clarify, you\u2019re not the asshole here. I thought that was clear the first time but hey, it\u2019s Reddit\u2026everyone\u2019s a critic.", "ESH\n\nYou're not responsible for your brother's anger issues, but you know he has them. So given that you know he has them, there is some level of responsibility on you to take reasonable care to avoid setting him off.\n\nI'm not sure that your family's strategy of \"we can't do anything about it so we're just going to live with it\" is a great way of dealing with your brother, but it's the choice they've made, and you chose to ignore this.\n\nNo, I don't think you should give him your monitor. That's unreasonable.", "Yes", "The fact that their response to \"I can't sleep because my brother is raging out on the other side of my wall\" was: \"well, go to sleep earlier before he starts gaming\" is so troubling. \n\nIf his anger management issues are so bad he's smashing monitors, how are they not concerned that he might hurt someone else? How have they not gotten him into therapy? How have they not removed the console from his room?", "Hopping on the top comment to suggest that OP show this string to her parents. At the minimum they need to start parenting. How about by turning the wifi off at 10 pm and getting brother to the doctor asap.\n\nIf that doesn't work, tell a teacher/school counselor (aka mandated reporter) that your brother's violent outbursts are preventing you from sleeping and your parents are telling you it's your problem to handle, but he has gotten extremely physically violent to the point of destroying things and you are afraid of further escalation. That should trigger an investigation that may be the wake up call your parents needed years ago.\n\nGood luck and be safe!", "Why do people have kids if they refuse to parent them? OP's parents are ridiculous.", "Yea the parents are dropping the ball massively here, how are they going to say that nothing can be done about a 17 year old yelling and screaming in the middle of the night?", "Yeah. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a thing called anger management classes (since my husband used to teach them).  May brother and parents together should try that?", "Agree and it can get worse over time. What if one day it\u2019s a person he hits or worse out of anger.", "Her brother needs the wifi shut off at 10", "They actually don't complain, which is another reason why my parents are dismissing it - they both are asleep by 9, which is when he is eating, so by the time he's upstairs and yelling they're both fast asleep. Hence the *solution* my parents presented.", "Pretty sure this is your brother commenting lmao", "What is with the victim blaming? The parents gave no rules other than pretend he isn't having rage tantrums. How does opening a door to ask someone to keep the noise down in any way count as a pursuing a \"sense of justice?\" She didn't even have a chance to say anything before he exploded into violent behavior. \n\nSo, are you saying that victims are to blame because they should just know not to randomly trigger a family member by opening doors in a shared home?", "So nobody in the house can sleep because he can\u2019t control himself at 17? Anger issue are the problem not the excuse.", "No. Absolutely zero blame falls on op.  Gtfo with that E.S.H. Bs. \n\nVerbally raging to vent is not the same as breaking shit.  And refusing to keep it down and keeping family up is not acceptable behavior even for someone who verbally vents.  Growing up massively is needed here.\n\n100% NTA", "\u201cAs a raging gamer myself\u201d\n\nFor real, touch some grass. It\u2019s free.", "So you are basically saying that raging gamers are assholes and that the victims of their assholishness should just ignore it? Got it.", "Do you also scream while playing games at the expense of the people living near you or are you living alone so you scream to feel less lonely?", "Raging gamer? More like inconsiderate c***.", "So you as him deserve to live alone as far as possible as any human begin. Because you can\u2019t expect all of us to not sleep to cater for your hobby.

Acting like a child instead of saying \"Shit, that didn't work\" and then looked at what happened and thought about how they could mitigate the issue or improve their skill. You don't take the game too seriously, your ego is too fragile to handle your lack of skill.", "It's not ops responsibility to coddle her emotionally underdeveloped brother.", ">So given that you know he has them, **there is some level of responsibility on you to take reasonable care to avoid setting him off**.  \n>  \n> \"we can't do anything about it so we're just going to live with it\" is a great way of dealing with your brother, but it's the choice they've made, and **you chose to ignore this**.\n\nWATF? Him losing a game set him off. He claims her opening a door set him off. How is she supposed to avoid things like opening a door? Is she not supposed to say to the almost grown man, \"hey it's late can you keep it down?\" because that would set him off? \n\nYou basically just said that she brought this on herself because she shouldn't have set him off. Maybe back away from the victim blaming here?", "Wake them up. Every day.", "Right?? Nobody else is going to side with the psycho brother and non-parenting parents here.", "It's incredible seeing these commenters saying OP is an AH in any capacity.

I don\u2019t see how anyone can disagree with that. As for OP, I don\u2019t know how to help her in her situation. She\u2019s certainly not the asshole. I answered her question on that count so the 25 downvotes really don\u2019t make sense (which quite frankly I don\u2019t give a shit about).

But I\u2019m rational, I\u2019ll get it out of my system and that\u2019s it. I\u2019d certainly not toss my controller into the television, shit is way too expensive to replace. People yell, and video gamers take their shit serious. Plenty of times I\u2019ve yelled on warzone. But I get it out of my system and relaunch the game. Not defending the brother here, I\u2019m just saying for OPs sake she should stay away from him when gaming.", "Yes it\u2019s extremely inconsiderate but there\u2019s not much that can be done. OPs brother probably has a video game addiction which isn\u2019t a great companion to an anger issue, so he needs to learn to manage the line between gaming and other hobbies.", "Well that\u2019s the thing. I make sure I\u2019m away from people and contain myself. That\u2019s why I said OP bro needs some help obviously. I\u2019ve never destroyed my system. There\u2019s different types of raging. His is the violent type. Mine is the vocal type. But as I said I\u2019m in a basement so I\u2019m not interrupting anyone.\n\nAlso, he smashed his shit. He won\u2019t be playing anytime soon.

But given that this is the situation her parents have created, don't think of him as a rational human. Think of him more as a vicious dog, or a bobcat or something that they inexplicably keep in a bedroom in their home, and interact with him on that basis.\n\nYeah, I think OP made a mistake by going in to her brother's room.
