You didn't make him break his monitor, he did that all by himself.", "NTA. Your parents are coddling your brother, who is absolutely old enough to better control his anger. Maybe not having a monitor for a while will teach him a lesson. You should also suggest your parents put him in therapy.", "NTA. Everyone else sucks\n\nHe sucks for being unable to control his emotions. The parents suck for not putting him into therapy and enabling the behavior, and ignoring your needs to be able to sleep.", "NTA. Your parents are the true assholes here. Their stance of \"ignore it and it will go away\" is just plain shitty parenting. You weren't being a third parent by going to address your brother's behavior, you were being the ONLY parent in that house. \n\nThe fact that your brother actually believes that it isn't his fault that he is having what are essentially rage tantrums, is proof of just how shitty your parents are. If he truly cannot control his outbursts, they need to get him help. Telling everyone to ignore the fact that this kid needs some sort of mental/medical intervention is just plain child neglect on their part. \n\nIf you have access to some sort of counselling program through school or even a community outreach group, I would suggest you take advantage. You definitely need to be able to talk to a reasonable adult who can help you navigate this until you can get out of that house. \n\nI am sorry that your parents are so shitty and aren't doing their job. But, you are in no way to blame for any of this. You don't owe your brother a montior. But, I would be very careful about keeping your room locked. Since your parents don't believe in actual parenting, I'm sure if he breaks or steals your monitor, they won't do anything about it. They will most likely tell you to \"sort it out\" yourselves again. Seriously, though. Your parents suck. And you can tell them a stranger on the internet said that.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is in full control of his actions and broke it himself. Tell him to have some self-control and dignity, or if he has an actual issue go see a psychologist.

First they get mad at you for \u201cdealing with it yourself\u201d and now they\u2019re putting their hands up and walking away because it\u2019s too messy for them.

Yes there is. Therapy exists. Even if your family is short on funds, schools will help you with these things if your parents bring it up with administrators. They will find low cost-free therapists for your brother to visit and work through his anger issues. \n\n\nYour parents are setting your brother up for failure and anyone who encounters him is in for a tough time. \n\n\nHe's blaming *you* for something *he* did. It's not your fault, OP. You don't control his actions. He does. You had to step in as a third parent because your parents are refusing to help what could potentially be a very fatal problem. \n\n\nThis is a huge ticking time bomb. What happens when your brother grows up and meets someone? What happens when he moves in with someone who won't tolerate the ruckus and the outbursts? Holes in walls? Screaming matches? Physical violence? This needs to be nipped in the bud ASAP, and your parents aren't taking the necessary steps. Instead they've all but given up on it and have convinced your brother he's not responsible for his actions. \n\n\nBut to reiterate, this isn't your fault, OP. None of it is.", "NTA. And don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you are in any way to blame. This is 100% on himself and your parents are enabling it. Is there someone you can confide in like a school counselor or something? Because this seems like a toxic environment for you and your sisters to live in.", "NTA.\n\nNo matter what happened with his monitor, your brother would be TA by making so much noise during sleeping hours.\n\nHe bears full responsibility for his actions, including acting so impulsively that he broke his own property. This is literally 100% on him.", "Uh, your brother needs therapy. Something is wrong here.", "Your parents are TA and not only refusing to find your brother help but settin up an atmosphere where it is the norm for everyone to suffer for your brother.

You did NOT \u201cmake\u201d your brother break his monitor!  That\u2019s entirely on him.  And it\u2019s frankly ridiculous that your parents fault you in any way.  You weren\u2019t \u201cparenting\u201d him, you were simply doing what your parents are now asking you to do\u2014trying to \u201cwork out\u201d something with your brother.  Have to say, your parents aren\u2019t parenting.  They\u2019ve contributed to your brother believing he isn\u2019t responsible for his own feelings and actions.  Try telling that to the judicial system! (Gosh, I only hit him/destroyed someone else\u2019s property because they did X, which triggered me!) your parents are handicapping your brother by accepting his unacceptable behavior, with the entire family walking on eggshells.  At 17, your brother can seek therapy to deal with his personal issues.  In any event, none of this is your problem/fault.", "NTA. Your brother has anger issues. What's worse is that your parents seem to lack the understanding to do something about it. Your bro is probably playing competitive online games and getting pissed he isn't as good as he thinks he is. His uncontrolled anger might not be his fault (just guessing he wasn't taught how to handle his emotions) but he is bringing out the worst in himself by repeatedly playing a game that he can't control his emotions while playing. At 17, he now needs to figure out his anger himself unfortunately. Your parents are so nonchalant about this it's concerning. He broke the monitor because he acts like a toddler when he loses at games. Not your problem. That's on him and hopefully you can convince your parents his reactions to video games are not normal, it's toxic.", "No it's not your fault that he did that. You are all teens this happens.\n\nBut your brother has behavioural issues, and everyone else is stressed to balls with this going on.\n\nSo your parents need to be the firm zone for normal behaviour, and enforce that within reason. Yes he is 17 but that's not an adult yet and if everyone else is suffering then well they have to be the ones to enforce things like screen time management.\n\nHe can play games and rant and rave all he wants, but 1am is too late, no one needs that in their life.\n\nThat means internet restrictions with it cutting out at 00:00, he can play an offline game if he wants but they are way less likely to make him that pissed.\n\nHe ultimately needs to recognise he is in need of help and find a better outlet, physical sports, art, music, even a trip to a rage room.\n\nAnd what causes things like anger issues can be very varied and even a very deep rooted fear.\n\nHell I had anger issues then I found out it was a very deep personal image issue, I hated myself so much it just permaited everything.\n\nAs for the monitor issue, you should always knock, admittedly at that point it would be a kick from me but hey. That may be one part of why he is angry at you coming in. But no if he has aim that bad then a new monitor won't help! :D\n\nSeriously tho just giving him it means you don't have one to study, entertain yourself privately in your room in a way that doesn't interfere with others. And a brake of a few days may just be what he needs. (Also look at pin locking screens in the house, its a fairly common feature.)", "Study, work, save, move out.", "NTA! You did nothing wrong. He should get help from a specialist, your parents should try to help him as well bc this is not normal. And you shouldn't give him your monitor, he broke his and his fault if he lost the game.", "NTA, I would have said you're NTA even if it were you that smashed your disrespectful brothers monitor.", "This is an obvious NTA situation.  \n\nJust a couple of thoughts though:  \n\nGamers can be intense, but even for hardcore gamers this is NOT normal behavior.  \n\nYour parents have exactly zero control of the situation.  \n\nAnger issues don't resolve on their own.  \n\nThis is a classic manipulation on his part -- \"***I*** don't have the problem, ***you*** are actually the one that caused this.\"  He may not be a manipulator now, but this is how it starts.  Incidents such as these are going to give him the training *and permission* to be abusive later in life (incorrect reinforcement, he manipulates and everyone else caves, so in his mind it becomes easy to convince himself he's right).\n\nI HATE telling people to disregard their parents.  But in this case, you have two younger siblings to consider.  Even if it is ineffective at changing the behavior, drawing a line in the sand and saying \"this is unacceptable behavior\" sets the proper standard for your sisters.", "NTA your parents are completely enabling his anger issues rather than dealing with it!!

Why is he even playing games if it just enable his anger issues...", "NTA. That you could possibly believe you are the asshole here reflects just as poorly on your parents' parenting skills/method as everything else in this story.

Your younger siblings must be affected by the noise as well as you.", "NTA! This is absolutely insane and goes way deeper than just video games. If playing gets him that upset and angry, he needs some seriously counseling before his anger turns to other things! They are enabling this behavior.", "NTA besides the behavioral issues and option should be soundproofing like YT creators you shouldn\u2019t pay for his issues.

Sorry your parents don\u2019t give you back up.", "NTA and your parents need to start acting like parents.\n\nLetting your brother scream and break things at 1:00am and asking everyone to tiptoe around him is asinine. That's how shitty, entitled adults are made.", "Record him screaming and play it at full volume outside your parents room. Or start sleeping in class and tell your teacher you can't sleep well at home because your parents won't sort out your brother. Either way will get them off their asses.", "NTA.

You had every right to say something about him keeping you awake and your parents need to step up and actually be parents. \"Sort it out ourselves\" is NOT a reasonable solution or reaction here. You're not responsible for his outbursts and the real problem isn't some interpersonal conflict between the two of you, it's his unhinged anger issues that yalls parents don't want to address.\n\nAlso, I know your only 16 now but get out of that household as soon as you get the chance.

I was LITERALLY stunned into silence, just staring at them. It was like reality cracked. \n\nAnd it also made me realize that my brothers had ALWAYS been this way.

Part of the brain (The ACC) that holds you back from impulses like that doesn't function properly with adhd, and if it's untreated/undiagnosed, it can be VERY difficult to understand WHY that rage is happening and as a kid you don't have the words to articulate it.\n\nI do still get that angry sometimes, but years of medication, understanding, and honestly learning to turn those aggressive outbursts onto myself have made me much less volatile OUTWARDLY or PUBLICLY. I'll still rage and scream and throw things (though I've learned what things to throw/destroy that don't matter, like literally garbage such as empty water bottles and the like) but I do it in private and if i ever DO have an outburst in public, I own it. I apologize for my actions and I promise to do better (and I honestly try to). \n\nBut I do also try and educate people around me at those times of what kinds of things can set off that defensive/aggressive response.\nI don't WANT to respond that way.

If he can\u2019t handle video games and is going to be that level of dramatic over it he shouldn\u2019t be playing them. \n\nI\u2019d go unplug the router and plug it back in and act like you didn\u2019t do it whenever he does that shit just to mess with him. I\u2019d change the password. You can reset your router from your phone if you google it.", "NTA. Your brother is basically grown, he knows what he\u2019s doing is wrong and he knows he\u2019s FULLY responsible for his actions. And your parents\u2026if you can call them \u201cparents\u201d need to step the fuck up and ACTUALLY PARENT! Omg you need to get out of there as soon as you can. Clearly it\u2019s not safe for you there.", "NTA-your parents need to learn how to parent.", "NTA. Your bro might kill someone unless he sorts his shit out quickly. He needs parenting and therapy.", "NTA. I\u2019m going through a similar situation with my younger brother where its my fault he is an absolute dickwad. I would\u2019ve warned your parents you\u2019re just going to yell back at the very least because of how understandably angry you are at the situation though. It may have helped. Thats what I have in plan for when I move back down to my room (got flooded and is being heavily overhauled of stuff I dont need) as nothing I do helps and my parents have either given up or don\u2019t bother helping", "NTA (Unanimous 10-0 decision)\n\nYour older brother definitely has anger issues that need some serious assistance in managing.  Sadly, your parents seem to be failing here (I can't fully assess things, so I don't know what they've tried to mitigate the issue) & his late-night outbursts could cause civil issues with your neighbors (as they could complain to the police) in addition to disrupting your family's sleep schedules.\n\nI'm suspecting your brother is using you as a scapegoat because you tried to confront him.  I thought he was going to break his monitor eventually, which just happened that night.\n\nMy brother's girlfriend's son has some similar issues where he does break things when he gets frustrated, even when it's the nature of the game.  Finding a game to play with him is a chore as he doesn't play well with others in co-op settings (He's burning through all his lives on World 1-1& subsequent stages in New Super Mario Wii... which makes me concerned about playing any games with shared lives) & gets frustrated if he's in last place in competitive games.  When he gets like that, he becomes a threat to himself & items nearby (I've gotten concerned about controllers & TV's), which is when I'm pulling the plug on activities as a safety measure.  His laptop & tablet are in damaged condition (cracked screen, missing keys, ect.).  My own mother heavily suspected that he broke her tablet after she refused to let him on (as he could have grabbed it while she was asleep & there's an extra security layer on it).  She was unhappy about it, but it was a low end cheap tablet, so she was only out like $60 (vs hundreds w/ a high-end tablet).\n\nI just believe you're in a crappy situation & probably can't wait to leave for college... or venture out on your own & away from that environment.", "I remember when I was like 7, I punched a hole in the computer due to raging at Roblox. My dad gave me the ass whooping of a lifetime that day. \n\nPoint is, you don\u2019t need to step up. Your parents gotta deal with your brother themselves and live up to the responsibility of being parents.", "You are in danger.\n\nYour parents are not willing to get up off of their butts and get that boy help.\n\nHe doesn't need a monitor, or a game it is feeding into his anger issues.\n\nYou are his target now.   Kids like this kill, get out, find a relative a friend, or a shelter if need be, better than 6 feet under as that is where you and the rest of your family could easily find yourselves.  \n\nIt isn't that uncommon and your parents will be at fault, but if you are 6' under and he is on death row that won't matter.", "Wow,, def NTA, no wonder he has anger issues, utterly no consequences for his actions. Why does he have wifi, ps4? He\u2019s old enough to work part time buy his own toys, see if he breaks them. All parents need to provide physically is bed, clothes, food and a roof over his head. Do not let him have your monitor, he\u2019s a bully, let him scream and shout, also get a lock on your door. Safe area. Let him scream and shout, it\u2019s just noise. I work with kids who do not like the word no, being unmoved and looking at them quizzically works well. Bullys like volume. Good luck x", "NTA.  Do not give him your monitor. It is not your fault that he can\u2019t cope with losing a game.  It sounds like your parents are afraid of him, don\u2019t want to punish him, because they\u2019re afraid of what he might do to them.  He need serious help.  I am putting a lot of blame on your parents for not putting their foot down, when he was younger.  My boys, 12& 15, play their games.  They get aggravated sometimes when they lose, sometimes they get loud, not ridiculously  loud, but enough for me to tell them to settle or I\u2019ll take it away.  They know if it gets to that point, I\u2019ll take a sledge hammer to it.  If they let a game have that much control over their actions, they don\u2019t need it.  Your brother is plenty old enough to control his actions, if he can\u2019t your parents need to control them.  If they cant, they need to find someone that can.  If he doesn\u2019t, he will lose his temper, hurt someone, or go off on someone and get his hinny kicked, or worse.  He should have been in some kind of treatment well before now.  Does he only lose it like that with video games, or does other things set him off as well?  If it\u2019s just the games, the games would go until he learns self control.", "NTA of course you have to try to be the third parent his actual parents aren't doing any parenting. This s*** is ridiculous. Why aren't they turning off the f****** router at like 10:00 p.m.?", "NTA\n\nYou didn't \"make your brother break his monitor\" - he broke it himself.\n\nAnd if your parents want to control the discipline of your brother, they need to discipline him. Novel concept, I know.", "How can you be the third parent when there is no first or second parent? NTA, but your parents are", "NTA. If they've exhausted every other option, there is one left they can resort to: military school. I do not reccommend it unless it's an extreme case, but if he's not going to fix this behavior now, have someone who won't put up with his bullshit fix it. If it's not a mental issue, that means it's entitlement. Mental issues can be fixed through therapy and proper parenting. Entitlement can only be fixed by learning lessons the hard way.", "NTA. You did not make your brother do anything. He has anger issues and honestly, it sounds like your parents are afraid of him where they don\u2019t even want to step in and parent. Tell someone at school or if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with that, a family member or close friend.", "NTA. It\u2019s not his fault, but somehow YOU control him? absolute batshit nonsense. If there was a kindergarten level of logic to that, you should be able to make him shut up whenever you want, too. Your parents refuse to parent and for that they suck, too.", "i hope u show this entire thread to ur parents, and if they won't do anything, talk to someone at school. for all we know it could be interfering with ur performance considering u can't sleep. this is irrelevant but ur parents r probably going to hell", "OP should tell this to a therapist because that's who she'll be needing to talk to after being treated this ridiculously by her parents and mentally unstable brother.", "NTA, but you need to tell a trusted adult about this.", "NTA, your parents don't parent. They are slackers. You didn't do anything to cause this. Keep your monitor.", "NTA but ur parents and brother are. Actually I don't think ur parents are parents because they do nothing about it. If ur brother can't play his video game without having tantrum like a toddler then take his video games away and get him some kind of help like therapy or anger management. Your brother can take responsibility for replacing his own dam monitor since he the one that broke idc to here his excuses about how he can't help it bullshit u can not play the game if it turns u crazy. Tell him it time to get a job if he has all that free time. But don't give him ur monitor he will just break that one too. Also op u didn't make him break his monitor he chose to do that himself he not taking responsibility for his own actions. Don't let him or ur parents think otherwise.", "Wow NTA and your parents need to start -parenting- the raging (almost) adult they have living at their home. \nHis antics would get him kicked out of any college dorm and/or any roommate situation.\nYour parents will end up with a full grown adult with emotional control problems in the future.", "Oh hell no.  NTA.  Don't budge on this.  He CAN control it.  They CAN parent.  Neither are doing diddly squat.  This is NOT on you.", "NTA. Your parents need to fix the problem and he DOES have control over it (as a gamer, I know he does), and if he doesn\u2019t he\u2019s just refusing to and he needs therapy.", "NTA- your brother and parents both need help learning how to become adults. \n\nThis is not your problem. Absolutely do NOT pay for another monitor or give him yours. \n\nI guarantee this will effect your grades and your parents won\u2019t get you another monitor.\n\nFor your own safety, I would advise not interacting with your brother when he\u2019s having a violent outburst as it could easily turn to you.", "Nta. your parents sound negligent and irresponsible. If your brother truly can't control this behind, he needs meds and therapy. That's not normal.", "OP your brother has some kind of neuropsychological disorder (DMDD? CD?) and needs to see clinical psychologist or psychiatrist for treatment now. \n\nUnless he\u2019s been behavioral therapy for multiple years and been prescribed a mood regulating med, you\u2019ve not tried anything yet.", "Your parents suck. They are not dealing with your brother's behaviour because they can't be bothered and are happy for everyone else in the household to put up with his shit.\nAs a parent of a child who would often get frustrated and yell at the game when it wasn't going their way I put steps in place to teach them that when they got to that point it was time to turn it off and do something else. 9/10 they were able to defeat or accomplish whatever it was after a break. \nIt is not your fault he broke his screen! It is his fault the screen is broken and he will get nowhere in life by not accepting his responsibility. He couldn't defeat whatever it was before you went in, it's unlikely in that state it would have mattered if you hadn't entered.\nYour parents also suck again for not pulling him up on his shitty behaviour and not being willing to get him to suck it up about the role he played in breaking the screen. By saying you and he have to work it out yourselves they are abdicating their parental responsibility. \nNTA.", "NTA. He broke it on his own. And your parents are not good parents", "Therapy expensive, buy him a gym membership and some protein powder and tell him to go ham", "Your brother is far too young to react this way to games.

I hope by reporting it to a mandated reporter your parents will start being parents! \n\nYou didn\u2019t make your brother break anything! Don\u2019t give him your monitor!
