I can't imagine asking my neighbors to text or call every time they let their dog out-that is nuts! She can close curtains on the windows and go out WITH him when he needs to go outside so she can redirect him when he barks. Managing her little jerk is not your responsibility.\n\nETA: I would send her a nice text tomorrow AM along the lines of \"Hey, we will be letting our dogs out multiple times today, and every day from now on of course. Letting you know every time is not working for me anymore, so here's your notice-they'll be in and out every day and I won't be notifying you anymore after this text.\"", "NTA.

People can ask for ridiculous things, and you can refuse.", "After seeing your comments, no, you're NTA. \n\nThis lady wants you to ask permission to let your dogs out, while letting hers out for a minimum of an hour at a time. That's insane. \n\nIf it was a simple text of \"I'm letting the dogs out in 2-5 minutes\" and she wanted a heads up, that's fine. But she wants you to text to ask and then wait if she won't bring her dog in? Hell no. \n\nI also have the reactive dog, and I have had neighbors who communicate with me so we can shuffle dogs. But I never expected them to keep their dogs inside all the time. I just worked on training mine to come inside instead of barking.", "NTA and privacy fence stuff is pretty cheap.  I say this as a dog owner (7 month old English Bulldog) whose dog loves to bark because the neighbors' dogs (small unincorporated area and everyone has dogs) bark... otherwise she is pretty quiet for a big dog.   \n\n\nIf they won't buy it you should.

One will go fucking CRAZY when it sees other dogs and will also bark at cars and people (not in a crazy way, just in a persistent way... she saves crazy for other dogs).\n\nIf my dogs are outside and they start barking, I bring them in.  If they're on walks and start barking, I get their attention with treats and wait until they are calm before rewarding them.  My one dog is pretty good on walks.  My other dog..... sigh.... is getting better, but MAN is she a work in progress.\n\nMy point being that it is MY responsibility as the owner of the \"crazy dog\" to manage her and to try to train this behavior out of her.  The only thing I expect of anyone else is to keep their dogs leashed.  But I don't expect them to go out of their way to accommodate me.\n\nNTA", "NTA. The solution here is that the neighbor needs to train his dog. You shouldn\u2019t have to compensate for their laziness.", "NTA, but I would be concerned if the dog is nuts could it get over the fence & maul your dog. Are you sure she's really worried abt barking and not an attack?", "NTA - Neighbour either needs to bring her reactive dog in when it barks, or take it for training, because you're not responsible for her dog's behaviour.\n\nEdit to add - when my dog barks, I bring her inside. It's not that difficult to do", "If you let your dogs out off leash, in a yard without a fence, YTA.  All states have leash laws.

If you want, you can look at getting a privacy blind for your side of the fence since your dogs don't seem to be an issue.

Would it be at all possible to make a feeble attempt to come up with an alternating schedule of outside time?  Barring that, then let your dogs carry on and let the neighbor stew.", "[deleted]", "YWBTA. \n\nDo you have the legal right to let your dogs on your property without alerting your neighbor? Yeah. \n\nBut I think you'd be an asshole. They aren't saying you have to ask for permission as far as I'm aware - just to give them a heads up so they can handle their dog's needs. It's called being considerate. And if your partner is wfh, why can't they just send a text when they let y'alls dogs out? \n\nIt's also not a simple fix on their part. You can Try to train dogs not to bark, but it's not a guarantee; it depends on the dog's breed, personality, history, and it can be a huge undertaking. The fence isn't a bad idea, and worth bringing up. But even if their dog couldn't See your dogs, they would presumably still smell and hear your dogs next door.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also based on the comments the expectation seems to be you let me know before you let your dog out, and I will let mine out whenever and for prolonged periods and let you know when I am done .... So what considerate thing are they doing!?\n\nMy dog barks and goes crazy despite extensive training, when triggers arise it is my responsibility to manage it.

If they are okay with updating the neighbor while they wfh that's on them, if you're also being expected to do the same when you're home then I would communicate with your partner that you aren't into letting some random neighbor know the minutia of your day, and that if they want to fine but that letting the dogs out will be solely their responsibility then.
