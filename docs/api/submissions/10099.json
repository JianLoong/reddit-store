We know that ultimately a marriage is between those in it, but the way most of us see it you can't cheat and then pretend like everything is fine after. My sister (27f) had a two year affair while married to her husband, which caused their divorce last year. My BIL is a great guy and he's father to my nephew, so he's still a big part of the family, and my parents still call him their son in-law. \n\nThe Family did not forgive and forget. Our other sister (33f) made a point to tell her that she wasn't invited to her wedding in September, and even told security to throw her out if she did show. Our parents host thanksgiving and christmas, and more gentley requested that she not show up. The only family thing she was invited to was our grandmothers funeral, and even just the service, not this little celebration of life thing we did after.\n\nEaster is coming up soonish, and since my wife and I just got a new house with a big yard, we were planning to have a big egg hunt for my niblings (Other sister has three kids). My sister showed up (I blocked her number) and asked if she could come for Easter for her sons sake. I told her no, I'm still not comfortable having her around, nor is most of the family. I told her she could swing by to see her son briefly, but that I didn't her lingering for very long.\n\nShe left crying, and let me know via our parents that she would do that. My wife feels bad, and told me she thinks this has gone on long enough. I tried explaining to her that the whole family would be upset if she came, and that we aren't comfortable around her. Still my wife feels bad and even went to visit her (they were pretty close before all this happened). Now I'm not upset about that, I don't think I have a right to tell my wife who she can and can't hang out with, but still she's given me doubts.\n\nEdit for info: No most of my family is not christian, we just do the egg stuff for Easter. My BIL and sister have 50/50 custody and easter is his time. I don't put this on my nephew, he is always welcome here.", "created_utc": 1676556123, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113rbew/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_isnt_welcome_at_my/", "score": 745, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was between her and her husband. You and your family should keep your noses out of it. High five to your wife for speaking up and going to visit her.", "YTA - no need for you to get involved in the conflict and you should support your sister.

People always seem to be falling themselves to forgive cheaters, but maybe if they had more consequences for their actions, they wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nI mainly say this because her being there with the spouse she betrayed will likely cause pain for him, so for now, I think it\u2019s a good idea to keep them separate as to not ruin the day.

Don't get all the YTA judgments.", "YTA for continuing to pretty much banish her. Yeah she did wrong by cheating on her husband but at the end of the day she's your sister and the mother of your nephew. You nephew will notice the way you are treating his mother eventually.

But none of us are *only* our mistakes. No matter how guilty she feels, eventually she's going to get tired of grovelling for your love, and she's going to be the one to leave *you* behind.

Gtfo of her business, maybe your family are all wrong and you can follow your wife to right this.\n\nI always think something really bad must\u2019ve taken place for someone I truly believe in to sink so low.

She ruined HER family, and not see her son 50% of the time do to her cheating, why are you, her family also punishing her? \n\nAnd in your comments you mentions excepting this punishment be over someday, when you can be comfortable with her again, but when is that? Have you told her that someday you might want to welcome her back, maybe you should sentence her, so she knows (sarcasm) \n\nAnd have you thought about if she wants to come back when YOUR and the family is ready?

I hope one day you guys need her and she shuns all of you.", "nta. im shocked at all the y t as given how harsh this sub usually is on cheaters (as they rightfully should be)! it is harsh but if you act morally questionable for years and hurt other people in the process i don\u2019t really think you get to be upset about how people may react to that.", "YTA and your family is too.

I agree, cheating is bad which is why I say everyone sucks here. But it sometimes isn't that black and white. There can be a lot of gray area in between. You may think your BIL is a great guy.

However the motivation to not cheat should be love not shame. I\u2019m not sure what your family\u2019s end goal here is, as you say you would hope to be outcast if you ever cheated, but I don\u2019t think this is having the effect you think it is. Your sister has a son and my guess is that he is young. You are now involving that child in an adult issue that perhaps the parents wanted to avoid? Have you thought of that? I know people who have divorced from infedelity but waited to explain to their children until they were old enough to understand that the infedlity wasn\u2019t their fault. This child sees your family I guess when the ex comes around but cant see you with his mom? So he is making connections here that Mom is bad and doesn\u2019t deserve her family\u2019s love so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if this kid decides Akon doesn\u2019t deserve his love. Or worse, he makes connections where he believes a bad choice on his part (as a kid) could cut him off from the love of his family. That can cause serious anxiety and behavioral problems. \n\nIf your sister and her ex did not have kids I would still think this is absurd but at least less harmful. The fact that there is a child in the middle of this shame game you all are playing makes this absolutely gross.

She did a bad thing and it definitely isn't something that should just be forgiven and forgotten. The key word there, though is \"just\". If someone is an important part of your life like family they deserve the opportunity to try and make things better. Sure the fact that she did that will always remain, but so will all of the good things and good memories she has given you.

Anyway, I'm hoping you can forgive her eventually and I hope that your sister learns a lesson in this too.

We know that ultimately a marriage is between those in it, but the way most of us see it you can't cheat and then pretend like everything is fine after. My sister (27f) had a two year affair while married to her husband, which caused their divorce last year. My BIL is a great guy and he's father to my nephew, so he's still a big part of the family, and my parents still call him their son in-law. \n\nThe Family did not forgive and forget. Our other sister (33f) made a point to tell her that she wasn't invited to her wedding in September, and even told security to throw her out if she did show. Our parents host thanksgiving and christmas, and more gentley requested that she not show up. The only family thing she was invited to was our grandmothers funeral, and even just the service, not this little celebration of life thing we did after.\n\nEaster is coming up soonish, and since my wife and I just got a new house with a big yard, we were planning to have a big egg hunt for my niblings (Other sister has three kids). My sister showed up (I blocked her number) and asked if she could come for Easter for her sons sake. I told her no, I'm still not comfortable having her around, nor is most of the family. I told her she could swing by to see her son briefly, but that I didn't her lingering for very long.\n\nShe left crying, and let me know via our parents that she would do that. My wife feels bad, and told me she thinks this has gone on long enough. I tried explaining to her that the whole family would be upset if she came, and that we aren't comfortable around her. Still my wife feels bad and even went to visit her (they were pretty close before all this happened). Now I'm not upset about that, I don't think I have a right to tell my wife who she can and can't hang out with, but still she's given me doubts.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
