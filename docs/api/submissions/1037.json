You need to take a breath, re read what you've written and start to slowly dissect it \n\nShe is 11 years old, with ADHD, that alone is enough to cause chaos, trust me.  She can't help what you class as carelessness she is young and has ADHD.  The nail polish, her hanging things, the holes in the wall as she decorates are all her trying to make the room HERS and it shows how much she loves this room and gift you have given her, this space, do NOT take that away from her.  none of what she has done has been from malice, or want for destruction.  She is just trying to create her space with the boundaries she may have.  \n\nShe has gone through a huge change, and you wanted her to get excited and she did and now you want to punish her for the enthusiasm and embracing this new adventure and take that specialness away for what..... for being herself!\n\nAs the mother of a kid on the spectrum with Dyspraxia and Dyslexia and ADHD I have gone through the same frustrations, but its just about changing your perspective.  Is it annoying seeing paint in the carpet, marks on the floor, yes of course it is.  But that lopsided pokemon poster he hung himself, those bookshelves that are broken because he stuffed too many books in because he wont part with one, the ragged marked teddy he will not part with even though he is now 16! The overstacked window with rocks (not crystals actual rocks) he collects everywhere chipping the paint, the fifth broken toilet seat because he does everything with just a little too much heart and heat.  That is what makes my sons room special.  Like him  its a pallette of his personaility.  \n\nThis is her space, not yours, what matters more, her being free to be who she is in the one place she should be safe her home, or your house looking like a show home for visitors\n\nre-evelaute your priorities, and don't be your child's first bully!", "YTA\n\n\nThe room is already destroyed.

You acknowledge the move has been hard but you\u2019re more concerned about inanimate objects than her mental health. Moving her is a bad idea. Counseling would be a better idea.

Well, now she has a broken toilet seat. And hopefully, she will realize eventually that this is no way to live.", "NTA...just wondering why she doesn't stay in the room she has already in and you don't take the markers, nail polish, etc. Maybe instead of leaving her to her own whim you could help her decorate.  Try a reward system to help her with keeping the room cleaner, but know that her idea of clean and yours may be different...she is only 11.  Seriously consider a therapist for her.  It sounds like she is really struggling.", "YTA - what are you doing to address why she\u2019s doing this. Punishing her isn\u2019t the solution, she needs help.", "Yta how would moving her actually help?  This habits will not magically go away bc she is in a smaller space.

It might mean she uses her own money to replace things she breaks.", "YTA\n\nSo you've moved to a completely different place and given her ADHD and other mental health issues, how did you really expect this to go? You've uprooted her and dropped her into a completely new situation with what seems like very little support or help to transition. Wanting her to be excited and giving her the second biggest room isn't giving her support.\n\nWhile destroying things isn't reasonable or excusable, your not addressing WHY she is doing this. Taking away her room won't change her behaviour, it'll just change the location that it takes place. You as the parent need to find out why she is reacting to the move, room, house or whatever this way, as you don't mention it being a issue beforehand.", "YWBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you know your daughter has mental helth problems, and instead of helping her you punish her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't care about your kid, you just care about some deco?

Instead it would feel like even more punishment on top of an already difficult situation for her.  Sounds more like it's causing you distress seeing the damage and although that is understandable, so far it's just paint and used furniture.  And she is using it as a safe space to vent some of her frustration.  You can help her learn some new routines to help her adjust to the changes.  Change is HARD for some people with ADHD.  Much harder than you may realize.", "YTA. You\u2019re punishing her for having bad mental health and just honestly being an 11 year old..?

Your daughter is sitting their showing clear distress signals and you just want to punish and take her room away..", "YTA - having a smaller room isn't going to fix the problem, in fact it might make it worse since she'll have less space for her things. You can still tell her to keep all art supplies/messy things downstairs for your supervision without making her switch rooms.", "She asked for the smaller room in the first place? Because it made her feel safer and you didn't listen? YTA massively.", "YTA. Sounds like you want to punish your daughter for having ADD and having a difficult time adjusting to a new town and new home rather than getting her to a better emotional place. Great job, parent. \n\nYou are overly concerned with \"things\" right now. The walls can be patched and repainted. Focus on getting your daughter the help she needs.", "NTA \n\nI'm dealing with something like this. 3 of my girls are going to be moving in to a large newly remodeled bedroom with attached bath soon. It is also attached to our 2nd living room that's being remodeled. 1 girl won't be allowed to go and will be in a smaller room upstairs with only the communal bathroom. She's messy and breaks/ruins things. She's in therapy and we're doing all we can for her, but that doesn't mean I'm going to give her a bigger area to destroy. Actions have consequences, even when you have special needs/circumstances. If you can't take care of it you don't get to keep it. Her therapist is supportive of all this. \n\nNo one is going to agree with all your parenting choices, even my husband and I disagree sometimes, but you need to be comfortable with your choice. Do you think this is going to have any impact at all? Even if it's just easier for you to deal with? Is she getting the help she needs and how do her therapist/doctors feel about this? \n\nWatching my daughter ruin so much hard work would really upset me, and her sisters are tired of cleaning up her mess, both literally and figuratively.  Yes, this means she's going to miss out on some of the fun stuff, and that hurts me too, but it's a direct consequence of her behavior. She's damage property and her relationships with her siblings, she can't pretend it's not an issue. \n\nNo matter what you decide I wish you all the best.

Parents gotta parent. 11 year olds gotta learn.", "NTA. She has to learn there are consequences for actions. Did you tell her this would be the consequence and she still did it? If so yes. You have to or she will never take you seriously. If not I would say get a family therapist and have individual and joint sessions. Disrupting her environment again might cause more harm then good. Best thing I STOPPED doing with my teenagers was caring what their room looks like. (She is obviously destructive and defiant so that\u2019s something different)", "YTA.  It\u2019s actually better for that space to be hers than asking a sibling to share a bathroom with her.  If she is anything like my ADHD son she isn\u2019t very hygienic or clean either.  You don\u2019t have to provide her with expensive things in her space though.  She sounds like she needs lots of help with strategies and work with executive planning and organisation.  It\u2019s really hard living with ADHD.  Moving her is like punishing her which will affect her self esteem even more.  She needs to respect her space for sure.. but try to help her find ways to make it easier for her to succeed with this.  I think it\u2019s fine to make an agreement with her that if she can\u2019t reach certain minimum expectations then some privileges are removed with the room being the last resort.  Or if there is a good motivator for her.. like something that she WOULD like for her room that could be a reward if she can do some simple things with her room and keep it up for awhile. Good luck .. I can only imagine how hard it is to not feel hurt seeing that space.", "NTA your daughter is headed down a terrible path and she definitely needs to learn that her actions have consequences. You need to make sure she doesn\u2019t act like this when she\u2019s older.\n\nEdit: An 11 year old is perfectly capable of understanding the difference between right and wrong. When children decide to do something wrong, the parents have a responsibility to create consequences for bad choices. No excuses.

With the furniture, go buy wall brackets to attach it into and make it so that she literally CANT move furniture (especially dressers/shelves) on her own. I did that with almost all furniture when my daughter was super young to prevent things from falling over on to her. OR purchase super lightweight kid friendly stuff that can\u2019t be damaged if she moves it. If she\u2019s breaking toilet seats, buy her a cushioned one she can\u2019t break. If she\u2019s slamming doors and bashing up walls and frames, take the f\u2019n door off the hinges and hang up a curtain instead.

She decided she wanted to use acrylic paint to paint a scene on her desk. She wanted LED lights up and didn\u2019t want to wait for our help so they\u2019re everywhere and peeling off paint. There\u2019s nail polish everywhere because she didn\u2019t want to properly prep her workspace and take her time.

Lots of impulsivity and not thinking things through.\n\nWe did take away messy items. But she went into my bathroom to take the nail polish and hair bleach. She wanted highlights and I told her to wait and id take her to a professional. Thankfully not horrible.

The end. \n\nUnless you wanna be like my mom, who had me tested, allowed me to be put on Ritalin, decided she didn't like how it made me act (valid!), but decided that in addition to no longer taking the Ritalin I just definitely didn't had what I'd been medically diagnosed with and that is what she told me for the rest of my life until my therapist diagnosed me as an adult and when I mentioned that to her she said, \"didn't we already do this?

Sometimes the only way to get my brain to move on from something is a combination of distraction and physical exhaustion. Like going on a walk and listening to a podcast. Eventually my brain just runs out of steam to keep obsessing over the other thing and settles into whatever my \u201cdistraction\u201d is. \n\nFor the whole not setting up an area to paint her nails on thing, my suggestion would be to minimize the number of steps needed to do that. Build the prep into the thing as much as possible. If the nail polish is in the bathroom but she has to go to the kitchen to get paper towels to lie down, she\u2019s not gonna. Possible solution? Keep a roll of paper towels right next to the nail polish. Or buy a couple cheap placemats that she can use multiple times and keep them next to the nail polish or by the spot that she usually likes to sit while she does her nails. They probably even sell little mats specifically for nails that might have a little bottle holder built in or something like that. Then she\u2019ll remember to use the mat bc she\u2019ll *want* to use the bottle holder. Novelty can be a big motivator.

We talk it out, always and honestly no holes barred, we explain how it makes us feel, we ask him how it makes him feel and we talk it out.

There's one specific thing she does that she has been told over and over not to do, for many reasons, and it's been addressed in therapy many times as well. She still forgets and does it and it causes damage. Her therapists have agreed that at this point she needs to feel the effect of her choices. Of course there were other steps before this.

But she may be in a phase, particularly after this move, where you need to actively assist her executive function. It\u2019s exhausting, but she can\u2019t do it. Having hammers, or nail polish, or anything else she shouldn\u2019t get into in a place where she can get to them, when she is struggling this much with impulse control, Hass to change. For the current time, you may need to take more drastic measures that are closer to toddler proofing for a highly capable toddler then you would expect for your 11 year old. Once she is in a space that sets her up for success, she can practice those skills.\n\nEdit 2 for something I forgot:\nRuling is NTA if you talk to her and she agrees that this would be a good way to help address the situation. Ruling is YTA if this is a punishment.", "Edit: NAH\n\nIt was a lovely gesture to give your daughter the 2nd largest bedroom, and with her own bathroom too. Having the privacy and the space is great, and it makes sense that you feel upset when you think she\u2019s being careless with it. \n\nI know you wanted her to be excited about the beautiful space, to treat it like a gift, but if you take it away you will hurt her trust by teaching her that the gift had a hefty price tag. It\u2019s very unlikely that she understood the fine print, that she had the foresight to know how many things would get broken or how much trouble it would cause you. She just saw the gift. Her capacity to be mindful of her space is limited by her age, her ADHD, and the big transition to a new town and house. She cannot do what you are asking her to do. \n\nA \u201cclean slate\u201d and do-over might be helpful if you had a messy room, but your kid just isn\u2019t at the developmental stage to see that as anything but a punishment.

A tendency to break or lose items + intense passion for hobbies which can require loads of little tools = some good home design tricks! I recommend the book \u201cOrganizing Solutions for People with ADHD\u201d by Susan C Pinsky. That book also has a section for kids bedrooms. I also saw in a comment that you have lots of support options lined up for her already, and that\u2019s great! Hearing how other people with her condition have problem solved the common struggle of hard on spaces can be a good alternate resource too. \u201cBlack Girl Lost Keys\u201d is another great website for ADHD coping strategies written by someone with ADHD herself! I agree with some of the other commenters that your child is gonna see any locking up of hammers or cutting down on craft supplies as a punishment, so consider reading some of these adult-oriented sources for alternate storage ideas. \n\nEdited after reading more comments:\n\nI recommend editing your post to add what you say in the comments about the resources you\u2019re in the process of getting for her, as well as the contributing circumstance of your husbands cancer diagnosis (glad to hear he\u2019s doing better). \n\nAs someone with ADHD yourself, you have a real opportunity to show your daughter that she can be accepted and loved for exactly how she is. You\u2019ve experienced the shame of having visitors see a messy room, and you understand how women are particularly vilified for not keeping a \u2018tidy home\u2019. Imagine yourself at her age, in her circumstance. What could your parent have said or done to relieve some of the shame  and guilt you felt? \n\nYou\u2019re tanking a lot of hits in the comments, and so I really encourage you to spend some time doing something to uplift yourself before making a choice about how to move forward with your daughters room.

Is she medicated? \n\nYou have rules and if they're not being followed then you have the right to react in what way you see fit.

I told her if she wants it back in the future to let me know. \n\nAfter this thread, I don\u2019t want to move her. But some of the time she does display an uncharacteristic amount of maturity and knows her limitations. She said she feels overwhelmed with the amount of space.

If this is a sticking point with your daughter, try working with her to make sure she understands what steps to take (ex: throwing away trash is one step, then picking up dirty laundry, then putting away all books, etc etc). \n\nConsider things that might be easy distraction points\u2014putting away things that belong in a different room could mean forgetting there was something to do in her bedroom, so setting aside everything that needs to be put away somewhere else and doing it all at once rather than one item at a time could help her avoid distraction. \n\nNeeding help learning how to break things down into smaller tasks can also be huge with homework. This is slightly off topic  but many with ADHD seriously struggle with a larger projects in school because it is not intuitive or easy to figure out the smaller steps needed to succeed at what's expected. \n\nLearning how to develop this skill and being aware it's not easy might save your daughter a lot of heartache with middle & high school classes. Being able to say \"I don't know what steps to take for this, but my guess is abc?\" and get feedback would've helped me develop this skill to the point of not needing that support by the time I graduated.\n\n2) Memory is a serious ADHD issue\u2014if she struggles remembering what she's expected to do, having it written down step by step somewhere visible can help. She might know \"I'm supposed to clean my bathroom and bedroom\", but not be able to remember \"The steps for cleaning my bathroom are x, y, z and 1, 2, 3\". \n\nHaving a consise\u2014not overwhelmingly long to read\u2014list of instructions to reference could make a huge difference. I still have to make lists like this and I'm in my late 20s.\n\n3) Cleaning can be horribly understimulating or overstimulating for people with ADHD. Understimulation could lead to easy distractability\u2014I often ended up stopping cleaning to do something more engaging. Now I play music when I clean (from a non-phone device whenever possible) and get things done way faster.  \n\nOverstimulation can lead to avoidance\u2014are there textures, noises, or smells that are just plain yucky to your daughter? Having gloves for cleaning the bathroom or washing dishes could make textures easier. Having earplugs or noise protection for while vaccuming could help with noise. If cleaning product smells are an issue, switching products or having a mask for while cleaning could help. \n\n4) It may help to modify her environment in ways that make things easier on her. There was always trash on my bedroom floor until I started keeping 3 trashcans in my bedroom\u2014one for every area of my room I might be in when I need to throw something away. \n\nHaving open shelves makes it easier to remember what posessions I have; I don't in my kitchen because I'm renting, and I regularly forget about kitchen implements I own. (One downside to open shelves is added visual background noise, which can be overstimulating in a manner that can be hard to identify).\n\nThese are tips I learned from other people with ADHD; I seriously reccomend looking into ADHD cleaning and home organization hacks. Check youtube for these.\n\n5) The ADHD brain does not have the same reward system as non ADHD brains. We don't get the same positive chemicals releasing in our brains after completing a chore. I believe ADDitude magazine has an article on this? The best thing I've found that's helpful for dealing with the lack of built in rewards is figuring out a way to create rewards for succeeding at mundane things. A blogger I deeply admire talks about a great system here https://www.patreon.com/posts/sticker-method-72811830\n\nThis is getting quite long, so I'll cut myself off, but if any of these tips seem helpful it may be worth looking into how people with ADHD use timers and body doubling, too.", "YWBTA if you inflict her personal habits on the other kids by making an angry tween share their space instead of helping her where she is.", ">At the same time I am so sad whenever I walk into that room.

Most of what OP describes sounds like an 11 year old trying to customize their space. It's an odd age because you're meant to be more independent but it's hard to draw the line where.\n\nSure some of it sounds like carelessness. But we've surely all had a moment where you pull a blind too hard and go eek! Better not do that again.\n\nI'm not saying the daughter cant improve and work on it but it is behaviour I'd expect from an 11yr old, wouldn't take away her room because of it.", "I'm 38 and still figuring out the impulse control. I've been doing a lot better in the last year or so but I was diagnosed in 4th grade so it's been a long time coming.", "She already said she has a psychiatrist which implies medications as that\u2019s what they do.", "My mum is of the same thinking, partly because there are a lot of addicts in the family tree.\n\nAnd she tells me that I don't have ADHD, it's an excuse and I'm just lazy and if I tried to concentrate, life would be easier.\n\nNo biggie, I just have a shrink who specializes in adult ADHD telling me she's full of crap (which she is). Ha.", "repost bot", "OP my son has adhd and is on the spectrum and I get your frustrations.  You aren\u2019t trying to punish her as much as you are trying to give her a more manageable space. I know with my son cleaning a big bedroom can seem overwhelming and he doesn\u2019t know where to start so he just doesn\u2019t do it and it can get trashed very quickly.", "I don\u2019t think she is going down a \u201cterrible path\u201d\n\nBut I also don\u2019t think it is particularly helpful for anyone to act like this is just someone being \u201cmessy\u201d\n\nThis is pretty destructive and rises above \u201cnot paying attention\u201d. I would love to know the time frame for all this damage because it sounds to me, as though it has been less then a year. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t buy that the only consequences to this is that she will lose some damage deposits. This is loose roommates and friends because you can\u2019t respect the things around you enough not to destroy them.\n\nThis is a pretty stunning lack of regard for how her actions are affecting those around her. \n\nI don\u2019t see in OP\u2019s post that the daughter has expressed any remorse, or is in anyway contrite. \n\nAnd it seems like she keeps making the same mistakes repeatedly\u2026. Which doesn\u2019t seem like a mistake, the first time you mess up your walls trying to put something up - ok you are 11 and you are learning. It sounds like she did multiple times with different things each causing different damage to the walls. \n\nAgain, not a bad path, but I wouldn\u2019t be looking at this behaviour and think \u201coh it will be fine she is just messy\u201d", "I just went through the whole red tape and jumped the many hoops for my son for his diagnosis and treatment plan. He\u2019s just turned 11. If you have questions, I can chat and let you know what I know. Might not be much but I knew from early on that my kid had adhd but I\u2019d have to wait until a certain point. All these years I\u2019ve documented and researched so I was prepared.", "For years I thought I was just lazy. I was frustrated, I didn\u2019t understand how everyone said \u201cyou can do it just *do* it! Getting medication is a cop out!\u201d but\u2026. I still struggled. I thought I was a failure. \n\nThen I learned more about ADHD and realized\u2026 even if getting medicated was a \u201ccop out,\u201d if it helped me at work, then that helped my clients, and who was I hurting by trying to help myself do better at work and not feel completely miserable and burned out at the end of the day?"]}
