They knew I was friends with someone with an IEP (one of the guys in the couple from earlier, he has aspergers, but you'd never know) and wanted to know if I'd consider taking Sam to prom. I guess he's always wanted to go, but since nobody asked him, and the girl he asked said no, they wanted to know if I'd take him.\n\nHis mom was also there, and explained that she'd pay me $400, plus all they money for a dress and anything else if I agreed. He'd also have a one-to-one with him so I wouldn't be watching him, I'd just keep him company, dance one or two songs, then he'd be ready to leave.

I work with people with Developmental disabilities and in all honestly, they can be alot of work but also they can be some of the nicest people you can ever meet.

It is sad that the mom is so desperate that she wants to pay people to be a friend for a night.", "NTA, and you and your parents have every right to file a complaint against the principal for sexual harassment. Pressuring a student to be a paid literal escort is, uh, trafficking. They may have the most noble of intentions, but it's not okay that the head of the school is using their official position and office to pressure a student to do something that is so totally outside the bounds of the student's academic obligations. Everyone involved in this proposal needs to be disciplined so that it never happens to another student. They are way out of line here.", "Nta you dont like prom.a d dont want to go you have every right to say no to anyone if you dont want to do somthing", "NTA\nAs a parent I would have been livid if someone asked my daughter about this without telling me.

Similar-ish type of situation, except no one paid him and obviously since they are related there is a familial bond and reason of why he's protective and considerate for her.\n\nFor your situation it would be a kind thing to do and easy way to make some money, but you are absolutely under no obligation and it's not un-kind or wrong to politely say no thank you like you did. You did not insult him or act like it's beneath you, which would be A moves. I am like you and was not interested in prom or those kinds of events and would have hated to be there even for payment, and your focus is more on that element so I don't think you're an A. \n\nI almost leaned towards NTA since it's kind of A-ish for them to try and guilt trip you. I don't think just merely asking was wrong but when you said no they could have simply said \"ok thanks for your time\" and left it at that. I wasn't there though to gauge how hard core they went on trying to convince you, and I'm a little lenient that having a disabled kid is probably hard and the mom seems like she just wants him to get to experience prom like any other kid who enjoys that kind of thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
