Thank you! \n\nI (26F) am getting married this winter. My fianc\u00e9 and I are super excited and we\u2019re beginning to plan out the menu for our reception. For context, I really love chocolate. I\u2019m sort of a chocolate fiend and one of my hobbies is going to chocolate shops and trying to find the best artisanal chocolates. My fianc\u00e9 and I actually met that way. Therefore, I\u2019m planning on having lots of chocolate desserts at the reception and our wedding cake is going to be chocolate as well. \n\nHowever, one of my bridesmaids (Eva) is severely allergic to chocolate. It\u2019s not an airborne allergy, but if she eats it it\u2019s serious enough that she\u2019ll go into anaphylaxis and possibly die. When my fianc\u00e9 and I were discussing the menu with the wedding party, she looked sort of upset. After the planning session, I pulled her aside and asked what was wrong. She told me that she felt like I wasn\u2019t taking into consideration her allergies when planning the wedding menu, and that she\u2019d prefer it if there were only a few or no chocolate desserts at all. \n\nI was sort of surprised since she\u2019s never had an issue with me eating chocolate around her before and I assured her there\u2019d be non-chocolate options as well for people with allergies or for just anyone who doesn\u2019t like chocolate. But she was still upset and said that it wasn\u2019t fair that 85% of the desserts would be chocolate and that she\u2019d feel left out if she couldn\u2019t participate in eating the wedding cake. She also brought up that the chocolate fountain we\u2019re planning to have might splash on the non chocolate desserts, and even though I told her that the chocolate and non chocolate options would be separated, she still looked upset.

Her allergies are accommodated by having non-chocolate options separated from chocolate ones.

This is your wedding, not hers. Plus, unless she's planning on taking a swim in that chocolate fountain, you've got nothing to worry about.

Or if that is not possibility I take my own snacks or food to eat safely. Sometimes it means I have to opt out from some celebrations like my cousin's birthday celebration with theme of apple harvest. I'm allergic to apples to point I can get anaphylaxis just from being in room with raw cut open apple (bake them or cook them and I can safely eat them). I just told no to the invite.", "NTA. You have multiple options that are suitable for her allergy and you've put thought into her safety with separating the allergen-free desserts.

You could easily turn it around to see who's more reasonable: If she was a true friend, she would be happy to have the non-chocolate desserts at your wedding, and not ask you to change your menu away from your preferences to please her.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and your making choices that make you and your fianc\u00e9 happy and that have significant meaning to you. You\u2019ve provided alternative arrangements, so your not in the wrong. \n\nAlso, I have to admit I don\u2019t remember the last time I actually ate the wedding cake at a wedding more than a bite or two.

Honestly I\u2019ve only had cake at maybe half the weddings I\u2019ve attended and this includes when I was in the wedding party.  And I LOVE cake. There\u2019s always a lot going on and I guess I just missed the cake cutting. Your friend can enjoy the non chocolate desserts or just skip dessert. It\u2019s not a human rights violation if she doesn\u2019t get cake. \n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible for a host to guarantee that catering won\u2019t cross contaminate things, but you can do your best to communicate this need. At that point the guests need to determine whether they are comfortable with the degree of care.  If your friend\u2019s allergy is severe she should be used to weighing the risks and have a plan for if the worst happens. \n\nMy niece has a latex allergy which was diagnosed in the mid 2000s before it was known that it was generally not dangerous for her to have food that might have been touched with latex gloves. Imagine asking at every restaurant if they used latex gloves. Kitchen workers speak multiple languages and communication was super difficult. Plus a lot of kitchens had a variety of gloves so you had no idea who was using what. My sister kept cupcakes in the freezer for my niece to take to birthday parties because she couldn\u2019t risk the cake. She even bought one to a wedding where my niece was flower girl. She learned to ask for the chef at restaurants and talk to them personally.  Thankfully it was later found that my niece didn\u2019t need to be so vigilant but what a challenge that was.", "NTA, OP, If Eva was a true friend, she would enjoy the variety of desserts that are available for her & enjoy seeing you have the wedding you want!", "Nta she can just... not eat it.", "Nta she just doesnt want to be the black sheep witch is understandable but its your wedding", "NTA. It's your wedding. You're going to have non chocolate options.  The only thing I would suggest is if possible, make one of the non chocolate options to be a smaller version of the wedding cake, so everyone can have a piece.\n\nIf she was a true friend she wouldn't expect you to redo your menu  just for her when you've already made accomodations for her.\n\nSince chocolate is a big thing for you and how you and part of the story of how you and your fiance met, chances are lots of people at the wedding will know this, chances are people will talk about it if you don't have chocolate. Does she really ewxpect you to field a bunch of questions/comments about you not having chocolate at your wedding?  Is she fine with you telling everyone you dodn't have chocolate because of her allergy? Would she feel comfortable with a note on the dessert table saying there's no chocolate due to a member of the bridal party having an allergy? Why didn't every guest get asked about allergies and food preferences? I mean I personally wouldn't say shit about a lack of chocolate at a wedding  but plenty of people would if they knew at least one of the couple was really in to chocolate. It's going to create a lot of stress probably if you give in to her demands. Which is what she is doing right now without coming out and saying it. She needs to get over herself and deal with the fact that there will be desserts she can eat, instead of focusing on the desserts she  doesn't want there.", "NTA. I thought you were going to say you were serving chocolate and only chocolate. Or that her allergy was severe enough that being around chocolate could trigger it. Sometimes having allergies or dietary restrictions means you miss out. That sucks but others aren\u2019t expected to bend over backwards for you. One of my bridesmaids is allergic to fish and shellfish. A friend of my husband is allergic to shellfish. We decided not to do shrimp as an appetizer during cocktail hour due to a higher probability of cross contamination. For dinner we wanted a fish option. I called my bridesmaid and asked if there were any precautions we should have our caterer take to make sure she was safe. She said just make sure they knew about her allergy so they would be extra careful plating her meal. She didn\u2019t insist on us leaving out any option she couldn\u2019t eat! You have already done enough by having non-chocolate options and ways to avoid cross contamination.\n\nEdit to add: I also love chocolate and am seriously jealous of all of your guests at your chocolate filled wedding!", "NTA.\n\nI rarely, if ever side with the bride, because... Bridezilla's are very real.  But you could absolutely assume any banquet to have some kind of chocolate. It's not like it's a new allergy for her either. I can't eat bananas, and I'm not going to flip out over a banana split bar.", "NTA. You are providing non chocolate desserts. MAYBE get a tray or two of mini cupcakes of various flavors just in case there are other people there who don\u2019t want chocolate cupcakes can have that. And definitely separate desserts.  That is enough. Is there a tiny risk. Yes but she also has equal risk going to the store or restaurants.\n\nSide note:  Asking for a friend can I come. \ud83d\ude00. I have always wanted to go to a place with a chocolate fountain. If you think of it after the wedding we all would love to see all the chocolate desserts pictures.", "Your wedding, your menu, your choices about what happens and is served at the reception. I've never heard of a wedding guest dictating what is served or not served at a reception and you shouldn't have to accommodate her since she can choose what to eat also.", "NTA. It's adorable how you and your fianc\u00e9 met and I love how you're making it such a theme at your wedding. \n\nYou're offering other alternatives and are aware of cross-contamination issues so you are making sure she (and others) are included. Don't redo the whole reception for one person. It's for YOU.", "NTA. It is not airborne, you are taking steps to minimize contamination (I would have the chocolate fountain on a separate table than the other desserts, if you can ). \n\nI am allergic to pineapple. If I even touch it, I breakout. I have never once in my life asked someone not to have it at their wedding. I just avoid it.\n\nAlso, I have been to a lot of weddings and eaten the cake at about half of them (and I really like cake). I asked my husband how many weddings he's eaten the cake at and his response was \"ours\".", "NTA. I've been a vegetarian for 30 years now and while allergies are a little different--she didn't choose her allergy--all she should ask is that you make some accommodation for her... and she ought to appreciate that extra effort! I certainly do, when I'm the annoying one with special needs. \n\nShe should not ask or want you to deprive yourself, that's not how friends treat one another.", "It\u2019s your wedding and is for you and your partner. Have what you want as it\u2019s your day and others should respect that and your decisions.", "NAH. You did put her in a shitty situation though. Majority of the things there could possible kill her and the risk of cross contamination would absolutely be high as hell. However, it\u2019s your wedding and you can whatever you want. If I was her, I would just attend the ceremony and not the reception", "Congrats on the pending wedding! Having a couple close family/friends with what can be life-threatening food allergies, I think cross-contamination is likely the biggest scare for her. If you eat a peanut and then touch my nephew's arm with your finger, he starts breaking out in severe hives. His insides do the same thing if he eats even the tiniest amount or breathes it in. There are only two vendors on all of Goldbelly who guarantee to be nut-free (and they're super yummy!).  My friends who limit gluten or dairy have also landed in the hospital with cross-contamination and someone assuring them what they were eating was nowhere near the stuff that can harm them. \n\nFor example, the allergen-free line at one of the dining halls on campus is free of the top eight allergens (gluten, nuts. dairy, soy, etc.) and has it's own area: separate staff, utensils, cleaning supplies, dish machine, pantry, cooking appliances, even their uniforms are cleaned separately than those for the rest of the staff. \n\nYou eating chocolate in front of her isn't the same as knowing there was no cross-contamination between prep surfaces, utensils, staff, etc. for the food that is supposed to be non-chocolate. It doesn't have to be something designated as chocolate to put her in danger. If the same caterer is making everything and they don't specifically guarantee no cross-contamination, that's a risk for her. No idea if her allergies are as severe as the folks I know.\n\nMaybe she just wants a better selection of desserts and to share your wedding cake on your special day. But maybe not--maybe she's worried about not being able to safely eat anything. Can you talk with her further to see what the issue is and how a compromise might be reached if you're so inclined?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is NOT a safety issue, there is NO risk for her health - so there is no need to be more inclusive. And: YOur parents are AHs, tell them to butt out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy are you even discussing this?", "I'm having a tough time with this one. It is your wedding, your day, your choices, and obviously chocolate is important in terms of how you met as well. No one should be demanding you change anything to suit them. That said, cross contamination is a huge issue with food allergies, so unless you've made the caterer very aware of the seriousness of her allergy and they have agreed to make the non-chocolate desserts completely separately and keep them in a separate location, I can understand her concern. I guess NAH, if you've taken those precautions.", "If I were her, I straight up would not go to your wedding. You don't seem to be concerned at all about cross contamination, which is extremely likely.\n\nUnless the catering team knows about the severe allergy, she won't be able to eat literally anything at your wedding without a high risk to her health and life.", "ESH\n\nYou - for knowingly making your bridesmaid feel as if she has a target on her back and will not be able to relax and enjoy the moment for fear of going into anaphylaxis.\n\nAnd her - because she has every right to step down as your bridesmaid and not attend an event that has the possible chance of killing her.", "YTA.

You\u2019ve also got a chocolate fountain so risk of airborne droplets of chocolate. \n\nThis is an anaphylactic shock allergy. IMO YTA if you do not, at minimum, ensure that your caterers are aware that there is a guest with analphylactic allergy to chocolate; that the kitchen needs to operate to prevent cross-contamination; that Eva has a separate plate provided that is prepared and separated in the kitchen, so she doesn\u2019t have to go near the buffet and risk contact with her allergen; and potentially that guests are aware that there is someone with an anaphylactic allergy to chocolate, so they know to be careful around the buffet / chocolate products. All it takes is a kid with chocolate fingers grabbing her hand. \n\nIf you care about someone enough to make them a bridesmaid, I would expect you to care enough about them to at least try to safeguard them knowing they are seriously allergic. Being a bridesmaid puts enormous pressure to attend, and you\u2019ve made your menu majority incompatible with her health. If I had an anaphylactic nut allergy, I wouldn\u2019t want to go to a wedding that was almost entirely nut-based, because I wouldn\u2019t want to risk my life.

Further, get her a specialty desert she loves that can be guaranteed allergen free.

How can the guest at the wedding ensure that the buffet food available to them hasn\u2019t been cross-contaminated by guests? \n\nAllergies are absolutely the responsibility of hosts - it is appalling etiquette to not ask about (and therefore act upon) allergies when hosting any event, nevermind a wedding where it is an event that lasts all day and is expected to have food. And even moreso for someone *in the wedding party*.", "If she was a true friend, she would be willing to die for your happiness.", "Thanks for this thoughtful response! I think there is a gross misunderstanding of why this is an issue by people who don\u2019t have first hand experience with life threatening allergies. As someone with a few anaphylactic allergies, it\u2019s pretty disheartening to read some of these comments. I always liken an allergy to rat poison. How would the guests feel if a bunch of the food had been sprinkled with it? Sure, you can try your absolute best to avoid it, but knowing there\u2019s something lethal floating around makes an event pretty unpleasant to attend. \n\nIf her allergy is very severe, the thought of so many guests eating a lot of chocolate, and then leaning in for hugs/kisses, touching things like tables, chairs, door handles etc can be pretty daunting. It\u2019s one thing to manage if one friend or person beside you is eating something. When you have an allergy you\u2019re hyper vigilant about what everyone around you is eating all the time, and if they wash their hands or not, and what they touch afterwards. It\u2019s very hard to keep track of what\u2019s still \u201csafe\u201d (for example which people didn\u2019t eat chocolate, who do you feel comfortable hugging, which foods/surfaces managed to avoid cross contamination etc) after an entire room full of people have been touching and eating the thing that could kill you.\n\nTotally different story if the allergy isn\u2019t this severe and she just wants more food options. Typically I just eat before events or bring my own food. I\u2019m still hyper aware of what/who I\u2019m touching and make sure not to touch my mouth or eat before washing my hands. It\u2019s honestly pretty exhausting and I never expect anyone is going to be able to accommodate me all the time, but I would be pretty disappointed if a close friend or family member hosted a wedding with peanuts being a major theme.", "This is the answer IMO - alert the caterer and work with Eva in advance to ensure that there is a suitable dessert option for her that will be held aside to prevent any cross-contamination or any guests taking her portion. It might mean she has to pre-select one portion of dessert, and doesn\u2019t get the buffet experience other guests have, but IMO this is enough for OP to meet their moral obligations - they shouldn\u2019t have to change the menu for her as long as there is an agreeable option. \n\nDepends how far OP is willing to go with what that option is - it would be shitty if it was like, a fruit plate for Eva and a chocolate smorgasbord for everyone else, but if there\u2019s a couple of dessert options that won\u2019t be chocolate, then just holding aside a portion of each for Eva. \n\nBut I agree that actually, the caterers need to be involved in this from the get go - because so much of the menu will involve chocolate it\u2019s not going to be as simple as putting some macarons made in the one kitchen on a plate or whatever; they\u2019re going to have to make sure the non-chocolate options are prepared separately to the chocolate to prevent cross-contamination.", "Yes this is the way. At least have your caterer put a dessert or two aside for her and maybe even prepare her a dinner plate in advance as well just to be sure. At MOST ditch the chocolate fountain but I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s necessary.", "That\u2019s a good idea, there may be fruits etc for the chocolate fountain so it would be good if she could load her plate before anyone else got near just in case.", "Also you can just not have dessert. Does that suck? Yes, it absolutely does. But the night is for the bride and groom, and it seems like chocolate makes up a big part of it.", "I feel like it should be said, its not really 15% devoted to their dietary needs, its just being nice enough to not include a single ingredient in every single item. It would be like being lactose intolerant and going to a wedding that had cheese in 85% of their food.\n\nThat being said, I get and agree with your point.", "I do not agree with you at all. \n\nIf an allergy is so life threatening it is incumbent on the sufferer to protect themselves by assuming everything is probably cross-contaminated and should therefore bring their own, safe food with them. \n\nIt would be utter stupidity to shift that personal responsibility onto another person.", "A true friend could also simply skip dessert. Avoiding sweets really is possible; ask anyone on a keto diet.", "OP has stated the chocolate and non-choclate desserts are provided by two different sources.", "This is a really good idea, thank you! That way, we can avoid cross contamination. I\u2019ll pass it along to the caterer.", "We did this at our wedding with nuts. My nephew has a peanut allergy and we had a candy buffet that I knew I couldn't keep completely peanut-free, so my nephew got his own goodie bag of candy to enjoy (and we may have gone overboard).", "I think the issue is more splashes and spills. Having mostly chocolate desserts isn't an issue but one that could make chocolate get everywhere seems risky to me.", "True, but then there\u2019s also a member of the wedding party who will potentially have to pack her own lunch because she hasn\u2019t been assured the caterer has been instructed to take precautions.", "Only if the bread has been vaccinated.", "That sounds like an exercise in frustration. People are absolutely horrible at not messing that kind of thing up. \n\nJust have the caterer have a separate plate for the allergic bridesmaid. Much safer and easier too.", "Caterers are really accommodating most of the time. My SIL had Type 1 diabetes, and when her sister was getting married, the caterer fixed a plate ahead of time so she wouldn't have to worry about her blood sugar dipping while waiting in the buffet line.", "Caterers can be really cool about this too, since it\u2019s often not taken as a \u201cbridezilla\u201d move to be firm about it on behalf of others. I was aggressively firm about my friend\u2019s gluten allergy and cross contamination. And the caterers were VERY kind about it and helped assure me and show me that it was marked on every list and card and every opportunity to make sure it would be nearly impossible to give him gluten by accident. \n\nMy friend appreciated it a lot too, since a lot of people are shockingly dismissive or forgetful about allergies and intolerances, and he\u2019d had incidents at weddings in particular before where nobody on staff had been informed or the degree of careful necessary hadn\u2019t happened. \n\nThis last bit is probably why your friend is upset if this is not her typical behavior. Assure her you\u2019re going the extra mile with the caterers to be sure she has something just for her to eat safely. \n\nDoes she have a particular dessert she likes? If so, and you *really* extra want her to feel included and appreciated, maybe have one of the non chocolate options for her be that, so she feels like you really care.

And you make a good point.", "Valid, perhaps the chocolate fountain should go.  Also I think they are kind of gross. What about single chocolate fondue servings - you could serve warm chocolate fondue in martini glasses with cut up fruit on a little wooden spear. It would be so cute!", "Weeeeellllll\u2026 as someone who despises chocolate, it sounds like I personally would not have a good time at your wedding in terms of dessert. To be clear, your wedding menu ultimately comes down to what you and your fianc\u00e9 want but I DO think it might be nice of you to consider offering a wider variety of dessert options for your guests. Not everyone wants to drown in chocolate like Augustus Gloop and unless you have a lot of passionate chocolate eaters in attendance, you may find a lot of the dessert left untouched as it sounds like it may be a bit one note/overload. \n\nAs someone who also has a weird allergy, I can empathize with your bridesmaid. I won\u2019t eat something if it\u2019s in the same general vicinity as my food allergen and I worry quite a bit about cross-contamination if I see it on the menu. Someone else has already said this but you absolutely MUST flag the severity of your friend\u2019s allergy to your caterer. This isn\u2019t just a matter of them keeping the final desserts separate but that awareness will impact the precautions they take in the kitchen. I don\u2019t think your friend approached this the right way but I can understand why, in her mind, she sees chocolate all over the menu and thinks \u201cgreat, risk of death just went up 85%.\u201d I\u2019m going to say NTA because, again, it is your wedding but I think you should have a conversation with your friend to see what kitchen precautions/alternatives would make her comfortable and also have a discussion with the caterer ASAP.", "A chocolate fountain is Klassy with a K! \nYTA so why did you even invite Eva?

Maybe get a few non chocolate cupcakes to to put on the side as compromise.", "NTA. I think it was very rude and inconsiderate of Eva to tell you that you need to change your entire menu. Allergies are a serious thing and as an allergy sufferer myself I get it, but not to the level of asking the entire dessert menu to change because of one dessert. I would definitely talk to your caterer and make sure it\u2019s possible that your chocolate and non chocolate foods are prepared separately and any other precautions. Talk to the bakery or baker making the cake and see if they can do anything as well, they could make a separate flavor/slice/ sampling for Eva.", " NTA but it would nice if you made her feel welcome and included. Ask the wedding cake maker to make a chocolate free mini cake especially for her so she will have the same type of cake.. and as said before, make sure she is first in line for treats.", "Nta for having chocolate at your wedding. \n\n*However,* if this was about nuts, would this change your stance on accommodations?\n\nYou need to sit down and discuss with your bridesmaid the severity of her allergies. Is the slightest trace of chocolate through cross-contamination going to be a serious issue for her?\n\nI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t have chocolate at the wedding, but you should look into stricter allergies measures depending on the extent of your friend.\n\nSure you can have separate tables, but what will that change if *every* dessert was stored in the same place beforehand? Why do you think many candies have \u201cproduced in a facility with tree nuts\u201d on their packaging even if they don\u2019t contain nuts? Because trace amounts through contamination are always possible and it\u2019s better to be safe and avoid such things then sorry in the hospital. \n\n**Your caterer HAS to be informed about this to help prevent any accidental contamination from the source.** \n\nThe issue about the wedding cake is on her though, I must say. You\u2019re not obligated to change your cake flavor simply because she feels she\u2019ll be left out. She can just eat a cupcake or other non-chocolate dessert instead. \n\nYou\u2019re not TA, but I feel you might not be seeing the true depth of the picture? Eva\u2019s requests beyond allergy preventive measures are over the top. If the amount of chocolate you would be serving at your wedding would truly harm her, maybe it would be best for her not to attend, as harsh as that is (but I think that should be a decision for her and not you). \n\nAsking you to reduce the amount of chocolate at your wedding or abstaining from serving it altogether is a HUGE ask. However, neither of us are doctors and I don\u2019t want to minimize Eva\u2019s allergies by assuming the least when it could be extremely deadly. \n\nIt all boils down to how far do Eva\u2019s allergies go, and the steps you can take after that conversation. The scale of how much of an AH your friend is, would depend on the severity of that allergy, because if she could die from simple cross-contamination, I could see why she would request you to reevaluate your menu, but if her allergies are not as intense in regards to contamination and only toward consuming actual chocolate, then her AH-ness would be a lot more, since you\u2019re already planning to provide non-choc snacks at your wedding.", "Sounds like you don't even like your bridesmaid. And you seem to have a controlling issue so YTA", "NTA, you\u2019re parents are dongweasels too.", "I'm allergic to chocolate,  NTA.\nyou had other dessert options. \nPeople are allowed to enjoy it, it's one of the tastiest things in the world, and while not being able to eat it sucks,  people who can shouldn't limit themselves.", "NTA. You should uninvite her as well.", "NAH. I see both sides of this (which I hate, because I like clear answers). You love chocolate to the extent it\u2019s a hobby for you, so you should get chocolate stuff for your wedding day. Eva could have her throat close up from chocolate cross-contamination, so she will be on alert and have a shitty time even if she doesn\u2019t go into anaphylaxis\u2014plus she\u2019ll resent you.\n\nSince chocolate fountains are pretty naff anyway, could you sacrifice that and/or let Eva know she\u2019s welcome to skip the reception?\n\nAs someone who was misdiagnosed with celiac disease for a whole decade (turned out I just have IBS that was getting triggered by gluten since I rarely ate it, woo!), I know the frustration of trying to celebrate with well-meaning loved ones who say they\u2019re keeping you safe when they\u2019re not. This is why it surprises me Eva is planning to eat any dessert at all. \n\nHere\u2019s why: If your non-choccy desserts are being prepared in a kitchen that EVER prepares chocolate desserts, in vessels that have ever held chocolate, she will almost definitely consume trace amounts of chocolate because of cross-contamination. There\u2019s just no way to avoid it. So, either she\u2019s not as allergic as she thinks (if she\u2019s ok with eating anything from a caterer or bakery that ever preps chocolate) or she\u2019s irresponsible about her allergy. Responsible people with a true, serious food allergy don\u2019t, in my experience, eat food they didn\u2019t prepare themselves at home or buy from a reliable, allergen-free bakery/restaurant/source.\n\nSo, you might want to get some further details. How much chocolate will trigger Eva\u2019s anaphylaxis? How often does her reaction happen, and when/how? Will she have epi pens with her and accessible at all times? Would she like to bring her own dessert? Is she aware there\u2019s no way you can safely accommodate her, keeping kitchen/equipment cross-contamination in mind?\n\nLast thing, even when I thought I had celiac disease and would probably get cancer from it eventually, I would never have used the emotionally-manipulative language Eva used on you. Even if you were planning to serve your food on flour-dusted plates made of bread. I\u2019d have just let you know I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend the reception or do everything required of a bridesmaid, so I would like to be a ceremony-only guest or not attend the wedding at all, please forgive me, yadda yadda. And I\u2019d make it clear no amount of change to your menu would really change this because of cross-contamination via shared equipment. \n\nSo Eva sucks a little for her approach and sloppiness about a life-threatening allergy, but perhaps not for feeling left out. She will need to be left out for her own safety.", "NTA- She\u2019s an adult and knows the risk. It\u2019s her responsibility to make sure she doesn\u2019t ingest it.", "NTA.  It's super kind that you ARE thinking of her and accommodating her by having additional dessert options and planning to ensure there is no cross-contamination.  This is you and your fianc\u00e9's wedding, not Eva's.  You don't have to be worrying about what type of cake she wants; you're going to have a lot more on your plate with planning.  If Eva chooses to remain upset about this- please know that it is about Eva and not you.  I hope she comes around and that everyone supports you in your wedding planning!", "NTA \n\nOP,  I say this as someone who despises chocolate cake, ice cream, and most chocolatey things to the point my uncle once joked to my mother that they switched me with another kid in the hospital when I was born, you would only be the AH if you switched the cake and menu. \n\nBecause you *are* being inclusive. If it was an airborne allergy, changing it would make more sense but it's not. All Eva has to do is put on her big girl pants and not eat the chocolate options. \n\nFinally, the whole 'if you were *really* my friend, you'd do this' nonsense needed to be left in HS or freshman year of college at the latest. You're all (presumably) in your late 20s. It's not Eva's wedding. Go and eat as much chocolate as your bridal heart desires OP!", "Can I have her invite to your wedding? Because I love chocolate too with no allergies to such a delicious gift form the Gods\n\nIn seriousness, I think it\u2019s fair that she\u2019s concerned about her health and cross-contamination. And it sounds like you\u2019ve already supplied the best solution possible for her. I think ultimately people with severe nut allergies, live with us every day. A lot of people still eat nuts and they have that residue on their hands. And now she can\u2019t control the world around her and in an ideal world it would be nice if private occasions like your wedding could be catered to her, it\u2019s just not realistic when she\u2019s not the one hosting.\n\nAnd I think anyone who uses\u201d if you were a real XYZ\u201d are throwing low blows and unfair ultimatums. It\u2019s basically emotional manipulation and that\u2019s really not appropriate in an adult conversation. She didn\u2019t get her way and now she\u2019s resorting to blackmail tactics.\n\nThe petty part of me and hot headed part wants to say: \u201csay I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.

Eliminate her fears. In this case, the fear was chocolate getting into the non-chocolate items.

Just validating this person\u2019s suggestion.\n\nIts a 5 minute phone call that can be taken care of before it becomes a problem. Communicate in unambiguous terms that this request is due to a severe food allergy - the anaphylaxis-level kind of allergy. You\u2019ll be doing them a favor, too, since now they won\u2019t have to deal with BM in their kitchen on the day of your wedding asking them to make a desert plate with serving utensils that need to be re-washed and sanitized just for her.\n\nOh also NTA.", "Or she could just uninvite Eva.", "Maybe I'm an ass, but it's desert, and people who have allergies are responsible for looking after themselves.\n\nThat said, if it were the main course, yes, do the jumping through hoops, every one should have dinner! But this is desert. It's not a necessity, and it's not Eva's wedding. Plenty of people pass on the cake or dessert table. While unfortunate, Eva may have to deal with not having a desert if she's worried about cross contamination of the non chocolate items. \n\n\n\nPeople baffle me. Sure it's a special event, but it's not Eva's special event. Otherwise, would she even be having dessert on the night in question? Probably not. I wouldn't have even brought this up the bride, let alone had the audacity to ask the bride to nip something that's actually part of her love story of how the couple met and seems a big thing in their life. \n\nOP NTA.", "You are asking your friend to trust, and put her  life in the hands of ALL your guests to keep her safe. \n\nJust ONE 'oops, sorry, forgot', ONE 'surely they overreact\", ONE intoxicated person or ONE person not noticing they have melted chocolate on their hands...\n\nYou are not obligated to do anything, but you should then be gracious to accept it if she decides it's not worth the stress and the risk to be present at your wedding.", "This is what the caterers at my sisters wedding did for me. I can\u2019t have seafood or tomatoes. Serious allergies. They were warned ahead of time so my salad and any other dishes (chicken instead of fish) could be prepared first and set aside covered and protected. \n\nI had no idea my sister had thought ahead for me and I  was so touched that she and my now BIL had. I never expected special treatment. Never have. My allergies, my problem. Called being an adult.", "We don't. We just say no thanks when someone offers us a piece \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, desert isn't a necessity.", "You hadn't thought about cross contamination with something that can kill your friend?", "similar thing happened with my friend\u2019s cousin\u2019s bride. She is severely allergic to dairy but luckily had a pastry chef in the family so the cake they cut into was a tofu based cheesecake while the guests had normal cake"]}
