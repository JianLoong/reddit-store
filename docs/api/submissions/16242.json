Thank you! \n\nI (26F) am getting married this winter. My fianc\u00e9 and I are super excited and we\u2019re beginning to plan out the menu for our reception. For context, I really love chocolate. I\u2019m sort of a chocolate fiend and one of my hobbies is going to chocolate shops and trying to find the best artisanal chocolates. My fianc\u00e9 and I actually met that way. Therefore, I\u2019m planning on having lots of chocolate desserts at the reception and our wedding cake is going to be chocolate as well. \n\nHowever, one of my bridesmaids (Eva) is severely allergic to chocolate. It\u2019s not an airborne allergy, but if she eats it it\u2019s serious enough that she\u2019ll go into anaphylaxis and possibly die. When my fianc\u00e9 and I were discussing the menu with the wedding party, she looked sort of upset. After the planning session, I pulled her aside and asked what was wrong. She told me that she felt like I wasn\u2019t taking into consideration her allergies when planning the wedding menu, and that she\u2019d prefer it if there were only a few or no chocolate desserts at all. \n\nI was sort of surprised since she\u2019s never had an issue with me eating chocolate around her before and I assured her there\u2019d be non-chocolate options as well for people with allergies or for just anyone who doesn\u2019t like chocolate. But she was still upset and said that it wasn\u2019t fair that 85% of the desserts would be chocolate and that she\u2019d feel left out if she couldn\u2019t participate in eating the wedding cake. She also brought up that the chocolate fountain we\u2019re planning to have might splash on the non chocolate desserts, and even though I told her that the chocolate and non chocolate options would be separated, she still looked upset.

Her allergies are accommodated by having non-chocolate options separated from chocolate ones.

This is your wedding, not hers. Plus, unless she's planning on taking a swim in that chocolate fountain, you've got nothing to worry about.

Or if that is not possibility I take my own snacks or food to eat safely. Sometimes it means I have to opt out from some celebrations like my cousin's birthday celebration with theme of apple harvest. I'm allergic to apples to point I can get anaphylaxis just from being in room with raw cut open apple (bake them or cook them and I can safely eat them). I just told no to the invite.", "NTA. You have multiple options that are suitable for her allergy and you've put thought into her safety with separating the allergen-free desserts.

You could easily turn it around to see who's more reasonable: If she was a true friend, she would be happy to have the non-chocolate desserts at your wedding, and not ask you to change your menu away from your preferences to please her.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and your making choices that make you and your fianc\u00e9 happy and that have significant meaning to you. You\u2019ve provided alternative arrangements, so your not in the wrong. \n\nAlso, I have to admit I don\u2019t remember the last time I actually ate the wedding cake at a wedding more than a bite or two.

Honestly I\u2019ve only had cake at maybe half the weddings I\u2019ve attended and this includes when I was in the wedding party.  And I LOVE cake. There\u2019s always a lot going on and I guess I just missed the cake cutting. Your friend can enjoy the non chocolate desserts or just skip dessert. It\u2019s not a human rights violation if she doesn\u2019t get cake. \n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible for a host to guarantee that catering won\u2019t cross contaminate things, but you can do your best to communicate this need. At that point the guests need to determine whether they are comfortable with the degree of care.  If your friend\u2019s allergy is severe she should be used to weighing the risks and have a plan for if the worst happens. \n\nMy niece has a latex allergy which was diagnosed in the mid 2000s before it was known that it was generally not dangerous for her to have food that might have been touched with latex gloves. Imagine asking at every restaurant if they used latex gloves. Kitchen workers speak multiple languages and communication was super difficult. Plus a lot of kitchens had a variety of gloves so you had no idea who was using what. My sister kept cupcakes in the freezer for my niece to take to birthday parties because she couldn\u2019t risk the cake. She even bought one to a wedding where my niece was flower girl. She learned to ask for the chef at restaurants and talk to them personally.  Thankfully it was later found that my niece didn\u2019t need to be so vigilant but what a challenge that was.", "NTA, OP, If Eva was a true friend, she would enjoy the variety of desserts that are available for her & enjoy seeing you have the wedding you want!", "Nta she can just... not eat it.", "Nta she just doesnt want to be the black sheep witch is understandable but its your wedding", "NTA. It's your wedding. You're going to have non chocolate options.  The only thing I would suggest is if possible, make one of the non chocolate options to be a smaller version of the wedding cake, so everyone can have a piece.\n\nIf she was a true friend she wouldn't expect you to redo your menu  just for her when you've already made accomodations for her.\n\nSince chocolate is a big thing for you and how you and part of the story of how you and your fiance met, chances are lots of people at the wedding will know this, chances are people will talk about it if you don't have chocolate. Does she really ewxpect you to field a bunch of questions/comments about you not having chocolate at your wedding?  Is she fine with you telling everyone you dodn't have chocolate because of her allergy? Would she feel comfortable with a note on the dessert table saying there's no chocolate due to a member of the bridal party having an allergy? Why didn't every guest get asked about allergies and food preferences? I mean I personally wouldn't say shit about a lack of chocolate at a wedding  but plenty of people would if they knew at least one of the couple was really in to chocolate. It's going to create a lot of stress probably if you give in to her demands. Which is what she is doing right now without coming out and saying it. She needs to get over herself and deal with the fact that there will be desserts she can eat, instead of focusing on the desserts she  doesn't want there.", "NTA. I thought you were going to say you were serving chocolate and only chocolate. Or that her allergy was severe enough that being around chocolate could trigger it. Sometimes having allergies or dietary restrictions means you miss out. That sucks but others aren\u2019t expected to bend over backwards for you. One of my bridesmaids is allergic to fish and shellfish. A friend of my husband is allergic to shellfish. We decided not to do shrimp as an appetizer during cocktail hour due to a higher probability of cross contamination. For dinner we wanted a fish option. I called my bridesmaid and asked if there were any precautions we should have our caterer take to make sure she was safe. She said just make sure they knew about her allergy so they would be extra careful plating her meal. She didn\u2019t insist on us leaving out any option she couldn\u2019t eat! You have already done enough by having non-chocolate options and ways to avoid cross contamination.\n\nEdit to add: I also love chocolate and am seriously jealous of all of your guests at your chocolate filled wedding!", "NTA.\n\nI rarely, if ever side with the bride, because... Bridezilla's are very real.  But you could absolutely assume any banquet to have some kind of chocolate. It's not like it's a new allergy for her either. I can't eat bananas, and I'm not going to flip out over a banana split bar.", "NTA. You are providing non chocolate desserts. MAYBE get a tray or two of mini cupcakes of various flavors just in case there are other people there who don\u2019t want chocolate cupcakes can have that. And definitely separate desserts.  That is enough. Is there a tiny risk. Yes but she also has equal risk going to the store or restaurants.\n\nSide note:  Asking for a friend can I come. \ud83d\ude00. I have always wanted to go to a place with a chocolate fountain. If you think of it after the wedding we all would love to see all the chocolate desserts pictures.", "Your wedding, your menu, your choices about what happens and is served at the reception. I've never heard of a wedding guest dictating what is served or not served at a reception and you shouldn't have to accommodate her since she can choose what to eat also.", "NTA. It's adorable how you and your fianc\u00e9 met and I love how you're making it such a theme at your wedding. \n\nYou're offering other alternatives and are aware of cross-contamination issues so you are making sure she (and others) are included. Don't redo the whole reception for one person. It's for YOU.", "NTA. It is not airborne, you are taking steps to minimize contamination (I would have the chocolate fountain on a separate table than the other desserts, if you can ). \n\nI am allergic to pineapple. If I even touch it, I breakout. I have never once in my life asked someone not to have it at their wedding. I just avoid it.\n\nAlso, I have been to a lot of weddings and eaten the cake at about half of them (and I really like cake). I asked my husband how many weddings he's eaten the cake at and his response was \"ours\".", "NTA. I've been a vegetarian for 30 years now and while allergies are a little different--she didn't choose her allergy--all she should ask is that you make some accommodation for her... and she ought to appreciate that extra effort! I certainly do, when I'm the annoying one with special needs. \n\nShe should not ask or want you to deprive yourself, that's not how friends treat one another.", "It\u2019s your wedding and is for you and your partner. Have what you want as it\u2019s your day and others should respect that and your decisions.", "NAH. You did put her in a shitty situation though. Majority of the things there could possible kill her and the risk of cross contamination would absolutely be high as hell. However, it\u2019s your wedding and you can whatever you want. If I was her, I would just attend the ceremony and not the reception", "Congrats on the pending wedding! Having a couple close family/friends with what can be life-threatening food allergies, I think cross-contamination is likely the biggest scare for her. If you eat a peanut and then touch my nephew's arm with your finger, he starts breaking out in severe hives. His insides do the same thing if he eats even the tiniest amount or breathes it in. There are only two vendors on all of Goldbelly who guarantee to be nut-free (and they're super yummy!).  My friends who limit gluten or dairy have also landed in the hospital with cross-contamination and someone assuring them what they were eating was nowhere near the stuff that can harm them. \n\nFor example, the allergen-free line at one of the dining halls on campus is free of the top eight allergens (gluten, nuts. dairy, soy, etc.) and has it's own area: separate staff, utensils, cleaning supplies, dish machine, pantry, cooking appliances, even their uniforms are cleaned separately than those for the rest of the staff. \n\nYou eating chocolate in front of her isn't the same as knowing there was no cross-contamination between prep surfaces, utensils, staff, etc. for the food that is supposed to be non-chocolate. It doesn't have to be something designated as chocolate to put her in danger. If the same caterer is making everything and they don't specifically guarantee no cross-contamination, that's a risk for her. No idea if her allergies are as severe as the folks I know.\n\nMaybe she just wants a better selection of desserts and to share your wedding cake on your special day. But maybe not--maybe she's worried about not being able to safely eat anything. Can you talk with her further to see what the issue is and how a compromise might be reached if you're so inclined?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is NOT a safety issue, there is NO risk for her health - so there is no need to be more inclusive. And: YOur parents are AHs, tell them to butt out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy are you even discussing this?", "I'm having a tough time with this one. It is your wedding, your day, your choices, and obviously chocolate is important in terms of how you met as well. No one should be demanding you change anything to suit them. That said, cross contamination is a huge issue with food allergies, so unless you've made the caterer very aware of the seriousness of her allergy and they have agreed to make the non-chocolate desserts completely separately and keep them in a separate location, I can understand her concern. I guess NAH, if you've taken those precautions.", "If I were her, I straight up would not go to your wedding. You don't seem to be concerned at all about cross contamination, which is extremely likely.\n\nUnless the catering team knows about the severe allergy, she won't be able to eat literally anything at your wedding without a high risk to her health and life.", "ESH\n\nYou - for knowingly making your bridesmaid feel as if she has a target on her back and will not be able to relax and enjoy the moment for fear of going into anaphylaxis.\n\nAnd her - because she has every right to step down as your bridesmaid and not attend an event that has the possible chance of killing her.", "YTA.

You\u2019ve also got a chocolate fountain so risk of airborne droplets of chocolate. \n\nThis is an anaphylactic shock allergy. IMO YTA if you do not, at minimum, ensure that your caterers are aware that there is a guest with analphylactic allergy to chocolate; that the kitchen needs to operate to prevent cross-contamination; that Eva has a separate plate provided that is prepared and separated in the kitchen, so she doesn\u2019t have to go near the buffet and risk contact with her allergen; and potentially that guests are aware that there is someone with an anaphylactic allergy to chocolate, so they know to be careful around the buffet / chocolate products. All it takes is a kid with chocolate fingers grabbing her hand. \n\nIf you care about someone enough to make them a bridesmaid, I would expect you to care enough about them to at least try to safeguard them knowing they are seriously allergic. Being a bridesmaid puts enormous pressure to attend, and you\u2019ve made your menu majority incompatible with her health. If I had an anaphylactic nut allergy, I wouldn\u2019t want to go to a wedding that was almost entirely nut-based, because I wouldn\u2019t want to risk my life.

And it's not an airborne(is it contact?) allergy.\n\nHonestly, your parents suck since they are only taking HER side because they don't like chocolate either.  Sheesh.\n\nSo if she didn't like purple and your parents didn't like purple and that was your bridesmaid dress theme, you should change it to her preference?  Nope.  Not on.", "Was totally prepared to give a YTA vote but NTA. You have accommodated her and separated the desserts so there isn\u2019t cross contamination, you\u2019ve done your due diligence. Does it suck to have an allergy and not be able to eat everything at an event? Yes. But it\u2019s a part of life when you have food allergies. \n\nIf the allergy was airborne and you were risking her health I\u2019d say you were the AH but that\u2019s not the case here.", "Nta. I have celiac and I would never expect somebody to have a gluten-free wedding. I just want to be fed. \n\n\nHeck, I never get dessert at all. if I could have 15% of desserts, if I could have one dessert, I would be thrilled!", "NTA, I think everything has been fairly commented on.\n\nBut I do feel sorry for Eva. That's the worst allergy that I could ever imagine. A life without chocolate sounds awful.", "NTA. Eva needs to get a grip.", "Sorry I think you are the AH. She might die. Enough said.", "I will need 100 percent of all desserts be to my liking. Thank you very much.", "I\u2019ve seen in the comments you mentioned the chocolate items have a separate caterer from the non-chocolate items & will have signs to avoid cross contamination. This is a great idea! \n\nCould you have your friend\u2019s food stuff stored in the kitchen somewhere safe to reassure her further?\n\nNTA because it\u2019s your wedding and chocolate is part of how you and your fianc\u00e9 met, but you\u2019re still trying to accommodate your friend!", "So long as you make sure there\u2019s no cross contamination between the chocolate and her food then I think NTA. \n\nOne of my best friends who was a bridesmaid to me has a dairy allergy and I am a cheese fiend. My venue was amazing about accommodating 5+ allergies and preferences. Any professional place will take cross contamination really seriously. She needs to be wary too, not get close to the chocolate fountain etc.", "NTA, but I might reconsider thechocolate cake, so she could participate? I know that it's your big day, and it's not a hill I'd personally die on, but a fruit and vanilla cake would be a little more inclusive, beyond just your friend.", "NTA, it sounds like there\u2019s options for everyone", "NTA- it\u2019s your wedding, not hers. You get to have what you want", "NTA It\u2019s your wedding so you can do what you want. However if you want to accommodate your friend more, you can actually do the reverse of most southern US weddings. There\u2019s usually a wedding cake that\u2019s usually white, vanilla or some other flavor. We also do a groom\u2019s cake that\u2019s usually chocolate. It used to be decorated with fresh fruit but now often features the groom\u2019s interest. Many times those wedding shaming pictures of wedding cakes featuring a car or sports team is actually a grooms cake. So you can do a chocolate wedding cake and a different grooms cake. If your budget allows, you can also do two chocolate fountains: one regular and one white.", "NTA. I don\u2019t care for chocolate. I love desserts! However, if you were my friend, I wouldn\u2019t have any problem with **100%** of your desserts being chocolate based.\n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s *your* wedding! I get that she\u2019s allergic but one night of no dessert wouldn\u2019t hurt her and you\u2019re not even asking that of her. You said you would have alternate options and she\u2019s being a brat.\n\nHave the menu that brings you and your fianc\u00e9 happiness. Congrats and best wishes for your marriage!", "NTA It's YOUR wedding. There are non chocolate options. Eva and your parents all need to get over themselves. It's not about them.", "NTA. I am also allergic to chocolate (though thankfully not anaphylactic), and I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to change their menu, especially when it\u2019s so important to you. Honestly, it\u2019s lovely of you to make sure there are non-chocolate options! But yeah, your wedding, your rules (within reason, and this is definitely within reason).", "Honestly as someone with a food allergy, I avoid everything it could potentially be placed in but at catered events without allergen protocols being followed during prep, transport, and serving, there\u2019s a much higher chance of becoming violently ill from something accidentally. \n\nTo put her mind at ease, make sure caterer will follow cross contamination protocols to keep everything separated. Further, get her a specialty desert she loves that can be guaranteed allergen free. If the concern is no wedding cake, maybe a decadent cake slice in her favorite flavor.", "As someone with a severe allergy, I would just not eat the desserts. I wouldn\u2019t expect the bride and groom to cater to my allergy. NTA\n\nSometimes, the bride/groom have informed that caterer about my allergy and if possible they have portioned dessert out separately for me in the kitchen to ensure no cross contamination. But I would never expect it", "How can a guest at a wedding ensure that the caterers and kitchen prepare their food in an allergen-free space and practice in a way to avoid cross-contamination? How can the guest at the wedding ensure that the buffet food available to them hasn\u2019t been cross-contaminated by guests? \n\nAllergies are absolutely the responsibility of hosts - it is appalling etiquette to not ask about (and therefore act upon) allergies when hosting any event, nevermind a wedding where it is an event that lasts all day and is expected to have food. And even moreso for someone *in the wedding party*.", "If she was a true friend, she would be willing to die for your happiness.", "Thanks for this thoughtful response! I think there is a gross misunderstanding of why this is an issue by people who don\u2019t have first hand experience with life threatening allergies. As someone with a few anaphylactic allergies, it\u2019s pretty disheartening to read some of these comments. I always liken an allergy to rat poison. How would the guests feel if a bunch of the food had been sprinkled with it? Sure, you can try your absolute best to avoid it, but knowing there\u2019s something lethal floating around makes an event pretty unpleasant to attend. \n\nIf her allergy is very severe, the thought of so many guests eating a lot of chocolate, and then leaning in for hugs/kisses, touching things like tables, chairs, door handles etc can be pretty daunting. It\u2019s one thing to manage if one friend or person beside you is eating something. When you have an allergy you\u2019re hyper vigilant about what everyone around you is eating all the time, and if they wash their hands or not, and what they touch afterwards. It\u2019s very hard to keep track of what\u2019s still \u201csafe\u201d (for example which people didn\u2019t eat chocolate, who do you feel comfortable hugging, which foods/surfaces managed to avoid cross contamination etc) after an entire room full of people have been touching and eating the thing that could kill you.\n\nTotally different story if the allergy isn\u2019t this severe and she just wants more food options. Typically I just eat before events or bring my own food. I\u2019m still hyper aware of what/who I\u2019m touching and make sure not to touch my mouth or eat before washing my hands. It\u2019s honestly pretty exhausting and I never expect anyone is going to be able to accommodate me all the time, but I would be pretty disappointed if a close friend or family member hosted a wedding with peanuts being a major theme.", "This is the answer IMO - alert the caterer and work with Eva in advance to ensure that there is a suitable dessert option for her that will be held aside to prevent any cross-contamination or any guests taking her portion. It might mean she has to pre-select one portion of dessert, and doesn\u2019t get the buffet experience other guests have, but IMO this is enough for OP to meet their moral obligations - they shouldn\u2019t have to change the menu for her as long as there is an agreeable option. \n\nDepends how far OP is willing to go with what that option is - it would be shitty if it was like, a fruit plate for Eva and a chocolate smorgasbord for everyone else, but if there\u2019s a couple of dessert options that won\u2019t be chocolate, then just holding aside a portion of each for Eva. \n\nBut I agree that actually, the caterers need to be involved in this from the get go - because so much of the menu will involve chocolate it\u2019s not going to be as simple as putting some macarons made in the one kitchen on a plate or whatever; they\u2019re going to have to make sure the non-chocolate options are prepared separately to the chocolate to prevent cross-contamination.", "Yes this is the way. At least have your caterer put a dessert or two aside for her and maybe even prepare her a dinner plate in advance as well just to be sure. At MOST ditch the chocolate fountain but I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s necessary.", "That\u2019s a good idea, there may be fruits etc for the chocolate fountain so it would be good if she could load her plate before anyone else got near just in case.", "Also you can just not have dessert. Does that suck? Yes, it absolutely does. But the night is for the bride and groom, and it seems like chocolate makes up a big part of it.", "I feel like it should be said, its not really 15% devoted to their dietary needs, its just being nice enough to not include a single ingredient in every single item. It would be like being lactose intolerant and going to a wedding that had cheese in 85% of their food.\n\nThat being said, I get and agree with your point.", "I do not agree with you at all. \n\nIf an allergy is so life threatening it is incumbent on the sufferer to protect themselves by assuming everything is probably cross-contaminated and should therefore bring their own, safe food with them. \n\nIt would be utter stupidity to shift that personal responsibility onto another person.", "A true friend could also simply skip dessert. Avoiding sweets really is possible; ask anyone on a keto diet.", "OP has stated the chocolate and non-choclate desserts are provided by two different sources.", "This is a really good idea, thank you! That way, we can avoid cross contamination. I\u2019ll pass it along to the caterer.", "We did this at our wedding with nuts. My nephew has a peanut allergy and we had a candy buffet that I knew I couldn't keep completely peanut-free, so my nephew got his own goodie bag of candy to enjoy (and we may have gone overboard).", "I think the issue is more splashes and spills. Having mostly chocolate desserts isn't an issue but one that could make chocolate get everywhere seems risky to me.", "True, but then there\u2019s also a member of the wedding party who will potentially have to pack her own lunch because she hasn\u2019t been assured the caterer has been instructed to take precautions.", "Only if the bread has been vaccinated.", "That sounds like an exercise in frustration. People are absolutely horrible at not messing that kind of thing up. \n\nJust have the caterer have a separate plate for the allergic bridesmaid. Much safer and easier too.", "Caterers are really accommodating most of the time. My SIL had Type 1 diabetes, and when her sister was getting married, the caterer fixed a plate ahead of time so she wouldn't have to worry about her blood sugar dipping while waiting in the buffet line.", "Caterers can be really cool about this too, since it\u2019s often not taken as a \u201cbridezilla\u201d move to be firm about it on behalf of others. I was aggressively firm about my friend\u2019s gluten allergy and cross contamination. And the caterers were VERY kind about it and helped assure me and show me that it was marked on every list and card and every opportunity to make sure it would be nearly impossible to give him gluten by accident. \n\nMy friend appreciated it a lot too, since a lot of people are shockingly dismissive or forgetful about allergies and intolerances, and he\u2019d had incidents at weddings in particular before where nobody on staff had been informed or the degree of careful necessary hadn\u2019t happened. \n\nThis last bit is probably why your friend is upset if this is not her typical behavior. Assure her you\u2019re going the extra mile with the caterers to be sure she has something just for her to eat safely. \n\nDoes she have a particular dessert she likes? If so, and you *really* extra want her to feel included and appreciated, maybe have one of the non chocolate options for her be that, so she feels like you really care. Because while yea it\u2019s your day, your wedding is also a way as a host to show that you and your spouse-to-be care for your friends and family too.", "I do think chocolate fountains are pretty gross. And you make a good point.", "Valid, perhaps the chocolate fountain should go.  Also I think they are kind of gross. What about single chocolate fondue servings - you could serve warm chocolate fondue in martini glasses with cut up fruit on a little wooden spear. It would be so cute!"]}
