Thank you! \n\nI (26F) am getting married this winter. My fianc\u00e9 and I are super excited and we\u2019re beginning to plan out the menu for our reception. For context, I really love chocolate. I\u2019m sort of a chocolate fiend and one of my hobbies is going to chocolate shops and trying to find the best artisanal chocolates. My fianc\u00e9 and I actually met that way. Therefore, I\u2019m planning on having lots of chocolate desserts at the reception and our wedding cake is going to be chocolate as well. \n\nHowever, one of my bridesmaids (Eva) is severely allergic to chocolate. It\u2019s not an airborne allergy, but if she eats it it\u2019s serious enough that she\u2019ll go into anaphylaxis and possibly die. When my fianc\u00e9 and I were discussing the menu with the wedding party, she looked sort of upset. After the planning session, I pulled her aside and asked what was wrong. She told me that she felt like I wasn\u2019t taking into consideration her allergies when planning the wedding menu, and that she\u2019d prefer it if there were only a few or no chocolate desserts at all. \n\nI was sort of surprised since she\u2019s never had an issue with me eating chocolate around her before and I assured her there\u2019d be non-chocolate options as well for people with allergies or for just anyone who doesn\u2019t like chocolate. But she was still upset and said that it wasn\u2019t fair that 85% of the desserts would be chocolate and that she\u2019d feel left out if she couldn\u2019t participate in eating the wedding cake. She also brought up that the chocolate fountain we\u2019re planning to have might splash on the non chocolate desserts, and even though I told her that the chocolate and non chocolate options would be separated, she still looked upset.

Her allergies are accommodated by having non-chocolate options separated from chocolate ones.

This is your wedding, not hers. Plus, unless she's planning on taking a swim in that chocolate fountain, you've got nothing to worry about.

Or if that is not possibility I take my own snacks or food to eat safely. Sometimes it means I have to opt out from some celebrations like my cousin's birthday celebration with theme of apple harvest. I'm allergic to apples to point I can get anaphylaxis just from being in room with raw cut open apple (bake them or cook them and I can safely eat them). I just told no to the invite.", "NTA. You have multiple options that are suitable for her allergy and you've put thought into her safety with separating the allergen-free desserts.

You could easily turn it around to see who's more reasonable: If she was a true friend, she would be happy to have the non-chocolate desserts at your wedding, and not ask you to change your menu away from your preferences to please her.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and your making choices that make you and your fianc\u00e9 happy and that have significant meaning to you. You\u2019ve provided alternative arrangements, so your not in the wrong. \n\nAlso, I have to admit I don\u2019t remember the last time I actually ate the wedding cake at a wedding more than a bite or two.

Honestly I\u2019ve only had cake at maybe half the weddings I\u2019ve attended and this includes when I was in the wedding party.  And I LOVE cake. There\u2019s always a lot going on and I guess I just missed the cake cutting. Your friend can enjoy the non chocolate desserts or just skip dessert. It\u2019s not a human rights violation if she doesn\u2019t get cake. \n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible for a host to guarantee that catering won\u2019t cross contaminate things, but you can do your best to communicate this need. At that point the guests need to determine whether they are comfortable with the degree of care.  If your friend\u2019s allergy is severe she should be used to weighing the risks and have a plan for if the worst happens. \n\nMy niece has a latex allergy which was diagnosed in the mid 2000s before it was known that it was generally not dangerous for her to have food that might have been touched with latex gloves. Imagine asking at every restaurant if they used latex gloves. Kitchen workers speak multiple languages and communication was super difficult. Plus a lot of kitchens had a variety of gloves so you had no idea who was using what. My sister kept cupcakes in the freezer for my niece to take to birthday parties because she couldn\u2019t risk the cake. She even bought one to a wedding where my niece was flower girl. She learned to ask for the chef at restaurants and talk to them personally.  Thankfully it was later found that my niece didn\u2019t need to be so vigilant but what a challenge that was.", "NTA, OP, If Eva was a true friend, she would enjoy the variety of desserts that are available for her & enjoy seeing you have the wedding you want!", "Nta she can just... not eat it.", "Nta she just doesnt want to be the black sheep witch is understandable but its your wedding", "NTA. It's your wedding. You're going to have non chocolate options.  The only thing I would suggest is if possible, make one of the non chocolate options to be a smaller version of the wedding cake, so everyone can have a piece.\n\nIf she was a true friend she wouldn't expect you to redo your menu  just for her when you've already made accomodations for her.\n\nSince chocolate is a big thing for you and how you and part of the story of how you and your fiance met, chances are lots of people at the wedding will know this, chances are people will talk about it if you don't have chocolate. Does she really ewxpect you to field a bunch of questions/comments about you not having chocolate at your wedding?  Is she fine with you telling everyone you dodn't have chocolate because of her allergy? Would she feel comfortable with a note on the dessert table saying there's no chocolate due to a member of the bridal party having an allergy? Why didn't every guest get asked about allergies and food preferences? I mean I personally wouldn't say shit about a lack of chocolate at a wedding  but plenty of people would if they knew at least one of the couple was really in to chocolate. It's going to create a lot of stress probably if you give in to her demands. Which is what she is doing right now without coming out and saying it. She needs to get over herself and deal with the fact that there will be desserts she can eat, instead of focusing on the desserts she  doesn't want there.", "NTA. I thought you were going to say you were serving chocolate and only chocolate. Or that her allergy was severe enough that being around chocolate could trigger it. Sometimes having allergies or dietary restrictions means you miss out. That sucks but others aren\u2019t expected to bend over backwards for you. One of my bridesmaids is allergic to fish and shellfish. A friend of my husband is allergic to shellfish. We decided not to do shrimp as an appetizer during cocktail hour due to a higher probability of cross contamination. For dinner we wanted a fish option. I called my bridesmaid and asked if there were any precautions we should have our caterer take to make sure she was safe. She said just make sure they knew about her allergy so they would be extra careful plating her meal. She didn\u2019t insist on us leaving out any option she couldn\u2019t eat! You have already done enough by having non-chocolate options and ways to avoid cross contamination.\n\nEdit to add: I also love chocolate and am seriously jealous of all of your guests at your chocolate filled wedding!", "NTA.\n\nI rarely, if ever side with the bride, because... Bridezilla's are very real.  But you could absolutely assume any banquet to have some kind of chocolate. It's not like it's a new allergy for her either. I can't eat bananas, and I'm not going to flip out over a banana split bar.", "NTA. You are providing non chocolate desserts. MAYBE get a tray or two of mini cupcakes of various flavors just in case there are other people there who don\u2019t want chocolate cupcakes can have that. And definitely separate desserts.  That is enough. Is there a tiny risk. Yes but she also has equal risk going to the store or restaurants.\n\nSide note:  Asking for a friend can I come. \ud83d\ude00. I have always wanted to go to a place with a chocolate fountain. If you think of it after the wedding we all would love to see all the chocolate desserts pictures.", "Your wedding, your menu, your choices about what happens and is served at the reception. I've never heard of a wedding guest dictating what is served or not served at a reception and you shouldn't have to accommodate her since she can choose what to eat also.", "NTA. It's adorable how you and your fianc\u00e9 met and I love how you're making it such a theme at your wedding. \n\nYou're offering other alternatives and are aware of cross-contamination issues so you are making sure she (and others) are included. Don't redo the whole reception for one person. It's for YOU.", "NTA. It is not airborne, you are taking steps to minimize contamination (I would have the chocolate fountain on a separate table than the other desserts, if you can ). \n\nI am allergic to pineapple. If I even touch it, I breakout. I have never once in my life asked someone not to have it at their wedding. I just avoid it.\n\nAlso, I have been to a lot of weddings and eaten the cake at about half of them (and I really like cake). I asked my husband how many weddings he's eaten the cake at and his response was \"ours\".", "NTA. I've been a vegetarian for 30 years now and while allergies are a little different--she didn't choose her allergy--all she should ask is that you make some accommodation for her... and she ought to appreciate that extra effort! I certainly do, when I'm the annoying one with special needs. \n\nShe should not ask or want you to deprive yourself, that's not how friends treat one another.", "It\u2019s your wedding and is for you and your partner. Have what you want as it\u2019s your day and others should respect that and your decisions.", "NAH. You did put her in a shitty situation though. Majority of the things there could possible kill her and the risk of cross contamination would absolutely be high as hell. However, it\u2019s your wedding and you can whatever you want. If I was her, I would just attend the ceremony and not the reception", "Congrats on the pending wedding! Having a couple close family/friends with what can be life-threatening food allergies, I think cross-contamination is likely the biggest scare for her. If you eat a peanut and then touch my nephew's arm with your finger, he starts breaking out in severe hives. His insides do the same thing if he eats even the tiniest amount or breathes it in. There are only two vendors on all of Goldbelly who guarantee to be nut-free (and they're super yummy!).  My friends who limit gluten or dairy have also landed in the hospital with cross-contamination and someone assuring them what they were eating was nowhere near the stuff that can harm them. \n\nFor example, the allergen-free line at one of the dining halls on campus is free of the top eight allergens (gluten, nuts. dairy, soy, etc.) and has it's own area: separate staff, utensils, cleaning supplies, dish machine, pantry, cooking appliances, even their uniforms are cleaned separately than those for the rest of the staff. \n\nYou eating chocolate in front of her isn't the same as knowing there was no cross-contamination between prep surfaces, utensils, staff, etc. for the food that is supposed to be non-chocolate. It doesn't have to be something designated as chocolate to put her in danger. If the same caterer is making everything and they don't specifically guarantee no cross-contamination, that's a risk for her. No idea if her allergies are as severe as the folks I know.\n\nMaybe she just wants a better selection of desserts and to share your wedding cake on your special day. But maybe not--maybe she's worried about not being able to safely eat anything. Can you talk with her further to see what the issue is and how a compromise might be reached if you're so inclined?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is NOT a safety issue, there is NO risk for her health - so there is no need to be more inclusive. And: YOur parents are AHs, tell them to butt out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy are you even discussing this?", "I'm having a tough time with this one. It is your wedding, your day, your choices, and obviously chocolate is important in terms of how you met as well. No one should be demanding you change anything to suit them. That said, cross contamination is a huge issue with food allergies, so unless you've made the caterer very aware of the seriousness of her allergy and they have agreed to make the non-chocolate desserts completely separately and keep them in a separate location, I can understand her concern. I guess NAH, if you've taken those precautions.", "If I were her, I straight up would not go to your wedding. You don't seem to be concerned at all about cross contamination, which is extremely likely.\n\nUnless the catering team knows about the severe allergy, she won't be able to eat literally anything at your wedding without a high risk to her health and life.", "ESH\n\nYou - for knowingly making your bridesmaid feel as if she has a target on her back and will not be able to relax and enjoy the moment for fear of going into anaphylaxis.\n\nAnd her - because she has every right to step down as your bridesmaid and not attend an event that has the possible chance of killing her.", "YTA.
