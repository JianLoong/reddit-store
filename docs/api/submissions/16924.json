My neice is fifteen, and she's a good swimmer. I probably wouldn't have even minded if it was just her and one or two others but there were 8 of them and I don't know any of her friends or if they're strong swimmers, and in that situation they could still easily be having fun and miss out on someone struggling. I just stayed in my house and kept and eye on them. But afterwards I called her mom and said I was really uncomfortable with the situation. SIL brushed me off and said it's not unreasonable and would be \"weird\" if her and her husband babysat a whole bunch of teens and would embarrassing for her and blamed me because they don't have access to the house when they're over if we're not home. I got really annoyed and said I need her to promise me this won't happen again and she just straight up wouldn't. My husband and I talked it over and decided to change the backyard lock and texted all of our his siblings that we're sorry but pools only open when we're home from now on. \n\nNow my BIL and his wife are annoyed because \"we didn't do anything wrong\" and most of the time when they want to swim at our house we're not going to be home (I work mostly on weekends and my husband is out of state two weeks at a time). My husband says we should just give them a copy of the new key but I actually think it's probably time we put a stop to the whole thing anyway. My husband argues no way would his brother send his kids without supervision (they're all under five and he's not a terrible dad) but I'm just kind of over it all together especially since I'm always the one picking up the pool toys and putting patio furniture back and stuff after they're over. \n\nMy husband I think just wants his brother to stop texting him about it but for me it's kind of just making me dig my heels in harder because it's starting to be like using our pool is some kind of human right vs. a nice favor we've been doing for them at our expense.

But when you get to the hospital they ask where the accident occurred.
