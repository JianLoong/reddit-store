SIL brushed me off and said it's not unreasonable and would be \"weird\" if her and her husband babysat a whole bunch of teens and would embarrassing for her and blamed me because they don't have access to the house when they're over if we're not home. I got really annoyed and said I need her to promise me this won't happen again and she just straight up wouldn't. My husband and I talked it over and decided to change the backyard lock and texted all of our his siblings that we're sorry but pools only open when we're home from now on. \n\nNow my BIL and his wife are annoyed because \"we didn't do anything wrong\" and most of the time when they want to swim at our house we're not going to be home (I work mostly on weekends and my husband is out of state two weeks at a time).

It\u2019s not super easy to pull off (especially if you\u2019re physically voluptuous in any way), and the board is preferred if they\u2019re face up but it is done to minimise damage while also preventing drowning. Once they\u2019re face up you can use the buoyancy of the water and the tightest grip from hand to elbow down the spine (to bring them to shallower water if necessary) before transfer to the board. \n\nWorth learning as part of a water lifesaving course - a lot of double drownings happen because someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing tries to rescue someone but they both end up in trouble. Advice: where possible, throw a floatation device first, rescues that require physical contact are most dangerous, and if you have to get in the water, try to take a noodle or floater of some kind that they can grab onto.
