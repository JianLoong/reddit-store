Our one rule has always been that an adult has to be in the backyard with them. I've never changed this rule or put an \"age out\" clause on this rule. \n\nI came home a few weeks ago and my neice and a few of her friends were at the pool. My neice is fifteen, and she's a good swimmer. I probably wouldn't have even minded if it was just her and one or two others but there were 8 of them and I don't know any of her friends or if they're strong swimmers, and in that situation they could still easily be having fun and miss out on someone struggling. I just stayed in my house and kept and eye on them. But afterwards I called her mom and said I was really uncomfortable with the situation. SIL brushed me off and said it's not unreasonable and would be \"weird\" if her and her husband babysat a whole bunch of teens and would embarrassing for her and blamed me because they don't have access to the house when they're over if we're not home. I got really annoyed and said I need her to promise me this won't happen again and she just straight up wouldn't. My husband and I talked it over and decided to change the backyard lock and texted all of our his siblings that we're sorry but pools only open when we're home from now on. \n\nNow my BIL and his wife are annoyed because \"we didn't do anything wrong\" and most of the time when they want to swim at our house we're not going to be home (I work mostly on weekends and my husband is out of state two weeks at a time). My husband says we should just give them a copy of the new key but I actually think it's probably time we put a stop to the whole thing anyway. My husband argues no way would his brother send his kids without supervision (they're all under five and he's not a terrible dad) but I'm just kind of over it all together especially since I'm always the one picking up the pool toys and putting patio furniture back and stuff after they're over. \n\nMy husband I think just wants his brother to stop texting him about it but for me it's kind of just making me dig my heels in harder because it's starting to be like using our pool is some kind of human right vs. a nice favor we've been doing for them at our expense.

It\u2019s not super easy to pull off (especially if you\u2019re physically voluptuous in any way), and the board is preferred if they\u2019re face up but it is done to minimise damage while also preventing drowning.

Advice: where possible, throw a floatation device first, rescues that require physical contact are most dangerous, and if you have to get in the water, try to take a noodle or floater of some kind that they can grab onto.

Wow, your SIL is a piece of work. SHE will decide your pool rules? What?! Her sense of entitlement is astounding. I'm on the fence about not letting the other sibling's family use the pool. That being said, you need to post in clear view (on pool gate and back door) rules to follow including \"no child under the age of 18 is to be without their parent's direct supervision.\"   And \"parents assume all responsibility and liabilities\". This sign is needed even while they swim when you're home. These rules will not allow for parents to pop out to the store or even settle inside your home to watch tv. Neither parent outside? Kids get out if pool. It doesn't negate liability but it will limit it", "NTA.  Your house, your rules.", "Your pool. Your responsibility. Your rules. \n\nAside from the strong possibility of one of these kids getting hurt and the parents suing, imagine the position you would be in if neighbours complained about noise, police came and found a group of teens drinking. Guess who would be held responsible? One of the kids' parents could also complain about you allowing underage drinking on your property. I don't know what the laws are like in your country, but in mine you would end up in deep doo doo.", "NTA\n\nFirst, you and your husband pay extra for insurance for a pool and any accidents are your responsibility.\n\nSecond, you had a boundary set up and in place. Those boundaries are being ignored and trampled on. Time to make sure everyone knows that violating those has consequences.\n\nTime for your in-laws to invest in their own pool if you are being so unreasonable.", "I had a party for my kid's sports team with our pool.  So we had a number of similarly aged kids and size of group mentioned.  While fun,  it was also one of the most stressful couple of hours in my life to rein in the kids from doing crazy backflips, dives, and stupid, dangerous crap in general.  And that was while I was watching.  I can't imagine the shenanigans had I not been there.   Pools have an incredible amount of responsibility.  People who don't understand or respect such responsibility absolutely should not use your pool.  There are plenty of public pool and gym options they can use instead.", "NTA. Stop it now. I had a similar situation 13 years back. We do have a nice home with a swimming pool with the difference that we don't have external access. You have to enter the house to use the swimming pool as my backyard has no access from the street. Also, swimming pools in my area are not common in most houses so I was happy to share at first but my husband's family used to come so often that I started to hate warmer summer months because I knew I had to have all these people around, with their kids, all afternoon without any consideration to our rest, working hours and our time and private life in general. Week days or weekends. It came to a point where one of these relatives demanded to enter the house even if we were away because the children wanted to use the pool when maybe we were away on a Sunday out for lunch and they expected us to come back home inmediatly if the children felt like swimming. They would arrive without calling and leave late in the day most of the times. After I got pregnant I decided to cut this completely and they all got furious with us. As someone said, privilege becomes entitlement for some people before you know it and I decided I don't want these people around. Your house, your rules. I was afraid to upset people and instead, it was me who was upset and angryall the time (Also, nobody picked up things and the mess would be left behind)No more. Swimming pool is only for the family (my family who lives in the house) and friends if invite first. After all this years people stopped to ask alltogether, they know the answer.", "NTA, totally bring the beer and other party favs to the friends open no parent pool party.", "I know someone who became a paraplegic after a shallow dive....so definitely a concern. He also died much earlier due to complications from his paralysis.", "I have a pool, and THIS IS CORRECT!!

Stand your ground.", "NTA there's liability issues and also the whole issue of strange people-teens-around your house. just explain that you had rules and someone broke them and refuses to agree to they spoiled it for everyone else.", "This!  Many people are underinsured for the kind of lawsuits that can result from a pool-related spinal cord injury.  Ask the insurance agent what would happen if a teen were injured in your pool and their family sued, how much are you protected for? The medical costs for those injuries are life-long and exceed millions of dollars.  If your insurance agent can quantify the financial risk for your husband, maybe he\u2019ll come around to agreeing that it\u2019s time to end the free for all.", "Perfect answer", "Only one of the siblings broke the rules though. Obviously they don't have to let anyone use the pool if they don't want to, but I don't understand why they can't just revoke the privileges of the SIL who was disrespectful, and not the BIL who quite literally didn't do anything wrong (and OP admits they think wouldn't do anything wrong). Seems weird to punish everyone when only one person made a mistake", "> you need to take your husband's views into account it's his pool as well\n\nAbsolutely not, unless his views accept that he (and not OP) will be legally and financially responsible for whatever happens to the children if something goes wrong.", "OP being away a lot is what concerns me. An unattended pool with the owners out of town is just screaming out for a wild party. OP you should install cameras and an alarm because the kids will find a way in if they really want to get in.", "NTA- You should also post no trespassing signs to further protect yourself.", "This is a good point too!", "Nice BIL isn\u2019t all that nice if he is making such a fuss about it that her husband is getting annoyed with he badgering.", "Agreed, the SIL family got 15 years of pool access it's hardly fair to them.

Make sure she/they know that they don\u2019t have access just because you\u2019re home, they actually have to get permission every time they come. \n\nAs for the BIL and his family. I get your husband wanting to give him a key and continue to allow him to use the pool since his family wasn\u2019t involved, but if you decide to do that you should make it clear that he is not to allow SIL and her family to join him AND he is to clean up before he leaves so that it is left as he found it (or better). First time you have to clean up after him or you find out he shared access with his sister, I\u2019d pull his key again and for good. That\u2019s assuming you want to give him access, which you are under no obligation to do.", "NTA it\u2019s not crazy for your SIL to let teens swim at her house when she\u2019s not home, but that\u2019s her insurance and liability. You\u2019re not an AH for feeling uncomfortable with it. She\u2019s out of line for refusing to make concessions and thinking you\u2019re the problem. A compromise could have been reached (only 2 guests, they pay for a camera, etc) but she didn\u2019t even try. It\u2019s the lack of respect.

They said that they didn\u2019t want to do so, and that it was just about getting money for future medical expenses. All of this happened in an extremely small and generally poor town, and there was considerable ill will over the whole thing\u2026 mostly centered on *your boy was an idiot*, *getting blood from a stone*, and *gonna raise everyone\u2019s insurance rates*. The boy\u2019s family moved shortly after in part for access to better medical support but also because the town was just mad. Accidents happen, but this was not that. \n\nHaving an adult home at the time the kid dove into the pool wouldn\u2019t have stopped him unless someone saw him doing it (other than the other teens present\u2026) AND was able to get his attention before he did it.

If you lay down the law and rules for everyone AND they agree (including the insistance they clean up so it looks the way you left it) then they can use it.

You're doing the right thing.", "Nta", "NTA", "NAH.\n\nYour property. Your pool. Your boundaries. No one has the right to insist that you let them use your pool when you aren't home.\n\nSIL is clearly the biggest offender. She's the one who allowed minors to use your pool without adult supervision. If that never happened, you presumably would have been annoyed about having to clean up after your inconsiderate guests but would likely not have revoked everyone's pool privileges.\n\nSo that's what I suggest you focus on. What would you require in order to consider giving BIL's family some pool privileges back? Perhaps them making and honoring a commitment to always provide adult supervision and to clean up after themselves would suffice. And, of course, if you find out they've allowed anyone else to use or copy the pool key their privileges would be permanently revoked immediately.", "NTA. Have your husband contact the home insurance company and run the scenario past them. Chances are-the company would want to drop y\u2019all as clients.", "NTA,\n\nTHis is a recipe for disaster if you give them a key. First you are responsible if anyone gets hurt in your pool. Your SIL doesn't care because it won't be her ass in trouble if her kid's friend drowns. You will be, and no clue how true this is but you might also get criminal charges for negligence? \n\nIn addition, your IL seem entitled to their pool. Are they contributing at all to its costs? Insurance? Anything? \n\nI would love to get a pool but the cost of maintenance and everything just puts me off. I would love to have access to a free pool that a family/friend owned, and you better believe me that if I did then I would never leave anything for OP for clean up and would contribute money, and if declined then bring over steaks and stuff for them.", "NTA they totally are taking advantage of you. Hosting a 15 year olds pool party with no supervision is a tragedy waiting to happen. Your pool, your rules", "NTA. Public pools are a thing. Your BIL should either look into one, or get a small pool or sprinkler for his kids. Y'all should also say what prompted this change.", "NTA. \n\nEven barring all the other issues about liability etc, the fact that you approached your SIL and said I\u2019m uncomfortable with this and she basically said, too bad, is enough for me to say no for all future use without a homeowner present. \n\nShe\u2019s treating a gift and a privilege like a right. And that\u2019s enough grounds to revoke it.", "So not NTA. Your BIL and SIL see nothing wrong with giving a bunch of kids you don't even know access to your pool, as long as it means *they* don't have to entertain them ... and they think they should be give free rein to your house as well? I can't even with that. That's some next level entitlement right there, and cutting that off at the source is absolutely the right way to go.", "Rescuing someone with a spinal injury from deep water is one of the hardest things that a lifeguard can do. This video shows the full procedure https://youtu.be/wZbmTHJiUgQ\n\nIn my lifeguard training, we spent an entire class drilling on how to do it, rotating roles. Until it becomes muscle memory and you don't have to think as much about it. The best and safest pools and beaches make their lifeguards practice backboarding during slow days", "Yes it makes sense but I think it's just because I'm not American that I find the comment so weird. In England we'd generally just be worried about someone drowing in our pool (although hardly anyone has a pool here!) and our thoughts wouldn't immediately go to insurance issues.", "NTA. Nope. The liability on this is giving me anxiety. You would be sued into your next life by one of the parents of the teens so fast. Not your SIL. YOU. Is your husband ready to take that on?", "NTA. For reasons of liability, not to mention avoiding the absolute mental hell of knowing someone was hurt or killed on your property. \n\nI once really, REALLY pissed off my husband by not allowing my 5yo and 6yo children to go (without us) on a huge multi-family vacation with 28 people spread out between two houses. Those two houses had an unfenced pool in between. I was 29 weeks into a high risk pregnancy and had been advised not to go. My husband really REALLY wanted to go but his pride would not allow him to leave me behind even though I would have been fine (appearances and all). He didn\u2019t want to be seen as \u201cthe guy that left his pregnant wife at home\u201d but unless he went on the trip, I was not gonna let my kids go. 28 adults drinking and carousing do not make for adequate child supervision around a pool, not to mention the open ocean 150 yards away. You can\u2019t undo a drowning, and they happen SO fast. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to feel comfortable with that situation. His whole family was full of disdain at my decision, but you CANNOT take chances with children and water! Older kids may be strong swimmers and seem OK, but all it takes is overconfidence or a bonk on the head to have a tragedy.", "NTA There might be a solution. Instead of being casual about the rules, ask your BIL and his wife to sign an agreement listing all the terms. Tell them that you were upset about what happened before and just want to make sure the terms are clear. Make it clear that they have to clean up, that the parents have to supervise, that there are no guests allowed, etc.", "As someone with a pool and relatives I can assure you that you are liable for anything that happens to anyone in that pool. My brother once dove in and hit his face on the bottom of the pool\u2026.has we not been there to save him\u2026he would be dead right now as the two kids with him could not have pulled a grown man out of the pool.", "I think it's best to stop letting anyone use your pool when you're not home. Period.", "NTA. Your house, your rules.", "\"SIL brushed me off and said it's not unreasonable and would be \"weird\" if her and her husband babysat a whole bunch of teens and would embarrassing for her.\"\n\nNTA. You know what would also be \"embarrassing for her? Having to explain to her daughter's friend's mother why their child is dead.", "We had a pool in our back yard and the rule was always to have an adult present. When the kids were you and what Ed play dates the parent had to come and be with the child. As they grew up again I had to be home if any kids including my own to be able to go in the pool. When they were seventeen the rules changed that my kids could not be in the pool alone I didn\u2019t want anyone to be in the pool alone if the somehow bump their head or slipped. Yes you as the owner are liable if anyone gets hurt. And yes they can sue you.", "NTA. It always amazes me how flippant some people are around water. It\u2019s your pool, and you\u2019re liable for anything that happens. Shoot, at the pool I belong to, kids under 16 have to be accompanied by an adult\u2026and that at a pool with lifeguards!!", "Your IL's won't be the ones being sued parents the parents of those kids. Some states have very specific laws for pools. I wouldn't allow unattended swimmers. I don't care what anybody else thinks. Mention the liability issues to your husband. NTA", "We had a pool for years and were very happy to share it\u2026but! It gets old being the one to pick up, clean up, store, feed, hydrate, and entertain everyone. We moved and never saw most of the people hanging out at the pool.", "Nta", "NTA. Even if it weren't for the safety issue, I don't want a bunch of 15 year olds I don't know at my house unsupervised.", "OP, what ever happened to simple gratitude\u2026being thankful when someone, anyone, does a great favor for you? And to be sure, you and hubby were doing a great favor for his brother and children. Now they pressure you because they don\u2019t want to follow your wholly sensible and justified rule about adult supervision while children use your pool while you are not at home. Unfriggenbelievable!\n\nBy the way did the in-laws/relatives offer some kind of gift or, even, a heartfelt thank you EACH time they use the pool? I\u2019ll bet not. OP, they use you and if you give them a new key to your pool, you and hubby deserve what you get from them: entitled and thankless abusers of your good graces.\n\nI understand your husband\u2019s reluctance to cut his brother\u2019s kids out of their \u201cdeserved,\u201d but not deserved, pool party but does he realize the risks taken on your property? It\u2019s not only drowning but also slipping on a wet deck and cracking your head on the concrete. Yes, relatives are not supposed to sue relatives but they do and SIL seems to have just the right amount of gall to do such a thing should one of her kids do that head cracking.\n\nAnd what about the niece\u2019s/nephew\u2019sfriends wholly unrelated to you? How sure are you that THEIR parents won\u2019t sue you over an injury? \n\nYou could lose your home OP.", "NTA. \n\nKeeping the pool open for them to use it when you guys aren\u2019t home is essentially a guarantee for teens to drink/smoke weed and do stupid shit, and possibly get into an accident. When it does (IANAL), the blame sits on your shoulders.", "Most definitely NTA. The liability this could turn into is enough to say absolutely not! What would of happened if one of those teenagers got hurt or drowned? Their parents would of been suing you, but your in laws! And the in laws with the smaller children who don\u2019t know how to clean up after themselves don\u2019t get access to something they don\u2019t respect. Stand firm!", "I wouldn't even show up unless I let them know I was coming, even with a key. I would also make sure to clean up after myself. \n\nI take care of my brother's house when he's on vacation. He has a pool I can use. I always put everything back where I found it. The only thing I ever left out was my suit and towel to dry.", "It didn\u2019t drive the change exactly but OP specifically said she was glad of the excuse since she\u2019s tired of cleaning up. My uncle has a pool which I\u2019ve used a few times with my kids. We ALWAYS put his pool toys away and leave it exactly as we found it (or neater) because that\u2019s the least you can do when someone lets you use their stuff. BIL sounds like the guy who gives you your car back on empty after borrowing it.", "NTA", "NTA But a compromise for you and hubby could be to put a code on the pool gate instead of a key. That way they can ask when you're gone, but they won't be able to get in without an ok (downside being you'd have to change the code a lot so they keep having to ask for the new one).", "NTA\n\nYou need to remind your husband that the 2 of you are liable if anything were to ever happen and you can't honestly pick and choose which family can have a key without it blowing up even worse than it has already.\n\nHe can easily make his brother stop texting. He tells him that he said no and that's end of story and don't text about it again. \n\nAnd if they all stop coming around and/or stay upset, then you both know it was only ever about using your pool and not because your family who they genuinely care about.", "I'm dropping another comment just in case OP is still reading these because this just occurred to me: If an accident happens when you're not home you'll have to tell your homeowners insurance what happened. They will basically flip shit  that you are letting people use your homes biggest liability when you are not there and may revoke your insurance! If you cannot get insured THE BANK CAN REVOKE YOUR LOAN, or demand payment of loan in full. You have to have home insurance when you have a home loan! It's a requirement! \n\nThis has much bigger stakes than just people can't cool off whenever they want! Definitely don't give anyone keys! We also don't know how vindictive the SIL that caused the problem is...you don't want her calling your homeowners insurance if you give brother a new key and not her!", "NTA and this is a massive liability problem. If someone gets hurts or drowns in your pool, you\u2019ll be legally responsible regardless of who is supervised or not. \n\nChange the locks, install cameras.", "Tell them you are getting ring cameras installed in high up, various areas facing the pool and as soon as you get notification on your cell that someone is in your backyard, the police will be called.", "Good judgement of the situation, they are treating it like they deserve it, not that you are doing something nice for them. This is a hill to die on, for sure.", "Heh, neither am I. I am merciless when it comes to protecting my family's interests. I like to think that I am one of the nicest people you can meet... unless you push me."]}
