SIL brushed me off and said it's not unreasonable and would be \"weird\" if her and her husband babysat a whole bunch of teens and would embarrassing for her and blamed me because they don't have access to the house when they're over if we're not home. I got really annoyed and said I need her to promise me this won't happen again and she just straight up wouldn't. My husband and I talked it over and decided to change the backyard lock and texted all of our his siblings that we're sorry but pools only open when we're home from now on. \n\nNow my BIL and his wife are annoyed because \"we didn't do anything wrong\" and most of the time when they want to swim at our house we're not going to be home (I work mostly on weekends and my husband is out of state two weeks at a time).

I was picked up by my parents and just laid in bed for a bit (it was the 1980\u2019s) before they finally took me to an urgent care. I remember it hurt to breathe. I got X-rays and was told the cartilage between my vertebrae was knocked askew. I was bed ridden for a couple days, but was ok. \n\nTLDR Spinal injuries can happen easily in many ways.", "This, all of it.", "Disagree, BIL always leaving his kids toys all over the place for OP to get stuck picking up is also wrong, he was getting free access to a private pool for his kids so the least he could do was pick up after them", "Initially no, it was a situation which had never occurred. What was wrong was completely disregarding that she under no circumstances wanted this situation to happen again. What drove the change is when her SIL could not even be respectful of what she wanted in the future and her boundaties. It was minimizing behavior followed by outright defiance of her explicit rules. So yea. They were wrong.", "No Americans are sue happy.  We never let anyone access our homes and property.\n\n\nPlus most Americans are entitled. If you let family use your pool you come home to your neice having and unsupervised pool party in your back yard. And the excuse will be but where family you shouldn\u2019t mind! \n\nSo take away is don\u2019t be nice to family or they steamroll all over your boundaries", "That\u2019s because people sue all the time for literally anything and everything. Sometimes just out of spite. \n\nBut in our country, it\u2019s likely that even with a fence, pool cover, and cameras that if something happened, op would still end up having to pay in some way. \n\nPool ownership is do fickle with insurance companies and they\u2019ll find any reason to not pay out. \n\nThere was a story not long ago of a mom who let her child pull a small ladder over and hope their fence. She got her leg caught swinging it over and broke her arm. Of course despite multiple police reports of trespassing, constant talks with the mom, camera evidence, etc the mom was demanding compensation and it did go to court with them needing a lawyer. \n\nNo, the mom didn\u2019t win, but do you see how much of a hassle handling that was?", "The US is a litigious society, others here have expanded on that. Plus having something happen and dealing with home insurance and all that goes with it is a pain in the rear.", "If someone is just struggling, you can pretty much just yank them out of the water in a variety of ways. If there's a suspected spinal injury, you backboard them, which involves immobilizing them on a board (that floats) so they can't move their neck or head and make things worse. Then you pull the board out of the water and because the person is strapped down on it, they come out in a straight line instead of flopping about and worsening the potential injury.", "There is a special board that lifeguards have access to and they are trained in how to use it as to keep the swimmer immobilized as they are being removed from the water. It has a way to secure the head so it cannot move and to secure the swimmer to the board so they cannot move their bodies either.", "Okay, but since that didn't drive the role change, I think a conversation probably would have handled that. And if it didn't, then bil gets banned too.", "I don't think the bil is married to the sil. Sil has a teen. All of bil 's kids are under 5. So bil's kids have never been unattended, and op said she didn't think bill would ever do that.", "The board is preferable, if there\u2019s one available, but if they\u2019re face down and you have to flip them quick so they don\u2019t drown, there\u2019s a technique or two to use your body as the board, while holding their neck and upper spine as tight as humanly possible, and rotating them in that position by rotating under them (without lifting them of course). It\u2019s not super easy to pull off (especially if you\u2019re physically voluptuous in any way), and the board is preferred if they\u2019re face up but it is done to minimise damage while also preventing drowning. Once they\u2019re face up you can use the buoyancy of the water and the tightest grip from hand to elbow down the spine (to bring them to shallower water if necessary) before transfer to the board. \n\nWorth learning as part of a water lifesaving course - a lot of double drownings happen because someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing tries to rescue someone but they both end up in trouble. Advice: where possible, throw a rope or floatation device first, rescues that require physical contact are most dangerous, and if you have to get in the water, try to take a noodle or floater of some kind that they can grab onto. A drowning person will instinctually do whatever they can to not drown. Including grab and use the person that\u2019s come to help as a floatation device. We learn aquatic self defence techniques as well for if that happens.", "Yes but insurance is more likely to cover the cost where as if they are unsupervised by the land owner and they have a key. It\u2019s a loophole for the insurance to get out of paying."]}
