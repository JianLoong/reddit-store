We\u2019ll call my brother K and my nephew L. \n\nL was diagnosed with autism at the age of 2 and is for the most part non verbal, hyperactive and overall a great kid to be around. He\u2019s use to a set schedule and if you keep him on that schedule there rarely is a problem. \n\nI am a licensed RBT and have clients who I work with weekly sometimes daily depending on the behavioral or occupational therapies ordered by their specialist. NOW, L has an RBT assigned to him but he doesn\u2019t like her and this is completely normal as he sees her as someone who tells him what to do and how to do it when he just wants to do his own thing. I have clients like that too. It\u2019s like walking into your least favorite teachers class except im walking into your home most of the time haha. Anyways, K recently asked if I would be willing to change my client list to add my nephew since he behaves when he\u2019s with me. I told him no, one because it\u2019s a conflict of interest and my agency would likely never allow it and secondly because i dont want my nephew to see my as that teacher he hates. How i interact with my nephew outside of my RBT role is entirely different from how it would be should I have a list of therapies to work with him. \n\nMy brother was upset to say the least and has called our dad to express that i dont want to take care of my nephew. My parents for the most part have been neutral and understanding of my point, but my sister (36F) has been calling me a AH for not helping our brother and i\u2019m starting to wonder if maybe i am?", "created_utc": 1688074675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mhbwi/aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_autistic_nephew/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that your family doesn't understand professional boundaries is unfortunate.", "NTA\n\nYou're giving your nephew an ally who backs him up and understand him easier than most by not stepping in as your brother asks you to.", "Absolutely NTA. It can be hard already in that role to not take the job and stress home with you. This would make it even more difficult because of it being a family member whom I assume you're around quite regularly. You're not obligated to mix your personal life with your professional one, and you presented a valid excuse beyond that.", "NTA, have you explained to upur brother the reasons why you can't do it. If you have, he's overreacting. If you haven't, you should because just saying no without explanation does make it sound like you don't want to help.", "NTA. As you said it\u2019s a conflict of interest they should understand that and that should be the end of the matter. Your brother is an AH for not understanding professional boundaries.", "NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s a conflict of interest.  Ask your brother if he can support you if you lose your job.", "NTA. I'm worried they'll say to teach your nephew behind your work's back so that it's not a conflict, oh and do it for free.", "NTA. I was an RBT for 10 years. My company wouldn\u2019t even have allowed that. Conflict of interest majorly.", "NTA. It can coat you your job. I\u2019d asp explain that you would be similar to the other therapists and he may start to not like you", "I understand your brother asked you but he made a mistake, as health professional should not treat family members, unless in an emergency situation of course, that's a absolute No!", "That\u2019s a huge conflict of interest and your brother is just being selfish and weaponizing his son\u2019s disability to try and get what he wants.", "NTA- your work won't allow it.  Clear conflict of interest.", "NTA, its a conflict of interests and the rules are undoubtedly their for a good reason.", "NTA \nDon't mix family and business. It is just like doctors not being allowed to have family members as patients. Your personal and professional lives need to be separate.", "NTA, you need to change the title to not breaking ethical boundaries to provide therapy to my nephew", "NTA \nMedical people should not take on their family as clients and although you're not a doctor, you would absolutely be part of his therapeutic team", "I understand family helping family right? Because that\u2019s how I was brought up and I do help, if any of my siblings need a babysitter or for me to run to the store I\u2019ll do it, but I can\u2019t risk my career for them unfortunately and I would think they\u2019d understand that being career driven people themselves but i digress.", "Thank you! I really do have his best interest in mind, and I can understand my brother\u2019s frustrations with my nephew not liking his RBT but again, it\u2019s just so normal that it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to change if i\u2019m his RBT", "Thank you! I understand that maybe my nephew does behave well with me when he\u2019s in my care but I\u2019m not actively involved in trying to teach him anything beyond maybe manners or things like that which I do with my other nibblings as well. Auntly duties not RBT duties", "Yes! It was what I told him from the very beginning. I just don\u2019t know if maybe he thinks my boss can just overlook familial relations but even if it\u2019s not something I\u2019m willing to risk", "I also suggested other RBTs that work with me who I know are really great if he really wanted to change it up but at the end of the day that\u2019s all i can do", "Exactly. And if the boy doesn't like the dynamic he loses you as his ally instead of potentially growing to like the other RBT.", "NTA, your employer will not approve this.  As you nephew grow older and becomes harder to handle your brother will want you to spend more and more time with him. He is not looking for a RBT he is looking for a free caretaker.", "nta need a break yourself op", "NTA all your reasons are incredibly valid. Your brother is a jerk for going around saying that kind of shit.", "NTA your sister is the AH", "NTA your brother wants you to sacrifice your relationship with your nephew for \"reasons.\" That's not fair to you or your nephew.", "NTA your company won\u2019t let you because all the reasons you have. DR don\u2019t treat family because you can\u2019t be objective.", "Bet the farm they would love you to lose your job, then you can be a full time caregiver for him.", "Clients not liking they\u2019re RBTs is definitely not normal, it means they haven\u2019t paired properly with them and are putting too many demands and not giving enough reinforcement. Have you suggested to your brother that he takes his concerns to the BCBA managing his case? Perhaps they can provide some extra training to the RBT on how to appropriately pair. \nAlso, maybe explain to your brother that it\u2019s not your decision to not take his case, that it\u2019s your supervisors and no BCBA would ever let you work on your nephews case because it\u2019s a dual relationship and you could lose your certification as well as your supervisor facing disciplinary action with the BACB.", "Every time I think im a cynic, I see something like this."]}
