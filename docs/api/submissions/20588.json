It literally helps kids' brains develop so that they have impulse control to resist the shot of dopamine they get from bullying.\n\nYou gave her plenty of chances. The consequence is totally logical and connected to the 'crime'.\n\nWhen parents don't do this, teachers end up spending a lot less time teaching their content and a whole lot more time teaching self-regulation and social norms.

Then he realised I was there and it was a prank.  We talked about how it wasn\u2019t funny being scared like that.  And just like that pranks were put to bed in our house.", "NTA she is purposely torturing her siblings with them. She needs to learn this behavior isn\u2019t ok.", "NTA. She is torturing her siblings. Can you imagine the stress the younger ones are having right now. They don't feel safe at home cuz of this. Hell couldn't even do the sport they enjoy cuz it was in their bag. Talk to your wife and ask her why she is ok with the older one torturing the younger ones?  Like tell her how would she like it if you put something she fears in places in the home that she won't expect it to be? And no matter how much she tells you to stop, you keep doing it. This is a perfect consequence to her behavior. Tell her she is lucky you didn't give the younger ones permission to smash all her dolls and it just in storage", "NTA this is exactly how you\u2019re supposed to set boundaries for your kids. Hopefully she learns that there are consequences to bullying her siblings.", "This is a really good idea. At this point, it's not at all clear whether her \"hobby\" is collecting the dolls, or bullying her siblings with them. It's time to find out. Locking them up in a glass-fronted case where she can see them but not touch them will give you a pretty good idea which she prefers.", "I dunno, but let's just hope they can't get out of a locked storage unit...", "I came here for this", "There's no such thing as \"innocent torment.\" Hurting people on purpose is not innocent.", "But in case he continued with them I assured him that I have some really good ones I could use on him or were we now finished with pranking", "NTA. She turned her toys into weapons to bully her siblings, so they've been removed from her possession until she can prove she will no longer use them to harass the younger siblings. \n\nI think losing doll privileges is perfectly acceptable punishment for repeatedly and meticulously bullying the younger two. I don't know if you had a separate punishment for each time she used the dolls for jumpscares (especially in the shower as that's a big safety hazard for a slip-and-fall, the second child could have tripped/fallen trying to get away and hit their head!) but I think additional consequences for each individual action is appropriate. \n\nUsing the Annabelle film to torment the younger kids while you were out of the house shows she put forethought and planning into making them as uncomfortable as possible while they were home defenseless and that's unacceptable. The well-being and happiness of the other two children far outweigh her desire to have her dolls. (Plus, as a parent or sibling, I'd be so angry having to share space with someone else's clutter like that! The living space is for *the living,* not dolls or any other clutter!!!)\n\nStoring them is the kindest compromise for the moment.", "NTA had it been my father, he'd of smashed the dolls before throwing them out. You don't go around scaring your siblings because you think it's fun.\n\nWrong actions carry severe consequences.", "NTA.  you are being a good father.  i might even say you are a bit late.  plus, she is 14.  what is she crying about dolls for?", "nta", "Chances are for things that are annoying and a kid who tries. \nMore chances for this kid means more terror for younger sibs, and that is completely unacceptable.", "I'm an only child even I know all about the allure of tormenting younger family members. For me instead of siblings it was cousins. I was obviously not taught this. My mother certainly never encouraged it once it started happening. Tormenting and teasing is just human nature and it's jerks and bullies who take it to the extreme.", "You know what's also part of a childhood? Being punished for things you were told not to do. So in your own words: It's good for the 14 year old, she'll develop some resilience, she can manage without the dolls for a while.", "NTA.  Her love of the dolls is not more important than the mental wellbeing of her siblings.  When she stops weaponizing the dolls, you can reintroduce them slowly, one at a time.  But make clear that if she pulls the same stunts again, the dolls go in storage until she moves out of your house.  She\u2019s too old not to understand what she\u2019s doing, which means she knows it\u2019s wrong and is choosing to do it anyway.  Do not reward that behavior.", "If it\u2019s not in her room it goes in the bin. Shouldn\u2019t take long for her to catch on", "NTA - she\u2019s lucky her siblings haven\u2019t already smashed  and thrown away every single one of those dolls. It\u2019s what I  would do if someone was trying to terrorise me. Bully\u2019s need to be taught it is not ok to bully and that's definitely what is going on here.", "Yta.. if you can't torment your siblings, who can you torment.", "NTA you gave her chance after chance but she continued to torment her siblings", "It's bullying and traumatizing the siblings so NTA op", "OP should tell their partner. \n\"Either the dolls are in a unit until she learns to not bully her siblings. Or you can find the money we will need to spend on therapy for the two others because she ends up traumatising them, if she hasn't already\"", "I hate that type of doll. I find them very scary, if that happened to me I would have been having nightmares. FYI I am a woman of nearly seventy.", "Yeah, no joke this is clearly funny and a game to the child! She\u2019s not learning anything until they are gone.", "This is true."]}
