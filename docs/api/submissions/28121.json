They usually get along really well and rarely fight.\n\nFor context my son also wears glasses as he is severely visually impaired and is almost blind without them.\n\nAs the children were playing yesterday I noticed Jeremiah and Lucas getting into a fight over a small truck. Lucas had it in his hand (keep in mind, this truck was Lucas\u2019 that he brought from our home) so I asked him if he could give it to Jeremiah for a bit. Lucas looked at me however was hesitant and said no. At this moment, Jeremiah pushed his hand into Lucas\u2019 face shoving him to the ground, then ripped his glasses off causing them to crack. I watched in shock. My sister came over a couple minutes later and asked me what had happened, so I explained it to her. To my surprise she didn\u2019t ask Jeremiah to apologise or say anything really, despite Lucas being in tears. \n\nAbout 5 minutes later I asked my sister why she didn\u2019t do anything back there, which she responded that her son can work these things out himself and she shouldn\u2019t have to get get involved. I got quite angry at her, and she responded saying \u201cwell maybe your kid needs to toughen up and stop being so fragile\u201d so I told her he also broke my sons glasses to which she then replied  \u201cit\u2019s not my fault your kid is blind and not my fault he didn\u2019t share his toy\u201d I told her she needs to parent her kid better by asking him to be less aggressive and rude and we left, leaving me to pay for a new set of glasses. \nI feel terrible about what I said, so AITA?\n\nEdit: thank you for all the responses. Some people are saying to take my sister to court so she can pay for the glasses. Is this taking it too far? I wanted to try and keep a healthy relationship with my sister and therefore my family but this has really changed my view on her. Another thing to add, I would have been completely fine if Lucas wanted to keep his truck, I would have suggested that Jeremiah find another toy. I\u2019m not a soft or fragile parent, or person for that matter and don\u2019t let people walk over me. However I do understand that in this situation I probably let my sister do that and should have handled the situation differently.", "created_utc": 1696325062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yn3rm/aita_for_telling_my_sister_how_to_parent_her_child/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were right to call her on it, and it's crazy that she's not teaching her child to apologize or paying for your son's glasses.\n\nHer ridiculous comment that it's not her fault your kid wears glasses was incredibly stupid and even cruel. So, if your kid needed a wheelchair, it would be fine to break it? It's fine to destroy clothes, because it's not her fault you want to wear them?

During the years I was parenting young children, it would have been considered impolite to correct others' children.\n\nExample: My SIL and I had very different parenting philosophies, and I knew she'd be offended if I corrected my nephews.  But, whatever I thought of her methods, I knew she was actively parenting them.\n\nNow, I am old and crotchety and see far too many parents not bothering to parent their brats.  If their kid's behavior hurt or inconvenienced me or mine, that kid would hear about it.  No physical intervention unless they were actively attacking someone.  No verbal personal attacks that are unrelated to the behavior.  \n\nWell, I'd try very hard on that last.  But at a certain age, say middle school, I believe kids should have a basic sense of the decent behavior expected in a civil society. Sometimes, their youthful impetuousness will get the better of them.  But certain behaviors - like assaulting those weaker, younger, & smaller than themselves for toys - would elicit my colorful side and, possibly, the involvement of authorities.\n\nImagine if OP's nephew assaulted a blind kid at school and broke his glasses.  Would it be even remotely okay?\n\nI think a child should learn what behaviors others might find wrong, shameful, mean, selfish, etc.  And if calling them a worthless shit who is a source of shame to his entire family would hit home for the little AH, so be it.  Some behaviors are shameful, and being the sort of person who engages in them should be a source of shame.  Don't want to be called a mean, self-centered, worthless, little shit?  Don't act like one.\n\nAnd if getting a kid suspended or inconveniencing his (or her!) absent parents with a trip to the principals office gets them thinking about how inconvenient it can be to not bother raising one's child, so be it.", "Looking back, I should have asked him to apologise but felt it wasn\u2019t my place, normally I wouldn\u2019t discipline other people\u2019s children, but now that I\u2019ve had some time Im realising it was definitely the right thing to do.
