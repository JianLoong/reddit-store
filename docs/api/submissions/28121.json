They usually get along really well and rarely fight.\n\nFor context my son also wears glasses as he is severely visually impaired and is almost blind without them.\n\nAs the children were playing yesterday I noticed Jeremiah and Lucas getting into a fight over a small truck. Lucas had it in his hand (keep in mind, this truck was Lucas\u2019 that he brought from our home) so I asked him if he could give it to Jeremiah for a bit. Lucas looked at me however was hesitant and said no. At this moment, Jeremiah pushed his hand into Lucas\u2019 face shoving him to the ground, then ripped his glasses off causing them to crack. I watched in shock. My sister came over a couple minutes later and asked me what had happened, so I explained it to her. To my surprise she didn\u2019t ask Jeremiah to apologise or say anything really, despite Lucas being in tears. \n\nAbout 5 minutes later I asked my sister why she didn\u2019t do anything back there, which she responded that her son can work these things out himself and she shouldn\u2019t have to get get involved. I got quite angry at her, and she responded saying \u201cwell maybe your kid needs to toughen up and stop being so fragile\u201d so I told her he also broke my sons glasses to which she then replied  \u201cit\u2019s not my fault your kid is blind and not my fault he didn\u2019t share his toy\u201d I told her she needs to parent her kid better by asking him to be less aggressive and rude and we left, leaving me to pay for a new set of glasses. \nI feel terrible about what I said, so AITA?\n\nEdit: thank you for all the responses. Some people are saying to take my sister to court so she can pay for the glasses. Is this taking it too far? I wanted to try and keep a healthy relationship with my sister and therefore my family but this has really changed my view on her. Another thing to add, I would have been completely fine if Lucas wanted to keep his truck, I would have suggested that Jeremiah find another toy.", "created_utc": 1696325062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yn3rm/aita_for_telling_my_sister_how_to_parent_her_child/", "score": 881, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were right to call her on it, and it's crazy that she's not teaching her child to apologize or paying for your son's glasses.\n\nHer ridiculous comment that it's not her fault your kid wears glasses was incredibly stupid and even cruel. So, if your kid needed a wheelchair, it would be fine to break it? It's fine to destroy clothes, because it's not her fault you want to wear them? The lack of logic in her statements is almost as astounding as the lack of basic decency.\n\nYou should review why you've \"always gotten along great\"; do you let her (and her son) walk all over you (and your son)?\n\nFinally, this is your nephew.

During the years I was parenting young children, it would have been considered impolite to correct others' children.\n\nExample: My SIL and I had very different parenting philosophies, and I knew she'd be offended if I corrected my nephews.  But, whatever I thought of her methods, I knew she was actively parenting them.\n\nNow, I am old and crotchety and see far too many parents not bothering to parent their brats.  If their kid's behavior hurt or inconvenienced me or mine, that kid would hear about it.  No physical intervention unless they were actively attacking someone.  No verbal personal attacks that are unrelated to the behavior.  \n\nWell, I'd try very hard on that last.  But at a certain age, say middle school, I believe kids should have a basic sense of the decent behavior expected in a civil society. Sometimes, their youthful impetuousness will get the better of them.  But certain behaviors - like assaulting those weaker, younger, & smaller than themselves for toys - would elicit my colorful side and, possibly, the involvement of authorities.\n\nImagine if OP's nephew assaulted a blind kid at school and broke his glasses.  Would it be even remotely okay?\n\nI think a child should learn what behaviors others might find wrong, shameful, mean, selfish, etc.  And if calling them a worthless shit who is a source of shame to his entire family would hit home for the little AH, so be it.  Some behaviors are shameful, and being the sort of person who engages in them should be a source of shame.  Don't want to be called a mean, self-centered, worthless, little shit?  Don't act like one.\n\nAnd if getting a kid suspended or inconveniencing his (or her!) absent parents with a trip to the principals office gets them thinking about how inconvenient it can be to not bother raising one's child, so be it.", "Looking back, I should have asked him to apologise but felt it wasn\u2019t my place, normally I wouldn\u2019t discipline other people\u2019s children, but now that I\u2019ve had some time Im realising it was definitely the right thing to do.

Kids share play things in most environments so it\u2019s expected that this will be shared too. It\u2019s absolutely unacceptable that was met with violence and it was unacceptable that the 8 year old wasn\u2019t told that not sharing certain special toys is ok", "Unless OP wants the throw away her relationship with her sister, going to court is excessive. But she can still send the bill and ask for it to be paid. When sister refuses, I would stop any gift giving and instead give just a card with a note that in lieu of gift she is putting $50 (or whatever amount she would have used towards a gift) towards the replacement of the glasses her son broke. Do this for all gifts for their family. NTA", "\\^This - what sort of aunt mocks a kid for being vision impaired?", "Trust me I am livid about her behaviour. I plan to go limited contact until she pays for the glasses and apologises. If not, no contact it is. Thank you for your input.", "Anyone writing a comment like this to a good mom asking for some guidance is a disgrace.", "I get that hosting a large gathering is stressful, and I would give sister some leeway if she had SAID \"I can't deal with this right now, we'll talk later\", but the thing that really kicked it over the line for me is her saying that the 5 year old needs to 'toughen up and stop being so fragile.' That is not a stressed out hostess. That's just a wicked awful person that happens to be hosting that day.", "It helps if you read more than the title", "Mind her own business \ud83d\ude02 this directly involves her 5 year old son, he is her business", "[removed]", "I was that older sibling when my little brother was two and a half he was playing with one of those bubble lawn mowers in our front yard and our next door neighbor who was a 13-year-old boy (I was like almost 11 at the time) this boy was huge he was like 6 ft tall almost at 13 and every bit of 200 lbs ( i was 5 ft 6 125 lbs) my little brother was pushing his bubble lawn mower and some of the bubbles spilled on that boy's bike why his bike was in our front yard is beyond me.. so that boy snatches the bubble mower out of my two and a half year old brother's hands throws it at my baby brother and hits him with it. Man the adrenaline was pumping  so I yelled at him and told him everything that was on my mind I can't really say it on so he comes up and shoves me to the ground I got up and I whooped that 13 year olds butt. My big brother was an MMA fighter and he taught me a lot of self-defense moves we would spar together quite often. After I whooped that 13 year old bullies butt his parents called the cops on me! When the cops arrived my dad and my mom and quite a few neighbors that seen it, told the cops what really happened. Needless to say they laughed at that boy and his mom and he was the one who got in trouble because I was defending myself and my brother. Op your sister is a bully and so is her son I wouldn't take my son around them anymore. NTA at all", "It\u2019s frequently how it plays out in schools though where things are assumed to be shared and kids are punished for not sharing. I agree, it\u2019s weird but this 8 year old probably doesn\u2019t have much guidance in navigating this", "What's done is done. The only question now is, how much do you want to maintain a relationship with your sister?  Your answer to that question will determine whether you distance yourself from her or try to make amends.  But it looks like you're going to have to give her a pass on this one if you want to keep things good between you.", "What I can't understand is how you expect to have a \"healthy relationship\" with your sister when she treats you and your son like this.  She's not going to change those stripes.  She's entitled and abusive, and the best relationship you can ever hope to have will be one of abuse and exploitation while you walk on eggshells trying to keep the peace.  Leave it alone.  Don't talk to her, don't help her, don't babysit for her, don't bail her out in emergencies, and don't stroke her ego when her badly-behaved little boy ends up friendless and excluded by other children.  She's going to have much bigger problems, and what happened here is just a warning sign of what's to come.  Let her work that out on her own, since she's such a fabulous parent (/s).  NTA, but Y.T.A. if you bury your head in the sand in the name of fostering a \"healthy relationship\"", "Pressing charges is overboard with family. Give her a chance to apologize. If she doesn't have a talk with her and tell her the kids can't play together until she addresses the bullying.", "But if you were in the middle of a karaoke song, and someone took the mic from you, i doubt you\u2019d be all sure. I was done with that.", "Your son needs to know you have his back when he is being bullied. And he was, both by his cousin and by your sister.", "Honestly, your nephew might grow to appreciate a family member bothering to teach him decent behavior.  Eventually, most kids figure out you expect better of them because you care about them.\n\nAnyway, you're definitely NTA here.  Your sister is.", "Wow. Thank you for bringing this up. I didn\u2019t even think about what would happen if Jeremiah is doing this to children in his school and how they will be feeling. This makes me livid.", "Not really on topic, but Zenni (and probably a lot of other online retailers) have great ones! So much cheaper. You enter your prescription and they mail them in a couple of weeks. Not being able to try them on is annoying, but if you don\u2019t like them, you can probably re-order several pairs before hitting that amount.", "Incredibly expensive and necessary for life, I think people who don't need glasses could cry due to empathy. Unlimited money doesn't even get you new glasses in five minutes", "I would look into an online alternative. My sister called me crying two years ago because my nephew needed special lenses and he has bad eyesight and they were saying his lenses themselves were gonna be $600. I went on zenni.com and got him two pairs of glasses with the special lenses he needed for 160 bucks and then got rush delivery and then ship them to Spain where my sister was living.  I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any would be an option for you, but there must be some alternative.\n\nEta: she was on a military base and the medical doesn\u2019t cover glasses.", "I did too", "See I would like to get some sort of compensation (not even about the money more just the principal) but I feel that is going a bit far for an 8 year old? I\u2019m much more angry at my sister than her son.", "No, but if they moved onto song 2,3,4 with no explanation then it would be very annoying. The kids aren\u2019t at fault here but sharing is the socially acceptable norm for kids. Violence isn\u2019t as unusual as adults like to think it is either. All still need a conversation though, lots of folks are in the wrong here", "Yeah. In the moment I thought leaving would be the best thing to do but I should have said something to Jeremiah rather than waited and spoken to my sister. I plan to talk with my son tomorrow to let him know it wasn\u2019t his fault and I have his back.", ">You clearly have poor communication skills just like OP.\n\nPot, meet kettle.", "The only question now is, how much do you want to maintain a relationship with your sister?

But it looks like you're going to have to give her a pass on this one if you want to keep things good between you.", "[removed]", "Most of the money is the lenses and not the frame itself. With an diopter, night blindness and astigmatism the glasses itself are almost 200 per glass. I have looked online, but no one took my prescription back then. Maybe they would now? But I love my optometrist tbh. Thankfully since the glasses were still good he was able to find a new frame that a friend/collegue still had lying around (frame went out of season, wasn't sold anymore). So I only paid for that new frame and not new glasses", "500 euros is probably not a basic Rx, and Zenni and other online retailers are really only suitable for people with \"easy\" prescriptions. Once you get into stronger prescriptions (about +/-2), astigmatism, or a moderate difference between the eyes, it's a lot more important to have the center of the lens lined up with where the pupil sits vertically. Frames with nosepads can at least be adjusted to a degree to account for that, but most people aren't perfectly symmetrical and will vary by a few mm's, and plastic frames are even more difficult to correct for poor optical center placement. \n\nGoing to a private clinic is usually the best bet for anyone who isn't super low maintenance, because they will actually measure that out with the frames of your choice sitting on your face.", "I can't get my glasses from Zenni, they don't make my prescription.  I used to, years back, and I agree they're great, but I've gotten too blind, unfortunately, so I have to go to an actual optometrist that makes their own lenses in-house.", "I love zenni they're great gunna buy sunglasses soon I think", "Your sister is 100% responsible for those glasses.  It is extreme to take her to small claims court and the fall-out might be a lot, but she completely deserves it.  How could she say that about your son?  That is the thing that would be a deal breaker for me.", "Sorry if it wasn\u2019t clear, you\u2019re absolutely right that he needs to be parented properly before he becomes an adult that thinks that the behavior he just showed is ok. So, yes, you should be more annoyed / angry at your sister rather than the kid.\n\nAlso, the parents are responsible for the destroyed glasses.", "An 8 year old is definitely more than old enough to know that hitting someone in the face or pushing them is unacceptable. Even a 5 year old understands this idea. Not to mention the issue of picking on a kid half his age which make it even more egregious. She\u2019s the parent and definitely should bear the full responsibility to replace the frames or if that\u2019s not possible, to pay for a new pair. I would not hesitate to bring her to small claims if she doesn\u2019t agree to pay willingly. Like you say, it\u2019s the principle of it in addition to the actual expense", "You need to set your sister straight. Jeremiah is a kid. His mother is an adult who made an ableist comment about your son. She should know better.", "You need to tell your sister that you are going LC until her son apologizes to your son and she pays for the glasses. Also calling him \"blind\" is not OK. She is an adult and should behave like one.\n\nDon't expose your kid to these relatives until they shape up.", "Very true. But, you can't allow your son to be around a kid who is aggressive and no one says anything about it. \n\nThis behavior does not happen around me, period. Hands and mouths are kept to yourself. I correct it, because that is what adults do.\n\nI correct it, then engage the appropriate adult(s). Letting them know that what their kid did is not okay and they need to understand I made the correction. Then, we can handle the next part as adults. Most kids want direction and correction. It's the adults who really need the attitude adjustment.\n\nHer sister needs a good talking to, then a little bit of what her son gave out, so she can understand that it is not cool.", "I think you might have replied to the wrong person, I didn't say anything about pressing charges.", "I\u2019m really lucky that my prescription is simple. Online is definitely not a good option for a lot of people. When I first got glasses though, I spent $500 for my simple prescription because that\u2019s what they had at my optometrist\u2019s office. That was very overpriced in my case and I mostly paid for the frames. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me to even shop around online.", "Yep. My glasses cost $450/pair because i need them to be both shatter and scratch resistant for my job as well as an unusual prescription. I get $5 frames. Also not covered under insurance, they basically told me if I want it covered to get a job that lets me wear cheap ones.", "I broke my glasses right as I lost my health insurance. I have a -9.00 diopter with a -1.25 astigmatism and a 175\u00b0 axis in my left eye, and a -8.50 diopter with a -0.75 astigmatism and a 25\u00b0 astigmatism in my right eye.

He needs some sort of consequences for what he did.", "It's a bot with a stolen comment.", "My mom's was $435, frame $35, $400 just for lenses; no transitions and you can see the bi-focal lines.", "Hey if it works out for you, that's awesome! I just know from experience in the industry that it very often doesn't", "You are going great!  Your instincts are right on!", "Thank you", "Thank you. I appreciate it."]}
