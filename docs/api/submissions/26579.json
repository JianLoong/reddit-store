I really don't think anyone in the scenario was being malicious at least.  \n\n\nHowever, it's well known in the guitar world that if it is wall mounted, it's mounted for a reason.

She should have been apologetic, not hostile and self-righteous.\n\nNTA. Don't let her come over again.", "NTA.\n\nHe should have asked before touching something of yours.\n\nYour sister is wrong for giving you grief for it, but I wouldn't write her bf off as a bad person.

If it's mounted on a wall though... no", "Eh, I would still generally ask before picking up someone\u2019s personal musical instrument or playing on their piano. Using other\u2019s personal possessions without permission or asking is generally considered quite rude here. I own an instrument and I definitely wouldn\u2019t want people randomly playing on it.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. You always ask first before touching someone\u2019s property.

Op's reaction is legit either way.", "Guitar wall hangers are just stands without a bottom.  \u201cMounted\u201d is a weasely way to pretend like it\u2019s on display and not sitting in a stand in a very public area.", "Yeah, I agree, he might just have been unfamiliar with that social custom, and seen a cool thing to play. Some people don't understand what value instruments hold to their players.", "I honestly think you\u2019re NTA. I own a piano myself and I wouldn\u2019t wouldn\u2019t want people randomly banging on it. I worked overtime to specifically save the $2,000 it cost and is one of the first really nice things I\u2019ve ever bought myself. \n\nI also personally feel snooping through or using other people\u2019s things without asking is rude af.", "I think neither of you were really in the wrong here, he thought he was just messing around with an instrument, and you saw him playing an instrument that was very sentimental\n to you and got upset. Neither of you are in the wrong, but maybe you should clarify that it was something very special to you, as this seems like it might have been prevented if he knew about that.", "My own home where I live alone is not exactly a public area", "That is true. People see something bright and shiny, think, \u201cHey, cool!\u201d and begin striking or plunking away, completely overlooking the fact it actually belongs to someone.\n\nIt holds a lot of value for me because I had always wanted to take piano lessons and I put in a lot of the overtime to buy a nice digital one as I have small place and I didn\u2019t want to drive my landlord crazy by not having a headphone option (heard too many stories of musicians during lockdown having to practice and their neighbours being driven crazy). I lived next door to a drummer once in an attached house and I will just say it came with a pretty high auditory price as the kid had taken no lessons and had no idea of how to actually play them.", "So you think it is fine to walk into the home of someone you don't know, with whom you have a mutual friend, and just take an instrument off the wall and mess with it? This isn't like picking up a magazine off a coffee table and leafing through it. It doesn't matter that the OP has a sentimental feeling for the guitar, altho that adds to her distress. Dude is way of of line. NTA.", "No, he was definitely in the wrong.", "He\u2019s 22, not 5. He should have more impulse control than \u201cooh shiny!\u201d", "Yep, I remember a few years ago, I think I was like 11/12, I had chimes, and all my friends wanted to just...play them really harshly, and I was trying to find a way to politely tell them to STOP NEARLY BREAKING MY CHIMES.", "This exactly. Someone banging on the keys so hard damage happens would be my biggest fear."]}
