Your husband did fine because he presumably went to college here in the US, or worked right after high school. Getting into college here is not the same as it is in Germany- I think your husband is being either cheap, selfish, or purposefully obtuse by not prioritizing/ seeing that German public school are not the same as American public schools.

There are some great public schools in the US but it varies so much, and regardless they will most likely not have the resources or experience to prepare your daughter for college in Germany, even if the curriculum is good, the counselors there will likely not have any knowledge as to what tests she needs to take and what the application process is like. I applied for some schools in the UK and got no help at all and it was very difficult. Especially if she wants to return to Germany for university, it\u2019s best not to interrupt her life as much as you can.", "Please keep in mind that a High School Diploma is not considered as 'Allgemeine Hochschulreife', so the vast majority of German Universities will not even consider her eligible with that, no matter how good her grades are. An IB should work, and there might be some off chances that some Universities will accept her with all AP courses in the core subjects + those subjects related to what she wants to do (this happened occasionally in past years, but is nothing you can count on since this is up to the University to decide), but generally, a German University will not accept someone whose highest degree is a US High School Diploma, because it is not seen as equal to the Abitur (and frankly, it's just not, you don't even have to take Math all the way until you finish High School and definitely don't have to meet the requirements of having taken two foreign languages). So if she goes to a Public School in the US, she will very, very likely not be able to go to a German University. \n\nDefinitely NTA\n\nWould a boarding school in Germany be an option (there are some that are sponsored by the federal states that might be not quite as expensive as private ones)?", "**NTA**\n\nThis post may get taken down as debate bait unfortunately, because people are going to have and share a LOT of opinions about U.S. public vs private schools. But the reality is that none of that is relevant to the question at hand. \n\nWhat IS relevant is that IN THIS INSTANCE you are approaching this from a purely pragmatic viewpoint. You've looked at what your daughter has already studied and would be studying in the next couple of years if you stayed in Germany; you've looked at the curriculum in the public schools where you're moving to in California; and you've determined that there is a very specific logistical problem wherein your daughter would not be receiving an appropriately challenging education or really any education at all, because from a purely practical point of view, she'd be retaking courses she has already done, and would not be afforded the opportunity to study the things that would move her forward academically before university, and she's at an age where that matters very much. Whereas if you put her in an international school or an International Baccalaureate program at a private school, for example, she could continue to advance in her studies appropriately. This isn't about classism or elitism, it's about letting her advance academically at a steady rate. \n\nAs others have noted, it's POSSIBLE that this could be done at a charter or magnet school within the public system, but those don't always have open enrollment, and again, the curricula, while better than standard public schools, are still not the same as an IB program and might not be what she needs as an international student. \n\nYour husband, on the other hand, is reacting to your rationally expressed concerns with purely emotional outrage based on what seems to be an insecurity that you are suggesting that his own public education was lacking. This is neither true nor remotely relevant. Your husband wasn't a German transfer student who had spent most of his academic career in another country, and was likely to go back. The situations are apples and oranges. He is trying to hamstring your daughter based on his own personal affront over something you have neither said nor implied.

You're leaping to conclusions about what is available via a public education.\n\nMost public-school systems have flexibility to place students in accelerated coursework. For example a single high school will offer Algebra, Geometry, Algebra II + Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Statistics, Calculus, & Calculus II, and place students in the class that offers continued learning. The school doesn't want to waste their time reteaching subjects to your daughter.\n\nUnless you have been in touch with the school and the principal to get an understanding of what they can actually offer her, you are being closedminded and elitist. \n\nYour husband sucks too. No, it isn't as simple as \"public schools are fine, she'll be fine.\" California public schools CAN be problematic, though many are fantastic. It's also bigoted to have the attitude that he won't send his daughter to school with \"rich kids.\"\n\nYou two need to get a grip and work on this for your daughter instead of fighting about it.", "ESH - You both need to calm the hell down. First you are both wrong. There are International Baccalaureate programs and accelerated programs at public schools that can far exceed most private schools curriculum. That being said, there are some public school systems that are garbage. You are both so suck in your own heads you aren't taking the time to hear what the other person is saying. Lots of kids get great educations from the public system. Some don't. Look into where you are going to move and do your research. Stop saying the other person is wrong and come up with a system that works for your daughter and not just to prove you are right.", "Probably going to get downvoted for this, but I'm going to say soft ESH because you're both talking about keeping your kid to get what you want. Nobody gets to kidnap the kid and alienate them from their other parent because their parents can't come to an agreement on how to educate their child. You're the adults, figure it out.  \n\n\nYou're not wrong for wanting your child to progress in her education, but you're wrong to be making a unilateral decision about your child's education. You both get a say here.  \n\n\nYour husband also sucks for not hearing your perspective and taking a \"it was good enough for me\" approach. U.S. public schools have changed since your husband was a kid, and generally not for the better.   \n\n\nYou make a good point about how your daughter needs to remain competitive if she's going to university in Germany. If your husband wants to send your child to a public school, then you're both going to have do do your homework to find one that is going to be at an appropriate level for your child: look for magnet schools and IB schools and schools that offer advanced coursework. Don't default to whatever is the zoned school where your home is located. I agree with you that it's important not to backslide. Get your child's transcripts translated into English and actually talk with school administrators about how to keep her education on track.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd your husband also needs to be open to the possibility that a private school may be necessary if there aren't enough public school choices that will meet her needs. It can't just be \"it was  good enough for me\" or \"I don't want to pay for a private education.\" Put your child's education first. Keeping her options open for German higher education would also offset the cost of going to university in the U.S., where the pricetag is a lot steeper.\n\nAlso, try to have some empathy that he's in a stressful place and is looking at uprooting your whole family to be a caregiver for his father.", "ESH. Both of you need to actually sit down and TALK. Not argue. Also unless you're moving to some podunk town in Cali there are likely SEVERAL high schools where you will be moving too meaning as others have said there are options like IB & other magnet programs as well as AP classes. Jumping straight to international schools is as they say jumping the gun because you haven't even looked at all the options.", "NAH -- but there may be a compromise. Look around where you'll be moving and see if there are magnet schools in the area. These are public schools that offer either a more focused curriculum (my son goes to one specializing in STEM) or are just more challenging. Look for one that offers an International Baccalaureate diploma, which is an academically rigorous programmed that was originally designed for the children of American diplomats who were studying abroad. Also she can take Advanced Placement courses, which are more strenuous and count towards college credit (at least in the US; I have no idea if they transfer internationally).", "NTA - your husband needs to stop taking this personally re: his own education background and do what\u2019s best for his kid.", "NTA. Your daughter deserves to continue schooling at the level that she's at. If the public school's curriculum would leave her repeating coursework she's already mastered, it's not in her best interests to attend that school.\n\nThere are two other ways of solving this without private schooling, though an international school is very likely going to be the easiest curriculum for her to adjust to. First, call the school. Ask them what they can do to accommodate a student that far above grade level. Can Lena be enrolled in higher levels than what would be expected for her age? Does the school offer Advanced Placement courses, which are designed to be taught at roughly the same level as the first two years of university courses? (They can also count for college credit in the US.) If so, how can Lena enroll in them? Can she graduate early if she takes the top level courses and passes?  Can she dual enroll in a local college or university? It's imperative to talk to the public school earlier rather than after the move so that if Lena does attend the public school she's got the best possible transition and doesn't waste a semester or a full year because the school wasn't prepared.\n\nWe also have an alternative to a high school diploma called a General Education Degree (GED). It might be worth seeing what it would take for Lena to get that in the first few months she's in the US and skip highschool altogether. She can take the GED exam and go straight to college, either a two-year community college, junior college or even straight into the local university. Then when she's old enough to go back to Germany she can transfer to a German university and already have some credits. This could be just as expensive as a private school, and I'd research how US university credits transfer to German universities before starting this. But it would keep her from stalling out her education for two years.", "ESH - I am sorry you both seem annoying.  You think sending your kid to a public school is going to ruin her future?  This seems like a complete overreaction and probably made your husband mad by implying that his education was worthless.\n\nAt the same time I understand that you want to make sure your daughter feels comfortable and you are worried about moving to a new country and the impact that will have.  Your husband needs to understand and not discount your concerns.\n\nYou two need to figure this crap out soon and act like adults.  Your child is the one that is going to have the hardest of times moving and you two not talking to each other and refusing to discuss alternative options.  Do you have to go to that 1 public school or can you move to a location with options that are better suited for your daughter?  Have you talked to the school administration about your concerns and her current level of schooling?  Maybe they know of options that would suit your daughter.", "NAH.\n\nYou both have valid points - and advocating for Lena is certainly not an AH thing to do. \n\nOn the other hand, this attitude of \"Public schools aren't good enough for MY kid\" is precisely how public schools became not good enough for anyone's kid, and while it's certainly not your responsibility to correct that (you're not even American and don't have a vote in our self-sabotaged system) you're playing into the same narrative that is sabotaging our kids, and your husband is not an AH for not buying into that.\n\nUltimately I think some compromise is needed - whether that be an IB school, having Lena skip some grades so that she's taking appropriate classes, staying behind so Lena can finish her schooling - whatever makes it work. Neither of you are wrong, but both of you need to be focused on what is best for Lena (and to your credit, I believe you are). I think your husband is taking too broad a view and not looking at the specifics of your situation.", "NTA. Your spouse is uprooting the family in order to move closer to his father.  It is great that he wants to give his father support but it is unfair of him to not consider the needs of his daughter and jeopardize her goal to attend university in Germany.  You have offered a fair compromise to have her attend a private school that you are even willing to pay for on your own. His reasons for rejecting it are shallow.  It's not about him anyway.  He won't be  the one attending the school or the one jeopardizing his university admission.", "NAH but your husband kinda has a point? In the US the income inequality is just bad, and if you send your child to private school sure maybe the curriculum *might* be better (smaller schools generally have less options for classes and class levels) the social aspect of dealing with only very very privileged kids might be... a problem to put it lightly. \n\nIn the US we also have this thing called a charter school. They're public schools that usually offer a different type of curriculum. Many charter schools focus on math and science etc. They're still public schools so you see kids from all walks of life but they may also offer more of a challenge for your daughter.\n\nGood luck OP!", "ESH, but mostly your husband. If you have the means to send your child to a better school I really don't understand why he would be against it. Based on this post it does kinda sound like you are insinuating that she'll wind up a complete and total idiot if she goes to \"normal\" school and that does seem stuck up and, frankly, isn't true. I also feel like you should know that regardless of how \"good\" of a school you send your daughter too here, it is going to be different and probably behind. Our education system sucks here. That being said, I think you need to calm down and RESPECTFULLY talk to him about your concerns and see what the real hang up is. Maybe also remember that his father is incredibly ill and he is planning an international move and he's probably very stressed out just like you are. You threatening to stay behind with his daughter instead of taking a moment to chill is why I say ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The focus of the international schools my kids went to was offering a known consistent curriculum that is readily transferable and understood by universities around the world. Most of the students were the children of expat employees of international firms and foreign bureaucrats... the parents definitely were professional class, but there weren't private drivers at school pickups or maseratis at parent teacher nights. \nMy kids also found it much easier to break social circles and make friends while at international schools due to the transient nature of the student body... they've really struggled now that we have them in 'regular' schools in our home country, where most of their high school classmates have been together since elementary school.", "sure! charter schools exist primarily to take money out of the public school system and funnel it to private corporations (who conveniently also lobby for further promotion of charter schools). very, very, **very** rarely are they even competitive with the public schools they claim to replace, especially when you consider that charters are legally allowed to reject any student they think might affect the school\u2019s overall average (ie kids with learning disabilities) while public schools are not. it frequently gets worse, but at a minimum it\u2019s a fraud perpetrated on an unwitting public", "People should pay for the schools I want them to, not the ones they use.", "We saw that in CA, if you look a little under the surface the charters aren't offering anything more than the neighborhood school, except classmates with slightly wealthier parents.", "I actually know someone who grew up entirely in the American public school system in the 2000s (graduated in 2017) and attended university in Germany for free and did very well.

Be adults and actually have a reasonable conversation with each other. You're both being stubborn and obtuse AF. You need to open your mind to public schools to at least have a conversation--a fair one--with your husband. He needs to look more into this private school you've found, again, with an open mind. His concerns are valid, but if, for example, we're talking about a German International School specifically, I don't think it will be full of the kind of \"rich kids\" he has in mind? A very specific kind of student goes to that sort of school, including lots of children of ex-pats, so she'd fit right in. But you went and threw an insane ultimatum so now his hackles are all the way up.\n\nAnd INFO: where in California? Because I'm trying to think where on earth you could have both an international private school AND the public school could possibly be that bad? Because typically the parts of Cali with the former are, uh, rich AF and have pretty good schools (b/c this country is a classist hellscape). It makes me wonder if you're being overly judgmental about this public school and/or don't fully understand the full range of educational options in the U.S. As others have mentioned, many public schools have IB programs that would be a good fit/compromise, and even AP in a half decent school system isn't garbage. The U.S. public school system has a LOT of problems, and indeed our systems are very different, but you're basically saying to your husband that anyone who goes to an American public school--including him--is inherently inferior to a German, ie: you. Like, jeeze, lady. I participated in a whole ass government sponsored exchange program to help dispel highfalutin, snobbish ideas like that (I was a PPP student).\n\nBut also: Lena is 15. While in Germany it's normal to decide your entire life path at a young age b/c you literally have to choose your education path, she's \\*young\\*. She's never lived in the U.S. or tried a different system/experience. How do you know she won't fall in love with American high school culture, and develop an interest in our VERY different university experiences, as well? I was a high school foreign exchange student (to Germany) and also worked for an organization in the U.S. 80% of our students coming here--2K+ a year--were German. They were OBSESSED with the dream of a \"typical\" American high school experience... and most of them would have made a goat sacrifice to go to California! Your daughter will be getting a dream experience... Why not broaden her horizons and world view and frame this move as something different and constructive? Don't freak her out with all this fear-mongering and fighting between you and her dad. Why not open her up to both options? She could spend the next four years in an American high school and decide she wants to go to Stanford, for all you know... or hold fast to the Germany University plan, which would require a few extra hoops, but wouldn't be out of the question? I don't know... why be so rigid? The move is happening, why not make the best of it?\n\nBut also also your husband doesn't speak German?! He's lived there 15+ years! He married you! Your daughter is German! Look I know Americans do this, but I just have to take a moment to cry a little. (my German may be rusty AF but when I lived there, I only spoke German, dammit! I was NOT going to be That American...) So you have my sympathies there at least...", "NTA. Why can't she go to a junior college or a local college in America if she's so advanced?

I was a very average student in Europe...slept thru HS and graduated in the top 10 of my class. Went to one of the top public universities in the country for free because i did great compared to my inner city classmates. In college I was amazed at how much more advanced my international classmates were. In the end I'm still doing very well career wise (im the US).

Obviously an international school will offer IB or French Baccalaureate, but I went to a public high school IB program (in Wichita, Kansas) and went to college (in Montreal) with a lot of kids who did IB in other countries or French bac and we all were all equally well prepared for college. \n\nPublic school is very hit or miss in the US, so OP isn\u2019t an AH for wanting her kid to have a good quality education.

While the public elementary school isn\u2019t terrible, my daughter is way ahead of her peers in the neighborhood that attend the public school. I know of several families that removed their children from our charter school because they felt the curriculum and the pace was too strenuous. In the first grade she has homework, spelling tests, they use Singapore math, the history and science teacher is a literal PhD, and she is learning Latin and Spanish. Maybe we just lucked out with a great Charter School, but I\u2019m sure there are bad ones out there just the same as there are great ones out there.", "So you think everyone should have a shit education to keep it \u201cfair\u201d.
