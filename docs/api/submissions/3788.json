{"id": 3788, "submission_id": "zav8gd", "title": "AITA for not letting my son move out and take over his sister's apartment?", "selftext": "Last year, my daughter (26F) moved out of our family home and into a nice 1-bedroom apartment. It's a little over 700 square feet for $1089 rent a month. From what I understand (and what she insists over and over), that amount of room for that price is a steal in this economy.\n\nMy son (21M) is currently in his junior year of college with an on-campus part-time job he just got a few months ago. Recently, my daughter told us she is going to move to another state and offered our son to take her apartment, with all the furniture and appliances she bought for it included.\n\nShe's also switched into a higher-paying job, and also offered to pay the rent while my son's part-time job can cover the rest of his expenses (food, gas, etc.) while we continue paying car insurance, his phone bill and so on.\n\nPer my daughter's reasoning, by time her brother graduates, rent will only be more expensive while \"wages will stay the same\", so she says if he waits to find his own place until he graduates college and finds a job, he will be out of luck. My son is also in a STEM major, and there's a lot more competition for his job market, so he might have a harder time finding a well-paying full-time job after graduation and will have to live at home much longer.\n\nNo doubt my daughter's offer is generous, but my husband and I strongly feel it would be the wrong choice for him. We want him to focus on school without having to be distracted by supporting himself and any possible money troubles. For example, if he loses his part-time job for any reason, he will be screwed.\n\nIt's also obviously cheaper to live at home and save all his part-time money. And if he needs to live at home for a few more years after his graduation, it is not the end of the world. We've also just got around to our daughter leaving the nest last year, and we are not emotionally quite ready to be total empty nesters yet, but we admit that reason is for our own self-interest. :-)\n\nWe told our son about our concerns, and he later turned down our daughter's offer. Our daughter later called us and said she \"knew we talked him out of it\" and told us not to get in the way. I think our reasons are sound. AITA?\n\nETA: Also, if my daughter lost her job or could not pay his rent for any reason, he would be screwed even more. If that happens, he can't break his lease without a significant fee that would come out our pockets (he has no savings) and we're back to square one: paying his rent and all his expenses when he could have stayed at home rent free and no stress. It is still not a good idea to me.", "created_utc": 1670009686, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zav8gd/aita_for_not_letting_my_son_move_out_and_take/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stay here...\n\nThen why rent? Save here then buy...\n\nPlus do you really need to move out before your married?\n\nWhy move out when you/partner will have on hand childcare etc if/when the time comes/you can afford to do more nice things like vacations by staying here...\n\nYou'll never let him go. Your daughter is 26 and moved out at 25, and your still not fully over it. She offered to cover his rent which is a massive favour to him, was letting him keep the furniture, again a massive favour. But you don't want to and your only reason is you dont want to be empty nesters. Hes going to have to learn to budget for when he does move out. If he looses his job he can get another, just because its part time and not related to his degree doesn't mean that it couldn't happen when he gets a job in his field. \n\nYour not helping him, only holding him back for selfish purposes.", "YTA\n\nHe's an adult, you should let him make his own decisions considering he isn't asking you for money to pay the rent.  That's a great offer that his sister is making him, it's not your place to talk him out of it.", "INFO: does your son want to move out and you talked him out of it or does he agree that it isn't the best choice for him right now?", "YTA, your son will regret turning it down and resent you for talking him out of it. My mom does stuff like that all the time.", "YTA \n\nSister trying to help him be an adult and you trying to keep a child.", "INFO: Did you tell you son you are not ready to be empty nesters or was this something you just felt and did not mention?", "You knowingly held your son back from pursuing an adult and independent life, because you couldn't deal with your prospects of being empty nesters in an adult way, so you manipulated him into thinking he wouldn't be able to hack it in the real world? That's pathetic. YTA. You're like that guy, who kept telling his gf that she stinks, so she would feel so low that she wouldn't leave him. You're the only, who truly stinks here, OP.", "YTA your reasons for keeping him at home are purely selfish, however you try to rationalize it.", "That was a bad call. Almost sounds as if you are afraid of being an empty-nester. Are you sure this was not all about you - and not your son\u2019s financial stability? \n\nYTA", "YTA, you're being so enabling that your daughter was 25 before she left the nest and you're not ready for your 21 year old son to do the same? \n\nHow are they supposed to grow as people? Get life experience? Have a partner or meet someone? \"Oh don't be bothered, my parents pay all my bills and I live with them.\" There is no faster way to run off someone they're interested in. That's pretty important when you're in your 20s. \n\nLet them grow, let them learn, and be a welcoming place if things go bad, but give them a chance first.  \n\nYou already pay most of his bills... Do you also check his homework for school and wake him up in the morning with breakfast and his backpack all ready for the day? Do you do his laundry? Make sure he has gas in his car? Do you need to sign his permission slips for field trips and to watch R rated movies? \n\nIf you do those things, he's a child you failed to allow to grow up. If not, quit smothering the man and let him go.", "YTA and your daughter is right you completely manipulated him. I guarantee if he lost his job for some reason, he could get another one. His field is in demand! And yes his specific gaming field, I don\u2019t know where you live but he may need to relocate once he graduates, but he will not have a hard time working in that field. My friends daughter is currently majoring in the sane thing at a state school is California and has been offered two study abroad programs already (interning with highly skilled companies while still going to school) I\u2019m guessing you would tell him a bunch of reasons why he shouldn\u2019t do that either.", "YTA- why are your wants more important than his?

HE IS AN ADULT!!!  He needs to start making decisions for himself.  With the housing market as it is right now, this was a sweet deal.  Also, STEM careers are in high demand.  I'm sure he'll be able to find a job that will support him in this apartment in no time.  You need to let him go.", "If he loses his job he can move back. Or get another job. Be careful not to hold on too tight and thus drive him away", "you would not be the asshole if you had an adult conversation with your adult son about what the best financial decision would be for him.  But to \"not let\" your adult son have anything DISTANTLY RESEMBLING independence is super messed up.  YTA my friend", "YTA for the 'not being ready to be empty nesters' comment. \nI can understand your concerns about the financial implications and it's fine to talk about that with all involved, but ultimately he's an adult and should move out when he was ts to, not when you're ready for it.", "YTA. He\u2019s an adult. stop.", "YTA. Leave you grown kids alone", "YTA it wasn't your place to get involved.", "YTA a little. Let the young man grow up. If any of the worse case scenarios actually happen, your son could move back home unless you are petty and say \"no, we told you so\".", "To quote a fellow redditor: I could not hear a thing you said over that giant helicopter! \n\nYTA, obviously \ud83d\ude44", "NAH... \n\nI ended up in similar situation to what your daughter offered your son... And it is part of the reasons my partner and I haven't been able to buy a house yet and also part of why I dropped out... And I'm from a place where education and cost of living are fairly cheap... \n\nI strongly encouraged all of my friends who had the opportunity to stay home while in school to do so and pile up as much money as possible!", "NTA. I think this is sound advice to stay at home until you are out of school. If he has to work more to pay his bills then his school work suffers. Ultimately it was his decision to turn down the offer. He will have plenty of time to be an adult when he graduates.", "NTA - he has his whole life to struggle, he should take advantage of not having bills to save up an emergency fund before he moves out", "I mean nta. You explained why you think he should be should stay, and he accepted your offer. No harm no foul. What concerns me is why your daughter was as upset as you made it seem. But regardless no he made the smarter move especially if he's only part time, hours can differentiate between 10 and 30. I couldn't pay my own bills for that little", "NTA. \n\nI find it funny that everyone here is all like \"he's an adult and entitled to live his life\". If that's true then he's adult enough to make his choice between the apartment and parent's house. Y'all can't have it both ways. Either he's adult enough to make his choice or too young and got manipulated in which case he clearly wasn't mature enough to handle living alone. \n\nAt the end of the day the son, the adult, chose to stay home. And I don't blame him. He was given the choice of only need to worry about studies and have everything else taken care of for him while having a part time job to fund his fun money vs having a full apartment he needed to take care of while relying on his sister to pay his rent... geez I wonder why he picked the easy way out. Sounds like such a difficult choice \ud83d\ude44.\n\nI wonder if all the y t a are people jealous because they had to be on their own and \"build character\" the hard way instead of having a supportive parental network to make studying and entering adult life easier...", "YTA for not letting your son move out and take over his sister's apartment. While you may have valid concerns about your son's financial stability and ability to focus on school, ultimately it is his decision whether to move out or not. By not allowing him to make that decision for himself, you are not respecting his autonomy and ability to make his own choices. Additionally, you are potentially hindering his growth and independence by not allowing him to take on more responsibility. It may be difficult to let go and trust that your son can handle this situation, but it is important to allow him the opportunity to make his own decisions and learn from any potential mistakes.", "NAH but I strongly disagree with your decision.  My daughter (34) and son (32) learned a lot of valuable life lessons by living off campus their senior years.  If the lease is year-to-year your son can return home later.  It is very important that young adults experience living on their own.  Without housemates he will have no problem focusing on his studies.  \n\nI understand it\u2019s hard to let go, but listen to your daughter and trust your son to be successful.  Be a safety net, not a crutch.", "YTA. You may very well have just cost your son thousands of dollars in rent when he goes apartment hunting in the future. The very idea that you would \"let\" your son move out is insane. He doesn't need your permission. Cut the umbilical cord, find a hobby, and take your claws out of your kids. It sounds like your daughter knows how controlling you are and was trying to help her brother gain the independence you seem hellbent on denying him. Hopefully both of your kids will eventually find good therapists on the other side of the country.", "YTA. What you are doing is suffocating.", "YTA. Cut the cord. If any of your dream scenarios come to pass, your adult children can figure out how to deal with it.", "YTA. Your reasons are selfish and he is an adult. You should have not butted in.", "Oh my GOD, what the Helicopter Parents? He is f**king TWENTY ONE. YT(huge)A.", "NTA. You helped your son decide not to waste a huge amount of money to let his sister play Lady Bountiful.", "Info: If your son wanted to move would that have been what he would have done? Basically, other than explaining your reasoning, are you actively stopping him from being able to move into her apartment? (Guilting, threatening to withhold support, forbidding it\u2026) The title of the post seems like you are forbidding it, but the post content seems like you two had a conversation why you basically say he\u2019d save money by staying home and that you would like him to stay home. \n\nI think that moving out/living away from parents is a major part of growth for a young person. But I want more information on this conversation.", "So basically you don't want your son to move into the Apartment because YOU aren't ready to be empty nesters\n\nQuit trying to make this all about how you think it's a bad decision for your son and just admit it's all about you\n\nYTA", "NAH but soft YTA\n\nIt certainly seems like you're pressuring your son to stay. There are certain advantages, and the main emotional advantage is yours: you are not ready to be an empty nester. \n\nThe money problems seems minor. His sister would be paying his rent. If he lost his job now -- would you not give him a little food allowance, or even loan it to him? What would you do if he still lived in the house? Since all three locations need to be near for this situation to work, would he not be allowed to come home to eat? \n\nHis part time job is not going to be a substantial amount of money - it's fun money right now while you're supporting him or maybe he can save enough to buy a vehicle or something he likes. He's going to need to learn how to budget and it's nice he can do it when either his sister or you are supporting him. \n\nHis sister is doing a really nice thing for him. She's seeing the above. But also, if she doesn't do this, she has to deal with the hassle of what to do with her stuff and her lease. She's going to be paying the rent anyway and someone might as well use the apartment. \n\nIf your son doesn't want to move out, for real, that's fine. But I can't see any 21 year old not making the step to be a little more independent from you if rent was that easy.  He might be concerned you wouldn't support his schooling anymore if he moved out.", "YTA\nIf your son is over 18, you need to butt out of his business. You need to let him make his own decisions about his own life. You are no longer the authority figure. You don't have the right to \"let or \"not let\" him do anything anymore and the sooner you start respecting your kids as adults, the better your long term relationship with them will be.\n\nI think you are thinking of yourself first, youre disguising your feelings about  becoming empty nesters as concern for your son, and trying to delay the inevitable changes coming with your son reaching adulthood. You can try to justify it however you want, but you know deep down this is coming from selfishness and YOUR wants.", "NAH\n\nYour title is misleading unless you are literally telling him and somehow restraining him from moving out, or unless you are being completely biased against him moving out.\n\nIf you are just telling him your concerns and he makes the decision not to do it, then in general NAH. Idk your exact conversation and there are nuanced things you can say.\n\nAs long as you are transparent about your concerns and why you don't want him to move out, including the empty nest personal selfish request (like literally told him how you told us that it's a personal, selfish reason). He can take whatever you tell him and do as he sees fit. \n\nNow if you are presenting him an ultimatum to not move out or are unduly influencing him to stay with you then YTA. \n\nBut if you aren't then the reasons you brought up are valid. He can save money while living with you and focus on college, spending his money on fun stuff or saving instead of having to pay ever increasing living expenses.", "NTA\n\nAs long as you didn't guilt trip or berate him and instead discussed pros and cons, this is reasonable. \n\nI'm not a parent but I had this conversation with my little sister when she was in college. Moving out and attaching yourself to a lease is a big financial move. With him in school and having limited availability to find just any job and work whatever hours they give for money, it is a risk. School is more important right now and he needs to know what the risks are. These are conversations that should be had with young adults so they can make the best decision for himself. \n\nWhile the sisters offer to pay rent is generous, there is a possibility that one day she'll lose her job or get into a financial jam of her own and be unable to pay. Heck, she could get mad and decide she just won't. I've had this happen when I stupidly took over a lease for my sister on a 3 bedroom since she needed to move. The agreement was she would continue to pay half because I did this as a favor instead of moving into a one bedroom I already applied for. 3 months later and she decided she didn't want to anymore and guess who was left scrambling?! Me!", "Jeez no one can win with these redditors.\n\nYou guys call people out for kicking their kids out normally and now you're calling her out for offering him a better deal and place to stay? What is it with you guys?\n\nNTA. Your deal was a better deal, period. The way I see it, if you are in a position to help your kids and make their lives easier, why not do it? Just because he's at home doesn't make him \"any less of an adult\" like many of these people are saying.", "Nah. She gave her opinion, you gave yours, he made a choice", "NAH. \n\nBoth you and your daughter will be paying some of his expenses, therefore both have a say. His housing is free either way, so long as you didn't purposefully argue with him about it and actually let him decide which he liked better then that's all there is to it.", "NTA if he can stay with you for even a few years and all of you are happy why should he take on the responsibility of the bills and such. \n\nTho I would like to say that my husband basically went from him parents house to our house and I wish he had moved out and been responsible for his own home for at least 6 month before we met. I think it would have helped to have him understand caring for his own space. But he came from a home with more traditional gender roles and mom did all the house work.", "NTA. Sounds like your son is smart, understood the conditions, and made his own decision. Your daughter should respect that.", "NTA she made a very generous offer but you explained your side and he made the decision. If you\u2019re paying for his school it\u2019s not outrageous to ask that he concentrates on his studies", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Help him understand, not decide. He is an adult and is definitely old enough to make his own choices. And once again, your main reasons is to avoid being \"empty nesters\" out of self-interest.

All of your financial points are valid, but at some point he will need to be able to understand & handle all of those adult responsibilities.  Letting it happen now gives him the cushion of mom, dad & sister to help out financially and time to recover his credit if things go horribly south.  \n\nYou talked him out of spreading his adult wings and are not being supportive in his transition to adulthood.  \n\nHow healthy is it for a young adult to be living at home and having mommy & daddy paying his phone & insurance bill, for years?
