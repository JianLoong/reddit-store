If I'm not mistaken, at least in the US, talking about pay is a protected conversation topic and employers trying to ban or punish it is not entirely legal. The only reason any employer would tell you not to discuss pay with your peers is because it gives you and your fellow line staff bargaining power.", "NTA\n\nAsk them to point out in the employee handbook where it states this.\n\nThe reason they don't like it is because adds leverage to you.   \n\"Why is Cheryl getting 3x the pay rise I am when we do the exact same job\"\n\nYou did put them in an awkward position. One in which you have more power.", "Nta, funnily enough I was in the same situation a few months ago. Got blames for lowering down morale but when youre over worked and understaffed what was the boss expecting?", "NTA. There are a variety of reasons why management doesn't want employees to share certain information amongst themselves and none of them are to the benefit of the employees (or the work environment). They don't want you grumbling together because they know they're treating you poorly, good luck in your job search.", "NTA. If your employer doesn't want you talking about pay that's a sure sign you should be talking about pay.", "NTA.  What is bringing down morale is sub-standard pay for the work being done, not your talking about it.  You did nothing wrong and it is perfectly acceptable (and legal) to discuss pay with your fellow workers.", "NTA, they know that they\u2019re massively underpaying all of you. You picked up on this and demanded more. They\u2019re likely already unhappy with this but figured they could just offer you a little bit of a raise (still probably not nearly what you deserve), shut you up, and keep underpaying everyone else. They\u2019re now mad that you thwarted this plan. They\u2019re TA here but if you can, leave the company and go work at a place that doesn\u2019t mind employees talking to each other about pay because they\u2019re all fairly compensated.", "NTA.

Most employers don't want employees to talk about pay rates with other employees so that they don't figure out they are being screwed! You didn't do anything wrong but based on your employers reaction they most certainly did.", "You are categorically NTA. The only entity that benefits from employees **not** talking about their respective salaries is the company employing them. Whilst you look for other jobs, comp your new salary with similar posts and see where you rank. \n\nImho your boss saying they would 'look into bandings' is a way of allowing time to pass while you make peace with the salary you're on - it's almost certainly something they would/should know....", "NTA.  It is not illegal (in the US) to discuss pay with coworkers, no matter what the company would have you believe.

Unfortunately there aren\u2019t many employee rights where I live - I think not talking about pay may even be in my contract", "Check the labour laws in your region.

Offers flexible working, great maternity leave, profit share etc but it\u2019s notorious for basic pay being a lot less than industry average.

It's the kind of case labor lawyers salivate over if it's in writing.", "Do you live and work in the US? Because wage discussions are a federally protected conversation and putting it in a contract that you can\u2019t discuss it is illegal. Employers can\u2019t retaliate if you and your coworkers are having those discussions. You can file a complaint with the labor board. I\u2019d keep a copy of that contract if they try to fire you or push you out.", "I wish I had known this way back in one of my previous call center jobs!!", "I mean, you know. The bar is basically on the floor for what workers get. So, good for them for going above the bare minimum? Uh? Sure? But if the pay sucks, the pay still sucks. You\u2019re NTA for talking about it. Health insurance shouldn\u2019t be used as a \u201cperk\u201d to keep you quiet about low pay. I mean that happens all the time, but it\u2019s fucked, and nothing will change unless people talk. Don\u2019t worry about talking."]}
