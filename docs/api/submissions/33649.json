It's a bizarre request", "I'm going to say NAH but you need to talk more. \n\nNAH in his favor because during a couple's own wedding, it's VERY reasonable and normal for them to ask close family members for help watching their kids, keeping them on cue, etc. It's just really hard to do this up at the front of the church during your own ceremony! Maybe if Martha had a family member who could be point person for her kids, then you could be for your brother's. \n\nNAH in yours because your concerns about doing a family unification ceremony with four kids who don't want to be unified, and whether Martha's kids you don't know will even listen to you, are very valid. Figuring out whether the kids will participate in this family ceremony, or if they can skip that portion, will be something the couple needs to figure out with their kids BEFORE the wedding. If they're not agreeing to do it beforehand, nobody can make them. Maybe if you approached your brother from the perspective of \"how do we make this work for you and all the kids,\" and not just \"it's too much for me personally,\" he would reconsider.", "NTA They should drop the idea of a family ceremony. The kids probably won't cooperate no matter what you say or do. Show your brother and future sil all of the posts about people who despise their parents for this very thing.  They are trying to force their children to accept their new spouse and the spouses children as their own family. And years later, they still have resentment. They need to pump the breaks on this wedding, or they are going to have four very hurt and resentful children on their hands. It will definitely not be a happy household.", "NTA. While it was very generous of your brother to take you in and raise you after your parents died, it is not at all comparable to what he and Martha are asking of you. All of the kids are unhappy about this marriage, and their parents are trying to make you the kid's prison guard during the wedding.  You were right to refuse, the kids will need one adult in their lives who will respect their feelings.\n\nThey should be taking to the kids to therapy, not to get them on board and do this marriage/\"family ceremony\"; but to give the kids a safe place to express and process their feelings.", "NTA Could you say, \u201cI\u2019d be willing to babysit, but I\u2019m not willing to try to force them to participate in the ceremony?\u201d", "Martha is right. You should respond: \n\nMartha, you\u2019re right. My brother and Emily stepped in to raise me when I was 9 after I lost my parents. They became de facto parents to a child who was grieving. I owe them everything.\n\nThey taught me how to make good decisions and to put others before myself. It\u2019s time for me to repay the favor. \n\nI am not doing it bc I don\u2019t think my brother is making good decisions or putting his grieving children\u2019s needs above his own. I will not stand for it, just as he and Emily taught me not to stand for it. The best way I can repay him and honor the memories of my parents and Emily is to refuse to participate in forcing his children, and yours, to do something they don\u2019t want to do. \n\nI love my brother and I love my niblings and it is in that love that I\u2019m going to have to decline. Again. \n\nThank you for reminding me of what I owe my brother and Emily. \n\nNTA, OP. You\u2019re an adult now. You\u2019re kinda adrift at such a young age and that SUCKS! My 20 year olds still live at home bc I want to support them as much as possible as they go out and find their way. It seems like you don\u2019t have that support. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not fair to you. But now is the time to find your voice and stand tall. No one else is going to do it for you bc there is no one else to do it. \n\nThis is a bad idea and you should have a talk with your brother. Tell him you love him and support him and you\u2019ll always be there to help pick up the pieces when things go wrong but the cost of that support is that he has to hear your opinion when it\u2019s necessary. \n\nAnd tell him that is Martha throws his support for you back in your face one more time that you\u2019ll go NC with her so quick that her head will spin. She\u2019s trying to manipulate you and she\u2019s putting a cost on what your brother did that isn\u2019t hers to place- after the fact, at that. When it happened before any of you even knew that she existed, on top of all of it. \n\nYou got this!!", "NTA.  How are you supposed to make sure the kids go up to participate? If they are stubborn and refuse,  your brother and his fianc\u00e9e will blame you for ruining the wedding.", "NTA, if they can't even control their kids how can they expect you or literally anyone else too?", "NTA. It's heartwarming, all your brother has done for you, but it doesn't mean you can \"help them out\" by working miracles. You are not a child psychologist. You are not a drill sergeant. You are still very young and have only limited experience wrangling kids. Your reasoning is very smart and farsighted. Agreeing to this would be setting yourself up for all sorts of failure, and they would only be mad at you for not succeeding at the impossible.", "NTA but you need to sit down with him alone and have a come to Jesus talk with your brother. Because going through with this wedding despite none of the children being on board is going to cause a world of resentment", "NTA, if you think it will help to clarify that your happy to watch out for the kids but not force them to participate, then you can say that. I also think it's fair to add that having a relative of Martha's do the same would be best, since you don't have the same rapport with them.\n\nBut if your brother and Martha are dead set on forcing the kids into the being anything beyond present and polite, you should be honest that you're not comfortable with that and don't think it's realistic to expect that to happen. TBH,  even the kids just being present and polite might be a tough ask and I wouldn't blame you for not wanting to be anywhere near this mess.", "NTA.  I think everybody has covered all the main issues here with the kids being on board. One thing that gives me some serious aggravation is Martha joining in with trying to convince you to do this based on \u201call that your brother has done for you\u201d.  That\u2019s between you and your brother (and his late wife) and as you were a minor at the time, while you can be grateful for what he did, it should not be held over your head as a means of manipulation-that isn\u2019t what family does. Martha joining in with the cajoling using that as her stance, really bothers me and I think your brother is really setting himself up for some trouble. I don\u2019t think Martha really understands the family dynamic she is marrying into and I think your brother is being a bull in a china shop right now.  I encourage you to do what you can to stay close to your niblings if this whole mess continues forward, I have a feeling they will really need you.", "NTA.\n\nAnd, honestly, the problem isn't with the kids. It's with the 2 adults. If the kids are already not happy with the idea, are the parents actually thinking this through, properly? \n\nIf the kids were on board, would you be more willing to help? I would be, as there's a difference between babysitting excited but happy kids and playing peacekeeper.", "What your brother did for you, he did out of love. You did not ask for it and have no obligation to pay him back for it. I would have a conversation with them and explain that it isn't about you not wanting to help, but you don't want to start your relationship with the kids as an enforcer. Additionally, maybe it is a good time to start spending time with the kids? It sounds like they could use another adult to go to for support during this transition. NTA", "NTa fuck that, they shouldn\u2019t be throwing that back in your face to wrangle 4 unhappy kids to do something they don\u2019t want to do. Tell your brother to listen to his kids and put this all on pause", "Maybe you should suggest a rehearsal now. If the kids do not listen to you now, they would definitely not for the big event. This could be your out.", "NTA\n\nYou'd probably do anything for him but forcing the kids into something just isn't something you can do. Watching the kids, sure, that'd be nothing, but you cannot agree to make sure they participate in something they don't want to participate in. \n\nIt isn't taking a necessary pill or eating their vegetables, though it'd be impossible to force those things too. You can sit with them but you cannot make them do this.", "NTA - your brother didn't seriously take in a 9 year old and expect them to repay them for it when they were older? That's a real asshole move. As is trying to force a family when the kids have (understandably) complex feelings about it and are grieving their mother. \n\nYour question is wrong though - he's not asking you to watch his kids, which I suspect you would be ok with in most other situations, he's expecting you to help strongarm them into this family bonding ceremony because he can't be there to force them up on stage himself. \n\nYou're right to want no part in it. If you do the kids will likely hold it against you, and you won't ever be a safe or secure person to them again. This is a healthy boundary to have, and your brother is an asshole to hold caring for you over you like this.", "NTA - But you need to nip Martha and your brother\u2019s argument (in the last lines of post) right now. Your brother did a great thing for you, but he chose to do it. He did not have to. And you don\u2019t owe him anything for it. That\u2019s not how raising a child works. You are not required to do whatever he and his wife want for the rest of your life because of it.

Your brother and his future wife will be if they force their kids to do this, which it sounds like they have zero issue doing. You see so many blended family issues here on AITA and this feels like the prequel to one we\u2019ll see in a few years.", "I disagree.  He doesn't want her to watch the children, he wants her to force them to do something they don't want to do.", "I worry that they will take them to therapy in the belief that the therapist will fix them, rather than to listen.", "Yeah talk about guilt tripping someone into doing something crappy.\n\nNTA", "How do you sort of attend therapy?", "Look, this is basically like throwing yourself on a hand grenade.  You do that to save your brother's life.  Not wrangle four pissed off kids to make nice for photo opportunities and whatever treacly togetherness BS the parents are trying to do.", "Take all 4 out for ice cream and skip the wedding?", "That's the parents job. Not only that it's weird he thinks you can keep them in line when they don't want to go in the first place. It's going to be a disaster", "Unfortunately, your brother is destroying his relationship with his kids. If you do this, you will damage your relationship with your nephew and niece too. They need someone to stand up and tell them what they are feeling. It might be worth talking to your niblings to figure out what they think.", "That's basically what I said...that the watching of just the brother's own kids during the ceremony is perfectly reasonable, the family ceremony with unwilling kids is a problem and OP should talk to the brother about it.", "I read it as he wanted both.", "Yea, that's like 90% of watching children", "Of course, that will be their motivation, but a good therapist would stand up for the kids. The kids should have individual therapy as well as family.", "I think they are just trying to use OP to guilt and force their kids to do this. \nSo sad.", "You force everyone to go to a therapist who agrees with you and then totally ignore anything that doesn't conform with the desired outcome. Simple,  but ineffective.", "Probably some religious BS \u201ccounseling.\u201d", "> That\u2019s the parents job\n\nYeah but check this out, they are getting married and will be busy. Thats when you ask for help, as families and communities do when they need help.", "But OP\u2019s not being asked to do that. They\u2019re being asked to force them to do the family ceremony, which we can tell because OP was only asked to do this after it was clear the kids wouldn\u2019t do so willingly.", "We've seen too many stories here about parents dragging stepchildren from therapist to therapist, hoping for one that will be on the parents' side.", "I see you know the therapist my father and stepmother liked!", "You got it. How many times do we see that here?", "I don't understand the therapy worship on this sub.  The world abounds with shitty therapists.  Plenty of them have an entire business model of placating whoever is writing the check. \n\nSecond, therapy only works if you're putting in the effort *and* they're competent.  So forcing kids into it isn't going to do much but resent their parents even more for making them do it on top of what they're going through.", "Good point. Happy cake day", "OP and her brother cannot force their kids to get along at a wedding they don't want", "I guess you're seeing it as black and white (\"here's the plan, yes or no, this conversation is over\") and I'm seeing it as maybe OP could talk to the brother about modifying that plan since they're so close. Maybe not, but neither of us know them personally so your guess is as good as mine.\n\nAlso, some of the comments do imply that asking a family member for help with your kids during your own wedding is always an AH move, so I did want to push back on that.", "Yep, same one tried to convince me God exists.", "Here's the thing, though, while bad therapists abound, and everyone knows therapy doesn't work if you don't do the work, for a lot of the problems on this sub, good therapy is the only thing we've got that works to fix it. You can't take a pill for two weeks and then go \"All fixed! :)\" \n\nAlso, we have a problem bias on this sub. People who are with reasonable people who get that other people aren't vending machines where if you put in (three small children) you don't necessarily get (tightly bonded siblings who always have each other's backs), don't post here.\n\nSo yes, you're right, but at the same time, we have nothing better to offer.", "I mean, the phrase that made me feel confident I understood what was being asked was \u201cand make sure they go up.\u201d", "May I ask how?", "Yeah. I said talk to the brother about that part and it wasn't reasonable.", "It's a lot of empty arguments refuted by logic. This is the problem of clergy counseling. They think theology is actually real.", "Was it clergy counseling? Do they call themselves therapists?", "Even had the framed certificate on the wall. Was as unbiased as you would expect though. /s"]}
