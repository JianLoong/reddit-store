We are staying here until I can get a remote job and he can get a better one where we can actually afford to save money to buy a house. We live in a 2 story house with unfortunately only one kitchen which is downstairs. My husband and I along with our children live upstairs and my parents live downstairs. We spend most of the day downstairs because my children enjoy spending time with my mother and she helps me out a lot with them. Anyway, we call the upstairs \u2018our house\u2019 and the downstairs \u2018their house\u2019. We offered to pay rent/utilities in the past but my father refused to accept any money from us, we insisted a few times but decided to let it go when he wouldn\u2019t budge. My father is a truck driver so he is home every 2 weeks or so. My grandmother from my mother\u2019s side is currently visiting from Europe so there\u2019s a lot of people in the house.We have 2 boys, a 2 and a half year old and a 9 month old. My 9 month old recently started crawling so I decided to get him a playpen for when we are downstairs.When  I wanted to assemble it downstairs but my father told me to go assemble it upstairs cause \u2018there\u2019s enough shit here that everyone trips over anyways\u2019.Okay no problem, I went upstairs and assembled it to which my mother got mad because I didn\u2019t assemble it downstairs as she and I discussed it before.My father threw a tantrum because I have so many baby things downstairs, and yes, there was a crib, a bouncer and now there would also be a playpen for the LO.My mother got upset and brought the playpen downstairs to which my father said \u2018oh yeah bring more shit here, there\u2019s not enough, with the crib and the bouncer and the toys, yeah why don\u2019t you bring that shit here too?\u2019This hurt me, because in not so many direct words,he basically told me that my sons stuff bothers him, it made me feel like my son\u2019s presence bothers him as well..So I got upset and removed EVERYTHING that was my son\u2019s and brought them upstairs. I was so pissed off about it,because no one ever thinks about my feelings, especially my father, he always says the most hurtful things and doesn\u2019t even care or realize how much his words hurt me..Anyway, a little after I brought everything upstairs, my grandmother came to me and told ME that I don\u2019t know how to act, I am disrespectful towards my father by doing that blah blah. Like, EXCUSE ME? NOW IT\u2019S SOMEHOW MADE TO BE MY FAULT?  I have changed my view of my grandmother after I had kids,my word means nothing when it comes to my children and what I say..the way my father talks to me like I\u2019m a doormat but if I stand up for myself SHE will be the first one to tell me to shut up because I\u2019m \u201ca child\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t talk back..I am just so done with these people, I\u2019m actually considering moving to my inlaws who live in Germany just to get away.So, reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675656628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ux79o/aita_for_removing_every_single_toybaby_item_from/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. \n\nBut also this seemed more like a fight between your Mom and your Dad with your children's stuff being used as the discussion of the fight. It doesn't make it right but the focus seems to be more on your opinions of your Grandma and Father more than protecting your own children from hearing their Grandfather and Grandmother fight over where that shit goes. Cuz lemme tell you that shit is gonna last.

There are so many ways in which being an expat is complicated and/or expensive. You have no job, no substantial savings, and are stressed out yet fantasizing about a choice that requires a job, hoovers up money, and heaps on added stressors.", "When you're paying the bills, you get more of a say. \n\nHow are you planning to find this cross continent move btw?", "You aren't the victim here, no matter how you try to play it off. Two kids without the resources to take care of them, living in \"toxic\" environment. It's Dad giving me free room and board to Dad running over me & a bad influence to I don't want to hurt them by leaving. You keep digging yourself into a deeper hole.", "We lived in Florida and houses were getting ridiculously expensive. To rent and to buy. \n\nIt's a big step, but since you guys have the opportunity...\n\nThink about your own kids and decide where you guys would have a better future...it's not about your parents anymore it's about your family", "Your mom might be but from what you said your dad would be happy. I\u2019d tell him he got what he wanted", "No. i feel so sorry for your dad. Germany sounds like a good plan. Let you and your kids be their problem", "You seem a little too close to the situation to see your own behavior clearly.", "Judgment is made off of what you wrote.\nYou wrote you have no money.\nYou wrote you live rent free. (You wrote you've offered to pay rent so I'm not sure why you can't move out)\nYou have an entire floor to yourselves\nYou brought your (child's) stuff to their part of their house, as though the whole place is yours.\nAfter all that, you whine when your Dad wants some space in his house.\nQuite the sense of entitlement.\nThe translation I got from your situation -\nAITA for picking up after my kid where I am a guest?\n\nYTA for not doing it in the first place & YTA for thinking you're entitled to space that doesn't belong to you. YTA for complaining about what a bad person he is while living in his home, rent free. YTA for even wondering if YTA in this situation.", "Ok. That explains the first child. What about the 2nd?", "honestly if he's like that it's probably best to move to Germany before your boys try to emulate grandpa, NTA", "So you're two broke adults with a child living with your parents and complaining that your father doesn't want a playpen in his living area. You offer to pay rent but you're too broke to rent an apartment but you're saving for a home? And you have immigration fees and you got scammed? It sounds like you, your husband and child are lucky to have a comfortable home all things considered.", "Then you should appreciate the free place to live you have and do your best not to inconvenience the people you live with.  That includes not having tons of your stuff cluttering up their living space.", "From OP's language and description of the fight it sounds like this isn't the first time a fight like this has happened in the home. My concern is that she's focusing more on her father and grandmother's opinions than protecting her family. They have to pick whether to keep the baby stuff downstairs or upstairs and not have the father go complain either way regardless of what she does and if he does either way just keep the baby stuff upstairs and out her foot down about that. There needs to be a conversation and a clear boundary of keeping the literal screaming matches between the father and mother away from the kids' environment.", "Find someplace better for your kids then. Pretend that you don't have the resource of free room & board.\n\nNow YTA for exposing your kids to this toxic environment.", "Urgh that is not good. On a day soon when he isn\u2019t mad and perhaps when the grandmother is gone do talk to him. Explain you want to make this situation work and what would he like to see happen?", "yeah, OP. you\u2019re being treated like children because you\u2019re acting like children. you\u2019ve moved a family of four into a house that doesn\u2019t belong to you for FREE. stop waiting for a remote work job to fall into your lap, get up and start applying to entry-level positions. my parents moved to the states with a few hundred dollars to their names. they worked their asses off for years to give me and my brother the life they thought we deserved. they WORKED. they received support from family, but never came to depend on it because they were adults who could go get jobs and make some money.", "If that's what you have to do, its what you have to do.  At a bare minimum I'd start reaching out to your husband's family, any extended family your on good terms with and at least get a sense of if they can give you any financial support to get you out of the situation your in.  \n\nWhether that's somewhere else in the states, or to Germany.  \n\nWhile your lining that up, just do your best to soothe over tensions.  \n\nGood luck OP, and Godspeed.", "Holy crap I missed that", "But she literally did what she was asked to do. I think her point was she was upset that her mom told her one thing while her father told her another.\nLike, she moved everything upstairs because her father was upset. But then her mother was upset she moved everything upstairs and didn\u2019t leave it downstairs. Kind of makes it an impossible situation.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like she\u2019s purposely freeloading. She\u2019s offered to pay rent, etc. \n\nYeah, the post sounds kind of whiney, but I don\u2019t think that makes her an AH. The \u201cno one is considering my feelings,\u201d just makes me view her to be overwhelmed by the two opposite demands. \n\nShe does something she\u2019s asked to do by her father, she gets scolded by her mother. If she does something asked by her mother, she gets scolded by her father. Like I said, just seems like an overwhelming and impossible situation.", "You offered to pay but you can\u2019t right, because you don\u2019t have any money? \n\nAre you working, is your husband working? If you\u2019re saying that you could pay for half the mortgage why don\u2019t you put that money aside and save up for a deposit for your own place? \n\nIn the meantime, your dad is working and paying for everything so when he\u2019s off work maybe try to make his environment pleasant so that he can relax. \n\nKeep the baby stuff upstairs. You can always bring a few items downstairs and use for a bit and then bring it back upstairs. You have a whole level to yourself and don\u2019t need the whole house. Even if your mum would like it, your dad doesn\u2019t and he lives there too. Invite your mum upstairs more.", "1300sq ft. which has 95% of the kids stuff.", "You are 100% right, I do dig myself in a deeper hole and I am trying to work on it. I want to have a better future for my kids and I know I can be an asshole sometimes too, but I am trying my best to repair my broken self.", "Does not sound like you have children, or if you do, you probably haven\u2019t reminded them their whole life that everything they own is actually yours because you paid for it, oh and when they have their own stuff, you find other arguments because now you can\u2019t just take away their stuff because you didn\u2019t buy them.", "Makes you wonder how long they've been living there with both children, since they are \"saving up\" for a house of their own, and the answer to her problems is not to rent an apartment, but rather to move to Germany and do the same thing to her in-laws. Oh yes, and no job will do unless it's remote. Like you can't be an adult and schedule opposite shifts from your spouse.", "I understand your POV, I did not say we\u2019re not lucky, I just want for the arguments and treating me and my husband like children to stop. I know it sounds terrible, maybe I shouldn\u2019t complain, but if you\u2019d be in my situation with a father who ALWAYS reminds you that you have your things only because of him at every little argument maybe you\u2019d see my POV of this post. Every time we argue he brings up the fact that everyone living in the house is there because of him, he brings up almost everything he helped us with. Not even that, he does it to my uncle too. When my uncle first moved here, my father helped him find his first job and he will NEVER let my uncle forget that. My uncle doesn\u2019t even want to come visit anymore because of that.", "That's the thing though OP made plans with mom for the play pen downstairs, Dad disapproved so OP took it upstairs \n\nMom disapproved so took play pen downstairs.  \n\nDad disapproved so OP took it upstairs.  \n\nThen Grandma disapproved.  \n\nSo to make Grandma happy it should go back downstairs, but then...\n\nWe're running in circles.  Where no ones happy and everyone is getting angrier.", "Did you miss where she said her MOM wanted that stuff downstairs? OP is caught between her mom and her verbally abusive, angry dad...", "This is just a man who\u2019s frustrated and tired of tripping over baby stuff. He is communicating clearly and setting a boundary for how he\u2019d like his own living room to be. It\u2019s not being respected and he\u2019s upset. \nThere is a whole upstairs area for the upstairs family. They have a roof over their head thanks to dad. The better course of action is to be grateful to him for helping out, try to not annoy him, save up money and then leave and get their own place.", "Yep. I don't agree with granny being all up in it, but when even your mother in law is on your side...", "Eh my take here is that dads being an asshole (and mom) but that doesn\u2019t make op any less of an asshole.\n\nSince OPs mom is taking care of the baby, that tells me she\u2019s home while dad is working. It\u2019s very plausible to me that while gma likes to have baby things around to entertain baby, gpa is getting increasingly annoyed with being the only adult in a household of 4 adults (6 in total) that is contributing and coming home everyday to his designated space covered in baby stuff for a kid that\u2019s not his.\n\nI think the main issue is the disconnect between gma and gpa about how much baby stuff is in their part of the house. They are not communicating and sticking op in the middle which creates infinitely more problems. but she didn\u2019t need to remove every single item from the main floor, she did it to be petty. Everyone here is being very immature and passive aggressive.\n\nWhile it\u2019s nice that they offered to pay rent, it\u2019s kinda a moot point because they moved in specifically to save so it makes sense that her parents would want to help her out by actually saving. What\u2019s not a moot point is the fact that her parents gave her HALF of their house and she still covered the rest of it in her baby\u2019s stuff without asking if it was okay, just assumed. She\u2019s taking advantage of their generosity and now she\u2019s upset because she got called on it.\n\nI 100% agree on it being an overwhelming and impossible situation but she\u2019s not taking any steps to make it better so I still think she\u2019s an asshole. Just a lesser one than everyone else involved.", "That\u2019s a great idea, thank you for the advice, I will definitely not bring any more toys that are not played with downstairs. Learned my lesson there.", "What the fuck is your point? That you\u2019re right? You aren\u2019t.", "So you're father is a jerk and you're not homeless. I'd rather have place to live with a jerk than to be homeless with a child.", "And, her father is a jerk and she, her husband and child can't afford to live anywhere else  It's not ideal but it's a dang sight better than being homeless. Don't get married and have children if you are not in financially able. Sorry, not sorry. Take some responsibility for your own choices.", "Didn't miss it at all.  Her DAD lives there too, and apparently he's the one working and paying the bills (since grandma is available all day every day to help OP with her kids), so dad's opinion on how much baby stuff downstairs is too much matters.   OP has the entire upper floor for her and her family, but the downstairs is also full of her stuff.  Can't really blame grandpa for finding that annoying.", "Women aren't the only ones who get a say. Two yes or it doesn't happen. My husband and I parented that way, and apparently op is still dependent on her parents, so two yes needs to still apply. Mom does not get a bigger vote simply for being mom. Dad has an equal say.", "To me this doesn't sound like that at all, it sounds like two people using something as an argument piece in their chess game of misery. OP has said her father has a temper? Could they have cleaned up before the father arrived? Yes. Would that have stopped him and his wife from having a large argument where kids are in the space? No. Because there's always something else, I grew up in a home like this and there was always something. OP needs to protect their kids and set boundaries with their parents about having these arguments in front/within earshot of the kids", "Yes honestly I just think he\u2019s frustrated and he doesn\u2019t like clutter and just want to be able to relax.", "Your lack of empathy is pretty amazing. You're basically saying it's okay for her dad to be verbally abusive and scream at her for doing what her mom asked her to do because she's in an unfortunate financial situation.", "It's not a lack of empathy, it's the facts. Are you saying her father has absolutely no rights in the home he pays for and maintains? Misunderstandings happen. Some people are jerks but how you conflate that with abuse is beyond me especially if they have no place else to go.\n\nDid OP's mother even bother to consult her husband about how he felt about more kiddie paraphernalia in his living area?"]}
