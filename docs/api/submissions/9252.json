We are staying here until I can get a remote job and he can get a better one where we can actually afford to save money to buy a house. We live in a 2 story house with unfortunately only one kitchen which is downstairs. My husband and I along with our children live upstairs and my parents live downstairs. We spend most of the day downstairs because my children enjoy spending time with my mother and she helps me out a lot with them. Anyway, we call the upstairs \u2018our house\u2019 and the downstairs \u2018their house\u2019. We offered to pay rent/utilities in the past but my father refused to accept any money from us, we insisted a few times but decided to let it go when he wouldn\u2019t budge. My father is a truck driver so he is home every 2 weeks or so. My grandmother from my mother\u2019s side is currently visiting from Europe so there\u2019s a lot of people in the house.We have 2 boys, a 2 and a half year old and a 9 month old. My 9 month old recently started crawling so I decided to get him a playpen for when we are downstairs.When  I wanted to assemble it downstairs but my father told me to go assemble it upstairs cause \u2018there\u2019s enough shit here that everyone trips over anyways\u2019.Okay no problem, I went upstairs and assembled it to which my mother got mad because I didn\u2019t assemble it downstairs as she and I discussed it before.My father threw a tantrum because I have so many baby things downstairs, and yes, there was a crib, a bouncer and now there would also be a playpen for the LO.My mother got upset and brought the playpen downstairs to which my father said \u2018oh yeah bring more shit here, there\u2019s not enough, with the crib and the bouncer and the toys, yeah why don\u2019t you bring that shit here too?\u2019This hurt me, because in not so many direct words,he basically told me that my sons stuff bothers him, it made me feel like my son\u2019s presence bothers him as well..So I got upset and removed EVERYTHING that was my son\u2019s and brought them upstairs. I was so pissed off about it,because no one ever thinks about my feelings, especially my father, he always says the most hurtful things and doesn\u2019t even care or realize how much his words hurt me..Anyway, a little after I brought everything upstairs, my grandmother came to me and told ME that I don\u2019t know how to act, I am disrespectful towards my father by doing that blah blah. Like, EXCUSE ME? NOW IT\u2019S SOMEHOW MADE TO BE MY FAULT?  I have changed my view of my grandmother after I had kids,my word means nothing when it comes to my children and what I say..the way my father talks to me like I\u2019m a doormat but if I stand up for myself SHE will be the first one to tell me to shut up because I\u2019m \u201ca child\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t talk back..I am just so done with these people, I\u2019m actually considering moving to my inlaws who live in Germany just to get away.So, reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675656628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ux79o/aita_for_removing_every_single_toybaby_item_from/", "score": 1754, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He may be like my father in that he doesn't want to come right out and say he doesn't want her there, or that he really enjoys having her there but that realization makes him angrier since he has some reason to make sure she knows her place in his heart. \n\nI was begged to move in to my parent's home (leaving an 85k job in the city and leaving my fabulous and affordable apartment, giving up everything including that paycheck) because my mom was dying and needed constant care and supervision as she kept falling down the stairs, and he was golfing 18+ holes of golf every day (and bragging about it to friends, who looked at me with very confused faces, to which I'd just shrug as I was not falling into that lifelong trap of daring to complain about anything regarding him), eating breakfast out alone and never bringing food back for me and my mom, and sometimes dinner, and inviting their friends over only to ignore her so he could best enjoy their company, while yelling for me to wait on them, which is the role I'd been trained to play my entire life.  \n\nMy father was always against any decision I made yet never proud of my accomplishments. He bragged to his friends when I got a job at the corporate headquarters at a well-known fashion retailer yet in private he wanted to know why I didn't yet have my own office (at 22, not even a full year after graduating from college) and he was furious when, 5 years later after I';d paid off my student loan, I dropped my 2nd job (waiting tables nights and weekends, a schedule that was exhausting) and only worked my 8-5 corporate job so I could pursue my art in my new free time.  \n\nHe refused to get her a nurse even though all the money they had (a lot) was inherited from her parents. He refused to let us move her bed to the first floor because, \"I don't want my living room to look like a sick room! You're managing to carry her up and down the stairs just fine\" (no thanks for that, as usual, just an insinuation that I was lazy for wanting to move her bed downstairs), so I had to play escalator piggyback-style, which resulted in 3 more herniated disks showing up on my next annual MRI 6 months later, on top of the 4 documented herniated disks I already had. \n\nShe was at 85 lbs by then but still, and bending over the bathtub to bathe her was really hard on my back, but it was personally worth it because she was like the happiest little kid in the tub, throwing bubbles in their air and saying, \"I love bubbles!\", while I pretended to go get more towels so she'd not see me cry. I was also changing her a few times a day, and reading to her since he pretended she didn't exist beyond being a burden. I'd come back from grocery shopping to be hit with the smell so I'd ask how long her diaper needed to be changed and he'd say, \"Dunno, I just waited for you to get home to deal with it. That's *your* job.\"\n\nHe'd constantly make comments that I *owe* him grandchildren as he was always  talking about his friends' grandkids, but then he'd tell me to not ever expect him to babysit, even if it's just to go grocery shopping or take mom to her dialysis appointments. It was insane. He complained that I left my dog (he LOVED that dog) with him for an hour to go pick up her prescriptions and some groceries, even though at most all he'd have to do is open the door to let the dog out, and again to let him back in. \n\nAfter she passed he asked me to stay because he worried that he'd be lonely. I tried to tell him that at this point I'd only been gone from the city 5 months and had been offered my job back and my apartment (a suite of rooms inside a good friend's home, which my friend had not yet rented to anyone else bc he didn't like living with people and he hoped I'd be able to come back) but he begged. \n\nSo, I brought him to cocktail parties, to art openings including my own, to readings by local authors (there were quite a few local authors, in college I'd waited on James Baldwin a dozen times, and Kurt Vonnegut, and others), I threw  mock art openings in my studio for him and whichever of his friends who were visiting, spending a lot of money wines, fancy cheeses, pate, and fruits platters, and he and his friends RAVED about these soirees. \n\nOh, and while I lived there I was not allowed to eat, \"his food\", I had to buy all my own food to which he'd help himself if it was more interesting than what he had in the fridge. \n\nTo keep him occupied, since I thought he missed my mom (he didn't, he complained only of being bored and lonely, never once saying he missed her, often even saying he did not miss being \"stuck with a sick woman all his life\") I often had people he found interesting over for dinner, people he'd hint about wanting to meet, people who'd been in the news (and who I knew because the first thing I'd done was get a sublet for part of a larger studio space so I could store my tools and so at least after I put my mom to bed I could go do my own work) including a famous local artist he'd always admired and who was a frequent subject for local press. \n\nThat same artist took me aside after dinner and told me that I do *not* need to let him treat me that way, which believe it or not was a revolutionary life moment for me. His friends and all the family friends and relatives absolutely adored him because they only saw Mr Nice Guy. I always knew better than to share how he acted to me in private as I knew no one would ever believe me. \n\nAnd he had been on his best behavior in front of his idol, he did not even notice how many times she gave me questioning looks, or defended me from his snarky and belittling remarks. A week later I had my bf and his bff, \"Mike\" over for a cookout.  Mike had been in the local news a lot for starting a rather revolutionary business, and I knew my father would appreciate discussing with him the mechanics and construction involved as he'd built our house and he taught mechanics. The next day my bf and Mike took me to lunch and said I should not only stand up for myself but that my brother, who was always at every dinner as he had no real friends, were \"like a clique you will never belong to.\"\n\nIt was good timing that these 3 people had opened my eyes to how obvious was his poor (one person called it sadistic) treatment of me because a few weeks after that dinner he found out that the wife of a very famous local author had asked me (and my dog, the same one he refused to \"babysit\") to sit for a portrait.\n\n he could not stop hinting that he wanted to meet her too, but I refused on that because of how the dinner with the artist had gone, how he'd play my work down and fawn over hers to the point that she got so upset that she said she dreamed of making work like my own someday) the wife would tell me how he never went to her openings because he didn't want people to think they could show up just to gawk at him, to bother him for pictures or an autograph when the focus was supposed to be solely on his wife (a very nice woman, delightful) \n\nI went NC. He passed last year and I'd not seen him in 18 years,  for a list of reasons so long that my therapist kept a spreadsheet, during which time I gained a health measure of self-esteem and became a better person for it.

Is that really too much to ask for.", "She is contributing a mess and a lot of stress! That has to count for something!", "No it\u2019s her lack of common sense that makes her the AH. When you are living with someone else, you don\u2019t take over their personal space which meant that she should stop buying so much stuff that it ends up downstairs. \n\nShe even has the cheek to say their home is upstairs and her parents are downstairs. Then why are they spending so much time downstairs? Do they need to use the kitchen all the time? She is already using the mum as free childcare and use that as an excuse to continue invading their space. \n\nSo even if her mum insists on bringing the stuff downstairs, she should have the self awareness to know that she is invading her parents space and politely decline. I get the vibe that she is putting all the stuff downstairs so her mum can take care of the kids for her under the gist\u201d my kids enjoy spending time with grandma\u201d. The kids are 2.5 and 9months old. They know nothing except play and are closest to the ones that give them the most attention and spend time with them. Kids should be spending more time with the parents not grandparents. \n\nDad probably has tolerated for a long time and finally burst. She really lacks self awareness.", "We don't know that but we know she's not acting like the place is hers? It kind of sounds like she's treating it like that. Also again, why is she allowed to act emotionally but he isn't?", "You can\u2019t just up and love to Germany! Lmfao. If they can\u2019t afford their own place they can\u2019t afford the immigration fees.", "Yes. This is exactly how you do it when you have family. It\u2019s so dumb but this is the dynamic we\u2019re forced to have. Lol so like nobody is the asshole. It\u2019s just family dynamics.", "That\u2019s ridiculous. The person who it affects the most should make the decision, not the person who is barely there. I\u2019m talking mom vs dad here, not OP. \n\nSay you are married & do all the cooking. You got a huge cast iron pan & use it every day to make breakfast & dinner. You keep it on top of the stove bc it\u2019s convenient. Your spouse decides it should be kept in the basement bc it\u2019s in their way once every 2 weeks when they decide to make a can of soup on the stove. \n\nWho should get to decide where the pan lives? The person who uses it every day, or the person that has to move it once every 2 weeks?", "We are just going to have to disagree on this. \n\n What she did was rude. She got told off for being rude. The whole scenario is part of it, not just the I took them upstairs. She didn't take them upstairs when it was brought up the first time. She caused a fight between her parents because she wasn't bothering to limit her mess in the first place. And if she had cleaned up instead of building the playpen, there wouldn't have been this fight to begin with, at least not at this level. Grandma, while she shouldn't have said anything, and especially considering she took her son IN-LAWS side, is probably the closest to being unbiased an observer as humanly possible.\n\n OP was more concerned about what she wanted to grumble about than the upswt she was causing to the entire family and asked an aita trying to be able to do \"see I'm not, vindication\"  by limiting it to two minutes out of probably thirty, given how long the last play pen took me to assemble. It's disingenuous at best.", "How are they even paying the airfare, much less shipping all the kids stuff? She's just expecting her inlaws to take care of her like her parents have been. She needs to grow up.", "The person who it effects the most is the father when he is home from work.  Mom can have complete control when dad is gone, but when he's home, then he gets 50% control over is going on in the house, and there are many decisions that need to be a unanimous \"yes\" from both parents during those times.\n\nHer father isn't gone for weeks at a time because he's vacationing - he's working a demanding job to support his and his daughter's family.  His need to relax and decompress on this time off is essential for the family's short and long term financial stability.", "It\u2019s hard working on the road, though. Dad is away a lot and then when he comes back everything has been rearranged without him. It\u2019s understandable that decisions and arrangements would be made by the people who are there all the time, but some attention still needs to be paid to helping him feel at home and connected, especially since his work away seems to be paying for everything.\n\nIt\u2019s not really the same as someone who\u2019s there and only occasionally cooks.", "I don\u2019t know why people think grandma taking the son-in-law\u2019s side is some sort of unbiased oracle, especially when old world grannies can be very \u201cfather is in charge\u201d kind of thing. OP didn\u2019t cause the fight. OP\u2019s mother told her to bring the playpen down and her father said no. Does she mother, who seemed fine with the house, have no say in how she lives? Is her husband\u2019s word more of a law than hers? Why didn\u2019t OP\u2019s parents hash this out between them, since they\u2019re the two decision makers here."]}
