We are staying here until I can get a remote job and he can get a better one where we can actually afford to save money to buy a house. We live in a 2 story house with unfortunately only one kitchen which is downstairs. My husband and I along with our children live upstairs and my parents live downstairs. We spend most of the day downstairs because my children enjoy spending time with my mother and she helps me out a lot with them. Anyway, we call the upstairs \u2018our house\u2019 and the downstairs \u2018their house\u2019. We offered to pay rent/utilities in the past but my father refused to accept any money from us, we insisted a few times but decided to let it go when he wouldn\u2019t budge. My father is a truck driver so he is home every 2 weeks or so. My grandmother from my mother\u2019s side is currently visiting from Europe so there\u2019s a lot of people in the house.We have 2 boys, a 2 and a half year old and a 9 month old. My 9 month old recently started crawling so I decided to get him a playpen for when we are downstairs.When  I wanted to assemble it downstairs but my father told me to go assemble it upstairs cause \u2018there\u2019s enough shit here that everyone trips over anyways\u2019.Okay no problem, I went upstairs and assembled it to which my mother got mad because I didn\u2019t assemble it downstairs as she and I discussed it before.My father threw a tantrum because I have so many baby things downstairs, and yes, there was a crib, a bouncer and now there would also be a playpen for the LO.My mother got upset and brought the playpen downstairs to which my father said \u2018oh yeah bring more shit here, there\u2019s not enough, with the crib and the bouncer and the toys, yeah why don\u2019t you bring that shit here too?\u2019This hurt me, because in not so many direct words,he basically told me that my sons stuff bothers him, it made me feel like my son\u2019s presence bothers him as well..So I got upset and removed EVERYTHING that was my son\u2019s and brought them upstairs. I was so pissed off about it,because no one ever thinks about my feelings, especially my father, he always says the most hurtful things and doesn\u2019t even care or realize how much his words hurt me..Anyway, a little after I brought everything upstairs, my grandmother came to me and told ME that I don\u2019t know how to act, I am disrespectful towards my father by doing that blah blah. Like, EXCUSE ME? NOW IT\u2019S SOMEHOW MADE TO BE MY FAULT?  I have changed my view of my grandmother after I had kids,my word means nothing when it comes to my children and what I say..the way my father talks to me like I\u2019m a doormat but if I stand up for myself SHE will be the first one to tell me to shut up because I\u2019m \u201ca child\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t talk back..I am just so done with these people, I\u2019m actually considering moving to my inlaws who live in Germany just to get away.So, reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675656628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ux79o/aita_for_removing_every_single_toybaby_item_from/", "score": 232, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. \n\nBut also this seemed more like a fight between your Mom and your Dad with your children's stuff being used as the discussion of the fight. It doesn't make it right but the focus seems to be more on your opinions of your Grandma and Father more than protecting your own children from hearing their Grandfather and Grandmother fight over where that shit goes. Cuz lemme tell you that shit is gonna last. You need to put aside your feelings for a minute and try to keep your kids out of the shitstorm while you can and encourage them to stay upstairs until things cool off then talk to your Dad and Mom about their fuqing atrocious behavior IN FRONT OF YOUR KIDS ABOUT YOUR KIDS.\n\nI don't care if the kids weren't in the room, they likely heard it and if it keeps up they're gonna remember that shit one way or another.

End of the day we would meet my parents for dinner, do bed time routines etc and then haul the toddler and my container of stuff back to my space.

And yes, I have a student loan and YES it was hard because we didn't move close to family after the military but it was doable.
