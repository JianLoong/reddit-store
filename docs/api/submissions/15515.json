As a consumer, you can buy a pre-owned 2 carat loose diamond for ~4-6k. They can definitely go well into the 5 figures, but that's not a standard diamond that you'd see in most people's engagement rings. Obviously, a jeweler is going to pay less than the consumer would. The setting itself just goes for current gold price, because they'd just melt it anyway. Jewelers aren't in it to be a charity, so they're going to build in profit on what they offer. You're better off financially selling it on consignment, but you have to hope you find the right buyer who likes the same style and has the same ring size. \n\nInsurance appraisal is the cost of a replacement. So if the ring were to be destroyed and you went to go buy a brand new diamond ring of the same setting style, same metal, and same diamond specs, what would you expect to pay at retail. Things like the ring setting designer and complexity of the setting matters here, because that affects replacement cost.", "I think ESH\n\nsounds like #3 is being bratty and manipulative about the whole situation, that much is clear. I think it was fair to make the offer to all 3 of your sisters, and basically get a majority vote. Assuming that this email reached #3, I'd say you snooze you loose.\n\nHowever, I don't think $4k is a fair price for this ring. Appraisals typically run high because they want you to feel like what you purchased has value, and it's also the retail value that gets appraised, not the resale value. Having it priced at like cash 4 gold stores, they will always undervalue it because they need to resell it and turn a profit. I think a more fair value would be somewhere in the middle, like $8-10k. 2c diamonds themselves are worth that much, nevermind the setting, unless it's like smokers teeth yellow or heavily included", "ESH\n\nObviously you both feel entitled to the ring for different reasons, without knowing a lot more about your dynamics it is impossible for us to say who is in the (mostly) right. \n\nYour sister sucks for not answering/dragging this out because she can\u2019t have her way, but you taking the ring with only 3/4 agreement is putting the entire thing at risk. \nDepending on the specifics of the law in your country/state, it is very possible that your decision is illegaland your actions are considered theft. \n\nYour sister owns 1/4 of that ring, and while it may be worth 4k in cash, she can easily claim that the senimental value is priceless.

If they were left a house, which only one person can live in, it would make sense for that person to buy the house from the estate so the other recipients still get their fair share of being entitled to 1/4 of the house. Technically all sisters were entitled to the ring (or 1/4 of it) as the estate was meant to be split evenly. OP said nothing was divided up when mom was alive. If there\u2019s 4 sisters and only a few items of large value, not every sister can get something valuable even though they are all equally entitled to 1/4 of the estate\u2019s total value.
