Always put something on top of what you're hiding in the trash.

So your not being sneaky and she doesn\u2019t make it again for you and waste food", "NTA\n\nYou're right, vanilla almond milk mac & cheese is absolutely disgusting. She needs to buy unflavored plant-based milks if she wants to cook savory meals with them.\n\nI won't say they have to be labeled \"unsweetened\" because some \"original\" flavors have some sweetener in them, but only enough to make them as sweet as dairy milk, not sweeter. \n\nThat said, you have to be careful because some \"original\" flavors have some vanilla in them, even if they're not labeled \"vanilla flavor,\" and these taste terrible in savory dishes as well.", "NTA.  Even your description makes me want to wretch.  You didn\u2019t complain.  You tried to be polite.  Your only mistake was not better covering your tracks but even that shouldnt have been cause for gf going off on you.", "NTA - you were polite. Even if it were true that you're picky, so what? Our partners are not the same as us & we can either love & accept that or we move on. The idea that you should have powered through food you don't like for her is wrong. That mac & cheese sounds like a crime against humanity.", "NTA This makes me laugh because I have made Mac and cheese with sweetened almond milk before and it was terrrrrrrible. I probably would have made a joke about it and laughed it off if I were you, but it\u2019s not a big deal", "NTA for not liking it and you are not a picky eater bc of that. But next time don't throw it in the trash and tell her honestly that you don't like it.", "NTA. I've made this mistake before and it's horrible.", "NTA. As long as you were kind to her about it and acknowledged the effort, that\u2019s pretty gross and I wouldn\u2019t have eaten it either.", "NTA sounds gross and why would you eat it? She ate that nastiness?", "NTA.\n\nWhy would you eat something you don\u2019t like the taste of?", "NTA - you tried it, which was considerate, but didn\u2019t like it. Not surprising given the ingredients.   \n\n\nMy wife frequently cooks with stuff like this and we \u2018agree to disagree\u2018 and just eat different stuff on those days.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t eat that shit either lol kraft mac n cheese \ud83e\udd22 and sweetened vanilla almond milk too?? \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e I love vanilla almond milk but no way am I putting that in Mac n cheese I would use water before I do that \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, and also who would think that salt and fake cheese pairs well with vanilla, almonds, and sugar?! I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS.", "NTA that really sounds disgusting. Disregarding the vanilla part, almond milk sounds weird enough but I'm only drinking real milk so I am biased.. but as some other people have said, tell her next time so she knows you don't like it (not to criticize her cooking but rather the ingredients used and that they just don't work together). I can't blame you for throwing it away though...", "INFO. Did she not notice the mistake, even after trying some herself? I have accidentally used vanilla yogurt instead of plain in a savory dish, and it absolutely ruined it. It was impossible not to tell.

Throwing it away without explaining why is rude.", "NTA", "\u201cDont experiment on Thanksgiving!\u201d", "I have a different take:\n\nNAH, just a lack of communication. Yes, sweetened almond milk sounds awful and I wouldn't have eaten it either. It's understandable that you wanted to spare her feelings, but you should've used your words to tell her you didn't like it so she had the chance to put it back in the fridge for later. I feel like you inadvertantly hurt her feelings even worse by getting caught chucking it out instead of simply telling her you didn't like it.  \n\nWasting food - especially in this economy - is a shitty thing to do, but I don't think that alone makes you an asshole. Your intentions sounded pure.\n\nSounds like you two have it sorted out if she has agreed to just prepare it that way for herself in the future.\n\nEDIT: fat fingered typo", "Even nonsweetened regular almond milk tastes vanillaish in mac and cheese!  Ew.", "YTA for not being honest. That mac and cheese sounds awful, but you can tell your partner you don't like something (politely). Otherwise they'll make it again thinking you like it.", "ESH, you for lying and wasting food and your GF for getting upset at you for refusing to eat the food in question. However, nothing wrong with not eating food you don't like, you tried it and didn't like it. Next time, just diplomatically state that it doesn't work for your taste buds and make yourself something else.", "YTA for wasting the food. If you didn't like it, fine, but don't throw out your entire portion. Just use your words, tell her you don't like it, and eat aomething else.", "YTA for wasting for food and not telling her you didn\u2019t like it.\n\nShe may have made it again for you if she didn\u2019t find it.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be mean, but it\u2019s ok to say, thank you for making this, I appreciate the effort. The flavors aren\u2019t for me, I\u2019ll put this aside so you can have leftovers.

Make sure to throw something on top, that she wont touch if something like this happens again.", "My spouse made me scrambled eggs - yay! - and actually used sweetened vanilla almond milk  - boo!

I mean I can understand using soy milk in a pinch, but vanilla flavoured milk? No bueno. That's a serious crime.\n\nAnd yes, you should have covered your tracks better as mentioned. Layering is your ally when it comes to disposal of the evidence.", "NTA That sounds disgusting. Did she realize she was using vanilla flavored milk or was it an accident?", "NTA that does sound awful. You were a trooper to try a bite, but after that no thank you.

Of course in some households that might cause even more suspicion", "Best advice.\n\nNTA - I\u2019ve made Mac n cheese and only had sweetened vanilla almond milk and can attest to how disgusting it is. I ended up not eating the Mac n cheese.", "And don't overdo it by exclaiming how good the food is, or you may find she starts cooking it often just for you. My ex did this with a dish his cousin makes that he hates. He eats it though, and compliments her cooking. One day I thought I'd put him out of his misery and kindly told his cousin (in private) that he hates that dish. She laughed and said she knows but she'll keep making it for him every time he visits until he decides to be honest and just tell her he doesn't like it. I suspect he's never told her and that she still makes it for him 20 years later.", "I think he was being sneaky solely to save her feelings. And if she makes Mac n cheese like that normally she\u2019s unhinged.", "No. She made that choice on purpose even though there was regular milk in the fridge.
