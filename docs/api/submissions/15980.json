Some time later, I found a fig stuck between the table and the wall. Something I would expect of a 5 yr old.", "If you can't be honest in a relationship, why bother?\n\nThe \"fight\" started because of a lie. If it's because he can't be honest, the relationship is really over anyway.\n\nRoot cause analysis.", "All of the yuck on that!", "Because, way back in those olden days, I had more heart than I had sense. I assure you I have learned much in the interim. :p", "We had a cat that did this for me. Usually it was hamburger that I couldn\u2019t chew.", "That\u2019s teamwork", "Yep I did it years ago in mashed potatoes. Didn\u2019t even cross my mind that it was sweetened until I took a bite and then threw the whole nasty thing away lol", "I don't use milk in my Kraft M & C because I often didn't have any or it had gone bad. I use water and a little extra butter and it's fine.\n\nSweet M & C sounds disgusting. That's not being picky, that's just bad cooking. Did she eat it all? NTA", "My mom used to do shit like this\u2026.she was not much of a cook, but once in awhile she\u2019d make something super low effort but then throw some weird shit in/on top of it and she was convinced that this made it \u201cgourmet\u201d or something. And she\u2019d get really bitter if someone didn\u2019t like it. Sometimes it just not worth the fight and the attitude for days if you said no thanks but some of that shit was straight up gross and not worth choking down. I spit a lot of food into napkins growing up.", "100% agreed", "on a smaller scale, it's a waste of food because OP's girlfriend likes them and could've eaten them for another meal, instead of opening/buying other ingredients to make another meal. idk anything about them, but for an average or low income household, the smaller stuff makes a difference.", "Good! Because no offense intended but that is not edible and I'm surprised you didn't promptly return it .......... \ud83e\udd22\ud83d\ude02", "Lmao. She says \"sweet and savory\" go together well. Idel what to say. Just keep it away from me lol\n\n\n\nShe also criticized me for liking peanut butter bread on the side with my chili like that's the same thing", "Did you really just ask if an indigenous family in the Andes had a greyhound? \ud83d\ude10", "I saw an episode of Three\u2019s Company like that once. Just once, though. They usually talk it out in all the other episodes.", "Pasta water is my secret ingredient for so many sauces.", "This is the whey", "They don\u2019t go hand in hand in this case. She literally called him picky.", "When even the dog refuses, you know it\u2019s bad lol. Anything left on my plate the cat tries to finish. He had broccoli, carrots and potato in his dish the other day", "Reminds me of a video clip I once saw of a cat walking up to someone's coffee, sniffing it, and then kicking its back leg like it was burying a poo.", "Reminds me of my mom's first attempt at microwaving potatoes. My dad got them out of the microwave and threw them in the sink, they were shooting flames out of them. Good times.", "My cat Mowgli loved green beans too!\u2764\ufe0f", "I had a cat named Clark Billdale Broccoli. He loved broccoli...thing is, so did I. I always hooked him up though.", "I was wondering the exact same thing. Peas on the floor sounds like the likely scenario\u2026that is not very covert.", "Napkin under plate, peas on napkin, slide out with a butchers thumb with one hand so it drags napkin onto cupped hand that flattens to hold plate bottom as it comes off the table. \n\nI mean, that\u2019s how I would do it\u2026", "I don't care about stupid Maslow. To me watching a pet starve is worse than watching myself starve.", "Sorry but if my pet is starving so am I. They were having dinner. That means there's food for the dog even if u have to eat less.", "I use whipping cream \ud83d\ude01", "i\u2019m sorry but powdered milk \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22", "She dug it up too soon. Everyone knows porkchops take more than a week to ripen.", "The thing is, this dog was truly omnivorous. He ate anything. Couple days after finding the chops, he was licking himself down there, and my mom called him down. I told her to leave him alone. He was just trying to get that taste out of his mouth.", "We had a chihuahua who LOVED raw cabbage. Anytime we were having a dish requiring it, she'd sit in the kitchen and stare you down til you caved.\n\n\n\nEdit, bad grammar", "I like them because they\u2019re salty lol", "Wait...what is the smoke alarm for then?! Asking for.. a friend..", "How else would you know the garlic bread is done?", "The running joke at our house was that everyone knew when it was finished cooking hamburgers bc I always set of the smoke alarms in the apartment.  Lol", "That was a Far Side strip, right? I feellike I knew someone in the early '90s with a shirt or a calendar with that on it.", "Ok, the dog will lick himself, but he won't eat your sandwich. What does that tell you, Joey?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "If you don't have an air fryer the broiler works. I could eat them every day.", "Canned corn is the only canned vegetable I\u2019ll eat", "If you don\u2019t like frozen, try fresh veggies. They\u2019re super simple to cook, especially if you use a steamer basket. Just steam them for a few minutes till they\u2019re hot, add a little butter, and serve.", "It\u2019s to tell you when to light another joint \ud83d\ude09", "We grew up with canned veggies too, I'm ND and have pretty intense texture issues - but man oh man canned peas with meatloaf and mashed potatoes are my absolute most favorite comfort meal.\n\nAny other veg I prefer fresh or frozen, but there's just something about canned peas that hit me differently."]}
