My younger sister (34) is also single and lives in the same community as me. She helped me immensely last year when I left an abusive relationship. I love her and want her in my life. But we've been fighting for the last 3 months about a guy...\n\nLast summer, we both spotted a very handsome man at a community event. He was new to town and unknown to each of us. Neither of us approached him, just ogled him from afar. Neither of us made any attempt to meet him or any plans to find out who he is. At the end of the community event, we never talked about him again. \n\nFast forward to the fall, and I'm at open mic night at a favorite bar. And guess who I see! The handsome man from this summer! I made no moves to talk to him or anything. He approached me and asked to take me out on a date. I was nervous and flattered that he wanted to take me out on a date. We ended up going for a walk with my dog to get to know each other. Turns out we're very compatible and super attracted to each other. \n\nI was hesitant to say anything to my sister about him as she had already kiboshed another potential dating interest because she liked him for a while and asked that I not go on a date with him (after this guy left a sweet note on my car asking if I was single and meet him for coffee because I smiled and said hi at him while feeding the parking meter). I never dated this guy, and things didn't work out for my sister with him either.\n\nI eventually told my sister that I met the handsome man from the summer, went on a date with him and that we really clicked. She was very upset that I went on a date with him. She felt that I should have \"wing-manned\" for her and introduced them so she could date him. I'm of the opinion that he was interested in me, asked me for a date, so it would have been weird to connect him with my sister instead. \n\nShould I have presented my sister's interests before my own in regards to dating the handsome man from the summer? Her and I have talked a little about this and I think there's more to it than just siblings rivalry in the dating world. The conversation between us stalled out and now we're silent treatment stalemates. She's interverted and has a hard time meeting new people. I'm more outgoing and find making new friends relatively easy. \n\nTL;DR My sister is upset that I didn't ask her about dating the handsome man from the summer before I went out with him. She believes that \"girl-code\" should have prevented me from dating him, because she was interested in him. I've checked with my girlfriends and none of them see the issue. It's a small town, there's bound to be overlapping interests. But as long as you aren't actively pursuing someone that your friends are dating, there no issue.

It is his, too. He is a full-grown adult who is capable of making his own decisions, and he should have a say in regard to his feelings for you. If it really comes to it, get him to talk to your sister and explain that he likes you, not her, and wants to be with you, not her.\n\nIf the fact that she helped you financially is such a big deal to her, start saving and pay her the money back.

And now that I've had some time to heal and am open to dating again, we hit this snag. This is all so juvenile, and probably would have already happened while we were in highs school, except that we were never single at the same time in our younger years, so this type of fight never happened in our teens.
