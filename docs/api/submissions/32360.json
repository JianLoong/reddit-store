My younger sister (34) is also single and lives in the same community as me. She helped me immensely last year when I left an abusive relationship. I love her and want her in my life. But we've been fighting for the last 3 months about a guy...\n\nLast summer, we both spotted a very handsome man at a community event. He was new to town and unknown to each of us. Neither of us approached him, just ogled him from afar. Neither of us made any attempt to meet him or any plans to find out who he is. At the end of the community event, we never talked about him again. \n\nFast forward to the fall, and I'm at open mic night at a favorite bar. And guess who I see! The handsome man from this summer! I made no moves to talk to him or anything. He approached me and asked to take me out on a date. I was nervous and flattered that he wanted to take me out on a date. We ended up going for a walk with my dog to get to know each other. Turns out we're very compatible and super attracted to each other. \n\nI was hesitant to say anything to my sister about him as she had already kiboshed another potential dating interest because she liked him for a while and asked that I not go on a date with him (after this guy left a sweet note on my car asking if I was single and meet him for coffee because I smiled and said hi at him while feeding the parking meter). I never dated this guy, and things didn't work out for my sister with him either.\n\nI eventually told my sister that I met the handsome man from the summer, went on a date with him and that we really clicked. She was very upset that I went on a date with him. She felt that I should have \"wing-manned\" for her and introduced them so she could date him. I'm of the opinion that he was interested in me, asked me for a date, so it would have been weird to connect him with my sister instead. \n\nShould I have presented my sister's interests before my own in regards to dating the handsome man from the summer? Her and I have talked a little about this and I think there's more to it than just siblings rivalry in the dating world. The conversation between us stalled out and now we're silent treatment stalemates. She's interverted and has a hard time meeting new people. I'm more outgoing and find making new friends relatively easy. \n\nTL;DR My sister is upset that I didn't ask her about dating the handsome man from the summer before I went out with him. She believes that \"girl-code\" should have prevented me from dating him, because she was interested in him. I've checked with my girlfriends and none of them see the issue. It's a small town, there's bound to be overlapping interests. But as long as you aren't actively pursuing someone that your friends are dating, there no issue.

It is his, too. He is a full-grown adult who is capable of making his own decisions, and he should have a say in regard to his feelings for you.

Not saying the way she seemingly views love interests is good or anything of that sort, but maybe she does not understand how much you care about her. I'm saying this bc I know how it feels to be thinking that my care for someone is unrequited or that they do not care about me in the same level that I care about them, and it does hurt whether the care was never there or got lost in translation. I'm thinking maybe the amount you care for your sister is lost in translation, as in your sister cannot understand that you deeply care about her (I assume) and that you will do anything that will help her out of bad situations, probably with the exception of if that will harm you or another innocent person. So maybe there is a way to get it across to her, but in your situation I would just say \"hey I know you're not gonna respond to this, but I care about you deeply and would do anything to get you out of a bad situation so long as it doesn't hurt me or any innocent person. I also would like to know why you feel this way about me dating this new guy so that I can try to understand what your views of Girl code are, and wish to express what mine are so that you can understand my point of view. I will always be here for you, whenever you are ready to talk and whenever you need me\" and then just move on with your life while keeping the door open for your sister.", "NTA - does this dude care that ur a single mom?", "Your sister is 34, no 14.

You didn't initiate contact, you let the guy make the first move with the person he's interested in.\n\nNTA, and I hope your sister realised how silly it is to think all single men in your area should be automatically reserved for her.

Your sister should be cheering you on that you get a shot with mr.handsome. Instead she\u2019s being a jelly B, foul on your sis. \n(*if girl code does exist this is the play, you are clear for dating mr.handsome, your sister needs to show support and be happy for you.)", "This is so fourth grade I'm embarassed for both of you.", "NTA. That\u2019s weird.", "NTA all she did was say that he was handsome at the same time that you did. She never expressed an interest in the mystery man afterwards. That\u2019s just weird that she wouldn\u2019t want her older sister, who was in an abusive relationship, to find someone who makes her happy and instead wants you to turn down every attractive man that shows an interest in you and recommend her instead \ud83d\ude02 genuinely this is just so confusing", "Your sister is irrational and living in a make believe world.   \nYou both spotted a cute guy while you were out together. As fate would have it, you happened to cross his path again and he was interested.   \nWhere does this even hint that she has a claim on his attention?   \nNTA. Your sister needs help.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a spoiled brat who's used to getting everything she wants no matter who she tramples.", "NTA.\n\nSo question, did she say that she liked him and wanted to pursue him ACTIVELY (or asked you to go up to him that day and put a good word for her because she's too shy) that summer you guys oogled him? My interpretation was that you two pointed him out to each other, giggled like schoolgirls, and then went about your fun community event.\n\nI think the fact that that was not really established, the \"girl code\" does not apply here.", "NTA. Your sister is unhinged. This guy sought you out, how are supposed to be her wing woman??? Is she used to always getting her way? She needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nHe approached you not her. He wanted to get to know you not her. Girl code is for ex boyfriends and high-school crushes not adult dating scenarios. Tell her to grow up and that when a guy likes her she will know cause he'll come to her. As a single mom you shouldn't put your opportunities on hold cause of your sister as it's hard as a single woman but when you add even 1 kid it's 1000x worse for us. It took me 4 years of being a single mom with no partner to find a bf so yeah keep the guy and tell sister to move on", "Her girl code seems to be that she gets first dibs, and you don't. NTA and enjoy your own love life whatever she says about it.", "NTA - It would be different if this was a guy she already knew well and really liked but he\u2019s just guy you both saw in a bar once and you were lucky enough to meet again.\n\nHe\u2019s a living, breathing man who chooses his own potential partners, you can\u2019t just give him away to someone like a Christmas present. You not seeing him doesn\u2019t mean he is going to be interested in dating her.", "NTA.\n\nYou should watch the movie Love Serenade though\u2026", "How is it that your sister is 34 and still a high school freshman?\n\nBecause that's exactly what her nonsense sounds like.\n\nNTA.", "Girl code over 20 is no (wo)man territory, unless we speak about recent, or terrible, exs, fucking husbands/boyfriends or close relatives without permission. All the rest is free game.", "Maybe op will have this boyfriend and then sister can have every other man in town because op is taken!", "Nah, he's pretty cool with it!", "Can I ask why her \u201cgirl code\u201d trumps your \u201cgirl code\u201d? Like why doesn\u2019t she give you the same courtesy? Why is it okay for her to date someone you have a crush on, but it\u2019s not okay for you to do that?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me but I kinda got the feeling your sister is intentionally going after guys that you like.", "\"The obvious solution would be to cut him in half and they each get a bit.\"\n\nWhat this is not an obvious solution at all, you wouldn't do it with pizza why would you even consider doing it to a person. You never cut pizza slices (in half or any other smaller size) from their restaurant default or initial oven cut. It is all or nothing, the person that calls dibs eats the whole slice or nothing.", "NTA obviously but given the multilayered context your sister is very introverted, in a small town, single af and you are the gregarious, outgoing, meet anybody type person. Can you date who you want? Of course you can. Do you need to date people your sister is crushing on you Mankiller you? Maybe not. You can easily move on and she cannot. I\u2019d think about breaking up with your sister to be honest but realistically if it is easy for me to meet people then none guy is like any other and I could pass on this one.", "People expect other people to be like they are. Your sister is the perfect example of this by accusing you of the behavior she exhibits.  I'm so sorry you are going through this. Do yourself a favor and allow yourself to be happy and enjoy dating the new man who asked you out.", "sisters shouldn't cock block then. Ur clear to smash!!!!", "Sister isn't specifically going after guys OP likes, she just wants dibs on everyone in town.", "It's like The Judgement of Solomon, but with even higher stakes.", "Then the sister should've pursued him."]}
