Him treating women this way is not due to his autism, it's learned behaviour that your parents have taught him.\n\nAnd it is sexist.", "NTA. Being on the spectrum is not an excuse to be rude, sexist, and a know-all. A 24yr old man running to his parents to complain about what their sister said also shows his immaturity. Better he hears it from someone who actually cares about him than someone who lands a punch.", "NTA. As an autistic person: your spectrum might be an explanation/excuse for being accidentally insensitive sometimes, but it cannot be a free pass to be a dick and then blame it on everybody else.", "NTA\n\nYou were just being honest and he\u2019s having trouble accepting it", "People shouldn\u2019t be asking questions they don\u2019t want honest answers to.

It's simply ASD now, and people are just somewhere on the spectrum. \n\nThis is because people like your mom would think those classified as high functioning were \"special,\" and it led to a lot of attitudes like your brother has. \n\nJust because someone has intelligence in one area (or a few), it doesn't make them any better than anyone else. Your brother has been fed a lie that is now coming back to bite him in the behind, but that's not your fault. \n\nIf the guy can't take some honest feedback about his attitude towards women, then he shouldn't be dating in the first place. \n\nThis has nothing to do with his autism. My kids are 9 & 11 (both have ASD), and I constantly get compliments from strangers about how kind and considerate they are to others. My youngest even spoke about how he has romantic feelings for a girl in his class (he could differentiate between platonic and romantic as we have spoken about different kinds of love in the past), but won't do anything about it because he doesn't want to make her feel uncomfortable or ruin their friendship.  He's nine!\n\n2nd - Your mother has raised a misogynist.  It's on her that he can't interact normally with women, so maybe ask her how she would feel if your bf (or partner) had thr same views your brother does and treated you that way. \n\nBy her definition, he's \"high functioning,\" so there is no excuse for him to not understand that he is being sexist and derogatory.  She is simply making excuses.", "He asked for your opinion and you answered tactfully, then he complained about being attacked simply because he didn't like your opinion.\n\nDon't ask for an opinion if you don't want to receive one.\n\nNTA", "NTA - He asked your honest opinion, you gave him your honest opinion.

He needs to wake the fuck up. The parents made him more autistic and less socially able to function that he would've been able to without their stupidity.", "Yeah you are not the arsehole.   \n\n\nSpeaking as a  man on the spectrum, it is dangerously easy to let that processes of fixation convince you that emotions are the problem, but really, it is not that they are the problem, but that men are often socially conditioned to be somewhat obtuse to their emotions, especially by the sort of upbringing your mum seems to have encouraged on him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is important than anyone with an ASD have some measure of engagement with emotional sensitivity training as these will be the areas that cause the most frequent struggles. I sometimes wonder if the Western Fixation on STEM has made these problems more acute.", "NTA. Your mom has serious issues tho.

Your parents didn't really set him up for success and the real world. It's a shame, for his sake, but it has nothing to do with you.\n\nIdeally he'd be going to therapy to work on those issues, but I doubt that would happen with your parents around", "NTA.\nThe dating world will ruin any confidence he has if he doesn't get this under control. You're doing him a solid by trying to point out where he's going wrong.\nAutism isn't an excuse to be an asshole, and your parents blowing smoke up his ass isn't going to help matters. \n\nIf he wants a girlfriend, he has to be someone that girls want as a boyfriend. Being demeaning, assuming he knows *everything* and using honesty as a flimsy disguise for off-colour remarks isn't what anyone wants as a boyfriend.\n\nI'd say he's much less an AH than your mother though. She's effectively hobbled him socially and it will have long-lasting consequences.", "NYA in any way, you answered his question. Guys who act this way need someone to tell them what they\u2019re doing/thinking isn\u2019t okay and to stop blaming women for their dating woes. If he is never told any of this, it will get worse and he\u2019ll just get more incel-ish.

And I bet it felt good to unload !", "Info: did you repost this from your own account? I remember reading something that was exactly this (same quotes, language, problem). Additionally it\u2019s cut off at the bottom, like it copied over incorrectly.", "Truth is always hard. Move on you got a hard point across.", "NTA. He asked, you answered. Sometimes the truth is painful. He should learn from what you said.", "NTA\n\nYour parents loves him and has supported him..  but they've clearly done a bad job preparing him fir interaction with others...  \n\n>I\u2019m just being honest and you can\u2019t accept it.\n\nPerhaps tell him this??\n\n>especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people.\n\n...and that ppl - including women - rarely respond well to this...", "yeah the sane ppl are always the ones getting in hot water if the point out flaws, faults or hypocrisy.

The truth is, you can't handle the truth!\"", "NTA. He wasn\u2019t \u201cattacked over things he can\u2019t control\u201d. Aspergers/autism is never an excuse for bad behavior, and his (lack of) respect for others is completely within his control. \n\nIt\u2019s not just your brother who needs to be told the truth though - your parents need to hear harsh truths as  well. Do they really want their son to be alienated and alone all his life? Because they won\u2019t live forever, and then he will be left alone and incapable of building meaningful and fulfilling relationships.", "NTA His running to mommy when someone crosses him isn't attractive either. You might tell him that, too.", "I would simply tell him 'you are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I\u2019m just being honest and you can\u2019t accept it.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin his confidence you ruined his false confidence.  Sounds like your mother\u2019s approach to parenting was the exact opposite of how professional therapists for autism would recommend. \n\nMany autistic people have alexithymia and it looks like rather than naming emotions and calling out your brother when he misjudged someone else\u2019s emotional state your mom just reinforced his ego.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand why your brother use terms like \"illogical\", there is a phenomenon that occurred with me and basically every asperger/Autistic that i have known until now, there is the part of life that humans become more \"rational\" (In my experience, most people experience this on the early teens), autistics, Since our brains aren't that great in understanding social clues, implicit norms in general and sometimes How to manage our feelings, they tend to overthink and overanalyse everything with logic (basically, the person turn into L from Death Note), from this It comes stuff like \"your actions aren't logical\".\n\nThe problem is that this is nothing more than overthinking. Human actions aren't only decided by logic reasoning about the circunstances, emoticon and instinto are Just as, If not more relevant than that in human behavior. Since the Autistic brain can have some difficulty in understanding that, we use to focus way too much in the logical aspect, Which is bad... because It can't really explain everything about human interaction, sometimes we can't really express something, we \"Just know\"\n\nSome people learn to kinda grow out of this with time, Which makes them more sociable um the long term, and there is people that don't learn How to get out of this crap, Which seems to be your brother's case.\nHe needs to \"let It out more\", instead of thinking about the moment, he needs to feel It, live It. I know, i know... sounds like some generic catchphrase from a cheap live lesson movie, but it's true. Is more of a \"Just know\" knowledge than something \"teachable\", but the overall message is this.\n\nUntil he stops seeing people as \"analysable\" and \"illogical\", he will keep failing in dating and basically everything else with social interaction.\n\nI'm not claiming that he will become some social chameleon with 2637 different social skills and become a pro on It If he stops with that limiting thoughts, speaking by myself, i'm still pretty much socially inept. But i can guarantee that i've become WAY better in everything involving social life after i started with the \"live the moment ideology\".\n\nSay this to him, being on the Spectrum isn't a excuse for being a asshole.", "NTA.

Parents and other adult authority figures often excuse the bad behavior of their young charges by blaming it on the disorder they have.", "It\u2019s fairly common for people (sometimes parents, sometimes school admins) to excuse poor behavior from people with various disorders. I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if the post a year ago was from someone else in more or less the same scenario.", "That\u2019s not his sister\u2019s responsibility. If she wants to that\u2019s fine, but she should not be obligated to be his teacher.", "I've read this word for word before,  a couple times now.", "OPs claims on his account to be a 15 year old guy who likes football.", "The fact that it's cut off mid sentence at the bottom without an edit to fix it was the giveaway for me.", "Probably not.

I abhor being illogical/irrational/unfair; it can actually be painful.\n\nFunnily enough, I've been called such my whole, but it's usually just bc of my vagina lol\n\nI mean, I probably wouldn't have immediately reacted great, but when left to think about it for a bit, it would definitely get the wheels turning. \n\nI do lean towards the overly empathetic traits on the spectrum though, which doesn't seem to be the case with this guy, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "https://time.com/5255779/asperger-syndrome-nazi-germany-history/", "Yes it does have Nazi ties to it.

So imo not really that perfect, just petty. \n\nNTA. Someone needed to tell him. From the way you tell the story I surmise that the way you said it might have had some festering frustration from all those years. Not the best way to go about it, but understandable. I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been. If anyone though, it\u2019s your parents that deserved that frustration, your brother much less.", "That\u2019s still not why the diagnosis was removed.  The entire field of psychology is full of terribly uncomfortable facts/origins.  It takes more than that to remove a diagnosis entirely, namely a sound theoretical reason and evidence in support. \n\nThat said, as a psychologist I\u2019m surprised I hadn\u2019t heard about this before today.

Broadly, it is now agreed that what was referred to as Asperger syndrome is part of the autism spectrum and there is no need for a separate term.\u201d", "It\u2019s not downplaying to say that isn\u2019t why the name was changed - it\u2019s factually correct. The person saying that is why it was changed is wrong. The reason for the change was clearly stated, and it\u2019s not that.", "That\u2019s not why the diagnosis was changed.

Your parents coddled him at everyone else\u2019s expense, but now he\u2019s paying the price. I don\u2019t understand why parents want to keep their kids down. You should want all of your children to be as self sufficient as possible, and maintaining healthy relationships with siblings and partners is a huge part of this.
