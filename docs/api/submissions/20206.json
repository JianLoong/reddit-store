Just crazy way of thinking", "False.", "hi, OP's SIL! the baby wasn't taking the bottle. the baby was easily breastfed. the baby wanted her mother's goddamn boob. feeding a baby is more than a reasonable reason.", "Because as I stated before I had attempted to bottle feed but my baby rejected it. It was in my diaper bag. She has been pushing me to bottle feed so she could take her to \u201cgive me a break\u201d. \ud83e\udd14", "Because I have been advised that when my SIL is mad to not try to talk to her or she gets more upset. Apparently this is a normal thing in the family as she gets offended or upset by others and then if they try to make amends she just flies off more. My MIL says that SIL\u2019s got mad at her and cut her off for months at a time before.", "Oh gods. Ok in that case keep her tf away from your baby. This has all the ingredients to turn into a kidnapping case or some shit. SILs got trauma around losing a baby and is showing signs of inappropriate attachment to your baby, and her mother seems to be enabling and supporting her in that. That's genuinely scary.", "Sounds like her \"cutting you off\" is a win/win for everyone!!!", "My guess is that she saw your baby rejecting the bottle from you and decided to try to give it to baby hoping that she\u2019d succeed. She wanted to prove that she\u2019d be better mother than you. Or that you cannot handle the baby properly but she can.", "Please for your babies sake keep her as FAR AWAY from your child as possible if she had a miscarriage and is that upset and eager to be with YOUR child even when you want them back, she seriously needs mental help to get her through that, not to take someone\u2019s baby from them", "Just notice these things:  \n\\-SIL saying, that you, moving out of state, are taking the baby away and she won't know her (it hit me, even before I've  read what you wrote further)   \n\\- SIL lying to you, that baby is eating (baby was screaming of hunger) and implying, that YOU are the problem and are incompetent around the baby, that she \"knows better\"  \n\\- SIL twisting the whole situation on social media, making you \"the bad and unreasonable person\".   \nYes, keep your baby faaar away from this disturbed woman.  \nNTA, of course."]}
