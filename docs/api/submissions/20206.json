My sister-in-law was already emotional because we are leaving state and she\u2019s upset about it and was crying about how our 5 month old baby will not get to know her, which isn\u2019t true because we planned on visiting frequently.  My husband and I stepped outside and she and her mother went to her mothers room with the baby. My sister-in-law was trying to force our baby to take a bottle but she is breast-fed and has been rejecting the bottle even though I was previously trying to get her to take it. When my husband and I came back inside I heard the baby crying so I walked to the bedroom. She immediately looked frustrated that we came in the bedroom because she said that the baby was taking the bottle until she heard me start talking. My mother-in-law then said maybe the baby needs a diaper change so I walked to the other room to get a diaper and some wipes. When I returned, she was shoo-ing me away and telling me to leave that she\u2019s got it. She then continued to try to get my baby to take the bottle, and my baby was screaming. I then asked her more sternly can I have my baby back so that I could feed her and she said that the baby is eating and I told her no I\u2019m talking about breast-feeding my baby that\u2019s what she wants. She then made a face and was like OK take the baby. I took the baby to the other room because I could literally feel the tension. After I took the baby out of the room, she left the house and told my husband that she stepped on my toes apparently and then she would talk to me later. Ever since then she won\u2019t even talk to us and even after I told my husband to tell her that I was sorry that I got frustrated she is now on Facebook posting things about cutting toxic family members off.
