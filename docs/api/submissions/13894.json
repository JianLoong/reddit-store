This is a tough one because I understand autism can be quite debilitating. Here\u2019s the thing though: handicapped spaces are intended specifically for those who have physical disabilities that require a) ease of access and b) the shortest distance to travel and c) need to be able to unload/load a wheelchair from a vehicle. \n\nMy brother had cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and was wheelchair bound. We had 0 choices for parking our handicap van that had a side-loading wheelchair lift. It specifically needed the handicap space in order for him to get in and out of the van. He loved going out with us, but sometime we literally couldn\u2019t get him out because all of the handicapped spaces were full. Please keep this type of situation in mind. \n\nAll that said, I\u2019m going to say NTA. Autism is a spectrum, and you don\u2019t have to justify the severity of yours.

I don\u2019t know your situation, as every case of autism is different, but I personally haven\u2019t seen anyone who suffers from just autism (not a second disability alongside it) who needs either of those things.
