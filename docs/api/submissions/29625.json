Dad and her mom lost custody of her when she was a baby and she went into the system. I was 7 at the time and my parents had divorced after dad got her mom pregnant with her. Neither shaped up enough to take her back and none of her bio relatives wanted her, at least the ones that were approached. Dad was estranged from his family so no idea if they actually heard from anyone related to CPS back then. My mom was approached and told the social worker she would not take my half sister. She told me about my half sister and her being in foster care and let me know that one day my half sister might want contact with me.\n\nThe day came and I was like you know what, if she has questions I will try to answer them and we'll see what happens. She was very enthusiastic to have me in her life and came on very strong. I set some boundaries and she pushed on them a lot until I let her know that she was at risk for losing contact with me again.\n\nShe backed off and we started getting to know each other like the strangers we were. A few times she asked about my life and my childhood and my mom. One thing she focused a lot on was whether my mom had other kids. When I was 13 mom took in my cousins, her niece and nephew, after their parents died. My sister was always so weird about that and recently brought it back up again and wanted to know what I thought about that and whether mom needed time to consider it. I told her that wasn't really something we needed to talk about. She went off saying of course it was. She called my mom a bitch and said she let her go into the foster system to rot and separating us when a few years later she could take on two kids just because they were related to her. She started saying my mom owed her better than that seeing as she's my sister.\n\nI lost my shit with my half sister and told her my mom owed her nothing. I said she was not my mom's kid and my mom would not have been the right person to raise her since she was born from dad's affair and she should be looking at her bio relatives to be mad at if she really wants to blame people for letting her go into foster care.\n\nMy half sister said she has every right to feel like my mom failed her and should have stepped up. She said she was a baby and she went through hell her entire childhood in the system. She told me I was an ass for yelling at her and an even bigger one for defending my mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698227166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g128r/aita_for_losing_my_shit_with_my_half_sister_after/", "score": 2422, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My reasons for doing that might not be good ones given my half sister isn't even 20 yet and she really doesn't have anyone else in her corner. She has no family in her life and I was mad at her and I likely made her feel abandoned again because I did not speak to her with more compassion. I also probably showed her how much I don't care that mom didn't raise her with me. That's something she clearly holds onto as a \"would have been better\" option. Overall, she's still a kid in many ways and had a rough life so I feel like my response was too much.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It always breaks my heart when someone comes through a crappy experience like this with such a confused and angry view of who owes them what. \n\nI mean, I can kiiiiind of understand your sisters mindset because she can blame her parents all she wants till she\u2019s blue in the face but they didn\u2019t step up and probably never will.

Her sperm donor's  relatives should have stepped up.", "NTA\n\nYour half sister has a lot to deal and come to terms with, but she was never ever your mother's responsibility.", "NTA. I feel sorry for her though. Sounds like the system fucked her up. She should direct that anger at your dad and her mom. A million percent. \nGod I hate shitty parents.", "NTA and I'm surprised your Mum was ever asked to take your half sister. She wasn't a bio relative, and smbolsed what would have been a very painful time for your Mum. If your half sister wants to blame someone for not taking her in she should be looking at her parents and her bio relatives.", "NTA, yes she was a child, but she wasn\u2019t your mother\u2019s child.

It is sad that your sister went to foster care, but not your mother's fault. Jesus, I can't even begin to imagine raising the child from a partner's affair, the shear gall of asking in the first place is horrendous to me. Your sister very likely went through hell, I would probably give her a slight pass on the hurt feelings, but she seems to be taking it too far, and your defense of your mom is spot on. I wouldn't necessarily suggest that this interaction alone would justify no contact, but hold your ground on this. Your sister is absolutely blaming the wrong person here. Good luck to both of you.", "NTA. Taking in cousins is a very different matter from taking in your ex\u2019s affair baby. I can understand your half sister being sad about it - it has to feel like \u2018why them and not me\u2019 but she needs to grow up, realise the answer to that question is obvious, and stop acting like either you or your mother owe her a damn thing. Personally I\u2019d cut her off.", "NTA. Good on you for standing up for your mother.", "NTA. Cut contact with her. You don't need her attempting to guilt you or your mom about anything.", "NTA. the system sucks fucking ass but she sounds so bratty. u are right completely, she is not your mothers kid so theres absolutely NO obligated to owe her anything, especially as shes the result of an affair", "NTA & it's time to sever ties! Your mom owes your dad's affair child absolutely nothing & she's having misplaced anger issues! She's mad at another persons mom who has no obligation or relationship or responsibility to her when her own bio parents were the ones that failed her. It's never going to be a peaceful relationship and it's best you let it go right now. You both have different life views and she's going to resent you and act on hers as she sees herself as the abandoned party!", "NTA at all. You are defending the parent who raised you against a wrongful attack. I understand this person is your half sister but you don't owe her anything either. So if she persists, you can cut off contact. You can feel badly for the way she had to be raised, but you don't have to have a relationship if she refuses to stay within the boundaries you set.", "NTA It\u2019s sad because the poor thing is desperate for a family, but she needs to get a hold of her anger if she ever wants to be a part of your life. As of right now I took a break for the holidays and let her know the reason why.", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nHowever going through the care system can make people become very disturbed individuals, who can also make up tales and hate on other people to help them get through what they have been through.\n\nIf I was you I would cool off this relationship until your sister has some time to do the work on herself.

Why did she stay in foster care?", "NTA, OP, but please consider this: Just as you are entitled to your feelings and opinions, so is your half sister. She has genuine grievances about being abandoned, and it's likely she's lashing out at the one person whose actually in her life that she feels could have done something about it. No, your mom doesn't owe this girl anything, but the two of you still share blood. And if I were in this girl's place I'd probably feel rejected all over again.", "NAH - i can see where she is coming from, suffering and longing for a better life can do you dirty, especially if you had absolutely 0 influence on the situation.\n\nbut op is right, its not her moms fault or responsibility to take care of a constant reminder that her husband cheated. but OP, you could show some more compassion..", "YTA.

Our emotions aren't treated as valid. We are not thought of as people by a lot of portion of society. We are seen as defective. No one wanted us. The foster system is hard and a lot of abuse happens. Foster kids are more likely to be mentally ill, have addiction issues and this all stems from not being wanted and other trauma. \n\nAt 18 you age out and you are angry. The system breeds anger.

She will lash out and it's understandable. When she does disengage. Do not attack. Walk away, turn off notifications from her texts. Just don't respond for a while. Tell her that her anger is misguided when she has cooled off. That you will not deal with anger because you were a child and your mother was in a hard situation and had to make a hard choice. Tell her you will not take disrespect from her about your family.\n\nShe has a lot of people she is probably angry at. I am very angry at my bio family but I am old enough know to not lash out at them. She isn't angry at you perse but angry at the whole situation. She had no one.

If anything, she should be directing her vitriol at her own mother and your father, not at the woman who was cheated on. NTA, and honestly, I think you need to go very low or no contact with this person.", "NTA. Her parents might owe her. not you or your mom. But if you want to pursue a family like relationship with her, then maybe try sibling/family therapy with her(and she probably needs therapy), but IDK, that's just my opinion.", "My mom was asked too about my dad second affair baby that\u2019s 6 months younger than me. She actually thought about it because of me but eventually said no and someone on her mom side eventually took her in. I honestly think my life had been more hell than it already was if my mom had taken in my sister cause my sister is an absolute idiot that ruins everything she touches. So NTA", "NTA. I think you should just go NC. That girl just wants to leach.", "Just know that this is just talk that doesn\u2019t actually hurt you.  This girl was abandoned.  No one loved her.  Naturally she has a huge chip on her shoulder and is directing it at the only possibly stable person who could conceivably have offered her a better life.  Your mom it\u2019s the best of the bunch.  Everyone else totally sucks.  Is it any wonder she would dream that her life could have been better if only?  I get that your mom is not the bad guy here and def doesn\u2019t owe this girl a thing.  Just be gentle.  That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.  Be gentle.", "NTA how the fuck is she your mom\u2019s responsibility?? Why is she not mad at her boo family and your fucking dad?? Her ACTUAL parent. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s blaming your mom when she didn\u2019t give birth to her. She needs to start actually seeing the picture clearly or stop talking to you", "NTA. Her situation sucks but it wasn't your mom burden to bare...and it's not yours either. If you want to be an ear for her, great but I'd make it known that your mother nor you owe her anything. It seems like she's gearing up to make you and, by extension, your mom her emotional punching bags just bc you're probably the only one that cares enough to listen. I'd suggest therapy and more boundaries.", "NTA - She is being ridiculous . ..  however she is still hurting from her life of being rejected. She's mad at everybody. She isn't mature enough to understand that vehemently attacking your mom, or you, doesn't solve anything, but makes it worse. If I was your mom I wouldn't take in an affair child either, because I couldn't love that child . . . and one would hope that someone else could give that child love. That, sadly, didn't happen for your half sister. Of course she is jealous of the love that was showered on you and your cousins by blood and how it was not given to her . . . but as I said, she lacks maturity. She will be sorry if she loses you too. People suffer from being rejected as a baby, small child . . or youth and for some people they become bitter their whole lives and thus their lives are ruined completely. It's horrible to be in that position . . . but not everyone is to blame . . . and since they still have life, they need to learn to make the best of it.", "NTA\n\nYour cousins are related to your mom. HS is not. Harsh but true.", "I like agree with you, about the topic at hand, but the majority of poor people aren't mad at rich people because \"you have extra monry, so it's only fair to give your extra money to me,\" but because their profit is made off their exploitation. \n\n\nUnless you're talking about fantasizing about being rich? Which would be different. Like I just want afford medical care, groceries, and rent, that'd be so nice", "If she is blaming OP\u2019s mom then she needs to also blame every other adult in the area at the time.

Ops mom is not related and is just a reminder of her husband\u2019s infidelity. She wasn\u2019t capable of taking her in.", "Nope. Her mom didn\u2019t fail OP\u2019s half sister any more than any random person in the area did. To fail her she would have to have a responsibility to her, which she did not.", "So not taking in your husband's affair baby means that you haven't grown up yet? Roger That.", "Wrong. Not wanting to raise your ex\u2019s affair baby doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t an adult. It means you are mature enough to know your own limits.", "that was my thought, tell sis' that her mom owes YOU for breaking up your happy family because she couldn't keep her legs together and see how that goes over.", "What foster child needs a daily reminder that nobody cares about them?", "Exactly this", "It wasn\u2019t meant to mean all poor people.", "You're not relational sisters, just share a father.  There's no loss if you never see her again", "She wasn't the one breaking their marriage vows...", "You're trying to conflate two entirely different things, which is pointless and has no bearing on the real situation. Of course it sucks that the half-sister grew up in foster care, unloved and without family. However, that is in no way OP's mom's fault. That blame solely lies with her parents and the rest of the bio family that refused to take her in. \n\nExpecting that OP's mom would willingly take in her ex's affair child is a step too far and not something the vast majority of people would be willing to do. Even if she had decided to take the girl in, there is zero guarantee that she would've grown up in a loving environment. There's a much higher chance that OP's mom would never be able to see her as anything other than a product of her ex's affair and not treated her that well, which could easily end up being more damaging for the poor girl in the long run.", "There\u2019s also the one where the wronged wife divorced her husband because she was having seriously dark intrusive thoughts about the affair baby and recognized that she needed to get out.", "Yeah foster care sucks but as a baby she at least had a chance of getting adopted rather than ending up like that one", "Funny how both posts are posted only 4 hours apart and each by a user profile that started today", "OP mentions her coming on too strong and not respecting boundaries until she was told it risked ending contact, so it\u2019s not one argument. It\u2019s a repeated pattern involving someone with a poor grasp of acceptable social behavior. Which, to be fair, certainly wasn\u2019t modeled for her by her deadbeat parents and probably wasn\u2019t in foster care either. Which, as is often the case, is a reason but not an excuse. OP isn\u2019t obligated to tolerate abuse by someone whose misfortune is not remotely her fault. \n\nIf stepsis could acknowledge the consequences she was risking the first time, she can be told again, but I\u2019d call this a last strike situation", "Ah, okay. It may not be the best comparison, but I understand.", "Imagine the life OP\u2019s mom would have had having to see her ex\u2019s affair baby every day. Imagine the life OP would have had seeing her mom dealing with that.", "That didn\u2019t make her part of the mother\u2019s family.", "I don\u2019t think the child\u2019s life should have been thrown to hell.

You don't sleep with them.", "Blah blah blah, an adult woman being reminded of her husband's infidelity is worse (according to u/creditupstairs7621) than an innocent child going through life in the system, perhaps with no one that actually cares about them.\n\nWould you mind, terribly, elaborating to me why you think the feelings of the adult are more important than the feelings of the abandoned child, ESPECIALLY since that child IS RELATED TO HER OTHER CHILDREN, AND THEREFORE, IS *ENTITLED* TO THE CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW THEIR SIBLINGS!!\n\nI mean, seriously, how fucking HEARTLESS can you motherfuckers be?\n\nEdit: funny how I see downvotes on my post, but I don't see a single, actual, answer to my question :)", "That one still haunts me. So pleased OP recognised the thoughts being wrong at least!", "I feel like telling her that would imply she should go confront OP\u2019s mom, because who else would the \u201cright person\u201d be to talk to about it?", "In disagree.", "The best interest of the child is to be adopted out to stable parents.", "I agree that the bio parents should have done that, but they didn\u2019t, and the kid needed *someone* to give a shit she was there.", "Again, the two things are not related in any way no matter how much you want to pretend they are.
