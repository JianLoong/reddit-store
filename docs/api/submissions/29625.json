Dad and her mom lost custody of her when she was a baby and she went into the system. I was 7 at the time and my parents had divorced after dad got her mom pregnant with her. Neither shaped up enough to take her back and none of her bio relatives wanted her, at least the ones that were approached. Dad was estranged from his family so no idea if they actually heard from anyone related to CPS back then. My mom was approached and told the social worker she would not take my half sister. She told me about my half sister and her being in foster care and let me know that one day my half sister might want contact with me.\n\nThe day came and I was like you know what, if she has questions I will try to answer them and we'll see what happens. She was very enthusiastic to have me in her life and came on very strong. I set some boundaries and she pushed on them a lot until I let her know that she was at risk for losing contact with me again.\n\nShe backed off and we started getting to know each other like the strangers we were. A few times she asked about my life and my childhood and my mom. One thing she focused a lot on was whether my mom had other kids. When I was 13 mom took in my cousins, her niece and nephew, after their parents died. My sister was always so weird about that and recently brought it back up again and wanted to know what I thought about that and whether mom needed time to consider it. I told her that wasn't really something we needed to talk about. She went off saying of course it was. She called my mom a bitch and said she let her go into the foster system to rot and separating us when a few years later she could take on two kids just because they were related to her. She started saying my mom owed her better than that seeing as she's my sister.\n\nI lost my shit with my half sister and told her my mom owed her nothing. I said she was not my mom's kid and my mom would not have been the right person to raise her since she was born from dad's affair and she should be looking at her bio relatives to be mad at if she really wants to blame people for letting her go into foster care.\n\nMy half sister said she has every right to feel like my mom failed her and should have stepped up. She said she was a baby and she went through hell her entire childhood in the system. She told me I was an ass for yelling at her and an even bigger one for defending my mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698227166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g128r/aita_for_losing_my_shit_with_my_half_sister_after/", "score": 298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My reasons for doing that might not be good ones given my half sister isn't even 20 yet and she really doesn't have anyone else in her corner. She has no family in her life and I was mad at her and I likely made her feel abandoned again because I did not speak to her with more compassion. I also probably showed her how much I don't care that mom didn't raise her with me. That's something she clearly holds onto as a \"would have been better\" option. Overall, she's still a kid in many ways and had a rough life so I feel like my response was too much.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It always breaks my heart when someone comes through a crappy experience like this with such a confused and angry view of who owes them what. \n\nI mean, I can kiiiiind of understand your sisters mindset because she can blame her parents all she wants till she\u2019s blue in the face but they didn\u2019t step up and probably never will. Your mom did for you. She\u2019s envious, but kind of in the way a poor person decides they have a right to a rich person\u2019s stuff because \u201ccome on, you have so much! Just give me some.\u201d  It\u2019s bitter, misplaced anger.", "NTA - I feel for your half sister but your mom owed her nothing.  Her sperm donor's  relatives should have stepped up.", "NTA\n\nYour half sister has a lot to deal and come to terms with, but she was never ever your mother's responsibility.", "NTA. I feel sorry for her though. Sounds like the system fucked her up. She should direct that anger at your dad and her mom. A million percent. \nGod I hate shitty parents.", "NTA and I'm surprised your Mum was ever asked to take your half sister. She wasn't a bio relative, and smbolsed what would have been a very painful time for your Mum. If your half sister wants to blame someone for not taking her in she should be looking at her parents and her bio relatives.", "NTA, yes she was a child, but she wasn\u2019t your mother\u2019s child. By her logic every adult that lived at the time is to blame", "she would be right if she were your half sister on your moms side. but she is not, so she is wrong\n\nNTA", "NTA but you need to ask yourself if youre willing to put up with this behavior for the rest of your life. Do you feel like having to constantly defend your mom, who was a single mom asked to take in an infant, or fighting to keep reasonable bpundaries.", "NTA she blames the wrong Person", "NTA. \nHer rage is misplaced for sure but I'm sure she had terrible time in the system, her resentment while misplaced is understandable.", "And what genius told her your mom didn\u2019t want her. She should never ever have been told that. In her mind it\u2019s probably just rejection on top of rejection. Not that what she said was okay. I just empathize with her.", "NTA\n\nI would write/email/message your half-sister that while her experience in the care system was unfortunate, it wasn\u2019t your mum\u2019s responsibility to bare. Explain you feel it would be better for your sister to access therapy to help her process her childhood in care and that you feel any continued contact with her until she accesses the needed therapy, would only compromise her mental health further.", "NTA. It is sad that your sister went to foster care, but not your mother's fault. Jesus, I can't even begin to imagine raising the child from a partner's affair, the shear gall of asking in the first place is horrendous to me. Your sister very likely went through hell, I would probably give her a slight pass on the hurt feelings, but she seems to be taking it too far, and your defense of your mom is spot on. I wouldn't necessarily suggest that this interaction alone would justify no contact, but hold your ground on this. Your sister is absolutely blaming the wrong person here. Good luck to both of you.", "NTA. Taking in cousins is a very different matter from taking in your ex\u2019s affair baby. I can understand your half sister being sad about it - it has to feel like \u2018why them and not me\u2019 but she needs to grow up, realise the answer to that question is obvious, and stop acting like either you or your mother owe her a damn thing. Personally I\u2019d cut her off.", "NTA. Good on you for standing up for your mother.", "NTA. Cut contact with her. You don't need her attempting to guilt you or your mom about anything.", "NTA. the system sucks fucking ass but she sounds so bratty. u are right completely, she is not your mothers kid so theres absolutely NO obligated to owe her anything, especially as shes the result of an affair", "NTA & it's time to sever ties! Your mom owes your dad's affair child absolutely nothing & she's having misplaced anger issues! She's mad at another persons mom who has no obligation or relationship or responsibility to her when her own bio parents were the ones that failed her. It's never going to be a peaceful relationship and it's best you let it go right now. You both have different life views and she's going to resent you and act on hers as she sees herself as the abandoned party!", "NTA at all. You are defending the parent who raised you against a wrongful attack. I understand this person is your half sister but you don't owe her anything either. So if she persists, you can cut off contact. You can feel badly for the way she had to be raised, but you don't have to have a relationship if she refuses to stay within the boundaries you set.", "NTA It\u2019s sad because the poor thing is desperate for a family, but she needs to get a hold of her anger if she ever wants to be a part of your life. As of right now I took a break for the holidays and let her know the reason why.", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nHowever going through the care system can make people become very disturbed individuals, who can also make up tales and hate on other people to help them get through what they have been through.\n\nIf I was you I would cool off this relationship until your sister has some time to do the work on herself. Anything that happened to her is her dad and mum\u2019s fault nothing to do with you or your mother.", "NTA\n\nShe don't need a dna test to her parents....", "Nta", "The only AH here are, dad and stepmom. I think your half sister is a lost child who hasn't had any love. You and your mum are NTA OP.", "NTA...but your half sister was not treated well by her biological family. She is grasping at straws looking to find someone to connect to and your mom seems the most responsible in her circle. Your mom had no obligation to her. \n\nIt's a pity your sister was not adopted. Why did she stay in foster care?", "NTA, OP, but please consider this: Just as you are entitled to your feelings and opinions, so is your half sister. She has genuine grievances about being abandoned, and it's likely she's lashing out at the one person whose actually in her life that she feels could have done something about it. No, your mom doesn't owe this girl anything, but the two of you still share blood. And if I were in this girl's place I'd probably feel rejected all over again.", "NAH - i can see where she is coming from, suffering and longing for a better life can do you dirty, especially if you had absolutely 0 influence on the situation.\n\nbut op is right, its not her moms fault or responsibility to take care of a constant reminder that her husband cheated. but OP, you could show some more compassion..", "YTA.
