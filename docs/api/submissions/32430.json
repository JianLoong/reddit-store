That's not just entitled, that's bizarre. Even if they WERE responsible pet owners, why on earth would you be obliged to give them one of your aquariums? Who does that? Who goes to the neighbors to insist on taking their stuff??\n\nNTA.", "NTA. They're your fish. That's pretty much the end of it. What's yours is yours. If the kid wanted a car, would they expect you to hand Iverson the keys? \n\nStores exist.", "Nta but really you are the asshole in the most satisfying way possible.  Good for you!!! That was very satisfying to read that you told those horrible people off.  How many bunnies and chickens need to die before people knock it the eff off", "NTA.\n\nOkay, so of course you're not the asshole for refusing them on the basis that you can see they're animal abusers.\n\nBut leave that aside.  Let's go back to the fact that these are just people in your neighborhood, they aren't your friends, you don't LIKE them or respect them (for good reason), and... they're just walking up to you and saying, \"hey, give us several hundred (dollars, pounds, whichever) worth of aquarium equipment and fish for free\"?\n\nWHY.  Why would they even think you would just give this stuff to them? \n\nI can guess, I suppose.  Because you have more than one aquarium, so you don't \"need\" all of them; that's a common excuse with people like this.  Because they don't actually understand how much these things cost (but they clearly  understand enough to know that they don't want to pay for even the most basic starter set themselves, appropriate for an 8 year old and parents who have no intention of really helping take care of any pets they bring into the house).\n\nBut good god, what basis do they have to INSIST on this?  For real?  What gives them the gall to come back the next day and demand again?\n\nWhat you told them was the truth, and you're not an asshole for that.  Especially not for saying it to them when they'd exhausted your patience and refused to take no for an answer.\n\nBut really, you could just end it at, \"No, I'm not giving you $600 worth of equipment and fish for free\" -- or more!  I don't know, I just know it's expensive, and if that estimate is overselling it, that's fine; whatever gets the point across to them that they are asking a relative stranger for an insane amount of money based on no social connection or social obligation whatsoever.   The kid doesn't NEED a set-up like that, and can't handle it, nor can the parents.  If they want to get him fish, they can start with the cheapest starter stuff. \n\nIt's insane that they're demanding all of this from you.   It would frankly be insane even if they were good friends of yours, or even relatives.  Would they walk into your house and demand you give the kid your computer?  Would they demand you give them your car?  I don't know, they sound unhinged, maybe they would.  But your answer doesn't even have to be \"no, because you'd break it\".  Your answer just has to be, \"No, are you kidding, why would I ever give you something that costs that much, and which is mine?\"", "I keep aquariums too and people don\u2019t realize how expensive they are and the maintenance they take. NTA, it\u2019s a labor of love and I would hate to \u2018give up\u2019 one of my tanks for free and to people I don\u2019t trust.", "Why would your neighbors think you were a pet store just because you have aquariums?\n\nNTA", "NTA. I can't stand parents like that", "NTA. I had a roommate who loved his fish and saw firsthand how much work can go into setting up and maintaining a healthy aquarium. Especially when a hurricane blows through Florida, knocking out the power for a week and leaving the filter system inoperable. Almost no 8-year-old alive is going to have the discipline to devote that kind of upkeep.", "I mean, if the shoe fits...\n\nYou didn't say anything that wasn't true, and screw little Timmy.

I don\u2019t know I cannot fathom walking to a neighbor\u2019s house and ask for free stuff!!", "NTA, the parents can go to the store and buy a starter kit. They aren't that expensive, I bought one for my kid.  I ended up taking care of the fish myself as he is irresponsible. After a few years the fish died and I put the tank in the basement. He wanted another one, nope not till you prove to me that you are responsible as I won't let the fish suffer cause it's too much work to take care of it. It's the same thing with the dog my kid and wife wanted. I mainly take care of it and she is always next to me and follows me.", "Parents that won\u2019t properly raise their kid should not get a pet for the kid, let alone one at all. \u2018I\u2019ve done so well at not raising my kid, I should let them have a pet\u2019. \n\nYou were right to let the kid come over if he wants even one fish, because he should know what it takes to raise and take care of them.

You can have whatever reasons you need to deny them that.
