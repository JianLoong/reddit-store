You properly shut her down.", "NTA - even without the lockdown weight, you NEVER comment on a new moms weight. Super rude.", "NTA She obviously knew that you'd recently given birth, and commenting on a new mum's body is an asshole move. Especially as she was using your body to make herself feel better.", "NTA\n\nThat's rude. Imagine telling her all these years at your every meet up, that \"Look, I'm still the smaller one.\" I bet she would not appreaciate it.

She should be glad you didn't say anything hurtful.", "NTA (Not the Asshole)\n\nYour friend was being insensitive and rude by continuously bringing up your weight and comparing it to hers. It's understandable that you reached your breaking point and told her to stop. You have every right to set boundaries and express that you don't want to discuss such a sensitive topic. Her reaction of feeling uncomfortable and distant afterwards seems like a bit of an overreaction on her part. She should respect your feelings and understand that her comments were hurtful.", "Definitely NTA. It seems like she could be insecure about her own weight and is taking it out on you to make herself feel better. Sorry OP, I would have snapped too.", "NTA - not even remotely- she was rude and cruel.  Even if you hadn\u2019t given birth recently, and your weight gain was entirely Oreo-based, she was rude and mean.  This wasn\u2019t a conversation out of love about noticing a change in your health and eating habits, this was just a cruel celebration of someone else\u2019s issues because she\u2019s unhappy with herself.  \n\nI say you drop a couple hundred pounds of bad friend, cuddle your baby and take care of yourself in whatever way works for you, even if it\u2019s Oreos!\n\nEdit - grammar", "NTA!\n\nIts never ok to comment on anyones body if it wasnt explicitly asked for.", "~~I N F O~~\n\n~~Is weight something that came up a lot when you were younger?~~\n\n~~In the middle of the post, you say she's \"fatter than ever\" and you're \"just a bit bigger\", which is completely opposed to \"she was never fat but always a bit chubby and I was thin\".

She's rude to keep bringing up your sizes, but since she's an old/close friend, you should have just said \"please let's not discuss this, I'm not feeling great in my body these days and don't want to talk about my weight.\" Snapping at her when all you'd previously done was smile and change the subject is a bit sharp.", "NTA\n\nIf you want to stay friends there are more tactful words than 'shut up' to use but no, you aren't the asshole for not wanting to sit at a social engagement being dragged for your appearance.", "NTA\nShe should not talk about your body unless she is telling you that you look great as that might be hard for you but do not tell her about what you said in your post about her being fatter than ever", "INFO\n\nThis makes no sense...\n\nThis starts with \"She was chubby, I was thin\".

Your friend sounds like an insecure person who\u2019s taking it all out on you. She\u2019s being extremely rude, and you expressed to her you wanted her to stop. Sounds like you need to reevaluate this friendship, OP.", "She obviously has been envious of you in the past and now that you aren't skinny she was finally able to feel better about herself by putting you down, perhaps a better way to handle it would've been, not snap at her but ask her to stop talking about it in a calm and direct method, tell her you aren't pleased with your weight and the constant talking about it is making you angry. \n\nTo repair the relationship,  send her a message,  apologizing for your snapping at her, and explain your feelings about your weight, if you are good friends she should understand.", "As the big friend in a group of athletes I can understand her perspective, but talking about someone\u2019s weight gain is not cool.

I maybe could have presented it in a nicer way but I was getting frustrated.", "She\u2019s always been a bit insecure about her weight so I usually give her a bit of leeway with these things.

I was quite thin but flabby because sport wasn\u2019t my thing but I sort of got a free pass from others because she was bigger than me. I think she always resented that and now I\u2019m the big one is rubbing it in my face.", "To be fair, they are thinner than me now but that isn\u2019t from them losing weight themselves.

She was nice for the beginning but a bit thrown off when I snapped at her as it was quite out of character. If I want to continue this friendship I need to make it clear to her that the topic of weight is basically off limits.", "I was never skinny but I would certainly be considered quite thin in the past. She\u2019s always been a bit insecure about her weight and her mood can change very quickly. Generally, I leave it a day or 2 and contact her when she\u2019s calmed down. I think I shocked her by snapping at her since it was a bit out of character.", "She has been insecure about her weight in the past so this seems most likely.", "I\u2019m pretty overweight but not obese or anything. Last time I weighed myself I was 5\u201d4 and 173 pounds. I\u2019m not convinced I need a wake op call though. I know I visit the ice cream a bit too often but I\u2019ve just given birth. I\u2019ve just accepted I\u2019m gonna be tired and fat for a while.", "I wouldn't blame you, if you said that to her, but you are obviously good person and you care about your friends. Good for you, that you stopped her and didn't let her put you down. You are not there to boost her ego. Her being bigger the whole time it's not free pass to talk down on you. How would she like that if you did the same thing? \n\nIt's very obvious, that she is extremely insecure about her weight. That's why she shouldn't do something she would HATE herself. If she likes to bring weight topic so much, then she should be prepared to face the truth about herself too. \n\nDon't let her treat you like the bad guy. I would ask her, how would she feel meeting after giving birth (or just gaining weight or you hitting gym) and you CONSTANTLY commenting, that her body is bigger than yours. I don't think she would take it so well. Why does she think it is okay for her to do that?", "I\u2019m glad you let her know it\u2019s not ok.  And if she won\u2019t spend time with you because you said it\u2019s not ok to make comments then that says more about her than anything else.", "Got it, adjusted my answer!", "Fair enough :)\n\nIn that case NTA.", "Well you can't help what others do or say. As long as you weren't the one that was pointing it out, or making a \"big deal\" about being the thinner friend back then.\n\nNTA - You might could have phrased it a bit better to her but really you weren't in the wrong. Having been on the receiving end of people discussing her weight one would think she should know that it's not cool to bring up someone's weight. And she didn't just mention it once she kept on about it. She's a bit of a AH for possibly not wanting to meet up again just because you asked her to quit talking about your weight.", "So you are fat. By the sounds of it she wants to help you. You may not think you need a wake up call but you\u2019ve got fat and don\u2019t want to do anything about it. She was being a good friend looking out for your health and you snapped back at her because you\u2019re too lazy to lose weight. YTA", "She can go into these sort of strops. I\u2019ll leave it a couple of days and then contact her and try to make up again."]}
