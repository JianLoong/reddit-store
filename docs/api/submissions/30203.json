Food with no meat is vegetarian, but it's not vegan if it contains any animal products. Yet you say it's not for the \"vegetarian/vegan section.\" There should not be a single section for both foods at these potlucks. They need to be separate.

The worst that could have happened if you informed your coworker that your food wasn't vegan was for them to tell you that they actually aren't. Instead you just let them eat it because of a - in this case - fairly nonsensical principle. Would you not have warned a colleague with a nut allergy of food containing nuts?

I thought the difference between plant based and vegan was one is a diet and one is a lifestyle (vegans can't wear leather or wool, use beauty products with animal products etc ). However I can't find that being referenced anywhere, I think it's just in my mind.\n\nIf you've never said you're plant based then NTA but I still think you should have mentioned it to your coworker when you first saw her eating something. Especially if she had not eaten most of it already and/or the meat in the dish was obvious. Something other than a sauce or broth that people can stay blissfully ignorant of if they accidentally eat and never discover.\n\nI will say as a vegetarian myself, I would be mad for a couple of days.

Like I know tons of vegetarians that are ok eating eggs or only eggs from a farm them know or their own chicken but would never consider fish sauce to be acceptable. Many vegetarians are extremely uncomfortable with fish sauce because it is essentially liquid animal carcasses. And if Parmesan isn't labeled veg, the use of rennet from cow stomachs is a no go.
