That's probably a talk you are going to want to revisit.\n\nRather than uninviting him to Christmas, which won't achieve anything, you should have a talk with your daughter about safe sex (including consent, STI/STD prevention, and birth control). You want to make sure that she knows that she can say \"no\" at anytime, to anything, and instill the self-confidence to do so, and to create an environment where she feels like she can come to you or another trusted adult if she feels pressured or something else is off.

Allow them to be engaged. But stipulate they have to wait until she is 18 or later to get married. Offer to help with the wedding but not until she is done with college (assuming she is going). If it is real love then it will last- a lifetime- if it is not it will naturally burn itself out. \n\nDefinitely have that conversation about birth control. Pronto. And also talk to her about using condoms as well as the pill. Make sure she understands the dangers of the pill (and how it might mess with her mental health). Get her to understand there are no \u201cfree\u201d options and sex can, no matter the controls, potentially lead to babies. \n\nMake sure she always has you to come to.

Sex is pretty normal at 16. \n\nMarriage is not. \n\nYou have gone way overboard and now your daughter will simply lie to you", "NTA him getting a 16 year old lingerie is seriously gross.  The sad thing is that you're not going to help success in keeping them apart. They will find ways around it.  I would definitely object to their relationship altogether at this point.", "I sympathise with your concerns about their engagement (although they probably consider themselves engaged no matter what you say). When we were 17 and dumb my then-boyfriend and I got engaged; It did not end well. Although at about the same age my grandparents got engaged, and they've just celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary, so you never know.\n\nAlso, remember when we were young? My parents disapproval was definitely an attractive trait in a partner. \n\nThat aside, you've not told us anything that makes me concerned for your daughter. My interpretation is that this is primarily your hangups about sex, and about your daughter having it. So I'm leaning YTA. \n\nI assume you already realise that your daughter and her boyfriend are sexually active. So what's the issue with the lingerie? It's hardly extreme, much less dangerous, and there's no reason why that shouldn't be a part of a healthy sex life. If they're both happy, which by your own account it sounds like they are, then there's no cause for concern. \n\nAn alternative way of looking at it is this: would you rather they carried on where you at least have some supervision and influence from you, or would you rather their relationship separated them from you? \n\nSo it boils down to do you want their relationship to continue safely, surrounded by your daughters family, or do you want to reject them and have it continue anyway? The latter is precisely what you're doing right now, and unless you start digging up pronto you'll just find your relationship with your daughter severely damaged as you push her further into her boyfriend's arms.", "YTA -ISH While I can understand (and agree with) you putting the kibosh on the proposal, I don't think that uninviting this guy from Christmas was the right call. If your goal is to protect your daughter your best course of action is to keep the guy right under your nose. Invite him to Christmas dinner and then invite him to dinner at your house every night until either your daughter (potentially) realizes that he's not the one for her or YOU realize that he's not that bad - just an overzealous young dude in love.", "YTA. She is too young to be engaged but do you really think freaking out and banning him, sex, etc is going to do anything productive? You just showed her that she can\u2019t be honest with you and that instead of talking to her you\u2019d rather just lay down the law. Surely you know how this will go with teenagers", "Does she say she loves him ? Or is this just being excited ? Let her know that you take her feelings seriously and that you are her advocate. I\u2019d talk with them both. Set some ground rules . If you two want to be considered  a couple in the eyes of the family , then you need to be respectful of it . Likewise we will be respectful of your relationship. He can be invited to participate in family functions , and is welcome in the home .( not her bedroom ). Giving a teenage girl gifts for a mature woman is disrespectful  to her and our family. Show us that you are a young man worthy of her admiration  and of our trust . Have the sex talk . Have the education/ vocation talk .Where do they see themselves in one year, five years ? How are they planning for this blissful fate of forever love? Engagement at this age is premature , they can\u2019t even support themselves . \nI met my husband at 15, he was 17. We have grandkids now, I take young love seriously. Good luck Mama, you\u2019ve got this .", "YTA. Excluding Mateo from your family will achieve the opposite of what you want. You need to have a proper sit down with him, especially if his home life is that bad he's probably not aware that marriage isn't the best idea that early on. Sex at 16 isn't uncommon. From now on it'll just be unsafer sex due to your decision.", "Tiny bit YTA -teens fuck, it happens. Now is the perfect time to have a sex positive conversation and go over using protection for both the teens. It\u2019s better to keep him closer then alienate your daughter because what if for example he starts abusing her or something ? You\u2019ll never know bc she is now going to hide everything. \n\nI would reach out and just say you want to meet with both of them and try to have a calm conversation. Invite him back to Christmas if you can.\n\nEDIT -I do 100% agree with canceling the proposal -that was a bit wild and you\u2019re in no way the asshole for that.", "Uninviting him isn\u2019t the best approach. Clearly these two shouldn\u2019t be engaged or plan a marriage yet. \n\nWhether or not sex between them is legal (here it would be), definitely discuss adequate birth control with her. Hormones will trump the law. \n\nNTA.", "Ummmm, in terms of the lingerie, if you're in the U.S., you might want to check and see if it's legal for 18 year olds to sleep with 16 year olds in your state. And then you might want to share what you find out with Matteo if it's a no.\n\nIn many states, that's statutory rape, which is taken pretty seriously.\n\nAn 18 year old proposing to a 16 year old is and giving her lingerie a problem.

You obviously didn't have a problem with them dating, even though they've probably *been having sex,* and idk where you are, but a 16 year old doesn't need Mommy's permission to have sex. \n\nThe best thing you can do now is let them be together and hope for the best. Buy her birth control. That kind of thing.\n\nShe's old enough that if she was to move out of your house and in with him, most judges wouldn't even hear your case and would let her stay with him and his family.\n\nI don't believe that you went in her room to put laundry away. 16 year olds typically put their own laundry away. Shame on you for snooping through her things.\n\nThe only way to fix this is to allow them to be together on Christmas. You are honestly on a fast track to lose your daughter if she's already planning on marrying the guy. You won't stop her.", "NTA\n\n16 is young as hell for a situation like this", "Mateo and Cindy need a briefing on statutory rape.", "NTA.

The best way to show your parents how you feel about something you dislike them doing is to do exactly what you have been forbid to do, and do it so they are probably going to find out. Twofold win there, excitement of possibly being caught & if you are caught being able to flaunt that parents couldn\u2019t do anything to stop you. \n\nNow here is where I\u2019m probably going to get attacked- teens are walking globs of hormones. The sexy 12 days of Christmas, were given by two of these teen globs who just thought it was a good idea to get engaged to be married!

I had the same boyfriend through all of high school, and then after hs I dated a different guy for a few years. She was so mean to them both and sooo strict with me about them. \n\nIt\u2019s normal for teenagers to be having relationships and even sex at 16.
