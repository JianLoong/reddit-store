When we were 17 and dumb my then-boyfriend and I got engaged; It did not end well. Although at about the same age my grandparents got engaged, and they've just celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary, so you never know.\n\nAlso, remember when we were young? My parents disapproval was definitely an attractive trait in a partner. \n\nThat aside, you've not told us anything that makes me concerned for your daughter. My interpretation is that this is primarily your hangups about sex, and about your daughter having it.

It's hardly extreme, much less dangerous, and there's no reason why that shouldn't be a part of a healthy sex life. If they're both happy, which by your own account it sounds like they are, then there's no cause for concern. \n\nAn alternative way of looking at it is this: would you rather they carried on where you at least have some supervision and influence from you, or would you rather their relationship separated them from you? \n\nSo it boils down to do you want their relationship to continue safely, surrounded by your daughters family, or do you want to reject them and have it continue anyway?

These next few years could be the last you hear and see from her before she decides to cut you out of her life; depending on how you decide to drive that wedge.", "I get why you\u2019re not thrilled. But you can\u2019t just act like your daughter is a little girl and throw punishments at things that you don\u2019t like. The real answer is a serious discussion with your daughter and possibly Matteo about a lot of things, including safe sex. \n\nI don\u2019t get what anybody gets out of banning him from Christmas. Trying to force them apart is just going to push it underground and backfire.", "My husbands brother and his girlfriend (both 18 at the time) wanted to get married. Husbands parents said for them to wait as they were young. Guess what happened, she got pregnant a month later. You are naive to think the same wont happen here. Get her protection and either you or someone she trusts needs to explain why she should not have a child this young. Good luck.", "lol wow \n\n$100 says she's pregnant within 6 months", "This is not a good idea. You push to hard and you\u2019ll just push them further together. You\u2019ll end up a young grandparent.", "The more you try to pull them apart the closer they will become.", "Yta, dude she's the age of consent, if he was 19 or 20  i would completely understand, however, it is her body and her choice, but nta if you get her put on BC and ask her to wait a while until she gets married, also, being engaged doesn't mean she's going to get pregnant", "NTA\n\nshe's a minor and he's an adult - major red flag.\n\nbesides that, he's love-bombing her and she's most definitely too innocent to realise.", "NTA - OP your daughter definitely should see a doctor before she ends up pregnant. Here's the thing, her boyfriend is acting like a typical 18 yr. old, and she is acting like a doting 16 yr. old. If you try and keep them apart, it will only get worse. The thing is, is let her have her ring and treat it like it's a promise ring as others have suggested. Sit them down and have a serious talk with them about being responsible and letting Mateo know right from the beginning that your daughter has to be an adult and graduated high school before she can get married and that he needs to show he can be a responsible provider for her. Understand that a lot can happen in two years, and she could end up wanting something else for her life or he could find someone else or decide he wants to enjoy his life without marriage or kids for a while. At 16 she really doesn't know what she wants but time can do wonderous things, so be gentle but let her know that you expect her to make smart decisions and that you need to be able to trust her. As her father, she really doesn't want to disappoint you. Make sure that a doctor is willing to give her the shot for birth control that lasts the longest, so that nothing unexpected happens before she has matured enough. If you talk to her about what she wants to become as an adult, try and find ways of providing some type of experience for her, like if she wants to become a veterinarian, see if the local vet would allow her to job shadow them for a day during surgeries to observe; this could get her mind focused on something other than getting married right off. I'm not saying it could work 100%, but anything is better than nothing.", "NTA. Tell Mateo to stop Giddeying around.", "NTA but everyone here is right. You are better served keeping them close so you can watch her and his behavior.\n\nAlso get that birth control. NTA", "YTA for uninviting him. Your daughter is either having sex already or is  planning to do so soon and that's going to happen whether he is at christmas dinner or not. Take your daughter to get birth control and not the pill. She needs something that cannot be tampered with: depo-shot, arm implant, or if her Dr thinks shes a good candidate an IUD. If her and this teenage boy want to get married so bad, they might try and plan a pregnancy. Shes needs birth control that she cant \"accidentally\" forget to take or \"accidentally\" forget to use a condom 1 time. Theres no point in telling her not to see him or not to date him, she would just do that behind your back.", "YTA. No idea why everyone is saying she's \"too young\" to wear lingerie / have sex. She's 16! OP overreacted big time and is just going to make their daughter be sneakier, not smarter.", "NTA: while 18 and 16 is only 2 years there is such a maturity difference. we\u2019re talking about someone who just started driving by herself vs someone who should be going to college/trade school in the next year. the proposal is scary, she\u2019s a child, unless she has permission from a parent/guardian she wouldn\u2019t even be able to marry him until she\u2019s an adult. you can\u2019t forbid her from seeing him (it\u2019ll only drive up the desire) but i think you need to speak with her in a calm, kind way and just talk about your concerns with her dating him. be vulnerable with her, she might be feeling similar feelings of being rushed into this relationship. your daughter needs help, in a few years she\u2019ll look back and wonder why she let this happen to her. be there for her, be her safe space, but you also need to set very very firm boundaries with her AND him.", "YTA for going through your daughters belongings. It is a shitty move. I still, at 59, get utterly pissed if my mom gets into my stuff for any reason. It's intrusive, indicates controlling and disrespectful behavior and it'll kill your relationship with your daughter.\n\nNTA for setting limits, although I think it will be effective only at pushing them to elope. I agree with the recommendations for birth control, and an industrial sized box of condoms in the stocking this year.", "Okay my question is how long have they been together? Cause if it's like three months I can understand this reaction more, but if it's two years then let the lingerie/sex thing go. Yeah don't let her get engaged and married at 16 but also actually listen to your daughter and hear why she thinks its a good idea. Getting mad at her is just going to make her sneakier and not trust you. You need her to be open with you, trusting her and giving her the space to do that is so much more beneficial than punishing her for being a silly teenager. (Also get her on birth control) ESH", "NTA. But What did you think a 18yr old male wanted with a 16yr old female? Bible study pal?", "He was still invited after the proposal? The gifts are what made you uninvited him? Did you seriously believe that they weren\u2019t having sex if they were planning to get married?  YTA.", "NTA. Both Cindy and Mateo are way too young to get married. Gross. The thing is, as annoying as it is, you can\u2019t stop them from having sex may be some sort of long acting reversible birth control? Some thing like the shot or an IUD, or the arm implant, that cannot be accidentally forgotten.", "Don't just TALK about birth control!! Get her the Depo shot immediately!!   And the HPV vaccine, because 18 year old boys are seldom faithful.", "May I suggest you get her a hormonal birth control implant.  it will last 3-5 years, depending on the type, and she can't forget to take it or use the condom incorrectly (still should be using a condom though).  It's your best chance to not have an infant in your house soon.", "This is the most logical response I\u2019ve seen. OP definitely went overboard in how she handled it", "Talk about birth control at the family Xmas dinner. And STDs. And getting tested for them. And orgasms, and sexual satisfaction for both partners.", "This boy needs to be put on birth control as well not just her daughter!! He also needs to act responsibly here not just the daughter and he NEEDS TO BE TOLD that by the parent", "THIS SHOULD BE AT THE TOP.", "It\u2019s a 2 year age gap, Chris Hansen. Chill.", "Talks are definitely going to stop sperm from reaching the egg \ud83e\udee1", "My best friend had her daughter two weeks after she turned 17. She was using condoms, however the condom broke and she was not on any form of birth control as a backup. Take her to a doctor so she can start birth control as soon as possible.", "Oh problem solved then", "I\u2019m sure you have had talk about not getting married till she is an adult. Look how far that has gotten her. You\u2019re NTA but don\u2019t be naive.", "Yeah but birth control WITH condoms >>> just condoms especially for inexperienced teens.", "Ahhh.... absolutely not. I was 8 when I got mine. And my Nana's doctor said it was extremely rare to get at 8", "I was 10 when I got my first period. There was absolutely no reason to mess with my hormones for no reason at 10 years old.", "Noooooooooooo it\u2019s actually not recomendddd to start birth control just because they got their period. There should be a reason (sexually active, irregular periods, acne , etc). Not just because they started menstruating. Omg.", "SO many high school couples \u201cget engaged\u201d and how many of them last? Not very many. Let\u2019s ban this boy from our house and forbid her from being his finance? You just created a Romeo and Juliette scenario. We know how that one ended.", "Yeah I agree, the engagement is too far but as long as they\u2019re using protection I don\u2019t see why the underwear as a gift is a problem. Many people I know received gifts like that from boyfriends when they were in school and none ended up as teen parents", "At 18, I\u2019d agree with you. But at 16 the parent DOES have the power to put an ***effective*** wedge in a relationship like this. The boy WILL move on if he can\u2019t contact or see her. \n\nI\u2019d rather my daughter be mad at me for a couple years and NOT end up married/pregnant than ignore it and have her end up married and a teen mom.", "OP isn't Matteo's parent and has no control over what Matteo does. Of course he should be wearing birth control and of course his parents should be talking to him as well in a perfect world. All she can do is care for her own daughter and help prepare her the best she can.", "What male birth control would you recommend he be \u201cput on\u201d?", "so?? she's still a minor...", "Yep. Had a friend that with his girlfriend planned a pregnancy so they could force their parents to let them get married. Let\u2019s just say that was the first of many falling dominos that literally ruined his entire life.", "And babies are expensive.", "And the HPV vaccine while she\u2019s at it.", "Honey you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live in a world that doesn\u2019t have something messing with your hormones. Literally everything does. The food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink. Even stress messes with hormones. That\u2019s why puberty starts earlier and earlier now than it did years ago.", "Well had two pediatricians tell me otherwise. So who am I going to believe? The professionals or strangers on Reddit? Everything has side effects.", "Or she\u2019ll sneak out and go see him anyways\u2026", "Either you never had a teenage daughter, or you\u2019re fooling yourself in thinking you knew everything that went on!", "But he\u2019s the adult (before the law) interacting with the minor so he absolutely has to abide what the parents tell him. They can put him into jail for not complying. I know it\u2019s maybe a bit weird for some people but I as a mother to two children - one being a girl - I would make this point very clear to Mateo that despite her daughter reciprocating his feelings for now, she IS STILL A MINOR and it\u2019s technically illegal what they are engaging in. And I wouldn\u2019t want to end up with a pregnant teen", "Ever heard of a vasectomy (completely reversible btw) or a condom?", "Why my children don't talk to me anymore?", "No. Just no. Worked in a sexual health clinic for years. This is not a thing. Not good medicine at all and what the actual hell?", "You clearly know nothing about women\u2019s biology. Birth control has often horrible side effects and can mess up your natural hormones, especially if started from a young age. From experience my period has never been the same because some AH doctor started me on it when I was 13.", "GTFO telling me what I do and do not know about anything. With a fucking exclamation point no less. You have a lot of nerve.", "Wow, I like how you're managing to be both ignorant AND condescending. That's talent!", "In 2023, that\u2019s not as easy as it once was. With cameras and door alarms and cell phones that can be gps-tracked, sneaking out should be very difficult. As a parent it\u2019s your job to do everything possible to prevent things like this from happening. And although she\u2019s only 2 years younger than him, he IS an adult. If she runs off he will be charged with kidnapping and endangering the welfare of a minor and she won\u2019t be able to marry him. I dare him to try it. He\u2019ll end up behind bars for a very long time.", "Not if they're in a state with Romeo and Juliet consent laws", "Vasectomies are not 100% completely reversible - they\u2019re just usually easier to reverse than other surgical birth controls. Also it\u2019s pretty expensive for an 18 year old. \n\nMateo is not her kid. Condoms should certainly be part of the safe sex convo with her daughter but they have a much higher failure rate than almost any female birth control.", "I was put on birth control at 14 because my period was so irregular (got it at the age of 13) and it was really disruptive of my day to day life and sports. I sure as hell didn't get it because I was sexually active :S", "Dude it\u2019s Reddit means nothing. What use does the voting have in everyday life? Seems like a silly thing to stress over. \ud83d\ude02I swear this world is full of hypocrites and it\u2019s so fucking sad it\u2019s hilarious! All these ppl saying don\u2019t do birth control it messes with your hormones are the same ppl stating I started my period when I was 8. Like do you seriously hear yourself?! Your hormones are already fucked which is why you started at a young age! My kids didn\u2019t have early puberty. I did my best to use all natural organic products. They\u2019re still exposed to hormonal triggers in everyday life but I did what I could to try and slow the process naturally. It wasn\u2019t perfect but thankfully their periods weren\u2019t as early as mine and my sister. 10, 8 My oldest started hers at 16 and my youngest was 15. Maybe if they would have started in elementary I\u2019d feel otherwise but it would depend on the amount of pain they were in during said period. Your chances of cancer greatly increase the younger you start I wonder if pain is the same. I had severe cramping when I started so my mom put me on the pill at 10. Also, ma\u2019am I don\u2019t even pretend to be a parent know it all. I stated what worked for me and mine and I thought it was common knowledge to put your kids on the pill. Everyone has the right to parent their kids however they want BUT don\u2019t come at me hypocrisy and think I\u2019ll back down. Also ma\u2019am I don\u2019t click on random links nor should you. That\u2019s how ppl get hacked.", "Well to each their own boo boo. I was started young and never had an issue. Do you eat grocery store produce? Do you eat meat? Do you drink tap water? Do you eat processed foods? Do you get vaccines? Do you live in a country that makes money by keeping us sick? Yeah EVERYTHING messes with hormones and can even cause cancer. We\u2019re living in a world that rushes death and you\u2019re worried about 1 thing out of thousands/millions of harmful possibilities. If birth control helps my daughter from debilitating pain during her cycle then I\u2019ll take my chances. Take that bullshit elsewhere! There\u2019s nothing more disgusting than a hypocrite!", "Quite sure these laws don\u2019t exist in other countries that aren\u2019t the USA. I know they don\u2019t in Germany and while it\u2019s generally accepted and not enforced, even \u201cconsensual\u201d sex between a legal minor and a legal adult even if one 16 and the other 18 is still not allowed, ESPECIALLY when she happens to get pregnant", "They are, if done correctly. I\u2019m not suggesting it for an 18 year old - obviously. But if it was my kid I would make it VERY clear to her boyfriend that I expect certain things to be done and done responsibly. \n\nI know condoms aren\u2019t the safest and you should ALWAYS take a pill as well. But a woman on the pill doesn\u2019t absolve a man from wearing a condom for safety (other than birth control) which is what most guys want to understand when a woman tells them she\u2019s on the pill. STDs exist as well and a pill won\u2019t help there", "Exactly. You were put on it for a medical reason. That is common.", "Debilitating pain is obviously different. \u2018Easing period cramps\u2019 however is not cause for bc. And yes everything is toxic but that doesn\u2019t make people who consume those things hypocrites, it\u2019s about minimizing harm.", "Isn't the age of consent in Germany 14? So this relationship would be totally legal anyway."]}
