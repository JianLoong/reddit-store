Describe your emotional state and boundaries. \n\n*I have felt uncomfortable around David for a while now and haven't found a way to voice it adequately. It's small things like <list small things>, leading up to bigger, more universally unacceptable transgressions on my boundaries like the time he unlocked the bathroom door and barged in while I was in the bathroom ignoring my plees for him to get out. These transgresssions creep me out, intimidate me and are frustrating. I don't feel safe or at ease around him.  When David bought the lingerie, you may see a joke, but not the broader mounting discomfort and sense of being threatened that I feel around him.*  \n  \n*I do not want to normalize him getting me lingerie for my birthday or barging in on me when I'm exposed.

I apologize for upset the outburst may have caused, but I stand firmly with my boundaries and find David's behavior unacceptable and creepy.*", "NTA That is all weird and I see red flags all over the place.
