It's your house and your rules, but don't be surprised when they say no to your rules and you damage the relationship with your kids.", "Absolutely the asshole.", "Hell yes YTA. Not just to her but your son too. They are adults and wanting to sleep with their spouses. They are not kids. No wonder they don\u2019t visit you. You will be lucky if they don\u2019t go NC on you.", "YTA. These people are married. They are a family.  Not just the same-sex couple-- What is your problem?  Do you expect your MARRIED kids to sleep in separate rooms when you go to visit them?  Are you afraid of Sex in your house?  Come on. That is highly unlikely, and, even if they do have sex, it is none of your business.  What is wrong with you?", "YTA, but not for the reason people are making it out.\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned that you don\u2019t ever sleep in the same room as your spouse when not in your own house for cultural reasons.\n\nCool.\n\nYou\u2019re TA because apparently you didn\u2019t tell them this before they came. I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re used to but this isn\u2019t the norm.\n\nYou are perfectly entitled to have any rules in your own house. That\u2019s fine. But if they\u2019re as different as this, then you should have told them before hand, so they can make an informed choice, rather than facing separation, or a hotel room, which is probably why she\u2019s cold to you. Because you have forced them into a hotel room", "I\u2019m struggling a little with this one; it sounds like it was a house rule that was known beforehand so the daughter knew what to expect. Based on this alone NTA.\n\nIt is, however, a little unconventional to expect wedded partners to sleep separately.", "Question: Do/ Did you and your husband sleep in separate rooms ? \n\nYTA", "That\u2019s what my first thought was. Why?", "Even as I read the title, I was going, \u201c WTELF\u201d!  And then I got down and saw how long they had been married an I literally facepalmed.  What the FUCK!!!", "This \u2b06\ufe0f You messed this up all by yourself. YTA", "I could only understand this if the rooms in question were so tiny they were little more than cupboards.  And still I'd give them the choice.\n\nYTA", "There have been several Reddit posts on this, and I just don't understand it.  I expect married people to sleep together and have sex.  They can try to be discreet, especially around kids, but that's part of being married.", "On top of the main (crazy) issue of making married couples sleep apart I find it really weird to also prepare a separate room for the 5-year old. Wouldn't most 5-year olds want to sleep with a parent in a non-familiar environment?", "OP also didn't state these terms until after the guests arrived, which is sketchy. This should have been mentioned upfront so they could decide whether to continue on and stay anyway or go somewhere else (or even not visit at all). This is how you lose contact with your kids.", "Nah to your NAH. If this was cultural, the daughter would have known to expect it. Maybe at one point it was some sort of tradition, but clearly it hasn't continued into the present day.", "\"BUT I WANT GRANDKIDS\"", "Sigh. You'd be shocked. I have family like this. Something along the lines of 'avoiding even the appearance of wrong doing'. Hell. I've got cousins who, once they hit about 13 and could be mistaken for adults or at least potentially able to indulge in adult activity weren't allowed to ride in the car with a brother or a male cousin alone because, gasp, what if someone who didn't know thought something was happening? (Insert image of falling over a fainting couch in a swoon) My uncles believed this kind of horse hucky. \n\nThat generational trauma aside: OP? Completely and utterly TA", "OP is a woman.", "OP is a she.", "Some people have extra rooms, especially if they live somewhere with a cheaper cost of living and/or own a larger house. My cousin and her husband owned a house that had 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms, even though the only people who lived there were my cousin, her husband, and their 2 kids.", "No, OP said their daughter has own house in nearby which they use when they visit. Itms just that this time the house is being renovated so they asked to stay with OP instead", "Yeah, just imagine...\n\nWashing machine.\nKitchen table.\nCouch.\nCoffee table.\nShower.\nCar in the garage.\n\nOR EITHER OF THE TWO BEDROOMS.\n\nDid OP forget how she made her daughter? People fuck.  Move on.", "I remember as a teen my mother thinking a 'no sleep over' and 'open door' rule would stop my boyfriend and I sleeping together. Yeah that totally worked /s", "They could even drill a hole in between the rooms", "\"ew, married people having sex? Icky yucky\"", "\u201cFine\u201d is a strong word tbh. They acknowledge it can\u2019t be helped, and that really there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, the younger ones might even manage to be enthusiastic about it but it\u2019s super hard to do that 180 at marriage from sex being dirty and sinful and bad to sex being perfectly allowed (technically encouraged but focusing on that feels so cringe). Source: was raised there.", "My parents only had a guest room with twin beds. My now ex husband and I just dealt with it. I brought my now husband home early in the relationship and suddenly the twins were pushed together.", "My parents pulled this this on me, their oldest son (late 20s) and my live in gf (early 30s), for Christmas many moons ago. My then GF snuck downstairs from my upstairs former bedroom late at night. She woke me up on the couch, and we did it just to spite my puritan parents who had 8 kids via immaculate conception apparently.\n\nWithin a few years my early 20s sister was allowed to LIVE with her bf in her bedroom in my folks\u2019 house and my other younger sisters could visit my parents\u2019 house and share bedrooms with their boyfriends. I even had to lie that I was going on a camping trip with a guy friend to borrow the family mini camper with my gf. I still can\u2019t believe the parenting double standards I was subjected to.", "Grade A Grandma!", "The first time I visited my \"aunt\" I came with several friends. She, too, apologized for the accommodations. She had made up guest beds for us all - five little twin cots in two different rooms. She directed the men to one room and the women to another. I thought this was hilarious as we were in town for a gay wedding, and only one of us was straight. \n\nI later found out on my next two visits that she's actually really liberal for an old Catholic woman. She had just divided it that way because our gender divide matched the number of cots in each room. She hadn't been expecting a car full of queers, but was cool with it. \n\nAlso she bought us all dollar store sandals so we didn't step on any scorpions while getting up to pee in the middle of the night, and cute sun hats. She is a wonderful Arizona host.", "I get the impression OP has a lot of business focused family members.", "Ruby?", "That's beyond \"uptight Midwestern Christian\" as they usually allow married couples to sleep together at least. This is more \"uptight control freak\"", "I'm a parent currently co-sleeping with our youngest who just turned 1.\n\nI regularly think further than the bedroom...", "Of course, everyone knows sexy times are impossible before 10am /s", "Tube slides for the win!", "Except....MARRIED.", "Sorry, what?", "Agreed. We can't assume people are lying. That's just not right because if they're not, we're attacking an innocent person. If they are lying, then that's on their conscience and not ours, but it's not our place to start just assuming this.", "My sister and her boyfriend used the laundry room during my parents Christmas Party when she was a teenager. No one knew.  Laundry room is a solid place to run away to.", "Ugh my washer and dryer are in the kitchen. Whoever designed this house was anti sneaky sex. The garage has worked in a pinch.", "I gave a hand job to my bf in my livingroom while my parents were in their bedroom. I could see the shadows of their feet when they came to their bedroom door. People gonna people.", "Not because of anything religious, or at least I dont think so...but my grandmother CRIED every time my mom got pregnant because it meant her legally married, in a church no less, daughter was having sex with her husband. Grandpa was mad and Grandma cried. She was an excellent grandma, loved us completely, but she left alot to desire as a mom.", "Eh, I could see that still though. If the OP and partner go to someone else's house, which realistically probably isn't all that often and, she said they sleep in separate rooms. She doesn't have to tell guests why, or she could tell them the truth by saying \"it's just how we show respect being in guests in a house\".  To them it's an 'ok cool.. weird.. cool' moment - doesn't mean they really understand the why and it's normal to not pry into things like 'sleeping separately'. \n\nAnd if daughter was never really subjected to it in a way like this, with a spouse, I can see why she wouldn't be expecting it. Friends, and partners growing up you just tell yourself \"yeah fair\" but when it's a spouse and mum is still doing it you're finally asking \"why\".  Because, I CAN see something like this just not ever being fully fleshed out.\n\nNot saying it's real, or anything just, I CAN see it happening, life isn't as black and white or perfectly communicated as many people on this sub (not saying you) seem to think. I could see mum explaining it in a way she thinks was good enough and daughter not thinking it would apply when she was older or married.", "> I mean, I honestly sleep better when I'm NOT sharing with my BF because he snores like an earthquake.  I love him and we spend 'quality time' together but if we had enough bedrooms for us to sleep separately, we would.\n\nThought you were my wife for a second.", "I remember having my very first deep fried pierogi at his house, but I\u2019m pretty sure that was one of the days we skipped school so we could bang all day. Sex and pierogis, l-i-v-i-n. \ud83e\udd5f\n\nThis was like\u202624 years ago (\ud83e\udd22) so my memory of the meals is hazy, but I know there was *always* pasta involved.", "IKR? My sons have had their girlfriends stay since they were sixteen. They were in committed respectful relationships. They\u2019re teenagers, they\u2019re going to have sex. Better they do it in a safe place and not a field or a car like I had to.", "Ahaha! When married, I took a certain perverse pleasure in pointing that out. People asked if we \u201cwere trying for kids\u201d, they\u2019d get something like \u201cDid you just ask if we bareback it?\u201d in response. \n\nSo rude and intrusive. Now I\u2019m divorced, openly trans masc, and pushing 45\u2026and at last nobody asks me about having kids anymore. At last. Although it took all three of those factors to make it stop. Smh.", "Econony 7 meter. It's cheaper. \n\n\n(For those who don't live in Britain, Economy 7 metres are those with a seperate day and night tariff, installed when people thought we'd have so much nuclear night time energy would be super cheap.)", "Well damn.  I apparently need to be following my husband into the laundry room late at night, it seems. \ud83d\ude04", "We told our 4ur old we were wrestling when she walked in on us\u2026", "\ud83d\udc80", "What a nice warm, touching memory. Sounds like you had fun.", "This made me laugh so hard I snorted. Thank you.", "Oh, damn, and I so wanted to have monkey sex on a table at a restaurant.\ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd23", "Did your grandparents not have doors that locked?!", "A snort is a deep compliment :)", "Oooff. That sounds insufferable. It sounds like Captain projection needs therapy, but that isn't your cross to bare. That's a solid decision going low/no contact.\n\nOn a separate note, peanut butter balls are delicious and now I'm hankering for one.", "No, unless you intend to be never invited again", "Eh get a study shower chair, some grab bars and some non skid tape and that will cut down on the fall risk lol", "Hell, at 63, if my wife and I tried to use the floor like we did in our 20s we would have to call the fire department to help us up. With my knees and her back we would probably never walk again. Forget about the shower.", "Must have been pretty young grandparents to still need birth control!"]}
