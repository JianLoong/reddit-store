YTA and I wouldn't be surprised if your daughter decided to have fewer visits.", "I\u2019m calling cap on this. If this \u201cculture\u201d is so old school we\u2019re going back to the Tudor age when man and wife only saw each other for procreation and didn\u2019t sleep in bed together, then I highly doubt that you would be as supportive of your lesbian daughter with how serious you take this stupid rule.\n\nNo wonder she never visits you with this backwards nonsense.", "Then why was your daughter surprised by these plans?", "You should be uncomfortable, then. Because it\u2019s not a valid reason to be uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, there is no culture on earth that\u2019s this anti-sex yet not anti-LGBT as well.", "> That is how my family, my husband's family and my culture views this\n\nNo culture says that spouses can't share a room in a guest's house.", "What culture?", "Then why was your daughter surprised if this is tradition?", "Her culture is \u201cuptight midwestern Christian lady\u201d culture.", "\"If mama aint getting any, you're not getting any\"", "Yep but that's a crock bc she says her \"friends\" presumably some from her \"culture\" called her an AH too.", "I can\u2019t accept that there is a nation of adults who make their 50 year old children sleep in separate rooms from their legal spouses.

I honestly thought it was a gay thing until her little brother brought a girl home for the first time and she had to sleep in the guest room too. My fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mom is a very old school Irish/Italian Catholic and not great about her daughter being bi but there are some things that are more about tradition than anything else. We do still end up sharing most nights anyway and everyone knows it but we have to maintain the illusion.", "Oh I completely agree and anyone who says differently is insane. BUT there are over the top religious people who would be against it. They\u2019re very wrong and any consenting people should be allowed to share a bed anywhere but I at least see the \u201cSIN\u201d argument. But not for married couples.", "I agree, but at least that is something I can wrap my head around. This? No.", "Sshh, parents don't think further than the bedroom lol", "Right?  She just gave them their choice of rooms to have sex in.", "She mentions her husband\u2019s family in the present tense in a comment reply so I thought currently married", "Boyfriends I can understand. But spouses? That's just weird.", "No they aren't, this is super weird lol", "how is asking someone not to cum in your house not reasonable? am i missing something?", "I like your grandma", "This whole thread reminds me of when I was dating my ex and living in my aunts house. I had gone back to school for a career switch and we were long distance and whenever he would come to town he stayed at his parents house and tiptoed around staying over. After he left the one time my aunt looked at me and asked \u2018what does he think I am, your aunt or your governess?\u201d I deadpanned and replied \u2018which do you think\u2019 and she said \u2018if I am then I need to change jobs, I\u2019m terrible at this\u2019\u2026\n\nI was about 27 or so at the time.", "And that's totally fair.", "I married into the wrong family. Lol.", "This made my dyslexia worse xD", "I\u2019m over here tryna figure out what culture could be progressive enough to support an LGBTQ daughter but conservative enough to ask all married people to sleep separately and I think my brain is overheating\u2026", "If I'm a guest in someone's house, I don't", "That it is inappropriate to sleep in the same room as your spouse, when you're in someone else's house as a guest", "Not just a midwestern thing. My fam were Irish/Italian Catholics from the Northeast and same thing. Tho it didn\u2019t extend to married couples, only the unmarried couples couldn\u2019t share a bed. So my bf (now husband) didn\u2019t sleep over at their house until we were married and unless we had to", "Some traditions are dumb", "I am a parent, who used laundry room to hide from kids. Also covers some noise, hehe", "They hate this one trick...", "Why choose? Just do both", "Yea I just read that.   So either Husband just doesn't go with her....or..widowed.  I hear many widows still use present tense of Husband because they still consider themselves married.", "You can pretend to be incredulous if you want, that doesn\u2019t make me any less correct in what I\u2019m saying. \n\nIf it\u2019s so \u201creasonable\u201d as you say, how about you give me a \u201creason\u201d that makes sense.", "How would people having sex in a closed room impact you? As long as they aren't being loud, you will never know.", "Yeah, I can't grasp it myself.", "I know in Japan and India it\u2019s not super uncommon for married couples to sleep separately but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a mandate like they CAN\u2019T sleep together. Of course there are subcultures/practices that may vary so it\u2019s possible there exists such a tradition but I haven\u2019t found it. Also it\u2019s crazy that she has THREE spare rooms ready to go. Although I guess you\u2019d have to if those are the rules you live by. When I visited family as a kid we\u2019d be lucky to get one room for the three of us.", "Wait, so you normally share a bed or at least a room with your spouse but when you visit someone you expect to be put up separately?! And\u2026 people don\u2019t find that a massive burden? This is so odd, usually people accept closer quarters when visiting, not MORE space to themselves. What culture is this?", "When hosting, hosts generally do not separate married couple. People generally do not get frisky when staying over as a guest.\n\nBut you have every right to abide by your prerogative, just like your daughter and her family have every right to choose alternative housing options where there aren\u2019t any restrictions around a married couple sharing a bed and sleeping together.", "That is just so odd to me\u2026i really want to know what culture is enforcing this\u2026I respect your privacy, I\u2019m just baffled", "People can normally keep it together when they are guest in other peoples home.", "So you inconvenience your hosts by making them prepare multiple rooms for you ?", "Why tho?", "That's insane.

It\u2019s also rude and inappropriate to stick your nose and dictate their marriage. You have no problem doing that.", "What about a hotel? Would it make a difference \n if the hotel was owned by an LLC or a dba? How about a small family owned bed and breakfast? Would you be morally obligated to book two rooms?", "If you're going to enforce this ridiculous idea, you can't complain when they choose to stay somewhere else.", "Oh please YTA", "so if you go stay at someone\u2019s house, you ask them to make up two separate beds/rooms for you??", "Stop making up things", "You obviously didn't raise your daughter in this culture since she was surprised by the sleeping arrangements. Also, why would you feel it's disrespectful for them to get a hotel for their own comfort. They are accustomed to sleeping next to eachother, many couples who share a bed regularly sleep badly when separated. A hotel room is respecting your choice to not allow couples to co-sleep in your house while also remaining comfortable together.", "That is so weird!!", "Welp, they're not in your house anymore, are they, so you got what you wanted. I hope you're looking forward to being put on the no contact list. YTA btw", "Which culture is this?", "Wow, where did you learn this? It\u2019s literally insane. YTA", "Genuinely asking: so no one in your culture can host a couple for the night without having 3 bedrooms? 2 if someone takes the couch?", "I can't stop laughing at your logic at all. Have never ever heard of this before.", "What??  Everyone has multiple guest rooms?", "What culture are you referring to? What county is this in?", "Wtf?  What culture does that come from?  YTA definitely.  If I was your kids, I would never stay with you and likely never visit.", "This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of.

YTA.", "LOL where did you learn that?", "Spin cycle?", "Yes, but the thing is, most parents act oblivious about that thing, and when they disallow their kid's spouses to sleep in the same room thinking \"problem solved, I can rest easily\" they forget that... you can do it anywhere", "Conceived our second in the laundry room while our toddler played in the next room.", "i don\u2019t want someone else cumming in my house is a good enough answer", "Yeah, in what culture is everyone expected to maintain 3+ guest bedrooms so families can all be split up like this?", "Agreed.
