Now that you are without college debt and making money, you want to reneg on the deal because - hey - you want all the money for you? Why are you wondering whether you are the asshole? YTA. Why are you surprised that your siblings are mad at you? That college education sure did not equip you to be the sharpest tool in the shed.", "Wow - YTA\nMajorly. \n\nI cant believe how selfish this post is.

ALSO your parents managed somehow to cover almost all of some of the other kids college costs so they never came to ask you before. NOW you are doing well financially and can afford it according to you but you said no because you and your husband \"agreed\" to not give the $5,000. Let me ask you this, did you ever tell your husband while you were dating that your parents let you use up the college savings that should have been split into 4 just for yourself, upon the agreement that you would help out later on? If not, that's a huge mistake on your part but doesn't absolve you of your promise.

You get the idea. The youngest would then be responsible in our parents' old age (since they didn't have anyone to pay for next). Any postgrad education would have to be self-funded.\n\nBecause our oldest brother knows the deal, he didn't get married until the second eldest got a degree.

See how that works? They're gone.  You blew it.", "At this point I think it's abundantly clear that YTA, but since you still seem confused, let's break this down and tackle one of your points at a time.\n\n\" if I\u2019m being the asshole to anyone it\u2019s my parents not my siblings\"  \nActually, you're being the asshole to all of them. To your parents by reneging on the deal you agreed to, when you were fully old enough to be making decisions for yourself, so this \"when I was a teen\" business doesn't hold water. You were old enough to decide to go to college. If you had gotten student loans, you would have been liable for paying them back. But because your loan was privately funded, you think you can just shrug and say \"well my life is more important.\" A lending agency would have zero patience with this excuse, and your family who scrimped and saved to send you to college is not due less respect just because they're family.\n\nYou're being an asshole to your siblings because you are robbing them of their money. It was never yours. It was loaned to you so that you could get a start on your education, and be in a position to pay it back so that they could have the same opportunity you had: to get through college without wondering whether you would be able to pay tuition. You seem to think that because they would have to incur less debt than you would have, it's no big deal, but of course it's not a big deal to you: you already got everything handed to you. Your siblings were assured a certain degree of assistance, and it is falling through not because of their actions, but because you don't feel like paying for their education is your responsibility. \n\nSo let's say this in no uncertain terms: you're not paying for their education. You are, in effect, paying for *your* education. You are repaying the loan you took out at the start of college, except instead of paying faceless lenders with a gargantuan interest rate, you're being asked to repay your parents a modest sum, so that they can give your siblings the same opportunity you had. That opportunity was to not have to take out predatory student loans. It does not mean you have no debt. So don't say you got through debt-free, and use exact language: you don't owe an agency, but you do have debt, and trying to erase that compounds your AHness.\n\nThen there's this bit: \"it\u2019s not like I said I\u2019d never pay them back ever\"\n\nSo, when do you plan on paying them back? After they have to take a job in order to pay their tuition? Drop down to part-time status, perhaps, which means it will take them longer to start earning anywhere near your income? Lenders would go broke if everyone repaid their debts with your sense of urgency. (Which might not be the worst outcome ever, but I digress.) You don't get to decide when the money you borrowed is needed. It is needed now, and since you claim to be an adult, it's time to do the grown-up thing and pay your bills. Or would you rather tell your landlord or mortgage official that you're sorry you can't pay your rent, but you've got to save up so you just can't do it right now?\n\nThe sooner you recognize that this is indeed a debt that you owe and take it seriously, the better your odds are for mending this rift in your family. Since you seem to think their behavior is problematic, this is the recipe for altering it: give your parents $5k for tuition costs. Repeat as needed, until the debt has been discharged. Apologize profusely for thinking your life is more important than the lives of your parents and siblings. I can't promise this will change things, but it's the only thing that has a chance. Moreover, it's the right thing to do.\n\nIf you don't care about any of this, please don't try for children.
