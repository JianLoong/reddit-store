Now that you are without college debt and making money, you want to reneg on the deal because - hey - you want all the money for you? Why are you wondering whether you are the asshole? YTA.

ALSO your parents managed somehow to cover almost all of some of the other kids college costs so they never came to ask you before. NOW you are doing well financially and can afford it according to you but you said no because you and your husband \"agreed\" to not give the $5,000. Let me ask you this, did you ever tell your husband while you were dating that your parents let you use up the college savings that should have been split into 4 just for yourself, upon the agreement that you would help out later on? If not, that's a huge mistake on your part but doesn't absolve you of your promise.

You get the idea. The youngest would have then be rssponsible in our parents' old age (since they didn't have anyone to pay for next). Any postgrad education would have to be self-funded.\n\nBecause our oldest brother knows the deal, he didn't get married until the second eldest got a degree.

The siblings likely want families, too.", "Not the greatest parents, tbh", "Yeah, I'm getting golden child vibes", "Karma is a bitch, Leave Op to time!", "Like I think while reading this I audibly gasped.\n\nI dont see how OP could a)deny the parents the money and then b) type out the whole scenario and still wonder if theyre the AH", "Tell your partner that his parents gave you an unconditional gift for the wedding but your parents offered you a deal for school, which you accepted, that *did* have conditions and you're now reneging on that agreement. You took money that was earmarked for them so you didn't have to go into debt, even by *only* $2.5k, on the condition that you would pay up to $6k a year to make up for that.\n\nTell your partner he's marrying a selfish AH whose word is worth nothing so he's clear on how you treat family and can plan accordingly.\n\nWow YTA.", "And did you tell him that you took their money and had a deal with them because I bet if you said no I don't plan to pay if you need they wouldn't have given it to you. or you just acted innocent. and just be nice you are doing what you said you really are a AH", "You decided to go to a college that would cost more and your parents were kind enough to support you through it. You took 75k extra!!! And they only want 5k back! If I was your family I\u2019d never speak to you again. You\u2019re lucky your family doesn\u2019t want the 75k back", "It doesn't matter if he understands. It doesn't matter what he believes. He is wrong.\n\nGiving the money if you were alone wouldn't be \"to be nice\" it would be meeting you obligation. And if you don't pay you are disgusting.\n\nHopefully you live somewhere that verbal contracts are binding and your parents sue you for the money", "Your parents gave you an extra $75,000 to save you from debt. All they have asked for back is $5k to give your sibling the same chance to be debt free. \n\nYou made a verbal contract in exchange for your parents giving you their entire savings so you could be debt free. \n\nYou are so lucky and are throwing it back in their faces. They didn\u2019t tell you to \u201cjust get a job\u201d", "Um, sorry but I am just shaking my head here to try to understand your \"logic\".\n\nOK your partners parents covered his school costs because they could afford to do it.  Got it. \n\nThey are giving you both money towards your wedding because they can afford to do it and want to do it which is very nice of them. Got it.\n\nDo you NOT understand that those things are totally irrelevant to this situation? The one you wrote in about?? You would have been in debt \"10's of thousands\" you say IF your parents hadn't kindly let you use ALL of the saved college money, knowing that you would make good on your promise down the line if they needed you to. Do you realize how much money that saved you in interest payments over the years had you actually had that debt? You met your boyfriend/future husband and were able to say that you had no debt. How awesome is that? Pretty nice huh? Well guess what it's now down the line and they are simply asking your to pitch in $5,000 which is $2,500 for each sibling. That is a pittance to what you agreed to. Wake up and realize this has absolutely nothing to do with your future husbands situation and finances. You have a responsibility that you agreed to and that is the actual thing that matters here. The only thing. Also do you realize that you are basically cutting your entire family out of your life with this terrible thing you are doing?", "Also I\u2019d like to add, if your partner doesn\u2019t understand that you need to pay that 5k, they\u2019re selfish too. Does your partner have many siblings? Then they might not understand how hard it can be for parents to save enough money to cover the tuition for four kids.\n\nBeing married doesn\u2019t excuse you from fulfilling the promise you made to your parents. Who paid for your school? Your parents. Why would you treat them like that?", "If it's  only 2.5k, I don't understand why you don't just pay it? It's ONLY 2.5. after all.", "Wow, big YTA. Your parents gave you money on the condition that you\u2019d help pay for your siblings. It\u2019s selfish to take away the money that otherwise would\u2019ve been given to your siblings just because you didn\u2019t want to be in debt. And now you\u2019re telling them to go into debt? What kind of logic is that? If you think 2.5k each is small then you should just pay it. You\u2019re ruining your relationship with your family by being selfish.", "You're still a giant AH. You gave your word. You have a debt.", "Because you took your siblings money. It wasn\u2019t intended for you in the first place. Maybe you\u2019re purposely misrepresenting the situation and that\u2019s why he \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d that YTA. You were each set to get 25k but you decided to take that from them, and lied about helping. Congratulations, hope it was worth the relationship with your family.", "I wish I could downvote this 5 million times. YTA. Your parents should make you pay back everything they spent on your college.", "Your partner needs to understand that you made a verbal contract with your parents to repay a loan. Not a gift. A LOAN. Just because their parents can afford to give big gifts doesn\u2019t mean everyone can. \n\nYTA . \n\nI feel bad for your parents and siblings, what you are doing is ridiculously underhanded.", "I am sick and tired of this \"not my responsibility\" bull.  You took money from your siblings.  It is most certainly your responsibility to pay it back.", "i hope you get absolutely nothing in the will because \u201cyou didn\u2019t ask for them to give you the money\u201d your siblings deserve their share, and in the end i hope they will get it one way or the other. it\u2019s not fair and you\u2019re so deep in the wrong here.", "Lmao what is there for him to understand? You made a promise to help your siblings financially in exchange for taking that 100k for yourself. I don\u2019t care what kind of degree you have and that you needed it more. Your greedy af and it shows.", "Does your partner know that your parents gave you your siblings college money?  You are supposed to pay back THEIR MONEY that you essentially borrowed.  Grow the fuck up and pay back your parents/siblings you entitled AH.", "Unlikely, the general rule about when a contract has to be in writing (called the statute of frauds) includes when it cannot be completed within one year.  While this can be stretched (because \"won't\" isn't technically the same as \"can't\"), I think this would fail.\n\nHe sucks, but the law probably wouldn't be able to help here.", "You owe your siblings the debt they (unknowingly and without consent) saved you from", "You took there share of the college fund. You do owe them money.", "So would you rather your parents just gave you 25k instead of 100k.\n\nAll they are asking for is 5k, that's very reasonable since they used 4 kids college savings on you. Would you rather be paying masses amount of debt?", "You do owe your siblings. You made a deal to take the entire lump sums of your parents savings by saying you'd help pay for their college. Money and how YOU'RE behaving is the issue. Also you presumably were at least 18 at the time you made the deal and 22 by the time you finished college. How are you going to use you're age then to justify your actions now? \n\n\nTLDR you have no moral standing and should be ashamed.", "But you DO owe them. You took money earmarked for them with the promise to pay it back. \n\nYou have now \u201cdecided\u201d you won\u2019t do that. \n\nHow are you not seeing you are totally In the wrong here. \n\nYou basically said fuck em I got mine. Why would they ever speak to you again? You aren\u2019t coming off as a loving sibling to say the least.\n\nYTA", "You said you didn't owe your siblings anything. Well, that's a two way street. They don't owe you anything either, your relationships included. They have every right to cut you off. If money isn't the issue, cough it up.", "You\u2019re an asshole.", "You do realize you made a verbal contract yeah? Those are legally enforceable and they\u2019d be well within their rights to sue you.", "They're mad at you because you're acting like being the oldest means you deserve the money more.  Of course YTA.", "You do owe them because you took their money. And exactly when do you plan on \u201cpaying them back\u201d? YTA btw", "You owe you\u2019re siblings 75k because you took that from them with the agreement that you\u2019d pay them back. You\u2019re lucky they only want 5k back you selfish prick", "Hopefully op\u2019s partner lives them at the alter. Then I hope op\u2019s family turns their back on them.\n\nThey would truly deserve it!", "also if it isn\u2019t clear YTA", "Yeah that sucks.\n\nI hope the  ah partner is worth loosing ops family for. Because op sold them out to keep a person.\n\nI hope the partner leaves op and the family had nothing to do with op. I hope op realizes what it\u2019s like to have no one to depend on. That would be awesome karma!", "He is, a delusional one at that.", "Nah that would just be a waste of everyone else's time and money. Call it off early and OP will have the money to pay and get better as a person.", "Nah I would rather see them publicly humiliated and realize \nBecause of his behavior he has no one to turn too.\n\nBut I am petty as hell!"]}
