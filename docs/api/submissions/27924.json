Even if it were, most of the people I know who work or worked in the military got better stuff to worry about than someone playing soldier.", "Big difference between honoring your father simply by wearing his jacket and stolen valor. I am assuming that is what she was referring to by saying it was disrespectful. Stolen valor is deception that you are or were a service member in order to get veteran benefits or simply attention. These idiots wear the full uniform (usually incorrectly). What you did was nowhere near that. Don\u2019t let this girl stop you from honoring your father.", "NTA. If you intend respect, and your dad, the actual vet in question, thinks it\u2019s the opposite of disrespect, why would you give any shits what some random thinks? She jelly. Hug your dad.", " NTA. In high-school back in the 70s I and a lot of other students and teachers wore them.", "NTA, OP.  Wearing your Dad's jacket is not disrespectful. It's a tribute to him from a respectful child.  That person who mouthed off is irrelevant and is clueless.", "Not wrong at all, she doesnt know what she's talking about. If it was disrespectful, your dad probably wouldn't hand it over", "NTA. Who is she to say it's disrespectful? She doesn't know you and more disrespectful on her end to make such a comment she just walk off.", "NTA \n\nUnless you said it was from your military service I don\u2019t see the problem.", "NTA.  You were honoring your father for his service.  Her opinion doesn\u2019t matter, especially since she didn\u2019t even stick around to hear an explanation.", "NTA! I\u2019d like to be a fly on the wall when she learns about army surplus stores.", "NTA people wear their loved ones' military jackets all the time. Sometimes it's a way to honor their service, sometimes they just like the look. That girl's a moron.", "I think it\u2019s awesome you ge to wear your dads jacket and that he\u2019s excited to have you wear it\n\nThere was a video of a biker dude filling up at a gas pump and he had a leather vest on. \n\nSome dickwad kept telling him to take it off because if he\u2019s not in motorcycle club then it\u2019s disrespectful or some dumb shit\n\nThe guy conceded and took it off, but only to appease the guy because it just wasn\u2019t worth it. \n\nWhere what you want. Just don\u2019t lie and say you served (which I know you didn\u2019t /wouldn\u2019t)", "NTA - you wore your dad's jacket with his permission and as a sign of love & respect for him. It was not stolen valour, you did not portray the jacket as your own.", "NTA - this girl is just an idiot (the older you get, the more of them you'll find) \n\nAnd thank your father for his service for me.", "NTA\n\n> I went to a high school football game.

Dads tend to love handing down clothes, and yours was fine with it. You weren't pretending to be in the army and were honest about who the jacket belonged to. My dad was also in the army, and he gave me a couple of BDUs, but wearing those doesn't mean I was in the army or anything.\n\nYou can also usually buy army jackets at military surplus stores and thrift stores that support US troops. Even if you had just bought the jacket, you'd have done nothing wrong. That girl needs to mind her own business rather than judging you in public.", "NTA- I got an army hat from a relative who served.  You better believe I wore the heck out of it, and told my classmates about him.  I was pretty young.", "NTA it was your dads, you're wearing it with his blessings, you said straight up no when asked if it was yours. Over here when I was a kid I used to march in the ANZAC parade wearing my pops medals. Proudest I felt as a young kid.", "NTA. My sister wore our great uncle's army jacket all through high school", "This! OP isn\u2019t claiming they you were a service member, but just honoring their father.", "As long as you're not saying it's yours, that you served in the Army, most veterans don't have a problem with it. My sons have worn my old field jacket many times, i did remove the stripes, just to keep people from bitching about it.", "NTA\n\nThere is nothing wrong or particularly out of the ordinary about wearing army surplus gear - people have been doing it for pretty much as long as there has been a military.\n\nYou also get a further pass for the fact that you aren't actually wearing surplus gear from a shop, but your dad's own issues jacket. \n\nThe only issue that can get a bit heated is the idea of stolen valor. If you were going around in full fatigues pretending you were military to take advantage of certain situations then yes, you would justifiably be considered an asshole by many. Wearing a jacket as part of an otherwise non-uniform outfit, and being completely upfront about it however? Not an issue.", "NTA at all. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about, and she\u2019s just trying to stir shit.\n\nYou\u2019re going to encounter people like that as you go through life\u2026 it\u2019s hard I know, but try not to let it get to you.\n\nMy dad was in my country\u2019s Air Force, and he gave me his hat to wear when I was in high school and needed a wide-brimmed hat.\n\nIt\u2019s been mine ever since, and every time I wear it I think of my dad.\n\nYou love your dad and you\u2019re proud of his service - there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. Dude, she's some nobody who doesn't know anything about you or why you wore the jacket. Its weird that you even care what she thinks", "Not disrespectful.  I wear my husband's unit sweatshirts all the time! \n\nThis person is going to eventually learn it's dangerous not to mind their own business. \n\nNTA", "NTA end of the day it\u2019s clothing and your dad said you could wear it but damn do I hope it\u2019s not ucp camo.", "Who cares what some random girl thinks? Don't worry about it. \n\nNTA", "She also may think it\u2019s disrespectful excuse she\u2019s a pacifist or maybe from somewhere where the military was in her country.
