I like his family but they are just very extroverted (a bit chaotic) family, and I\u2019m a fairly introverted person who needs space. \n\nMy main issue is that he wants to fly up there and have us stay at their house with no car. Also their house is full so we\u2019d be sleeping on the separate couches in the living room. Im not really okay with that because his family doesn\u2019t usually go to bed until like 2am and they also wake up at like 6 or 7 am, and they have kids that will be running around and playing. Sleeping would not be happening. He knows this and I offered to pay for the hotel room and rental car and he refuses it for some reason. His excuse is \u201cyou don\u2019t need sleep bc we\u2019ll be on vacation.\u201d  I hardly see staying at my inlaws with no escape as a vacation. I\u2019m frustrated bc I feel like he won\u2019t work with me on anything. I obviously have the option of just not going and staying home but then I\u2019d be alone at a Christmas and for two weeks in January and I don\u2019t want that.

I\u2019m being told I\u2019m selfish bc I don\u2019t want to stay at their house  but I feel that I\u2019m not asking for a lot.

Think long and hard if you are ok with being disrespected by him like this for years. NTA", "NTA-can you just not go? Before we had kids, my spouse and I just spent holidays with out own families. I was annoyed because I was in the same situation. He wanted to \u201cparty\u201d with his family while I was stuck with no car. I told him I\u2019m okay if he wants to just be with them.

However\u2026 his parents are divorced so that means splitting time when we see them (and now they live in two different cities that are significant driving distance apart in a state that\u2019s like an 11 hour drive to get to - my husband won\u2019t fly right now). My husband also gets to fly for free so it seems a little ridiculous that he won\u2019t go for 4-5 days and just fly there, rent a car to get to the other city, and then fly home. \n\nHis family is very loud, fairly conservative, and his dad remarried (to a woman we like a lot) who has a billion kids and grandkids. Whenever I do go to visit I end up being the liaison and he just kind of fucks off and does what he wants. \n\nI totally understand he doesn\u2019t see them more than like 4 times a year, but I am upset that he wants to drive down for an entire week for thanksgiving - meaning I\u2019ll be relatively alone for the week besides the day of. I didn\u2019t want to leave my parents and brother solo because that\u2019s the extent of our family. \n\nI also am recovering from some serious physical and mental health issues that came up from the job I just quit and I don\u2019t want his family to see me like this. I need to spend the time continuing to interview and apply for jobs as well. It has been going ok but I do not want to spend money and going would mean putting our dog in boarding (would probably be like 500-700 dollars) and probably asking his mom for money, which I already hate doing and am being relatively bankrolled by my husband until I find a job which sucks. \n\nThen there\u2019s Christmas - he wants to go out for another week to Florida with his mom and sister to do Christmas with his grandma, aunt and uncle, and cousins. They are all very wealthy and very judgmental. He also wants to drive again. He told me he would try to be back for NYE but I have a feeling that\u2019s not going to happen. Also every year there ends up being a drunk political/historical argument and I have strong opinions\u2026 last time I saw them I had to leave the room after his cousin said there weren\u2019t lynchings in the US. \n\nI do care about his family but I\u2019m really not in the space for this right now physically, mentally, or financially. And I\u2019m a bit disappointed he won\u2019t spend either holiday with my family: I understand they live about a 30 min drive from us and we do see them maybe once every other month but in the end it just seems kinda shitty. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, OP. Personally I would say\u2026 don\u2019t force yourself to go if you\u2019re going to be miserable the whole time. Being alone sucks but at least you get some \u201cme time\u201d. I would see if he\u2019s willing to shorten the trips maybe.", "Definitely NTA. Please do not marry this man. This fight is just a trailer for how the rest of your life is going to be if you marry him. You constantly compromising on your needs and him calling you crazy and not understanding you. I think him not understanding your point of view is a big red flag. Your feelings are valid. I too am an introvert. I also need a lot of space. My in laws are also very loud, very extrovert and they give me no space. I understand your frustration there. Luckily my husband understands my needs and he tries to make me comfortable while visiting in laws.  But I cannot imagine how sad I would feel if he just dismissed my feelings and called me crazy. \nYour fiance is in the wrong here. You are already visiting them in January\n He should understand your perspective. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA. Tell him you want to sleep in a bed in a room behind a closed door where you can have some privacy and space. You'd get no sleep but I bet the parents of the kids running around would!

I didn\u2019t see if you had family you want to see as well? Holidays are always a negotiation on who you will be seeing and when, we do thanksgiving down at my in laws since they love thanksgiving and Christmas up here with mine since that\u2019s more our jam. Your husband needs to cut the cord and realize it takes two otherwise it\u2019s going to be a rough marriage that probably won\u2019t last long.\n\nAlso as a fellow introvert with extroverted and loud in-laws I sympathize, it took a year of two for them to understand that I would disappear for a little bit sometimes to go recharge, not that I didn\u2019t like them, just needed some me time!", "So this is more about the holidays\u2026 he clearly likes the \u201cchaos\u201d and you clearly don\u2019t.

In fact, it will get significantly worse. NTA", "I am shocked that a guy would be so excited about not sleeping next to their partner for that long. If it was one, maybe 2 nights, I could see it. But what couple gladly wants to not be sleeping together and not having sex or fooling around for that long??? My husband works overnights and I miss having him near even after one night. I couldn\u2019t imagine us going anywhere and having him be like \u201cawesome, I don\u2019t get to sleep with my wife nor do I get to have sex with my wife!

Especially considering how stressed you already are about not getting any rest over the holidays. So you can have a place to escape to when it just becomes too much and to get some rest after visiting.\nMy husband and I do this when visiting my family because of the # of people that are staying in the home.\nHis parents are now deceased, and we host alt holidays. That\u2019s a huge cost and a lot with two holidays Back to back. \n\nDo you have issues with the in-laws? Is your family out of the picture as far as celebrating holidays with?

He's also saying you wont need sleep because you're on vacation. Idk about you but when I'm on vacation sleep is the first and foremost priority. Everything else is extra.", "NTA but you can\u2019t have it both ways. Fly up, get a hotel and car, and come and go as you please. The living arrangements sound crazy and your husband should compromise with you a bit but I\u2019m sure in his mind, this is their normal so he doesn\u2019t get why you can\u2019t deal with you.", "All family dynamics are different and when you get married that must be taken into account. My partner was used to sometimes spending holidays with his family and sometimes not. Christmas is absolutely non-negotiable in our family. Everyone is always there. Period. We always spend the holidays with family (trying to incorporate both sides but it rarely works). We\u2019ve both discussed where and how long we\u2019re willing to stay somewhere. I must have our own bed in our own room or we get a hotel. That\u2019s my condition. If we don\u2019t have a family member\u2019s car that we can freely use whenever we want, then we rent one. That\u2019s his condition. Then we both decide how long we can afford to stay based on if we\u2019re staying with family (in agreed upon conditions) or staying at a hotel. You and your fianc\u00e9 need to discuss this further and both compromise. It\u2019s probably unreasonable to spend Christmas alone, but it also sounds unreasonable for a grown couple to couch surf.", "NTA who says they don\u2019t need sleep on vacation???? Vacation is when I finally get good sleep! Him calling you crazy is also rude as hell. You are being completely reasonable. Please don\u2019t let him bully you into this", "NTA. Just get a goddamn hotel room and rental car for yourself. Why are you waiting for his permission? He can either sleep on the couch at his mommy\u2019s house or sleep in a hotel room with his wife.", "NTA. You are being gaslit. Do not give in, he is the wrong one for not listening to your feelings and trying to comporomise.", "NTA.\n\nThat much time is too much.  Also, many people don't get all the holidays with their families anymore once they're partnered.  There's someone else to consider who has their own family of origin or might just want to nest.  \n\nFrom what you describe, he's absolutely wrong as far as the way he handled this, but I do wonder about some things.  Did he move under duress?  If he never wanted to live far from his family and you gave him an ultimatum, he can't choose you and then be passive-aggressive the rest of his life.  He has to own his choice.  He can get sad sometimes, but you can't keep this level of going back and forth up forever.  Does he intend this to be permanent, or is he just having a rough time initially as he adjusts to not seeing them often?  Does he facetime/skype with them?  When my brother was between wives, we used to have dinner with him on weekends by setting up a laptop on the dining room table.  It was like he was sitting there with us.  Remind him that he can do this and he's not as cut off from them as he would have been before that tech was available.\n\nDon't get married before you thoroughly work this all out.", "I LOATHE people who say \u201cYou don\u2019t need that much sleep.

My family is like this and trust me this won\u2019t change.  This is a sign of incompatibility that will be a huge deal when you have kids.  I had created boundaries on my terms before I met my husband so no one blames him that we participate on our terms.\n\nYour husband is the biggest asshole for not making it clear what expectations his family and he would put on an introverted person.

IDK about him but when I'm on vacation from work I want to sleep and relax?", "Hard NTA. Reading this brought back rough memories. This was us just a few years ago. The only thing that changed was that my wretched MIL flipped out on me in front of my husband and he saw her go from 0-60 over nothing. It was the first time he\u2019d seen his mom in that light and it changed his perception of her. It took almost 8 years and nearly divorcing for him to see it for himself. \n\nIt turned out okay for us and we are stronger than I could\u2019ve imagined now, but I can also see a parallel universe where she kept playing nice in front of him.

This is a sign of a larger communication problem.", "NTA.\n\n It seems like he wants to go and fold back into the family like he's still a kid. Having no private room and no personal vehicle to get a little alone time seem ridiculous to me once you're an adult. The fact that he's not even attempting to compromise in order for you to be equally comfortable is a red flag to me, OP. \n\nIf him going to his family alone for both Christmas and in January are what it takes to help him understand that things have to change, it's what you need to do. Renting a room and a car so the two of you can be comfortable while visiting isn't selfish. It's normal adult behavior. Besides, staying that long at anyone's home is overkill.
