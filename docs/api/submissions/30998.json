We already had plans to visit them for 2 weeks in January which I\u2019m not super stoked about, but now he also wants to visit them for Christmas for a few days which I wasn\u2019t really looking forward to bc I want to spend this Christmas with just us this year. I like his family but they are just very extroverted (a bit chaotic) family, and I\u2019m a fairly introverted person who needs space. \n\nMy main issue is that he wants to fly up there and have us stay at their house with no car. Also their house is full so we\u2019d be sleeping on the separate couches in the living room. Im not really okay with that because his family doesn\u2019t usually go to bed until like 2am and they also wake up at like 6 or 7 am, and they have kids that will be running around and playing. Sleeping would not be happening. He knows this and I offered to pay for the hotel room and rental car and he refuses it for some reason. His excuse is \u201cyou don\u2019t need sleep bc we\u2019ll be on vacation.\u201d  I hardly see staying at my inlaws with no escape as a vacation. I\u2019m frustrated bc I feel like he won\u2019t work with me on anything. I obviously have the option of just not going and staying home but then I\u2019d be alone at a Christmas and for two weeks in January and I don\u2019t want that. I\u2019ve tried expressing how I feel about it and he just says I\u2019m being crazy. I\u2019m being told I\u2019m selfish bc I don\u2019t want to stay at their house  but I feel that I\u2019m not asking for a lot. I feel that he isn\u2019t even trying to do anything to make me comfortable bc he doesn\u2019t care.

None of this is acceptable. Four hours of sleep on a damn couch?  Trapped at your in-laws house for two weeks?  No, no, no. \n\nYou\u2019re only an asshole if you go through with this wedding. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You should probably make sure you've had open, honest, and thorough conversations about the role of his family in your lives before you get married.  Perceived tension between a person and their s/o's family is a great way to guarantee pain in the relationship.", "Your husband doesn\u2019t sound that great. I would definitely not be ok with that scenario. Especially twice in two months. Sleep matters.", "NTA\n\nSpending two weeks plus another few days at the holidays getting inadequate sleep by yourself on a sofa isn't the kind of restful vacation you deserve.\n\nEncourage your husband go on these trips without you.", "NTA, does he make a habit of not caring about your feelings and needs in other areas of your life, or is it just confined to holidays with his family?", "Well, you could get a hotel room and stay there yourself while he sleeps on the couch. That would also give you a place to yourself to decompress.  Don't expect everyone to be delighted about it though.\n\nNTA. You don't mention your own family; if they are not in your life for some reason, then your fianc\u00e9 may feel his family now \"gets\" all the holidays. Better figure that out before you actually get married.", "NTA. Sleeping on the couch would be the deal breaker for me. Visiting in-laws is rarely a good time but you need a place you can decompress and relax during that time. Not having a room/bed would be awful. I would keep insisting on the hotel idea.", "NTA but how do you think this is going to pan out if you marry this man? This is how your holidays will be from now on. Can you live like this? If not then you should not marry this guy.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 sounds very self absorbed or willfully neglectful. Or both.\n\nIt sounds like the fianc\u00e9 thinks he\u2019s right in this situation and to question him means you are the problem. Which is a very narcissistic viewpoint.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t listen to you/consider your feelings on this (with his family) you may need to really take a look at your relationship. Him wanting to stay/be at his family\u2019s house during holidays will most definitely be a yearly thing. Especially if you don\u2019t live close to them anymore.\n\nHe needs to be willing to take your feelings into consideration (honestly it should be of high priority to him to make sure you feel comfortable). He can\u2019t just say \u201cyou\u2019re crazy\u201d. That\u2019s not being in a relationship. That\u2019s being controlling.", "NTA. Get your own hotel room and rental and when you\u2019ve had enough of them retreat to your hotel. He can have the sofas no problem!", "OP you're definitely NTA, however this is going to be a recurring theme that he's going to be thrusting on you on a continuous basis if he's just now throwing out Christmas in a last-minute trip on top of 2 weeks the following month.  It's obvious he's very devoted to spending time with his family but you aren't, and calling you \"crazy\" isn't what a fianc\u00e9 does.  Sorry but people may think this is a compromise, but figuring out what to eat or what movie to see is a what couples compromise on.  Agreeing to be trapped with visiting in-laws you have no desire to be around is not a compromise but more coercion.", "NTA. But the big issue is your \u2018fianc\u00e9\u2019 who is not grown up enough to spend Christmas away from his parents. The 2 of you are supposed to make a new family. New traditions. He is not ready. For any adult, the 2 weeks in January should be more than enough!", "Jesus fuck, DO NOT MARRY HIM!!! Hooooly shit, this sounds like hell. NTA", "NTA. \n\nVacation doesn't mean going without sleep or having a place to decompress.  It's just the opposite, in fact. The person being selfish is your fiance for not listening to what you're saying, dismissing your feelings, and insisting on everything being the way he wants without compromise.  \n\nWelcome to your life moving forward if you go along with this.\n\nFor your own well-being being, stay home or go and book a room and rental car. Give yourself the option of having space and privacy to actually enjoy the holiday.", "You don\u2019t need sleep on vacation?  WTF?  Extra sleep is one of the big reasons I take vacations in the first place!  NTA", "Nta", "NTA. I wouldn't go for Christmas and then 2 weeks in January one or the other. Get a hotel and car even if he chooses to sleep on a couch, by night 3 he will want sleep. In a hotel you can sleep when you want and have a peaceful place to get ready.", "NTA, that is your fiance putting you into a sleep-deprived situation over the holidays with his family where you don't have a vehicle and you have no place to go decompress. Followed by, you have time scheduled off work in January, if he wants to go in December, let him go cause this is about him not about the two of you.  It's about him forcing you out of a level of comfort to make him (happy),.\n\nYour boundary and be firm with him.  I will do this for you but I'm getting a hotel so I can get sleep, I will not be there for four weeks like you want because of (X, Y, and Z) aka you don't want to waste all your vacation time.  He needs to know that you have boundaries and he needs to respect these boundaries.  The holidays are not just about his family but it should be about you as well, and he's making it like you aren't his family.  He's showing you what the holidays are going to be like with him.", "NTA.\n\nSince he's being so selfish, how about you go on the trip, get yourself a hotel and rental car, and that gives you a nice escape when it's time to turn in for the evening or you get overwhelmed by the chaos while he gets to spend all the time he wants with his family.", "You could remind him that it may be \"going home\" for him, but for you, it's a source of not being able to fully relax for the entire trip.\n\nBut I'm more worried that he's not listening to you when you say that something is a problem.\n\nNTA, and I don't know enough to say \"you can work through this\" or \"toss the whole man out.\" It mostly depends on whether he's like this all the time.", "This man is ignoring your reasonable request to get a hotel to *be able to sleep* during an extra family visit you don't want to go to anyway. Instead, he's calling you selfish and crazy. This man is on his best behavior right now. It won't get better after you get married. Think long and hard if you are ok with being disrespected by him like this for years. NTA", "NTA-can you just not go? Before we had kids, my spouse and I just spent holidays with out own families. I was annoyed because I was in the same situation. He wanted to \u201cparty\u201d with his family while I was stuck with no car. I told him I\u2019m okay if he wants to just be with them. Now with kids it gets a little hectic but enjoy your time without kids.", "You\u2019re right. He doesn\u2019t care. Girl RUN. If I had to see my in laws every holiday, sleep alone on a couch (oh wait, you don\u2019t need sleep) I would lose my mind. Your needs are not a priority to him, and that won\u2019t change when you get married. In fact, it will get worse once you\u2019re locked down. Do yourself a favor and break up with him. NTA in general but Y W B T A to yourself if you let him continue to treat you this way.", "NTA. These would be hard boundaries for me.  There\u2019s no where you can go that\u2019s your space when you\u2019re done for the evening.  Now you get to loiter awkwardly until the last person toddles off to their bed before you can make your couch bed.  \n\nThis sounds great on a long weekend when you haven\u2019t caught up in ages. Repeating this for 14 nights?  Oh, and you\u2019re trapped and dependent on his family if you\u2019d like to do something outside their house.  No thank you.  \n\nThis is hardly a \u201cvacation\u201d when you need a vacation from trip.", "NTA, but sometimes you have to 'give'.  Try and get a plan with him on how to schedule holidays in the future that both agree upon.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s understandable that you don\u2019t want to travel for Christmas, and understandable that he does. It\u2019s understandable that he\u2019d rather fly for a short visit than spend hours driving, and understandable that you\u2019d like to have a car for freedom while you\u2019re there. It\u2019s understandable that he\u2019s comfortable with the way things have always worked in his family, like sleeping on couches, and that you\u2019re not. It\u2019s understandable that he\u2019d want to stay in the thick of things in his family home, and that you\u2019d rather sleep separately and have your own space. I think you both need to think about real compromise. Your offer is that you accompany him but that he change all the parameters to defer to your comfort. His offer is that you opt out. He dismisses your discomfort with this arrangement. You dismiss his longing to be with his family. Neither is looking for a middle ground. If you can\u2019t navigate these conflicting wants and needs, you should not be getting married.", "The move is obviously a difficult adjustment for your husband. Hopefully this will wear off as he gets use to being so far away from his family. \n\nCan you compromise on this first holiday season? And tell him next year you want to do Christmas just the two of you? Or is it a hard pass for you?", "You have a few options, which include renting your own car (or Uber budget) and hotel room, or you visiting your own relatives while he visits his.  \n\nIf you want to spend the holiday with him I heartily recommend getting your own hotel room if you can afford it, because as you say, you won't be getting any sleep at the in-laws' house.  No, the fiancee won't like it, but if he's saying nonsense like \"You won't need sleep\", obviously you're going to have to ignore at least some of his wishes.", "Plus the even bigger problem- being called crazy for asking for reasonable compromises in an idiotic situation, and selfish for saying you don\u2019t want to stay in a house you can\u2019t sleep in properly.", "Four hours of sleep could be ok if OP was ok with it. The bigger issue is the fiance calling her crazy and selfish for objecting and offering a hotel as an alternative. And it's 2 weeks *plus* a few days Christmas visit! 2 trips! No no is right!", "I\u2019d actually be okay with the set up technically speaking\u2026I sleep fine on couches and run on little sleep, but I\u2019d still be pissed that someone thought that was an acceptable travel plan. That\u2019s an emergency situation/don\u2019t have money for a hotel sleeping situation, not a planned Christmas family trip."]}
