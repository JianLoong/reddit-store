I\u2019m sure some people will disagree with me, but in an apartment/condo situation, delivery to me means they arrive in the lobby. I meet all delivery people there, and unless they are delivering something like white glove delivery for furniture, I would never expect them to come to my actual unit. That being said, the delivery driver\u2019s response was completely unprofessional and over the top. \n\nYou, however, don\u2019t come off looking great either.

I think when you live in an apartment, and you order food it\u2019s not unreasonable for the driver to request the person to meet in the lobby since apartments can be confusing and he\u2019s not making that much money per trip. Guy shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you, but you should\u2019ve helped him out IMO.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s literally his fucking job.

Just cos you've paid money doesn't mean you can act like a dick.", "ESH \n\nI live in an apartment on the 1st floor and meet any deliveries at the front door of the apartment complex. If it is something heavy and/or many items, I might ask them to help me bring it/them up the stairs and then I tip. If they clearly look tired, sick or tell me they are not able to carry heavy items, I suck it up and do it myself. Even though my deliveries are usually noted as door delivery, I feel like what you did is abuse of the workers for the amount of money they get paid. Being incredibly nitpicky about which door they delivered to, when you as a person living on the 1st floor, will put more effort into your stubbornness and/or laziness arguing with the delivery person than getting your food. \n\nWhen you compare food deliveries to furniture deliveries - furniture is delivered to your home (even in apartment complexes) but you pay the delivery person more for each floor they have to go up to - you pay different for front door of the building, 1st floor, 2nd floor etc. You don't have that for food deliveries and it would be fair to assume deliver at door means front door of the building, not your apartment. \n\nThe delivery person shouldn't have yelled at you either. He can probably stop taking deliveries for your address and one of his colleagues is going to take your address next time, so he doesn't have to argue or yell to deal with the situation.", "ESH - I was an Uber eats driver (very short lived lol) I think he should have gone to your specific unit in the first place. But once you realized he wasn\u2019t you should have just ran downstairs.\n\nCould have all be avoided by using the notes/delivery instructions section properly.

It would've been common courtesy to AT LEAST reply and ask them to bring the order to your door. Stop being disrespectful and lazy, or maybe just pick up your own food next time. I will agree though that the reaction of the delivery person was extreme.", "After getting more context - ESH. You wanted them to meet at door (not leave it at door) yet ignored their messages. If you are meeting your driver you should be ready to respond, even if it's with \"Sorry can't come down, in the middle of something, please come to unit 1234\" You're not an asshole for not going downstairs but you are for leaving them hanging when they're supposed to meet you. If it were just a leave at my door with clear instructions it would be NTA. \n\nINFO - Did you have it delivered as hand it to me, or was it delivered as leave it at door?

Or do they need to walk to the right door?", "Uber usually has multiple selected delivery methods of your choice just for this for no extra cost. You can select.

OP was %100 in the right.", "nah OP is the asshole. ten year sf resident and if you\u2019re in a city getting uber eats to your apartment yta if you make them come inside. door of the building is typical but meeting them at the curb shows respect for their time.", "You can edit your judgment by adding \"EDIT\"", "Oh,  that's why I'm so confused! I keep getting Doordash recommended on reddit as well and they're unanimous in saying that delivery means to the door,  not to the lobby.", "I personally always go down to the lobby to greet the delivery people. Not saying anyone needs to do that, but it\u2019s what makes me more comfortable, and what makes sense to me. I live in a building with two separate locked entries, and it\u2019s just easier that way.", "I would expect the handover to happen at the apartment building door, personally. It doesn't seem right to buzz strangers into a shared building.", "> Delivery people sign in at the lobby and are then let up to the individual apartments via a special elevator for those deliveries.\n\nThis situation is entirely different than OP\u2019s. OP chose to ignore multiple text messages letting them know the food was there. In a building where someone has to sign in and is then directed to a special elevator for delivery, no one is going to be ignoring the driver and wasting their time. Even if the driver chose not to go directly to the unit, they could feasibly leave it with the person at the check in desk. \n\nThe driver\u2019s behavior was not cool, but OP ignoring them because they couldn\u2019t be bothered is not cool either.\n\nAlso, I disagree with your assessment that most people here are arguing YTA don\u2019t live in apartments. I own a condo and I own a house, and prior to owning those, I lived in apartments once I moved away to college and after. It sounds like everyone here arguing YTA does or has lived in an apartment to me, at least at some point (the average person has at one point or another anyways).\n\nI stand by the ESH vote. They can report the driver for the yelling, but in no way is it acceptable to ignore multiple text messages from the driver because you can\u2019t be bothered to respond.", "The fucking point of ordering in is that you don\u2019t need to leave the house.", "This baffles me, deliveries to my apartment have always been brought to the door *of the unit*, not the building's front door.\n\nEdit: now that I think about this more, I've never lived in a building that had a lobby, the management office has always been its own separate thing and the apartment building doors opened directly onto stairwells leading to the units.", "The front door is the door to his apartment, not the door for the apartment complex.", "Well call me poor but I\u2019ve never lived in an apartment where my building had a lobby.  Most didn\u2019t even have an outer door (just a breezeway).  I guess in those cases you could meet them outside the building but if I\u2019m going to do that I\u2019m going to just get in my car and go pick the food up myself.", "Agreed. Where I am, it used to be standard for delivery to come right to your door in a building but it changed during the panini, and now it's typically considered polite to go meet them in the lobby instead. Delivery folks, especially those working for a service like UberEats, are getting paid very little and deserve a good tip and some common courtesy for the service they are rendering.\n\nObviously, in this case the driver was being very unprofessional in his response. However, I no longer expect delivery to come to my apartment door and I go to the lobby.", "Delivery driver\u2019s behavior was not at all appropriate, but OP says they live on the first floor. Where I am that means the ground floor, but presumably where they are it means the floor above the lobby. I would never even consider not going down the lobby over one story in a building, but that\u2019s just me. \n\nEither way, for me this is an ESH situation. Driver\u2019s behavior was unprofessional and unacceptable, but OP ignoring multiple messages from their delivery person because they weren\u2019t getting their way and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to deal with that\u201d is ridiculous behavior too.", "I order delivery all the time and I am paying for it to be delivered to my unit door lol.

I've just reread the end part of the original thread & the uber eats guy definitely was an ass for shouting through the building, disturbing/scaring everyone around.\n\n\nSounds like he was in a really bad mood, not that it makes it ok.", "The fucking point of ordering is to not have to cook. If you live in an apartment building, you can lift your lazy ass off your armchair to go fetch your delivery from the front door.", "Clearly people have very different (and very strong) opinions about this. Neither is necessarily wrong (people have different expectations). However, OP ignoring multiple texts from the delivery driver \u201cbecause they couldn\u2019t be bothered\u201d is what firmly pushes them into being an AH in addition to the driver being one for their unhinged behavior.\n\nIf the driver could not get in the building without OP buzzing them up, in what way is ignoring their messages going to solve the issue? According to OP they had said they would buzz them up, but as someone who orders a lot of delivery, even though I meet them in the lobby, I oftentimes find the drivers don\u2019t get or see my instructions (my building is sort of hidden and for some hard to find and I leave explicit instructions to make sure they can). All OP had to do was respond when the delivery guy said he was there and say hey, can you press number whatever on the box and I\u2019ll buzz you up.\n\nAs for being willing to go get in the car and get your food because you would have to step out into the breezeway\u2014 that\u2019s 100% your choice. For me going down to the lobby and meeting a delivery driver is still a whole lot simpler than getting ready, getting the car out of the garage or taking public transportation if I don\u2019t feel like driving), commuting anywhere from 5-45 minutes to pick up my food and bring it home. That\u2019s a personal choice though. \n\nI\u2019m paying them to alleviate the hassle of having to go and do all of that. Just my thoughts.", "I\u2019m in nyc and while delivering directly to the unit door is the norm here (especially when there is no doorman) the pandemic had the opposite impact. Now they just leave your delivery in front of your door, knock and walk away. Meeting them in the lobby seems the least covid friendly option? I\u2019m not sure I understand that logic.", "I feel like I\u2019m taking crazy pills reading these responses.  I tip 20-30% and expect them to drop it at my door.  Otherwise I would just do pick up.  \nI am paying him to deliver it to me. My mailman doesn\u2019t dump all the mail at the lobby, my Amazon guy doesn\u2019t, my Instacart people dont. I\u2019m paying for a service. \n\nWhen they make me come to the lobby doors to pick up my order I drop tip value down to reflect it.
