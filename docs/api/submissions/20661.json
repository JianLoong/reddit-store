This makes it seem like they have different households.\n\nI\u2019m also going to point out something knowing it\u2019s not fair. If your mother is known for doing this, if she has trouble scheduling or making abstract work pans for the future, then you need to start planning with that in mind. You need to start telling your mother an exact date and time you want to go to get something and remind her of what you are doing. You need to start taking on more responsibility not just for your needs but for how to make sure your mother will follow through for you.\n\nBy \u201cneed,\u201d I mean this is sometimes you need to do for yourself so you can have what you need and be prepared, as it one of the few things you can do to help the process. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s not fair. You as a child shouldn\u2019t have to help manage your mother\u2019s time. *She* should be teaching *you.* However, it is unfortunately one of the ways you can deal with this situation and benefit yourself until you can take over your own plans completely.", "YTA, people are not on your schedule, you don't need them today.

I lost my tie and had to get a permission slip to say I didn't have my tie that day. Dress shoes, black trousers, white shirt, and tie. Anything else and you were sent home. Regular clothes? No chance. And to be clear this was a state school. And not even a very good one. At least I left before they brought in blazers.

I think it\u2019s because she already took on the responsibility to go and buy them so he thinks that she needs to be the one to do it, not him(in my opinion that is)\n\nI have 3 polo shirts and 2 pants. The reason why I need more clothes is that because if I washed them, there is always a chance that could rain which could prolong the day they can become completely dry which can result in me wearing regular clothing and I assure you my school does not like it when students wear regular clothing and it\u2019s not like we have a dryer at home or even a drying store nearby where we can dry them.", "Why would she need a textbook today, when school doesn't start for several more weeks?", "No, she is worried she will have to, the post does not say she had to borrow a book from someone else.
