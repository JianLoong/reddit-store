Tim has a daughter, \u201cLucy\u201d (13F) from a one night stand. Both Tim and Lucy\u2019s mother \u201cDebra\u201d were teenagers when Lucy was born, Debra wanted nothing to do with Lucy and disappeared so Tim had full custody and been raising Lucy as a single dad when we met. I\u2019ve been in Lucy\u2019s life since she was 6 and consider her my own. \n\n\r  \nA couple years ago, Debra suddenly appeared back in our lives and contacted Tim wanting to meet with Lucy. Debra was a drug addict (Im not sure if she still is but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised) and generally not a great person to for a kid to be around, but Tim would allow Lucy to see Debra once in a while. Lucy seems like she\u2019s just going through the motions with finally having her mother in life, she doesn\u2019t particularly seem excited or upset, she just do as she is told. Debra also has a boyfriend \u201cDon\u201d. Recently, after Lucy came back home from dinner with Debra and Don, she mentioned to Tim and I that she found Don very weird. He didn\u2019t explicitly say or do anything to Lucy, but she felt uncomfortable being around him. \n\n\r  \nA few days ago, Tim had to unexpected go on a work trip to another country where he will be completely unavailable for three days. He wont have any type of service to communicate with us. That trip also happens to coincide on the same time as when Tim and Debra agreed that Lucy can spend a night at Debra\u2019s. So I was the one dropping Lucy off at Debra\u2019s and when we got there, we saw Don sitting on the front porch staring out at our car. I looked at Lucy seeing if she still wants to even go in, and by the look on her face, I asked her if she wanted to go to get ice cream at Downtown Disney instead (we live near Disneyland and DT Disney is the shopping area right outside the park). She immediately said yes, so I got out of the car and told Debra that Lucy doesn\u2019t want to do dinner anymore and I\u2019m taking her to Downtown Disney for ice cream. Debra started screaming at me saying I am a nobody trying to bribe her daughter with ice cream so she doesn\u2019t want to spend dinner with her own mother anymore. I told her Lucy doesn\u2019t want to go in and I won't force her. Debra responded that Tim had agreed to Lucy spending the night at hers and the matter is between her and Tim, I shouldn\u2019t be involved or make decisions because I am not Lucy\u2019s mother. That made me really mad so I hopped back in my car and drove Lucy to DT Disney, we actually ended up going to Disneyland as well for the rest of the day. Debra has been spamming my phone calling me all sorts of name for not forcing Lucy to spend the night at hers, and Tim is still unavailable and can't be reached for a comment.

If you would have said \"do you want to go home\" Lucy would have jumped on that too. \n\nGuy gave her the creeps and bio mom doesn't seem to care. Personally if Debra cares that much about seeing her daughter she can go to court and get the rights especially since Lucy doesn't seem to want to go.", "NTA.... always listen to that weird feeling.", "Nta. Do you have Don\u2019s last name?  You should check his criminal history and any sex offender registries.", "NTA. Your step daughter told you she got a weird feeling for the boyfriend and wasn\u2019t comfortable being around him. Your reaction was valid and I would have done the same thing. I would have framed it differently however. Maybe instead of asking if she wanted ice-cream ask her if she was comfortable staying the night at her mom\u2019s.

She has known you longer than her bio mom.", "NTA.  If the kid doesn't want to be in that house, you don't make her go in the house.  She was uncomfortable about the bf already and the mom's reaction made me completely agree that you are NOT the AH here. Thank you for protecting your daughter.", "You responded to your step-daughter's clear anxiety upon seeing Don and her desire not to enter a house with him or to walk past him.\n\nI would like to strongly recommend that Tim talk with his lawyer and that Debra's continued visitation with Lucy be supervised and involve pre-testing for drugs and alcohol if those are ongoing concerns.\n\nIt might also be smart to get Lucy to a play therapist who can perhaps unpack what the heck is going on with Don, whose criminal record should also be checked out.\n\nDo not send Lucy back there.  \n\nNTA.  In fact, you get the Mama Bear Award!", "NTA. You trusted your gut and protected the child. However, you handled this with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.", "Nta.  Better safe than sorry.  \n\nForewarn your husband asap.", "NTA. A 13-year-old is old enough to make decisions regarding this situation and if her gut instinct was telling her something was wrong then you were absolutely right to support her in that decision.", "NTA\n\nWish my best friend had had a stepmom like you. Hers cheerfully dropped her off to be molested even when she begged not to go back and then convinced her dad to move to a different state without his kid.", "This is just my woman\u2019s intuition speaking but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to be around Don, overnight. I don\u2019t know how long Debra hasn\u2019t gotten to know Lucy and how invested she is about being a mother to Lucy given she was gone for majority of her life.

You are accountable for your child, that you raised, and just like any caring parent you want to protect your child from any evil out there.

It was meant as a comfort gesture, and I think it was taken that way.  Lucy is 13, not 3, and the ice cream was not some sort of special, now-or-never treat.  It sounds like it's a pretty regular thing.  If she had wanted to go with her bio-mom, it wouldn't have dissuaded her. She knew that there would still be ice cream in her future.", "Debra is Lucy's biological parent, but you're her mother. You felt something was off, trusted your gut and daughter, and left. NTA", "NTA you listened to your daughter (you are her mother, Debra can be considered an egg donor).", "NTA. First of all you are her mother and you are doing what's best for her.

Listen to your gut and your stepdaughter's gut!", "NTA.  Your daughter -- YOURS -- is uncomfortable around her boyfriend.  That's nature's warning bell.  She should certainly not be forced into an unsupervised visit with such a person.  The fact that Debra responded that way proves that she is unfit.  Your job is to protect you daughter and you're doing it.", "What kid wouldn\u2019t choose ice cream and Disney over a visit to a mom she barely knows and her weird new boyfriend? What bio-mom wouldn\u2019t get upset that her daughter\u2019s stepmom was taking her for ice cream instead of dropping her off for a  agreed-upon visit?\n\nNTA for protecting Lucy when she was uncomfortable but the way you handled it was just not okay.", "Ultimately NTA.  If there are bad vibes and you're not feeling it, and your kid is not feeling it then its fine to end it--better to be safe than sorry.  However, it seems manipulative to offer ice cream to your kid rather than just asking her if she wanted to see her mother.  I am not sure any kid at that age would be like \"no, I don't want ice cream.\"  Other than that though I think you acted within reason given the circumstances.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You (smartly) gave Lucy a choice in a situation she was obviously uncomfortable with and were will to be painted as the bad guy to take the pressure off of her. That's what good parents and people who are worried about the best interest of a child do. Tim left her with you, not Debra. Things and plans change and Debra of all people should realize that as she abandoned her daughter for 10ish years then changed her mind.  \n\n\nI am curious if Debra had any interest in Lucy before she met Don or is dating him when her interest started? Anyway it goes, he makes Lucy uncomfortable and there's no real reason for her to be around him if she'd rather not. Debra is in no position to be making demands and I hope Tim informs her of that when he returns.   \n\n\nAlso, consider making a 'safe word or phrase' that Lucy can use to let you and her dad know she wants out of a situation. You can play bad guy or make up an excuse to get her out of it without her explicitly stating she wants out. Something others might not think too much of, but will be distinctly noticeable to the both of you. I did this with my kids and trust me, it gets used. Don't feel comfortable at the sleep over anymore? \\*codeword\\* in a random message and suddenly mom's pissed because she didn't realize you hadn't cleaned your room and you have to come home now. Lucy doesn't lose face with her friends and gets out of the uncomfortable situation. It's a lifesaver for teens.", "NTA and if she really wanted to see her kid, she could go along for ice cream surely? Why does she need to be alone with her and Don?", "NTA. If that child senses something off about the situation, you are doing the right thing by listening to and protecting her.\n\nAnd of note, as a child development professiobal, \"mom's boyfriend\" are two words I am very, very skeptical, critical, and hypervigilant about. I have put a few \"mom's boyfriend\" types in prison for their actions.\n\nGood on you.", "NTA - so often we get taught not to listen to our hind brain which in this situation is yelling \"danger danger\".

If not, look into it to protect you all.", "This is a tricky one. NTA for wanting to do right by Lucy. Soft YTA for holding out the offer of ice cream to sway her decision. Debra is a huge AH for abandoning Lucy and then waltzing back into her life at this late date and expecting to be a mother to her.\n\nNow that Debra is back in Lucy's life, there needs to be a formal custody agreement in place; possibly one that asserts Lucy won't visit her mother if Don is there. And Debra should be paying child support at the least.\n\nFinally, Debra's whole \"you're not her mother. You shouldn't be involved in decisions\" is too absurd to even respond to. You've been actively involved in raising Lucy since she was little, unlike Debra who is just the egg donor. You're her real mother for all intents and purposes. Keep acting in Lucy's best interest and don't sweat Debra's drama.", "You did the right thing by asking Lucy if she felt uncomfortable. But it should have been a simple question, without the option of ice cream/ Disney. \n\nAnd then telling Debra about going for ice cream instead was poor judgment.  It\u2019s always advisable to keep things simple and not add unnecessary detail, especially in this case. It was unnecessarily inflammatory. The less said the better.

Really? That's super un-cool and 'in-your-face' to the mom.\n\nI wonder what Lucy would have said you left it as 'are you ok to still go for dinner or did you want to come back home with me?'

You need to cut that behavior out, because if that continues and if mom is smart she can file a motion based on you gatekeeping her contact to the child and negatively impacting her relationship to her - which already sucks if a bio parent is doing it to the other, but which I find even more outrageous by a stepparent.", "ESH no question Debra and creepy bf are AH but you are one as well. You did the right thing by not forcing her to go and supporting her but you MAJORLY screwed up and potentially seriously damaged your husband\u2019s position if he has to fight her over visitation because of where you took her.

Maybe she won't. You respecting her wishes makes her know she can trust you, and that's the most important thing. You're doing great!!", "Update me", "NTA. Your step daughter and you are creeped out by the boyfriend. If her dad was a phone call and a short ride away, sure. But as it is? No. They can reschedule.", "NTA - don't let that man NEAR her, if she feels uncomfortable in any way then listen to that. also you helped raise Lucy, she is more your daughter then hers. just because she birthed Lucy does not mean she is entitled to her. she's a person, not an object", "Absolutely NTA. I applaud you for standing up for your stepdaughter and valuing her opinion, although I probably wouldn\u2019t have said you were going to get ice cream instead. When Dad is back in town he needs to have a conversation with bio mom and let her know that boyfriend makes their daughter uncomfortable and in the future if bio mom wants to see daughter and spend time with her then boyfriend needs to get lost.", "NTA. You did the right thing trusting Lucy\u2019s gut feeling", "NTA -13 is old enough for her to pick ice cream over that. Plus children should not be around street drug use so it\u2019s better to keep her away unless the mom agrees to drug testing and the successful completion of a rehab program.\n\nEdit: single word", "NTA\n\nI'm surprised that Debra's legal rights haven't been terminated. Then you could adopt Lucy.", "Information: was Debra made aware of how Lucy feels? Did Tim agree to Lucy to staying over with Debra while he was gone?", "Nta. Debra may have given birth to lucy but she is not her mother and lucy\u2019s pace need to be respected here. You made a call based on her reaction and I think its best to err on the side of caution. Explain everything to tim and raise the flag on Don. If lucy doesnt feel safe around him she shouldnt be around him - I would talk to tim about having custody stipulated and visitation regulated in court to make sure debra is not doing drugs anymore and that she knows that she isnt in charge", "NTA.\n\nYou trusted your gut and protected Lucy in the only way you thought you could. The only thing I would have done differently is not mention the ice cream.", "NTA! When anyone (especially a child) feels uncomfortable around anyone, you HAVE to respect that gut feeling. You did the right thing, OP! I would definitely discuss it with your husband when he gets home. And please tell Lucy that she\u2019s brave to speak up and say she\u2019s uncomfortable with someone or some situation and that you\u2019re very so happy she did. Remind her to always trust her gut like that and that you will always be there to support her and get her out of those situations.", ">My Husband \u201cTim\u201d (34M) ... has a daughter, \u201cLucy\u201d (13F) from a one night stand.

I have seen this kind of thing go so bad so fast without some kind of legal precedent in place. Kidnapping, abduction, manipulation, abuse, exposure... it never ends well. Visiting Debra should really be up to Lucy, and maybe get a therapist opinion in this, and structured heavily by her father on what is allowed and what kind of visits and Lucy  being fully aware that she can refuse and say no at any time no questions asked. \n\nYou did that absolute right thing!!", "Never anything wrong with \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d in a situation like this. In the moment, without your husband available to consult, you took the lead from the girl herself and listened to her. \n\nBy all means discuss this with husband asap when he gets back and then both of you or just he needs to talk to Lucy to get details on how/why she in uncomfortable. To be sure so you\u2019re all on the same page going forward. But you\u2019re pretty much the opposite of the evil stepmother here. \n\nI\u2019d rather have mom pissed at me and even husband annoyed at drama (I\u2019m really hoping that\u2019s not his reaction though!) than have a young girl feel she couldn\u2019t trust me with her feelings. Her comfort & safety needs to come first. And it did. Lucy seems like a lucky girl.", "Bad vibes, No custody agreement? No way she\u2019s going over there!", "NTA, but info: Does Tim legally have full custody over Lucy? I would double check juuuuust in case, since this may get ugly if he doesn't. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but Don certainly doesn't sound like the most savory person. If Lucy doesn't want to be there, then it's best not to force her. You made the right call.", "If your child tells you that they are uncomfortable around a particular adult, you listen to them.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  Keep protecting Lucy.\n\nYou're a good mother OP.\n\nNTA.", "The girl is old enough to express herself and what she says and thinks should be respected. Dad needs to set some firm boundaries.

If it ever comes to that, the child\u2019s interests should come before all others.", "You're NTA but God, \"do you wanna see your mom or go to ice cream\" is not how you should have handled that. \"Do you want to still go or would you rather spend the weekend with me?\" is the correct way to word it. Or at least just tell the mom that plans have changed without mentioning ice cream. And then you could still go to Disney after you leave. You did the right thing, but if you'll be dealing with an argumentative coparent you need to learn how word things a little better to avoid accusations in the future as best you can. You need to play a perfect game so any shit she says about you will need to be made up, don't give her material.", "When I was around three, we had a neighbor who was a youngish man, probably early 30\u2019s, very clean, quiet, always dressed like Mr Rogers. \n\nI can\u2019t remember if he ever babysat me or not, but my mother and I both recall clearly that one day I told her \u201cdon\u2019t leave me alone with him.\u201d\n\nWhen I was maybe 6 or 7, I told my father that his best friend made me uncomfortable. \n\n\nYou who never molested me?

She is 13 and it sounds like Tim is making decisions for her. Before ANY visitation happens he should be talking to her and seeing what she wants. Lucy\u2019s opinion matters most here and it\u2019s sad that Tim isn\u2019t including the most important person in the decision making process.", "She bribed her with ice cream at Disneyland.", "Yeah, I dont think OP did anything wrong but she did set herself up for more difficulties by mentioning the ice cream. I wouldn't have even mentioned the ice cream option to the daughter until after she made her decision to go to bio moms just to avoid any potential accusations of manipulation, just in case the ice cream thing slipped later. Still would have offered ice cream after the decision was made but.", "I think a court would be more likely to terminate her rights than give her any legal rights. She deserted her daughter for 10 or 11 years. Paid no child support. (And if she's legally has the rights of a mother, then Tim could demand 10 years of child support.) Has a history of drug abuse.", "This needs to be higher. BACKGROUND CHECK ON DON IMMEDIATELY. PI That shit.", "I was coming here to say this! Also, I would check on bio mom\u2019s background as well. You never know! \n\nI would also talk to the police about that Don person. It sounds like the daughter is scared of him, something is setting her off. Mom is pushing way too hard about the visit as well. All my red flags are at full mast waving as hard as they can.", "At least only I didn't think of this", "Do you really think a teenager can be swayed by an ice cream cone. Yeah, I can get my kids to do just about anything for ice cream, but they're 5 and 3. Lucy is 13. Ice cream isn't the best thing ever to her. You're acting like she's a fucking toddler.", "did you miss the part where the bio mom literally abandoned her baby and Lucy didn't even meet her till recently? Debra being the bio mother doesn't mean sh\\*t, she lost her rights to be Lucy's mom when she RAN from her right after she was born.\n\nOP has been Lucy's mom since Lucy was 6, she helped raised her and has been in her life for years more then Debra. just because Debra birthed Lucy doesn't mean she is entitled to her. Lucy is a person, not an object, and as a person LUCY was not comfortable being alone with her estranged drug addict bio mother and creepy boyfriend.", "Debra disappeared for 13 years. She likely has no parental rights at this point. Even if her rights haven't been terminated, no judge is going to believe parental alienation after this woman just noped out for the girl's entire life up to this point.", "The sad thing is, we don't know if he didn't.\n\nDebra could have been trying to manipulate the situation with a \"see it was fine\" thing. \n\nI'm so glad OP has kiddo's back on this. I am SO so glad.", "Being that mom is so married to the idea of her young daughter spending time with an unrelated man (who may or may not have a drug problem) she wouldn\u2019t listen to her daughter if she had an issue either.  I can\u2019t imagine doing anything other than what OP did and since mom has no legal rights OP made the absolutely best decision and I\u2019m guessing dad will agree.", "It makes memwonder if debra would not return jid if tim was ooc \nI think tim and op need to  decide to allow op to adopt the sd and give nore legal stuff if something happens to tim", "This. Mine went for a sleepover with a friend and called me at 9 pm asking to be picked up. I was there in 15 minutes - no questions asked. Turns out friend's mom had two male guests who insisted on watching slasher movies, with two 7-year-olds in the room. Listen to your kids - they're like dogs. They KNOW HOW TO READ PEOPLE.", "Correction - she comforted and distracted Lucy with ice cream & Disney amusement park. Lucy didn't need to be bribed.", "NTA. In all the ways that matter, OP is the kiddo's mom.\n\nDebra can pound sand.", "Because, if Debra tells her version of this to an impartial court, it sounds EXACTLY like OP was bribing her daughter.\n\nIt also gives Debra ammunition to manipulate and blast the kid later, out of adult hearing. Never give someone like that ammunition or any unnecessary information. Going for ice cream instead of taking the kid to an arranged visit is COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY info.", "Not subtle in the sense of not hurting anyone's feelings. She got out of the car to talk to unstable and untrustworthy people. She told them where she was going. She antagonized them. This was not safe.", "She wouldn\u2019t if she hasn\u2019t already. Debra has no idea that she\u2019s a terrible excuse for a mother. Living in la-la land!", "No but it is ammunition for the mother to claim it was, especially because OP told her upfront but I'd have avoided it just in case it came up somehow later by accident too.", "That\u2019s all just Blabla - yes, bio-mom was out of the picture and now returned into the picture. Also stepmom was around for six years, not ever since the child was born or something like that, so let\u2019s cool it with \u201cshe is the real mom\u201d.\n\nNone of that matters; the point is: the actual parents of that child made an agreement and stepmom took it on to herself to do something totally different, without even as much as checking in with either of the actual parents - and on top of it in such a weird territory defending way. That\u2019s a crossing of boundaries and absolutely not acceptable.\n\nAlso imo she plays up the child\u2019s comments about not having been comfortable with stepdad, because she feels threatened by suddenly bio mom trying to return into the kids life; why else all the theatrics of knocking on her door and letting her know that the child rather wants ice cream with her than dinner with her bio-mom? That was petty pissing on the ground to defend her territory, not protecting the child of an alleged perp - for that a text message \u201cchild does not feel well, dad will contact you to reschedule\u201d would have sufficed.", "You must not have much experience in family court, let\u2019s go over how the facts could look like in court as presented by Debra . Debra has been making effort for reunification with the father\u2019s support and when op was told by the father to drop off the child op offered to take the child for ice cream and Disney world (op can say it wasn\u2019t planned but it doesn\u2019t look good). If you don\u2019t think this would weaken the father\u2019s position in any custody or visitation case then you are just blind to how the world works.  Op should have driven the daughter home and not done anything that could be considered as a reward or bribe.", "Don could be a predator for crying out loud. So glad OP followed Lucy\u2019s wishes!! I remember being her age and feeling obligated to be polite to creepy men from church. These days we know better because society has seen predators come out of all kinds of unexpected places and a drug addict\u2019s house is a red flag all by itself.", "Excuse me?", "Gunna use that one next time a cop pulls me over", "Even if she did end up taking the kid to ice cream and then Disney, OP could have done those things without offering them upfront as part of the choice.", "Yeah throwing in Debra's face was a questionable choice. I'm 100% with you there. But wouldn't consider a child giving in to an uncomfortable potentially dangerous situation on par with giving in to ice cream and Disneyland. Yeah OP created extra drama, but I wonder if it was an attempt (maybe misguided) to steer any backlash at her and not the 13 year old.", "Unless \nTim amd debra did this legally if something happened to tim or hes not there  debra could easily get custody or make a fuss", "I'm not sure what you mean in this context. The biological mother does not have legal custody of Lucy. Also when a girl/woman feels a man is creepy, she has to be allowed protection. There are no authority figures involved in this case. \nIt's only bribery if Lucy *wanted* to visit her biological, noncustodial mother.", "I know an addict very well. He has been clean and sober for about 5 years now. When he is using, he acts just like the mom is acting. Having a meltdown when things don\u2019t go as planned. Overreacting when he doesn\u2019t get his way and so on. He\u2019s not the only addict I have seen act like that. I even turned one into her PO because of that behavior. She got revoked. \n\nMy son is the first addict I described. He now has his life together and absolutely no longer wants to go down that path again. He also knows that every day he has to acknowledge that and make sure he has his stuff in order to stay clean and sober. That is how he does it. All it will take is for one time. \n\nAddict behavior is almost always the same though. It\u2019s that entitled, selfish, nasty, awful behavior. If biomom\u2019s behavior is any indication, she is most definitely using again.", "Have you ever talked to some kids who are in the foster system? Read about some of the trauma their addiction parents have put them through just for their next fix? Or how about human trafficking? Parents have sold kids into trafficking to get money for drugs. \nIt is not far fetched it is not fucked up to jump to that conclusion. Quite frankly, I honestly wish I didn\u2019t know about those things and could think what you did. \n\nMy heart will forever ache for those kids who were betrayed by the very people who were supposed to keep them safe."]}
