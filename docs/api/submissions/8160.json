We haven\u2019t talked in 2 years so obviously no one told me about my invite even if I was invited.\nPlus, I haven\u2019t lived at home in 8 years - and I\u2019ve moved to 2 different major cities in that time. \n\nSo this is where I might\u2019ve been the AH. I said that I was never actually invited to the wedding. No one asked me where my address was and I\u2019m not just going to ask Kyle where my invite went and risk inviting myself to the wedding. If he really wanted me there, he would\u2019ve made an effort to contact me himself, therefore I was never actually invited and I won\u2019t be attending. She left me on read and I never heard from them on Christmas. \n\nSome of my friends understand but others think I\u2019m being stubborn and the groom may have been to busy to worry about my invite.

I would apologize to your cousin for not goings and say you didn't know he wanted you there.", "NTA- they know you don't speak to your parents, and a month before hand they found out you never received an invite.  If Kyle had wanted you there, he should have personally called you, apologized for not having your address correct, and asked you if you could attend.  It is a phone call that would take a few minutes.  \n\nYour family sucks for ignoring you over this, this is a situation they created.", "INFO What did Kyle's sister say when you told her that? Does Kyle have your number?", "NTA, the sister obviously has your number. Why didn't they just ask for your adress? I would assume I wasn't invited either. You find out the adress, it's ridiculous to send your invite to your parents house.", "NTA.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, your presence was not important to the wedding - at least not to your cousin. If he really wanted you there, he'd have put the minimal effort into actually inviting you. As it was, it sounds like he sent a \"familial obligation\" invitation out without caring if it got to you.\n\nIf it wasn't important enough to him, why should it be that important to you?\n\nSounds like you're not close. I'd say N-A-H normally, but anyone giving you grief over not showing up is certainly being an asshole.", "Nta if she really wanted to go she would of sent a text(that way always had address) hey OP I'm getting married and doing invites can I have your address\" 2 seconds", "I think you don't care what they think. And that's your decision to make. NTA.", "Whether intentionally or by accident they tried to manipulate you into talking to your parents. \n\nNTA for holding up your boundaries , but a month before the wedding when other cousin texted, you could\u2019ve given your new address and asked for an invite.", "NTA \n\nThey know you are an adult living separately. The invitation should go to you or you are not invited. Plus they know you were estranged from your parents. So truthfully they did not send you an invitation since it was sent to your parents and not you. \n\nWas this their way of trying to force y\u2019all to communicate?", "NAH, but I think you were being a bit stubborn about it. Keeping track of addresses is hard and it could have been an accident. They reached out to confirm when they didn't hear from you.  Could have been handled differently.", "NTA\n\nI agree that you weren't technically invited to the wedding. Family members obviously know how to contact you, so they could have easily gotten your address to ensure that you received an invitation.\n\nSending it to the house if your estranged parent is a sure way to ensure that you don't know about the invitation and don't attend.", "Part of the wedding process is obtaining physical mailing addresses. Clearly you have contact with family, and I\u2019m guessing they have your phone number. All it would have taken is a text to get your address for the invite. \n\nNTA. They\u2019re purposefully being obtuse and obstinate.", "YTA. It was made clear to you by your other cousin that you were invited, so claiming you weren't is just a lie, period. You admit that you have lived in multiple cities in the last 8 years and Kyle might have a lot on his plate, hence not having the correct address to send your invitation to.\n\n~~Info: Is the address on your invitation the sole reason you didn't go? As in, would you have gone if the invite arrived in your own mailbox?~~", "YTA, gently. Honestly, I see where you're coming from, but I wonder if the reason was not as malicious as you think. Tracking down every relative is a pain in the ass. A lot of couples find it easier to send one blanket invitation to the \"family\" and expect it gets disseminated from there. Your relationship with your parents aside, you did say you moved around a lot.  I agree with the sister. You were invited, and you're being stubborn. She literally just told you that you are invited. Take that at face value.", "Proof positive that cousins can be Flying Monkeys too. NTA", "NTA. This feels like a lazy gift grab. Include you on the invite list, and then don\u2019t mention not getting an RSVP until a month before, all while attempting to force you and your parents to reconnect. Or, they were legit busy and didn\u2019t consider your situation, completely plausible when planning a wedding. If you wish, extend an olive branch by sending a gift. Their reaction will tell you everything you need to know. Not sure what happened between you and your parents, but not letting you know is something most families would disagree with, your parents may have told a different story to the newleyweds.", "YTA - if you wanted to go, just go. If you want to cause a problem, then you did fine.", "INFO how far is the wedding from where you're located?\n\nYTA if you live nearby. You sound like you're fairly transient so tracking down your address may be a pain and it would be easier for the cousin to include you with the family's invitation - estranged or not. They also messaged you a month out, clearly indicating you're invited, so your reasoning for not attending because you 'didn't receive an invitation' is petty.\n\nNTA if you live across the country and making arrangements like that a month out is costly and impractical. \n\nAt the end of the day, if the sole reason you didn't attend is because you didn't get a formal invitation in the mail, then you need to get over yourself.", "YTA. If you don't want to go cause your estranged parents are there, that's understandable. But sulking cause the groom took the easy way out makes you just... sad. His sister likely called you to make up for the error but now you're choosing to be petty.", "ESH\n\nLife doesn't revolve around you, just go to the wedding sheesh.  Maybe they were super busy and didn't have time to find your address?  On the other hand, they too could have put in some more effort to find your address and make sure you were invited.\n\nUnless you really want to be estranged from that part of the family too, I would say go to the wedding, UNLESS you hate weddings, then skip it.", "YTA\n\nWedding planning is busy. They fucked up, but assuming it was a mistake with no malicious intent, your response is rude.\n\nMake sure you're not mistaking intentional ignoring for just genuinely not wanting to talk to you.", "YTA I was opposite until I reread . Yes you don\u2019t have to attend and yes they made a mistake sending to your mother \n\nBut you could easily asked her details when she said you were invited  but you were being petty and punishing them for sending the invite to your mother and frankly If your post is what you wrote on the message it does come across as rude aswell . I would have left you on read too.\n\nWhat you should have done was remind her that you are NC with your mother and now that you were told  with 1 month notice , it was too little notice and could not attend.", "YTA. I don't know most of my cousins addresses. If I was sending out invites and needed my cousin's address, I would ask my mom who would ask my aunt etc. and whatever address made its way back to me would be added to a list with a lot of other addresses. I wouldn't stop and read each address and be like \"oh wait, I think she's not talking to her parents and this looks like her parents' address, let's double check this one\" because I'd be too busy planning a fucking wedding. \n\nYou could've just said \"can you check with Kyle and make sure I'm invited?\" when his sister texted you, instead of going off on her with your \"if they really wanted me there they would've made an effort\" whining. \n\nIf I'm planning a wedding and that's the response I got, I would think \"fuck it, I don't have time to soothe her ego right now\" and move on. Because the wedding isn't about YOU, it's about the people getting married.", "YTA your cousin knows you're estranged from your parents but doesn't know your address, who's fault is that? They've never been to your home?", "NTA.  Your family needs to send you invitations at your home.", "YTA. You knew you were invited. You didn't even have the decency to make up a lie. You felt it acceptable to drag them into your family dynamics. Really? Why should they be punished for your shitty relationship with your parents? I get that it was thoughtless, but, unless you think it was done with deliberate malice you could have sucked it up. It was their big day. It wasn't about you.", "YTA.  The grooms sister did a check in to see if you were coming.   You responded with, \"I didn't receive an invite?\".  She told you it was sent to your parents.  At this point, you lost it, got blamey and self righteous and declared you were not going, even though she had clearly stated that you were indeed invited.  Not productive.   Who knows who actually addressed the invites and where they got their info?  The grooms sister is on the line, it is an opportunity to cut through trouble,  not create more.  You could have asked her what does she suggest you do?  Or perhaps suggest she speak to her brother and confirm he actually wants OP there.  But instead you chose to be rude.  A wedding is a huge undertaking.   A lot of logistics.   They fucked up one address on an invite.   You could have been gracious.   Offer an apology.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You all are grown ass adults with your own homes and lives. A big part of planning a wedding is getting everyone's correct address.

It\u2019s not about being hand delivered by Zeus\u2019 chariot (?) but if cousin actually wanted them to go they could\u2019ve taken the 5 minutes to get an address", "Yeah that shows they don't have a leg to stand on as you were clear you hadn't even seen the invite. She didn't even have the decency to reply to you.\n\nWas the extended family aware of your estrangement with your parents? Are they also punishing you for this too? \n\nSend a message to Kyle and connect with him again. You simply had no details to go on and you live a long way away.", "So to recap, they don't know your address or phone but you expected a formal mailed invitation?", "This is good insight and likely very true!", "Do you think this was done maliciously by your cousin?", "This is where the petty comes in, you\u2019re being way too picky about how you\u2019re invited. You really need a verbal or physical invitation from the groom? Do you think your cousin was trying to slight you with the invitation being sent to your parents? I have a hard time thinking the cousin hates you so much that the mistake was made on purpose. What do you think happened?", "And this is why you\u2019re an asshole. You wanted to be stubborn and play the technicality game, and now you\u2019re upset at the reaction.", "Nah doubt he needs a wedding gift. You\u2019re right, it would be a nice gesture but\u2026unless OP has a lot of disposable income I doubt anyone\u2019s expecting it and that would be super generous", "It's not a formal mailed invitation, it appears they didn't tell them anything. Just asked if they were coming and then left them on read. The sister could have followed up with \"oh what a mix up, here are all the details, sorry about that\". But instead they were left on read.", "Calling OP's text response a tantrum seems pretty melodramatic", "This is a bad take. Adults get their own invitations. How does OP rsvp without the rsvp card? Does OP get a plus one? How is that name shared? How does OP submit their entree choices? Is the groom going to text a link to the registry or is OP off the hook for buying a gift?\n\nSomeone did this to me once and sent a \"family\" invite to my parents when I lived in a completely different city. Was I actually invited? Was my fiance? We would have been married by the time the wedding actually happened. \n\nUltimately I decided not to go, because it wasn't clear to me that I was invited, much less my husband, and I wasn't interested in attending a wedding, newly married, without my husband there. It's unfortunate because I had been friends with this person for years, and we aren't now, but if I'm not worth the effort of an invitation, we were obviously not that close.\n\nI planned a wedding with over 200 people, and adults who lived on their own got their own invitations with their own plus ones. I did my invitations while working full time, training for my first marathon, AND getting my masters degree. It's completely doable and honestly EASIER than tracking down missing rsvps and playing telephone with everyone's meal choices and guests.", "I wouldn\u2019t accept a 2nd hand invitation to a wedding either. It was completely on the groom to reach out and make the invitation. My husband has like 30 first cousins and we tracked down all their addresses for the wedding and invited them because we didn\u2019t want anyone to feel left out. Most of the ones who rsvp\u2019d no showed anyway. But we made the effort because it was our wedding and our responsibility to get the invites to the right location.", "I would also ask cousin why they didn't reach out to you directly for your address?  Seems to be a no-brainer, especially since he knows you're estranged from your parents.", "Good for you. I've done the same. It's not a one size fits all take. Just because you understand something a certain way, and are obviously more organized than the OPs cousin, doesn't mean they are shitty for not doing it your way, nor is mine a \"bad take\". I've seen both ways, and both can work depending on the level of communication between families.", "I wouldn\u2019t. Just explaining the situation would get the point across. No reason to hash it all out.", "I didn't share to brag, I shared because you indicated that planning a wedding is somehow an excuse for ineffective invitations. It isn't. If you don't want to put in the effort to actually invite people, simply don't invite them. No one is making you do it. You can invite as many or as few people as you want. You can make your wedding as complex or as simple as you want. But what you can't do, is send knowingly ineffective invitations (OPs cousin knew she was no contact with her parents) and then complain when the invitation recipient is confused.\n\nAnd the honest truth is that OPs cousin didn't care that the invitation was ineffective. If he did, he would have passed on all of the required information (date, time, location, dress code, meal choices, hotel block, registry, plus one or no plus one) as soon as he found out he had used the wrong address. Without that information, OP couldn't attend even if she wanted to. And withholding the information, or intentionally making OP jump through hoops to find it when she's already made it clear she never received the invite, is a strong indicator that OP wasn't actually wanted there.\n\nIf my sister told me \"hey, cousin X never received your invitation,\" I would have gone out of my way to apologize and tell cousin X everything she needed to possibly attend. I also would have completely understood if, given the lateness of the invite, cousin X couldn't make it. But I NEVER would have thought \"sucks to suck, cousin X, you can ask me about the information if you want to come.\"\n\nWhether \"family\" invites *can* work is not the issue. (Though I maintain that they often don't because they don't clarify whether SOs and children of the adults in the \"family\" are invited). Even if they could work, here it clearly hasn't. The issue is whether someone can justifiably skip a wedding when the information required to attend said wedding is not provided.", "Most of the post I agree with. What I disagree with is that you think I said it's an excuse. I said it's a reason. There's a big difference. The bride and groom obviously didn't mean it with malice, which is why it wasn't being used as an excuse. The rest of your post I totally get. I'm just saying that I've seen it done the other way, and it works too.\n\nEdited to add: marathon training sucks. I've done 4 fulls, and shall never do it again lol."]}
