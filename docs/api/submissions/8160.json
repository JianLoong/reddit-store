Now I\u2019m getting heat from my family and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the AH?\n\nI say this because my other cousin, Kyles sister, messaged me a month before the wedding and she\u2019s like \u201chey! You going to the wedding in November?\u201d And I was like \u201coh, I don\u2019t think so.. I haven\u2019t been invited to any weddings?\u201d. \nShe explained that my invite had been sent to my parents house but here\u2019s the kicker - they all know I\u2019m estranged from my mom and dad. We haven\u2019t talked in 2 years so obviously no one told me about my invite even if I was invited.\nPlus, I haven\u2019t lived at home in 8 years - and I\u2019ve moved to 2 different major cities in that time. \n\nSo this is where I might\u2019ve been the AH. I said that I was never actually invited to the wedding. No one asked me where my address was and I\u2019m not just going to ask Kyle where my invite went and risk inviting myself to the wedding. If he really wanted me there, he would\u2019ve made an effort to contact me himself, therefore I was never actually invited and I won\u2019t be attending. She left me on read and I never heard from them on Christmas. \n\nSome of my friends understand but others think I\u2019m being stubborn and the groom may have been to busy to worry about my invite. My entire family is ignoring me \n\nWhat do you all think?

I would apologize to your cousin for not goings and say you didn't know he wanted you there.", "NTA- they know you don't speak to your parents, and a month before hand they found out you never received an invite.  If Kyle had wanted you there, he should have personally called you, apologized for not having your address correct, and asked you if you could attend.  It is a phone call that would take a few minutes.  \n\nYour family sucks for ignoring you over this, this is a situation they created.", "INFO What did Kyle's sister say when you told her that? Does Kyle have your number?", "NTA, the sister obviously has your number. Why didn't they just ask for your adress? I would assume I wasn't invited either. You find out the adress, it's ridiculous to send your invite to your parents house.", "NTA.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, your presence was not important to the wedding - at least not to your cousin. If he really wanted you there, he'd have put the minimal effort into actually inviting you. As it was, it sounds like he sent a \"familial obligation\" invitation out without caring if it got to you.\n\nIf it wasn't important enough to him, why should it be that important to you?\n\nSounds like you're not close. I'd say N-A-H normally, but anyone giving you grief over not showing up is certainly being an asshole.", "Nta if she really wanted to go she would of sent a text(that way always had address) hey OP I'm getting married and doing invites can I have your address\" 2 seconds", "I think you don't care what they think. And that's your decision to make. NTA.", "Whether intentionally or by accident they tried to manipulate you into talking to your parents. \n\nNTA for holding up your boundaries , but a month before the wedding when other cousin texted, you could\u2019ve given your new address and asked for an invite.", "NTA \n\nThey know you are an adult living separately. The invitation should go to you or you are not invited. Plus they know you were estranged from your parents. So truthfully they did not send you an invitation since it was sent to your parents and not you. \n\nWas this their way of trying to force y\u2019all to communicate?", "NAH, but I think you were being a bit stubborn about it. Keeping track of addresses is hard and it could have been an accident. They reached out to confirm when they didn't hear from you.  Could have been handled differently.", "NTA\n\nI agree that you weren't technically invited to the wedding. Family members obviously know how to contact you, so they could have easily gotten your address to ensure that you received an invitation.\n\nSending it to the house if your estranged parent is a sure way to ensure that you don't know about the invitation and don't attend.", "Part of the wedding process is obtaining physical mailing addresses. Clearly you have contact with family, and I\u2019m guessing they have your phone number. All it would have taken is a text to get your address for the invite. \n\nNTA. They\u2019re purposefully being obtuse and obstinate.", "YTA. It was made clear to you by your other cousin that you were invited, so claiming you weren't is just a lie, period. You admit that you have lived in multiple cities in the last 8 years and Kyle might have a lot on his plate, hence not having the correct address to send your invitation to.\n\n~~Info: Is the address on your invitation the sole reason you didn't go? As in, would you have gone if the invite arrived in your own mailbox?~~", "YTA, gently. Honestly, I see where you're coming from, but I wonder if the reason was not as malicious as you think. Tracking down every relative is a pain in the ass. A lot of couples find it easier to send one blanket invitation to the \"family\" and expect it gets disseminated from there. Your relationship with your parents aside, you did say you moved around a lot.  I agree with the sister. You were invited, and you're being stubborn. She literally just told you that you are invited. Take that at face value.", "Proof positive that cousins can be Flying Monkeys too. NTA", "NTA. This feels like a lazy gift grab. Include you on the invite list, and then don\u2019t mention not getting an RSVP until a month before, all while attempting to force you and your parents to reconnect. Or, they were legit busy and didn\u2019t consider your situation, completely plausible when planning a wedding. If you wish, extend an olive branch by sending a gift. Their reaction will tell you everything you need to know. Not sure what happened between you and your parents, but not letting you know is something most families would disagree with, your parents may have told a different story to the newleyweds.", "YTA - if you wanted to go, just go. If you want to cause a problem, then you did fine.", "INFO how far is the wedding from where you're located?\n\nYTA if you live nearby. You sound like you're fairly transient so tracking down your address may be a pain and it would be easier for the cousin to include you with the family's invitation - estranged or not. They also messaged you a month out, clearly indicating you're invited, so your reasoning for not attending because you 'didn't receive an invitation' is petty.\n\nNTA if you live across the country and making arrangements like that a month out is costly and impractical. \n\nAt the end of the day, if the sole reason you didn't attend is because you didn't get a formal invitation in the mail, then you need to get over yourself.", "YTA. If you don't want to go cause your estranged parents are there, that's understandable. But sulking cause the groom took the easy way out makes you just... sad. His sister likely called you to make up for the error but now you're choosing to be petty.", "ESH\n\nLife doesn't revolve around you, just go to the wedding sheesh.  Maybe they were super busy and didn't have time to find your address?  On the other hand, they too could have put in some more effort to find your address and make sure you were invited.\n\nUnless you really want to be estranged from that part of the family too, I would say go to the wedding, UNLESS you hate weddings, then skip it.", "YTA\n\nWedding planning is busy. They fucked up, but assuming it was a mistake with no malicious intent, your response is rude.\n\nMake sure you're not mistaking intentional ignoring for just genuinely not wanting to talk to you.", "YTA I was opposite until I reread . Yes you don\u2019t have to attend and yes they made a mistake sending to your mother \n\nBut you could easily asked her details when she said you were invited  but you were being petty and punishing them for sending the invite to your mother and frankly If your post is what you wrote on the message it does come across as rude aswell . I would have left you on read too.\n\nWhat you should have done was remind her that you are NC with your mother and now that you were told  with 1 month notice , it was too little notice and could not attend.", "YTA. I don't know most of my cousins addresses. If I was sending out invites and needed my cousin's address, I would ask my mom who would ask my aunt etc. and whatever address made its way back to me would be added to a list with a lot of other addresses. I wouldn't stop and read each address and be like \"oh wait, I think she's not talking to her parents and this looks like her parents' address, let's double check this one\" because I'd be too busy planning a fucking wedding. \n\nYou could've just said \"can you check with Kyle and make sure I'm invited?\" when his sister texted you, instead of going off on her with your \"if they really wanted me there they would've made an effort\" whining. \n\nIf I'm planning a wedding and that's the response I got, I would think \"fuck it, I don't have time to soothe her ego right now\" and move on. Because the wedding isn't about YOU, it's about the people getting married.", "YTA your cousin knows you're estranged from your parents but doesn't know your address, who's fault is that? They've never been to your home?", "NTA.  Your family needs to send you invitations at your home.", "YTA. You knew you were invited. You didn't even have the decency to make up a lie. You felt it acceptable to drag them into your family dynamics. Really? Why should they be punished for your shitty relationship with your parents? I get that it was thoughtless, but, unless you think it was done with deliberate malice you could have sucked it up. It was their big day. It wasn't about you.", "YTA.  The grooms sister did a check in to see if you were coming.   You responded with, \"I didn't receive an invite?\".  She told you it was sent to your parents.  At this point, you lost it, got blamey and self righteous and declared you were not going, even though she had clearly stated that you were indeed invited.  Not productive.   Who knows who actually addressed the invites and where they got their info?  The grooms sister is on the line, it is an opportunity to cut through trouble,  not create more.  You could have asked her what does she suggest you do?  Or perhaps suggest she speak to her brother and confirm he actually wants OP there.  But instead you chose to be rude.  A wedding is a huge undertaking.   A lot of logistics.   They fucked up one address on an invite.   You could have been gracious.   Offer an apology.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You knew that you were invited,  but chose not to attend over a technicality.  Now you want to be told that you were fully in the right for not attending. \n\nIt doesn't matter that you didn't attend, whether you wanted to go or not.   The problem is that you want everyone to justify your actions and proclaim the rest of your family AHs.  Accept responsibility for your decision.   \n\nYou made the conscious decision not to go.  Your family is choosing to avoid you because they believe that you are not interested in participating in family events.  Both sides are justified in their actions.   Trying to make the others into AHs is the definition of AH", "ESH. You know you've been invited. Kyle 100% should've checked, but you are now aware, and Kyle's sister knows you know, so he will find out if you don't show up and pretend you never knew.\n\nEither way, refusing to show up makes you out as being uppity and petty.", "Nta", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not close enough to be invited except as part of your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCall them and go if you want, or don't go.

If anyone should apologize it\u2019s the groom that didn\u2019t make an effort to get her address.   I don\u2019t think she missed much by not going and the groom didn\u2019t miss much by her not being there.  It doesn\u2019t sound as if they were close anyway.", "She just left me on read. Kyle and I don\u2019t have each others numbers but we\u2019re friends on Facebook", "Especially since they def invited my estranged parents. My assumption would be they invited them and not me to keep the peace.", "Yes. Because it translates to me that we aren\u2019t that close in the first place, he should\u2019ve reached out. I also know my aunt (his mom) and my mom talk regularly so I have a hard time believing he didn\u2019t know where I lived.", "But you can't take that at face value. It's a casual verbal invite with no details from the sister of the groom, where she may have just assumed OP was invited. What if OP had said yeah I'm coming, then shown up to find their acceptance  hadn't made it to the list and there was no place for them at the reception. \n\nIn this day and age there are no excuses for not being able to contact cousins individually. The sister contacted OP easily, then made no effort to follow up with a proper invite, even a screenshot would have sufficed! It's pretty clear however that this family isn't close, since they didn't know their aunt and uncle hasn't even passed the invitation on. \n\nOP is NTA", "This. Unless there are other indications that they (or other family members) are trying to manipulate you back into a relationship with your parents, this was likely an oversight during a stressful time, not malicious. They had a thousand things to keep track of, & while your estrangement from your parents is (rightfully!) a Big Deal to you, it's reasonable to think that it slipped their minds or they hoped your parents would forward it on. It sounds like to you it felt like a personal slight, but there are so many more charitable interpretations.", "Thank you for your judgment, it was part me being stubborn but also part me not wanting to invite myself if I actually wasn\u2019t invited.

You are NTA.", "I wouldn't worry about it. Depending on how much your cousins actually know about the situation with you and your parents this could all be poor communication.\n\nYour other cousin didn't follow up with you after asking which doesn't really make sense. But who knows knows what they've been told by others. You told the truth. No one told you about the wedding so you have no details about it. If your cousins don't provide you with the in how are you supposed to know if you can go or not?\n\nMaybe your cousin is upset because he feels he did invite you.", "\"Because it translates to me that we aren\u2019t that close in the first place\" ... You OBVIOUSLY are not. But that is no reason for a tantrum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou CHOSE not to go qand unstead throw a tantrum over a formrality .. you KNEW you were invited. \n\nHe CHOSE not to mae the effort to invote ypu personally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n So not THAT important from EITHER side.", "I've edited my post to reflect that you are, indeed, the asshole.", "I have to disagree in this situation. Have you been married and had to track down 150+ people? It's exhausting. It's common practice to send one invite to the family and have them RSVP for the group. Now op wasn't super clear on that aspect, so it's hard to fully judge, but if the groom's sister asked, that means they've talked about it, and you are welcome.", "Well, the easy way around it would have been to tell his sister 'Hey, can you confirm that he wants me there?', but there isn't much you can do now. I would reach out and apologize, because I do think you were a bit petty.", "I hope everything smooths over. Hopefully you end up going and having a good time!", "Exactly! I'm from a large family and before anyone sends out something like wedding invitations, they check to see that they have current addresses on all of the cousins because several people may have moved in the years since the last wedding.", "Still no details. Where is it? What time? Dress code? For all she knows OP may have specifically not been invited and she's grossly overstepping. The groom's sister isn't the groom. \n\nIt might be common practice where you are from but does that apply to estranged families? If the cousin hadn't spoken to OP they would have had no idea of the wedding taking place at all.", "Thanks, unfortunately the wedding was back in Nov 2022 so this is why they\u2019re upset with me. But I do appreciate your kind words!"]}
