Now I\u2019m getting heat from my family and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the AH?\n\nI say this because my other cousin, Kyles sister, messaged me a month before the wedding and she\u2019s like \u201chey! You going to the wedding in November?\u201d And I was like \u201coh, I don\u2019t think so.. I haven\u2019t been invited to any weddings?\u201d. \nShe explained that my invite had been sent to my parents house but here\u2019s the kicker - they all know I\u2019m estranged from my mom and dad. We haven\u2019t talked in 2 years so obviously no one told me about my invite even if I was invited.\nPlus, I haven\u2019t lived at home in 8 years - and I\u2019ve moved to 2 different major cities in that time. \n\nSo this is where I might\u2019ve been the AH. I said that I was never actually invited to the wedding. No one asked me where my address was and I\u2019m not just going to ask Kyle where my invite went and risk inviting myself to the wedding. If he really wanted me there, he would\u2019ve made an effort to contact me himself, therefore I was never actually invited and I won\u2019t be attending. She left me on read and I never heard from them on Christmas. \n\nSome of my friends understand but others think I\u2019m being stubborn and the groom may have been to busy to worry about my invite. My entire family is ignoring me \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA?\n\nUpdate: thanks for letting me know what you think,  I will reach out to Kyle and wish him well on his marriage. I will say, I wasn\u2019t expecting people to be so mean about mine and my parents estrangement but I will say that I will never regret stopping the abuse as soon as I could. I hope if you\u2019re in the same situation, you\u2019ll find strength to do the same.

I would apologize to your cousin for not goings and say you didn't know he wanted you there.", "NTA- they know you don't speak to your parents, and a month before hand they found out you never received an invite.  If Kyle had wanted you there, he should have personally called you, apologized for not having your address correct, and asked you if you could attend.  It is a phone call that would take a few minutes.  \n\nYour family sucks for ignoring you over this, this is a situation they created.", "INFO What did Kyle's sister say when you told her that? Does Kyle have your number?", "NTA, the sister obviously has your number. Why didn't they just ask for your adress? I would assume I wasn't invited either. You find out the adress, it's ridiculous to send your invite to your parents house.", "NTA.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, your presence was not important to the wedding - at least not to your cousin. If he really wanted you there, he'd have put the minimal effort into actually inviting you. As it was, it sounds like he sent a \"familial obligation\" invitation out without caring if it got to you.\n\nIf it wasn't important enough to him, why should it be that important to you?\n\nSounds like you're not close. I'd say N-A-H normally, but anyone giving you grief over not showing up is certainly being an asshole.", "Nta if she really wanted to go she would of sent a text(that way always had address) hey OP I'm getting married and doing invites can I have your address\" 2 seconds", "I think you don't care what they think. And that's your decision to make. NTA.", "Whether intentionally or by accident they tried to manipulate you into talking to your parents. \n\nNTA for holding up your boundaries , but a month before the wedding when other cousin texted, you could\u2019ve given your new address and asked for an invite.", "NTA \n\nThey know you are an adult living separately. The invitation should go to you or you are not invited. Plus they know you were estranged from your parents. So truthfully they did not send you an invitation since it was sent to your parents and not you. \n\nWas this their way of trying to force y\u2019all to communicate?", "NAH, but I think you were being a bit stubborn about it. Keeping track of addresses is hard and it could have been an accident. They reached out to confirm when they didn't hear from you.  Could have been handled differently.", "NTA\n\nI agree that you weren't technically invited to the wedding. Family members obviously know how to contact you, so they could have easily gotten your address to ensure that you received an invitation.\n\nSending it to the house if your estranged parent is a sure way to ensure that you don't know about the invitation and don't attend.", "Part of the wedding process is obtaining physical mailing addresses. Clearly you have contact with family, and I\u2019m guessing they have your phone number. All it would have taken is a text to get your address for the invite. \n\nNTA. They\u2019re purposefully being obtuse and obstinate.", "YTA. It was made clear to you by your other cousin that you were invited, so claiming you weren't is just a lie, period. You admit that you have lived in multiple cities in the last 8 years and Kyle might have a lot on his plate, hence not having the correct address to send your invitation to.\n\n~~Info: Is the address on your invitation the sole reason you didn't go? As in, would you have gone if the invite arrived in your own mailbox?~~", "YTA, gently. Honestly, I see where you're coming from, but I wonder if the reason was not as malicious as you think. Tracking down every relative is a pain in the ass. A lot of couples find it easier to send one blanket invitation to the \"family\" and expect it gets disseminated from there. Your relationship with your parents aside, you did say you moved around a lot.  I agree with the sister. You were invited, and you're being stubborn. She literally just told you that you are invited. Take that at face value.", "Proof positive that cousins can be Flying Monkeys too. NTA", "NTA. This feels like a lazy gift grab. Include you on the invite list, and then don\u2019t mention not getting an RSVP until a month before, all while attempting to force you and your parents to reconnect. Or, they were legit busy and didn\u2019t consider your situation, completely plausible when planning a wedding. If you wish, extend an olive branch by sending a gift. Their reaction will tell you everything you need to know. Not sure what happened between you and your parents, but not letting you know is something most families would disagree with, your parents may have told a different story to the newleyweds.", "YTA - if you wanted to go, just go. If you want to cause a problem, then you did fine.", "INFO how far is the wedding from where you're located?\n\nYTA if you live nearby. You sound like you're fairly transient so tracking down your address may be a pain and it would be easier for the cousin to include you with the family's invitation - estranged or not. They also messaged you a month out, clearly indicating you're invited, so your reasoning for not attending because you 'didn't receive an invitation' is petty.\n\nNTA if you live across the country and making arrangements like that a month out is costly and impractical. \n\nAt the end of the day, if the sole reason you didn't attend is because you didn't get a formal invitation in the mail, then you need to get over yourself.", "YTA. If you don't want to go cause your estranged parents are there, that's understandable. But sulking cause the groom took the easy way out makes you just... sad. His sister likely called you to make up for the error but now you're choosing to be petty.", "ESH\n\nLife doesn't revolve around you, just go to the wedding sheesh.  Maybe they were super busy and didn't have time to find your address?  On the other hand, they too could have put in some more effort to find your address and make sure you were invited.\n\nUnless you really want to be estranged from that part of the family too, I would say go to the wedding, UNLESS you hate weddings, then skip it.", "YTA\n\nWedding planning is busy. They fucked up, but assuming it was a mistake with no malicious intent, your response is rude.\n\nMake sure you're not mistaking intentional ignoring for just genuinely not wanting to talk to you.", "YTA I was opposite until I reread . Yes you don\u2019t have to attend and yes they made a mistake sending to your mother \n\nBut you could easily asked her details when she said you were invited  but you were being petty and punishing them for sending the invite to your mother and frankly If your post is what you wrote on the message it does come across as rude aswell . I would have left you on read too.\n\nWhat you should have done was remind her that you are NC with your mother and now that you were told  with 1 month notice , it was too little notice and could not attend.", "YTA. I don't know most of my cousins addresses. If I was sending out invites and needed my cousin's address, I would ask my mom who would ask my aunt etc. and whatever address made its way back to me would be added to a list with a lot of other addresses. I wouldn't stop and read each address and be like \"oh wait, I think she's not talking to her parents and this looks like her parents' address, let's double check this one\" because I'd be too busy planning a fucking wedding. \n\nYou could've just said \"can you check with Kyle and make sure I'm invited?\" when his sister texted you, instead of going off on her with your \"if they really wanted me there they would've made an effort\" whining. \n\nIf I'm planning a wedding and that's the response I got, I would think \"fuck it, I don't have time to soothe her ego right now\" and move on. Because the wedding isn't about YOU, it's about the people getting married.", "YTA your cousin knows you're estranged from your parents but doesn't know your address, who's fault is that? They've never been to your home?", "NTA.  Your family needs to send you invitations at your home.", "YTA. You knew you were invited. You didn't even have the decency to make up a lie. You felt it acceptable to drag them into your family dynamics. Really? Why should they be punished for your shitty relationship with your parents? I get that it was thoughtless, but, unless you think it was done with deliberate malice you could have sucked it up. It was their big day. It wasn't about you.", "YTA.  The grooms sister did a check in to see if you were coming.   You responded with, \"I didn't receive an invite?\".  She told you it was sent to your parents.  At this point, you lost it, got blamey and self righteous and declared you were not going, even though she had clearly stated that you were indeed invited.  Not productive.   Who knows who actually addressed the invites and where they got their info?  The grooms sister is on the line, it is an opportunity to cut through trouble,  not create more.  You could have asked her what does she suggest you do?  Or perhaps suggest she speak to her brother and confirm he actually wants OP there.  But instead you chose to be rude.  A wedding is a huge undertaking.   A lot of logistics.   They fucked up one address on an invite.   You could have been gracious.   Offer an apology.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We get along well, but live far and life happens. She is a relative on my dads side, and knows I don\u2019t speak to my dad, and still took the time to find my address to invite me. It\u2019s not about being hand delivered by Zeus\u2019 chariot (?) but if cousin actually wanted them to go they could\u2019ve taken the 5 minutes to get an address", "Yeah that shows they don't have a leg to stand on as you were clear you hadn't even seen the invite. She didn't even have the decency to reply to you.\n\nWas the extended family aware of your estrangement with your parents? Are they also punishing you for this too? \n\nSend a message to Kyle and connect with him again. You simply had no details to go on and you live a long way away.", "So to recap, they don't know your address or phone but you expected a formal mailed invitation?", "This is good insight and likely very true!", "Do you think this was done maliciously by your cousin?", "This is where the petty comes in, you\u2019re being way too picky about how you\u2019re invited. You really need a verbal or physical invitation from the groom? Do you think your cousin was trying to slight you with the invitation being sent to your parents? I have a hard time thinking the cousin hates you so much that the mistake was made on purpose. What do you think happened?", "And this is why you\u2019re an asshole. You wanted to be stubborn and play the technicality game, and now you\u2019re upset at the reaction.", "Nah doubt he needs a wedding gift. You\u2019re right, it would be a nice gesture but\u2026unless OP has a lot of disposable income I doubt anyone\u2019s expecting it and that would be super generous", "It's not a formal mailed invitation, it appears they didn't tell them anything. Just asked if they were coming and then left them on read. The sister could have followed up with \"oh what a mix up, here are all the details, sorry about that\". But instead they were left on read.", "Calling OP's text response a tantrum seems pretty melodramatic", "This is a bad take. Adults get their own invitations. How does OP rsvp without the rsvp card? Does OP get a plus one? How is that name shared? How does OP submit their entree choices? Is the groom going to text a link to the registry or is OP off the hook for buying a gift?\n\nSomeone did this to me once and sent a \"family\" invite to my parents when I lived in a completely different city. Was I actually invited? Was my fiance? We would have been married by the time the wedding actually happened. \n\nUltimately I decided not to go, because it wasn't clear to me that I was invited, much less my husband, and I wasn't interested in attending a wedding, newly married, without my husband there. It's unfortunate because I had been friends with this person for years, and we aren't now, but if I'm not worth the effort of an invitation, we were obviously not that close.\n\nI planned a wedding with over 200 people, and adults who lived on their own got their own invitations with their own plus ones. I did my invitations while working full time, training for my first marathon, AND getting my masters degree. It's completely doable and honestly EASIER than tracking down missing rsvps and playing telephone with everyone's meal choices and guests.", "I wouldn\u2019t accept a 2nd hand invitation to a wedding either. It was completely on the groom to reach out and make the invitation. My husband has like 30 first cousins and we tracked down all their addresses for the wedding and invited them because we didn\u2019t want anyone to feel left out. Most of the ones who rsvp\u2019d no showed anyway. But we made the effort because it was our wedding and our responsibility to get the invites to the right location.", "I would also ask cousin why they didn't reach out to you directly for your address?  Seems to be a no-brainer, especially since he knows you're estranged from your parents.", "Good for you. I've done the same. It's not a one size fits all take. Just because you understand something a certain way, and are obviously more organized than the OPs cousin, doesn't mean they are shitty for not doing it your way, nor is mine a \"bad take\". I've seen both ways, and both can work depending on the level of communication between families.", "I wouldn\u2019t. Just explaining the situation would get the point across. No reason to hash it all out.", "I didn't share to brag, I shared because you indicated that planning a wedding is somehow an excuse for ineffective invitations. It isn't. If you don't want to put in the effort to actually invite people, simply don't invite them. No one is making you do it. You can invite as many or as few people as you want. You can make your wedding as complex or as simple as you want. But what you can't do, is send knowingly ineffective invitations (OPs cousin knew she was no contact with her parents) and then complain when the invitation recipient is confused.\n\nAnd the honest truth is that OPs cousin didn't care that the invitation was ineffective. If he did, he would have passed on all of the required information (date, time, location, dress code, meal choices, hotel block, registry, plus one or no plus one) as soon as he found out he had used the wrong address. Without that information, OP couldn't attend even if she wanted to. And withholding the information, or intentionally making OP jump through hoops to find it when she's already made it clear she never received the invite, is a strong indicator that OP wasn't actually wanted there.\n\nIf my sister told me \"hey, cousin X never received your invitation,\" I would have gone out of my way to apologize and tell cousin X everything she needed to possibly attend. I also would have completely understood if, given the lateness of the invite, cousin X couldn't make it. But I NEVER would have thought \"sucks to suck, cousin X, you can ask me about the information if you want to come.\"\n\nWhether \"family\" invites *can* work is not the issue. (Though I maintain that they often don't because they don't clarify whether SOs and children of the adults in the \"family\" are invited). Even if they could work, here it clearly hasn't. The issue is whether someone can justifiably skip a wedding when the information required to attend said wedding is not provided.", "Most of the post I agree with. What I disagree with is that you think I said it's an excuse. I said it's a reason. There's a big difference. The bride and groom obviously didn't mean it with malice, which is why it wasn't being used as an excuse. The rest of your post I totally get. I'm just saying that I've seen it done the other way, and it works too.\n\nEdited to add: marathon training sucks. I've done 4 fulls, and shall never do it again lol.", "NTA\n\nAnd I strongly disagree with the AH judgments that say you knew your were invited.  No, you did not.  Your cousin - the *groom* \\- did not message you that you were invited.  His *sister* said you were.  She could have been mistaken.  She could have seen an early guest list, that later removed you.  She could have just been assuming incorrectly that her brother invited you and must have sent your invite to your mom's.  Hell, she could have been straight up lying to cause drama.\n\nWhen you messaged her back that you had not received an invite and could not just message Kyle to ask if you were invited to his wedding (you are right - that would have been incredibly rude), she could have easily responded with \"Let me get your address to send you an invite.\"  Or \"I'll let Kyle know to message you.\"  She did nothing.  He did nothing.  They were very aware that you were unsure of your invite status (ONE MONTH BEFORE THE WEDDING) and did nothing to clear things up.\n\nThat's not on you.", "Tough I'm going to go with NAH. You didn't receive an invite and so you didn't go. Fair enough. I get why you didn't want to ask. \n\nNow you're relationship with your parents probably wasn't at the top of Kyle's remembering things list of priorities.

Sounds to me like Kyle doesn't esp want OP there, and if I was OP i'd feel the same, send a card and not go because it also doesn't sound like either OP nor Kyle are thinking about this as hard as we are. OP is not the a-h in any way shape or form. Even if he did get an invite, it's not a freaking summons, and get your fainting couch ready - he could STILL CHOOSE NOT TO GO.", "except it WASN'T clear as crystal. OP was not sent an invitation, what aren't you understanding here? \"are you going\" is a) NOT AN INVITATION and b) was not asked by the people throwing the wedding. if a friend was throwing a party you weren't aware of and friend's neighbor's kid's schoolmate's teacher asked you if you were going, would you assume you were invited? wtf", "Yes, I would\u2019ve went had I been sure of my invite. My family dynamics are not great, I didn\u2019t want to be set up for a self-invite. What if I showed up and there was no space for me? Or what if I went around asking everyone if I\u2019m invited? Either way it\u2019s a lose/lose for me. I thought I did the polite thing, but I will reach out and wish them well on their marriage.", "Can you please say all that a little louder.", "Would you have gone if they had sent you an invite a month before the wedding?", "LOL! He could absolutely CHOOSE NOT TO GO, but then why is he in here wondering if he's an AH?? LOL because he knows that an invitation to the wrong address is no excuse to put your petty pants on. He says he and Kyle don't have each other's numbers but Kyle's sister does and she DID reach out to ask about him coming. Instead of graciously accepting the invitation went to the wrong address, he sent a lecture about how Kyle should have taken time to ensure that his address was correct and he was the victim of some heinous crime... He's an AH :)", "[deleted]", "I just can\u2019t imagine not going to a loved ones wedding because they made a mistake with my invitation. OP doesn\u2019t indicate that the cousin did this on purpose so I don\u2019t understand why they felt so insulted. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I wouldn't know if one of my cousins was estranged from their parents.", "you and i either speak different languages or have different comprehension rates. OP is NTA for declining to go to a wedding they didn't receive an invite for - even if somebody told them after the fact it was a mistake. OP seems lot less offended than I would be if somebody sent something meant for me to people they know i will never talk to again.", "not obvious at all, but even if she was - so what? still doesn't mean OP knew he was invited. For all he knows, sis needed a seat filler and was making it all up. THAT actually makes more sense then sending a wedding invite to the estranged parents of an adult.", "I would guess (since we don\u2019t have further information) that OP was invited only because they were related and the groom himself didn\u2019t care either way if she attended. Op says in her comments that she and the groom as Facebook friends but don\u2019t have each other\u2019s numbers so I\u2019d wager they aren\u2019t close. Really her family making a big deal out of it is ridiculous given that they expected her to make flight, hotel, and car rental plans less than a month before the wedding. They were asking a lot of a person whom they didn\u2019t take the basic step to confirm the address of.", "So let me get this straight. Kyle doesn't know him well enough to have his number but definitely knows him well enough to know he's never speaking to his parents again.... ok guy.... Some people will believe anything the internet tells them. This guy knows he's the AH and that's why he's here. No one is family has called him that, he's here on his own recognizance. To me, that's pretty telling. But once again, you justify however you want. The glory of this sub is varying opinions from different perspectives.", "NTA. People keep bringing up that the sister told her a month in advance. Okay\u2026 but knowing there\u2019s a wedding doesn\u2019t help. They would need an invitation to rsvp to, to know when/where, dress code. Once they knew she didn\u2019t have an invite it was on them to correct the situation.", "NTA. They intentionally sent your invite to an address they knew you weren't living at. It doesn't actually matter why you weren't living there - it is not your fault your previous residence failed to forward your mail properly.\n\nAlso they're TA for being too lazy to source your actual address, or for some sort of underhanded effort to force you into contact with your abusers. To hell with them and their wedding anyway.", "NTA. You're 26 years old. Even if you weren't estranged from your parents, you would be 100% justified in not going if you didn't receive your own invitation. Extended family need to realize that children do become adults who are separate from their parents.", "NTA if they know you don\u2019t speak to your parents then how could you have been invited? Are they trying to pull a stunt to encourage the relationship to return? Did they do it to claim they invited you knowing you\u2019d never get it? Good on you for stopping the abuse and setting that boundary. It\u2019s so hard to do but can improve your life exponentially.", "NTA. You are all adults, not children. You require an invite to go to a wedding. They know you aren't talking to your parents and still sent it to your parents' place. If they really wanted you there, they would have sent it to you directly.", "NTA!\n\nIf they knew you were estranged from your parents, they should have asked you about your new address.\n\nIgnore the mean people!", "NTA.  It's your job to make sure family (for whom you wish to have a relationship with) knows how to contact you or else they may be left with no other option than to send stuff to your parents.  If they wanted you at the wedding bad enough they would have reached out directly to get your address to send the invite so it may have just been an oversight but one where they should have apologized for not verifying your mailing address for the invite.  The whole thing realistically could be seen as an unfortunate oversight where everyone can regret that you missed out and then move on.  The really shitty thing here is that your parent's should have either reached out to you to simply say you have mail at the house or to reach out to your cousin to let them know you are estranged from them so the invite will need to be forwarded on elsewhere.  My daughter isn't talking to me right now and if she got mail at my house I would make sure she found out about it.  That's just common courtesy.", "NTA  Your cousin had to know that you are not living at parent's home after 8 years.  If he wanted you there, when he didn't receive the RSVP, he should have let you know about the wedding.  Since he didn't, he fault.", "NTA", "I am leaning toward NAH\u2026not clear what actually happened or whose oversight/screw-up it was\u2026but I do wonder what calling cousin said to this or how they thought you should all proceed? Like, could she resend? Send a link to a wedding site? Say \u201coh well I can add you right now if you want\u201d? Just kind of confused on how the conversation went after saying no, haven\u2019t seen it.", "YTA\n\nBecause you actually knew you were invited.  It sucks that they sent it to the wrong place but they are probably under a lot of stress and not able to remember every issue going on with the family.", "YTA \nYou \"got\" an invite. It was sent for you. You know you are invited. Someone called you to confirm. They know you know about the wedding....\n\nWhat more more you want? Do you want a man ridding a golden horse to get on one knee and read you the official invite decree? You want them to mail you another invite?", "Any abuse you received from your parents is un-called for and unjust...the way you handled this situation however makes you sound petty and childish.  Not trying to be mean...but you're the one that took this situation to the 'next level' and unwarranted as well.", "ESH, they should've asked for your current address, it would have been fine to call him/text him asking what was up.", "Biggest asshole in history of AITA..", "Yta\n\nHe reached out to you through your parents, then the sister.", "i had the same thing happen to me and I wasn't even estranged from my parents. The cousins never sent me an invite and my mom never passed on the message. She even denied that she didn't tell me. She insisted she did. Mother of the brides knew my address so I don't know what happened.\n\n But it was way too late for me to rsvp or attend.", "Every wedding invite I\u2019ve received, people contacted me to confirm my address. Even the ones who have been to my house and know where I live, they still checked just to make sure.", "That\u2019s insane. They seriously didn\u2019t say anything about it?", "Your situation is one where it makes sense and was handled appropriately. OPs situation was not.", "Same. I\u2019m an adult, if family wants to speak to me or invite me to something, they can contact me, not go through my mum as if I\u2019m a child. It takes setting boundaries for people to get it though.", "Not showing up isn\u2019t a tantrum. People can and do end up not attending a wedding for all manner of reason. It\u2019s not a subpoena.", "Parents typically manage wedding invites to help out. Most likely one of the parents siblings meddling.", "THIS. I\u2019ve been asked this for a baby shower invite just this week\u2026another for an as-yet unidentified reason lol\u2026friends I don\u2019t see all the time have asked if my address is still the same for all sorts of things, including Xmas cards. It\u2019s the safest bet.", "In this case, by not prioritizing OP\u2019s comfort or utilizing their knowledge about OP\u2019s relationship with their parents to create a situation that pressures OP into getting back into contact with them - even if that wasn\u2019t their motivation.\n\nOther motivations can include: not wanting to print more invitations, not bothering to contact OP to get an address, the bride is handling the invitations and Kyle doesn\u2019t keep up with OP and didn\u2019t tell her or just forgot to tell her, OP wasn\u2019t invited and Kyle\u2019s sister just assumed, being so disconnected from OP that Kyle genuinely forgot, being so disconnected from OP that Kyle hasn\u2019t heard because he hasn\u2019t talked about to with his family and scrolled past any Facebook posts about it\u2026", "Bahahaha I have quite a few numbers in my phone of friends and family and I have NO IDEA where they live. \n\nYou clearly have no idea", "Yes! It's gotten to the point now that my mom will tell them straight out that I don't live with them. For many of the family that continue to invite me through my parents, they have that old school mindset that since I'm unmarried, I don't get an invite. Who cares that I'm almost 40 and have lived on my own for almost half my life. /s", "The groom's sister could have been wrong. If the sis was handling this appropriately, she would have advised the groom that OP never received her invite and he needs to call her, providing him OP's phone number that sis has, so groom can make sure OP knows she is invited to the wedding. Wedding etiquette says you never assume your invite as a fact unless it comes directly from the bride or groom. OP did the polite thing. Groom's family knew a month before that she didn't get her invite and never clarified with her. Under those circumstances, I'd assume I wasn't invited too. NTA.", "No way. This is just a phone call between family members. Unless it is the actual bride or groom, it is NOT an explicit invitation.", "That is understandable and I appreciate the response. \n\nI just wonder why OP couldn\u2019t have asked the sister over the phone to resend the invite. Did it really have to be the sisters initiative? I just feel like this all could have been resolved over the phone and the fact that both parties let it fall flat is bizarre to me.\n\nETA: I think this is an NAH situation. Just seems like a massive communication failure", "The post reads \u201cshe explained to me that *my invite* had been sent to my parents house\u201d. That is 100% confirmation that she was invited. \n\nIf receiving a physical invite directly from the bride/groom is so important, why did OP not let her (grooms sister) know what her new address is and ask that it be resent? That\u2019s not rude- they sent the invite to the wrong place and she didn\u2019t receive it. Shit happens and the problem *could* have been resolved. OP chose not to which is fine but she shouldn\u2019t be upset about it.\n\nETA: I think her family leaving her on read is ridiculous but that is neither here nor there.", "How the eff are they supposed to know where to go and when if they have no invite and Kyles sister ghosted them after the initial conversation?", "Someone tried to say that because they don't have an address they probably don't have a number....I laughed alittle too hard", "Only going off what the OP has provided us: at no point did Cousin's Sis announce, hey, I'm handling the RSVPs for Kyle and Bride.  According to the post, the conversation went: \"Hey, are you going to the wedding?\"  It is not clear nor apparent anywhere that Kyle's sister is acting as an wedding invitation coordinator.\n\nThis is all via text, btw - so basically, the conversation sounds like it went in 4 interactions:\n\n1> Hey going to the wedding?\n\n2> What wedding?  (This is KEY!  So many other Y T A comments are talking about OP declining an invitation, and the point is a misdirected invitation is a non-received invitation.)\n\n3> Oh, Kyle (must have?) sent your invitation to your parents' house.\n\n4> (per OP) \"I was never actually invited to the wedding. No one asked me where my address was and I\u2019m not just going to ask Kyle where my invite went and risk inviting myself to the wedding. If he really wanted me there, he would\u2019ve made an effort to contact me himself, therefore I was never actually invited and I won\u2019t be attending.\"\n\nSo, back and forth, with OP being the last text.  No opening in there really for the invitation re-request, address clarification.  Honestly, if Kyle's sis did not jump in with \"OH - I am the RSVP person, you can let me know if you can come\" or \"Well, what is your address? I'll give it to him so he can resend your invitation\" I wouldn't assume she had anything to do with the invitations.  It still reads like a gossip chat between family members if they are going to some upcoming event.  Not an event organizer following up with a potential guest.\n\nOP's last response might have been a bit flip, but honestly 2 years into a no-contact is still within a raw period.\n\nAs far as graciously declining or still attending - if the couple sent out invitations in any kind of lead time way, and Kyle's sis is only 1 month away from the date to follow up on tardy RSVPs, then that's a dropped ball anyway - giving potential guests little to no time to make arrangements. \n\nFrom OP's point of view, she WAS NOT INVITED to an event she DIDN'T KNOW WAS HAPPENING.", "It would have been fine to check with your cousin after his sister said you were invited. Seems like you over thought it. Maybe it was unintentional but your reply to his sister comes across as a bit rude. I would reach out to your cousin, apologize for the miscommunication and wish them well.", "It's possible they might now know. It's possible that they might not have been in charge of sending the invitations out themselves and whoever did wasn't aware either. Op themselves admits they're not close enough to even have each other's phone number.", "She didn't over think it. Dude sent it to an address she hasn't lived at in 8 years. \n\nIt was a way to invite her to appease the family, but make it clear she wasn't actually invited.", "They\u2019ve indicated that they are estranged from parents and have other problematic relatives in comments. Something like this within that context isn\u2019t just a simple mistake. People who have toxic people in their lives know the difference between an accident and being intentionally disrespectful.", "Yeah, the fact that it wasn't even Kyle, but Kyle's sister, that reached out to OP jumped out at me, too. I know I'm in a minority in that I'm close with a large number of cousins, but with that comes the fact that I knew about their weddings for months beforehand \u2013 an invitation would not have been a surprise, but a formality. So Kyle may be distant enough to not know about the estrangement or the multiple moves. Hanlon's razor: never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity (or in this case, ignorance).\n\n(I've told this story before, but when my sister got married, she made a rule that if she or her husband hadn't texted or called you within the last six months, you weren't invited. When they handed it down, one of my cousins, who she sees in person regularly, secretly left the room to text her \u2013 just to make sure!)", "Hell, I wouldn't know half of my cousins if they walked up to me on the street. Some \"family\" is better left by the wayside.", "We really don\u2019t know because OP won\u2019t reply to say if they think this is intentional or not. If it were and they said so the story would make a lot more sense but their unwillingness to answer makes me think not.", "so now you not only can't comprehend what you read but you also don't believe OP and you're psychic?  this woman is only here b/c she is wondering why on earth her family is reacting so poorly to something that Kyle obviously doesn't give a flying fart about, making her second guess herself. i mean, do read the rest the comments - the majority of commenters are also saying NTA, but you do you boo.", "They\u2019ve made many comments explaining things so yeah we do know more of the situation."]}
