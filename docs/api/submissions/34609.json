Her mom says Jane is always on her phone, her grades are falling and she isn\u2019t doing as well as she should be. \n\nJane comes to me, crying, stressed about the pressure her mom is putting on her. Everyone in her household sides with her mom, and she\u2019s never felt more isolated from her own family. I told Jane that communication is important, where both sides are heard. Jane tells me that when they talk, her mom talks over her, and Jane starts crying so much she can\u2019t get a word out.\n\nHer mom wants the best for her, including good grades to get scholarships for good colleges. However, Jane tells me this pressure is too much, and no matter what, they can\u2019t have a proper conversation because it\u2019s always her mom taking control, just as how she does with everything.\n\nSo, with Jane\u2019s permission, I talk to her mom for her. \n\nMe: Jane feels like there\u2019s a lot of pressure on her, too much. She feels almost unsafe talking to you because she\u2019s scared of you. She feels like everything she\u2019s doing is for you, not for her. The first thought on her mind when she gets a test result is \u201cI hope mom is happy about this,\u201d not \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself.\u201d She says she never feels proud because it feels like you\u2019re just constantly raising the bar for her. It\u2019s unrealistic and you need to remember she\u2019s just a kid.\n\nJane\u2019s mom: I worked hard to build this life for her and it would be wasteful if she spent it all on her phone. If I didn\u2019t encourage her to do well, she would do worse, it\u2019s simple. I pay for extra tutoring, buy all the supplies she wants and needs, and I make sure she\u2019s rested enough to study well. I want her to live a good life and that starts with good education. I don\u2019t expect you to understand it yet anyway, you\u2019re young and not a mother yet. You have no right to tell me how to raise my kid, so keep yourself out of my family\u2019s business. You don\u2019t live in our house, so how would you know the real story and not the fabricated one she told you? If she has a problem, she needs to learn how to talk to me about it. She has no reason to be scared, and at her age, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s saying that for attention or to be dramatic.\n\nMe: I think this way of thinking is more harmful than not, but I understand I\u2019m not in your family. However, just letting you know Jane has been crying for weeks about this, and this way of treating your kid is going to end up in her leaving you after she\u2019s 18 with no look back. Believe me or don\u2019t, but I know exactly what\u2019s going through her mind and if you keep up this treatment, she\u2019s going to grow up loving you because you\u2019re her mother, but resenting you because you selfishly prioritized your own love as a mother before her as a person.\n\nNow, I realize how harsh my last words were. \nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m seeing a lot of people (on both sides) say that it\u2019s better for someone licensed to take over. Jane\u2019s mom does not believe in therapy or mental health, and bringing any \u201cdepression\u201d or \u201canxiety\u201d up would have made her more dismissive. She believes they are just emotions you should get over.", "created_utc": 1704738186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191rxzy/aita_for_telling_someone_their_kid_will_leave_them/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As all this was ever going to do is make things worse for Jane, and you could totally have predicted that. \n\nThink about how you would feel if your siblings friend  came over and told you what a shitty sister you were being, do you really think that would have helped make you a better sister? They also tell you they are over because your sibling was too scared to talk to you?   That\u2019s what you did.", "NTA some things need to be said, though it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are heard.", "There is a much better way to handle this than to try and counsel your friend's mother on what you think she's doing wrong. Holy crap.\n\nYTA. If you wanted to make a positive impact you could have gone to her on your friend's behalf saying something like, \"I'm really worried about [friend]. She's not herself and is so upset and depressed all the time,\" thereby alerting the mom to a big issue potentially leading her to get counseling for her daughter.\n\nYou also can support your friend in advocating for herself.\n\nIt's really not your place unless you are a licensed counselor (and even then it's iffy) hired by the family to tell this mother anything.", "Oh please!  I remember whining to my friends when I was like 14-15 about how \"mean\" my mom was.  But I look back at it now, as a parent myself, and I can see that my Mom was 100% right.  Teenagers always think they have it rough and, granted,  some of them legitimately do.  But there is only so long that parents can indulge tender feelings and they need to make the kid apply themselves.  YTA", "YTA. You didn't have a conversation with the mom. You preached at her. The better person to talk to the mom, would have best been her peer, your mom.\n\nThis is water over the dam, so the best you can hope for us that this started a conversation between mother and daughter.", "YTA.\n\nYou have no idea what you are talking about. AS a parent, I will constantly want what's best for my child, not what they want to do. With children it is a constant push towards being better. If my kid is doing something to harm themselves or their future, it is a parents job to pressure them into not making bad choices. This story is the reason my kids will never have a smart phone until they are old enough to drive at the earliest.", "NTA \n\nHang out with Jane sometimes to help her vent", "NTA - You told the truth and you tried to help a minor who asked for it. You made your duty and God knows, few adults would have heard and supported a minor against her parent. Jane's mother doesn't respect her as a person and dismiss her distress instead of listening to her and meeting her needs and changes her own behaviour. She is destroying her relationship wither her child and the self-estime and mental health of her child. So, yes her daugther will suffer for years, if not decades because it and will probably take her distances with her mother once she will be an adult. You offered to this mother an opportunity to fix her parental behaviour. She refused. Big mistake for both her child and herself.", "Holy fuck, YTA. Nothing you're describing here sounds like this mom is doing anything wrong. You didn't help Jane out here; you just stirred the pot.", "You weren\u2019t the AH up until the very end, and now YTA. I think it\u2019s helpful to give her mom the heads up about the situation, she can do with that what she wants. But to then end it with something threatening like that is just going to cause tension. If Jane is going to leave her at 18 with her mom aware of how she\u2019s feeling, well, then her mom will face those consequences and she doesn\u2019t need you to tell her that.", "**NTA**. \n\nYou were just trying to mediate and help Jane out. Her mom seems a bit too focused on her own expectations without considering Jane's feelings. Saying that Jane is just seeking attention or being dramatic is dismissive. Parenting is tough, but understanding your child's perspective is crucial. Maybe your words were a bit harsh, but sometimes a wake-up call is needed. Good on you for looking out for Jane.", "I think you did the right thing. The mom is a bad listener. If the whole family is against Jane then she has been scapegoated and her family dynamic is unhealthy.", "I grew up with a family so strict all three children ran away. There is something to be said with expectations and being infirm as a parent. Don't be that parent.", "YTA. If you were an adult you would know that none of this is any of your business and to stay out of it.", "NTA. It's a cry for help from a teenager that you tried to help. You need to have her go to the school counselor. Someone that can help her navigate things and talk to her mother about the amount of pressure she is under. You will not be heard as just a person, it takes someone a bit higher! Don't stop being there, having someone to vent to is so helpful, but let a licensed person take over.", "NTA\n\nJane gave you permission to speak to Mom. She asked for your intervention, and Mom is clearly presenting that Jane is giving us the solid story with how she responded to you. She doesn't want to see that she's actually not perfect herself, and even tho she thinks she's doing great for her child she's failing them in ways that count.\n\nSure, perhaps her daughter *will* be set up for a great academic future... or as soon as she hits 16 she'll become a druggie burnout. Or she'll leave at 18 and never look back. Who knows.\n\nBut clearly the daughter is struggling and needs support. Counseling or therapy would probably be great - an outside, neutral, licensed and trained ear.", "YTA. Her mom wants to support her, the kid cries because she can't spend every waking moment on her phone. Her mom sounds like she's a great parent. You and other inexperienced teens weaponize the language of therapy (ex. \"she feels unsafe\") rather than learning to cope and meet expectations. The girl is entitled to her feelings of feeling pressured to do well, but that doesn't mean she is right. You need to back off and telling someone their child will never speak to them again when they grow up is both unhelpful and absurd.", "If you feel like you can, maybe acknowledge that you know you aren't the expert on their family, but you're worried about Jane and hope they could try family therapy or at least get Jane into her own therapy.\n\nThen, drop it. You said your piece and all you can do from there is continue to be there for Jane.\n\nNTA, but it's a fine line from here on out.\n\nEdit - deleted an unnecessary paragraph", "NTA. you told her the truth. either her child will leave her when she\u2019s old enough- or she will fall into a depressive hole and leave that way.\n\npressure like this warps a child brain so much. she will constantly believe she\u2019s not good enough. her next failure will be her last if mom isn\u2019t careful.", "YTA. You did not help the situation, and it does not help Jane's mom that she gave up so much for Jane, and Jane worked so hard for her mom. Instead, it would be more helpful if you let them realise the love and work they put in and have for each other.", "YTA.\n\nJane's mom *might* also be an AH, but we have no way of knowing because teenagers are unreliable narrators. It wasn't *super* out of line for you to talk to her mom for her, but your reply when her mom told you to butt out *was* **definitely** inappropriate.", "NTA\n\nI sympathize with mom and child. The only reason I say NTA is because Jane gave you permission.", "NTA. Thank you for being a safe space for Jane to be heard since she isn't being heard at home. Jane's mom is emotionally neglecting her by not listening to her feelings and shutting her down. Long-term, this will have more negative mental health impacts later in life as well. I would send this article to Jane to see if she thinks it resonates with her and if it does, I hope she will consider sharing it with her mom as well as the book Running on Empty by Jonice Webb. https://drjonicewebb.com/are-all-achievement-focused-parents-emotionally-neglectful/\n\nJust because a parent is doing what they think is best for their child doesn't mean that they are performing in a way that is actually best for a still developing child. The consequences of actions don't care about the intentions of the actions when it comes to raising healthy, happy, and confident kids.", "NTA.\n\nThese ur the ah people completely missing this :\n\n>Jane comes to me, crying, stressed about the pressure her mom is putting on her.\n\nA kid literally crying about their parents and they goes \"oh mom is right\".\n\nIts not like the kid do drugs or crime, they need to chill. \n\nPeople need to know kids when they failed in class, its not because they stupid or not study or such. It's because the learning method is not their preference hence why they are dropping grades.\n\nAlso she stressed, that makes it even worse. Go talk to her school counsellor about this. You are not butting in since she cried to you.", "Her mom's concerns don't sound unrealistic or excessive at all. In any case it is literally none of your business how she parents her child. You had no right to say anything at all. \n\nYTA majorly", "NTA you told it like it is.", "I don\u2019t understand the barrage of people calling OP the a-hole here. Especially with the context of the edit in the post, Jane\u2019s mother sounds like a dismissive parent who is pushing back her child\u2019s emotional needs to the least priority over her academic success. It sucks when your parent cares more about your grades and less about your well-being, no matter what their reasons may be.\n\nAnd since Jane has not had access to a professional like a therapist or counsellor, thanks to her mother, she confided in OP and permitted them to represent her side to her mother. So NTA.\n\nIf Jane\u2019s mother keeps this up, either Jane will grow up to be emotionally battered and distant from their mother, or will manage to go LC/NC. This way of parenting a child is not healthy in any way, and cannot be sustained without serious damage.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let Jane's Mom figure it out when Jane does leave her lol.", "Not trying to argue, and I can see your point but would you help me in understanding it better?\n\nFor example, if someone told me I was being a shitty sister and my sibling was scared to talk to me because of how shitty I was being, I would reflect, apologize, and be better. Maybe the way I was approaching things wasn\u2019t right, and I should change. It would hurt of course but I would rather hear it than not.\n\nDo you think it to be more a personality thing? While I would take it upon myself to change, that\u2019s just my personality while you and Jane\u2019s mom would stand firm?", "She said Jane gave her permission to speak to her, she didn't just run right over to her house and start telling mom. Maybe she was hoping an outside voice would give mom time to step back and reflect. It sounds like Jane is on the verge of a break down and needs a spokesperson. Especially if mom doesn't believe in mental health/help.\n\nNTA", "I don't have children, so I'll go with your sibling scenario... if my sister's friend came to tell me my sister is afraid to talk to me, I would be shocked and feel shitty, sure, but I would mostly be concerned about why she would feel that way. I'd be thankful somebody let me know how she was feeling so I could address the issues and make sure she knows she doesn't ever need to be scared of me.

You wouldn't reflect, even for a moment, if maybe there *is* something wrong?", "I disagree. Jane asked for help. OP told the truth. Mom\u2019s complete disregard and lack of curiosity for Jane\u2019s experience was evidence for Jane\u2019s claims. Her mother does not listen to her.", "If someone is too scared to talk to their mother because their mother talks over them to the point they are crying then their mother isn\u2019t going to listen to some outsider. \n\nA mom that can reflect like you say is needed, would have done it the moment she made her daughter cry after screaming at her.", "Agreed. A mom who is more concerned about her daughter's well-being than her own ego, would have responded to OP's input with *concern,* not immediate dismissal."]}
