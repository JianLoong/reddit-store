I took it down because the spiritual point of the altar is partially to let souls know where to visit.\n\nHe came into the living room and asked if the photo had fallen. I said I had taken it down then asked him what he thought was going on on the table. He just went uwu and said \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I said based on context clues (candles, pictures of my dad he knows is dead) that he probably could have guessed SOMETHING was going on. Much less mess it with before asking (sawdust got on my dad\u2019s stuff from him drilling the picture hanging hole) He just kept saying \u201cI didn\u2019t know!\u201d I told him I don\u2019t mind if it goes up in 2 days but the holiday isn\u2019t over. He started fuming with anger because he \u201cdidn\u2019t know.\u201d He eventually started crying and walked to his room.\n\nAITA for assuming he should have talked to me or my wife before putting up unrelated art above my holiday altar?\n\nINFO: This is a small apartment and I do not have any room to do this in my wife & I\u2019s room.
