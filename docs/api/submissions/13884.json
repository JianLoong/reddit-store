She has a volatile personality, got in a lot of trouble in her teenage years for lying, sneaking out, and general disobedience and disrespect.\n\nRecently, it came to light that she is dating a man nearly 20 years older, Thomas [37m]. When I first heard I assumed he was a lowlife who was using her and my wife and I wanted the relationship to end instantly.\n\nHowever, based on how volatile and stubborn Sara is when it comes to getting her way we knew we couldn't just forbid her so we allowed her to bring him over for dinner so we could at least meet him and try to size him up.\n\nAfter meeting him, I have realized he is not actually a creep, just a moron. Throughout the dinner he talked a lot about the ninja turtles and about pro wrestling, which appear to be his only interests. He has no real achievements in his life, simply working various dead end minimum wage jobs and told us that his lifelong ambition is to one day own a fireworks stand.\n\nI no longer am worried about the relationship because I simply don't believe Thomas is capable of manipulating or taking advantage of Sara and if anything, I am more worried about her taking advantage of him as he seems to be shockingly naive and childlike for someone nearly 40.\n\nMy wife on the other hand is mad at me because I wont back her up and thinks I am condoning my daughter throwing away her future. I said to my wife that Sara's future is in her own hands and Thomas is much nicer and more likeable than almost every other guy sara has brought home and that all things considered, the situation is nowhere near as bad as we had first assumed.\n\nBut my wife says I am an asshole for not backing her up and not 'protecting' my daughter like a father should.

Then with her proposal you invited him and think that he isn\u2019t that bad. Even if you think it is bad I think it is her life and choose who she lives with.(If there is no physical contact)", "NTA, \nAs a mum I\u2019d be very concerned about a big age gap, however, besides locking your child in the basement there\u2019s not much you can do besides say you\u2019re concerned about the age gap.\nYou want her to come to you when and if there is an issue directly and quickly so keep the lines of communication open.", "NTA. I think this could be the most mature and considered post I've ever read on this sub. Given the last 25 years of U.S. history your daughters bloke could well make president one day and you'll be able to tell your wife that you told her so.", "The thing is, issue is on your problematic daughter.\n\nShe is obviously immature and may be using this guy for her needs. for whatever it is, he is happily using your daughter for free sex. \n\nWhat if she gets pregnant, can this 'moron' step up and takes care of her?..financially especially. Are they using drugs?\n\nIf he cant, I guess it will fall on you and your wife.", "NTA. You can\u2019t do anything about her and honestly your disapproval might push her further into this relationship. \n\nBut. If she does get a good job, and stay with this man, he may financially take advantage of her. Quit his job and just bum off her. But that\u2019s only if the relationship lasts.", "NTA though this is pretty funny.\n\nI suggest you tell your daughter that you approve of her relationship and that you're not worried about this guy, because he is a moron with no ambition and no future.\n\nI have a feeling that she might start re-evaluating the relationship on her own.", "Yes, unfortunately you can't do anything at this point. You have expressed your opinion. Maybe your daughter feels protective of this guy. Hopefully she won't get caught up in the same low paying jobs that the bf is in. NTA.", "NTA. Even if you wanted to back your wife up, how exactly does she plan on forbidding her dating him? Kick her out? That'll only take away your wife's opportunity to snoop around and it'll push your daughter right into Thomas' arms.\n\nShe's a legal adult and continuing to treat her like someone you can control is only going to hurt your relationship with her.", "NTA.  You *can't* protect her at this point anyway.", "NTA, in the end you invited him to dinner to feel him out because you knew you could never DO anything in the first place.\n\nHe came to dinner.  You and your wife both found him to be, if not a nice guy, definitely someone you did not think was trying to manipulate/control your daughter.  I think a really good rule is to be polite always--this will allow her to hear you later if there is a real situation later or in a future relationship.\n\nI don't think there's much of him to take advantage of either from your description.\n\nI'm 43 and I lived to shock my ma.  I brought home some dates just to fuck with her.  When I found no race, gender mohawk pissed her off I also learned it was safe to bring my interests home.  If she had stressed me I would have stopped.\n\nI'm still single and my mom still meets a bf now or then. She is always welcoming and when it is over she will say one of these:. That's too bad, he was a nice guy. Or hmm, I never liked that one.\n\nThe most important thing is creating an environment where your daughter wants you involved in her life.  That doesn't happen if you are too critical of life choices that don't affect you.", "NTA.   I be more concerned that his life long ambition is to have a fireworks stand.\nCan he even support himself?", "NTA - is your daughter throwing her life away for this guy? Has she given up studying or is taking drugs? If not don\u2019t worry about, let it play out, she will get over him when she\u2019s ready.", "Nta it\u2019s possible he is developmentally delayed. Some are pretty high functioning and yet\u2026.", "I think you as a parent should be worried that your youngest is dating someone so much older.. at least be wary or a little bit concerned? But well theres not much you can do otherwise unfortunately just be wary at the very least thats a huge age gap for someone so young", "You should reassure your wife that you approving of the boyfriend is a sure way of your daughter losing interest in him. NAH", "NTA, but you're kind of a judgy jerk. I'm 41 and I like the Ninja Turtles and wrestling. Am I a \"moron\" too? XD\n\nBut for reals, despite my personal feelings of butthurt, you're NTA. Let the relationship happen. It may not last, who knows? It may be that being with your daughter seriously makes Thomas step up and try to be a better provider (unless he's making enough at his current job already.)", "NTA\n\nShe may be the one taking advantage of him, and there is nothing you can do about it other than harass him.  Is that what your wife expects you to do?", "YTA", "YTA.  \n  You are the parent, so parent her. She\u2019s a pain in the ass cause you\u2019ve previously done a poor job of parenting. Step up now, before you lose her.  \n  She\u2019s being used for sex by an old man, regardless of wether or not he\u2019s an idiot, he\u2019s still a creep. Get her out of there, suck up the ensuing drama and if necessary go to therapy together. You created this situation, it is absolutely your responsibility to support and empower her out of it.  \n  She\u2019s likely looking for a daddy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
