{"id": 3690, "submission_id": "z9xpl1", "title": "AITA for being a picky eater at Friendsgiving?", "selftext": "Hi all. Throwaway account.\n\nI (26F) joined a group of friends I met in grad school. We range anywhere from 23 - 30, and we're a mix of men and women. I was bullied out of my old friend group so I started hanging out with the current group since February. They have all been friends longer than I have, so I'm like the new addition.\n\nFor the last couple years, they do Friendsgiving, which is usually a week or 2 before Thanksgiving, and we all bring a dish/drink to someone's house. This year a girl, \"Lisa\", said she would host since her and her fiance just moved into a big condo. We were all assigned to bring something, but it didn't have to be Thanksgiving-themed, any food would do (which defeats the purpose of Thanksgiving, but whatever, I'm not the hostess).\n\nNow I've always been a picky eater. I don't have allergies or anything, but I know what I like and I'm not interested in trying new foods. That may offend some people but that's just who I am. We had a Google Doc for who was bringing what, and I quickly realized I wouldn't be able to eat anything except bread rolls and apple pie (and I was bringing the pie!). There was a lot of foreign food, since most of the friend group comes from diverse backgrounds, some examples are Lisa is Chinese so she was going to make Chinese BBQ pork and steam a whole fish, another person's family is Lebanese so they were going to bring hummus, parsley salad, etc.\n\nI googled the foods I didn't know and none of that sounded appetizing to me, so I texted Lisa and asked her if she could provide something for me to eat so I didn't starve. She asked me what I was thinking, so I provided her with some options, such as pizza, burgers, spaghetti with meat sauce, etc. She said she would.\n\nSo I go to Friendsgiving and everyone starts to help themselves, and Lisa brings me out a pizza. I asked her where my other options were, and she says there are no other options, I said I liked pizza, so she got me a pizza. I felt this was unfair because everyone had a variety to choose from and I was essentially being forced to eat 1 thing.\n\nWe got into an argument. I told her when I gave her a list of options, I expected her to have a few different ones for me, like a good hostess would do. She said no, why should she provide a bunch of food (I never said a bunch) for just 1 person. No one stood up for me and a couple people even sided with Lisa, saying I was acting spoiled. I ended up in tears and left early without eating anything. Lisa wouldn't even give me back the pie I brought, which was unnecessarily mean.\n\nThat was a couple weeks ago, and everyone is ignoring me (granted, it's nearing the end of the semester so we've all been busy). I'm starting to feel that there was a miscommunication between Lisa and I, but I wanted to see if anyone would side with me. My friends are aware I only like a few foods, and I feel like I'm being bullied for my tastes. I'm super anxious and upset and can't focus on my finals, so Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m the asshole. I sent Lisa a text asking to talk and she hasn\u2019t responded. I also texted another girl in the group who said they\u2019re having a post-finals New Year\u2019s party and I\u2019m not invited. So there\u2019s that.\n\nEdit and Update: Lisa texted me back saying she was sorry about the pie, but she\u2019s not sorry for the Friendsgiving as a whole. I asked her about the NYE party and she said her and the group think it would be best if I didn\u2019t come because of how I acted. I can\u2019t say I blame them but I\u2019m heartbroken.\n\nEdit again: please stop messaging me calling me fat ass, autistic, etc. you\u2019re never too old to learn a lesson.\n\nUpdate: I texted an apology to the group chat, and I offered to take everyone out to dinner at a Chinese restaurant after finals are over. Will update if anything changes. Tomorrow I am going to order takeout from somewhere I\u2019ve never ordered before.", "created_utc": 1669924246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9xpl1/aita_for_being_a_picky_eater_at_friendsgiving/", "score": 15435, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not just a picky eater, you're a rude guest. Not surprising that you're probably being dropped.\n\nIt was already a pot luck, so you could have brought anything you like to eat. As much of whatever you wanted. You chose pie. \n\nThen you had the nerve to tell the hostess to get you a specific food because you didn't see anything you wanted on the spreadsheet. She got you a pizza which was on your list. You think she should have gotten you several things, seriously?\n\nI'm shocked that you are in your mid-20s and have managed a social life with these kind of food demands. It won't be the last time others have an issue with this.", "YTA.\n\nHint: you're not being bullied. You\u2019re getting social blowback and consequences for acting very poorly. \n\nFirst, you didn't realize it was all food you couldn't eat. You realized it was food you don't want to eat. Stop making it seem more than a matter of taste.\n\nSecond, Lisa complied with your request by making a dish that she knew you could eat. Expecting the host to provide you with multiple options at a potluck, including pizza and burgers and spaghetti and more is flat out unreasonable and you causing a scene because of it is entitled, unhinged, and gross. How embarrassing for everyone there to have to witness it and for you to have done it in the first place. \n\nThird, it's not a problem of miscommunication, it's a problem of your unreasonable expectations and rude behavior.\n\nGet some anxiety meds, get through your finals, and look for new friends. These ones rightly don't want anything to do with you.

If you're that picky of an eater, then bring your own food. And after she was nice enough to provide you with an option, you criticize her?", "YTA.  This is the price of being a picky eater.  Everyone else had options because everyone else was willing to be flexible.  Lisa could\u2019ve just told you to bring your own food if you weren\u2019t sure you could eat anything else people were planning to bring, but she made sure you\u2019d be fed.  The correct response to that is \u201cthank you.\u201d", "YTA and I can see why you were \u201cbullied\u201d out of your old friend group. You are acting entitled. It\u2019s unrealistic to think a host would provide multiple food options for one person.\n\nEdited to add: I\u2019m putting bullied in quotations because I doubt they actually did bully you. You are describing Lisa as bullying you when she is acting reasonable and you are acting entitled.", "YTA. You're an adult and it's on you to make sure you have something to eat. You gave them options and they got you a pizza. If you're being picky that's on you.", "YTA - If you aren't going to eat what is provided, don't expect ONE friend to provide an entirely alternative meal just because you are picky. \n\nShe already got you a pizza, and IMO if you weren't going to eat, you should have been bringing your OWN food rather than act like an entitled AH who expected to be served something completely different.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, Thanksgiving food doesn\u2019t need to be strictly Turkey and mashed potatoes and stuffing. \n\nSecond, why not bring a dish you can eat, instead of a pie? You brought plenty of audacity to assume the host would provide extra food JUST FOR YOU, which she did. A pizza. Like you said you liked. She\u2019s not obligated to provide more food just because she\u2019s hosting, when the deal was everyone brings something.

Being entitled does.\n\nLisa was kind enough to organize a Pizza for you. And you still expected her to organize a whole variety of food for you. The meaning of sharing food is that no one has the burden to prepare and pay for a whole meal. You put that burden on Lisa by expecting her to give you a variety of food. Why didn't you bring more food that you liked?\n\nYTA.", "YTA are you sure you were bullied out of your original group or that is how you explain them not dealing with your sense of entitlement?", "Info: Why do you have the taste buds of a 10 year old and how do you decide you don't like the flavor of something by googling it?\n\nYTA - the world doesn't revolve around you and you're unnecessary attempts to be difficult.", "YTA, you expected a smorgasbord of dishes for just yourself? Entitled much?", "You are surely kidding? So because you have the diet of a twelve-year-old brat, she has to provide MULTIPLE options for you to choose from over the wonderful buffet of world foods available to you? You have a lot of expectations of Lisa as a host, but zero expectations of how to show up as a guest. Good Lord. Your best options would have been to bring some food yourself seeing as you consider the other options beneath you, or to simply not come. In fact, just don\u2019t go next time and save the other people your entitled shenanigans. \n\nYTA. Big time.", "YTA. You are one person, a picky eater, going to someone *else\u2019s home* and think it\u2019s unfair that there\u2019s not food for you? Lisa isn\u2019t your chef, she is taking time to host a gathering. Bring your own food if you have difficulties with new or foreign foods. \n\nBtw, one person\u2019s foreign or \u201cweird\u201d food is someone else\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201chome\u201d food. My Middle Eastern mom thinks American style hummus is dry and bland \u2014 even shameful to serve others, but I\u2019m sure that hasn\u2019t stopped folks from thinking it tastes great and bringing it to parties. And people do, and there\u2019s nothing wrong about it. And she will eat it if that\u2019s what\u2019s there, as a proper guest. \n\nEdit: the fact you were also looking to see if someone sided with you over Lisa, like\u2026 the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "YTA: Lisa went out of her way to provide an extra option just so you would have something to eat. It was bold of you to ask her to have a separate option for you, much less several options.

Don't want to try anything new and instead live your life in stagnation? Fantastic, don't make it other people's problem and shut your mouth and eat some pie.", "Clearly, YTA. You sent her a list of options because you were too picky to do what everyone else was doing, and you expected her to buy you multiple of the options? That\u2019s ridiculous. No one would ever think that was what you meant or what she was expected to do. She did you a favor by purchasing an additional dish that only you would eat, and complied with the option list.\n\nYou\u2019re not being bullied because of your tastes. You\u2019re being ignored because you acted unreasonably and maybe they don\u2019t want to hang out with you. If you want to repair this friendship, you should contact Lisa and apologize immediately.\n\n*Edit. So, you added the edits\u2026 but you didn\u2019t say that you apologized profusely about how you acted and you want to make it up to her, etc etc. Please tell me you did that, and you just omitted it from your edits because it\u2019s so obvious that\u2019s what you needed to do.", "YTA\n\nYour host graciously provided you with something you would eat so that you would be fed.  That was going above and beyond as a hostess, since for a large meal like this, all she would have been required to do was allow *you* to bring your own meal.  Especially when there are no medical issues involved and just a dislike of \"foreign\" food (lmao like pizza isn't), she wasn't required to provide you with anything at all.  \n\nActing like you were entitled to be provided with a main and sides specifically for your tastes is *beyond* spoiled and self-centered.  If you wanted additional options you could eat, you should have brought them yourself with enough to share.", "YTA I guess we know why you were \u201cbullied\u201d out of your old group.  There was a big list and yet you expected someone else to provide a \u201cvariety\u201d for you? And you just brought an apple pie? Why didn\u2019t you bring a couple of things then?  If you want to eat bland food then BYO. \n\nDon\u2019t expect everyone to cater for your extremely narrow needs - start trying to broaden your horizons or expect to be spending a lot of time alone. \n\nI don\u2019t think it matters now - but think about it for the next \u201cfriends\u201d group as I doubt you are in this one any more.", "LMFAO you saying you got bullied out of your other friend group seems a little sus after reading this post. You sound like a difficult friend to have. Of course YTA. If you wanted food to eat \u201cso you didn\u2019t starve\u201d (dramatic but ok) , you should have brought something for yourself. Your friend was hosting a potluck. Which means she was hosting as far as *where* the event was held, and she was not responsible for providing food beyond what she had planned.

Why didn't you just bake some chicken and throw it in some Tupperware with rice and veggies?\n\nYou acknowledge that this is how you are. Well then potlucks aren't for you. Never expect the world to conform to your severely limited palate. You have to bring your own bland ass food to parties. You weren't being a good friend here.

It was entirely fair, food was provided, and they did compensate for you. Maybe i'm just simple but a decent pizza would have been more than enough food to get me through a dinner.

You're not being bullied. And I have my doubts that you were bullied out of your old friend group.", "YTA.

But that's the point, you do you. It was great the host provided something EXTRA for you. But if you wanted to have more options you should have brought it. Even if you had to deal with ppl telling you that you were an ah for not bringing enough to share. It would be far better to deal with that then to put your wants (for no other reason than \"its the way you are\") on others. It's the way you are, not anyone else. Either try new things, deal with what you can eat, or make sure you take care of you.\n\nBTW. It wouldn't matter if this was new friends, old friends, or family, it would all result in the same, you are responsible for you.\n\n\nEdit to add: I am saying this without any malice or to be mean or anything of the sort. You should try to open yourself to trying new foods. Things that you don't know may notnsound the best when you read recipes or what they are online, but be a totally different experience when you try then. Trying them doesn't mean you have to put a bunch on your plate. You can put a tiny little bit, just enough to get a taste. If you don't like it, you don't like it and nothing (or nothing much) went to waste. When I met my husband he had a very similar response to food. He liked what he liked and didn't want to try new things. Income from a family where we eat many different types of food and try new things all the time. After over a decade of being together his pallete has changed. I never tried to pressure him (to much, I will admit I did a little but that was only bc he was my bf/fiance/husband, I wouldn't have pushed the same ifnit had been a friend or anyone else) to try things he wasn't used to. He has new favorite foods, and these are things he never thought he would eat in the first place. While he may not be as excited as I get over trying new things, he does do it and has thanked me for opening him up to things he wasn't used to or never thought he'd like before. I realized with him that he felt like there was some expectation that he HAD to like whatever he tried. And that's not true (and never let anyone bully you about it needing to be like that). But you never know what you may or may not like if you don't try something. While you need to do what your comfortable with, getting out of your comfort zone just to see (could be food, clothes, experience or anything) may open yourself up to a part of you that you never knew existed or could exist.", "I'm a picky eater too who has the same pasta every holiday while everyone else enjoy different foods and you're just rude.

Having the pizza would have been a nice bonus treat...something you could have appreciated.\n\nInstead, you threw a temper tantrum and possibly got yourself booted from the friendgroup.\n\nI know this is not what you wanted to hear, but it's what you need to hear.\n\nIt's time to either figure out a way to try new things....or it's time to accept that this is how your life will be moving forward.", "YTA---GROW UP!", "Wow.

In these situations, I always feel like im the one being rude by not eating the food that is provided. I would never insist that a host buys multiple food options specifically for me. There were 3 options for you there, including one thing that someone went out of their way to get you as per your request. Since this is an event where everyone was bringing their own food, theres no reason why you couldnt bring multiple options that you would enjoy. For you to ask the host to supply multiple things specifically for you shows an incredible amount of entitlement. At the big age of 26 you should know better.

Throwaway account.\n\nI (26F) joined a group of friends I met in grad school. We range anywhere from 23 - 30, and we're a mix of men and women. I was bullied out of my old friend group so I started hanging out with the current group since February. They have all been friends longer than I have, so I'm like the new addition.\n\nFor the last couple years, they do Friendsgiving, which is usually a week or 2 before Thanksgiving, and we all bring a dish/drink to someone's house. This year a girl, \"Lisa\", said she would host since her and her fiance just moved into a big condo. We were all assigned to bring something, but it didn't have to be Thanksgiving-themed, any food would do (which defeats the purpose of Thanksgiving, but whatever, I'm not the hostess).\n\nNow I've always been a picky eater. I don't have allergies or anything, but I know what I like and I'm not interested in trying new foods. That may offend some people but that's just who I am. We had a Google Doc for who was bringing what, and I quickly realized I wouldn't be able to eat anything except bread rolls and apple pie (and I was bringing the pie!). There was a lot of foreign food, since most of the friend group comes from diverse backgrounds, some examples are Lisa is Chinese so she was going to make Chinese BBQ pork and steam a whole fish, another person's family is Lebanese so they were going to bring hummus, parsley salad, etc.\n\nI googled the foods I didn't know and none of that sounded appetizing to me, so I texted Lisa and asked her if she could provide something for me to eat so I didn't starve. She asked me what I was thinking, so I provided her with some options, such as pizza, burgers, spaghetti with meat sauce, etc. She said she would.\n\nSo I go to Friendsgiving and everyone starts to help themselves, and Lisa brings me out a pizza. I asked her where my other options were, and she says there are no other options, I said I liked pizza, so she got me a pizza. I felt this was unfair because everyone had a variety to choose from and I was essentially being forced to eat 1 thing.\n\nWe got into an argument. I told her when I gave her a list of options, I expected her to have a few different ones for me, like a good hostess would do. She said no, why should she provide a bunch of food (I never said a bunch) for just 1 person. No one stood up for me and a couple people even sided with Lisa, saying I was acting spoiled. I ended up in tears and left early without eating anything. Lisa wouldn't even give me back the pie I brought, which was unnecessarily mean.\n\nThat was a couple weeks ago, and everyone is ignoring me (granted, it's nearing the end of the semester so we've all been busy). I'm starting to feel that there was a miscommunication between Lisa and I, but I wanted to see if anyone would side with me. My friends are aware I only like a few foods, and I feel like I'm being bullied for my tastes. I'm super anxious and upset and can't focus on my finals, so Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She got one thing from the list which was generous already because she most definitely could have brought her own item(s) to eat. Op Y T A for sure.

It makes me think that OP would have been OK with \"traditional\" Thanksgiving foods since so many of them fit her bland, tasteless palate.", "I dunno, if OP pulled this at my Friendsgiving, I\u2019d be inclined to bully her too.

She does sound exhausting indeed.", "I just like what I like. Trying new foods just isn't appealing to me. My family and I grew up in a very white town and only ate the same couple of things every week, and that's what I've carried with me into adulthood.

I'm not going to make myelf throw up.", "Yeah, I\u2019m guessing it has not escaped the notice of the other attendees that all the stuff OP refuses to even sample just happens to be non-Western in origin.", "I think keeping the pie was fair - given that it was a pot luck and OP was responsible for  desert. Leaving with her pie would've left all the other contributing people without a piece of the promised meal.", "I agree it's kind of a gray area, but it's super rude to bring something to a potluck and take it back.", "agreed i can\u2019t believe how RUDE and entitled OP is, i wouldn\u2019t ever talk to her again\u2026YTA OP, wow!", "I was thinking the same thing.

I'm not vegetarian but a large percentage of my people are. I've long hosted a \"hobos and orphans\" Thanksgiving. Everyone and anyone is welcome to stop in but the whole point is for singletons, divorcees, and folks without local family to have a fun place to indulge their most gluttonous inclinations. \n\nMost people bring dishes, but they don't have to. I prepare a turkey, dressing, gravy, and cranberry sauce (never canned, yuck.) I make two kinds of mashed potatoes, vegan and vegetarian w/ butter and milk. I always make a large pot of vegan friendly fare like curry lentils or chickpea Tikka masala and rice. \n\nMy guests bring food as well. With family and work obligations people tend to show up in waves and eat all afternoon and evening. This year, as an example, guests also brought a ham, a smoked turkey, tofurkey, and a veggie lasagna. Obviously there were a ton of desserts, side dishes, salads, and appetizers too. \n\nIt's okay to have a restrictive diet, but you've got to take ownership on how you address that issue.", "I like apple pie and I would have eaten it. No one had signed up for desserts on the Google list so that's why I selected that.", "I\u2019m starting to think that OP thinks people holding their boundaries and not putting up with their entitled attitude is bullying", "My thoughts exactly!", "I don't have any problem with ethnic foods.

That's just absurd!", "But she could easily have brought a big dish of spaghetti and shared it!", "Wondering, why this is so far down in the comments.

This is totally on you. Be a grown up.", "She DID provide something for you. Pizza. How is this difficult to understand?", "She did provide something for you. You wanted options. You're the problem. If you wanted more options, you could have brought something.", "You are not getting the point! She is essentially hosting a potluck not a complete meal that she cooks for everyone. That means everyone is responsible for something. If you knew you would be a baby and not even try anything, you shouldn't be told you needed to bring something! You should make the obvious decision to bring 1 or 2 dishes that you know you like instead of a fricking pie. The fact she accommodated you by having the pizza is a lot and obviously lost on you.", "You were invited to bring something and you brought pie!", "She DID provide something for you.", "Same here.

Now I love sushi, Indian food, etc. You really have no excuse here. If you aren't going to try things, you have to provide for yourself or deal with being hungry. You have no right to be mad at anyone else for your self-inflicted pain here.", "It's really not a privilege thing though - I was a picky eater as a kid and still am on the picky side (like when i order sandwiches at restaurants I usually have to ask for an item or two to be left off because I don't like them) but expanding your palate as an adult is a choice you can make! I wouldn't have touched hummus as a teen or young adult but now I eat it all the time. My younger sister used to be even pickier than I am and now she is an adult and the most adventurous eater I know. I know food aversions exist, but it wouldn't hurt you to try some things that you hadn't before. You don't have to eat things you already know you don't like but if you've never had the bbq pork (or whatever), what's the harm if you try it alongside a roll and some pie?", "Where do I begin? So many things wrong here.\n\n\"Not everyone is privileged to have a varied food education growing up.\"\n\nWell, you were given the privilege of varied foods at Thanksgiving and instead were a pain the the ass and turned your nose at dishes that mean something to your friends.  If you wanted other foods, bring them yourself.  To ask the hostess to provide additional food is so entitled. She was gracious enough to provide you pizza and instead of thanking her you comment there was only one!  And then you want to take your pie with you after throwing a fit.   Good lord, you're a piece of work. \n\nTotal AH.  Grow up.", "Hi, formerly picky eater here. I too grew up in a very white town in a family with a limited budget. I kept up my picky eating until I was a teenager and turns out, I didn\u2019t have the palate of a child anymore, and things I\u2019d previously tried and didn\u2019t like tasted good, and things I\u2019d never tried before tasted good as well! And some things I still didn\u2019t like or didn\u2019t enjoy upon tasting it for the first time. If you never try anything new, you\u2019ll never know what you might like. You are limiting yourself as a human being by sticking to the palate of a child. Unless you have something like undiagnosed ADHD or autism, there is absolutely no reason why you should not try new things, barring allergies of course, which you say you don\u2019t have. \n\nI know it\u2019s scary and intimidating at first. But the good news is, if you try something one time, and you don\u2019t like it, then you never have to eat it again. YTA, dear, and you should apologize to Lisa and her fianc\u00e9, as well as the rest of your friend group, if you want to have a chance of staying friends with them.", "That is fine, but you are really cheating yourself out of some great potential pleasure.  Maybe try to expand your palate in ways that feel safe to you.  If you like noodles, try some Chinese noodle dishes.  Or pad thai, which is a very accessible Thai noodle dish.  It is sad you aren't willing to expand your palate at all.", "Time to grow up. That's not an excuse for remaining super picky, your family CHOSE to have the same meals over & over, the same ingredients that it takes to make them also makes 100 other things. Sounds like y'all are just content eating the same thing & have no taste.", "PRIVILEGED to have a varied food education!?  Being a picky eater is 100% a choice, not some travesty forced on you!  Growing up we more or less ate the same things over and over never going out of a very small comfort zone.  I CHOOSE to not be that way.  You are nothing more than an entitled spoiled brat who needs to grow up!  Why in the world do you think you should expect/insist that \"the host\" should get you multiple entrees when it's a freaking pot luck dinner!?  It's very obvious why you lost your last friend group, and from the sounds of it, your new one too! \n\nBy the way, you are way huge YTA !!!!", "Look, I get it. Grew up similarly although it was because my mom had a lot of food-related trauma and that along with poverty basically pushed us to eat the same 5 flavors of Hamburger Helper and mashed potato flakes and barely seasoned pork chops for practically every meal, and trying new foods was often met with disdain. However, after I moved out and in with my now husband, I was thrown into a world of new foods. It scared me, and even now there's still plenty I won't eat (namely fish due to an aversion), but I don't regret taking the steps I dud because now I actually enjoy food instead of just seeing it as a means to stay alive. I won't say to just throw yourself out there, but you should try and be more open minded and give new things a shot. It doesn't need to be big. Just a different form of things you enjoy, like pizza or spaghetti, can be enough.\n\nUltimately, if you don't want to try new things, that's your choice. However, you shouldn't expect your friends to then cater exclusively to your aversions and force themselves to either limit what they enjoy or make more that you would only really benefit from. If you knew from the list that you wouldn't eat anything there, you could've offered to bring your own food. Yes, Lisa is the host, but it sounds like the meal was a potluck.

The behavior you showed in this story was shockingly selfish, entitled, and rude. Some people will ice you out for it, and others may actually be rude to you back. But when you behave in demanding self-centered way then cry and act the victim beacuse not enough catering towards you has occurred, people aren't going to like that. And they aren't going to like you.\n\nYTA, but you may have many other good qualities. Still, this shows a serious lack of social awareness and consideration for others. Acting like this will continue to mess up your life and push people away. If this is surprising to you, I don't know, see a therapist about social skills training or something?\n\nHere is what you did wrong:\n\n* Refusing to so much as try anything anyone else brought beacuse they not white American foods is already not great, and will make you look bad to many people. This is going to make you seen as immature and possibly sort of racist by some people. In many cultures, this is seen as rude. (Less bad then your other behavior, which 100% of people see as rude.)\n* You don't call your host and complain you don't like the menu. No one said you are forced to attend, or that you are forced to eat. Generally, telling other people you don't like any of their cooking is rude and just not necessary. Most people would be polite enough to give something a small try, or at least not mention they dislike their cooking. It's like if your friend is fat. You don't say \"wow, you're fat\". Criticisms can be kept to yourself. \n* You don't call your host and demand they make you special dishes just for you. If you don't like what your host is kindly offering you, don't eat it. It's that simple. This isn't a restaurant. Your host is not your caterer. You aren't paying them to make what you want. Rather, they are spending their money to provide you with food as a gift, and you don't demand gifts. Also very rude.\n* Even worse, this was a potluck. It was a potluck and somehow you thought it was Lisa's job to make MULTIUPLE extra dishes just for you? Why? This is mind-bogglingly greedy on your part. Why can't you buy your own extra dishes? Why on earth did you ask her to do so? She was already admirably patient and generous to buy you a pizza you were too cheap and lazy to bring yourself. It is in no way shape or form Liza's job to buy your special food options *at a potlock* when you can just bring them yourself? \n* Not only did you expect Lisa to make and serve extra dishes just for you, when she did you got upset she \"only\" bought you a pizza? She already spent her money on a pizza you demanded beacuse you apparently refuse to pay for it yourself like an adult. But no, that's not enough. She needs to buy and spend time making multiple extra things just to serve you??? \n* You made a public scene over Lisa not being a good host. This was not helped by the fact you were 100% in the wrong and I would be correcting my toddler if they acted as entitled as you. But just in general, on top of not complaining, you also shouldn't make a scene of complaining in front of everyone.\n* You cried and ran off when you were only given an entire extra pizza no one else got for being super picky, whining, and making greedy demands of poor Lisa. You acted like you were the victim and failed to handle the situation like a mature adult. People don't want to deal with this level of drama, it is not fun for anyone\n\nIf you act like this of course no one is going to want you at the next event. You were an ungrateful demanding burden on your host, meaning she'd have been happier if you weren't there. Every single thing you did, you thought about yourself, what you wanted, what was good for you. You did not think about how your behavior would make other people feel. You did not think about the the time or money you were asking others to spend to humor and cater to you instead of providing for yourself. You wanted something, so others have to work and pay to give it to you (why??). You didn't think about how upsetting or embarrassing it would be to Lisa for you to argue and criticize her hosting in front of everyone. You didn't think about how it would make  others feel to insult everything they make and their cultures. You didn't think how uncomfortable your behavior is for everyone else. You talked about how things \"weren't fair\" to you, but you expected another person to completely take care of what you wanted for you like you were there small child. And you didn't consider what was fair to Lisa, why it would be fair for her to have to pay for and prepare several extra dishes just for you when you could only be bothered to bring one?
