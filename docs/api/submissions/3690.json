{"id": 3690, "submission_id": "z9xpl1", "title": "AITA for being a picky eater at Friendsgiving?", "selftext": "Hi all. Throwaway account.\n\nI (26F) joined a group of friends I met in grad school. We range anywhere from 23 - 30, and we're a mix of men and women. I was bullied out of my old friend group so I started hanging out with the current group since February. They have all been friends longer than I have, so I'm like the new addition.\n\nFor the last couple years, they do Friendsgiving, which is usually a week or 2 before Thanksgiving, and we all bring a dish/drink to someone's house. This year a girl, \"Lisa\", said she would host since her and her fiance just moved into a big condo. We were all assigned to bring something, but it didn't have to be Thanksgiving-themed, any food would do (which defeats the purpose of Thanksgiving, but whatever, I'm not the hostess).\n\nNow I've always been a picky eater. I don't have allergies or anything, but I know what I like and I'm not interested in trying new foods. That may offend some people but that's just who I am. We had a Google Doc for who was bringing what, and I quickly realized I wouldn't be able to eat anything except bread rolls and apple pie (and I was bringing the pie!). There was a lot of foreign food, since most of the friend group comes from diverse backgrounds, some examples are Lisa is Chinese so she was going to make Chinese BBQ pork and steam a whole fish, another person's family is Lebanese so they were going to bring hummus, parsley salad, etc.\n\nI googled the foods I didn't know and none of that sounded appetizing to me, so I texted Lisa and asked her if she could provide something for me to eat so I didn't starve. She asked me what I was thinking, so I provided her with some options, such as pizza, burgers, spaghetti with meat sauce, etc. She said she would.\n\nSo I go to Friendsgiving and everyone starts to help themselves, and Lisa brings me out a pizza. I asked her where my other options were, and she says there are no other options, I said I liked pizza, so she got me a pizza. I felt this was unfair because everyone had a variety to choose from and I was essentially being forced to eat 1 thing.\n\nWe got into an argument. I told her when I gave her a list of options, I expected her to have a few different ones for me, like a good hostess would do. She said no, why should she provide a bunch of food (I never said a bunch) for just 1 person. No one stood up for me and a couple people even sided with Lisa, saying I was acting spoiled. I ended up in tears and left early without eating anything. Lisa wouldn't even give me back the pie I brought, which was unnecessarily mean.\n\nThat was a couple weeks ago, and everyone is ignoring me (granted, it's nearing the end of the semester so we've all been busy). I'm starting to feel that there was a miscommunication between Lisa and I, but I wanted to see if anyone would side with me. My friends are aware I only like a few foods, and I feel like I'm being bullied for my tastes. I'm super anxious and upset and can't focus on my finals, so Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1669924246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9xpl1/aita_for_being_a_picky_eater_at_friendsgiving/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not just a picky eater, you're a rude guest. Not surprising that you're probably being dropped.\n\nIt was already a pot luck, so you could have brought anything you like to eat. As much of whatever you wanted. You chose pie. \n\nThen you had the nerve to tell the hostess to get you a specific food because you didn't see anything you wanted on the spreadsheet. She got you a pizza which was on your list. You think she should have gotten you several things, seriously?\n\nI'm shocked that you are in your mid-20s and have managed a social life with these kind of food demands. It won't be the last time others have an issue with this.", "YTA.\n\nHint: you're not being bullied. Your getting social blowback and consequences for acting very poorly. \n\nFirst, you didn't realize it was all food you couldn't eat. You realized it was food you don't want to eat. Stop making it seem more than a matter of taste.\n\nSecond, Lisa complied with your request by making a dish that she knew you could eat. Expecting the host to provide you with multiple options at a potluck, including pizza and burgers and spaghetti and more is flat out unreasonable and you causing a scene because of it is entitled, unhinged, and gross. How embarrassing for everyone there to have to witness it and for you to have done it in the first place. \n\nThird, it's not a problem of miscommunication, it's a problem of your unreasonable expectations and rude behavior.\n\nGet some anxiety meds, get through for finals, and look for new friends. These ones rightly don't want anything to do with you. And get some therapy and etiquette training.", "YTA\n\n\"I googled the foods I didn't know and none of that sounded appetizing to me, so I texted Lisa and asked her if she could provide something for me to eat so I didn't starve.

If you're that picky of an eater, then bring your own food. And after she was nice enough to provide you with an option, you criticize her?", "YTA.  This is the price of being a picky eater.  Everyone else had options because everyone else was willing to be flexible.  Lisa could\u2019ve just told you to bring your own food if you weren\u2019t sure you could eat anything else people were planning to bring, but she made sure you\u2019d be fed.  The correct response to that is \u201cthank you.\u201d", "YTA and I can see why you were \u201cbullied\u201d out of your old friend group. You are acting entitled. It\u2019s unrealistic to think a host would provide multiple food options for one person.\n\nEdited to add: I\u2019m putting bullied in quotations because I doubt they actually did bully you. You are describing Lisa as bullying you when she is acting reasonable and you are acting entitled.", "YTA. You're an adult and it's on you to make sure you have something to eat. You gave them options and they got you a pizza. If you're being picky that's on you.", "YTA - If you aren't going to eat what is provided, don't expect ONE friend to provide an entirely alternative meal just because you are picky. \n\nShe already got you a pizza, and IMO if you weren't going to eat, you should have been bringing your OWN food rather than act like an entitled AH who expected to be served something completely different.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, Thanksgiving food doesn\u2019t need to be strictly Turkey and mashed potatoes and stuffing. \n\nSecond, why not bring a dish you can eat, instead of a pie? You brought plenty of audacity to assume the host would provide extra food JUST FOR YOU, which she did. A pizza. Like you said you liked. She\u2019s not obligated to provide more food just because she\u2019s hosting, when the deal was everyone brings something. And you chose to bring a pie instead of food you can eat.", "yta.  you wanted her to provide several dishes for you??  why didn\u2019t you bring something for ur self.  u didn\u2019t even try the food.", "Sorry but YTA, I'd apologize to Lisa and your friends. \n\nYou privately asked Lisa to accommodate your picky eating habits and she did.

Your expectations seem very unrealistic.", ">We were all assigned to bring something, but it didn't have to be Thanksgiving-themed, any food would do (which defeats the purpose of Thanksgiving, but whatever, I'm not the hostess).\n\nThis is were I knew you were going to be TA.\n\nP.s. Not enabling your ridiculously entitled behaviour is not bullying.", "Uhhh yeah, something tells me you weren't \"bullied out of your last friend group\" either. YTA", "YTA - They tried to accommodate your dietary requests (not needs) and you complained about it.  You acted spoiled and entitled. If you're that picky about the food you're eating then bring your own meal.\n\nI'm not surprised they're avoiding you.  You sound exhausting.", "Being picky is not what makes you an AH. Being entitled does.\n\nLisa was kind enough to organize a Pizza for you. And you still expected her to organize a whole variety of food for you. The meaning of sharing food is that no one has the burden to prepare and pay for a whole meal. You put that burden on Lisa by expecting her to give you a variety of food. Why didn't you bring more food that you liked?\n\nYTA.", "YTA are you sure you were bullied out of your original group or that is how you explain them not dealing with your sense of entitlement?", "Info: Why do you have the taste buds of a 10 year old and how do you decide you don't like the flavor of something by googling it?\n\nYTA - the world doesn't revolve around you and you're unnecessary attempts to be difficult.", "YTA, you expected a smorgasbord of dishes for just yourself? Entitled much?", "You are surely kidding? So because you have the diet of a twelve-year-old brat, she has to provide MULTIPLE options for you to choose from over the wonderful buffet of world foods available to you? You have a lot of expectations of Lisa as a host, but zero expectations of how to show up as a guest. Good Lord. Your best options would have been to bring some food yourself seeing as you consider the other options beneath you, or to simply not come. In fact, just don\u2019t go next time and save the other people your entitled shenanigans. \n\nYTA. Big time.", "YTA. You are one person, a picky eater, going to someone *else\u2019s home* and think it\u2019s unfair that there\u2019s not food for you? Lisa isn\u2019t your chef, she is taking time to host a gathering. Bring your own food if you have difficulties with new or foreign foods. \n\nBtw, one person\u2019s foreign or \u201cweird\u201d food is someone else\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201chome\u201d food. My Middle Eastern mom thinks American style hummus is dry and bland \u2014 even shameful to serve others, but I\u2019m sure that hasn\u2019t stopped folks from thinking it tastes great and bringing it to parties. And people do, and there\u2019s nothing wrong about it.\n\nEdit: the fact you were also looking to see if someone sided with you over Lisa, like\u2026 the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "YTA: Lisa went out of her way to provide an extra option just so you would have something to eat. It was bold of you to ask her to have a separate option for you, much less several options. If you're going to be that picky on foods it's on you to bring food you like.\n\n~~The only part of Lisa's actions that weren't a-okay were keeping the leftover pie even though I'd call that a gray area since she was hosting.~~", "YTA\n\nIf I had a nickel for every time the AH said \"It's just who I am\"...\n\nBroaden your horizons! Don't want to try anything new and instead live your life in stagnation? Fantastic, don't make it other people's problem and shut your mouth and eat some pie.", "Clearly, YTA. You sent her a list of options because you were too picky to do what everyone else was doing, and you expected her to buy you multiple of the options? That\u2019s ridiculous. No one would ever think that was what you meant or what she was expected to do. She did you a favor by purchasing an additional dish that only you would eat, and complied with the option list.\n\nYou\u2019re not being bullied because of your tastes. You\u2019re being ignored because you acted unreasonably and maybe they don\u2019t want to hang out with you. If you want to repair this friendship, you should contact Lisa and apologize immediately.", "YTA\n\nYour host graciously provided you with something you would eat so that you would be fed.  That was going above and beyond as a hostess, since for a large meal like this, all she would have been required to do was allow *you* to bring your own meal.  Especially when there are no medical issues involved and just a dislike of \"foreign\" food (lmao like pizza isn't), she wasn't required to provide you with anything at all.  \n\nActing like you were entitled to be provided with a main and sides specifically for your tastes is *beyond* spoiled and self-centered.  If you wanted additional options you could eat, you should have brought them yourself with enough to share.", "YTA I guess we know why you were \u201cbullied\u201d out of your old group.  There was a big list and yet you expected someone else to provide a \u201cvariety\u201d for you? And you just brought an apple pie? Why didn\u2019t you bring a couple of things then?  If you want to eat bland food then BYO. \n\nDon\u2019t expect everyone to cater for your extremely narrow needs - start trying to broaden your horizons or expect to be spending a lot of time alone. \n\nI don\u2019t think it matters now - but think about it for the next \u201cfriends\u201d group as I doubt you are in this one any more.", "LMFAO you saying you got bullied out of your other friend group seems a little sus after reading this post. You sound like a difficult friend to have. Of course YTA. If you wanted food to eat \u201cso you didn\u2019t starve\u201d (dramatic but ok) , you should have brought something for yourself. Your friend was hosting a potluck. Which means she was hosting as far as *where* the event was held, and she was not responsible for providing food beyond what she had planned. She went above and beyond with the pizza you requested *for just you* , then you acted like a brat. Smh. Idk about them, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t put up with anyone who acted like that.", "YTA.\n\nYou know you can\u2019t eat much and yet make that everyone else\u2019s responsibility. They made sure you\u2019d have something to eat. How much are they supposed to give up to cater to your limited palate? \n\nYou might have the tastebuds of a child but that\u2019s no excuse to act like one.\n\nYou\u2019re not being bullied for your taste, they\u2019ve realized that you are incredibly entitled and selfish friend and nobody wants to be around that.", "You're the one who's the picky eater, not any of your friends.  It's on you to bring something that you'll eat.  You also don't bring something and take it back.  YTA.", "YTA.  Are you 5 years old?  I don't know any group that could accommodate your level of pickiness.  You were lucky that she gave you even one thing to eat.", "YTA. It was great of the host to provide an option for you. Beyond that, it's on you.", "YTA. And you are really acting entitled and like a spoiled brat. She already thought of you and got you pizza (sinsce you're so ignorant on different cultures and only eat junk as far as I understood based on the list you mentioned). Did you really expect her to make you a full restoran menu of different dishes? Wow, just wow. I guess I understand why you lost your previous friend group. You sound totally entitled and exhausting.", "Yea YTA. She went out of her way to accommodate you not wanting to eat anything there. I'd have told you to bring your own food entirely.", "YTA and you are spoiled. You can\u2019t say you don\u2019t like something you\u2019ve never tried. They may sound like you won\u2019t like them but how would you know?  You had food to eat. If you are that picky, bring your own. You are not being bullied. You just aren\u2019t being catered to.

It's my job to work around that, not everyone else's. That means either bringing my own food, planning to eat before, whatever. \n\nShe already went way above by getting you your very own pizza.

You do not have food allergies or food sensitivities.\n\nAs a 'picky eater\" it was actually on you, not the hostess, to bring food to eat. You wanted a variety?

I'm not surprised your old friend group dropped you if this is how you behave in company. I think you should expect the same from this group. \n\nIf it were me (and it often is; I'm not \"picky\" but I am vegetarian), I would have brought a main that I could eat and be happy with, even if I could eat nothing else. And of course I would have brought enough of it to feed eight or more, not just myself. \n\nThen I would probably also bring the dessert I had signed up for, but if I really didn't have time I would have just asked the host whether I could switch from dessert to main (what's she gonna say, \"no\"?).\n\nYTA. Although if I were Lisa I would have let you take your pie home (although I would have been shocked that you were rude enough to ask for it). So maybe a slight E S H there.", "YTA I am also a picky eater. Either bring something substantial for yourself, eat the pizza the hostess got for literally only you, or starve.

People like trying new foods, Friendsgiving is not thanksgiving so they can bring whatever they want. \n2. Why would your require someone else to buy you food that you want and no one else does? \n3.

Second of all you quite literally were accommodated. You are asking your host to make you individual portions of all your favourite foods? That\u2019s absolute bullshit and you know it.

Why didn't you just bake some chicken and throw it in some Tupperware with rice and veggies?\n\nYou acknowledge that this is how you are. Well then potlucks aren't for you. Never expect the world to conform to your severely limited palate. You have to bring your own bland ass food to parties. You weren't being a good friend here.

He's a fussy eater!' \"Fussy eater\" is a euphemism for \"Big pain in the ass", "YTA. What are you like 12? Hummus and BBQ pork are not like something crazy and super ethnic. Surely there were more than 2 dishes. Then when you get there you once again act like a child because you were not catered to.  Instead of pie you should have brought spaghetti or burgers since you knew main courses would be a problem for you.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't have a variety of things to eat because you are an extremely picky eater that is not interested in trying anything, what would have been unfair is to expect Lisa to bring out a buffet just for you when there was already so much food.\n\nYou were in the wrong and owe Lisa an apology.", "It's incredibly weird that knowing what everyone was going to bring, and knowing you wouldn't like most of it,  you decided to bring a singular pie?\n\n**I am also incredibly picky**,  and if I were in a situation where I'm invited to a potluck and I  knew I'd only eat two dishes out of everything,  I probably would have made 1 or 2 dishes I knew I personally liked and would eat to the potluck. Then I would have plenty to eat and not feel like a sore thumb. \n\nBut instead of doing the logical thing that many adults with dietary restrictions, diets, and foods preferences do, (ie.

Even if you had to deal with ppl telling you that you were an ah for not bringing enough to share. It would be far better to deal with that then to put your wants (for no other reason than \"its the way you are\") on others. It's the way you are, not anyone else. Either try new things, deal with what you can eat, or make sure you take care of you.\n\nBTW. It wouldn't matter if this was new friends, old friends, or family, it would all result in the same, you are responsible for you.\n\n\nEdit to add: I am saying this without any malice or to be mean or anything of the sort. You should try to open yourself to trying new foods. Things that you don't know may notnsound the best when you read recipes or what they are online, but be a totally different experience when you try then. Trying them doesn't mean you have to put a bunch on your plate. You can put a tiny little bit, just enough to get a taste. If you don't like it, you don't like it and nothing (or nothing much) went to waste. When I met my husband he had a very similar response to food. He liked what he liked and didn't want to try new things. Income from a family where we eat many different types of food and try new things all the time. After over a decade of being together his pallete has changed. I never tried to pressure him (to much, I will admit I did a little but that was only bc he was my bf/fiance/husband, I wouldn't have pushed the same ifnit had been a friend or anyone else) to try things he wasn't used to. He has new favorite foods, and these are things he never thought he would eat in the first place. While he may not be as excited as I get over trying new things, he does do it and has thanked me for opening him up to things he wasn't used to or never thought he'd like before. I realized with him that he felt like there was some expectation that he HAD to like whatever he tried. And that's not true (and never let anyone bully you about it needing to be like that). But you never know what you may or may not like if you don't try something. While you need to do what your comfortable with, getting out of your comfort zone just to see (could be food, clothes, experience or anything) may open yourself up to a part of you that you never knew existed or could exist.", "I'm a picky eater too who has the same pasta every holiday while everyone else enjoy different foods and you're just rude.

You could have brought your own plate to enjoy and spend time with everyone.\nYou started a fight over something meant to be a nice bonding experience.\n\nYou were acting spoiled and if can't conduct yourself at a potluck politely maybe those events aren't meant for you.\n\n>\tThat was a couple weeks ago, and everyone is ignoring me\n\nI would expect that to continue.\n\n \n\n>\tI feel like I\u2019m being bullied for my tastes. \n\nNo you\u2019re being held accountable for alienating your new group of friends who were excited to share their cultures with you and have a nice time.  \nInstead you made Friendsgiving about you and your picky eating.\n\nEverything isn\u2019t about you. You aren\u2019t being reasonable. Hopefully your next group of friends, if there is one, gets a better version of you than this.", "YTA\n\nWas this, or something similar, the reason you were \"bullied\" out of your last friend group? Who are you to say what is it isn't Thanksgiving food? So you wanted the typical white family turkey/stuffing/cranberry sauce, etc and were throwing a fit because no one (YOU INCLUDED) didn't bring it? \n\nYou're entitled and rude. Good on the other friends for sticking up for Lisa.", "YTA\n\nYou literally asked for a pizza and got pizza\n\nLook...you are a picky eater.  You are never going to get to enjoy a pot luck or buffet style meal unless you are the one who prepares all the food.\n\nSo unless you are willing to try new things...then you need to make peace with that fact.  It sucks.  But again, you like what you like.\n\nI myself detest seafood.  Basically anything that comes from the water makes my stomach turn.  I've never been able to go to the beach and enjoy fresh seafood.  I don't get to enjoy crawfish boils.  Never gotten to enjoy lobster.    And sushi makes me want to hurl.  \n\nMy brain is hardwired differently and because of that, I don't get to enjoy seafood like everyone else.  If I go on vacation to the beach, I end up having to eat chicken fingers at seafood restaurants because of how my tastebuds work.  But I made peace with it.\n\nThe truth is, you are probably always going to be feel left out when it comes to large gatherings that revolve around food.  \n\nThat's just reality...and instead of nuking your friendships because people refuse to accommodate your limited food options, you just need to accept who you are, what you like, and plan accordingly.\n\nIn this instance, you could have eaten before you got there and just enjoyed everyone's company.  Having the pizza would have been a nice bonus treat...something you could have appreciated.\n\nInstead, you threw a temper tantrum and possibly got yourself booted from the friendgroup.\n\nI know this is not what you wanted to hear, but it's what you need to hear.\n\nIt's time to either figure out a way to try new things....or it's time to accept that this is how your life will be moving forward.", "YTA---GROW UP!", "Wow. You are a serious AH.\n\nI hosted thanksgiving this year, I made everything. \n\nAt the last minute a vegan RSVP'd, and I did my best to accomodate him- made everything apart from the turkey as vegan friendly as possible, but the dude STILL brought his own food.\n\nYour case is even worse- it was a POTLUCK situation and you still wanted someone else to make extra food for you?\n\n So you brought pie but couldn't be bothered to bring anything else you might like?\n\nOn top of that you threw a tantrum (aka \"got into an argument\" about it) instead of just trying to enjoy your time with your friends (your new friends, at that).\n\nYikes.\nYTA", "YTA", "YTA on steroids!\n\nI thought from the title that someone got offended that you didn't like the food they brought.\n\nYou were worried about \"starving\" when you (rudely) asked the hostess to supply alternatives, not worried about the lack of variety.\n\nYou're not being bullied because of your limited palate, you're just offended that you aren't being catered to.\n\nBe. Responsible. For. Your. Own. Food. if you're going to be that picky.", "YTA. I already thought you were an ah for being so judgemental about \"ethnic food\" but then your friend was nice enough to get you a pizza and you had the nerve to complain it wasn't enough???? Why the f did you not ask to swap with someone so they could bring dessert and you could being a bland potato dish? Or why did you not offer to bring some food in addition to the apple pie? If you behaved like this with your previous friends I fully get why you've been kicked out of their group", "YTA and I'm guessing this is why your other friends group was over it.  You could have brought food for yourself instead of expecting her to provide you with multiple options.  She went out of her way to get you one of the things you'd wanted.  And you already said you'd eat bread and pie,  so technically you have options.  And then to throw a toddler like tantrum at their house when they are hosting you.  Yikes.  I'd steer clear of you after this also.  She was already making her traditional dishes and you expected her to catef to your picky eating.  You could have tried any of the dishes brought but your preconceived attitude of I won't like it kept your from expanding your childlike palet. Ffs you should apologize but I'm guessing it's too late.  They all just saw how entitled you are.\n\nEdit to add.... and you tried to take back the pie.  I can't even with this.", "Info: What food did you bring for Friendsgiving?", "YTA, she was extremely generous to even get the pizza. You should have either gone and brought something you would eat, eaten before and just socialized or not gone at all. You can\u2019t make your issues other people\u2019s problems.", "YTA\n\nBut not because you're picky about food, but because you behaved badly. The idea is that everyone brings a dish, if you don't like anything that will be there, then you bring your own food.\n\nYou gave Lisa a few options and she chose one that you liked and that she could give you, even if the deal was for each person to bring a dish. There's nothing wrong there.", "YTA, you're a self proclaimed picky eater and aren't willing to try new things not that you have allergies, in that case it was up to you to accommodate yourself. She got you a pizza which was quite kind considering she was already making other items. You didnt even try any of the other items, just got upset you were provided with a pizza. I'm curious to know if you were bullied out of your other friend group becasue you were being difficult with them too.", "YTA and an entitled one at that. I bet you had shocked Pikachu face that you once again \u201cgot bullied\u201d.\n\nExcept, no one bullied you - you were the entitled bully in this scenario. Picky eaters should not demand extras from the host, especially since she did already go out of her way to accommodate you with a pizza. It was up to you to bring something that wasn\u2019t on the list if you wanted more\u2026 or you could have maybe *tried* the unfamiliar foods. \n\nI\u2019m curious how your family of origin dealt with your pickiness. It sounds like they capitulated to whatever you wanted because of your inflexibility to ever try something different. \n\nI understand sticking with what you know.. but you are severely limiting yourself and creating drama for no good reason.", "YTA.

YTA either way", "YTA\n\nI was a horrifically picky eater until I was about 23, so I know what it's like to see everyone wolfing down food that I couldn't stand. I still have a hearty dislike of salmon, for example, and I was very grateful that I was given scrambled eggs the last time I was at a dinner where salmon was the main course.\n\n**You were accommodated** \\- you got your special pizza. The hostess had no other obligation to cater to your limited palate after providing you with \"just\" a pizza. **Frankly, it was kind of her to have given you a special pizza**. *Especially as* ***her role as hostess was to provide the physical space NOT the food****. I mean, that's the whole point of a potluck!*\n\n**You also could have brought your own dish**.\n\nAgain, I'm a recovering picky eater, but ***I'd suggest trying a tiny little bite of everything***. You might be pleasantly surprised and actually like stuff that you haven't considered eating before. That's how I learned that I actually **can** eat other fish dishes, as I'd refused to eat them before. \n\n(My diet as a kid was pretty much potatoes, the smallest amounts possible of carrots and peas, meat, spaghetti bolognese, yogurt, no cheese, no fish or other seafood, no salad, hardly any fruit, bread - it was very limited!)", "Resounding YTA.

They didn't like you because YTA", "YTA, I'm a vegan and I'm pretty happy if someone provides ***one*** thing for me to eat. To expect a variety makes YTA. Being a picky eater is valid, but expecting othes to cater to your wishes makes you a prick.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nThere was a VARIETY of food available to you, you just chose to not eat any of it. \n\nHonestly, Lisa was more than gracious enough to offer you pizza. She was under no obligation to do so, she was already hosting the event and everyone was providing food.\n\nIf you know you\u2019re picky, bring your own food. Bring more than enough! Bring a pie and pizza and burgers for everyone, if you want to have variety. \n\nThey\u2019re not bullying you, you\u2019re acting like an entitled spoiled brat who\u2019s used to everyone catering to your needs, and life is hitting you hard.", "YTA, I'm a picky eater, I don't expect other people to cater for that.

It is 100% YOUR responsibility to make sure you have something to eat. \n\nLisa did more than she had to by even getting you a pizza at all. \n\nYou should have asked about bringing something else that you could share with the others and that you would also eat. \n\nThis is 100% on you.", "YTA.  You should have brought your own meal.  Which, I bet.. would have been one option,  not several.  \n\nIt\u2019s not the hostess\u2019 problem you are a picky eater.", "YTA, she went well out of her way by providing you a pizza and you had the audacity to ask for MORE?!", "YTA\n\nI really thought this was going to be a post about people offended that you brought your own food and didn\u2019t even try what they made.  Lisa was incredibly kind and generous to get you anything separate and your expectation of a customized smorgasbord just for you is ridiculous.", "You were \"bullied\" from your last friend group and now you are being \"bullied for your tastes\". No OP, you are the problem. \n\n**YTA.** You feel like there was a miscommunication? No there was not at all on the host's part. There are several dishes being provided and you are so limited in your palate that you aren't even willing to taste, so yeah you get pizza. OR you could've brought a frigging main dish instead of pie since YOU are the one refusing to try anyone's food. You ARE acting like a Spoiled, entitled brat. Who does this??????", "YTA. I have a feeling you weren\u2019t \u201cbullied\u201d out of the friend group. They probably kicked you out for good reason.", "Yes, YTA.  Expecting the host to cater to your demands is not cool.  OP should have taken a dish apart from the apple pie that she would enjoy.  But to not even TRY any of the other offerings?  How very limiting to oneself....", "YTA. You need some help with social interactions, or else this will keep happening with every group you meet. It was kind of your hostess to get you a special meal. To expect her to provide several options just for you is unreasonable. What if every guest wanted several dishes made for them? You are way too young to be so set in your ways: if you are this rigid now, what will you be like when you are old? For your own sake, change this pattern now.", "If you saw the dishes initially and didn\u2019t want any of them, you should have prepared a meal for yourself to bring.. you knew well in advance you weren\u2019t going to be eating what others brought.", "YTA. Wow. The entitlement is strong here! You were bringing a pie, why not also bring something you could eat? No one limited you to bringing just a pie, you made that choice. Why are you trying to make your food issues other people's responsibility? You knew well ahead of time there was nothing you would like, you had plenty of time to figure out that you needed to bring something for yourself to eat. There were many options, you just didn't like any of them, that's a YOU problem, so it's yours to solve.", "YTA. You knew beforehand that you wouldn't want anything and should have brought a plate of something for yourself.

I would have 100% told you to bring something to eat that you did find acceptable.", "Yeah, YTA. Bring your own food if you're unwilling to try stuff that other people bring.", "YTA. I think it was really nice of Lisa to provide pizza for you when you were the one with the problem. \nYou should've taken some dishes that you liked instead of just pie. Being picky is okay but don't expect people to cater for you. That is what makes you spoiled.", "YTA. You were rude. Why should she provide loads of food for you?", "YTA. You\u2019re a picky eater. You can either bring your own food, eat before, or not eat. The fact that your friend got you a pizza was REALLY nice and accommodating. The fact that you had the audacity and entitlement to ask her to make you more than one thing, or even the 1 thing, is a lot. This whole thing is ridiculous.

Congrats on getting yourself removed from another friend group! If you want multiple options because you're too picky for your own good, and stubborn about it at that, there's this amazing thing called *bringing your own fucking food.*\n\nI'm picky, always have been. I bring my own shit if I'm invited to a gathering where the majority of options are things I don't like. It's not the hosts job to cater to the pickiest, most entitled, person at an event.\n\nI'm doubting you were bullied out of your last friend group so much as they got annoyed, expressed how intolerable you were in social settings, and you took it exactly as well as someone who is as entitled as you is expected to take it.", "There was no miscommunication. By asking for additional food you made it clear YTA. LIsa just tried to accommodate you anyways. Also keep in mind that you ARE ABLE to eat the foods, you choose not to. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone more entitled.", "YTA.... \"Picky eaters\" who won't eat anything are rude. Stay home next time or bring something you know you'll like... You have agency: You didn't have to bring only pie. You could have brought something you knew you liked, you chose to bring pie. Your friend made a pizza for you, the only thing in the world you indicated you liked, and you're still mad? Good grief. This has to be fake, right?", "YTA. You asked for something to be provided that you eat, she gave you a pizza. You're entitled. Why weren't you able to make something you eat? You're 26, grow up & try new foods.", "You could just be thankful that she got you pizza! YTA", "I don\u2019t get it. You basically judged the fact that there was no \u201cThanksgiving themed food\u201d, and when asked what you wanted to eat you listed fast food whcih definitely isn\u2019t anywhere near thanksgiving themed food either. \n\nI Honeslty think you\u2019re very upset about the fact thag you\u2019re a picky eater and you\u2019re not differentiating that from your friends and took it out on them. Instead of working through your feelings of being disappointed you weren\u2019t able to share a meal. \n\nYou should apologize to your friends and maybe talk to soemone about how to be able to identify your feelings in a healthy manner. YTA because your friend probably assumed you wouldn\u2019t be able to eat more then one pizza. You could\u2019ve brought some food for yourself or communicated it differently.

I'm picky also.  VERY picky.   But I don't expect to be catered to.", "YTA, why didn\u2019t you just bring a dish that you would enjoy?

The audacity, I would never invite you to my house again.", "YTA\nBeing a picky eater is a YOU problem, and not everyone's else's!\n\nYou should have brought something else to eat besides the pie since you are the only one, who knows exactly what you like or dislike. \n\nThe hostess provided an alternate for you, if you want more than that, it's up to yourself to bring it.", "YTA.

BUT if I DO like it, I just added another thing to my personal menu and it's good all the way around.\n\nYTA so hard dude. You weren't forced to starve. You could have brought something else besides pie, or you could have sucked it up and tried some of the food your friends made. You sound like a brat.", "So, why didn't you bring anything you knew you liked, besides pie? It was a potluck and people brought what they were comfortable with.\n\nYou were being sort of a spoiled brat, thinking people should cater to your very specific taste. Then to demand more, was highly rude.\n\nYou say you feel like they're bullying you for your taste when it feels like you tried to bully your friends to cater to you.

Throwaway account.\n\nI (26F) joined a group of friends I met in grad school. We range anywhere from 23 - 30, and we're a mix of men and women. I was bullied out of my old friend group so I started hanging out with the current group since February. They have all been friends longer than I have, so I'm like the new addition.\n\nFor the last couple years, they do Friendsgiving, which is usually a week or 2 before Thanksgiving, and we all bring a dish/drink to someone's house. This year a girl, \"Lisa\", said she would host since her and her fiance just moved into a big condo. We were all assigned to bring something, but it didn't have to be Thanksgiving-themed, any food would do (which defeats the purpose of Thanksgiving, but whatever, I'm not the hostess).\n\nNow I've always been a picky eater. I don't have allergies or anything, but I know what I like and I'm not interested in trying new foods. That may offend some people but that's just who I am. We had a Google Doc for who was bringing what, and I quickly realized I wouldn't be able to eat anything except bread rolls and apple pie (and I was bringing the pie!). There was a lot of foreign food, since most of the friend group comes from diverse backgrounds, some examples are Lisa is Chinese so she was going to make Chinese BBQ pork and steam a whole fish, another person's family is Lebanese so they were going to bring hummus, parsley salad, etc.\n\nI googled the foods I didn't know and none of that sounded appetizing to me, so I texted Lisa and asked her if she could provide something for me to eat so I didn't starve. She asked me what I was thinking, so I provided her with some options, such as pizza, burgers, spaghetti with meat sauce, etc. She said she would.\n\nSo I go to Friendsgiving and everyone starts to help themselves, and Lisa brings me out a pizza. I asked her where my other options were, and she says there are no other options, I said I liked pizza, so she got me a pizza. I felt this was unfair because everyone had a variety to choose from and I was essentially being forced to eat 1 thing.\n\nWe got into an argument. I told her when I gave her a list of options, I expected her to have a few different ones for me, like a good hostess would do. She said no, why should she provide a bunch of food (I never said a bunch) for just 1 person. No one stood up for me and a couple people even sided with Lisa, saying I was acting spoiled. I ended up in tears and left early without eating anything. Lisa wouldn't even give me back the pie I brought, which was unnecessarily mean.\n\nThat was a couple weeks ago, and everyone is ignoring me (granted, it's nearing the end of the semester so we've all been busy). I'm starting to feel that there was a miscommunication between Lisa and I, but I wanted to see if anyone would side with me. My friends are aware I only like a few foods, and I feel like I'm being bullied for my tastes. I'm super anxious and upset and can't focus on my finals, so Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm not vegetarian but a large percentage of my people are. I've long hosted a \"hobos and orphans\" Thanksgiving. Everyone and anyone is welcome to stop in but the whole point is for singletons, divorcees, and folks without local family to have a fun place to indulge their most gluttonous inclinations. \n\nMost people bring dishes, but they don't have to. I prepare a turkey, dressing, gravy, and cranberry sauce (never canned, yuck.) I make two kinds of mashed potatoes, vegan and vegetarian w/ butter and milk. I always make a large pot of vegan friendly fare like curry lentils or chickpea Tikka masala and rice. \n\nMy guests bring food as well. With family and work obligations people tend to show up in waves and eat all afternoon and evening. This year, as an example, guests also brought a ham, a smoked turkey, tofurkey, and a veggie lasagna. Obviously there were a ton of desserts, side dishes, salads, and appetizers too. \n\nIt's okay to have a restrictive diet, but you've got to take ownership on how you address that issue.", "I like apple pie and I would have eaten it.

I wouldn't have touched hummus as a teen or young adult but now I eat it all the time. My younger sister used to be even pickier than I am and now she is an adult and the most adventurous eater I know. I know food aversions exist, but it wouldn't hurt you to try some things that you hadn't before. You don't have to eat things you already know you don't like but if you've never had the bbq pork (or whatever), what's the harm if you try it alongside a roll and some pie?", "Where do I begin? So many things wrong here.\n\n\"Not everyone is privileged to have a varied food education growing up.\"\n\nWell, you were given the privilege of varied foods at Thanksgiving and instead were a pain the the ass and turned your nose at dishes that mean something to your friends.  If you wanted other foods, bring them yourself.  To ask the hostess to provide additional food is so entitled. She was gracious enough to provide you pizza and instead of thanking her you comment there was only one!  And then you want to take your pie with you after throwing a fit.   Good lord, you're a piece of work. \n\nTotal AH.  Grow up.", "Hi, formerly picky eater here. I too grew up in a very white town in a family with a limited budget. I kept up my picky eating until I was a teenager and turns out, I didn\u2019t have the palate of a child anymore, and things I\u2019d previously tried and didn\u2019t like tasted good, and things I\u2019d never tried before tasted good as well! And some things I still didn\u2019t like or didn\u2019t enjoy upon tasting it for the first time. If you never try anything new, you\u2019ll never know what you might like. You are limiting yourself as a human being by sticking to the palate of a child. Unless you have something like undiagnosed ADHD or autism, there is absolutely no reason why you should not try new things, barring allergies of course, which you say you don\u2019t have. \n\nI know it\u2019s scary and intimidating at first. But the good news is, if you try something one time, and you don\u2019t like it, then you never have to eat it again.

Maybe try to expand your palate in ways that feel safe to you.  If you like noodles, try some Chinese noodle dishes.  Or pad thai, which is a very accessible Thai noodle dish.

Growing up we more or less ate the same things over and over never going out of a very small comfort zone.  I CHOOSE to not be that way.  You are nothing more than an entitled spoiled brat who needs to grow up!  Why in the world do you think you should expect/insist that \"the host\" should get you multiple entrees when it's a freaking pot luck dinner!?  It's very obvious why you lost your last friend group, and from the sounds of it, your new one too! \n\nBy the way, you are way huge YTA !!!!", "Look, I get it. Grew up similarly although it was because my mom had a lot of food-related trauma and that along with poverty basically pushed us to eat the same 5 flavors of Hamburger Helper and mashed potato flakes and barely seasoned pork chops for practically every meal, and trying new foods was often met with disdain. However, after I moved out and in with my now husband, I was thrown into a world of new foods. It scared me, and even now there's still plenty I won't eat (namely fish due to an aversion), but I don't regret taking the steps I dud because now I actually enjoy food instead of just seeing it as a means to stay alive. I won't say to just throw yourself out there, but you should try and be more open minded and give new things a shot. It doesn't need to be big. Just a different form of things you enjoy, like pizza or spaghetti, can be enough.\n\nUltimately, if you don't want to try new things, that's your choice. However, you shouldn't expect your friends to then cater exclusively to your aversions and force themselves to either limit what they enjoy or make more that you would only really benefit from. If you knew from the list that you wouldn't eat anything there, you could've offered to bring your own food. Yes, Lisa is the host, but it sounds like the meal was a potluck. You didn't just have to stick with bringing pie or relying on her to provide multiple options for you to eat. The initiative should've also been on you. But you assumed otherwise and when called out on your assumptions, you doubled down and put all of the blame on her instead of on yourself as well.\n\nHopefully after finals are done, you all can sit down and talk again. But the talk needs to start with an apology from you. You did act out of place here by insulting Lisa. While she didn't provide a variety, she still catered to your needs with the pizza, and that is still being a good host. And in the future, if you aren't willing to open your world to different foods, you need to promise that you'll bring in more foods that you will eat so the onus isn't only on your friends to cater to your choices. Because your aversions, in this case, are personal choices that you are making and not something like allergies that could be life threatening and need to be catered to. And with any luck, your friends will accept your apology and move on. Good luck to you.", "\"Not everyone is privileged to have a varied food education growing up.\"\n\nWell... now you're an adult.  Learn how to open yourself to trying new things.  You might find something really amazing.  You'll probably have to work through things you don't like, but you need to try.

I have traveled to different continents with \u201cpicky eaters.\u201d \n\nTo note: Now, I know that yes there are food aversions. I know there are people, some of my relatives included, that have sensitivity and intolerances. And it may take time to figure all that out. But there are people who just look at a food and go mentally \u201cew.\u201d And it\u2019s this view of non-American food.\n\nI have traveled with such a person that we literally scoured two whole countries\u2019 worth of meals and she would not eat anything, and clutched to an imported box of corn flakes. FFS. Rice is everywhere. Bread in most places. Vegetables grow in some shape or form. Eating is part of the journey. Don\u2019t leave your home and ruin it for everyone.", "We had some \"Western\" (to go off of your phrasing) friends, but they brought stuff I didn't like either (such as stuffed mushrooms). It has nothing to do with diferent races, I just don't like certain foods.", "Fair point, I read it more as pie leftovers after everyone had eaten already. If it was pre-meal I would 100% agree with you.", "Completely agree, I read it as a leftover slice or 2 after everybody had pie. In that case I think if the bringer wants to take it back home that would be okay.", "I wonder if OP even got \u201cbullied\u201d out or was the old group just tired of OP\u2019s entitlement.", "Anyone this picky always brings there own food, kinda unfair you expected your friends to make you a special platter. I think you should message and apologize to her before you dig yourself a deeper hole....", "You\u2019re avoiding the main question everyone is trying to ask you\u2026 why on earth would you feel so entitled that you need multiple different types of \u201cyour\u201d food. That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. She did accommodate you. You\u2019re definitely TA", "I'm sorry, so you wanted an array of pizza, burgers, and spaghetti?", "Yeah, nothing POC *or* healthy!", "You singled out as your examples Chinese and Lebanese food...\n\nOP are you on the spectrum/do you have ARFID? It's not an excuse, but it would go a long way to explaining. I also might balk at a whole steamed fish, but you can't even eat hummus?! It's so texturally inoffensive, and delicious! (I am a texture person, so I can sympathize on that end, but not with such rigidity and rudeness)\n\nRegardless: picky eaters, those with conditions like ARFID, and those with allergies/dietary restrictions are responsible for their own pickiness/issues/conditions. That's the rule. It is not up to your host to provide a separate pot luck for you. I say that as a \"picky eater\" though maybe I'm not because I'd eat half the things you've name-checked, at least. But I also know in these situations always to bring a main dish or side I know I will happily eat. Or that plus a dessert, if I want to bake. \n\nTake this as a learning lesson coming a bit late; you're 26, and if you want to sustain social relationships long term you need to check your entitlement and make your picky eating solely your problem, not others. You'll just keep burning through friend groups unless you learn this.

Get over yourself.", "Reading her replies I'm kind of surprised she didn't request a turkey.", "I was super freaked out by the raw fish aspect of sushi before I\u2019d tried it so I stuck to California rolls at first, now I eat sashimi and literally almost any sushi lol. Turns out that when you try new things you might actually like them! Crazy how that works. OP\u2019s stance is so odd.", "The pork didn't smell or look appealing. The fish was literally a whole fish, with the bones and tail and eyeball on display right there on the table. It didn't look appetizing.", "I doubt that she grew up with hummus or Chinese BBQ. It\u2019s not something people just bring in most American households to Thanksgiving. There are people that won\u2019t eat something unless they grew up with it, not for any real reason other than the fact that they don\u2019t know how to evolve as adults past this. \n\nAnd she mentioned in the OP she googled most of the items\u2026 and determined she wouldn\u2019t like them from that. Knowing this, still showing up expecting someone to prepare her other options.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with not liking certain foods. \n\nI\u2019m also a picky eater. Some tastes, some textures I just won\u2019t eat. When I go to potlucks I bring 1-2 things I know I like, and sometimes end up eating most that, and maybe only eat 1 or 2 other things if they look good to me. I would never demand the host provide a spread just for me.", "Have you tried these foods 2-3 times to determine you don\u2019t like them? I find it hard to believe unless you have some underlying condition, the fact that you cannot find one food made by any of these people to be something you can eat\u2026\n\nIn your post you said \u201cthey didn\u2019t sound appetizing to me\u201d when you googled them. So yes, you are basically *expecting* people to make you *conventional* American food. And avoiding the non-Western dishes based on what you googled. Why don\u2019t you be the bigger person and cook what you would like to see, as if there were 5 friendsfivingdrama\u2019s in attendance?", "So it would have been a regular thing to do to bring things you DO like. Perhaps some \u201ctraditional Thanksgiving food\u201d?", "Fair enough - I read it as the argument happened at the start of the meal so I just assumed the full pie!", "Too late for that, I'm pretty sure she's dug her way to the ocean by now.", "Honestly I too got major spectrum vibes from this post.

No one is bullying you, you are rude, entitled, and spoiled.", "Okay, I'm legitimately curious, why did you not bring something of your own that was more substantial than apple pie?

The audacity of you having to survive with your own choices!", "YTA.\n\nShe did consider your needs by having Pizza available for you. It was your choice to only eat that pizza. You could have brought your own foods in the first place. \nWhy would she have payed for 3-4 meals for just one person when everyone would be sharing the other meals provided? Were you even going to finish the pizza? Also, you had both pizza and pie, how hungry would you have really been?\n\nAnd I highly suspect you were not \u201cbullied \u201c out of your other friend group.", "I\u2019m starting to see why you got kicked out of you last friend group.", "She did consider your needs (wants)! She asked you what you wanted and got you that thing!  YOU acted like a child and threw a tantrum bc she didn\u2019t treat you like a king.", "The world does not revolve around what you do or don't like. Its pretty inconsiderate of you to think people should have to make special accommodations specifially because you won't, not  can't but won't, eat anything that anyone else brought. Its not the hosts job to have a 3 course meal set aside for you because you dont like anything that anyone else brought. She graciously got you something that you did like, which along with the rolls and the pie you brought does technically  mean you had a few things to eat. If you don't like feeling left out I suggest you expand your pallet. If not, then deal with the consequences  of your own pickiness like adult instead of expecting others to make special considerations solely for your sake. The world/ your friends don't owe you some special consideration because your taste buds never evolved past the 3rd grade. While every person on this planet is UNIQUE, you arent \"SPECIAL\" and therefore do not deserve \"SPECIAL\" treatment.

One of the things that's part of a potluck is that the costs of food and effort are shared a little more equally.

He feeds himself and then enjoys the things he knows he likes at the event (dinner rolls, sometimes dessert, etc).

It was a potluck.", "Why would you need a variety of food?? She was being generous by giving you pizza", "Why in the world do you need pizza and burgers or pizza and spaghetti??
