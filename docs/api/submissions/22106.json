You don't get to tell people what present they're supposed to give, especially if it's (as I gather; you didn't actually say so directly) pricey.\n\nToo many people make such a big deal out of birthday parties, anyway. It's fine for the kids, because they get to run around and shout for joy. Plus cake.\n\nBut wouldn't the adults rather just relax at home? I think you're better off not going--especially with this crummy stepsister. Next time she asks for a babysit help, tell her no.", "NTA and you just saved a gift!", "She is rude beyond words.

Others give the wishlist but she cray lol", "NTA Never buy that rude kid or his mother a present ever again in your life. Do this FOR YOURSELF . THE ENTITLEMENT!!!!", "NTA - She is way too entitled. As a parent you can give suggestions if asked, but you do not dictate what someone buys for your kid. Take the toy back and get your money back. You did nothing wrong. Your sister is an asshole.", "NTA.  Your sis is an entitled AH.  She uninvited you bc you wouldn't get him a specific, costly present.  What is it with people requesting expensive gifts from others?  It's an unreasonable request for a lot of people.", "NTA. Your step sister's want of control does not extend to your wallet. That's not how it works. She can make all the lists her little heart desires, doesn't mean you have to follow them. The present you decide to gift them, is of your choosing, not hers. The fact that she's already asked her guests to buy him a present, puts in the pale in my book. \n\nSince you've been uninvited from the party, take the money out of the card and treat you and your partner to a little something special (if baby is old enough, definitely treat them too). Maybe some ice cream or something neat from a local bakery. Or put it in baby's piggy bank.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t even give the card and money if you\u2019ve been uninvited. What a pathetic child your SIL is.", "NTA.  Wow.  Your stepsister is out of control.", "Dunno how much more that toy is, but still NTA.\n\nSee the good side of it, now you are 20 pounds ahead since you don't need to send a gift to a party you were not invited to.", "NTA"]}
