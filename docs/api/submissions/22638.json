Obviously I\u2019m not going to sleep right away so sometimes when I\u2019m taking her to work, I\u2019m running on 4 hours of sleep. Yet she wants to have full blown conversations. I felt bad because I blew up on her one day without thinking she probably talks to me so much because she wants to spend that little time we have together. I don\u2019t think your TA but I would definitely start a conversation and ask her why she feels the need to talk to you when you\u2019re already tired.", "So I suffer from anxiety, and when I\u2019m feeling stressed or \u201cburnout\u201d (I think that\u2019s what it called) from my job and I want to just stay home and decompress, I feel guilty about feeling like that and I\u2019ll ask my husband if I should. Because even if I am an adult I still feel like I need permission to \u201cslack off\u201d from my responsibilities. And yea sometimes I just complain about my job to the point where my husband will just tell me to stay home and relax. I do believe your gf needs a \u201cmental health day\u201d as they are calling it, and I believe she\u2019s looking for permission to take one.", "NTA but she's clearly wanting your attention and you're just not providing it.", "NTA.

Same reasons you listed.", "INFO\n\n> I normally wake up around 10, and go to sleep around 1. \n\nYou need\n\n#NINE HOURS\n\nof sleep on a weeknight?!?\n\nI'm lucky if I get six.", "NTA, I am a super light sleeper and any kind of disturbance will keep me up. I used to work overnights so I understand to a degree what you go through with wanting to sleep in. \n\nIt sounds like she wants you to be sympathetic for her, without being empathetic with you about your sleep schedule. She needs to check her attitude and stop expecting people around her to drop everything they're doing just to comfort her. News flash, everyone goes to work and doesn't like waking up early. Stfu and move on from it. It's not the end of the world and you're not special. \n\nI wake up at 5am as a gas pipe fitter for my local utilities company, so I can say with 100% certainty that my job is far more difficult, especially having to wake up earlier than her. I don't go around to everyone in my house and wake them up just to fucking complain. If she doesn't apologize, leave her ass to cry to someone else about her marginally difficult job.", "NTA, she is not respecting your job and what is required to do it. You\u2019re not a bad person or don\u2019t care about her because you want to sleep.", "No you\u2019re not at all. Sleep is a human NEED. You\u2019re a saint for not tweaking on her imo.", "Nta!", "To me you sound like a crybaby. 3rd time you\u2019ve been woken up a few hours early in a TWO MONTH SPAN.

Grow up.", "NTA \n\nAs others pointed out, I'm sure she wouldn't want to be woken up at 1 AM to hear about your day/ complaints/ support you then. \n\nShe's being unfair and that's all there is to it. Yes she may need support and that's fair to ask but you don't get to set the time and place that suits you when it is very consequential to the other person. Support shouldn't be at someone else's actual EXPENSE.", "Lol, it\u2019s his fault she needs his attention at 7am! This isn\u2019t an issue about not getting attention, it\u2019s an issue about her not having independent coping strategies for how TERRIBLE waking up early is?", "[deleted]", "It only gets more difficult with kids \ud83e\udd7a", "Can you come talk to my kids?!

No answer here will make her not an asshole for selfishly waking him up for her own needs.", "Ah yes cause healthy relationships thrive on payback and being petty", "You completely missed the point. She's not an asshole for wanting a bit of connection and support for her partner, but she is an asshole for how she's going about getting that connection and support.", "Why is her need to be heard more important than OPs sleep?", "Some of the responses here defending her are wild to me - she's neglected, she needs attention, etc. In what world is it okay to wake your partner up from their sleep just so you can vent? Then to not only dismiss your partner outright when they explain that it's affecting them negatively, but to make it all about yourself -  it's just beyond gross and disrespectful.\n\nShe sounds immature, and I'd have turned it right back on her that if she really cared about you, she would let you sleep.", "> if 8am isn't the time to do it, when IS?\n\nHow about a time when he's awake? What a ridiculous question, lol.", "Perhaps if she doesn't mind and wants to talk about he could wake her when he gets home at 1?", "> Lol, it\u2019s his fault\n\nI never suggested that.", "He could wake her up when he gets home from the restaurant so she has an opportunity to talk about it.  She doesn't seem to see a problem in interrupting sleep and wants to talk so he could accommodate her that way.", "Yeah he can wake her up at 2 AM to bitch about working I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll love that", "He starts work at 4. Trying to vent to him at 7 or 8 AM is ridiculous if his normal wake time is 10 AM. Are you regularly waking up your partner 2 hours early just to complain?", "The GF is not dealing with their emotions in a mature way. GF wouldn't appreciate being woken up at 4AM to get complained at, GF shouldn't be waking OP to complain in the middle of their sleep cycle.", "No, she's still wrong for waking him up just to vent. People need proper sleep.", "The GF needs to approach the situation in a mature and considerate way -- by talking to the OP when they are both awake.\n\nRight now, she's choosing the time as a punitive measure.

You don\u2019t need to spend every day with your partner lol.", "Maybe he *is* waking her up at 2 AM and this is her revenge? Maybe he is really loud when he comes home?", "It'll make her realise what she's doing to him. Or should he just roll over, show his tummy and take it?", "One could also say that OP is TA for effectively telling her that he\u2019s not interested in giving her emotional support if it\u2019s not a convenient time for him.", "I think you missed the point. It seems they have little to no time in common together. 8am works for her but not for him. I am encouraging OP to look at what is driving his GF to do this - she wants to talk, she doesn't just want to eff up his sleep.", "Definitely. Post work is no substitute for a full day off.

So many people here making assumptions of she wants to spend more time with OP, etc.\n\nFirst, that's not true at all based on what OP said. She wants to complain about her job, it sounds more like.\n\nSecond, even if that is true, it in no way absolves her of being an asshole for waking OP up early.\n\nJust crazy how people will dig and dig and dig to make up some interpretation of the situation in their mind that makes the woman not an asshole, yet they do the exact opposite and will dig and dig and dig to find any reason to call a man an asshole.", "This situation doesn't seem like that though.. all that OP asked was not to talk about work stress in the mornings as it's also effecting his mental health for the rest of the day.

Every day he woke up complaining and I'd be on late shift. If it's a bad time at work I get it, but no partner should have to sacrifice their sleep schedule for complaining that isn't looking for a solution. It's all about balance.
