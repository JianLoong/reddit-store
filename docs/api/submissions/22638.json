My gf works at a daycare and I work at a restaurant, so she typically leaves for work around 8am while I typically leave for work at around 4pm. This means she\u2019s waking up at 7am, and going to sleep around 11pm, while I normally wake up around 10, and go to sleep around 1. \n\nThis has generally worked fine; she will get up and leave me sleeping until she comes and says goodbye around 8, but doesn\u2019t wake me up fully so I can easily drift back asleep. I want her to do this, since I like being able to wish her a good day and see her for a second, but it doesn\u2019t interfere with my sleep. \n\nHowever, today is the 3rd time in the past month or two that she has fully woke me up around 7 to complain and whine about going in to work. It\u2019s basically just like \u201cI really really don\u2019t want to go to work, I\u2019m so tired,\u201d, etc. I have issues falling back asleep, not to mention waking up to immediate negative energy, so the couple times this has happened has really thrown off the rest of my day. \n\nToday, I politely explained to her that while I love her and I have complete sympathy for her stressful job and early hours, she needs to consider how waking me up will negatively impact my day, and that if her job/schedule was causing her that much stress it might be time for a different opportunity. She got upset and told me that if I couldn\u2019t handle waking up a couple hours early to comfort her then I don\u2019t care about her enough, and that it happens so infrequently that I should be there for her. \n\nI\u2019ve received split responses from friends, so wanted to know what you guys thought.

Sleep is too important for your overall well-being to be interrupted.", "ESH- you want her to wake you to see her for a second, but complain if she does it too much. You work opposite schedules. In a relationship you are each other\u2019s support system. You are her rock. Some times she needs to lean on you. She sucks for waking you up for petty things like not wanting to go into work. No body does. But if it\u2019s a legit mental health thing and she needs to vent let her. Maybe you could consider switching shifts or finding a new job. That was you get more time with each other. I mean its not like you have a career type job. You can always find a better paying job in a restaurant during the day time or a new field completely.", "NTA", "NTA - if she wants more time to talk to you she should convey that to you, and it should occur when youre awake.", "When you go to bed at 1am, wake her up and say this is a good time for you two to talk.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nThat's pretty rude, waking you up on not a lot of sleep, just to complain about getting up early. You offered solutions to her problem, and she hasn't taken steps to resolve her problem. If she isn't going to do anything positive about her situation, she doesn't get to wake you up to complain about it.", "NAH. I fully understand: when my sleep is disrupted my entire day is off. But also, when I feel like I\u2019m not being heard, my entire day is equally off.

However, she wants to spend more time together and vent to you about her job because she feels like she can trust you and that you will understand. Maybe ya'll can schedule some time in the evenings when you're both off work so that you can just enjoy each other's company and if she needs to vent give her the space to do so. It's difficult because ya'll have conflicting work hours but there's a way around that for sure. It'll take effort from both of ya'll though.", "NTA - if she doesn\u2019t see your viewpoint, wake her up when you get home from work to start venting about your shift.

Given your respective work and sleep schedules, it seems like you wouldn\u2019t talk to each other at all during the week unless she wakes you or you wake her.

I can understand why this new occurrence doesn't work for you. It's much more disruptive than the normal pattern you had. I think this is a symptom of the challenge of working such different schedules. It sounds like you have pretty much no common time together (outside of your days off I presume) and I don't blame her if she has needs and a desire to talk to you, when it feels like that opportunity practically does not exist. It's fair for her to want to vent *sometimes,* and if 8am isn't the time to do it, when IS?", "NAH.  I've worked shifts opposite my spouse in the past and the whole lack of time together actually killed that marriage.  She misses you.  I get that being awakened messes with your sleep and between your two careers at the moment, you probably don't have days off together.\n\nThe next day off you have, sit down with her and discuss how the two of you can carve out a bit more time for each other.  Perhaps she can get a new job at child care center that has night hours, or you can ask to have a day shift job at your employer's one day a week to give her more of your time.", "NTA.

It's not cool of the gf to wake him up but a relationship won't survive if you have no time together. Opposite shifts kill relationships.", "If GF is the one who wants or need more together time then she should be the one who stay up later or wakes up when OP get home to get that quality time.", "I wasn't saying that girlfriend's method was correct, I was explaining where she was coming from. She clearly  has to comunicate better."]}
