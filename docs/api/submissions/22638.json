There are a load of situations that cause people to shroud their meaning.\n\nFor example, people who think there's nothing to be done about a situation they're upset about may avoid bringing it up, even when it's making them upset, because they don't want to be a burden. For example a woman in this situation may not be thinking \"I want my partner to figure out what I'm feeling and fixing it,\" but \"there's nothing to be done about this situation so I don't want to burden my partner with my feelings.\"\n\nOr perhaps a person might not actually be insightful about their own feelings. Feeling something without being able to perfectly identify the problem causing that feeling can be a totally normal, human experience. This is one reason therapy exists, but that sort of insight is something that happens on a lot of smaller scales to people all the time. It's totally normal for someone to know they feel lonely and rejected and misattribute the cause to \"my boyfriend isn't able to wake up in the morning to say goodbye to me\" when they would actually continue to feel lonely as long as the work schedule stays as it is, as an example. \n\nThere's also the fact it's totally normal for someone to quietly, even unconsciously, decide on the solution to a problem and then get attached to the solution and not realize their problem can be solved in alternative ways. Sometimes they haven't even privately put the problem into words, they just think of something they want to do without identifying the reason behind wanting to do it. A person might think \"I want to speak with my partner before work,\" without realizing that that they want to speak with their partner before work because they're just *generally lonely* and their loneliness might be solved from spending more time with their partner *at other times*. \n\nThese are all things that flawed humans do-- if you want a relationship with a person and not a robot, this is the type of situations that human brains can end up in sometimes. You aren't responsible to psychically figure these sorts of things out for your partner, but just saying \"I need you to be direct with me,\" isn't going to make regular flawed humans more capable of not falling into these situations without realizing it, and you shouldn't be acting like a person legitimately having difficult feelings without realizing it, not knowing how to verbalize those feelings, not wanting to verbalize those feelings for whatever reason, or anything in that family of just \"not being perfectly insightful to themselves\" that I might be missing isn't some ableist villain. Relationships are two way streets-- she needs to communicate, but if there are issues forming that he notices before she verbalizes, he should be reaching out to her to open the discussion at least.", "Yeah, if he doesn't get to go back to sleep after the interruption, the rest of the time he is in bed doesn't really count. And even if he could go back to sleep, interrupted sleep doesn't allow for the normal progression of sleep cycles, so it's likely he will still be less rested than if he had 8-9 uninterrupted hours.", "But you did call her an asshole either.", "NTA.\nI tend to go to sleep a few hours later than my boyfriend. So when he wakes up earlier then me and decides to wakes me up super early, I get upset. I'm tiredddddd. I get how you feel.", "NTA, but you and your GF need to find time to talk when you are not exhausted. It sounds to me like she would benefit from a career change.", "NAH. What is the point of a relationship if you can't wake them up on rare occasions when you're having a bad time emotionally?  I get it's a problem if it were every day. But three times in a whole relationship? Calm down.", "Ah, capitalism conflicts with love once again. And no, you\u2019re not the asshole\u2014it\u2019s just a challenging situation schedule-wise.", "NTA, she's likely cheating on you and wants to talk about it but is a coward. Don't fuck her ever again and tell her she needs to sleep on the couch, unless she isn't on the lease, in which case tell her to made some plans in the next month to get out. Leave zero chance for a \"I'm pregnant scare!\" And if she gets you drunk one night and you can't handle yourself, slip her a Plan B and watch her like a hawk to make sure she doesn't puke it back up.", "NTA. I say this as someone who has struggled with sleep and insomnia since I was 15 years old. Sleep. Is. Precious. Being woken up and having your sleep cycle disturbed is rude and inconsiderate. If gf needs to have more time having emotionally deep conversations with him, gf also needs to put her adulting pants on and clearly articulate that. \n\nBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. She wants to whine and get sympathy, and that want is more important than his boundary. I was in a similar situation - I am not a morning person, literally will not communicate before 9am, and yet despite making that very very clear, she would talk to me and whine and complain and expect full conversations at 7am when I\u2019m staring into my tea like a goblin. I would get seething mad. \n\nDon\u2019t violate someone\u2019s boundaries. Don\u2019t decide sleep is less important for them. And for people calling him the AH or whatever, imagine this post but the genders are switched. Reddit would tear the hypothetical BF apart for not valuing or appreciating how hard she works.", "That is a massive leap in logic. We have 0 information that alludes to that.", "Agreed. I miss being on night shift, cause my afternoons were just as free as my friends and partner who work morning shifts. Swing is the worst shift option.", "She is TA", "Your NTA but do try to like switch shifts(with someone else) to be able to just have one hour with your partner", "you are not an AH.  No one likes to be awakened early to listen to complaints they cannot resolve.  See if you can find a compatible time when you are both rested.  Prep the discussion by asking if your girlfriend want s solutions, or just time to complain.  .Waking someone up is not the right time for either choice.  kt", "definitely NTA, everyone is different.. i know i despise being woken up early. For some reason a lot of girls are obsessed with waking their man up it\u2019s pretty common. But you have to put ur foot down at some point if it\u2019s affecting you. If she can\u2019t understand your reasons, is she even worth it?", "Its understandable that she misses you and wants to talk to you. Its also understandable that its no fun for her to have to get up when you are cosy sleeping.\n\nBUT its not fair that she expects you to give up sleep,  so she can get attention. This is an issue you both need to sort together and compromise TOGETHER. You should not miss out on sleep, while she gets a full nights rest.\n\nNTA"]}
