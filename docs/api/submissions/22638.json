She cannot stay up late without missing sleep. If she sleeps from 11-7, and works from 8-6, he is already at work. By the time he gets home, it\u2019s (from experience working the same job) 10-11 or later. He goes to bed at 1 am and wakes at 10 am. Giving him 6 hours of waking time that she is at work for, before he goes to work. He could theoretically be awake for that less-than-an-hour period in the morning and nap an hour later that day before work. Or sleep longer, until 11 or noon. She doesn\u2019t have that option. They clearly do not get enough time to see each other. There is no way they\u2019re spending enough valuable time together, then include a period of high stress, when you need mental support, which you clearly have not needed before, this issue becomes inevitable.", "A small sacrifice, like not waking your partner up so you can suffer together?", "Lol you seem to have missed my second comment, I knew you\u2019d say that haha so I addressed it", ">I think this guy isn\u2019t emotional or physically available enough for his girlfriend.\n\nThere's nothing for you to base this on.\n\nI'm not here to talk about what you assume to be true, especially when you've pulled it from the deepest recess of your arse.", "That's kind of just what people do in relationships, though. You make little sacrifices SOMETIMES so your partner might be happier. I work overnights and there has been the odd time when my husband has phoned me in the middle of the day and woken me up. I don't know, if he feels like he needs me then Im up. I've woken him in the night for less than important reasons. \n\nAre you in a loving relationship? With another human? Jeez my girl friends have destroyed my sleep for total bs and I'll wake up for them. Whatever. They would and have done the same for me. \n\nIt's really not a huge deal. I don't understand why you're all over this thread losing your mind over 3/50ish  nights of sleep for this guy.", "No, I saw it.\n\nIt changes nothing.\n\nYou addressed fuck all mate.", "[removed]", "It\u2019s not an insult or something he is doing wrong.

Glad we agree.\n\nShe didn't need him.\n\nThere's no need for her to wake him up so she can complain about having to wake up.\n\nAnybody who seriously cares about their partner would understand that helps nobody and all you're doing is spreading the suffering.\n\nWhy couldn't she wait a few hours for him to wake up and speak on the phone? \n\nWhy can't she vent at lunch?\n\nWhy did she absolutely have to wake him up then and there?\n\n\nOf course everyone who disagrees with you, is doing so because they have nobody in their lives.", "[removed]", "\n\nI hate women because I think she's unreasonable to wake him up to complain that she has to wake up early?\n\nDefinitely.\n\nVag bad pp the best.", "Well, surely she's equally at fault?\n\nWhy is it a failing from him that *both* of their schedules conflict?\n\nWhy didn't you say \"they aren't available for *each other*\".\n\nIt's pretty sexist to put it all on him.\n\nSo yeah, you definitely were implying something wrong, or you'd have been neutral in your writing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
