I\u2019m not that close to his, but we are friendly when we see each other. Our parents are really close. At first my parent were the ones invited to the wedding, but because there health conditions they couldn\u2019t risk driving for 5 hours in the summer, public transport was not the option since it would take a minimum of 8 hours. After talking it over with him, their invite was transferred to me so I 25m can go as the family representative.\r  \nSince I was going I contributed to the gift 600 euro + some really expensive glasses and bottle. I booked a hotel room for 2 nights, took a day of work and drove to the capital Friday morning (I also wanted to go sightseeing).\r  \nYesterday I went to the church an hour before the ceremony (normal in case they need help, if not you stay out of their way) and congratulated my cousin\u2019s parents. I was talking with other relatives when the first started. Some woman was calling another woman a who\\*\\*and they were screaming at each other, they were pulled apart. Then this drunken guy 40\u2019s I think came and overturned a candleholder (2m, large, made out of metal). And then the bride came to fight with a girl wearing a white dress (it might have been a wedding dress, but it looked like my grandmothers curtains).\r  \nThe ceremony went well I think, but then came the time for photos. The wife was shouting at everyone, having use do different poses and randomly switching family members (every family was supposed to take a picture the couple), I ended up in the picture with a family from her side I believe.\r  \nIt got annoying at that point. While everybody was getting ready to drive to the park for the next photo shoot, I found a cousin I\u2019m close with and asked him if he could drop of the money and present, because I was tired. He agreed, after most people left I loaded the box in his car and then drove off. I changed clothes and visited some museums and I spend the night reading in the bathtub, while eating Chinese food.\r  \nI looked at my Facebook today and I was bombarded with messages for ruining the wedding. Apparently I was seen leaving the gift with my cousin and many relatives decided to do the same, so around 25 people didn\u2019t show up. Then when the bride insulted the last living grandma in the family (the youngest of my grandma\u2019s siblings 91), because she gifted them a 40-year-old tea set (unused) that wasn\u2019t on the list, most of the remaining relatives left.\r  \nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my fault. I congratulated them and left them the gift day wanted plus money, and it\u2019s not like I told people to leave or made a scene.

You did the right thing to leave before it got worse.

Personally I would have kept the money after they behaved that way.\n\nHowever if that's what they are like before the alcohol really starts flowing then it should have been a sight to behold at the reception afterwards when the bar is open.
