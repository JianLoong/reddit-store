I edited my comment after you read it because I don't think it was as clear as I intended, but to reiterate: you should cut off all financial support to her if you're doing more than the streaming services.  She needs to learn to support herself and not waste all of her money on drugs and alcohol.  She can't do that with a family that doesn't allow her to fail as harsh as that sounds.  \n\nYWBTA if you kept supporting her despite knowing she is essentially using you/your family so she can continue her addiction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into your post, but the comment you made about her spending all of her money on drugs/alcohol is concerning and it sounds like your family is enabling her.  \n\nIf my intuition with that is correct, then I've been in your shoes and I think you're doing better than I did at that age by seeking advice from outside of your family.  Hopefully that all makes sense.", "> so idk why she's mad\n\nshe is mad because it's her way or no way at all.", "I have the same issue with my older siblings,  I'm the baby but the only one to hold down a job or even have my life together.
