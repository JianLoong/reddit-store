Telling your husband that you're hurt by his actions is \"a tantrum\"? Does he do that a lot? Mess up, and then when you point it out he accuses you of being hysterical, or cruel, or overreacting, or being sensitive? Because if so, you have bigger problems than your husband not telling people you're his wife. NTA", "NTA\nGood grief.  Us guys are infamous for not sharing a lot of details, but how do you forget to mention you're married?  Or mention your spouse at all?  And, what's stopping him from fixing it by calling his friend right now?", "NTA. And if he doesn\u2019t call his friend immediately and fix his big mistake he is an even bigger AH.", "NTA, and this is kind of a red flag, so keep your eyes open. He made a mistake, and if I were you, he would not be going to this wedding. He can decline and let them know he doesn\u2019t want to leave his WIFE. They may extend an invitation after that, but I wouldn\u2019t ask directly.", "NTA. Prediction - unfortunately, you will not be married for long. if you husband is hiding marriage from his friends, it is not real", "INFO - how did your husband meet this guy and how long have they known each other? Does the the friend at least know that you two have kids together?", "NTA he should be proud to show off his wife. I'd be pissed too.", "INFO: So, who came to your wedding?\n\nOP, this is a huge red flag that there's another woman.", "Did you not have a wedding?", "NTA.\nRed flags everywhere.", "NTA. But your husband sure is. There's a difference between keeping your private life private & not telling your friends that you got married. He is showing you a total lack of respect by not telling his friends that he & you are now married.", "You're only 22, have been married 7 months and have children plural. You have bigger problems than having your name left off a wedding invite.", "I don't think you're an AH, don't think your hubby is an AH, and don't think the long distance friend is an AH for this to have gone down like this.  You've got kids, sounds like you've been living together for a while, and haven't done the big party wedding yet, just a little legal one. So to many people, including a lot of clueless guys like me, nothing has really changed.  The friend is leaning towards being an AH, he SHOULD have invited you but maybe there was a mixup. Your hubby SHOULD IMMEDIATELY call said friend and tell him about it and see that it gets fixed.  If your hubby doesn't call he is an AH and huge red flag; if friend doesn't fix the situation he is an AH.  And I totally get why you're unhappy and confused by all of this.  LIke someone else said, many of us guys are clueless about what needs to be communicated and what doesn't.  I've had friends tell me months later that a parent or sibling died, and one even told us about his 3rd wedding after it happened.  When I talk to people on the phone I am short and to the point, convey the facts relevant to the purpose of the call, then bye!  If your hubby and his friend are like this, I could see the actual marriage slipping by.", "INFO: Does he wear his wedding ring?", "\"If you don't want to let people know we are married, that can be really easily handled by us not being married any longer.\"\n\nPlease note, he STILL doesn't want to tell his friend(s) that you two are married. He'd rather skip the wedding in order to keep you a secret.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This could he a huge red flag. If I were you, I would check his activities and our life together more in detail.", "INFO: did his friend invite hubby's other wife?", "I\u2019m petty. \n\nI\u2019d be making a post on whatever socials he has, introducing yourself as his wife since you recently found out he never told anyone you were married. \n\nHe is either extremely terrible at communicating, doesn\u2019t give a sh** about being married to you, or keeping his options open for affairs.\n\nNTA .", "NTA but it looks like you married one. It sounds suspicious that he doesn't tell people you are married. Has he now told his friend that you're married and will you now get an invitation to this other wedding. If you don't I would be wondering why, especially if he decides to attend by himself.", "NTA, if it was a friend they weren't in much contact with who sent an invite out of the blue that would be another story, but they spike about the wedding well in advance of receiving the invitation, surely he could have said \"oh and I'll be bringing my wife\"", "I guess it depends how close the friend is, there are loads of people I know who I might not be in touch with all that often, not invite them to the wedding, not necessarily tell them until the next time I saw them.\n\nHas your husband actually met this person since you were married? Presumably they weren't invited to the wedding?\n\nI'm going YTA, these things happen, not everybody broadcasts their life to everybody they know.\n\nUnless he actually \\*hid\\* that he was married, I'm not sure what the big deal is.\n\nAll honesty, it \\*does\\* kind of sound like a tantrum.", "Are you maybe getting a separate invitation since you aren't married? Being a couple and having children together should get your name on an invite. \n\nNTA.", "Your husband is sketchy. An acquaintance married a guy who didnt tell anyone he was married. He cheated on her", "NTA. Your husband is rude and inconsiderate. Does he have any good qualities? This is shady.", "NTA. You are married, either both of you are invited or neither of you are invited.. you don't invite half of a married couple to a wedding, that's bloody rude.  He needs to contact his friend to ask what's going on and if you still aren't invited then decline the invitation.  If he thinks them not inviting you is ok I'd be having second thoughts about your marriage.", "NTA  Good grief!  What is this guy's problem?  Something else is going on here.  I'd want to get to the bottom of it.\n\nAlso he deflected by saying you were throwing a tantrum...  I'm not one to use the term gaslighting, but isn't this it?  Somebody help me out here.", "NAH men and women communicate differently especially to friends , women seem to make more of a Fuss about things like this, I found out from one of my best friends that his mam had died 3 months before and he had never said anything. I don't think your husband meant anything by it , it probably just never came up. But I understand why you would be upset as it seems like he doesn't care.

But I've seen people do stupid things with invites...  I've also seen invites get lost in the mail, forgetten in someone's car, sent to the wrong address, etc. \n\nBut my impression of the OP was more being upset that her husband's friend didn't know they where married.  Which at first seemed really odd - and candidly unacceptable. \n\nUntil I learned their \"wedding\" isn't until November - which the friend is invited to attend.  Again, in my simple mind, if I'm attending someone's \"wedding\" 7 months from now - my working assumption is they aren't married yet.\n\nAnd my point is it's entirely possible this is simply a misunderstanding - based in large part - to the \"wedding\" that's 7 months away.  It doesn't HAVE to be an intentional slight to the OP, or a \"red flag\" for the husband. \n\nBut at the same time, it doesn't give the husband a \"pass\" or absolve them off any actual slights or other \"red flags\".

This is my personality, while i'm really chatty and randomly oversharing at other opportunities.\n\nSo I would tend not to overvalue the incident even if it hurt you. I'd say none here but you can judge this with the amount of info you provided.

Neither or both. So he didn\u2019t inform anyone outside of who already knew that you were recently married. Ok. Not the end of the world. Maybe he likes to keep things private. Maybe he just didn\u2019t want others impeding on his happiness for a bit. Is he able to inform the parties that he is in fact married and will not be attending without you. He said as much to you. \n\nLet me give you some perspective. I told everyone and anyone that I was married. I was happy and couldn\u2019t help but express that happiness with everyone. Some people were happy that I was happy. Others were annoyed with my happiness. There were more people annoyed with my happiness then there were people  happy because I was happy.

The friend is invited to your upcoming wedding ceremony, so friend knows you exist and at the very least engaged.  So the question still stands why not include you in the invite to their wedding.  Hate to jump to conclusions but the behavior of both your husband and his friend open up the door for it.  If you were to say you are ok for your husband to go alone because you weren't invited, would he actually go without you?  Is there a possibility you weren't invited because this was a setup for your husband to have a secret rendezvous with a old college flame at the wedding?  You need to ask your husband  a lot of questions and he needs to answer and not deflect.", "I'm sorry you see expressing feelings as being an asshole."]}
