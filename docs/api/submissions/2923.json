{"id": 2923, "submission_id": "z1esbs", "title": "AITA for not helping my boyfriend clean before his parents come to visit?", "selftext": "My boyfriend Jay (M35) and I (F33) recently moved in together. We love our new apartment and try to take good care of it. On the regular, I definitely pick up more of the household chores than he does, but he does a decent amount to keep things clean. \n\nJay\u2019s parents are coming to visit for Thanksgiving, and I will not be here (I am going home to visit my parents this year.) His parents visit a lot. I\u2019m talking like every 2-3 weeks since my boyfriend\u2019s older sister recently had a baby and she lives in the same city as us. He also has a younger brother who lives near us. Jay\u2019s parents are insistent on staying at our apartment over his brother or sister\u2019s place when they come visit because they find it the most comfortable. I like his parents, but do find their constant visits a little overwhelming. Jay agrees, but isn\u2019t comfortable confronting them about it. \n\nAnyway; their last visit was three weeks ago. Jay had a business trip scheduled. They asked if they could still stay with me even though Jay wasn\u2019t going to be around. I asked Jay if they could maybe stay at one of his siblings\u2019 places instead, but our place is definitely the biggest and most comfortable so he felt bad asking them to cram in to his brother or sister\u2019s spot. It wasn\u2019t a huge deal so I agreed. They day before they were set to arrive Jay left on his business trip. He\u2019d had a stressful week and so the apartment was pretty messy when he left. I didn\u2019t want his parents to come stay in a messy place, so I spent my whole Friday night cleaning for their visit- doing all the laundry and putting it away, washing all the sheets and towels for them and setting up the guest bed, dishes, vacuuming. Jay was very grateful, but if I\u2019m being completely honest I was a little annoyed by the situation- me hosting his parents and being the only one prepping for their arrival despite there being other family members nearby who could have stepped in (I did share that with Jay, and he understood and apologized for putting me in that situation.)\n\nAnyway, his parents are set to arrive tomorrow and Jay and I have both been slammed with work for the past few days. I left to go home to my family today, and admittedly left the place a little messy because I was stressed and rushing. Jay just got home from work and texted me, saying he\u2019s super annoyed that I left the apartment messy and saying he doesn\u2019t have time to properly clean it before his parents arrive. I pointed out how I cleaned and took care of his parents without his help last time, and mentioned that he\u2019s not the only one busy with work and that we both need to be taking care of things equally around the house. He told me I was being spiteful and is now being short and cold towards me. I really feel like he\u2019s viewing this situation selfishly, but he seems VERY annoyed with me.

Jay\u2019s being a jerk. He should come around and acknowledge as much once he\u2019s less stressed about the situation.", "NTA \n\nHe did no cleaning before his trip and you did all the work. \n\nNow the tables have turned and he criticizes you.   \n\nNope, that's not going to work.   He should have done some cleaning before his last trip or looked at the two situations as being the same and sucked it up and done the cleaning for Thanksgiving without complaint.   \n\nNo one likes to do all of the cleaning.    But sometimes you have to.  \n\nAnd he's going to have to tell his parents they can only stay over once ever three months.   They have other kids - let them stay with their other children.  \nIt's unfair for you to have to be their hosts every time.", "NTA - why is it on you to keep the place clean, especially when a) you're not even there and b) you don't want his parents visiting as often as they do but he won't say no to them.", "NTA, you are a good partner. Jay need to let us all know if there's a popping sound when he pulls his head out of his a\\*\\*.", "NTA\n\nTheir visits are excessive.  And they're your BF's guests, not yours.  Tell him that from now on, he can do all the preparations for his parents visits.  And you'll do all the prep for your guests.  That means he has do the extra cleaning, wash the sheets in the guest room, buy the groceries and cook for them, and be present to host his parents. \n\nFor your part, you need to not go out of your way for your BF's guests.  Don't go home early to let them in, don't cook them breakfast, don't alter your plans.", "NTA. Your answer to him hits the nail on the head. It\u2019s a shared responsibility and if he let household work pile up as much as you did, he is in no place to be angry at you. Especially after those situations where you had to spend much time to clean the pile happened before and could have lead to improvement of chore management.", "NTA. If their visits are stressing you all out this much, he needs to grow a back bone and say no sometimes. Overnight visits 1-2 a month means they shouldn\u2019t be judging your little messes. They can get a hotel if they want a spotless place to crash.", "NTA but I think it's time you put your foot down about how you feel about hosting his parents so frequently.", "I was on the fence at first but halfway through it's clear your NTA. It's basically a repeat of what happened when your BF had to leave, except you're the one leaving instead. I don't see what's so unfair about the situation. \n\nAlso not for nothing, but if his parents are visiting this often, they shouldn't expect a spotless place every time their over if it's once a month. Especially around the holidays like people get busy and sometimes it's not possible to have everything spotless. So there's some laundry piled up, maybe the dishwasher is full and still needs to be run/unloaded, maybe the garbage is a little full, etc. \n\nSounds like you guys need to have a chat about expectations about his parents visiting and explain to them that if they're going to be coming so often that on occasion the place might be a bit messy and if they don't like that then there's always BFs siblings to stay at. \n\nYeah you're def not T A,", "NTA - also, you guys need to have a serious talk about who lives in that apartment bc at this point his parents should be paying rent if they are there every month.   \n\n\nThis place is 50% yours and you deserve to have a say in how often guests are there.", "NTA jay can do some quick dishes, clean off the tables and shove anything else in closets and get the house looking decent on his own in a decent amount of time. I\u2019d let him know you are sorry you were too busy to help this time around and make it clear this isn\u2019t a tit for tat after the last parent visit.", "Every 2 - 3 weeks?  Oh, hell, no. NTA. And bf needs to say no. They want to see the baby?  Stay there and help - oh, wait....", "NTA in the simplest terms - not your monkeys not your circus", "NTA.  It is not *only* your responsibility to clean the apt.  Yea it is unfortunate that your husband has to put in a bit of extra effort, but life is like that sometimes.\n\nAs you  pointed out, you've hosted his parents with and without your husband, etc.  You've been cooperative and kind in this situation.  \n\nLast thought, maybe his parents should see how much effort you and husband put into working busy schedules, traveling, and hosting them monthly.  Honestly, that would drive me crazy.  \n\nYou might have a pleasant surprise.  Maybe MIL & FIL will pitch in and help out?  If they are there that often, they should be anyway.  \n\nEnjoy your Thanksgiving and tell your husband that you're busy helping your family and can't check the phone frequently.  Take a break for yourself.", "NTA and your bf needs to talk to his parents about their frequent visits. It\u2019s not fair to you, it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re more comfortable in your place", "NTA -so if he gets mad, then he gets a free pass to do what he wants? If you want a long term happy relationship, don't be a doormat. He needs to treat you with respect. This is not being treated as an equal partner. Stand up for yourself.", "NTA - Actually, maybe you both should leave it sorry for their next visit, perhaps that will dissuade them from asking again\u2026?\n\nYour bf should grow a pair, and have the conversation with them.", "NTA.  Here\u2019s my question for Jay.  What did he hope to accomplish complaining and calling OP the AH? That she would cancel her trip to go back and help him clean?  If that is the case not only is Jay the AH but delusional as well.", "NTA\n\nIf his parents are there so frequently they are no longer special guests.  You both have lives - and guest level cleaning every few weeks is not realistic.\n\nJust have the place normal clean (i.e. cluttered and lived-in) and let his parents shift for themselves.  Don't make special meals or do all the dishes for them, don't put your lives on hold to cater to their needs.\n\nMy guess is that once you stop going out of your way to make it a 4 star stay they will stop staying as much.\n\nMore importantly - put your foot down and establish a rotation with his siblings. You should not be the only ones hosting.", "NTA but agree you all need to have some serious talks about distribution/ sharing of duties. Cleaning is not one person\u2019s job. It\u2019s an awful ongoing shared responsibility that will go on forever. The fact that it is his parents and they are frequent visitors does not help his case to get on your case. Relationships are teamwork- you both should want to help clean. Some days are harder and the other person needs to want to pick up the slack.", "NTA. \n\nHe needs to stand up to his parents. It\u2019s ridiculous that you have to host for them to visit other people.", "NTA but it is well past time for Jay to man up and tell his parents they can not come every month. They need to find other places to stay. If they don\u2019t want to stay with their other kids, there are hotels and airbnbs. This is having an impact on your life and your relationship and there doesn\u2019t seem to be an end in sight.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
