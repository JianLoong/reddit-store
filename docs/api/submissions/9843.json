I have to means to financially support myself and the cat (and I still manage to save money every month), my living arrangement is pet friendly and there will always be someone available to watch the cat if I need to go on holiday/go away for a weekend.\n\nMy parents (not cat people) think adopting a cat is a bad idea as my current job contract is only for a year and I will likely be moving at the end of the year if my contract isn\u2019t extended. They also say that I can\u2019t be certain I will be able to find pet friendly living when I move. For this reason, my parents think I should only adopt a cat once I am settled in a different, more permanent job. \nHowever, I know that even when I find another job, they will most likely say the same thing. Especially because my mom in particular wants me to move back into the family home after this contract ends. I feel like they still see me as a child because last year I was living with them as it was easier than finding somewhere else to live (I still paid rent and money towards groceries/utilities).\n\nI really have fallen in love with this cat and desperately want to adopt it (I have been approved for adoption), but I feel like my parents are going to have such an issue with this.

You're 24. It doesn't matter if they 'approve'.\n\nBut it is worth seriously thinking about what they're saying rather than their approval on general principle.\n\nIt is harder to find rentals with a cat than without. It is important to know that you will have enough financial stability to keep a cat after your currently fixed-term contract. You need to solve those questions for yourself. Can you reliably afford the rent involved in pet friendly renting, will you be able to afford a pet sitter after this place, can you afford pet insurance & vets, how stable are your job prospects at the end of this contract?\n\nIf you can realistically and confidently answer those questions for yourself, you don't have to worry about whether your parents will like it, but they're not wrong to ask the questions. You're just focusing on the wrong part of this.", "A word of advice, OP. At 24 and living fully on your own (financially and in actuality), this post sounds like you also still want to BE their kid. \n\nAs an independent adult, YOU decide this. If you decided to get the cat, you get it, take a zillion pics, and text your favorites everyone you\u2019re close to (friends and family) and that\u2019s when your parents find out that you got a cat. \n\nThis is not an AITA, post-there\u2019s no right or wrong answer. This is a-learn how to live as adults with respectable boundaries-post. Spend a little time thinking about why your not making these decisions on your own. I don\u2019t know the reason, but it\u2019s definitely something you can explore.", "NTA But do take some time to think about your living situation and realistically evaluate your chances of finding pet friendly accommodation in the future. My cat is 17 years old! Cats live a long time and whilst you can't predict everything you do need to be confident you can give them a stable long term home before adopting one. \n\nAlso as other people have said it's normally recommended to adopt 2 kittens or an older cat, but I guess it depends on the situation of the cat you're looking at.", "Nta. Since you don't live with them nor depend on them financially, you can go ahead and adopt.\n\nIf you do end up having to move houses, just make sure to start the apartment search earlier than usual, since it *can* sometimes be tricky to find a pet-friendly place that works for you.\n\nedit to add:\n\n>I feel like they still see me as a child ...

It's not your mother business. Anyway, if you know your mother wants you to move back into your family home against your wishes, but she hates cats, it is even more a reason to get this cat. Then you'll have an extra reason to decline moving back home (\"sorry mom, I can't live at your place because I know you don't like cats and I don't want to burden you with mine. And to be frank, I don't want to move back into my old room anyway\"), and she may be less inclined  to pressure you.", "NTA If your parents do not live with you then it is none of their business. You are not a child and you dont live with them. You are not required to follow their rules anymore.  \n\n\nAnd they know that, they are trying to bluff you.", "NTA\n\nYou don't live with them and they don't support you. Their opinion on the matter doesn't matter as they don't have to deal with the animal nor do they have to care for it. Their reasoning is quite funny too. As if you only having a one year contract would mean you'd have to move and you can't take the cat with you. I don't know where you live, but everywhere I've ever lived it's quite easy to find cat friendly rentals.", "NTA\n\nI grew up in a home where my parents hated the idea of pets. I badly badly wanted a dog or a cat and my parents always used to say, not in our home, you can have one when you have your own home, and believe me, the first thing I did when I turned 18, was get a cat. And it wasn't even the adopted one, it was a stray that used to come to my house at evenings and I used to sneak around my parents' backs and feed it outside my home.\n\n So I understand you, and go for it. Your parents are trying to control you and that is not okay. You are financially independent and can take care of the cat, and since you don't live with them, they don't get to have a say in whether you should get one or not. \n\nGet the little floof ball.", "NTA.  Honestly - your folks are right in that having a cat will make it harder for you - you are more home bound (though it sounds like you have that sorted) and places tend to prefer no pets so maybe harder to get a rental.... but you know this, and if you really want one OP, I say go for it.  Cats are not dogs, I wouldn't even judge someone getting a dog harshly, but cats take way less attention and cost.  I confess - I AM a cat guy - I love my fuzzy little hairball - I've always had a cat and always will most likely so that might skew my opinion.", "NTA! But please get two kittens. Never one kitten. Cats very often develop behaviour problems when they live solo as kittens. Good news for you though - twice the love! And tell your parents to stop parenting you so much. You're an adult. Tell them to give you a chance to show them that.", "You're asking the Reddit crowd if you should get a cat lol\n\nReading your story, i think your parents are probably right only because if you don't get your contact extended where do you plan to go? Back home? What does that mean for the cat?", "NTA. Get a cat if you want a cat. Cats are awesome and I'm sure you'll find a way to make it work. You don't need to have figured out your whole life plan before you get a pet.\n\nMy one piece of advice: why adopt one kitten when you could adopt two kittens? If you have one kitten, it will constantly attack your feet. If you have two kittens, they will sometimes attack each other instead of your feet.", "NTA. As a fellow cat lover I suggest you get the cat asap. Cats make life so much more fun :)", "YTA for wanting to adopt just one kitten. They need playmates. Lots of shelters even refuse to adopt out single kittens if you don't already have a cat/kitten at home. \nCats are not solitary creatures.

Your parents just want you to move back in and the cat would keep you from doing that.", "Something to be aware of is that, depending on where you live, it is likely to be much, much less of a problem to rent with a cat now than it used to be. In the US at least, 20-30 years ago, rentals that allowed any pets were a small portion of what was available.\n\nNow they are increasingly common, and this is especially true with cats. Dogs may face size or breed restrictions, or strict rules about barking and cleanup. With a cat, your landlords' main concern will be damage. You will have to pay a larger deposit and a little bit of extra rent. If your cat claws or chews on the apartment interior, you may have some extra costs at moveout. And this will vary by region and by the price point at which you're renting. But it's not as much of an issue as it used to be, so your parents' point of view may be skewed by that. They probably knew people who had serious housing challenges because of a pet.\n\nIf you want to reassure yourself (whether or not you think it would help with the parents) you can use a rental website to search apartments in cities you think you might be living in, and set the filter to \"pet friendly\" that will give you an idea of just how rare pet-friendly housing is in that location. You may be surprised, as you will often see that 60-80% of apartment rentals in the area allow cats.\n\nBut in any case, this isn't up to your parents.
