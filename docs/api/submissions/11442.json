Let her pay for respite care, or put him into an old folks home.", "NTA. Some nursing homes take people for a few weeks or months. Can't your MIL do that or if she feels better find one near you? That's a lot to take on even without kids.", "NTA... He needs to be put in respite care, that is the safest option OR she needs to cancel and book when someone is available. This is not something you should handle on your own.  Your husband can take a leave of absense from work if he want to enable his mother.", "As soon as you said he needs help showering, etc\u2026no way would I feel physically comfortable assisting someone else like that\u2026who is likely larger/heavier and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve never had any training in how to do it\n\nYour husband SHOULD have your back and tell MIl to line up respite care from an agency\u2026they are properly trained to give this kind of assistance \n\nAnd tell your husband\u2026.it\u2019s totally not about how lively his grandfather is, and you know he loves grandfather\u2026but you are not physically, mentally or emotionally capable of taking 24/7 care of him while parenting and taking on 100% of your own family\u2019s needs while he\u2019s working abroad. That for your grandfather\u2019s safety you are saying no.", "NTA. The boomer generation is..... some sort of something. We have boomer grandparents for our kids and its... special to say the least. I was supposed to have care for each of my kids during and after births and my mom backed out for one reason or another with each one. No, you do not need to be providing SHOWERS to an elderly man. Besides it's gross, you have 3 kids to care for and what if one or both of you slips and falls? Besides being an insane ask, it's also dangerous.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t stuck. Say no and stick to it. Tell hubby if he wants to do it, he can take the time off", "I'd plan to leave town for at least first 3 days that she goes on vacation and get all of it in writing that your not going to be responsible for him during this time. \n\nOP you need a solid legal plan in place.", "I think they are suggesting MIL take him on the train with her and then she flies out from the nearest airport (instead of the one near her house).", "I think OP was suggesting MIL accompany her father by train to where OP lives, and then takes a plane from there on out :)", "Seriously I'd tell him to do both and f off for a 3 week vacation for yourself\n\nLet him see how astronomically insane that is that he asks that for you.", "Some places have 24 hour respite care.

I hear she bailed on you when she said she would help you. I hear you are overwhelmed with your own life and feel this is a great imposition because your MIL is mean. And i hear you believe your husband's grandfather should be shoved in a room and left alone to wait to die.\n\nWhat I don't hear is any thoughts of the Grandfather, he is your husbands grandfather right? Has he mistreated you? shunned you? discarded you?\n\nIf your husband doesn't feel he is safe alone with a 3x a week carer maybe see if the carer can come to your house 3x a week to help with showers and such. Maybe call the company that offers him this service they may be able to offer in home assistance.\n\nBut you do you, just seems like a lot of anger toward the MIL is being directed at the grandfather.", "ESH - you are not owed child care, especially when your MIL is caring for someone else already. Caring for people is exhausting, and yeah she damn well deserves a break. Mind you she is also setting up a place to be rented out, that does take work. \nShe really should have asked you both first, and she is ignoring boundaries that you have set. But honestly if you don\u2019t help you are an AH. The father is not to blame and to be him at risk is not ok. \nYou sound bitter she couldn\u2019t help you, it sounds like you won\u2019t help just because she didn\u2019t give childcare.", "Your MIL has been taking care of her father for a long time. No wonder she didn't want to babysit your kids on top of that. It's too much.\n\nBut you're NTA. Sure, MIL needs the weeks off, but why didn't she make arrangements for her father? You have 3 kids you're taking care of alone - no way should you take on an 85 y/o who needs so much care. That's too much for you.\n\nTell MIL & DH no & they need to find another solution.", "DO NOT DO IT. I\u2019m begging you not to do it. Who cares what anyone else thinks?", "NTA. Tell your hubs that grandpa is lovely, but you just don\u2019t have the spoons to take that on right now. \n\nIt has nothing to do with MIL being a selfish cow. It has nothing to do with her past refusal to help with the kids. It\u2019s not about grandpa not being a nice person because it sounds like he is. It\u2019s about you not being able to take on any more responsibilities right now on top of what you already have. \n\nIf your husband wants to take that on as he always does he\u2019s more than welcome to. But you\u2019re owning up to what is and isn\u2019t within your abilities right now which is safer and healthier for EVERYONE involved including his grandfather.", "If your husband feels so strongly about it he should stay home and do it himself. This is not fair to you. \n\nYour MIL sounds like a selfish nightmare. I\u2019d stop speaking to her if at possible", "NTA. In general I'm a big believer in helping family, but there has to be both a good relationship and reciprocity for that to happen. I do feel bad for the grandfather here, but the only way MIL will ever learn she can't get away with this is for people to stop enabling her behavior.", "You cantt be taken advantage of without your permission. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have plenty of responsibility to handle on your own without your husband there. It honestly sounds like you couldn't handle his grandfather in addition, even if you wanted to.\n\nShe needs to line up actual care or put him in a facility geared towards his needs. If she goes without proper care, she is committing elder neglect.", "NTA please don't do it, if anything goes wrong you will be blamed. God forbid one of children is ill and you have grandfather too it will be too much. She HAS to pay for a carer or put him in a home.", "NTA Your husband needs to understand that it is impossible to care for grandpa, three children and everything else you are responsible for . If he were here, then maybe together you could pull it off but no way can you do this alone.  It's time for him to stand up and tell his mother it's HER job to handle this.

I bet he wouldn't last one day looking after 3 kids and grandfather,  does he think you just sit around all day?", "He is getting upset at the wrong person, tell him to find his spine and talk to his mother.", "No, it\u2019s both.", "Entitled people remain entitled because those around them let them. If DH won't put proper boundaries in place, it's not OP's problem.", "It can take a while to open a home that isn't in use for much of the year, roughly two days to clean and air the place out, and then 3.5 weeks to relax while your daughter in law looks after the parent you receive money to look after (and her own kids)\n\nVery time consuming.", "NTA. Stand your ground and continue refusing to take on the extra responsibility. Let MIL make other arrangements. If she chooses to leave her patient (aka her father) without appropriate care, immediately report that to authorities, but DO NOT allow yourself to be pressured or bullied.", "NTA.\n\nYou are essentially a single parent. You have three kids in school. You can\u2019t provide care to an additional adult 7 hours away, and moving him to you sounds like it\u2019s a serious medical risk and cruelty for a man in frail health with dementia. \n\nHe needs a full time carer in HIS OWN HOME. She can pay for a professional full time care-giver. Her wanting to move him in his state for three weeks then back is disgusting.", "NTA and not your responsibility", "Not sure if anyone has mentioned it but look into respite care for the time mil is away. A carers responsibility depends on the individual needs of the person receiving care so its not as cut and dried as you'd hope for.", "Sadly they often refuse point blank to talk to anyone other than the individual who needs care or to their registered next of kin/registered carer. I used to work in care, am now in need of daily care myself and tried speaking to someone at adult social care about my parents needing support. Made it very clear I didn't want any information from them but that my parents needs were changing and they needed to be revisited by a SW. They said unless my parents rang them directly themselves they wouldn't even do a welfare check. I explained that my mum had diminishing capacity and my dad wasn't able to contact them himself due to cognitive issues and they still refused. Was a huge battle to get anyone to check on them. Now trying to sort POA and legal next of kin stuff but it's an uphill fight all the way. I swear when I worked in care myself a decade ago its was a lot simpler but maybe it depends on which council your under?!", "Ah mate that sucks! Norfolk cc made it so hard for me to get help but south Norfolk cc have been so helpful along with CAB. (MH and other things) the postcode lottery is madness!", "NTA", "NTA. Tell her NO. Set some boundaries with everyone!! God forbid you get hurt. Or maybe you should fake getting hurt. Can't take care of him than.", "Um, notify the authorities if anything does happen to him.
