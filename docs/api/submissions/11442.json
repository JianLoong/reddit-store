She has an \u201cfamily\u201d apartment abroad where she goes there for 3-4 weeks in may to open up, and 3-4 weeks in September to close it down. She usually books these holidays without consulting and of her family and then expects people to swap and change their plans to care for the grandparent. Usually this entails DH driving 7 hours each way to collect grandparent along with 2 cats. We have suggested it maybe easier to deliver him to us on the train and then fly from an airport close to us. \n\nJust to add some more info, my husband and I are not allowed to go to the apartment in the summer holidays as she rents it out to other people, however keeps insisting it is a family apartment. \n\nHowever for the past 6 months DH has moved abroad for work and rarely gets to come home. He has already has a conversation with his mother about trying to liaise with us before she books another holiday, so that the grandparent is safe and looked after.

She should absolutely pay for respite care for him. Having someone come him three times a week isn't enough in those circumstances.  Plus, having you take care of him while trying to manage your children isn't a good option either.  \n\nPerhaps you and your husband can ask her about paying for full-time care while she's gone.

Tell your MIL with your current responsibilities and your husband being away it would be negligent of her to leave him with you as you cannot care for him properly.

His health reasons alone are enough: Dementia, strokes, insulin, depression, falling in the night. This isn\u2019t just taking care of an elderly family member, this requires around the clock care. Add to that your MIL\u2019s refusal to help you and your husband, which I\u2019m only adding because she expects her family to drop everything at anytime to care for her father for weeks, but refuses to help/watch her grandchildren for one overnight. You cannot be expected to take this on with 3 children, and your husband shouldn\u2019t expect that of you either. IMO that is unfair and unrealistic. MIL needs to make the proper arrangements for his care if she is not willing to have him placed in a permanent facility.", "NTA, not at all. You have more than enough on your plate already, and caring for granddad is not in your wheelhouse. MIL was told DH was away, yet she booked this trip anyway without consulting anyone about granddad's care.\n\nWith any luck, this might be the wake-up call your MIL needs to get her head out of her posterior and learn to communicate and arrange for care prior to booking a trip.

To take care of your grandfather-in-law is to neglect what you and your children need while he's there.

The consequence of *her* action is that *she* needs to find *appropriate and safe* care for her own father while she is away. *I* am not that care because I don't have the time to give him the attention that he needs and I *refuse* to be responsible if something happens because I'm already busy looking after *our children and home* while you aren't here.\"", "I don't have any good advice of what to do unfortunately. \n\nBut Certainly NTA for not wanting to take on the additional responsibility of an 85 year old grandparent under those conditions when you have three children to worry about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She doesn't make that money so she can go on trips, she makes it so he'll be cared for.\nAs someone who's done it  in the past, caring for someone with those kind of needs can be hard on you, especially if it isn't a job and it's around the clock care. I think your husband needs to work on setting boundaries with his mother because no part of this on her end is responsible behavior.
