I wouldn't want to be friends with someone with the gumption to actually *get offended* that I took my first day off in forever.\n\nYou're not allowed to be any happier than she is? What's that?", "NTA no need to tiptoe around people. If she asks where you\u2019ve been would she expect you to lie or what? You say you\u2019ve sent her money in the past\u2026 maybe she\u2019s just dropping hints that she wants more.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you are asshole and I don\u2019t necessarily think she\u2019s has NPD. I think she\u2019s jealous and angry at herself for so many reasons. You doing the things she probably knows she needs to do angers her because she\u2019s jealous.", "NTA. Maybe you just aren't compatible as adult friends. There is nothing wrong with terminating a long term relationship because you've grown and don't see things the same. Maybe try having a conversation with her about this, and if she is not open to sharing her feelings about this, then maybe it's time to leave this friendship in the past.", "NTA. You have been making \"mature\" decisions all along while she has not. It sounds as if you may have outgrown this friendship. Just a note of unsolicited advice from someone who has been there: those 60-hour weeks with no downtime may come at a cost to your mental health and ability to form and sustain meaningful relationships and activities outside of work. I'm not saying don't do it - just be mindful about it.", "NTA. Your taking a day off and not rubbing your wealth in her face. However, you have obviously outgrown your friendship, if this is your level of communication", "I feel your pain OP.  This last year I lost a friendship over this.  I never rubbed the fact that I have money in her face, NEVER.  On the minimum, my friend would say something referring to how much money I have.  I would just ignore the statements.  But when she went off the handle one day and called off the friendship, I was blown away.  I talked to my adult son about it and told him what happen, word for word.  He said \u201cmom, it really sounds like she is the one that has resentment  because you have money and she doesn\u2019t.  This is not on you mom.  \u201c. \n\nI have reached out to her multiple times with her having no interest in rekindling the relationship.  Guess this is just how it is.   So unfortunate.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You need to take a step back from this false friendship. Emotionally and financially. You are not responsible for her irresponsibility! It\u2019s time to let life get in the way and let this friendship go. A friend is supposed to support you and lift you up. Not crap on you for daring to take a day off to enjoy yourself", "Nta. You're entitled to enjoy the money you have earned. Now you know how she feels, just keep that part of your life away from her.", "NTA, I had a friend like her, key word being Had.  \nI make more than some of my friends and a some make more than me.  \nNone of us are better or worse than the others for that, hence why they are still my friends.", "NTA. She doesn't sound like a good friend", "NTA - she is not a real friend, or she would be happy for you to do something for yourself.  Time to move on from this friendship.", "NTA.\n\nI have a SIL like this, but worse.  Hasn't worked a real job in decades, managed to get on disability for \"migraines\" and yet accuses my wife (who put herself through school and works long hours) of \"rubbing her success in her face\" by even mentioning a trip or a purchase.  All the while very comfortable with us paying for their dinner or even plane tickets.\n\nJust let the complaints fall on deaf ears, and cut them out of your life to the extent necessary to be able to enjoy the fruits of your own labor.", "NTA. If you\u2019re unable to talk to her about good things that happen in your life she is not your friend. If she is happy to hear about when you are struggling she is not your friend. It sucks to say this but it sounds like she is focused on the negatives in her life and may be stuck in a victim mindset. She could be in denial that her own actions contributed to her situation. She may have good intentions with your friendship and care for you but she is not acting out the role of a good friend. I personally am in a very difficult financial situation caused by my physical disability but I never do this to my best friend who is very successful and travels a lot. There\u2019s no good reason for me to drag her down, it wouldn\u2019t make me or her feel good or even help either of us in any way.", "NTA and she is not your friend... Friendship is a 2 way street and, when you care about somebody, their success makes you happy and proud not envious and jealous...\n\nI would seriously suggest distancing yourself from this person.", "NTA. Your friend would have gotten on my nerves too. If you tell me you're taking a day to go to a spa, all I can say back is, \"Sounds like fun. Have a good time.\"\n\nWhat is it with adults who behave like they have no experience with behaving like grownups? Someone else's spa day isn't about me and it is no reflection of MY finances or status. Sometimes its easy to feel that someone else is luckier and has greater wherewithal than you. But, time and chance happen to everyone. Nothing to feel insecure or jealous about IMO because someone else has or does what I covet.\n\nAnd then to blame your for her feelings of jealousy and disadvantage? Its just too childish for me. So, ask her out loud: What are we allowed to talk about? Make a list so I can study it and perform like a seal in the circus to your expectations, maybe?", "NTA, she cannot handle money and you can, that is her problem. This being said, you probably are only hurting yourself (mentl well being) by hanging out with her.", "NTA, for sure.  Sounds to me like she is taking advantage of you, and your friendship.  If you don\u2019t feel able and motivated to sit down with her and tell her how you really feel, it might be time to expand your circle of friends.", "NTA.  But\u2026 I do think if I was struggling and I had a friend who made good money, even if that money was justly earned through their hard work, I MIGHT feel a certain way if they said can\u2019t wait to take a day off and go to a spa (spas are obviously not cheap and it does say \u201cmoney\u201d without actually saying it). A more sensitive way to phrase it would be something like \u201cI can\u2019t wait to take a day off from work to relax and reset\u201d and then if she asked what you were doing, be truthful and say a spa day.  That\u2019s just a more sensitive way to do it, but it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole for not phrasing it that way. It sounds like you do deserve it and what\u2019s the point of working hard hard to make money if you can\u2019t treat yourself with it. So you shouldn\u2019t feel like an asshole, you just might not realize she feels sensitive about that subject.\n\nSounds like you both might have some resentment towards each other. \nAlthough your intentions may be pure, buying her essentials is enabling her. And even though she\u2019s willing to accept it and ask for more - she probably feels bad about herself and resents you for it - as backwards as it may be, there are people out there who resent help and it stems from jealousy and regret. She might wish she made the decisions you had because those decisions set you up for success.  Some people drown in insecurity and negativity and it holds them back from making positive changes for the future.", "NTA\n\n Your friend is an energy vampire", "NTA. She is addicted to the attention she gets from always having a problem. You can't make someone change. They have to want it themselves. She is unfairly comparing her life to yours and throwing that in your face. That is toxic and draining behavior. A real friend would be happy you get to do something nice for yourself. You may have to step away from this friendship since it seems quite one-sided.", "Your life doesn't stop because hers is a train wreck. You are being gaslighted.", "People who are permanentely envious and don't see what life has for them are annoying.", "NTA\n\nEhhhh people like this want you to be on the same level as them so you not being stressed makes her feel inferior", "NTA for going to the spa - obviously.  However, if we're being honest, it seems like you do begrudge her past and current spending since you brought it up.  Most of your post seems to be pointing out your 'friend's' flaws which aren't relevant to your right to spend your money as you wish.  It's probably time to transition from friends to acquaintances since your interactions seem to leave both of you feeling negative.", "NTA she sounds like a narcissist", "So your going to the spa is \"rubbing your wealth into her face,\" but she doesn't have a problem asking you for money or having you buy groceries for her.\n\n\nThere is no logic. She sounds exhausting. Time to let this friendship wither and die.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. She\u2019s just jealous you\u2019re doing better than her and clearly have your priorities straight", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re friends though. She calls you privileged for anything you do and you clearly disapprove of her priorities.", "NTA\n\nTake some distance. Let's be clear: a spa day is not flaunting wealth unless you do it like weekly! \n\nIt also sounds clear that she was happy to spend her money and \"flaunt it\" in front of you while you were in school etc. \n\nAnyhow I would probably tell her you are going to take some space bc her attitude is hypocritical and unsupportive and you just don't need to feel like your hard work and stability is something to be ashamed of.", "NTA - sounds like you\u2019re an example of what can be accomplished in life. People don\u2019t like to struggle and she\u2019s unfairly taking it out on you.", "NTA. She isn't truly your friend, sadly.", "I think your friendship ran it's course years ago and you've been clinging to the scraps.  When was the last time she did a single nice or thoughtful thing for you?  Was she even grateful for the money you've sent her?   I doubt it.\n\nNTA but only for now.  If you're complaining about this same dynamic in a few months than it's just your fault for not moving on from the friendship.   I know it hurts.", "THIS is how I lost my friend of 20+years. We grow apart. You HAVE to surround yourself with people who compliment your life not drag it/you down. Friends grow together, share, learn and thrive on each others success.\nYour friend is sadly not on the same page.\nNTA", "I'm not sure whether she's a narcissist, but you're definitely NTA. Life isn't always perfectly even and fair in terms of successes and failures. If your friend can't accept that and be happy for the little ways you're able to care and provide for yourself, she doesn't sound like a very good friend. Maybe she needs some distance to work out her own insecurities and frustrations with life, and in that case you could have a conversation about steering clear of certain topics for a few months; it depends upon how much you want to save this friendship. But never being able to talk about those things/policing yourself about mentioning getting Starbucks feels unreasonable. It doesn't sound like you're constantly throwing these things in her face.", "NTA. You were excited about a spa day and you shared that. She sounds like she resents you for it and is upset about her own situation. I wouldn\u2019t take it personally. Hurt ppl sometimes take it out on someone else, not saying it\u2019s right.\n\nIt\u2019s a freaking spa day not a new Ferrari. What freaking wealth are you showing off lol? Weird", "NTA. Jealousy is an ugly thing. Distance provides a lot of clarity.", "NTA and you may be her friend but she clearly isn't yours and reminds me of some friends I used to have who only kept me around to make themselves feel better because I was poorer/ otherwise worse off than them. I'm not saying you need to cut her out, but this is definitely a sign to take a step back and take a look at your relationship with her over the years.", "NTA - I, an internet stranger, give you permission to end this friendship and leave room in your life for more fulfilling friendships.  My 15 yo gave me some of the best advice I have ever gotten about friendships.  She said \"I pay attention to how I feel when I am done hanging out with them.  Do I feel better than before hanging out or worse.  If it is worse, I stop hanging out with them.\"  Once you strip away the length of the friendship, how you know them, etc and focus on this simple \"test\" you will know whether or not to continue to have contact.  It has worked well for me for over a year.", "NTA.  The big guest \u201cprivilege\u201d is not working much. \n\nTell her that you won\u2019t listen to these comments anymore.  She is choosing free time over working more.  You are choosing working more and supporting yourself.", "I don't know what she is, I only know what she isn't: a good friend.

If I were you I'd leave this toxic, one-sided \"friendship\" behind.\n\nNTA.", "NTA lmao \"wealth\" \ud83d\ude02", "You're NTA, but honestly, you need to call time on this relationship. People who attract gloom and doom should be avoided, as that spirit of negativity will end up effecting you adversely. You do not want to be shamed for enjoying the fruits of a life you worked hard to achieve.", "NTA, she doesn\u2019t want you to be her friends she wants a therapist and enabler.", "NTA - She's just having a rough time. I'm sure you didn't mean any harm towards her. Also, wealth is a complicated matter, and your wealth is none of her business.", "Esh sounds like you two really shouldn\u2019t be friends, both of you shouldn\u2019t be speaking about each other the way you are.", "Your friend sounds exhausting, IMO. And it was a spa day not a private jet lol. NTA. You recognized that you needed me time and you made it happen. Good job!", "NAH\n\nShe's having a rough time of things and seems to be projecting, somewhat. She's obviously struggling, for whatever reason, with more 'adult' responsibilities. It could be entirely her own fault, It might not (E.g. people with ADHD tend to be impulsive and poor at money management time management etc). She's upset because hearing of your achievements makes her more aware of her own shortcomings. \n\nYou also shouldn't feel bad for your own achievements. After working so hard and being responsible you are now able to treat yourself and that's OK. Talk to your friend, try and explain how you feel. Make sure she's aware that you're not mentioning these things to make her feel bad or somehow rub her nose it, but because you're proud of your personal achievements and want to share that with her.", "NTA but it's good to be aware about the financial status of others and sensitive to that in conversation.  Maybe your friends who are struggling aren't the best ones to share your excitement about a spa trip with. Just etiquette. Now that you have some well deserved security and slack, that's a new thing to add to your \"how to be a kind person\" bucket.", "NTA, but why are you friends with such a selfish person?", "She sucks out of anything good from you. Cut the loss. That's an emotional black hole. Just agree with her that you are privileged. So what.

You for continuing to try and force a functional relationship with someone who continues to make clear they are neither proud of you nor supportive of you. This isnt the friend you think she is.
