{"id": 2998, "submission_id": "z24r68", "title": "AITA for setting restrictions on my sister's foster kid visiting over Christmas?", "selftext": "I am a mother of 2 teenagers (14m and 17f). My sister and her partner don't have biological children but they have had several foster children. She currently has 1 foster son who has been with her for over a year. He is 16. \n\nMy husband and I usually host at Christmas. We have space and I enjoy doing it. My host on Christmas day and NYE. As well as my sister and her partner, I have 1 brother,  and my husband has a sister. Both have families, my children's cousins are adults now but still attend. My husband's parents also usually attend. \n\nMy sister doesn't want to attend if her foster son isn't invited. Of course I understand that. I realise that it doesn't sound good but I find him challenging. He has unmedicated ADHD and he has a lot of behavioural problems. He has been in young offenders units and he had to go to special schools because no one could deal with him. I don't think he intentionally acts out but he can never sit still and he starts getting up and walking around or climbing on things. I realise he can't control his impulses as well as other people can but he is almost an adult so my patience has a limit. He also swears constantly and even though he apologises after he keeps doing it. \n\nHe wasn't at Christmas last year because he had a mental health crisis but he is apparently doing well now and my sister wants him to come. If he is going to come I'd prefer it was for a limited time because he makes things more stressful for me and my kids are most definitely influenced by his behaviour. Both start to talk like him when they spend time with him. They both idolise him because they think he's cool. \n\nI suggested limitations to my sister. For example I said I'd rather he wasn't there for a main meal because he can't even sit through a short lunch. I also said I wanted him to leave before any alcohol was available because I don't trust him around it and I don't want him going out and vaping constantly. Honestly I would prefer he came for 1 - 2 hours and went home. I can't relax while he's there and most of the other adults feel the same. \n\nMy sister said I was cruel for suggesting this. She said her foster kid had never had a nice Christmas because he has been in care for a long time and she said he is sensitive to people rejecting him. Apparently he is trying very hard to be calm at family gatherings and she thinks he has been doing well. My husband agrees but he thinks I shouldn't have said anything and just tried to manage over Christmas. My brother and his wife think something similar. I haven't spoken to anyone else. \n\nMy sister is angry but as far as I know she still intends to come for Christmas. I'm not sure what to do next. I don't want to be unfair to her foster kid because I know he's had a hard life and he is probably doing his best.", "created_utc": 1669150576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z24r68/aita_for_setting_restrictions_on_my_sisters/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And honestly if your kids start acting out after being around him for a few hours, that\u2019s a you problem.

Think about what kind of boundaries you might need to be comfortable with his presence.   If there is some behavior that you see as \"time out/ cool down in another part of the house worthy.\"  Perhaps have a plan with your sister for how he can leave the table early if he just can't sit still any longer.  Where he will go and who will accompany him.  Having clear action plans with your sister should ease some of your anxiety and dismay over the situation.   Ask her for her input and suggestions for how the evening can be best navigated.  Hopefully she is open to this.  If she is not, do your own research.

My sister and her partner don't have biological children but they have had several foster children. She currently has 1 foster son who has been with her for over a year. He is 16. \n\nMy husband and I usually host at Christmas. We have space and I enjoy doing it. My host on Christmas day and NYE. As well as my sister and her partner, I have 1 brother,  and my husband has a sister. Both have families, my children's cousins are adults now but still attend. My husband's parents also usually attend. \n\nMy sister doesn't want to attend if her foster son isn't invited. Of course I understand that. I realise that it doesn't sound good but I find him challenging. He has unmedicated ADHD and he has a lot of behavioural problems. He has been in young offenders units and he had to go to special schools because no one could deal with him. I don't think he intentionally acts out but he can never sit still and he starts getting up and walking around or climbing on things. I realise he can't control his impulses as well as other people can but he is almost an adult so my patience has a limit. He also swears constantly and even though he apologises after he keeps doing it. \n\nHe wasn't at Christmas last year because he had a mental health crisis but he is apparently doing well now and my sister wants him to come. If he is going to come I'd prefer it was for a limited time because he makes things more stressful for me and my kids are most definitely influenced by his behaviour. Both start to talk like him when they spend time with him. They both idolise him because they think he's cool. \n\nI suggested limitations to my sister. For example I said I'd rather he wasn't there for a main meal because he can't even sit through a short lunch. I also said I wanted him to leave before any alcohol was available because I don't trust him around it and I don't want him going out and vaping constantly. Honestly I would prefer he came for 1 - 2 hours and went home. I can't relax while he's there and most of the other adults feel the same. \n\nMy sister said I was cruel for suggesting this. She said her foster kid had never had a nice Christmas because he has been in care for a long time and she said he is sensitive to people rejecting him. Apparently he is trying very hard to be calm at family gatherings and she thinks he has been doing well. My husband agrees but he thinks I shouldn't have said anything and just tried to manage over Christmas. My brother and his wife think something similar. I haven't spoken to anyone else. \n\nMy sister is angry but as far as I know she still intends to come for Christmas. I'm not sure what to do next. I don't want to be unfair to her foster kid because I know he's had a hard life and he is probably doing his best.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nWhy don\u2019t you ask your sister what he likes to do. \n\nSet up a table in the living room for him to do it. You could provide puzzles or he could bring a gaming system and you could help him hook it up to your tv. Tell him if he\u2019s uncomfortable sitting, he can go into that room and use the a to it\u2019s quietly until he\u2019s ready to join you.", "You have more than a month. Talk to your sister and set up some short visits with fewer people. Do single meals, you make one or two, have her bring one or two. Yes this will take some effort, but your sister and probably the kid will appreciate your efforts. That will lower the tension about visiting at Christmas with more people and higher stakes. This might be a win-win for everyone. Otherwise it sounds like you, or your sister, or the kid, and probably more than one of you will end up regretting or resenting what happens.", "Have you asked your sister what sets him up for success? Most disorders are milder in the morning, lighten with fresh air and light. Could the most chaotic part of the day - present opening - be first thing Christmas morning? If you live in a warm enough climate, could the big meal be lunch on the porch? Then wrap up the big festivities with different groups going in different directions for different activities. Sister can take him home if it\u2019s not going well.", "YTA you have preconceived notions. This young man needs to feel welcomed. Open your mind and maybe your heart.", "Oof. This sucks! I have a feeling this isn\u2019t going to work because you have a sister relationship and I have a feeling this is getting in the way. Can you try again to talk to your sister about creating a Xmas family activity that works *with* this child\u2019s needs in mind? At the very least, consider chunking up the day so that there are natural parts where the kid can bow out with the family and still be a participant in some part of the day. But if the two of you just can\u2019t work together like that then you need to suck it up and have him there. Ignore the vaping. Do not ignore serious anti-social behavior. But you\u2019ll have to figure out a way to gracefully manage things. Don\u2019t have so much alcohol. Consider having a space he can go and play video games if he likes. I don\u2019t know. It sounds like your sister feels he can handle it and maybe wants to show off that he can but both of you would be doing a mitzvah to try to make the day easier for him and all of you.", "You are awful. I read your comments it doesn\u2019t help you at all and obviously YTA", "YTA. All you're succeeding in doing is making that kid WHO YOU KNOW HAS HAD A ROUGH LIFE get rejected yet again because 'he's not perfect'. Not only has he been thrown around foster homes, he has ADHD which is challenging on its own. The fact that he apologizes after swearing means that he's not doing it to purposely annoy anyone, and your kids probably start to talk like him without intention. You 'don't want to be unfair' yet you are literally excluding him from a family gathering because he isn't good enough to be in your house for a day. Also, I'm so happy he now has a foster mother who loves and stands up for him. And you could certainly learn from her.", "Yta- what are we celebrating at Christmas again?", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA, literally the story tells it self", "Soft YTA please go back and apologise to your sister. Then visit or do a video call with her family, ask the boy what he would like for Christmas, if he has any favourite festive foods or snacks that you could include. \nGet him involved somehow, does he like music - he can make a Christmas playlist of quirky covers, movies- choose a movie to watch with the younger kids, would he like to help in the kitchen or clearing the table - he can get up and down all the time then to fetch stuff so it\u2019s not against the rules (like just randomly wandering off) and spend time with the grown ups more? (Less of a worry with swearing) The more engaged he is the less he will act up, adhd is exacerbated by stress and worry about not fitting in, and boredom.\nIf he knows you are pleased to include him you are likely to have a better experience, and this could be the Christmas he loves best, when he finally felt you just understood him. \nClassic board games that he knows in advance, charades (active game good for quick minds) multiplayer sports games on a switch, all these things are your friends.\nI get you are worried and at your wits end trying to understand how it is all going to go.

He needs you. \n\nYou can still set limits.  Provide a \"time out\" space, not the punishment kind but a place he can retreat to when he needs a break.

Just give him a hug and a thank you before he leaves.", "YTA\n\nWhat does it matter to you if he had to get up and walk around sometimes. You have that much of a need to control people and the situation?", "From a former foster kid; you are an Massive Asshole. I have experienced people like you. I have several choice words for you unprintable words here. Every worst insults in 3 different languages I know I will hurl to you. You should grow yourself some empathy. That kid went through trauma equivalent to a actual combat vet. That why most of us foster kid can talk and joke with vets for we understand each other painfully well.. Trauma changes people. That behavior that kid showed is actually the SYMPTOMS of trauma . You are full of shit and YTA all the way and I can think of other names to call you OP\n\nBefore you ask; I spent 14 years in the system; I earn 3 figures, own a home and I have traveled and did all the stuff an successful person do. I also have a disability; ADHD; several other letters as well.", "YTA. OP, reasonable accommodation would be to have your sister talk to him about not swearing, and to have him vape far enough from the house that the younger kids can't see him. I'd also recommend getting fidgets for THE WHOLE table, which might help him stay sitting longer, and might even help the younger ones. My son gets to play with fidgets in therapy, and I always do too. They're strangely calming. Also, talk to your kids and explain that although he swears, you don't allow that in your house. I have YOUNG kids who have school-aged friends who swear, and they know better than to swear. As a parent, you know, you have to TEACH your kids.\n\nYOUR suggestions seem cruel. And they most certainly will make this kid feel unwanted and like he doesn't belong.", "YTA. Here\u2019s the thing, he\u2019s used to be pushing away by everyone. You saying/acting as you are just confirms it to him. Start working with your sister to help him through Xmas. Ask him what he needs, set limits/consequences for poor behaviour. Foster Care is necessary because of trauma. If he\u2019s been in care for a long time? It\u2019s even worse. Also just because he\u2019s a young offender does not mean he doesn\u2019t have value. He does. Show him he does.", "INFO: I'm aware this might be personal, so only answer if comfortable. But how come he isn't medicated for his ADHD if it affects him this way? Or does he not feel the need to?\n\nI'm mostly wondering because my SO comes home from work sometimes quite exhausted because his coworker hasn't gotten his prescription refilled (also ADHD) and his state of mind then gets very tiring when trying to work while keeping up with his thought process etc. He (coworker) said that he doesn't really care how he gets, because he doesn't notice it himself.", "YTA.

This smells of if something/someone can't micromanage everyone and everything at all times and literally cannot conform to my unrealistic standards then they're not worth the time of day.", "YTA. \nEverybody deserves kindness and respect.", "You might actually do some research on ADHD yourself and learn what his experience is like. \n\nYour sister sounds like she is doing incredible work with him. You could learn a lot from her.", "Yta I think you are missing the point of Christmas. Love people when it\u2019s hard for you cause those are the people it makes the biggest difference too.", "YTA. You treat family with mental health issues with love and care, not rejection. He is a kid and he has probably been through some shit that would make you go off your rocker too. Let him come and teach your kids how to be compassionate adults.", "YTA. Agree with so many other comments here. I mean, you complain that he doesn't sit still as if sitting still is a required element of the holidays. How about planning some activities that would suit his needs?
