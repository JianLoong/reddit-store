{"id": 2998, "submission_id": "z24r68", "title": "AITA for setting restrictions on my sister's foster kid visiting over Christmas?", "selftext": "I am a mother of 2 teenagers (14m and 17f). My sister and her partner don't have biological children but they have had several foster children. She currently has 1 foster son who has been with her for over a year. He is 16. \n\nMy husband and I usually host at Christmas. We have space and I enjoy doing it. My host on Christmas day and NYE. As well as my sister and her partner, I have 1 brother,  and my husband has a sister. Both have families, my children's cousins are adults now but still attend. My husband's parents also usually attend. \n\nMy sister doesn't want to attend if her foster son isn't invited. Of course I understand that. I realise that it doesn't sound good but I find him challenging. He has unmedicated ADHD and he has a lot of behavioural problems. He has been in young offenders units and he had to go to special schools because no one could deal with him. I don't think he intentionally acts out but he can never sit still and he starts getting up and walking around or climbing on things. I realise he can't control his impulses as well as other people can but he is almost an adult so my patience has a limit. He also swears constantly and even though he apologises after he keeps doing it. \n\nHe wasn't at Christmas last year because he had a mental health crisis but he is apparently doing well now and my sister wants him to come. If he is going to come I'd prefer it was for a limited time because he makes things more stressful for me and my kids are most definitely influenced by his behaviour. Both start to talk like him when they spend time with him. They both idolise him because they think he's cool. \n\nI suggested limitations to my sister. For example I said I'd rather he wasn't there for a main meal because he can't even sit through a short lunch. I also said I wanted him to leave before any alcohol was available because I don't trust him around it and I don't want him going out and vaping constantly. Honestly I would prefer he came for 1 - 2 hours and went home. I can't relax while he's there and most of the other adults feel the same. \n\nMy sister said I was cruel for suggesting this. She said her foster kid had never had a nice Christmas because he has been in care for a long time and she said he is sensitive to people rejecting him. Apparently he is trying very hard to be calm at family gatherings and she thinks he has been doing well. My husband agrees but he thinks I shouldn't have said anything and just tried to manage over Christmas. My brother and his wife think something similar. I haven't spoken to anyone else. \n\nMy sister is angry but as far as I know she still intends to come for Christmas. I'm not sure what to do next. I don't want to be unfair to her foster kid because I know he's had a hard life and he is probably doing his best.", "created_utc": 1669150576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z24r68/aita_for_setting_restrictions_on_my_sisters/", "score": 1335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And honestly if your kids start acting out after being around him for a few hours, that\u2019s a you problem.

Sister would be a good choice, so if foster kid gets overwhelmed he can retreat up to his room, and if there's any furniture that will get climbed on, it will be her own.

Think about what kind of boundaries you might need to be comfortable with his presence.   If there is some behavior that you see as \"time out/ cool down in another part of the house worthy.\"  Perhaps have a plan with your sister for how he can leave the table early if he just can't sit still any longer.  Where he will go and who will accompany him.  Having clear action plans with your sister should ease some of your anxiety and dismay over the situation.   Ask her for her input and suggestions for how the evening can be best navigated.  Hopefully she is open to this.  If she is not, do your own research.

My sister and her partner don't have biological children but they have had several foster children. She currently has 1 foster son who has been with her for over a year. He is 16. \n\nMy husband and I usually host at Christmas. We have space and I enjoy doing it. My host on Christmas day and NYE. As well as my sister and her partner, I have 1 brother,  and my husband has a sister. Both have families, my children's cousins are adults now but still attend. My husband's parents also usually attend. \n\nMy sister doesn't want to attend if her foster son isn't invited. Of course I understand that. I realise that it doesn't sound good but I find him challenging. He has unmedicated ADHD and he has a lot of behavioural problems. He has been in young offenders units and he had to go to special schools because no one could deal with him. I don't think he intentionally acts out but he can never sit still and he starts getting up and walking around or climbing on things. I realise he can't control his impulses as well as other people can but he is almost an adult so my patience has a limit. He also swears constantly and even though he apologises after he keeps doing it. \n\nHe wasn't at Christmas last year because he had a mental health crisis but he is apparently doing well now and my sister wants him to come. If he is going to come I'd prefer it was for a limited time because he makes things more stressful for me and my kids are most definitely influenced by his behaviour. Both start to talk like him when they spend time with him. They both idolise him because they think he's cool. \n\nI suggested limitations to my sister. For example I said I'd rather he wasn't there for a main meal because he can't even sit through a short lunch. I also said I wanted him to leave before any alcohol was available because I don't trust him around it and I don't want him going out and vaping constantly. Honestly I would prefer he came for 1 - 2 hours and went home. I can't relax while he's there and most of the other adults feel the same. \n\nMy sister said I was cruel for suggesting this. She said her foster kid had never had a nice Christmas because he has been in care for a long time and she said he is sensitive to people rejecting him. Apparently he is trying very hard to be calm at family gatherings and she thinks he has been doing well. My husband agrees but he thinks I shouldn't have said anything and just tried to manage over Christmas. My brother and his wife think something similar. I haven't spoken to anyone else. \n\nMy sister is angry but as far as I know she still intends to come for Christmas. I'm not sure what to do next. I don't want to be unfair to her foster kid because I know he's had a hard life and he is probably doing his best.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nWhy don\u2019t you ask your sister what he likes to do. \n\nSet up a table in the living room for him to do it. You could provide puzzles or he could bring a gaming system and you could help him hook it up to your tv. Tell him if he\u2019s uncomfortable sitting, he can go into that room and use the a to it\u2019s quietly until he\u2019s ready to join you.", "You have more than a month. Talk to your sister and set up some short visits with fewer people. Do single meals, you make one or two, have her bring one or two. Yes this will take some effort, but your sister and probably the kid will appreciate your efforts. That will lower the tension about visiting at Christmas with more people and higher stakes. This might be a win-win for everyone. Otherwise it sounds like you, or your sister, or the kid, and probably more than one of you will end up regretting or resenting what happens.", "Have you asked your sister what sets him up for success? Most disorders are milder in the morning, lighten with fresh air and light. Could the most chaotic part of the day - present opening - be first thing Christmas morning? If you live in a warm enough climate, could the big meal be lunch on the porch? Then wrap up the big festivities with different groups going in different directions for different activities. Sister can take him home if it\u2019s not going well.", "YTA you have preconceived notions. This young man needs to feel welcomed. Open your mind and maybe your heart.", "Oof. This sucks! I have a feeling this isn\u2019t going to work because you have a sister relationship and I have a feeling this is getting in the way. Can you try again to talk to your sister about creating a Xmas family activity that works *with* this child\u2019s needs in mind? At the very least, consider chunking up the day so that there are natural parts where the kid can bow out with the family and still be a participant in some part of the day. But if the two of you just can\u2019t work together like that then you need to suck it up and have him there. Ignore the vaping. Do not ignore serious anti-social behavior. But you\u2019ll have to figure out a way to gracefully manage things. Don\u2019t have so much alcohol. Consider having a space he can go and play video games if he likes. I don\u2019t know. It sounds like your sister feels he can handle it and maybe wants to show off that he can but both of you would be doing a mitzvah to try to make the day easier for him and all of you.", "You are awful. I read your comments it doesn\u2019t help you at all and obviously YTA", "YTA. All you're succeeding in doing is making that kid WHO YOU KNOW HAS HAD A ROUGH LIFE get rejected yet again because 'he's not perfect'. Not only has he been thrown around foster homes, he has ADHD which is challenging on its own. The fact that he apologizes after swearing means that he's not doing it to purposely annoy anyone, and your kids probably start to talk like him without intention. You 'don't want to be unfair' yet you are literally excluding him from a family gathering because he isn't good enough to be in your house for a day. Also, I'm so happy he now has a foster mother who loves and stands up for him. And you could certainly learn from her.", "Yta- what are we celebrating at Christmas again?", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA, literally the story tells it self", "Soft YTA please go back and apologise to your sister. Then visit or do a video call with her family, ask the boy what he would like for Christmas, if he has any favourite festive foods or snacks that you could include. \nGet him involved somehow, does he like music - he can make a Christmas playlist of quirky covers, movies- choose a movie to watch with the younger kids, would he like to help in the kitchen or clearing the table - he can get up and down all the time then to fetch stuff so it\u2019s not against the rules (like just randomly wandering off) and spend time with the grown ups more? (Less of a worry with swearing) The more engaged he is the less he will act up, adhd is exacerbated by stress and worry about not fitting in, and boredom.\nIf he knows you are pleased to include him you are likely to have a better experience, and this could be the Christmas he loves best, when he finally felt you just understood him. \nClassic board games that he knows in advance, charades (active game good for quick minds) multiplayer sports games on a switch, all these things are your friends.\nI get you are worried and at your wits end trying to understand how it is all going to go.

He needs you. \n\nYou can still set limits.  Provide a \"time out\" space, not the punishment kind but a place he can retreat to when he needs a break.

Just give him a hug and a thank you before he leaves.", "YTA\n\nWhat does it matter to you if he had to get up and walk around sometimes. You have that much of a need to control people and the situation?", "From a former foster kid; you are an Massive Asshole. I have experienced people like you. I have several choice words for you unprintable words here. Every worst insults in 3 different languages I know I will hurl to you. You should grow yourself some empathy. That kid went through trauma equivalent to a actual combat vet. That why most of us foster kid can talk and joke with vets for we understand each other painfully well.. Trauma changes people. That behavior that kid showed is actually the SYMPTOMS of trauma . You are full of shit and YTA all the way and I can think of other names to call you OP\n\nBefore you ask; I spent 14 years in the system; I earn 3 figures, own a home and I have traveled and did all the stuff an successful person do. I also have a disability; ADHD; several other letters as well.", "YTA. OP, reasonable accommodation would be to have your sister talk to him about not swearing, and to have him vape far enough from the house that the younger kids can't see him. I'd also recommend getting fidgets for THE WHOLE table, which might help him stay sitting longer, and might even help the younger ones. My son gets to play with fidgets in therapy, and I always do too. They're strangely calming. Also, talk to your kids and explain that although he swears, you don't allow that in your house. I have YOUNG kids who have school-aged friends who swear, and they know better than to swear. As a parent, you know, you have to TEACH your kids.\n\nYOUR suggestions seem cruel. And they most certainly will make this kid feel unwanted and like he doesn't belong.", "YTA. Here\u2019s the thing, he\u2019s used to be pushing away by everyone. You saying/acting as you are just confirms it to him. Start working with your sister to help him through Xmas. Ask him what he needs, set limits/consequences for poor behaviour. Foster Care is necessary because of trauma. If he\u2019s been in care for a long time? It\u2019s even worse. Also just because he\u2019s a young offender does not mean he doesn\u2019t have value. He does. Show him he does.", "INFO: I'm aware this might be personal, so only answer if comfortable. But how come he isn't medicated for his ADHD if it affects him this way? Or does he not feel the need to?\n\nI'm mostly wondering because my SO comes home from work sometimes quite exhausted because his coworker hasn't gotten his prescription refilled (also ADHD) and his state of mind then gets very tiring when trying to work while keeping up with his thought process etc. He (coworker) said that he doesn't really care how he gets, because he doesn't notice it himself.", "YTA.

This smells of if something/someone can't micromanage everyone and everything at all times and literally cannot conform to my unrealistic standards then they're not worth the time of day.", "YTA. \nEverybody deserves kindness and respect.", "You might actually do some research on ADHD yourself and learn what his experience is like. \n\nYour sister sounds like she is doing incredible work with him. You could learn a lot from her.", "Yta I think you are missing the point of Christmas. Love people when it\u2019s hard for you cause those are the people it makes the biggest difference too.", "YTA. You treat family with mental health issues with love and care, not rejection. He is a kid and he has probably been through some shit that would make you go off your rocker too. Let him come and teach your kids how to be compassionate adults.", "YTA. Agree with so many other comments here. I mean, you complain that he doesn't sit still as if sitting still is a required element of the holidays. How about planning some activities that would suit his needs?

CBD is non addictive, and doesnt actually get you high. \n\nthe swearing is another thing, its not strictly related to anything, but know its a lot easier to start doing something else than to stop doing something. try sitting down with him and his foster mum and discussing how he can try saying more child friendly versions instead, i also sometimes swear in other languages, my family finds it less offensive.\n\nmake sure to be clear that you arent mad at him, being a foster kid can be a horrible thing in and of itself, coupled with the anxiety his life must be so stressful. i hope if he doesnt spend christmas with you then he gets to spend a wonderful christmas with his foster family, it sounds like they really care about him", "Have some compassion, YTA.", "I feel like you are exaggerating his behavioral problems.

She is very difficult during holidays and milestone events, like birthdays, thanksgiving, and Christmas. Christmas being the worst. Over the years, my family has changed the structure of our Christmas to make it less draining on her. Your proposed method of limiting the amount of time he can celebrate with the family is not only alienating him, but also punishing him for having trauma. My sister did a stay at boys town. She didn't do a stay there because she was a juvenile delinquent, she did a stay there because there was no family willing to accept her before her previous foster parents. I don't know why your nephew stayed in a juvenile delinquency center, but I'm sure his unfortunate family circumstances fed into it . You are punishing your nephew for circumstances outside of his control. He acts out because of trauma. You know very well why he has a juvenile record, why he acts out, why holidays are hard for him. If you go through with your plan you will just be providing him with another dysfunctional holiday. \n\nIf you want other recommendations, here is what we do for my sister. Obviously not all kids are the same, but for your reference so you can know if she has similar circumstances to him, she had PANDAS disorder (resulting in parinoid schizophrenia) she still has delusions if grandure, parinoid, mania, as well as intellectual handicaps, ODD and misophonia. \n\nBecause of this, my family allows her to choose when she decides to eat with us but we will also let her eat alone if she chooses. She has a strenuous relationship with alcohol, but through explaining, honesty and years if her seeing alcohol being consumed safely she no longer gets weird around it.  She opens up her presents first then can choose if she wants to stay in the room when everyone else is opening presents. \n\nWhen she wants to be away from everyone, she is allowed to go to her own room. \n\nI would recommend setting up a quiet room maybe, a room that he can go to if he needs alone time. Even as a nuerotyoical person holidays are stressful and having a breather in your own space can help you stay sane. Please at least try to accommodate for this boy because he deserves it, he deserves st as biliry, normalcy, and to celebrate like any other kid. \n\nAs far as the alcohol, I recommend keeping the bottles in the main room in view of every one. That way it's not obvious you're worried he's going to steal it, but it is still in your view. Maybe communicate this worry to your sister so she can also look out for it.", "I'd say ESH.

He's her responsibility, not everyone elses. But I think you're being too callous about it. You should've talked to her before you decided to put these restrictions and worked it through with her first.\n\nYou could've invited him for the whole thing but told your sister that he has to stay by her side the moment he starts climbing on stuff and then leave if he gets worse.

Do you know what he's been through, your sister has been his foster mom for a over a year and and it seems you care nothing about him except he's had issues and is \"unmedicated\". \n\nYou need to really dig down deep and remember what Christmas is supposed to represent and open your heart.", "YTA. Reading this hurt my heart. The child is family. I can\u2019t imagine excluding a child \u2026 especially at Christmas. \nI hope they never find out that you wanted to exclude them.

Come up with a game plan.", "YTA. OMG, YTA. You told your sister to leave her foster child home during Christmas dinner. Even if he had a perfect childhood in every way possible, it would still hurt his feelings to eat alone while his foster family all ate together.

It\u2019s on you to set expectations with swearing around your children, not your sister. \n\nI would read up on ADHD because your post reads of very little understanding or empathy. Putting more pressure on him to perform a certain way will increase his anxiety and make it harder ten fold for him to actually do what you want.

But why the fuck is he unmedicated? If he simply refuses to take the medicine, which makes life intentionally harder for himself and everyone around him... Then he is TA and you are not. But if it's because this is in the US and the medicine is too expensive then NOITA. I wholeheartedly agree we should be more accepting of neurodivergent people, but us neurodivergent people should also do everything we can to be as comfortable to be around as possible. No one likes to be around someone who can go on a rampage at any minute.   \n\n\nMy full judgement HEAVILY relies on why he isn't medicated... If he doesn't want to take it... NTA... If they can't afford the medicine... YTA", "My question is.. if these behaviours are diagnosed.. why is he NOT medicated?", "INFO\n\nI don\u2019t think you are explaining enough about what your sister has done to deal with his issues. It\u2019s not like you can know, but I cannot in good conscience make a choice until I know a few things first:\n\n> Why is this child \u2018unmedicated\u2019? Does your sister not believe in medicine or does she not have the ability to afford the medication?\n\n> As a follow-up, why is this child allowed to vape? As far as I am aware, you cannot consume e-cigarette products until you are 18, or in some cases, 21. So, what\u2019s up with that?\n\n> Have you seen this child develop better habits as a result of being with your sister, or has it been the same?\n\nI see both sides of this: \n\nOn one hand, it\u2019s really probably not his fault why he _began_ from the step he has, and I feel that if he has genuinely developed better habits on account of your sister being his foster mom, punishing him for being on the journey to better habits is an asshole move. It\u2019s a process, not built in a day.\n\nOn the other, I understand the worry that his current behaviour can be detrimental to your own kids: at your 14 year old\u2019s age, I was looking up to older cousins of mine, and some of them weren\u2019t really in the best set of habits, looking back. However, this did not get me to do those bad habits, contrary to my NIMBY mom\u2019s worries \ud83d\ude02\n\n_It honestly comes down in my opinion to what your sister is doing about him, and if he\u2019s progressing as a person_", "So you have a 16 year old who has spent a lot of time being bounced around the foster care system, is a new person in the family who has ADHD that makes it hard for him to sit still. And instead of thinking of ways you could make him feel included/ keep his mind busy and help as a bonding experience (get his help cooking, play a game a backyard footy, teens dance party/ video game competition ect.) your solution is to uninvite him. Massive yta, you kids don\u2019t misbehave because of his influence they misbehave because you clearly no nothing about parenting if this is your best option here.", "Why don't you make him a special present of a variety of fidget toys or some money for game apps he enjoys.\nOr anything else that will help keep him occupied & focused.", "YTA ..... why not try to make it his best Christmas ever?!?!?!? Read up on foster kids, how many homes they go through, how they count each home, how they are given garbage bags instead of suitcases and boxes, how frequently foster homes are neglectful or abusive & how when the kid turns 18 they get kicked out of the foster system.... often before they even graduate high school!!!! Read up on how often foster kids become homeless when they age out!!! You should be ashamed!", "YTA Holy fuck. Underprivileged child who's obvs had a hard life and u get pissy he can't sit still for hours on end. Maybe pull the stick out your ass", "My formal foster children are now my Adoptive children. If anyone in my family did this I would be completely heartbroken. Kids see and know how you feel about them you don\u2019t have to say it to their face. \nYTA.", "Oh no honey. No no. I know it can be stressful. But as one of the adults, you need to manage your stress better. \n\nLets tackle the language first. Language is easily ignored or forgiven as long as there aren't small kids to influence. Whether it be Uncle Joe who can't stop saying f-bombs or Auntie Anna who keeps referring to coworkers as S-bags, it's fine to ignore it. You should be teaching your teens to ignore it. If there are small kids a simple 'Remember, little kids, big ears. Please refrain from certain words.' is all that is needed. This isn't something to stress over, ever. If you have to remind your own teens that such language isn't acceptable to you, then do so. But don't get onto the foster child about it.\n\nMovement impulses. Speak with your sister about how she handles that at home. Does she arrange for more physical activity? Maybe walks outside? Work with her on finding a way to inject more physical activity during their stay. Even for teens who don't have this issue, staying cooped up inside all day and night isn't ideal. I understand that the teen might have ticks, twitches, bouncing, etc. Movement that can be annoying when everyone else is sitting calmly. Try following your sisters lead on dealing with this. Myself, I have a lot of pain if I sit in dining room chairs for 2 hours straight. I take regular breaks to stretch in hallways. Family gets used to it if you give them a chance.\n\nTrusting almost any teen around alcohol is a recipe for a drunk teen. Even your sweet angles. So, don't imbibe so much that you aren't paying attention OR let the teens hangover be their punishment. \n\nVaping outside. Well, at least it's outside. Make a comfortable spot away from the door for them to do this. It's not your responsibility to make them stop vaping, but you can limit second hand smoke getting into the house.\n\nInfluencing your teen angles. My word hon. Seriously? You are a better parent than that. Talk with your teens before the visit. 'Our rules and expectations still apply to you even if there is someone else in the home that they wont apply to. You are our kids. We have raised you to have certain positive behaviors and you shouldn't mimic bad ones. Demonstrating proper polite behavior will do more to help that young person than mimicking his bad ones.' \n\nYTA. Apologize to your sister and let her know that the teen is welcome and wanted.", "The sister even said that he\u2019s expressed his desire for inclusion and a sense of belonging, that he is trying his best at family gatherings and has made progress. What a long way some empathy would go in this situation. \n\n\nIf OP is worried about the influence that he has on their kids, they should look at what lessons their own actions are teaching them. YTA.", "But foster kid gets up and walks around.  oh and he swears.  So.  /s", "100% agree. \n\nI was also a ward of the state and in foster care for a time and I\u2019ve met too many people like op that think they understand what it\u2019s like without ever having gone through it. Not having anyone in the world that cares whether you live or die is so painful. It multiplies exponentially as you go through life seeing more and more people that have a loving and caring family and the closest thing you get to that are the dreams of what it would be like.\n\nKids are ignorant not blind or dumb. They can see when they\u2019re treated differently and they\u2019ll wonder why. If my foster family had treated me like op wants to do to this kid it would have been devastating.", "Your comment was so nice. I\u2019m \nsorry you had it hard. I\u2019m happy you kept going and are doing something important. I used to work as an  RN at a juvenile detention center. Eye opening. 95 % of those kids needed help. Actually, better off at facility for getting school and help and 3 meals per day. Few kids committed serious crimes. Most were minor or at risk kids. I could go on and on. Your comment made me cry. It\u2019s just nice to hear someone doing good.", "I want to add to this that one of the symptoms of ADHD is Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria. OP mentions that sister stated the the child is sensitive to rejections.  That's literally a symptom of ADHD. So his neurodivergence and likely a significant amount of trauma from being in foster care,  not to mention whatever he may have experienced that brought him into the foster system.... I mean, the sister is so right.  This child DESPERATELY needs, and deserves, to feel accepted and welcome.  There are healthy ways to address specific behaviors if there are issues, and healthy ways to address your own children modeling behaviors that you don't want them to have.  YTA OP. Learn some damn compassion and parenting skills. And good on your sister. Her care could be the thing that changes this kid's life.", "Yes, I agree. YTA. The kids who act up the most, usually also need love and empathy the most. My ADHD kid has been excluded so many times and it has hurt him so, so much. It's damaged his self esteem beyond repair and it is heartbreaking.\n\nYou should invite him, but also make sure to make accomodations. Does he have trouble sitting still at the table? Let him help out serving out the food and pouring the drinks in between. Also let him watch tv/game/be on his phone in between courses. And make sure to explain to the other kids why he gets a different treatment.\n\nAlso, the kid is 16 and almost an adult. Treat him like that: talk with him about his expectations, your fears and ways to solve and prevent problems. When you have ADHD you get overwhelmed easily, but you could create a place for him to sit by himself to 'calm down'.", "YTA- ah the true spirit of Christmas- rejection and judgement. \nHonestly OP- this kid is probably most deserving of a family Christmas. He has experienced repeated and profound rejection throughout his life. Please try to see it from his perspective.", "Maybe OP and other ADULTS should learn to regulate their reactions/emotions to the foster child?", "Exactly.
