Explain the trips you've already taken and how the baby reacted, ask them to come and check the car out and see whether they think it is safe to be putting young children in. The risk is that they'll say it's fine and you should do as you are told but if they are reasonable and sensible they should see how dangerous it is and then their duty of care to the children means that they legally cannot and should not release them into a situation where they believe their safety is compromised.

NTA but really, don\u2019t, especially in that car,", "Are the kids seriously passing out from heat? Can they not open a window, pull down a sun visor, take off their jumper and maybe grab a water bottle? Pretty sure people lived for thousands of years on this planet without aircon. Sheesh calling CPS over this sounds like a first world problem.", "LOL.  Thinking a car needs to have AC.  What do you think we did before the 90s?  Kids didn't die in cars unless they were left locked in parking lots in the midday sun.", "Yes, they are. I don't know if you've noticed, but parts of the world are currently having unprecedented heat waves. Add to that the fact that we haven't, for thousands of years, required children to travel in car seats that tend to retain body heat, inside large metal boxes that tend to get extremely warm (sometimes as hot as 140\u00b0F) when they sit in the sun all day, and children can absolutely be at risk of heat injuries when traveling in unairconditioned cars. Even rolling down the windows may not be very helpful if OP's commute is low speed and/or involves a lot of stop and go traffic. It's also likely that the children are dressed in a manner that's appropriate for being inside an air conditioned building, and not for being in extreme heat. It would be one thing if this was literally the only possible way to transport them (in which case, OP would have to take a lot of steps to mitigate the risk), but it's not. It's not OP's job to ensure the safe transport of the kids, it's their parent's responsibility. And in this case, the parent is refusing to address OP's genuine safety concerns.", "NTA. You're not in California, are you? I know that you have to be driving for a year before you can transport anyone under 20.

Explain to them what your mother and sister are doing and not caring for the safety of the kids.", "NTA, you didn't pop out those kids. Transporting them isn't your responsibility, even if it wasn't a danger. I'd have thrown those car seats in the lawn and gone to work without them day 1, let her die mad.", "Nta. I don't think any of them understand what the word selfish means. It has nothing to do with not having a baby in a hot ass car. They're being neglectful and putting the children in danger.", "NTA, if your sister is going to make you bring her kids home then she should give you the car with the AC and she can drive the sweat box and see how she likes it.", "If something happens to these kids while you're driving them without AC, who will be blamed?\n\nYou.\n\nCall CPS now before one more day of this.\n\nYour sister and your mother are so irresponsible and reckless that they belong behind bars.", "You're not selfish.  You're making the kids the priority.  You have no AC.  It's too hot to be taking those kids in a car without AC.  After you told them one of the kids passed out, that didn't change anything?  So sis & mom would rather you put the kids at risk, than wasting gas for her to do it herself.  This is disgusting.  They are her kids & she should be picking them up.

Actually this could end up being a liability on the daycare especially as you aren't the guardian of the children and still technically a minor.

Those kids are in *danger* and their mom is only thinking about gas money?!! Either she picks them up herself OR she lets you borrow her car so you can bring the kids back in an air-conditioned car so they aren't in danger of overheating.\n\nAs for your mom--just ask her whether she wants a live grand baby or a dead one, because she's going to end up with the latter if she forces you and the baby in that heat trap of a car.  And that scenario will come complete with a police investigation involving the family and scrutiny into the care of kiddos--baby AND toddler.", "Hello, I think that your sister should not force you to take care of your nieces.  You should recommend that she pay someone to look after your nieces.  The issue of air conditioning is a danger for girls.", "NTA, you should be using your sisters ac car if you\u2019re taking the kids. I\u2019m shocked that she isn\u2019t more worried about her babies passing out, you should threaten to tell the cps", "this is going to suck but i would suggest finding another alternative means of transportation. because if thats how petty they are being imagine if the baby does get sick they\u2019re still going to be mad at you. if thats not feasible you should send her a text so you get the gas is more important than the health of my child in text.

I\u2019d tell them that.", "This is the best route. 1.) The kids get the benefit of the better car with safer conditions, 2.) The sister still saves on gas while having a way to compensate OP for the additional labor of drop off and pickup for her children, and 3.) OP by default gets access to the car with AC too!", "Depends on if the part is available, where it will ship from, will a mechanic put it in at a reasonable price.", "This isn\u2019t funny as you think it is. To teach a lesson by giving a child heat stroke could very well kill the child.", "Jeez, old people are inconsiderate these days.", "Even if they aren't, it's the kind of petty revenge I would seek.", "Are u good can u read the news?? If so look up kids dying from heat stroke during long drives it happened alot before aircon was more normal", "Holy shit your niece was suffering from heat stroke, youre absolutely right to take this seriously as your neices are especially vulnerable due to age group. \n\nIf this escalates again, call 911, as a minor yourself I wouldnt attempt to handle this on your own-heat stroke has stages and can be very deadly to younger and older populations- I am an EMT but I am not a medical professional nor am I your medical professional, but if you need a way to cool down;\nWindows open for maximum air flow, small towels wet with cold water over the head,\nCarry a water bottle with you, grab cold water from your job to keep on the ride home and dispense to your neices, if this is not enough remove their shoes, socks, and anything unnecessary, run the cold water over their feet and fan them.

What do you think happened in countries like Spain in the summer.  I travelled all over Europe in the 70s in the height of summer. We had sunglasses, drinks and the windows open.  It was not a thing.  Kids die in locked cars, not cars driving along at 50 miles an hour with the windows open.  Or maybe you don't think kids can spend time in sun without dying?  They don't have air con in the park.  Even in Singapore.", "You too be attentive, OP said the sun is directly in the baby\u2019s face at the time they leave the day care, an open window in that case will warm up the baby more.", "If the kids are passing out, it\u2019s too hot.

I work in a public school (so a little different) and everyone in our building is a mandated reporter. For us that means the witness to the situation has to make the report. So if a student confesses to the lunch lady that they're being abused at home, she's the one who initially calls CPS.", "I live in New England, the shops that work on a/c are pretty standardized about the work that gets done. Back when I had my civic, with the old-type of coolant, I called around and got estimates from $250-$880 - and the cheapest one involved a conversion kit to bring it up to date (it was subsidized by the gov't), so going forward I could use the new, better, safer coolant.\n\nMost shops will give an estimate. Usually it's two trips. First one they put die in the system, then you come back after a few days and they can see just what needs attention before adding coolant.\n\nRegional differences happen, as do parts availability. If it's a standard model, most parts are generally available.", "If \u2018the struggle option\u2019 will lead to the death of the child then you\u2019re not on sound footing.
