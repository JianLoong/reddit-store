Explain the trips you've already taken and how the baby reacted, ask them to come and check the car out and see whether they think it is safe to be putting young children in. The risk is that they'll say it's fine and you should do as you are told but if they are reasonable and sensible they should see how dangerous it is and then their duty of care to the children means that they legally cannot and should not release them into a situation where they believe their safety is compromised.

They could die in your car. If you can't convince your sister to let you use her car you have to find another way to work. Are there buses? Do you have a bike? Hell, you are still young. Quit and work somewhere else. Work anywhere so that your sister can't force you to bring her children home. Babies die in cars all the damn time - you do not want to be charged for manslaughter.", "I think you should look for a different job so it's not an issue.", "NTA you're sister is more worried about saving money than whether or not her children suffer from heatstroke-", "let the car cool out somewhat by opening the windows/doors/back of the car for the brunt of the heat to go. drive with open windows only. make sure you do everything to protect your nieces if this keeps happening. that includes cps and the whole crew. passing out from heat is no joke. kids are pretty robust but not heat prove. NTA", "Depending on where you live, it might actually be illegal for you to drive them. Where I live you are only allowed to drive one blood relative under the age of 5 at a time. Look it up and use it as a loophole if you need\n\nEdit* I might under the age of 18 and what license you have. Sorry I forgot to add that", "It\u2019s likely not legal for you to be driving them. NTA but really, don\u2019t, especially in that car,", "Are the kids seriously passing out from heat? Can they not open a window, pull down a sun visor, take off their jumper and maybe grab a water bottle? Pretty sure people lived for thousands of years on this planet without aircon. Sheesh calling CPS over this sounds like a first world problem.", "LOL.  Thinking a car needs to have AC.  What do you think we did before the 90s?  Kids didn't die in cars unless they were left locked in parking lots in the midday sun.", "Yes, they are. I don't know if you've noticed, but parts of the world are currently having unprecedented heat waves. Add to that the fact that we haven't, for thousands of years, required children to travel in car seats that tend to retain body heat, inside large metal boxes that tend to get extremely warm (sometimes as hot as 140\u00b0F) when they sit in the sun all day, and children can absolutely be at risk of heat injuries when traveling in unairconditioned cars. Even rolling down the windows may not be very helpful if OP's commute is low speed and/or involves a lot of stop and go traffic. It's also likely that the children are dressed in a manner that's appropriate for being inside an air conditioned building, and not for being in extreme heat. It would be one thing if this was literally the only possible way to transport them (in which case, OP would have to take a lot of steps to mitigate the risk), but it's not. It's not OP's job to ensure the safe transport of the kids, it's their parent's responsibility. And in this case, the parent is refusing to address OP's genuine safety concerns.", "NTA. You're not in California, are you? I know that you have to be driving for a year before you can transport anyone under 20. If you are in Cali, you're 16, don't think you've been driving that long yet; you could be in violation.", "she's still not being honest. I'm fully aware of how heat affects the human body. again, windows open, be attentive.", "fair enough. she needs to provide more information for context.", "It sounds very much like OP either lives in the south or southwest where temperatures have been and continue to be 100+ this summer not even counting humidity and the heat index."]}
