Continue bringing them home, but insist on using sister's air conditioned car and she uses yours.\n\nIf she argues, you might mention calling CPS about child abuse. Children should not be passing out due to the heat.", "NTA. You are 16. No one should be putting a toddler and an infant in the car of someone who has been driving for less than a year. You need to be focused when you are driving. It\u2019s ridiculous that your sister would put her infant (who could start screaming) in the car with a new driver. Dangerous for you and the children. You are the only sane person in your family.", "NTA - The reason you stated an opinion was for the health and welfare of the child. It's appalling the mom choses saving money over her daughter's bodily reaction to the heat.  You are not selfish but you sister is an AH making a poor decision while roping in the older one to gang up on you. Perhaps this is pattern in your life. Best to you. Thxs for advocating for your niece who is merely a few months old.", "Absolutely ridiculous for them to put this on you. You are a child. While you are obviously more responsible and dependable than them, this is NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. How dare your sister put her babies in this situation. And if she\u2019s saving gas by not taking them, what the fuck is she doing?? Sitting at home while her kids are in daycare? Lol. Do better. \nI\u2019m sorry this is happening. You should definitely lay firm boundaries and if I were you I\u2019d quit my job instead of taking that responsibility again.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t get pregnant and have kids your sister did so it\u2019s her job to take care of them. It takes a village to raise kids of course but not bother to even ask you is WILD. \nAlso do the windows not roll down on the car cause if the baby is passing out that\u2019s very serious and I suggest you not even put the kids in that car if it\u2019s that bad. regardless you didn\u2019t ask to be taking care of someone else\u2019s kids and it shouldn\u2019t even be your problem. And if your mom doesn\u2019t care i suggest you find a new living situation cause you will just be used and used.", "When you say passed out, was your niece awake and alert (moving, making noises, maybe crying) and then suddenly still, or hard to rouse? If so you need to sit down with your mom one on one and explain the gravity of the situation. Heat stroke is a MAJOR issue, and not to be taken lightly, especially with young children. Additionally, you should\u2019ve been roped into the conversation about taking your niece to daycare. Do you pay for your own car insurance, gas, etc? If not, I can understand your mom sitting down and gently asking/telling you that since she pays for one or both of these things, she\u2019s requiring you do this for her. Even so, you should\u2019ve been included in the conversation beforehand. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is the one who decided to have kids not you.

In my state it would be illegal for you to drive them since they don't qualify as immediate family. I'd look up the graduated license requirements where you live.

Turns out she was watching her siblings and we were like we can\u2019t have unsupervised children while you\u2019re training if needed we can do this on a different day. \n\nThen said give me on second and tried to leave the kids in the car on a 80 degree day i remember cuz it was a bit hot that day. We were like that was quick then told us and we were like that\u2019s a major no. Either you wait for another day or someone has to take those kids then tried to say they can wonder around the area. We were so flabbergasted. Then at that point while she was calling a friend (heads up she wasn\u2019t she was faking it and planned to leave the kids in the car) we discussed we weren\u2019t comfortable with this and made the decision to let her go we didn\u2019t want to be reliable for any safety issues. \n\nShe tried to ruin our store and SM rep stating we didn\u2019t welcome her and didn\u2019t accommodate her. Even got her mom roped in with Facebook. I made the mistake of answering the phone to explain but words definitely got twisted. All I said was Michael\u2019s employees were looking out for the kids. It wasn\u2019t till the husband called the store and almost yelled at my manager. She was like no hold on that\u2019s not what and explained what actually happened. He was very quiet on the phone then immediately apologized then the Facebook post went down and everything. It was nuts. Mind you the onboarding and training would\u2019ve been about 2-3 hours and that meant unsupervised kids either in the outdoor mall or in a car that wasn\u2019t gonna have the AC on cuz their sister wanted to keep the keys on her.", "For years we had lead in gas and stunted the brain development of entire generations", "The lead was removed because it was getting into the soil . Now, if you were eating the paint chips with lead in it, then you would have a problem. Long story short, unless you are on extremely hot areas, like the Southwest with temps in the 100s, air-conditioning can be considered optional. This is not to say the OP isn't being taken advantage of by her family."]}
