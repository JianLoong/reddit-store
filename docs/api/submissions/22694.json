Continue bringing them home, but insist on using sister's air conditioned car and she uses yours.\n\nIf she argues, you might mention calling CPS about child abuse. Children should not be passing out due to the heat.", "NTA. You are 16. No one should be putting a toddler and an infant in the car of someone who has been driving for less than a year. You need to be focused when you are driving. It\u2019s ridiculous that your sister would put her infant (who could start screaming) in the car with a new driver. Dangerous for you and the children. You are the only sane person in your family.", "NTA - The reason you stated an opinion was for the health and welfare of the child. It's appalling the mom choses saving money over her daughter's bodily reaction to the heat.  You are not selfish but you sister is an AH making a poor decision while roping in the older one to gang up on you. Perhaps this is pattern in your life. Best to you. Thxs for advocating for your niece who is merely a few months old.", "Absolutely ridiculous for them to put this on you. You are a child. While you are obviously more responsible and dependable than them, this is NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. How dare your sister put her babies in this situation. And if she\u2019s saving gas by not taking them, what the fuck is she doing?? Sitting at home while her kids are in daycare? Lol. Do better. \nI\u2019m sorry this is happening. You should definitely lay firm boundaries and if I were you I\u2019d quit my job instead of taking that responsibility again.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t get pregnant and have kids your sister did so it\u2019s her job to take care of them. It takes a village to raise kids of course but not bother to even ask you is WILD. \nAlso do the windows not roll down on the car cause if the baby is passing out that\u2019s very serious and I suggest you not even put the kids in that car if it\u2019s that bad. regardless you didn\u2019t ask to be taking care of someone else\u2019s kids and it shouldn\u2019t even be your problem. And if your mom doesn\u2019t care i suggest you find a new living situation cause you will just be used and used.", "When you say passed out, was your niece awake and alert (moving, making noises, maybe crying) and then suddenly still, or hard to rouse? If so you need to sit down with your mom one on one and explain the gravity of the situation. Heat stroke is a MAJOR issue, and not to be taken lightly, especially with young children. Additionally, you should\u2019ve been roped into the conversation about taking your niece to daycare. Do you pay for your own car insurance, gas, etc? If not, I can understand your mom sitting down and gently asking/telling you that since she pays for one or both of these things, she\u2019s requiring you do this for her. Even so, you should\u2019ve been included in the conversation beforehand. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is the one who decided to have kids not you. Anything you do to help out should be your choice. She and your mother should definitely asked you instead of just expecting you to do it. There selfish for thinking you are obligated to take care of kids that aren\u2019t yours.", "NTA. You are not their parent. They have no business forcing you to take on parental duties.", "Info: how hot is it when you leave and how long is the drive", "Info: how would you get to work and home if your mother wasn\u2019t giving you a car with or without strings attached?", "ESH\n\nso, I'm assuming the windows in the car roll down. summer is hot, we get it. I'm sorry, but I find it difficult to believe that a child would pass out from heat exhaustion on a ride home in a vehicle with the windows open for ventilation. so, unless you're driving with all the windows up and the heat on.....\n\nyour mother and sister need to think about this. it's your sister's responsibility to get the kids to and from daycare. yes, fuel is expensive. it's all part of owning a vehicle. so, one way is she could do the pickup/dropoff herself OR offer to have the AC in the vehicle you're driving repaired. \n\nthis is a give and take thing. right now, neither of you are doing anything of the sort. make the suggestion. get the AC repaired, and you're happy to take the kids. if not....", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Take some large cups of ice water and wet some clean rags for the baby and get them some shade somehow, like a hat or blanket in the window with the other side rolled down, etc. You can also mist them with a little spray bottle or one of those dollar tree squirt fans.", "NTA.

In my state it would be illegal for you to drive them since they don't qualify as immediate family. I'd look up the graduated license requirements where you live.

The temperature in Phoenix has been 110\u00b0plus for the past 19 days.
