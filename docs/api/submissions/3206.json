Prior to that, I had not realized that this was actually an ethnic group of people. Even then, it took well into my adulthood until I first saw that using the G word to describe Roma people is on par with using the N word to describe Black people. And when you consider the number of songs that prominently feature the G word in the title and/or the refrain, I was shocked to find out it was actually an ethnic slur. \n\nI probably used the word just as freely, when I had no idea that it had negative connotations, because hey, there it is being spouted from my radio and TV like it's nothing.
