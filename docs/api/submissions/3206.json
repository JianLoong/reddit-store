It's not, I just didn't know how to word the title any better\n\nSo I had been looking after my nephew and niece, my sister's two children (nephew = 10 y.o. & niece = 9 y.o.). Their school had to close unexpectedly for two days due to maintenance problems and they spent both of those days under my supervision whilst she was at work (my sister and the kids dad split up & he now lives and works in a different country)\n\nMy sister is vegan and quite a militant one and all, always badgering my mum & I about eating non-vegan food in our own homes even when she isn't there, returning toys I've bought my nephew and niece for birthdays and christmas, etc. She will give her children the choice on whether or not to become fully vegan when they're a little bit older. \n\nNote: her children are not 100% vegan yet, she is alright with non-vegan food being given to them when they go round friend's houses % friends birthday parties\n\nDay 1: My sister had packed a vegan lunch for the kids to eat whilst at mine, which the children absolutely detested. They both didn't eat all of the food and my sister blamed me over it. I think they'd seen some chocolate that I have and got a bit upset. I know that the children have been picked on at school over the vegan foods that their mum packs for them and they want to try things the other children have\n\nDay 2: Sister was in a rush and couldn't make her kids anything. Lunch time comes around and I'm emptying my freezer before I do a big food shop, so I put two pizzas on, a bbq chicken pizza & a cheese pizza. The plan was to give them the cheese pizza, if I give my sister non-vegan food but vegetarian suitable food she doesn't get as uspet, and I would pick at the bbq chicken pizza (the bbq chicken pizza was quite big) and not offer it to the kids but if the kids did have a few slices of the bbq chicken pizza then I would not stop them. They have been/will be given the choice. Both of the kids did end up taking a couple of slices of the bbq chicken pizza\n\nSister asks what the kids had eaten, the kids had seemed quite chipper when she came to collect them. They told her what they'd had eaten and asks to see me inside the house. She blows her lid at me that the kids should have known about the \"dangers\" of the meat on the bbq chicken pizza first and that they should have had controlled permission before having a slice, whatever that means. I mention that the kids aren't 100% vegan and have similar foods to the bbq chicken pizza when they go to friends birthday parties. She storms off saying that I was rude about leaving the pizza open and indirectly calls me a danger on the family group chat, as if I was letting her kids stick forks in plug sockets rather that letting them eat a bit of pizza. She's the youngest so a few family members take her side by default (they're not vegan either) and are giving me gyp for it\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1669378195, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4bvb4/aita_for_not_actively_hiding_a_pizza_and_not/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're offering something to the kids that their mom doesn't want them to have, and saying that it's a 9 or 10 year old's choice whether to have it. You'll get more sympathy from commenters than for offering meat to a vegan's kids than you would offering pork to a Jewish or Muslim mother's kids, or soda to a mother with a no-sugar or no-caffeine policy, but it's still not cool.

They shouldn\u2019t have strict rules about their food. \n\nThe original post did not go into the information of how the kids felt about everything. There\u2019s been updated text. So my comment stemmed from trying to figure out how the kids felt about it. The dynamic between the kids and their mom surrounding food was very ambiguous. \n\nBut also recognize that these kids have to survive childhood with their mother. This isn\u2019t something that can be judged in a bubble. These kids have to go back home with her and deal with her reaction over it all (my \u201cthat\u2019s between them and their mom\u201d comment). Yea, they\u2019re just kids, but also that\u2019s the reality of it. If they didn\u2019t realize it was meat and ate it because OP didn\u2019t \u201cwarn\u201d them about it, it could cause anxiety surrounding food and/or their mom and distrust in their uncle. If they knew it was meat anyway, they\u2019d have to deal with their mother\u2019s reaction. There are dynamics at play. \n\nThe use of quotes was confusing to me. Was it \u201cI didn\u2019t wasn\u2019t them *wink wink nudge nudge\u201d or a flat out \u201cthey didn\u2019t know they ate meat.\u201d \n\nTo me, he\u2019d be the asshole if they unknowingly ate meat. But he\u2019d also be the asshole of this situation caused more guilt/anxiety surrounding their mom and food. I understand his feelings about a strict and unrealistic diet that his sister enforces on her kids because of food chemicals/etc, but that doesn\u2019t mean that his decision doesn\u2019t have shitty ripple affects for the kids.", "Nope, mom didn't provide lunch, they had to eat something. And mom is being very hypocritical too. No reason to state op is attacking her kids."]}
