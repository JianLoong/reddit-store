It would be the same if you were reading a book or going to the gym.

Buy a switch or/and a steam deck play in bed. Problem solved.", "NTA. What your wife is saying isn't malicious but is definitely a dig. I would suggest renaming it to \"me time\" or \"morning off\" or something similar, just to make it clear that it's your time to do with as you see fit, whether that be gaming or sleeping or even going out for your morning coffee.", "You\u2019re NTA. But if your wife struggles to wake up early more than you, it might be worth considering whether you would get the same amount of enjoyment from gaming at a different time of day, if it meant she could have a longer stretch of sleep. If having a leisurely morning is important to you, then fair enough!\n\nIt also sounds like she needs more sleep than you do. Does she get any leisure time when she\u2019s awake? Assuming she does, you\u2019re definitely NTA. If she doesn\u2019t, I can see why she finds it a bit irritating.", "NTA \n\nYou are being productive. Not sure what games you\u2019re playing but maybe you levelled up or unlocked a new map or learned to fight with a new character. \nDon\u2019t let this take away the joy of spending your free time the way you like. \nIf she\u2019s just joking and you guys banter like this normally, just throw it back to her: \u201cI was super productive this morning, I completed two temples and rode horseback to the other side of Hyrule; what did you do yesterday morning in your free time?\u201d", "NTA, your wife is jealous", "Your time is your time.  Nta", "I pray for this day.  Mine are 7 years apart though so I doubt it'll work like that for me.  Me and the wifey have the same deal and mine's spent with D3.", "I'm going to go against the grain a little bit, here...\n\nI think you and your wife are looking at this time differently.\n\nYou consider this time in the mornings as \"me-time\" --a way of recharging by relaxation-- and feel that you should each be able to use your own \"me-time\" however you like.\n\nYour wife considers this time in the morning as \"sleep time\" --a way of catching up on missed sleep-- and feels like sleep is productive and therefore the time should be used productively.\n\nShe might also feel a little shorted... if she *needs* more sleep, then she doesn't have a real choice of how she spends that time. So you're getting time to spend on your interests, and she isn't.\n\nYou're... both right. You can spend your down time as you see fit. She is being shorted. Sleep is important. You can't sleep if you aren't sleepy. You're both getting an equal amount of \"lay-in\" time. But there's a different between equivalence and equality.\n\nI get that you've been \"casual joking\" about this, but I'm betting there actually are some budding resentments. So it's probably a good idea to stop talking about the lay-in time specifically, and instead focus on conversations about if/how both of you are able to feel like your needs are being met. \n\nNAH", "NTA it is a lowkey jab, similar to when you go to the living room and family 'jokes' \"oh you're finally out of your cave?\"", "NTA. It\u2019s definitely a jab that she plays off as a joke. But it\u2019s a jab all the same.", "NTA, recreational activities are good for mental health and stability.

I see nothing wrong with either options.\nAs long as it\u2019s a healthy balance for you both and the kids", "There is some info that would help here. \n\nAre the kids harassing her out of bed at 9-10 in the morning or is she choosing to get up? Does she do all the chores around the house or do you pull your share? How long are you doing your game time? Is it equal to her sleeping late or are you gaming until after lunch? \n\nThese are important things to include in the post that was conveniently left out to make your wife look like she is just being mean to you. Sure she could be using her words to communicate but something tells me you are taking way more down time than her and not being very helpful on the weekends like she wants.", "I would think 'lay-in' means 'sleep-in'.. so if you and her have different ideas of what that means (I agree with your wife, it is for sleeping) then you two just need to talk it out. You both should have 'me time'. NTA.", "As someone who desperately loves to sleep in, if his 'me' time isn't sleep related, he should let her sleep in both days and she could agree to give him three hours of 'me' time to do what he wants after she wakes up.  Maybe you should check in with her and see if she wants to renegotiate weekend time off.", "So she gets lay in time twice over the weekend and he only gets 3 hours? That's not really fair", "Ooh that\u2019s a good idea. Though, with kids, 8am may not be early enough, and that\u2019s still a little bit of sleeping in that he gets to do.", "NTA, but does your wife get non-sleeping downtime/fun time for herself at another point in the week? I'm someone who needs like 9 hours a night and it is genuinely a but frustrating to realize that even if my partner and I work the same number of hours and do the same number of hours of chores, he will have more free time than me, simply because his body doesn't require as much sleep. \n\nI think it's worth thinking about whether this lay-in time is really a \"bonus\" sleep for her, or if it is something that her body actually *needs*. If you have kids I am guessing she probably doesn't get as much sleep during the week as she needs (maybe you don't either, but since you've said you don't need as much sleep as her).\n\nIn which case, if she needs this in order to be healthy--then it probably shouldn't count as \"fun time\" for her, if that makes sense. I know parents have to just deal with not getting enough sleep, but sleep is pretty important for health, and I can understand her frustration that for her, this is a necessity for her health, whereas for you, it is down time.", "doesn't matter if she needs it or not, if she gets one day of no responsabilities in the morning so does he", "I agree, but I can see why she would be frustrated. It's no one's fault, just unfortunate.", "only entitlement should get her frustrated", "NTA", "NTA, she sounds a bit passive aggressive to me though. People often say they are joking about something when they are not.", "If I had to hazard a guess, I would say your wife views her lay ins as a necessary healing process vs enjoyable relaxation - or possibly a combination of both, and views your game time purely as enjoyment. \n\nI know its a light hearted thing between you two, but maybe you should check in with your wife about how she's coping with her share of the workload", "NTA - stop calling it 'lay in' and just call it 'me time'", "Stop\nCalling it lay-in time and start calling it \u201cme time\u201d.\n\nEveryone\u2019s entitled to some me time.\n\nNTA", "NTA. While she may come off as joking, I sense some passive aggressiveness and it is causing you to feel guilty with how you spend your \"me time\". If she thinks the house needs more productivity, she could try getting up earlier on her lay in day.", "Why are you even asking if she was joking and you know she didn't mean it?", "I agree! It reminds me of arguments where couples have different appetites. They each get the same portion of food, but one gets leftovers for lunch and the other finishes it all and has to cook something new the next day. Equal but not equitable. Everybody has different needs.", "Yeah, that's not a compromise at all.", "What if he doesn\u2019t want to sleep?", "Stop calling it a lay-in day or w/e.

She also deserves free/personal time, as do you.
