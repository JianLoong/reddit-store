You both deserve equal 'me time' to do as you wish.", "NTA like you said you take turns with your free time, so it\u2019s already fair. You just have different ways of using your free time and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. If you value the video games more than sleeping in that\u2019s your choice and she is kinda being a butthead by making your choice feel invalid.", "NTA. Rebrand it as \u201cme\u201d time.

Ask her how much more \"productive\" she would be if she didn't sleep in until 9-10.", "NTA- you\u2019re choosing to spend your time each as you see fit\n\nYou may as well wake her up saying she\u2019s breathing, she can be more productive \n\nDowntime is a beautiful thing, however you spend it", "Nope. Her lay-in time is your personal time imo. You\u2019re being productive\u2026 producing tons of button combinations. ;)", "NTA\n\n\nJust tell her how you feel and you like a little alone time. This happens in relationship that sometimes you tease about the wrong things. I don't see a big deal here.", "NTA. It's your time, you can use it as you want. \n\nIf her \"joking\" bothers you, tell her so.

So you choosing your off day time in the morning to play games is your choice. She chooses to sleep longer and that\u2019s her choice. It would be the same if you were reading a book or going to the gym. I think the aspect of playing games is the problem in itself, because playing games is silly and unproductive according to some people in society. Which is stupid. It should be seen as another form of relaxation to take some stress off. \r  \nInstead of sleeping longer you could also be more productive right? Then why even have a lay in day in the first place?", "NTA.

Does she carry the majority of the weight? If so this could be her subtle way of telling you she'd like more help, its passive aggressive and lacks adult communication skills but if she keeps saying it its not a joke. A joke is once, not repeatedly, then it is speaking truths passive aggressively.\n\nIf you DO pull your share of the household work, you're allowed to use your spare time however you see fit. I think some people really do have old fashion views of what is a \"waste of time\". Its as if you aren't producing a tangible result, its time ill spent and thats a lie.\n\nIf it brings you joy and relaxes you, it doesn't need to be productive. Not every waking moment of existence needs to be productive. Thats unhealthy. \n\nDoes she not have any hobbies?", "When your children get to an age where you are uncool, then it\u2019s actually quite easy."]}
