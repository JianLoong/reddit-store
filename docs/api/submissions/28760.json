IMO children are exempt from being labeled AHs, and you and the other adult were both justified trying to consider and be nice to the people y'all care for. You just handled this suboptimally, since she is of course free to ask if you'd do her daughter a solid and your rationale came off inconsiderate.

My mom would let us have our tantrum but usually she would take us outside. She would never reward our tantrums but she would let us have something once we calmed down. We learned that she rewards us for stopping our tantrums. \n\n\nNow in this case, if I were the mother I would take my child outside and let them ride out their tantrum and once the child is calm and communicating their feelings, I would ask if they want something else in the shop or we could go to another shop that hopefully has what they want originally. \n\n\nI don\u2019t think child throwing a tantrum is selfish. They are simply expressing their frustrations in a way they only know how. \n\n\nI don\u2019t think the mom is actually teaching her child to throw tantrums intentionally but she does teach her child if she kept prolonging the tantrums she could get what she wanted.", "And pitching a GD fit in public is never the way to handle it. Children don\u2019t know better, it\u2019s our job to teach them. Giving in to these behaviors could lead to entitlement and solidify in that child\u2019s mind that THIS is how I get what I want. Noooope, you can have some cake when you communicate your feelings appropriately, and the world allows for it. Let\u2019s talk about these feelings, yeah? We can cry together and eat cake together. Sometimes shit sucks, but we\u2019re NOT going to take it out on strangers.", "And my answer to that would\u2019ve been \u201cand now you NEVER will\u201d and he\u2019d have been taken home and I\u2019d go back by myself to finish shopping. He\u2019d also never go in public until he stops the manipulative bs. I\u2019m so grateful I didn\u2019t have to deal with that or tantrums.", "Totally. I have friends who just won't understand why their 6 yo daughter still throws crazy long tantrums... I told them a hundred times: she knows you guys cave in and give her whatever she wants after 15 minutes of non-stop screaming, why the fuck would she stop after 10 minutes???\nBoth my kids tried that once and learned quickly enough that it gave them actually less than what they wanted.\nParents have to hold their ground, no matter how hard it can be to hear your kids cry, and no matter what strangers around may think of you.", "Exactly. Neurodivergence isn\u2019t a free pass to have tantrums and outbursts without any attempt to de-escalate. Kids will have tantrums and outbursts, they all do. But based on the mom\u2019s response and how she approached this she is not helping her child at all. Tantrums only get worse when you continually \u201cfix\u201d the problem rather than addressing the feeling and emotions. If the child was ND or NT it doesn\u2019t matter, the mom\u2019s response was about as poor as you can get.", "Yep! This. It\u2019s easier for them to have an outburst when stimulated, but it\u2019s the mother\u2019s responsibility to teach the kid how to behave when something doesn\u2019t go their way and handle the situation properly.", "And that's partly why society has gone to hell in a hand basket!", "I tried the \"planned ignore\" for a while. But it absolutely doesn't work unless everyone is on board. Most of the time I would ignore the tantrum and when my son calmed down if the request was reasonable I would let him have it. After the tantrum. After he didn't get the attention he wanted for the behavior. Once he was calm I would tell him to ask nicely, then. Depending on what it was I would ask if he thought he deserved it.", "Boomer here - that would\u2019ve definitely earned me something but I wouldn\u2019t have liked it.", "Imo one of the most important things my mom did when raising tiny me was setting expectations before we even got out of the car. She'd tell me, \"we're here to get X, Y, and Z and that's it. We're not going to look at toys, or get candy.\" That way, I knew ahead of time not to ask for things, and she didn't have to tell me no. I never threw tantrums in stores.", "these are the same people who ask you to move on an airplane when you chose and/or paid for your seat. I NEVER move unless they're moving me to first class for the request. I am sorry but just because you're a couple doesn't mean you will die if you dont talk to your partner for the flight duration.", "And how exactly did the mom know OP wasn't taking the Swiss roll home to *his* kids? That just because her kid was the only one visible, OP wasn't taking it for his own children, niblings, etc?", "I wonder how many kids raised this way will actually see the errors in how they were raised. Or do they, in turn become entitled jerks like their parents? I wonder what the percentage is.", "Exactly. Go buy the kid a box of damn HoHos.", "Spot.On.", "*would\u2019ve", "Smart mom\ud83d\udc4d", "Thank you! Many times the backstory doesn't matter. OP arrived at the store first and bought the item first - end of story. Reason for buying the cake does not matter.", "You sound like the nicest mom. I wish I was so lucky to have a mom like you when I was growing up!", "You\u2019re an awesome mom. Every parent should have this philosophy.", "You get what you get, and you don't have a fit.", "Exactly, some of them act like they were born together. If they really wanted to sit together so badly they should have paid for the seat.\n\nThe worst incident I had was a guy simply refusing to give up my seat (it was a window seat I had paid for) because his wife was in the middle seat and he was assigned the middle seat behind his wife. He started shouting at me to \u201cadjust because I\u2019m a bachelor\u201d and I wasn\u2019t having any of it. \n\nI\u2019m not really an easygoing or affable person on the best of days and I would have loved to open a sichuan sauce packet I was holding onto and throw it at his eyes to shut him up but I just sighed and called the flight attendant who explained that he would be handcuffed and thrown outside the airplane if he refused to comply.", "To know for sure, we would have to have a vast sample of people probably conceived and born shortly after a widespread traumatizing event like a war that makes people grateful to be alive and to have survived. If their parents raised them like gifts of the Gods and they turned out to be entitled adults and entitled parents, I think it could be safe to say the entitlement sticks.", "I've told my kids that our hearts, minds, arms, and door are open to their friends without judgment or a time limit. You're welcome, too!", "Thank you! I wish you had the mom you deserved, too. If you didn't, that's a reflection of *her*, not you, and don't ever forget that. Some people aren't equipped to be parents but they do it anyway. Any failings are theirs, not yours. The beautiful thing about life is that we can choose every day to be different/better and we can make our own families, however that looks. I hope you're living a life that brings you happiness, satisfaction, and contentment, or whatever adjectives are most important to you. LOL!", "Thank you. Some folks just don't have it in them or fail to see how important the \"soft skills\" are. For my husband and me, they're the most important and things like academics are secondary. I guess our differences are what makes the world go 'round!", "Yes, exactly! I had the best mom (and dad). Sadly, she passed away when I was 26 way back in 1995 (yes, I'm old). If she had to punish us, she had only one rule - if we complained about the punishment, it would be doubled. We were pretty good about not complaining within earshot because going twice as long without TV or being grounded on a Saturday would have been unbearable! LOL!", "I\u2019d have been sitting down very gently for a while"]}
