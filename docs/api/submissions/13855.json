I am a good cook but I don\u2019t enjoy it so we\u2019ve always just said I can\u2019t cook.

You can't diffuse this without caving in to their demands, which would be only for their sake and all you would get out of it was reduced criticism at best.

I don't care about your god damn food.\" And if they agree to these terms, then maybe, if you have the time and inclination, if they've been nice enough for a while that cooking for them sounds like something you would want to do, then maybe you could make something once in a while, but it should never be a requirement.", "YTA, you can just purchase something and bring it with you. If all family gatherings are pot lucks and you never bring anything because you say you can\u2019t cook, you are just being lazy at that point. They had every right to call you out.

Husband goes alone and as it\u2019s only women the family wants to bring a dish, the problem should be solved.  \n\nDaughter not going is simply because she can\u2019t be left alone with out parents and dad is on call.", "It seems the husband is already not going because he is on call. He wasn't going anyway. Now OP also isn't going, she is going to spend easter with her family instead.\nWhat is she supposed to do then? Bring only the 5yo to the in-laws?", "She specifically is not attending anymore.  Problem solved!", "She tried that and they didn\u2019t serve it \u2013 that\u2019s making it perfectly clear that only home-made is good enough. Or should she just buy something knowing that it\u2019s going to go in the bin and that she\u2019s still going to be judged?", "The simple solution is not to to go the party, which is what OP is doing. There's no further problem so long as OP's family doesn't attend any more pot lucks.", "Yeah I was on her side until she mentioned cooking for a party is more time consuming. Oh really? So fine the other spend time and money but when it\u2019s their turn \u2018no thank you, I don\u2019t like it\u2019", "I would assume this would also fall under this \u201cno store bought\u201d rule husbands family seems to have. OP said they have tried to bring a store bought item beforehand and it wasn\u2019t accepted. Furthermore, it said the women bring a dish, not drinks or a snack board; I\u2019m almost 99% sure husbands family is going to even say no snack board cause it wasn\u2019t \u201ccooked\u201d", "Why is OP's husband doing all the cooking in their family? You guys don't have issue with that? Sure let's ignore that and focus on the one day OP could get off her lazy ass and cook something.\n\nFlip the genders and say the OP is doing all the cooking, then you hypocrites would be skewering her husband in the comments.", "NTA exactly for that second sentence. They are being too choosey.", "Why should anything *have* to be homemade? As long as it\u2019s good quality store bought, food is food.", "In that case NTA. As long as you bring something it should not matter who cooked it.", "Why should OP be forced to cook when the family refused the food she offered to bring (store bought)? They clearly have a tradition that women make the foood and bring it but if OP doesn't like cooking, she shouldn't be forced.", "What did you bring?", "Well, the edits were not up when I made my judgement, so I could only go off what I knew.", "There\u2019s a clue in the \u201call the women\u2026\u201d", "Totally agree! They\u2019ve been freeloading at the potlucks for years. She does cook but \u2018doesn\u2019t wanna\u2019 for the family, while has no problem partaking of the fruits of their labor.", "So like, what about every single man at the party that didn\u2019t prepare a dish?", "This be an adult argument is so dumb. Doing all those things if for yourself and your home not extended family. I\u2019m not going to be forced to do something I don\u2019t like for people that pressure me and call me out for not wanting part of their sexist tradition. Op decided not to attend so she doesn\u2019t have to do the things she doesn\u2019t want and is still the asshole? How? Why is she forced to do something she doesn\u2019t want to for people unwilling to compromise?", "I mean the alternative to a potluck is that one person now has to make a whole meal themselves. A holiday meal for 12 is a lot of work no matter what, the potluck style is meant to spread out that work.", "Yeah none of this rings the women must make the food. They just show up empty handed and that\u2019s shitty. OP is mad she got caught lying too, so deff TA.", "It doesn't seem like it's based on gender, the extended family just wanted a home-cooked contribution to the potluck. OP doesn't want to, and her husband doesn't want to.", "This!!! We had a friend who couldn\u2019t cook to save her life and she came to a party where we had a chili contest and she brought out her crockpot of chili and she won!! Then she admitted she bought a big chili from Wendy\u2019s and put it in her crockpot and sprinkled cheese on top\u2026.", "That's a them problem. OP brought something and didn't mooch.", "Do you think these people will accept charcuterie boards? I had neighbours who wouldn't touch a thing if it is not homemade, traditional and cooked. If you bring drinks, that is not enough for them either, if you bring store bought things, that's grounds for shaming you. Can't win with such people. , OP is NTA. Better not bother with ungrateful in-laws.", "I suspect that you meant to respond to the person above me, not me.", "Doesn't matter. It should have been offered at the very least. If people decided to not eat it, then OP could have adjusted & brought a different store-bought thing the next time. Not even offering it was petty as hell and a deliberate F* you to OP.", "Because his family thinks cooking is womens work.", "Lmao this reminds me of the incident that single-handedly made all the women in my ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s family hate me. It was Thanksgiving and his aunt pulls me aside to let me know that after dinner, all the women are to report to the kitchen to clean and \u201clet the men relax and watch football\u201d. I loudly exclaimed \u201cjust because I\u2019m a woman doesn\u2019t mean I \u2018have to\u2019 do anything\u201d. Cue surprised pickachu faces from everyone in the room. After dinner, my ex and I helped clear the table and put away the folding tables/chairs. Then I proceeded to go take shots of eggnog with his uncles (they were asking me who made the better nog. We were joking and having a grand old time). All the women were super bitter lol.", "I mean I get it but then couldn\u2019t it be argued the other family members presumably have other obligations as well? It\u2019s not like the time and effort is any less for everyone else. Presumably at least some of them also are two working parent households. And doing it not potluck-style just means that time and effort is now all on the one person designated to cook for everyone.", "I mean, they\u2019re both happy to indulge in everyone else\u2019s efforts, money, and time. They could at least contribute in some other way.\n\nFor that reason, OP YTA.", "With the additional edit saying store bought wasn't served on purpose, I'm not sure. \n\nI refuse to cook for family gatherings. I will gladly pick up something from catering or a dessert though. If it wasn't served, I'd probably just stop too. \n\nThen again my family is completely understanding of my not wanting to cook and I am lucky", "What's the difference between bringing a dish they throw in the garbage every time and not bringing one?  Might as well save on waste.", "That\u2019s between them and their spouses. If OP had brought a dish cooked by husband and they got mad that she made a man cook, it would be a clear NTA. Here the husband may also be an AH, but at minimum OP is an AH, and they possibly are AHs collectively as a couple.", "So she decided not to go.  What's the problem?\n\nThe simplest answer is for her to contribute something she bought at the store, but the group rejected that, and that's what makes oP NTA.  They don't get to demand a specific sexist obligation from her and have the high ground when she refuses.", "That\u2019s what you might mean by potluck, but clearly her family doesn\u2019t seem to work that way  - since it\u2019s pretty much been defined that it has to be something home-made \u2013 see the bit about store-bought not being served, then clearly she can\u2019t just bring the bread or the cheese or the fruit. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t sound overly stupid, if that would\u2019ve worked she would\u2019ve done it by now.", "OP mentioned bringing store bought items and was turned down previously. That detail is what has me hanging on to NTA. Furthermore, his family is making cooking a women\u2019s thing and I am completely against the idea that anything is a \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u2019s\u201d job. For me, it\u2019s simply a job you don\u2019t want to do and might even pay someone else to do. Here, paying someone else (store bought) doesn\u2019t seem like an option. So, I would bring the shittiest most plain dish I could think of and tell them all to enjoy the sweet taste of misogyny", "This exactly! I have in laws who can\u2019t cook, or work long hours, those in laws bring store bought rolls, chips and dip, cheese trays, or drinks. They can contribute without cooking.", "They don't. If you don't like the discrimination, whatever that is, don't go. If you don't like it applied to you but don't mind it applied to the rest of them, keep going but bring nothing.", "Looking at the reaction from the in-laws I don\u2019t blame her for lying tbh", "Yeah, this is such a telling bit of information. It means they don't care about the food, they care about the role she plays, because if it was just about food then there is no reason that shouldn't be served and eaten. I'll eat store bought or home cooked, idgaf and the only people who do are not the kind of people I'd want to share a meal with anyway.", "YTA You can prep food days in advance. It's not fair that they just don't contribute but everyone else does.", "This is the level of petty I aspire to. I hope OP sees this.", "Tbh I do cook but I\u2019d have refused to cook on principle if I\u2019d been told that!", "So you\u2019ve been going to these events for years and partaking but never contributing? Do you at least do dishes or help with cleanup? \nI feel like this is ESH, because it\u2019s rude to expect everyone else to put in the effort except your family.", "The women in my family are the ones who generally do the cooking for family events and it is kinda rooted in misogyny, in that society forces girls to cook and doesn't often have room for boys to learn. When there are situations where a job that's often women's work is 'naturally' only done by women, it's often rooted in misogyny - nobody was being purposeful about it, the boys in my family didn't aim to make us do the job, it happened because of things in our society.\n\nThat being said, we don't force the women to do the cooking, and we would never say, force my sister-in-law to make a dish for our family events. I remember one time my older brother saying he can't follow recipes from the internet and his wife has to do some translation and I laughed at him and mocked him (a lot), and when his wife went back to work full time he learned to follow a recipe, because he's an adult. \n\nBasically, all of this wouldn't be a problem if OP could just bring store-bought cupcakes or something *and* if they hadn't been like \"this is *the woman's* job\". It's very very weird to try and force your sister-in-law to do the cooking for your family events, when the person who's actually your sibling is a capable adult. My SIL is absolutely part of the family, but it's my brother who has to do the work part of the family gatherings, because my SIL has her own family she has to do the work for.", "How is that between them and their spouses when mil and sil are specifically requesting women to make the dish? She bought store bought, they said no, and they don\u2019t want men to cook. There is literally 0 option.", "To be fair, KFC coleslaw kicks ass\n\nEspecially with BBQ :)", "Two problems here. Neither OP couple is not adding to the potluck, but are still taking.\n\nSecond, they are expecting her to do it for some reason. OP is TA for the first, in laws for the second.\n\nBut you make a good point on the store bought, so maybe not OP on the first.", "Well then OPs family can pick something from the store that they can happily take home and eat if that happens. \n\nIt's not unreasonable to be expected to bring something to a potluck. It is u reasonable to try to dictate what everyone brings.", "If you ever go to Texas, the slaw at Bill Millers is the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever eaten. It\u2019s vinegar based though, not mayo, so it\u2019s good for people who don\u2019t like slaw normally too!", "They weren\u2019t permitted to buy food- they would have contributed in a way that works for them but the family required home cooked."]}
