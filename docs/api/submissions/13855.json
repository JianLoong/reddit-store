I am a good cook but I don\u2019t enjoy it so we\u2019ve always just said I can\u2019t cook. We\u2019ve been married 3 years and this hasn\u2019t been an issue. \n\nMike and I have a daughter who\u2019s 5.

He said maybe just make a dish one time to have peace on Easter and I refused. \n\nSo AITA for pretending I couldn\u2019t cook for all these years?

We no longer live in a world of single income households where the wife has all day to cook and clean.

You can't diffuse this without caving in to their demands, which would be only for their sake and all you would get out of it was reduced criticism at best.

We help each other. I do it all the time, I don't want to help family and friends to pour concrete slabs, it's hard work and I'm doing it for free, but you bet your ass I'll be the first one there and the last to leave.\n\nMaybe if you guys could act like adults, the world would be a better place.", "Apparent illiteracy? Read the misogyny line again, several times, as many times as you need, until you can clearly understand it. \n\n \"Unless your husband and his family are misogynistic\" \n\nGee it sure looks like it says the HUSBAND and family", "Yep. Every chefologist knows that.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Unfortunately, the kid can't get herself there, and her father, whose family it actually is, won't deal with it, and will be working. If the family wants the daughter there, they can accept that they won't be bringing a dish. What they don't get to do is demand that OP bring her child around them on their terms.", "And what you honestly think they would like throw out a dish if their son who is the main cook in the house in the first place made it ? Lol", "I guess I just don't understand how catering to relatives' weird need for food food be cooked by someone with a vagina is an adult trait.\n\nAs an adult, I wouldn't want to expose my kids to people who would kick someone out of a family for not bringing a lady-made casserole.", "The fact that the husband isn\u2019t standing up for his wife or just cooking the food for HIS family\u2019s cookout is weird, and since he is instead just trying to pressure OP into cooking makes him one of the people placing the cooking solely on the women. He IS part of the problem in this specific instance. \n\nRead the post again, several times, as many times as you need, until you clearly understand it. Cause gee it sure seems like you aren\u2019t able to follow the conversation.", "So all the women make a dish except her, and she is called selfish. None of the men make a dish, and none of them are called selfish.\n\nYeah, okay. Nothing to see here.", "What about their weird need for men to do the manual tasks, either way, if it's food for a dinner, or helping fix a fence, I'll do it. \n\nMaybe you should do the same.", "Still hyper focused on that gender thing lol.", "If, say, her husband hated doing outside work and she was okay with doing it, but her family insisted that he help build the deck because it's men's work and he is a man...\n\nThat would be equally assholish and I would feel exactly the same.", "Nah, but you are. I literally posted one comment about it and you slid in with \"you keep trying to make it about gender\"", "It\u2019s clearly a gender-based tradition.", "You do realise, these things are ment to be a bonding experience right? But that's too much for you i guess.. I mean who would want to participate in family gatherings anyway? Just show up, eat and leave seems to be your way of life.", "Can\u2019t focus on anything else lol"]}
