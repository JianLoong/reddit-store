You\u2019re protecting your son\u2019s mental health. No one deserves that. Teens are especially sensitive to it, and especially as a teen who already struggles with mental health issues. Your son is dating another boy and struggling with body image issues. Those two things alone can be really hard on someone just from people at school and society in general. What he deserves from family is love and kindness. You\u2019re a good parent and I think your boundaries are entirely fair. \n\nYour mom is the A H.", "Kick her ass out. Don\u2019t allow anyone to mentally harm your child!", "NTA. Tell them to take her in and allow her toxic advice to wreak havoc on their children. And if they refuse, tell them you rest your case and no longer wish to discuss it. Then hang up. You\u2019re never wrong for defending your children!", "Your brothers are too busy to let her live with them but not too busy to get involved in this?\n\nNo they just don't want the headache that is your mother in their house and manipulating you into keeping her there\n\nYou're NTA but YWBTA if you don't kick your mother out if she ever says those things to your son again...she's an adult she can figure it out actions have consequences if she didn't want to be homeless she shouldn't have spewed venom as simple as that", "Tell them exactly why.\nShe is bullying (dont compromise on that word) your son, just like she did you. You wont compromise his well being for her, nor should you be expected to\nNTA", "Get her out of your house as soon as humanly possible!  Your son is your number one priority and he is being hurt by her.  You are NTA, but you will be if you do not protect your son.  I had to kick out my parents last year and know how hard it is, but I did what was right for my kids.  You can do this.", "NTA but she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong and she\u2019s gonna do it again. Guarantee 100%.", "Funny how they are too busy to deal with mom but not to busy to deal with the sister because she upset mommy\n\nNTA", "Tell mom that there are always nursing homes as an option if she can't be supportive of your son.", "This! If my mother talked to my kid like this, she\u2019d be gone. She hasn\u2019t changed in all of this time. She never will.", "NTA, and if they're so outraged, she can move in with one of them by Friday dinnertime. If they're not going to put up, they should shut up. But wait! Quick, do whatever you have to to get rid of her.", "1000% NTA. \nYour mom is an instigator and needs to leave. She's toxic to you and your son. \n Your brothers had better do their share here or as another redditor said drop mom off and run.", "No mother who sticks up for her son is TA. You are doing well and I hope you stick to your guns. Your son will love you for it,", "NTA. Your job is to look after your boy, not your mum. If she oversteps the boundaries and doesn't respect you or K, she should find somewhere else to live.", "NTA. I wish my parents were half the parent you are \ud83e\udd79", "YTA for not already kicking her out.", "kick her out now. NTA", "NTA. Wonderful of you to stick up for your son like that. Sounds like that conversation with your mom was a long time coming, and if the rest of your family doesn\u2019t like it, they can house her. Your house, your rules.", "Don\u2019t threaten, do. Do not have this woman around your son. Where she goes is not your problem. Protect your kid. That should be your only concern. You should have known what would happen and you know she isn\u2019t going to stop.", "Your mom seems like a jerk. Those comments should never have been made by her and they will honestly sit with him for a good long time. She needs to apologize, NTA.", "NTA.  I'm sorry your mother said those things to you, and sorry she is saying them to your child.", "She's already damaged your son.  Kick her out. \n\nNTA", "NTA. At all.\n\nShe's a monstrous cow.\n\nWhat she did to your boy is fucked up. I'm your boy grown up.\n\nI was that big kid no stuff confidence, no self esteem, hated my body. It fucked me mentally, because everyone can and is cruel. Kellan, hopefully is luckier than me by having a loving Ma and being able to be himself (I was a closet case till I was 23) and has a boyfriend who obviously sees something in him. \n\nI don't know the full situation with Kellan and his boyfriend, but if you have insight and without overstepping or bring that creepy mum, having a quiet word with boyfriend about Kellans self esteem and maybe he might be and to help Kellan see what he sees and you see.\n\nI know as a young gay kid (even closeted) my parents word wasn't nearly as weighted as a peer or a crush.\n\nAlso grandma needs to go into a fuckin home.", "NTA\n\nand i would tell your brothers you\u2019re not \u201cputting her out\u201d you\u2019re sending her to their house", "Nta, if she interpreted \"stop bullying my son or you're out\", as you're going to kick her out, then that means she has no intention of stopping.", "Love her rationale, he\u2019s going to lose his cute boyfriend if he\u2019s not skinny and fit except\u2026 the boyfriend chose him when he wasn\u2019t skinny and fit so he liked the son already, just as he was, not for what he could become.  Mom is a major AH and she needs to shut her mouth or get on out. Her \u201cadvice is unwelcome\u201d", "This! If they appeciate her advice so much they can have it 24/7.", "THIS^"]}
