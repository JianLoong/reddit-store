He decided to try out for wrestling last year and though I' didn't like it ,his dad was all for it and Kellan's therapist agreed it could be good for him and that he should do it as long as it's not affecting his mental health in a negative way.\n\nMy mom can't live on her own anymore and even though we don't have the best of relationships my brothers are to \"busy\" for her to stay with them.  So she moved in with us in January. Now Kellan hasn't been around my mom a whole lot because of how she was when I was a kid. Constantly  critiquing me and my body or  forcing me on diets and making comments about my weight etc..that caused me to develop an ED. She seems to have mellowed since then or so I thought. At first Kellan welcomed his grandma happily and they seemed to get along fine ,but over the last couple of weeks he seems to have withdrawn from her.\n\nI also noticed she'd sometimes ask about his weight class  or ask him how he got such a cute boyfriend which I' didn't like but  I thought were innocuous. Lately I've been seeing Kellan working out way more than usual and eating less.  Sunday night I found  in his old tree house crying and I asked what was wrong and he just blurted out that he thought his boyfriend was going to break up with him. Confused since his boyfriend seems to like him alot I asked why he thought and he told me that grandma said he needed to tone up or cute skinny boy like his boyfriend wouldn't stay with him for long. I was growing more pised by the second . I asked what else had she been saying and he told me alot of the same crap she used to say to me.\n\nI reassured him the best I could before he went to bed and then I confronted my mom. I told she could never talk to Kellan like that again. She got defensive saying she was just giving him good advice and I reminded her about all the crap her \"advice\"  put me through and told her to either quit or she'd have to live somewhere else. We haven't really talked since then, but I've been getting calls from my brothers and extended family about how I could say such a thing and threaten to put her out like that.
