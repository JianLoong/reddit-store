That fact alone fucks up A LOT of women, but your wife has the added issue of \"Must be the best to be worthy of her parents\".

They abandoned their child because she adopted. Your wife is becoming a mom without any of the parental guidance, support, and love she was probably hoping for.

For all your talk about her having been taught anything less than first place is bad, you're acting like you placed first in trauma and so none of hers matters.", "Full transparency- I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in a heteronormative relationship. \nSo what\u2019s going to happen when your daughter is struggling with thing that you, as a man, have never experienced? Are you going to look at her and tell her that she\u2019s on her own because you\u2019ve never had a period? Are you expecting your wife to take on the majority of raising your daughter because she will have an easier time relating? If yes, that\u2019s fucked and they deserve someone who wants to play a more active role in their lives. If no, then you need to do some introspection on why this is the issue you refuse to be empathetic about. YTA", "YTA\n\nWhen your pet died your wife said something very considerate. She acknowledged that she can\u2019t know exactly how you feel because she\u2019s never experienced it herself, but that she still has sympathy and empathy for your pain, that it must be hard for you. She validated your feelings. I bet you would have gotten REAL damn mad if she said \u201cI know exactly how you feel! Because xyz reason totally unrelated\u201d.\n\nIn response to her losing her relationship with her parents you said \u201cI don\u2019t care and can\u2019t support you\u201d. You denied her feelings, denied her support, and then came onto Reddit to write an essay about how your wife is just so privileged it\u2019s ridiculous she\u2019s hurt by ~checks notes~ her husband saying he doesn\u2019t give AF about her mourning the loss of your child\u2019s potential relationship with her parents.", "Yes.", "Despite her privileged background she's more sympathetic and caring than you.

And your example is bonkers, because she still COMFORTED you.  You didn't do shit, you just said you couldn't sympathize or relate.  Literally the opposite of what she said about your pet.", "YTA, she was compassionate when your pet died wtf do you mean", "\"I've never had a pet, but it must be hard\" is sympathy. She was saying that she didn't understand your loss, but she felt for you.\n\nWhat you said came off as bitter. It sounds like you resent the fact that she had a privileged life and are happy that she has to deal with things on her own now. You can still support her even if you don't understand. YTA", "YTA.\n\nThat dog comment was so underhanded.  Your family vs pet? Do better!\n\nDo we have to lay this out for you? Your wife can't have kids, that is a huge ordeal for her. That is trauma by itself. Then she adopts and her parents cut her out of their life.  Not just off, but out.  \n\nThere is a difference in not being able to understand the depths of what she must be going through as a man, but to be so cold about it is just wrong. \n\nNot understanding and not supporting are two different things.  You don't have to understand, comprehend or even experience it to be able to support her. \n\nYou are wrong. So wrong, I would suggest you crawl across the floor over broken glass to beg for forgiveness to prove to her that you are sorry.  These are the types of situations that end marriages.  \n\nShe is the reason you don't have a kid.  That is her thought. How do I know?  My wife has that same thought!  For you to be so cold-hearted hurt her more than you know.", "YTA - so your wife has never experienced unconditional love.  Any love her parents gave her was conditional on her achieving, doing exactly what they wanted and if she tried to withdraw, they turned on the emotional waterworks. And then she failed at the thing they wanted most - giving them new subjects to mold - and they cut her off totally. That's a huge loss - yes, relationship was transactional but she gets to mourn the might have beens.\n\nAnd now she's got another emotionally cold person in her life - who can't empathise with her because they didn't have exactly the same experiences.  And seems resentful that she experienced the affluent side of life without seeing all the downsides of having hyper-demanding parents. \n\nAt least, you got unconditional love from your pet. And it seems she tries to be supportive of you and other people.  She's never had that and it doesn't seem like she has it now.

This drives me nuts when people do this. Trauma and feelings of sadness are not finite resources. There\u2019s plenty to go around. Saying essentially \u2018I had it worse than you\u2019 does not negate her feelings. And honestly, her parents sound like assholes and she is well within her right to feel upset about the asinine reason they cut her off and refuse a relationship with their granddaughter. That must be awful. \n\nLearn how to have some empathy and stop trying to make hurt feelings into a competition.", "YTA. You sound petty, resentful, and self-centered. Your wife may have had a privileged life, but she clearly became a good person regardless, whereas you\u2019ve shown yourself to be the opposite. \n\nIt would probably help your marriage for you to apologize to her and work on developing some understanding, along with a healthy dose of empathy, for the woman you chose to marry.", "Yta", "When she said she never had a pet but it must be hard she was sympathising with you, even though she hadn't experienced it herself she could imagine it was hard, she understood. You basically said the opposite in this situation.\n\nAnd you know what, you of all people should be able to relate and understand, especially because you don't have parents. Have you never missed having parents? Just because she hasn't had to miss them for as long as you have doesn't make it less relatable.

YTA", "YTA, and the paragraphs of detail on how privileged your wife's life was were honestly irrelevant. Regardless of how rich or distant they were, it's still certainly a struggle to be estranged from one's parents.

You owe your wife a sincere apology.", "YTA seriously.. what you said and what she said are not even close to being equal in terms of support", "YTA you should be able to sympathize or empathize even if someone\u2019s experience is different from yours especially towards your spouse. I lost a parent very young and I am able to talk with people about issues with their parents without going eh but my parents are dead so I can\u2019t feel bad for yours doing something awful.

Do you dismiss anyone\u2019s emotions because they grew up privileged?", "Your best bet was to say im sorry honey this sucks\n\nNot compare childhoods or parents\n\nEven if you dont have sympathy you could have some damn empathy for her at not having parents around when you might know how that feels \n\nYou sound exhausting to be married to", "You need to express yourself better.  You can be supportive and sympathetic even when you don't fully understand or identify with a hardship.  You didn't make that clear and she may have felt betrayed.", "You\u2019re a prick", "YTA. Dude, do you really think that because she grew up with money she's not allowed to be sad about not having a relationship with her parents anymore? That's messed up.

She has every right to feel any kind of way about HER parents", "YTA, she sympathised, said \"it must be hard\", you didn't even do that, you don't always have to understand other people to support them. I was once in a group therapy session and some of the other stories just made me cry, such terrible childhood experiences, I told the therapist that I didn't feel like sharing mine because it just seemed so insignificant in comparison. The therapist said that we each have out own story, experience and the feelings relating to it, it's not a competition, and I was entitled to feel sad about my stuff.

What you said however was very rude and mean. You sound jealous and resentful that she had all these things you never had, so you're punishing her by insulting her.
