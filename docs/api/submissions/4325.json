That fact alone fucks up A LOT of women, but your wife has the added issue of \"Must be the best to be worthy of her parents\".

They abandoned their child because she adopted. Your wife is becoming a mom without any of the parental guidance, support, and love she was probably hoping for.

You didn\u2019t mean to, but you said something very hurtful. Even if they didn\u2019t financially support her, being abandoned by one\u2019s parents is definitely painful. You should apologize for speaking thoughtlessly and for hurting her.", "YTA.  Look at your example.  When you lost your pet she acknowledged that she could not truly understand but that she understood it was very hard for you.\n\nWhen she is reminded of her parents rejection and expresses it, you are quick to remind her you don't understand but you have no sympathy for her.  You don't even bother to acknowledge she's in pain, which is probably what she's responding to.", "YTA. In your pet example, that is the correct way to empathize with someone even if you haven't had the shared experience. In your example, you said you can't sympathize. There's a huge difference in the meaning.", "YTA I think the words you are looking for is empathize and not sympathize.", "What does money or privileged childhood have to do with any of this? She had to give up a relationship (however distant or transactional as it may have seemed to you) with her parents in order to have children. She was abandoned by her family who refuses to have anything to do with the life she is building with you. And you compared that to losing a pet.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be able to understand her pain to know she is in pain. What the heck? You come across as bitter and resentful of her for having parents at all. Just let her be sad and tell her you\u2019re sorry she\u2019s going through all of this.\n\nYTA", "YTA seriously? You really going to play the one up game on trauma? She's grieving the loss of her relationship with her parents. The people who have conditioned her her entire life.", "YTA. Do you even love her? You can learn to listen. Not everything is about you", "You are a raging asshole. Her comment about you losing your pet and your comment to her about her uobringing were NOT THE SAME at all\n\nWow. Just wow\n\nYTA", "Right? Sympathising with the person you love should be the easiest thing in the world. I don\u2019t understand why he even married her when he seems to resent her! Why do people marry people that they don\u2019t like?! I\u2019ve seen a lot of this on AITA recently. It\u2019s sad.", "If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in life (as a woman on the autism spectrum who basically feels like she spends 90% of her day studying human behavior lol), it\u2019s that people who are going through grief **DO NOT \u2014 under *any* circumstances \u2014 want to be told, \u201cI know exactly how you feel!\u201d** People feel incredibly invalidated when you try and say you\u2019ve been in their shoes; they want to express the uniqueness of their loss as it\u2019s happening *to them in that moment.* I feel like the pet comment was her way of trying to navigate this. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly know what you\u2019re feeling, but I know it must be awful.\u201d\n\nEdit: YTA for judgement", "It's Friday night and they're feeling shirty because they don't have dates!", "Because he's resentful that the money train stopped.", "Like it doesn't even sound like he likes his wife?", "idk why so many people on AITA just straight up do not like their partners it is insane to me", "it really doesn\u2019t. it sounds like he resents her for something out of her control. how do you blame someone for how they were raised? and how would he stay resentful of her upbringing knowing her parents love was conditional? it\u2019s messed up.", "Your last two paragraphs warmed my heart. I grew up in poverty with an unhealthy family and have always had to work very hard for everything I have. At one point, one of my friends from a similarly troubled family background with less financial struggles was saying they sometimes felt a bit guilty talking to me about the financial privileges they get. My jaw dropped and I immediately stammered \u201cno please don\u2019t feel bad! We\u2019re both getting traumatized, one of us should at least be getting something out of it!\u201d For some reason, that was the only way my brain could think to say that I\u2019m happy they don\u2019t have to go through the same struggle I\u2019ve gone through and it brings me joy to hear about things that have helped them and made them feel good.", "YTA. What you said and what she said are two different things. She empathized with you. You did not show compassion for her. You don\u2019t have to relate to show compassion.", "Yta.\n\nShe is like this because her parents raised her this way.\n\nYou decided to date, marry and adopt with her. Despite her lack of life skills.\n\nSo you had NO issues with that at all.\n\nSo removing that from the equation, all that is left is \u201cmy wife is sad, and I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAlso; not having parents and being abandoned by parents is two different life experiences. You can\u2019t compare the two. They both suck. But they suck in different ways. It\u2019s like if someone asked \u201cwe can either chop your leg, or your arm. Pick one\u201d it would suck, but life without a leg, is different then a life without a arm. One is not better or easier. You just have zero empathy for wife.", "YTA all the privilege stuff had nothing to do with your comment at all. It was mean. You are bitter about people having a relationship with their parents. Seek help.", "YTA\n\nThis is so weird of you, this is so very weird. What even made you think all that, do you hate her or something?", "Unpopular opinion but Nta. You don\u2019t understand her pain so you don\u2019t care. You don\u2019t know how to empathise with her and that\u2019s ok. Your word choice was wrong but that\u2019s it.", "YTA", "YTA. Don\u2019t compare traumas. Something that can be no big deal to you could be the end of the world for her. Don\u2019t belittle her feelings even if you don\u2019t agree. Even in arguments where I don\u2019t agree I still tell them their feelings are valid because that\u2019s how they are feeling.", " \nSo, your gf had a privileged upbringing that you seem to think makes her inferior, her parents cut her off for being infertile, about which she is completely understandably upset, and you, her partner, DGAF because you didn\u2019t like your own upbringing\u2026? \n\nYTA, and also, I\u2019m wondering about how your past may have made you very unempathetic.", "YTA. Question - do you even like your wife, the mother of your child and your partner you've committed to loving the rest your lives?\n\nACT LIKE IT.", "YTA\n\nDid you just try to make trauma into a sport of \"who had it worse\"? That's a shitty thing to do.", "YTA. You told her you can\u2019t sympathize with her. You basically told her you have no empathy for her feelings of sadness regarding her familial situation. She WAS sympathetic towards you saying even though she hasn\u2019t experienced the same lose of a pet, she can only image how hard it is. You basically said the opposite and wonder why she\u2019s made. Your wording is backwards, and intention and word placement matter to convey a specific meaning. You basically said you didn\u2019t care about her situation because you had it worse. Of course YTA", "Due to the misogyny, I wouldn't be surprised if OP's felt that was her only option for relief in an event she doesn't want in the first place, plus already knowing her husband is useless on the homefront. People view STAP (stay at home parent) as a full time job yet don't allow vacation time for the person who has become the default parent as a FT job. Weak effort to the husband and any other in his boat.", "You can't be serious. INFO- are you really fucking serious with this?", "Classic dude move lmao. YTA", "YTA. Like, you can still be kind and supportive to someone even if you have no personal experience of what they're going through.", "YTA-she at least pretended to care about your pet dying whereas you did not even pretend to care about her sadness.  Even if you don't have empathy. You should at least PRETEND to care.", "Sympathy is a human trait, but it\u2019s also partially a choice.  You can choose to let your own experience, or your perception of another\u2019s, assist your withholding of sympathy.  And that\u2019s what OP has done.  OP, you\u2019re totally TA.  Your wife deserves your understanding for her feeling of loss."]}
