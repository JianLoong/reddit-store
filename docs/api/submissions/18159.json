{"id": 18159, "submission_id": "13roo15", "title": "AITA for telling my husband I don't want him home for lunch?", "selftext": "I'm a stay at home mom with a 1 year old and my husband sometimes likes to come home for lunch. It's a hassle because at the time he has his lunch it is also our babies nap time, so you can imagine how annoying it can be when she's about to fall asleep but up she bounces when her dad comes through the door. It's even harder to put her down after he leaves because now she's grumpy and tired. Also he has an hour of lunch so it's 20 min to get home, 20 min to eat, then 20 min to drive back. He'll leave a mess taking out his lunch and dirtying the dishes and then it's up to me to clean up after him and sweep up the dirt from him boots. Which is even more annoying when I already finished cleaning that half of the house and now I have to do it again. I finally had it today when I had to mop the floor again in the kitchen after I told him it was wet and he got his muddy boots on it, he asked me why I was annoyed and I told him \"Why do you think I always pack a lunch for you? So you can have lunch at WORK\" He seemed hurt by this and just threw the rest of his food away, again caking mud on the floor I just mopped, and left. Ive cooled down since then and now I just feel like an asshole. So am I the asshole for feeling this way? Or am I the asshole for the way I chose to say my words?\n\n\nEdit: Me and my husband talked it out where I explained why I lashed out and apologized and also came to a compromise where on the days I \"Deep Clean\" he would instead stay at work and enjoy his 1 hour break. I only deep clean 2 days of the week so he still has 4 of those days to enjoy lunch with us. Although he also enjoys staying at work and watching his favorite shows on his phone while he eats. Again I enjoy having my husband for 20 min during lunch but on that 1 day I really need the baby to nap because it makes my day so much easier\n\nEdit: Guys he doesn't work 6 days a week he works a regular 40 hours.45 including his breaks. Also why are some people assuming I'm not grateful for my husband, I am, but I NOT going to grovel at his feet just because he's the only one working rightnow. I do ALOT of stuff around the house too, just because I don't get paid doesn't mean what I do isn't just as important. Also to the people saying I should be soooo LUCKY that my husband actually wants to see us and spend time with us? excuse me shouldn't EVERY husband be like this? I'm not going to praise something that should be the bare minimum. I love him with all my heart but I just won't.", "created_utc": 1685037724, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13roo15/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_dont_want_him_home/", "score": 2253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't get me wrong. But, it might be better to manipulate the circumstances and remove your obstacles, rather than have the war over something fixable. Ask him to remove his shoes before he comes in. Set up a little station to make that easy for him. And if he can't get used to the new support system, hand him the mop and tell him that messy boys get clean up duty.", "NTA\n\nIt's sort of ridiculous that despite this also being his home, he acts like an inconsiderate child. There's no way he can enter quietly? He can't take his boots off outside the door? He is incapable of noticing that he's creating a mess and apologizing for it or contributing to clean up? He has no sense of why naps are valuable for the rest and development of a 1 y.o.?\n\nIt sounds like you have *two* kids.", "NAH.  You\u2019re stressed, and it shows.  You have to have more communication with your husband.  Tell him you love that he wants to come home for lunch, but that he can\u2019t wake up the baby and make a huge mess.  I mean, seriously?? How does he not know that he is tracking mud everywhere?\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s wonderful that he wants to come home to be with you guys for a little while in his day.

It sounds like he wants to spend lunch you and your child. That is not a bad thing.", "Ehh your both kind of in the wrong. He should have enough self awareness to see the clean floors and smell the cleaner, and obviously pick up after himself. But I can understand him wanting to come home and see you even if it\u2019s just for a little while. Home is where we all reset and prepare for life again. But you also need to find a way to communicate in a non attack manner or he will never hear you\u2026 and this is not going to be a short convo either so don\u2019t try and have it then at lunch when there is a time crunch. Sit him down after work, explain what you do and how this is affecting you. There is compromise to be found here. Maybe it\u2019s something he can find a way to come in quieter or at a different time, change the cleaning schedule, heck leave his shoes outside.

He is allowed to decide he would rather eat at home instead of at work. He is allowed to come home any time because this is where he lives. \n\nYou can negotiate messiness and you should call him out on that. But you are really being unreasonable when you decide you can just be the doorkeeper on when he is allowed to come home.  You are kind of coming off pretty cranky and mean. YTA and I don\u2019t blame him for being hurt.  (He is the person you are supposed to love and be happy to see, remember? )", "YTA Jesus his working and you have a full time job too. Your job is the baby and the house. \n\nLet the man be a good father and see his kid.", "YTA he probably wants to come home sometimes because he misses you and his child. It sounds like you never communicated your issues with him prior to this incident. You need to sit down and have a conversation about how to make it work. Lack of communication is a relationship destroyer.", "ESH.  It's his house too.  That said, he should be more considerate about keeping the noise down and cleaning up after himself.", "YTA, but just barely. Not for being frustrated at the disruption that comes from him coming home, but for snapping at him. If someone had said that to me I'd be hurt too. He's going out of his way (driving 40 minutes) to get home to see you and your daughter, probably because he wants to spend time with you. It's understandable that you'd be frustrated at the extra work this makes for you. Talk with him about how to minimize the disruption to your daughter's routine and taking his boots off.", "Eh YTA just because it seems like you never even hinted at having this conversation and then blew up at him. Dudes in a rush and probably forgets to take off his boots sometimes so ask him to OR you know he\u2019s coming home so just wait to clean? And he dirties some dishes, why can\u2019t you just let them sit till he gets home? He comes home from lunch to see his wife and daughter and only has 20 minutes so he\u2019s probably rushing and flustered and now you just chewed him out for it.", "YTA for not kindly communicating with him before you blew up at him. He wanted to spend more time with you and the baby, sacrificed a 40 minute commute each day just to spend 20 minutes with you, and probably thought you liked/appreciated the effort he was making. This could have been a compassionate and loving conversation where you explained how him coming home for lunch disrupts the baby\u2019s schedule. You could have brainstormed a solution together. But the way you did it was an AH move, and you owe him a heartfelt apology and a calm discussion - the one you should have had in the first place.", "YTA but just slightly. Your frustrations is understandable, but you should have talked to him earlier, rather than explode. Just sit done with him and find a solution. Tell him what bothers you and find a compromise which works for both of you.", "YTA - I get it, having the nap delayed when you are tired is frustrating. But\u2026 you both get such a ruthlessly short amount of time with your kid. You have a husband that wants to come home and be with his wife and kid. It is a gift that he is both able and wants to do so. So maybe let\u2019s lean into that.\n\nMy advice is, switch things up. Turn these into moments. Have a goofy lunch. Turn the music up and dance and sing together with your kid. Play silly games together. Make these moments as happy as possible for all of you, because many of us wish we lived close enough to do this and get one more hour with our family a day. So go maximize the opportunity.\n\nThis will absolutely send him back to work on cloud 9 with a smile on his face and love for you and the kid pouring out of his heart, and you will have the same full heart and smiles while being left with a tired child that is ready for a nap.\n\nIf he can\u2019t make it every day, set aside that time for goofy lunch time so that it becomes your kid\u2019s routine to have a blast with Mommy or Mommy and Daddy, then go crash giving Mommy her well deserved break.\n\nI mean who doesn\u2019t want a routine of a goofy family time every day.", "You seem like a tired mom who wants this hour as a break and I get it. I think the delivery was a bit harsh, BUT I\u2019d like to say I can understand why you feel the way you do! \n\n40 minutes of commute time during the lunch hour seems excessive and I\u2019d request he not even bother. It\u2019s lovely he wants to see you. But the extra chaos it causes you and the disruption to the nap hour should be taken into consideration.", "You are NTA for feeling overwhelmed.\n\nYour husband, however, is a steaming pile of asshole, especially for making a BIGGER mess for you to clean.  That's childish.\n\nBut, as in all things, use your words.  And be an adult while you're doing it.", "YTA - you are angry about the effects of him being home and telling him his presence is unwanted when what you can instead 1) ask him to take off his boots before coming inside and 2) shift your babys schedule by 20 minutes so that she isn't napping for the 20 minutes he can spend with her.\n\nHe is coming home to his family.   He has a bouncing 1 year old daughter that changes every day and he doesn't want to miss it.  He has food, he doesn't come home for that.", "YTA for not kindly communicating with him before you blew up at him.

You held it in till you snapped. Ask him to take of his shoes", "YTA. When your husband no longer wants to come home or spend time with you, you can track it right back to this moment because you made him feel like utter crap for doing so. Most women would kill for a man that wants to come home middle of the day to see them and their kid. Appreciate what you have before you lose it", "YTA. You're acting like your husband is an inconvenient, unwanted guest in your and your daughter's home. He is out at work for hours every day and misses out on so much while your daughter is a baby. You are working at home on cleaning and raising your daughter, which have become your main focus. It isn't your husband's main focus, though. He might not notice or care if the house hadn't been deep cleaned one week, he just wants to be at home to see his wife and baby and hear what you've been up to. It's completely ridiculous that he thinks it's in any way acceptable for him to be earning muddy boots in the house, but surely a simple conversation would stop this? Or a dirt-trapping door mat? Or wait until your baby is asleep to mop the floors, if you're doing them anyway? Or leave it for your husband to clean when he gets home. You both just seem to have very different views of his lunchtime visits and it needs a proper conversation. It's not nice to treat him as an inconvenience in his own home, though.", "YTA He comes home to have lunch with you and ok, he makes a mess, that can be worked out \"take your boots off please\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not everyday and I know you're busy with the baby but he's making an effort to spend time with you when he could easily get a full hour lunch at work.", "YTA, it is his house as well and he has every right to come home for lunch.  You could give hime rules around it, that would be fair.", "NTA tell him to take the fucking boots off, that's common courtesy.", "NTA. id set up boundaries if he wants to come home for lunch. \n\n1 being shoes must be off before he comes inside or he has to wear plastic bags on top of them(saw hes insecure about his stinky feet? Maybe try an antifungal cream or something as well)\n2 enter quietly so as to not disturb the babys nap\n3 must clean up dishes/ put in dishwasher / use disposable plates and throw away before he heads out\n\nThat would be a fair compromise I think. I hope he is willing to ease the burden off you by doing these things.. being a mom to little ones is hard!", "YTA", "I would think some pretty small adjustments would solve all of these issues.  You stay home and he is saving money as well as spending time with his family?  Count yourself lucky, there are so many other things he could choose to do with his lunch hour.", "I think if you'd had a direct conversation about this before you were this irritated, you probably would have been able to express things more kindly. But your feelings are valid. Stop cleaning up a second time, though; leave it for him to deal with when he gets home (also leave him with the grumpy child who didn't get a nap, and go out for coffee. Maybe he'll better understand the problem.)", "Nta. You guys need to talk.", "NTA why is he not cleaning up after himself? That's not fair. It's ridiculous that he tracks mud into the house. Why can't he come quietly and not disturb his child? He's being a selfish jerk.", "We should honestly or we can just compromise on him not coming over on the days I deep clean, as I wouldn't mind him coming over on regular days where me and the baby ate just relaxing. And he has to take his lunch at the same time everyday", "He doesn't like to take his shoes off until he showers as he's insecure about his stinky feet.\nHe likes seeing us in the middle of his day as he says it makes his day go by faster .\nYes he has lunch at the same time everyday but he only tells me when he's coming an hour before.\nI like to do the house in a certain order idk why.\nAnd I can do that but she gets grumpy if her nap doesn't come at her time. \n\nAnd I tell him but I'm not sure it sticks.", "He has to have lunch at the same time everyday and it can be adjustable depending on when she wakes up in the day but I was just stressed out as cleaning days can be hard with a toddler", "Honestly that's really helpful too", "Yes I always tell him to clean up after himself but he just forgets or says he has to go because he's in a rush", "Yeah someone exciting coming home right before nap is really hard to get past. I sympathize that he wants to come see his family mid day but it sounds really disruptive to the routine. I do think some modification of the routine could happen but I sympathize with those days when you REALLY need the kid to nap and now they aren\u2019t going to.", "I know....deep cleaning days are just a bit more stressful than others and I guess I lashed out at him more than I should have", "Why does he even have to walk around the house with muddy shoes! He can take them off before getting inside", "You're right, I think everything piling up has taken a toll on me lol. I used to work alot before I had a baby and now that I'm a stay at home mom it can be DRAINING.

Since having the baby I have such a short temper and it's something I need to work on", "He could take off his boots when he comes inside like a normal person, tbh", "How about putting a pair of shoes by the door to change into. That way, he's not tracking mud in.", "He needs house shoes and a place to sit and change shoes right by the door. House shoes can be any shoe that doesn't leave the house, just in case your picturing mamaws fuzzy slip ons lol. My husband uses a pair of Crocs.", "If he doesn't want to change his boots, they make cheap, disposable shoe coverings. Contract workers use these all the time when working in people's houses.", "Maybe after your outburst it's now easier for him to remember that he's sometimes causing you extra work.\n\nI think this is a NAH situation - it's sweet that he drives 40 extra minutes a day just to see you, but I understand why you're unhappy about it. I hope you can resolve this with a compromise, like he stays at work on deep cleaning days, even though he could arrange to come home on one of those days. And would he be ok with you putting your daughter to sleep before he arrives? I guess if that would be possible for you, it would be better than for her to stay awake while he's there.", "If his feet smell you can get shoe spray for his boots or he can use foot powder before he puts them on.", "Maybe a signal would work! Code word to text him when naps are struggle bus; or he texts you and comes home depending your reply (on how the day is going). \n\nBe sure you share with him the extra pain and work this adds to your day. If he wants to come home during sleep time, he should be open to the compromise.", "You are not his mother.

Specifically a day you do not leave it pristine at the start.", "NTA. I may be downvoted but I didn\u2019t  want my partner home for lunch when I had my babies.  It became more work for me.  I think maybe 2 or 3 days out of 5 would be ok to come home for lunch. Also It\u2019s important  for them to socialize with colleagues at work as well.", "NTA\n\nWTF doesn't he just start taking off his boots so he doesn't track stuff around the house? I don't care if it is a deep cleaning day or not. It would take very little time. \n\nHe can also use disposable dishes, minimize dishes he uses or clean what he uses.\n\nI guess he mainly comes home to see the two of you. It is annoying about tge baby's nap but if he wasn't creating other work for you maybe it wouldn't be so bad.", "Honestly, nah. You shouldn\u2019t have blown up but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired.

On the other hand, your husband WANTS to get as much time as possible with his family. As you kind of pointed out, he\u2019s spending more time driving than with you so that definitely means something. \n\nSounds like a date night might be in order if you haven\u2019t had one in a while. Take the opportunity to get some time just the two of you, talk about how you recognize that he is inconveniencing himself when a lot of people wouldn\u2019t and also express how you\u2019re feelings about his actions vs naming what he\u2019s doing as wrong. Then together, brainstorm solutions for each issue you face. So shoes - take them off and uses house shoes and then baby - can he message to check on her mood and if it\u2019s a good idea to come home? Maybe he can adjust the time her comes to be a bit better for her current schedule, etc.", "This is why people say choose discomfort over resentment.

I am a dad and WFH and use Friday to clean, and as soon as everyone gets home it gets undone. But, it hurt to read how you reacted, can only imagine what it feels like to receive it.
