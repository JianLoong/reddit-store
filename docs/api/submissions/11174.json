Both of you need to learn to grow up and act like adults when in public. Seriously.", "NTA Apparently she didn't tell the friend the whole story. I would have left too. Tell her to grow up and get over herself.", "NTA But I would never eat in public with her. I would probably re-evaluate being with someone like that", "ESH.

You need to communicate better.\n\nAnd no you don't have to take her to another restaurant lol, after her dramatic actions I wouldn't blame you if you never took her out again.\n\nYou should try telling her if she does something you don't like, rather than just leaving the scene.

You actually deserve each other. Please do the rest of the dating pool a favor and reconcile.", "ESH\n\nYou two have to be over right?

They are probably looking after multiple tables and dealing with their own stuff. They don't need to be hassled by someone who is too childish to just push the food aside or order something else.

Picky eaters are automatically the asshole", "This didn\u2019t happen.", "YTA.\n\nWhy even bother having a girlfriend, if it's going to be like this?\n\nBut you do have a girlfriend, so you need to own it. Either break up, or hang in there. Don't do this half assed passive aggressive yes but no bullshit.", "ESH, can\u2019t tell who is worse.", "YTA for leaving her there, that\u2019s just wrong.

Nah.  \n\nShe embarrassed herself acting like an idiot. \n\nYou kind of embarrased yourself by ditching her but again, you might be young, or you might have been SO freaked out yourself that you just bolted to get away from it.  \n\nWhy should you take her to another restaurant? What's the guarantee this won't happen again?  \n\nThis just reconfirms to me that 'picky eater' is the worst thing parents can tolerate in their kids.", "Pay the bill.
