I\u2019m half caucasian half Middle Eastern (far more brown than white though) and she is caucasian. We have been dating for over half a year now and a month or two ago I met her family at a gathering. All was going well until we went back to their house with some extended family and while all cracking jokes her dad said to me \u201cI heard you might have a gun on you?\u201d To which I said \u201cwho told you that?\u201d \n\nMy GF wasn\u2019t in the room and her two cousins were with us and told him to stop being an asshole, which stopped it all there. After my girlfriend returned I told her the weird incident and didn\u2019t really think too much into it\u2026 she then took me somewhere private and told me that when we first started dating she was telling her family all about me at another gathering and her father said \u201coh yeah how\u2019s that Ni***r of yours getting on?\u201d Apparently the whole family was shocked and just stayed silent for a few minutes.\n\nI obviously felt very uncomfortable and unsafe in that house but kept trying to understand why it was said and prompted her further\u2026 she told me that he said he liked me in the bar and that she thinks he\u2019s very ignorant and that he\u2019s very uneducated (didn\u2019t finish school and works as a trade). As someone who studied psych I get this and understand that racism is learnt not innate.\n\nAfter that incident I said I\u2019m not comfortable being there and don\u2019t plan on going to her families house again for a long time. I was even tempted splitting up and openly had a conversation about this with her because my kids are going to be mixed race and that is the grandfather they\u2019re ultimately going to have. Upon reflection I also recall her sister and one of her cousins asking at random points of the night \u201cI see you met *the dad*, how was that?\u201d And I said \u201cyeah it was fine, why?\u201d To which they both went \u201coh, he\u2019s just very awkward like\u201d.\n\nFast forward to today and she\u2019s saying she wants me to go to her family house at some point over the Christmas but I am opposed to being in the same room as her dad never mind staying under his roof. She said it was a bit unfair and that\u2019s quite one sided since she\u2019s thinking of potentially moving home. I told her I\u2019d make the effort to travel to wherever closest to her but just not anything to do with her dad. She has since apologised and said she didn\u2019t mean to pressure me and it\u2019s completely understandable to not want to go to her parents house but that it\u2019s upsetting.\n\nObviously in an ideal situation I\u2019d more than love to go to my girlfriend\u2019s parents house for Christmas to socialise with siblings and what not. However, given the circumstances I really feel uncomfortable doing so. I\u2019m not looking to validate my feelings but am I being irrational or should I just suck it up and maybe avoid him at family gatherings and hope he becomes less ignorant?", "created_utc": 1701687899, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ahx8l/aita_for_not_wanting_to_associate_with_my_gf/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here's a possible plan. Tell your GF that you'll come, but that this will be a test-ride of your relationship with her and with her family. IF he acts abominably, IF nobody calls him out, IF nobody defends you, if SHE doesn't call him out, or if SHE doesn't defend you, then you two have some hard choices to make about the future of this relationship.  And tell her that if he becomes truly unbearable and insulting, you will leave early, and that you will be very disappointed if she does not leave with you.  \n\nBasically, you give her the opportunity to do the right thing.", "NTA\n\nOf course it is totally reasonable for you to avoid staying with someone who uses racist language about you, both to your face and behind your back.  That in itself must be incredibly hurtful and distressing, and there is always that worry that someone with bigoted views towards you could escalate their behaviour into something worse.  I can\u2019t imagine that many people would be happy to put up with that treatment for any reason so no reason why you should.\n\nI\u2019m not going to say that your GF is the AH here because she is in an incredibly difficult position and seems to be genuinely trying her best to support you.  Sure, in an idealistic world she would make some big public stand against her dad\u2019s racism and his general treatment of you, but in reality, family situations make that kind of act incredibly challenging, especially as she is currently living with him.\n\nThe father on the other hand is 100% the AH - his background is no excuse, plenty of \u201cold-school\u201d working class people with less formal education are able to get over these attitudes and accept others regardless of race etc.  The fact that the rest of her family were shocked by his words also indicates that he\u2019s spent plenty of time around others who don\u2019t share his views, so it\u2019s not like racism is all he\u2019s ever known, either.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next for you and your GF, I honestly hope you can make it work, but either way you are entirely not the A.", "NTA. She should talk to her father about his terrible behavior. You could go one last time. If he has not changed one bit, that's it.", "You\u2019re NTA at all. But consider you might be what changes the opinion of this racist. That isn\u2019t your responsibility, by any means but consider he may not have had exposure to people who look differently than him. It\u2019s not an excuse but it is reality. I\u2019d personally go but I\u2019d expect your GF to shut him down if he says anything offensive. If he continues, I\u2019d leave.", "NTA. It is perfectly understandable to not be around racist people. And if its going to be an issue longterm then it may be best to end it now. You should have a really serious talk about it with your GF.", "NTA he's terrible", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t go if I were in your shoes, and relieved your gf apologized to you.", "NTA at all. I'd also tag on, if noone has called the dad out for his racism they are as bad as he is. \nIf your gf is still willing to see her dad let alone ask you to be around him after him calling you N word I'd be breaking up. You deserve better", "NTA.  Don't subject yourself to his nonsense.", "Nta, but dude one thing. Dont have kids with this woman. No kid deserves a racist grandparent.", "Even though your FIL is an obvious AH I do think YTA\n\nFamily is part of the package. You may feel you don't want to be part of that package (and your concern with possible future children is very valid). But if you feel that's a deal breaker, then break up.

I mean, she clearly wants to have a relationship with her father, and you clearly don\u2019t. That\u2019s a pretty big obstacle for your relationship to overcome. \n\nI\u2019m white, so let me preface by saying I\u2019ll never fully understand what this must be like for you, but would it help to get an apology from her father? Would you be willing to give him the opportunity to grow? You say it yourself, racism is learned behavior. And not that you have to teach him otherwise, but is it not then possible for him to learn acceptance and love (I wanted to write tolerance but that feels not quite right)?\n\nRegardless, you\u2019ll have to look at your relationship with your girlfriend and decide what the best path forward is. Because if you decide to continue and move this relationship along, there will come times you\u2019ll likely have to see him. I mean, she\u2019ll likely want him at her wedding. Or even her engagement party (idk if that\u2019s common other places than the US). She\u2019ll probably want him around when/if she has kids some day. \n\nIt\u2019s something that you two will undoubtedly fight about if you don\u2019t try to resolve it now. And if she cares about you, she\u2019ll be willing to confront her father and challenge him to be better.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s ironic she accused you of being one sided for not wanting to go to her house since she\u2019s thinking of moving home with her racist father. She expects you to just expose yourself more to his blind hatred for her sake. Would she do the same if it were your family treating her that way, or would you ask her to? You shouldn\u2019t have to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Once was enough.", "NTA, and red flags from the GF.  No ages are giving, but if she's moving back in with him the guy is going to unavoidable and potentially looming over every meet up.", "No future.", "NTA\n\nBut this is going to be hard thing to maneuver. She cannot choose her dad, and the rest of the family seemingly is not like that, too. But her dad is still her dad, even if jmhe has some MAJOR flaws (to put it polite). Some peoole already suggested how to prepare and communicate in advance and what boundaries to put up. I think these are good tips.", "The dad is AH we all know that.\n\nGF is AH cause indifference.\n\nYour comment about being uneducated and didn\u2019t finish school and works a trade.  To which you agree, YTA.", "Yeah, I think giving her notice as well as the dad another chance for change might even be a possible outlook on it. Who knows, I could be the one to change this old man\u2019s views (not that I should have to of course).", "Yeah, I\u2019ve dealt with enough of that in the past and obviously avoid putting myself in those situations where possible.\n\nShe is genuinely trying her best and tries to be very apologetic and approach each conversation honestly and as open as possible.\n\nAs you say, families are complicated as her mum and siblings seem lovely and she\u2019s even confronted her dad about both instances telling him that he has to change his ways and nearly cost her a healthy relationship.", "She brought it up to her dad and family after the event and told him he nearly cost her the relationship because of his ways. I may give it one more chance and see if there\u2019s any change.", "That\u2019s the thing, I know for certain he\u2019s had limited exposure to people different than him as he\u2019s a rural man and has always been such with limited travelling or experience. \n\nOf course as you said it\u2019s not my responsibility to bear such a task but it could be a chance for positive change. Especially when my relationship is incredibly healthy otherwise. If not, as you said there\u2019s a clear answer.", "I\u2019ll be having another serious talk about it regardless of if I do decide to go.", "She\u2019s very understanding and always willing to communicate and have open conversations about things. She brought it up to her dad and family after the event and told him he nearly cost her the relationship because of his ways.", "This is very true, aside from her cousins on the night of the gun comment I\u2019m not sure if anyone else said anything the previous time. Unfortunately families are complicated and despite her not liking her own dad she does like her mother and siblings so he\u2019s bound to be there.", "This is true. I woupd not want to put them through that.", "Fingers crossed. But don't hold your breath. The most he'll do is categorise you as the exception to the rule:  \"All of *them* are bastards except my Son in Law, he's one of the few good ones\"", "Wow did he feel bad or have anything to say to that?", "As harsh as this sounds, she is now an adult in an adult relationship. If she's not willing to defend you on something like this which is black and white then she never will :/"]}
