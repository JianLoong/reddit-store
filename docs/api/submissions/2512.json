We\u2019ve had a ton of ups and downs but we are trying to work through things. Just a quick background, in this 5 years we have never met each other\u2019s kids, family or friends. Literally no one significant in each other\u2019s lives (his rule until we fix our issues). I\u2019m also blocked off all his social media after I tagged him in a post 4 years ago. So even though he tells me people know we\u2019re together, I can only take his word for it. \n\nSo back to the story. He\u2019s a Real Estate Agent and there is this one single woman who I feel he has talked about way more often than other clients. To be fair, she has made this a little more of a difficult process due to her father fronting her the cash and having to have a say in everything. In the last month we argued over her because he was talking about her drinking habits on our way to a date and I got jealous and made a comment it was a weird thing to know about a client. Then today he calls me and I step away from work and he tells me he\u2019d been at her house the last hour helping her move things from her garage to the uhaul. He actually didn\u2019t even say her name, just that he was helping the client whose house closes on Friday move their things. When I realized who it was, I told him I that was a weird thing to be helping a client with. He said she had contacted him late last night because everyone bailed and asked him to help. According to him, two other guys were there \u201cbut not helping as much\u201d. I explained I felt uncomfortable and he got upset because I am \u201ctoo jealous\u201d and this is something that\u2019s normal. \n\nSo AITA for being jealous?

Boy must have a PIECE on him.", "NTA \n\nOp please run because you are not in a relationship you are in an affair!!", "NTA but I would officially have to label you as \"The other woman.\" Run... And run fast.", "Info: Is this real?", "NTA. Op, are you sure you're not \"the other woman\" in this guy's life? He's kept you secret for 5 years. This is all you will ever be to him.", "FIVE years?!\nNTA but you\u2019re the side piece", "Oh sweetie, you're the side piece.", "How are people this gullible? Are you kidding me?? ESH and also YTA for falling for that shit", "OP you're NTA, and your BF is but it has nothing to do with his client.  I hate to break it to you, but you are the side piece.  \n\nBreak up and go have a real real relationship with someone who actually wants to share their life with you", "YTA, it\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019re his mistress, if you\u2019re going to ignore such an obvious sign your man doesn\u2019t see as as his girl, then you have no business getting upset he isn\u2019t treating you like a partner\u2014 because you two clearly aren\u2019t in a relationship. \n\nAnd just a piece of advice for future relationships\u2014 if you haven\u2019t met ANYONE in his life in the first few months, leave.", "Info have you been to their house/apartment?

So lots. \n\nFollow up Is that house appropriately lived in, and appropriately priced for someone at his income level.  Are there pictures of him, are the cabinets full, Is there a junk drawer? Or does it look like an Airbnb.  \n\nPsst cuz it's fairly easy for a realtor to have a spare apartment, that their wife might not know about. It's almost expected that a realtor has an investment property after years.", "I hate to break it to you, but you are, at best, his f\\*\\*\\* buddy. You are not, nor will you ever be, his girlfriend.

Like it's so bizzare that she'd be totally ok with this.", "I mean she\u2019s probably his girlfriend - alongside his other girlfriends and/or wife and kids. \n\nI often roll my eyes at AITA/Reddit in general going from 0 to 100 with red flags and such but I can think of no reason to be blocked on his social media for tagging him other than \u201cshit, gotta hide her.\u201d \n\nLikewise you have been together for FIVE YEARS and have never met/even talked to his friends and family? Oh hell no. You are being hidden and I\u2019m pretty sure the reason you\u2019re not meeting his kids is so that they don\u2019t tell mommy about meeting dad\u2019s new friend that he seemed close to.", "He has not met OP's \"people\" either. This sounds like he is married, and afraid that if he meets OP's friends and family, one of them may already know him.", "Right? If the issues are lasting years, then that\u2019s a red flag. \n\nI\u2019m torn because him helping the client is nice of him and shouldn\u2019t be causing jealousy.

After 5 years, it just doesn't make sense that you have not met his family and you're blocked on social media. Men's know what they are doing and they know who are the ones that they can control. You're definitely one of them. Why don't you give him an ultimatum, tell him you want to meet his family and friends this year for Christmas. If he loves you as he says, he will introduce you to them for the first time. I 100% guarantee you that he will get angry at you and guilt trip you. Saying you both aren't doing good yet, why do you want to meet his family for? Or why are you trying to ruin something that is already good ATM. He will say whatever he can to make you feel bad, trust me.", "What did his house look like? How about the bathroom? How many times have you been there? Just in an out or actually spend time there?\n\nBecause he's definitely hiding you and I'm kind of stunned it's been five years of it.", "OP, you are the other woman even if there isn't another woman.

Didn\u2019t even think of that.", "And I covered you. :)", "happy cake day!", "you need to put spaces in like N T A or the bot will read it as your judgement", "Or \"Hey X, I saw your husband at a cookout this weekend. Who was the lady with him, and where were you and the kids?\"", "One of our local realtors bought a box truck, had her photo put on it, along with a message that if you buy from her, you can use the truck to move. \n\nNot the same, but you reminded me of this.", "My aunt's realtor helped her move in an emergency.", "Right? Like I had a coworker as my realtor and they didnt even help me.", "Realtors go above and beyond in my experience. On the closing day of Buying our new house, the Sellers still had so much to move out before the walk through. So you bet their Realtor was literally moving boxes into their truck. It took all day. We ended up closing after 5pm.", "Mine did", "It's honestly not that weird. It doesn't specifically come up often that it's needed, but lots of realtors will go above and beyond to help their clients on closing day. But he's definitely married.", "That would make sense. Back when I was single, when I hung out with married or engaged men they did have a habit of venting about their significant other.", "Another thing about that timeline confuses me\u2026 if it\u2019s been 5 years and you haven\u2019t met anyone, once you tell them at what point can you move in together, get engaged or married?

Haven\u2019t been on since those were posted and having those comments still attached we\u2019re just weird to see.

I hadn\u2019t even noticed!! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf70", "That makes way more sense though- turn it into a marketing tactic. OP's boyfriend ain't selling the same thing", "Emergency being the key word", "That's because his clients made him look bad lol, not because realtors are supposed to help their clients move. Mine bought me a tv wall mount when the guy I bought from took his with and wasn't supposed to", "Ah. I see\nWell good luck with him. Trust your gut", "OP's boyfriend is someone else's husband.", "Fair enough. Don't get me wrong, Op's \"bf\" is full of shit for sure.", "I mean, to be fair what is described in the post sounds like an emergency though", "100%. I had exactly one boyfriend block me on social and it took me about 45 seconds to figure out he was cheating", "Lol no it doesnt", "Yup, been there", "Lol expecting people to help you move only to have them cancel late last minute is definitely an emergency. I would freak out.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to defend him, but like I don\u2019t think him helping his client move in an emergency is the issue here...", "Hire movers. It's not the realtor's problem.", "An emergency for a realtor to help that I would find normal is an actual emergency like someone escaping domestic violence. People cancelling sucks but that is not an emergency. She has a dad - with money. Movers were entirely an option", "You\u2019re changing your stance lol. \u201cHire movers\u201d could be the response to any emergency.\n\nAlso realtors like having repeat clients. It\u2019s not crazy to go above and beyond when you are providing a service for this very reason.", "I\u2019m sorry this scenario makes zero sense. In what world would your realtor be involved directly in escaping an abusive situation? Selling your home isn\u2019t something done in secrecy. It\u2019s a process that\u2019s pretty obvious to everyone living there. Moving dates are calendared for everyone."]}
