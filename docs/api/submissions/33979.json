{"id": 33979, "submission_id": "18tlzla", "title": "WIBTA if I take my nephew to Disney World but not his parents?", "selftext": "Throwaway account.  Names changed to protect the (not-so-) innocent.  I'm 39M, my wife is Anna (39f) my kids are Amy (9f) and Connie (7f).  My sister is Laura (37f), her husband is Ken (36m), and their son is Aiden (6m).\n\nI'm planning to take my kids to Disney world next year for Amy's 10th birthday.  While discussing plans for the trip, Anna and I thought we might offer to take Aiden with us.  Amy and Connie get along well with Aiden, and he's never been.  I'm not sure if Aiden will get the chance to go otherwise.  Laura and Ken don't have a ton of money.  They don't lack for necessities, but they don't have much disposable income beyond that.\n\nWhen I brought this up with Laura she was super excited at first.  She told me they'd love to go with us.  I told her that I'd be happy to have the whole family along but I was only offering to pay Aiden's way.  She got pissed at that.  She said it was unfair for me to take him without them because they'd miss out on getting to enjoy those special moments with their son.  She said I was was lording my money over them and trying to buy their son's love.  \n\nWhere I might be a bit of an asshole here is that I view Laura and Ken's financial situation as voluntary.  Laura makes pretty decent money as an engineer, but Ken has never worked.  Not before Aiden was born, not after Aiden started school.  He has a college degree, he has no disabilities, he just chooses not to work.  I don't understand it, but at the end of the day it works for them and it's really none of my business, so I've never said anything to them about it.  But I do see their money problems as self-inflicted and because of that I choose not to help them out financially a lot of the time even if I could afford to.  \n\nAnyway, I got kind of mad at Laura saying I'm lording my money over them and trying to buy their son's love.  I told her it's not my fault that they can't afford to go to Disney world and that I \\*thought\\* I was doing something nice by taking Aiden with me.  If I thought she was going to get mad at me for offering to do something nice I would never have offered in the first place.  Laura said I'm putting her in an impossible situation since if Aiden ever found out he could have gone to Disney World and she didn't let him he'd never forgive her.  I said that was her problem and the offer to take Aiden (and only Aiden) still stood.\n\nAnna doesn't thing I'm wrong, but she thinks to keep the peace we should just take the whole family.  We could afford to if we stretched things a little bit.  I see it as I'm already offering to do something extremely generous and that Laura and Ken are just trying to take advantage of me.  Will I be the asshole if I stand firm and only pay Aiden's way?", "created_utc": 1703852648, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tlzla/wibta_if_i_take_my_nephew_to_disney_world_but_not/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister seems to be taking her resentment towards her financial situation (and possibly her husband) out on you.\n\nAs to not wanting to miss out on this experience with her child...I get it, but I'm not a fan of that mentality.\n\nMy sister and her husband pull that shite all the time. They didn't want us to take the kids skiing because THEY wanted to do it. They didn't want us to watch Stars Wars, or Wizard of Oz or a dozen other films because THEY wanted to do it. They didn't want us to read Harry Potter to them because THEY wanted to do it.\n\nProblem is they're both workaholics and, even when they spend two nanoseconds with the kids, they're ALWAYS absorbed in their phone/laptop the whole time.\n\nThe kids have SAID they enjoy watching movies with us more because we actually enjoy the experience with them.\n\nSome parents are just plain selfish. It's as simple as that.", "My son got the opportunity to go with a friends family when he was in grade school. He had never been before. I was thrilled he got the chance to go, and never ONCE did I think I should have been invited as well. He had a blast. The actual entitlement of your selfish sister is beyond the pale.", "I\u2019d say NTA with caution. I would just say that you should reflect on this and consider how you would feel or think if the roles were reversed and Laura did not work. Just because he\u2019s a SAH dad doesn\u2019t make it different from a SAH mom.", "NTA.\n\nWhen I was 10, my Auntie took me to Disney World. Mum decided she'd like to come to and paid for herself.", "Ooooof.\n\nESH.  \n\nYou\u2019re not the AH for wanting to offer to pay for your nephew\u2019s trip.  But, at 6 years old, he probably won\u2019t remember most of it later anyway. You absolutely should not pay for your sister and her husband way to Disney World. The way you offered to invite them though sounds like it was a little confusing and I feel like you should\u2019ve probably said hey we\u2019re thinking of paying for only Aiden\u2018s way to Disney World. What are your thoughts on this instead of just however, you said it. However you invited the Nephew lead your sister in a way to think that they were invited. She sucks for trying to make you feel guilty about not giving them a free vacation. The whole idea that if the kid ever found out, he could\u2019ve gone to Disney World and didn\u2019t get to go. It\u2019s just nonsense and that\u2019s just a way for her to guilt trip you. Quite frankly, I think at this point, you\u2019re only solution would be to just say never mind we\u2019ve talked it over you\u2019re right sister and we don\u2019t want him to ever think anything negatively of you so and we can\u2019t afford to take all of you because really none of her business whether you can\u2019t afford to take them all or not. and because we can\u2019t afford to take all of you and can only afford to take the Nephew then we should withdraw our invitation because you\u2019re right we don\u2019t want him to ever think anything negatively of his mother and father because that was absolutely not our intention so I\u2019m so sorry about that. I didn\u2019t think about that being an issue we were just trying to do something nice I\u2019m really sorry so we withdraw our invitation. At the end of the day it doesn\u2019t really matter if the Nephew goes or not he\u2019s not going to remember much of it. Your girls will have just as much fun without him there. It was a nice thought, but the parents are not OK with it so withdraw the offer.", "NTA. Why should you \"stretch things\" to pay for some entitled asshat who is too lazy too work? Offering to pay for your nephew was a nice thing. There is absolutely no reason for you to pay for his parents too.", "NTA. You\u2019ve made the offer. The answer is up to your sister. I\u2019m taken aback at her audacity to be mad about this. Do not back down to keep the peace. That\u2019s how spoiled people get their way when it\u2019s unreasonable.", "NTA They have to take the bad with the good of their lifestyle choices -- they don't get to have their cake and eat it by keeping their own slice and getting someone else to pay for another slice they can eat.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, doing something just to \"keep the peace\" is almost always the wrong choice and the person suggesting it is thinking only of the short-term. A better saying is to \"start as you mean to go on\" -- if you give in to gain short-term peace you just let the thin end of the wedge get inserted and only more of the same will be expected in the future. The precedent will have been set.", "So, we did a WDW family reunion about 17 or 18 years ago. Here's how it went.\n\nI owned a timeshare at the time (I know, I know...) and WDW used to have this great program called Disney YES where you could buy under-cost tickets for your entire party (it has since changed because it was likely costing the company waaaay too much money). It was aimed at homeschoolers but would open up to the general public every now and again. I wanted to take our blended family to WDW and on a whim, we decided to invite the rest of my husband's family along.\n\nThe trip was mostly on our dime. We used my timeshare for free accommodations for our nuclear family, and cheap accommodations for his family. We got seriously low-cost WDW tickets - a couple of hundred bucks each for 5-day park hoppers plus water parks - and found budget airfare for his family. Hell, we even treated the entire family, all 12 of us, to a spendy character breakfast with Lilo and Stitch. We bought parking every day since we were staying off-site, we bought food to cook at the timeshare, we shouldered 90% of expenses for his family.\n\nI didn't regret it (much) because my husband's mom and her husband, and his brother and his son were all extremely grateful that I, as the primary breadwinner, could help them have the family reunion of a lifetime. My now-former SIL however...she complained extensively. She expected that we would tailor all of our activities around her desires. She wanted to direct which parks we'd go to and on what day. She wanted to dictate what we ate, when we ate, where we ate...you get the idea. She bitched that they had a typical hotel room while my family had a suite. And when called out on her entitled behavior, her response was, \"Well, this is OUR vacation!\", conveniently ignoring that I paid for almost all of it.\n\nAt one point, I snapped at her and told her that we were doing things as I had scheduled them (well, Disney had scheduled them because of the YES program) and if she didn't like it, she was welcome to sit her happy ass in the timeshare and wait for us to come back from our daily adventures. She didn't take me up on it but did proceed to be passive aggressively miserable the entire time. We were successful in ignoring her Eeyore behavior, mostly.\n\nI'm sharing this story as a cautionary tale. People are going to be choosing beggars and they will look a gift horse in the mouth. You are NTA if you stand your ground, but be aware of what might happen if you give in and pay for your sister to go with you on your WDW trip.", "NTA but if I read correctly, Aiden will be 18 months old when you go? He won't remember it anyway. And to be completely honest: Disney is overrated.", "Nta. Aiden\u2019s parents are being selfish. I offered to take my niece (17) to California for the first time, since I had lived there. My sister in law refused unless I also took her. She said the same shit. \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss out on all the things she\u2019ll see for the first time\u201d. I called bullshit, she had never been to California, and she wanted to go to.\n\nFine. I\u2019ll wait until she\u2019s 18. Your sister is making this choice for Aiden from a selfish place.", "NTAH. It is very kind to offer to pay for your nephew. If the parents want to come they should pay their own way. It\u2019s completely fair.", "NTA Laura chose to marry a bum for some reason. It\u2019s not your job to subsidize them having memories with their son in Disney World. It\u2019s pretty ballsy for them to even expect someone to pay for a vacation for them, especially when one of them is purposefully unemployed.", "NTA. Like you said, they're choosing to have less income. Your nephew is old enough (I'm guessing) to be in school, so the dad could work a few hours here and there if he chose. \n\n\nIf the gender roles were reversed I would say the same thing. Once your kids are in school there's no need for a full time stay at home parent. If there's no kid to parent then you're simply a Stay at Home Adult. If they want extra disposable income someone elsw needs to work.", "NTA. They already expect a trip from you cuz you can afford it. But do you really know how much this trip will cost you if you take them? As entitled as they sound they seem like the type to run up every bill they can while at disney while making you foot the bill at the same time. This is something that you need to talk to your wife and be transparent about it. Do you really want to have to stretch your budget for someone who will take advantage of you and will not appreciate it anyway because you can afford it and they can't. Please stay on this hill.", "NTA. Taking the kid is generous enough. I had plenty trips with my more wealthy relatives and noone batted an eye", "Don't look gift horses in mouths.", "NTA for offering to take their son but not the parents. However, your brother-in-law being a stay-at-home dad is not something to be mocked, if that is a decision they came to as a family.", "You might be the asshole for judging their family life situation. Is the husband a stay at home dad? Or is he actually not contributing?\n\nOffering to take their child was a nice gesture. It was not lording it over them.", "NTA. I have a very close very large family, and these things ALWAYS get over-involved. Laura may not be just greedy, she's probably realizing her and Ken's choices put them in this spot and it's making her sad and defensive, and she's now in a time-bind to get Ken to do some work outside the house, or let her kid have an awesome experience without them. And if Ken's attitude about making some extra money is not good, he could get some work, make a little money, they could make it to vacation and *still* have a sucky time because their marriage dynamic is changing. Laura may not be evil and money-grubbing, just locked in a lifestyle with no bumper knocking them out of their rut -- until now. OP is still totally NTA.\n\nHowever, unless OP knows the whole story behind Ken's SAH-dad status, perhaps we shouldn't be throwing direct shade at him -- though you can still absolutely say, \"hey, I know you haven't planned for it, but WE didn't plan for 3 extra either. We have enough for 1.\" And just leave it at that. Laura will definitely be TA if she doesn't make financial changes at home, and also doesn't let her son go.", "NTA it was nice of you to offer to take your nephew. Your sister reacted badly and I\u2019m guessing your sibling dynamic is not positive.", "NTA.  The sheer audacity of her argument is disgusting.", "I think you\u2019re NTA over all. I do understand though why your sister is upset. Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot and someone was doing something super extravagant and milestone worthy for your children that you couldn\u2019t ever make happen for them and you had to miss it. You\u2019d be disappointed too. Disney is one of those super big things that parents dream about doing for their kids. For many it\u2019s a once in a lifetime thing. For many more it\u2019s a never in their dreams thing. \n\nI don\u2019t think her arguing with you about it was appropriate and you are under no obligation to pay for more than you are willing to offer. I would follow up and tell your sister what you and your wife are willing to do and if it\u2019s not comfortable for her there are no hard feelings if she declines. Her disappointment and her finances are hers to handle. There\u2019s some time. Maybe she can talk to her husband about getting a part time job to help them all go? \n\nBut on a different mommy note- I would have trouble sending my 6year old so far away from me (idk where you are but we live far enough from Disney that it\u2019s a plane ride) and to such a large and crowded place without me. 6 year olds are still quite small and dependent on their familiar care givers for comfort and stability. That kind of trip would be a lot for a little human. And honestly, I think he\u2019s too young for Disney. My brother went when he was 6 and I was 11. I remember the trip but he doesn\u2019t at all. But that\u2019s just my personal opinion.", "FWIW I would still buy Aiden the vacation and give it to him as a birthday gift. Let his selfish parents tell him that he can\u2019t go because you don\u2019t want to fund his deadbeat parents.", "ESH especially the people commenting that they agree with your viewpoints of Ken.\n\nIf Laura was a stay at home mom full time, everyone would be coming for you saying that being a stay at home parent IS a full time job.\n\nLaura shouldn't have gotten angry like that in an entitled fashion. \n\nBut you also say you could take them but just don't feel like it, and its because you don't agree with a man being a stay-at-home parent. Be honest. \n\nDude you're a mega A-hole, especially knowing they might not be able to ever take him themselves and it doesnt make an impact on your lifestyle. Every parent wants to have memories with their kid at a magical park like Disney. It could have been a great bonding experience for you and your sister as well, but you've ruined it.", "NTA. They made their bed, and now they have to lay in it. For whatever reason her husband doesn\u2019t want to work, as you said, it is their business, however, they cannot expect you, or anybody else for that matter to fund their way on trips. It was incredibly generous of you to offer to take their son. They should be happy that he could have that experience.", "NTA. It is absolutly insane of them to think that you would invite them too. And Laura is more than selfish to think she should hold Aiden's change back because she wants to go too but couldn't avoid it. You ask way beforehand. So they could still try to save the money till the trip so they can pay for themself and come with you. \n\nDon't feel sorry. You did a nice gesture. Just wait, if they come around. When you are about to book anything for the trip, you could ask them again, if Aiden will come. But elsewhen don't mention it again.", "NTA Laura is acting entitled to expect you to pay for her and her husband. She's being selfish if she denies her kid the chance to go just because she won't go as well.", "NTA - You did a nice gesture for your nephew and it was completely ruined by his mother.  Withdraw the offer, now there is too much drama all caused by Aiden's parents.  If Aiden finds out and blames his parents for not being able to go, that would a them problem, not yours.", "Nta. \n\nYou know what - at the end of the day- you are creating memories for all and what a gift.\n\nJust take the whole family if you can afford it.\n\nAll the kids will have a good time- memories will be made how Uncle took everyone to Disneyworld!\n\nHow can you beat that? Smiling kids.. lifelong memories and just keep it light.  \n\n\nGo for it and make the difference!!   Take lots of photos for later years!  \n\nAnd thank yourself.  Who cares what they think k. Do it for your sister and nephew and your family!", "NTA - any time parents get pissy about something that would be good for the child but not for them it shows what they're like as people.  I would absolutely not be paying for the parents to go, you made a nice gesture but her jealousy ruined it for her own child, that is low.", "NTA.\n\nBut I am having one of those \u201cWere we normal?\u201d moments, in which I am questioning my family\u2019s actions. When I was a kid, there were times in which my brother and I did go on vacations without our parents. I still think it was okay.", "Stand firm! NTA", "NTA - your money your choice but you probably won\u2019t be taking your nephew.", "NTA-ken chose to be a SAHD. That\u2019s not a bad thing. Offering to take your nephew is a good thing. My only issue is that you seem a bit condescending towards Ken for choosing to stay home with his son. Had Laura chosen to be a SAHM, would you still be condescending towards them? You don\u2019t have to take Aiden, and you are being very generous to take him. I think your sister should let him go.", "Nta\n\nYour sister is being selfish here. She wants to enjoy her son's experiences at Disney, but can't do it herself, so she's saying she'll deny him the chance.", "Holy entitlement Batman! Your sister and her husband are both a-h\u2019s of the first degree! You made a generous offer to take your nephew. You don\u2019t need to also take his parents. Yechhh, what a pair of mooches! Ken can get a fucking job if they want to go. \n\nNTA", "NTA - they really thought they were getting a free trip? Personally I wouldn\u2019t bother bringing the nephew, it\u2019ll cause too much drama and ruin your daughter\u2019s celebration.", "NTA.\n\nIt is very kind of you to offer to take your nephew along.  This can still be a 'vacation' of sorts for his parents, as they can have a private staycation, or whatever.\n\nThese sort of things set a precedent- if you cave and take them all this time, your sis may expect to have her family included in future vacations of yours.  Because the situation probably won't be different- they won't want to let the nephew go without them because they'll want to experience it too, and you'll want to take the nephew because he may not get a chance to go that place otherwise.  \n\nKeep your offer as it stands.", "NTA. I've been here and done that with my niece. Hold firm to your boundaries. If he can come, that's great, if not that's ok. My family is the type where you have to include everyone in everything and it usually ends up with me and my s/o footing bills for someone in my family. If you set up the precedent that they have to be included in every trip, you will have 0 peaceful vacations without them nagging. It's not the end of the world to only invite the child, especially to a place as expensive as Disney!", "What kind of parent would allow their pride or ego to prevent their kid from a great trip/experience?

Where's *theirs*? \n\nNope. Nope. Nope.", "NTA. Don\u2019t cave on this. I don\u2019t think your wife understand it will become the funding and \u201cLaura and family show\u201d.

And frankly I also don\u2019t blame you for your views on Ken\u2019s working situation.

Names changed to protect the (not-so-) innocent.  I'm 39M, my wife is Anna (39f) my kids are Amy (9f) and Connie (7f).  My sister is Laura (37f), her husband is Ken (36m), and their son is Aiden (6m).\n\nI'm planning to take my kids to Disney world next year for Amy's 10th birthday.  While discussing plans for the trip, Anna and I thought we might offer to take Aiden with us.  Amy and Connie get along well with Aiden, and he's never been.  I'm not sure if Aiden will get the chance to go otherwise.  Laura and Ken don't have a ton of money.  They don't lack for necessities, but they don't have much disposable income beyond that.\n\nWhen I brought this up with Laura she was super excited at first.  She told me they'd love to go with us.  I told her that I'd be happy to have the whole family along but I was only offering to pay Aiden's way.  She got pissed at that.  She said it was unfair for me to take him without them because they'd miss out on getting to enjoy those special moments with their son.  She said I was was lording my money over them and trying to buy their son's love.  \n\nWhere I might be a bit of an asshole here is that I view Laura and Ken's financial situation as voluntary.  Laura makes pretty decent money as an engineer, but Ken has never worked.  Not before Aiden was born, not after Aiden started school.  He has a college degree, he has no disabilities, he just chooses not to work.  I don't understand it, but at the end of the day it works for them and it's really none of my business, so I've never said anything to them about it.  But I do see their money problems as self-inflicted and because of that I choose not to help them out financially a lot of the time even if I could afford to.  \n\nAnyway, I got kind of mad at Laura saying I'm lording my money over them and trying to buy their son's love.  I told her it's not my fault that they can't afford to go to Disney world and that I \\*thought\\* I was doing something nice by taking Aiden with me.  If I thought she was going to get mad at me for offering to do something nice I would never have offered in the first place.  Laura said I'm putting her in an impossible situation since if Aiden ever found out he could have gone to Disney World and she didn't let him he'd never forgive her.  I said that was her problem and the offer to take Aiden (and only Aiden) still stood.\n\nAnna doesn't thing I'm wrong, but she thinks to keep the peace we should just take the whole family.  We could afford to if we stretched things a little bit.  I see it as I'm already offering to do something extremely generous and that Laura and Ken are just trying to take advantage of me.  Will I be the asshole if I stand firm and only pay Aiden's way?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Amusement parks and other age appropriate activities are not cheap.", "NTA - You're being generous by bringing your nephew when he didn't have to.
