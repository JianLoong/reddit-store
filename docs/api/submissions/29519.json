We have our issues, but then again, which couple doesn't, right? However, lately, he has been ridiculing my studies and the degree I'm getting. I'm studying in the Netherlands and he lives in Denmark, so we will close the distance next year after the wedding. I'm currently in my last year of the bachelor's degree in biomedical sciences. I would argue (but of course I'm biased) that this is a very intensive study and requires a lot of time and effort.\n\nSometimes when I complain about this, he says that my degree doesn't matter and that I would be better off quitting anyway. The reason why he says this is because we would like to have a marriage with more traditional gender roles once we are married. So he will earn the money and I will become a SAHM. I don't have a problem with this, but I would like to have a degree to fall back on during tough times. Whenever I try to make this argument, he shuts it down immediately and claims that I would be better off just quitting my studies and becoming a housewife already, since once we are married I will never use my degree anyway. I would not mind working e.g. two times a week, but he is strongly opposed to this as he claims that it would interfere with my tasks and chores in our marriage. \n\nHe is currently still in carpentry school, which consists of him having several months of work followed by weeks of school, both of which he gets paid for. Not only does he dismiss the difficulty of my degree, but he also claims that the work he is doing is much harder. I can't disagree with him, because physically speaking it is definitely much more intensive, but I would like for him to acknowledge that my degree is also time-consuming and difficult. \n\nRecently he made a joke about what a waste of time it was, me getting my degree when I should be in DK and making him dinner instead, since that would be more fulfilling for both him and me. I know I should not let these harmless jokes get under my skin, but I lashed out at him and told him he needed to stop ridiculing my academic achievements and dismissing all of it so easily, since it might come in handy at some point in the future. He then quite seriously told me (again) that I shouldn't take everything so personally and that he was speaking the truth, since I will not use my degree once we are married so it is a waste of time and money. Then somehow he spun it around and told me that I was not appreciative enough of him wanting to provide for me and our future family and that if I wanted to be a 'girlboss' I would be free to do so on my own. \n\nSo now I'm wondering if I did make a mistake by telling him to stop ridiculing my degree and if I somehow hurt him by appearing ungrateful. So, AITA?", "created_utc": 1698083399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eqgie/aita_for_telling_my_20f_fianc\u00e9_24m_that_he_needs/", "score": 2387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Happened to an older relative of mine - her husband unfortunately died of colon cancer while they still had 5 kids in the house to raise and support with few options. If this guy loves you, he won't want you and any children you have to be in that situation if the worst happens. So why is he trying to force you into something that would put you into that position?\n\nThere's a touch of contempt in what you report him saying. Frankly, Bio-medical science is a degree that almost anyone who isn't biased for personal reasons would admit is one of the more difficult ones. Similar to law or engineering degrees, most people would acknowledge it takes a lot of study and inherent intelligence. I think your fiance is saying that he doesn't respect it because he thinks that as a woman you are inherently not capable of intelligence and doing well academically, so he assumes that if you are able to get that degree then it must not require much intelligence after all. It's not the degree itself he's holding in contempt, it's your native talents and intelligence as a woman. \n\nThere's also a parade of red flags going on that, taken together, are very concerning. At the absolute least you need to wait to get married until you've been in the same place for several months. \n\nRed flags being: He doesn't want you to be able to support yourself if you need to. Since you're moving to another country for him you will also be isolated and away from any support network that might normally help you if things go sour with him. You're also long distance, so it's easier for him to put on a role for you and not show if he's abusive, and it sounds like he wants to keep it long distance until you are locked into marriage rather than taking time dating once you both are together so you're sure you are compatibility day to day in proximity. \n\nYou two are at ages where your maturity gap is huge, and often in these cases the older partner dates someone younger because he's counting on your naivety to miss his red flags until he's able to lock you in somehow - like taking away your livelihood or marrying and having children so that you'll be \"stuck\" by the time you realize how bad things are. Often more mature partners will also seek out a younger one so they have a power dynamic in your favor, and he's already being controlling. \n\nHe doesn't seem to value what you want in life or make an effort to support you simply because it's important to you and his love for you makes what's important to you also important to him. Also, he shouldn't be threatening to leave you if he really wants to marry you. That's not something you do when you're all-in, and he seems to be threatening leaving in an attempt to manipulate you which is incredibly unhealthy behavior. \n\nI do have some relatives that are religious with traditional role marriages, but neither partner ever puts down the other or treats them with contempt like your fiance is doing. He's not treating you with love and respect, and that points much more toward severe misogyny than traditional values. Also, you say you have problems already like \"most couples do\". But in a relationship that's heading toward marriage, there shouldn't be serious issues cropping up. You should be able to hear each other, respect each other, support each other, and value your partner's wants and needs. It should be you two against difficult times instead of you two against each other, and if you do have disagreements they should be respectful and focus on how you two can compromise rather than one of you \"winning\", and reading between the lines it doesn't sound like you have that.", "Please don\u2019t marry that guy.

Children also needed constant available care, because without it they would frequently die (they died frequently anyways, but it would have been worse).\n\nBecause of this huge adversity, many norms developed where men would work long hours, frequently in dangerous jobs, and women would work long hours at home. This does not mean that they didn't love and respect and cherish each other, and it especially does not mean they'd throw away hard won talents just because it didn't fit their pre-arranged life narrative.

And of course laws protecting male violence and assault against them, laws that prevented women securing property, and bank accounts, and laws that made divorce harder (ie before no-fault divorce). For most of history, women were effectively controlled not only (as we might picture) simply by violence or the threat of violence, but by a set of patterns than remove all their options from them.
