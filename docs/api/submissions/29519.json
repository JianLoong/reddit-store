We have our issues, but then again, which couple doesn't, right? However, lately, he has been ridiculing my studies and the degree I'm getting. I'm studying in the Netherlands and he lives in Denmark, so we will close the distance next year after the wedding. I'm currently in my last year of the bachelor's degree in biomedical sciences. I would argue (but of course I'm biased) that this is a very intensive study and requires a lot of time and effort.\n\nSometimes when I complain about this, he says that my degree doesn't matter and that I would be better off quitting anyway. The reason why he says this is because we would like to have a marriage with more traditional gender roles once we are married. So he will earn the money and I will become a SAHM. I don't have a problem with this, but I would like to have a degree to fall back on during tough times. Whenever I try to make this argument, he shuts it down immediately and claims that I would be better off just quitting my studies and becoming a housewife already, since once we are married I will never use my degree anyway. I would not mind working e.g. two times a week, but he is strongly opposed to this as he claims that it would interfere with my tasks and chores in our marriage. \n\nHe is currently still in carpentry school, which consists of him having several months of work followed by weeks of school, both of which he gets paid for. Not only does he dismiss the difficulty of my degree, but he also claims that the work he is doing is much harder. I can't disagree with him, because physically speaking it is definitely much more intensive, but I would like for him to acknowledge that my degree is also time-consuming and difficult. \n\nRecently he made a joke about what a waste of time it was, me getting my degree when I should be in DK and making him dinner instead, since that would be more fulfilling for both him and me. I know I should not let these harmless jokes get under my skin, but I lashed out at him and told him he needed to stop ridiculing my academic achievements and dismissing all of it so easily, since it might come in handy at some point in the future. He then quite seriously told me (again) that I shouldn't take everything so personally and that he was speaking the truth, since I will not use my degree once we are married so it is a waste of time and money. Then somehow he spun it around and told me that I was not appreciative enough of him wanting to provide for me and our future family and that if I wanted to be a 'girlboss' I would be free to do so on my own. \n\nSo now I'm wondering if I did make a mistake by telling him to stop ridiculing my degree and if I somehow hurt him by appearing ungrateful. So, AITA?", "created_utc": 1698083399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eqgie/aita_for_telling_my_20f_fianc\u00e9_24m_that_he_needs/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not give everything up for this idiot.", "NTA. Honestly reconsider the choices you are making though. The only justification for why he would want you to quit now is so that he can control your future prospects.\n\nIs this really the guy you want to basically control your life from here on?  Who puts down your effort and time?", "NTA. He doesn't respect you or the decisions you make. If anything, it sounds like he's threatened by your choice of degrees. You are only TA if you continue this relationship. Nothing is going to change his mind, he's hide bound to gender roles and he's inflexible about entertaining anything else.", "NTA but can't you see that he's trying to hobble you by having you quit your education? That just gives him more power and control over your future.", "Exactly. I'd tell her to run, but it seems she doesn't see an obvious trap that lies right before her.\nI only hope it's fake.", "Heya (((: yes, I'm pretty sure I was born and raised in NL and he in DK haha. I understand what you mean, we definitely have good support systems. I would like to add, however, that the flexibility of course is highly dependent on where and in which branch you work. It is still, in NL at least and how I experience it, expected that you work near to full-time. I would love to be a SAHM! And we are both religious and feel like we are a good match on all other aspects in life, which is the reason why we are getting married relatively young (: hope that answers your questions", "I completely agree with you. He has told me the same time several times too, about caring about a degree and what not. He definitely does respect me, I would say. Whenever I make a home cooked meal or tidy up around the house for example he is super appreciative and grateful and always mentions it and thanks me, so that is not the problem", "Being religious does not mean that you should be treated with this sort of contempt. Marriages based on religious beliefs also can fail therefore it is  wise to have a back up plan.", "Honey, this man does not respect you as a person, or your skills and time. He is not a good match.  Wanting to be a SAHM and housewife, being in traditional gender roles, being religious,  that's all fine and good in a marriage where the parties respect each other. He doesn't. You may be just as fulfilled making dinner as you are working. But that doesn't give him the right to say your education is wasteful, or to demean your efforts. He is not looking for a partnership of equals based on his comments. He's looking at you as a brood mare and bang maid.", "No, he's not a good match.  Stop trying to convince yourself of that.", "If you are a 'good match' now, you will be a good match 5 years from now. Please do not rush into a marriage now because you 'match'. At your young ages, you still have a lot of growing to do.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being a SAHM if that is what you really want. I'm getting vibes from your husband to be that you will be one doing everything for the child and house while he expects a clean house and hot meal on the table when he gets home.\n\nHe's already belittling you, saying that you should quit your worthless degree since you won't need to use it after you get married. Instead of encouraging you to be the best person you can be so that you can be the best mom you can be, he is making you feel inferior. After you marry, you will be dependent on him for everything. What if the marriage goes south- how will you be able to escape with the kids? You need to think long and hard about the sacrifice that you will be making.", "Well I doubt you will have your own business as a biomedical scientist and branches are a lot. From biomedical rappresentative to lab. Those are indeed quite flexible. Then I don\u2019t know what will be your branch. I dunno religion cause Denmark is heavily Lutheran (like almost all)  and Netherland is more Catholic  with some Protestant. So how it is between you two?\nThat said if you want to be a SHAM, which is great valid choice, good for you. And yes there are still some field you can still land into the future.", "Thanking you for making dinner or cleaning up messes isn\u2019t respect", "Patting your head and telling you that you're a good dog isn't respect.", "We are both Catholic (: I think so too. SAHM is what I want to be, but of course money and income is another matter", "Can I ask what in your opinion does constitute to respect? I appreciate what he does for me and he appreciates what I do for him (:", "I feel like this is maybe a bit harsh. I enjoy cooking and cleaning, not because I\u2019m told or supposed to enjoy it, but because it brings me calm and peace. I do it out of my free will and enjoy it, that isn\u2019t me being the equivalent of a dog right ((:", "Well you are not getting pregnant out of the batt. Try work and see, consider most of bioscience filed do require consistent training to keep up with new technology. But not all! And yes SHAM you do it until kids start school, preschool, daycare (whatever grade you choose) so it\u2019s not forever. You are absolutely right to think about a future where you will be working and providing (cause then the cost will not be childcare but a YTA curricular activities, their future education and so on). You go girl! Sounds you have very clear ideas what you want.", "Lol just saw your other post in relationship advice - at least a dog is allowed to have friends.\n\nSo sad to watch teenage girls ruin their life like this", "I may add I have a medical degree and when my third kid arrived i m currently on indef. maternal leave. I felt I missed a lot when my other kids were born. So take your time enjoy n then go back work."]}
