She cooks, does dishes, cleans the kitchen, and does laundry. You want her to scrub floors and bathrooms and dust. I'm not sure what terms you laid out for expected tasks. Maybe it just wasn't clear to her that there are things you want her to complete versus what you typically manage. If you did her usual tasks maybe she washed the balcony thinking she needed to find something to keep busy. Maybe she doesn't dust your office be a use you're working from home whilr shr cleans and she doesnt want to disturb you. Also she's at least late sixties or older based on your description, so maybe it's hard for her to scrub floors and toilets. Maybe she's doing what she can. It's fine to let her go, but I also think it's important for you to be very clear in your expectations and reasonable in what you expect from the housekeeper you hire.", "NTA sounds like you need a new housekeeper.", "NTA, you may not want to fire her, but you hired her to do a job that she isn't doing, so unless you are handing out charity, you gotta fire her", "It\u2019s possible that now should be the time to retire but cannot afford to.

It had been a while so I asked for it all. The lady came late and she cleaned my bathroom but not well. She told me was in the kitchen cleaning the over. She never touched the oven.

Why can't you just fire her and hire someone else?", "NTA\nIf you don\u2019t want to fire her change her duties to cook and laundress and reduce the pay, then hire a significantly younger housekeeper. If you\u2019re in the country I suspect you would have to fight workers off for the wages you\u2019re offering.", "I'll set aside my personal feelings for a second and look at this from a business perspective. You paid her to do a job, she, for whatever reason, is not doing what she's being paid to do. Last I checked, housekeeping isn't just washing the balcony and playing in the water. So either she can do the job or she can take her services elsewhere. Paying someone to do a job and them not doing it is a waste of money, and even more wasteful if you keep them around because you feel bad for removing someone's income. That's not how business works, and despite popular opinion, nobody has a right to someone else's money without an effort to earn it. NTA.\n\nETA: \"forcing\" someone to work is not ok, you can't \"force\" someone to do something they want to do. In this sense, it's a simple matter of \"do what I'm paying you to do or you're no longer welcome here and will not be paid by me moving forward.\" Sorry....I get hung up on the word \"force\" being that it's a concept I deal with extensively as a professional.", "She is not doing her job, and she is ignoring you when you tell her to, she needs to go.", "NTA, but what is needed is good communication.  I can sense a strong desire to avoid confrontation here, which has likely led to differing expectations.  You need to have a list of expected tasks in order of priority and sit down with her and have a discussion about your expectations.  \n\nand see if she commits to that or says \"hey, I'm not the person for this job; I don't do floors\"", "YTA.  She's been working for over 50 years and you expect her to scrub floors?  Hiring someone 60+ to scrub floors and bathrooms seems pretty unrealistic.", "ESH, she\u2019s not doing her job but I don\u2019t understand why you have to ask anyone else what you should do about it.  If you don\u2019t know how to manage people or how to hire someone to do a job correctly, you shouldn\u2019t have people working for you.", "YTA you want a 50 year old woman to scrub your floors and clean your house, cook, do laundry, etc for just 50$ a day?\n\nI don't care if that's a good wage where you live, since you can clearly afford to pay more this is exploitation of an elderly poor woman and you are a bad person for doing it.", "NTA but you might be better off if you come up with a list if daily, weekly, and monthly tasks you expect from her so she has a more structured idea of how to prioritize her time.", "She is a very christian lady, very involved with her faith. At hernage, she should be retired, with time tondo what she likes. She has worked hard since her teens..", "Yes! Thank you!", "Actually, you got it. I was just checking with a cleaning service. You know the type: they clean behind furniture, over, under and inside everything.", "This is the difficult part... thank you!", "Thank you.

I am trying to make her do the job she was hired to do. I wrote force bc she was just finding any excuse to not do it.", "Thank you! Will do!", "Work isn't a charity. You pay people to do a job not laze around. If she's incapable of doing the job she doesn't have to do it.", "When you say scrub floors, I think of 1800's maids on her 4 with a big brush. I have all equipment so she can clean my bathroom in a very comfortable way. I am not checking anything with a magnifying glass and white gloves. Just a mop with good products will do.", "?\n\nSo op should fire her because people over 60 shouldn't be doing this job?", "I have a lot of people working for me. I have no problem giving orders to the other people. \nI cannot give orders to her. Probably bc of my origin and where I am right now.\nIf you think I should not ask it, you should not read it...", "None of the duties OP lists are out of line for a housekeeper. She's not exploiting an elderly woman. This woman agreed to become their housekeeper, she wasn't forced into slavery.

My 60 yo housekeeper is building right now her beach house. She is making double the minimum salary working only 2 days a week. This is a very good pay.", "This is a good idea. I told her just generally what I wanted and had only one golden rule: no metal on my nonstick pans. I just bought new pans because she destroyed the nonstick.", "Gotcha. I can show her some sympathy.", "I truly hope it works out for you.  You sound like a lovely spirit, but please don't let anyone take you kindness for granted.  May your today be better than your yesterday, and may your tomorrow be better than your today.", "You're good, I understood what you meant. I'm just used to lawyerisms that might save someone's ass in court. There's no excuse for not doing what you're paid to do. If you didn't communicate your expectations clearly, certainly that's on your end to correct, but if you've done that and they aren't doing it, there's no logical reason to tolerate it.", "YTA for hiring someone 60+ for heavy duty cleaning and paying them shit wages.  If she's not performing up to your standards, then let her go and hire someone else.  Try to find someone young and strong to exploit for cheap labor, since that's what it seems you're after.", "Yeah like girl wanted the job? So we collectively just refuse to hire people over 60 for the jobs they want/have occupied (ya know\u2026like age discrimination)", "If there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, I don\u2019t understand what your question is.  You say you can fire her.  But not manage her?  People should do the job they are paid to do. Clearly.   If you can\u2019t do anything about her work, hire someone new to come in on a different day.", "No, 50$/hr for 7 hours a day is not good pay. I don't care if it can buy a house in your home country, you're trying to pay her below the US minimum wage to scrub on her hands and knees. That makes you a bad person.

I will give her a chance.", "Yeah, lost in translation, sorry. I learned a lot here and have a plan now.", "Where did you read I expect her to perform heavy duty cleaning.
