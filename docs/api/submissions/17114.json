Obviously, she was excited about the house, and would video call other relatives to show the house.

He told her off and she apologized. But later she came to me and said that I shouldn\u2019t have overreacted because she was just showing her grandson the house. Her grandson is 11 years old and according to her it was \u2018 not such a big deal\u2019. \nI can\u2019t get over \u2018not such a big deal\u2019 comment. I am unable to forget the incident and my already troubled relationship with my husband is actually coming to an end because of this incidence. He continuously tells me that since she apologized, I should move on and that I am \u2018obsessed\u2019 with hatred towards his mother.\nI didn\u2019t hate his mother before this incident, but her nonchalance towards the whole event and my husband gaslighting me over it is making it impossible for me even though it\u2019s almost been a year that this happened. \nIt doesn\u2019t help that I am eight months pregnant and she has not called me even once to find out how I am. She talks to my husband, almost daily and inquires about me.\nAITA for not moving on after she live streamed me sleeping half naked me in my bedroom?\n\nEditing to add that she was not live-streaming because I didn\u2019t have any clothes on (she genuinely didn\u2019t know that when she opened the door or until I jumped up in surprise when I saw her hand). She was live-streaming the house as a whole and not me in particular. But she was aware that I was sleeping in my room. I am not making excuses but I don\u2019t want to give an impression that my mother in law was trying to do something illegal. Violation of privacy perhaps.

Unfortunately your husband puts his mummy first.", "Blaming you for \u201coverreacting\u201c negates any apology she had previously made.
