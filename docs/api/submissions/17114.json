Obviously, she was excited about the house, and would video call other relatives to show the house. One day I was sleeping in my bedroom when I suddenly noticed the door open, and a hand with the phone inside the room. Turns out she herself was standing outside the room, but was live streaming the bedroom with me asleep in it to some relative. \nI woke up quickly, covered myself  (it was the middle of summer and I was wearing my skimpy summer pyjamas) and called my husband to handle the situation. He told her off and she apologized. But later she came to me and said that I shouldn\u2019t have overreacted because she was just showing her grandson the house. Her grandson is 11 years old and according to her it was \u2018 not such a big deal\u2019. \nI can\u2019t get over \u2018not such a big deal\u2019 comment. I am unable to forget the incident and my already troubled relationship with my husband is actually coming to an end because of this incidence. He continuously tells me that since she apologized, I should move on and that I am \u2018obsessed\u2019 with hatred towards his mother.\nI didn\u2019t hate his mother before this incident, but her nonchalance towards the whole event and my husband gaslighting me over it is making it impossible for me even though it\u2019s almost been a year that this happened. \nIt doesn\u2019t help that I am eight months pregnant and she has not called me even once to find out how I am. She talks to my husband, almost daily and inquires about me.\nAITA for not moving on after she live streamed me sleeping half naked me in my bedroom?\n\nEditing to add that she was not live-streaming because I didn\u2019t have any clothes on (she genuinely didn\u2019t know that when she opened the door or until I jumped up in surprise when I saw her hand). She was live-streaming the house as a whole and not me in particular. But she was aware that I was sleeping in my room. I am not making excuses but I don\u2019t want to give an impression that my mother in law was trying to do something illegal. Violation of privacy perhaps.

I\u2019ve heard a similar story but the MIL kept trying to justify it by saying it\u2019s normal in her culture. \n\nNTA. She invaded your privacy and exposed you while you were sleeping. You have every right to be angry with her. Also, you shouldn\u2019t expect any phone calls from her b/c she\u2019s victimizing herself.", "NTA\n\nWtf, that is an insane privacy violation. And punishable by law if i\u2018m not mistaken. Doing that is insane!", "NTA - and tell MIL that you are getting the house, to yourself. Bring this up to a lawyer", "NTA what else is your MIL going to think is ok that (almost) everyone else finds appalling and intrusive? \nYou are going to need very strict rules about what access she is allowed to your children. \nAnd I would not allow her to ever stay in your house after such a creepy violation.\nWhy would your husband's 11 year old nephew need (or want) to know what your bedroom looked like anyway?", "NTA. There's no good reason to be showing you in bed at night to a child. It's not even her home. Unfortunately your husband puts his mummy first.", "Blaming you for \u201coverreacting\u201c negates any apology she had previously made. Combined with your husband thinking that an apology sweeps everything away, and you are better off without this toxic duo in your life. NTA", "NTA on principle , she had no right live streaming anything in the first place without checking with both of you (not just her son), and DEFINITELY not opening your bedroom and live-streaming when she knew you were in (has she ever heard of privacy or knocking even)?\nThe act itself might have been a sod mistake but her attitude of downplaying it is terrible. \nIf your husband thinks it\u2019s normal tell him you it can be done to his mother next time randomly while she\u2019s asleep or in her nighty in the kitchen and see how useful is your \u201cI\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s not a big deal\u201d", "NTA.\n\nYou sleeping half naked, and she comes in to live stream it?", "Next time you\u2019re over at her house walk in on her in the bathroom with your FaceTime on. tell her the same thing", "NTA\n\nClassic example of how with a sincere apology and owning the wrong this would have been long in the past. But an apology followed by \u201cwhy are you so upset, it wasn\u2019t a big deal anyway\u201d means it\u2019s an unforgettable wedge in the relationship.\n\nPeople who cannot own their wrongs are infuriating. They\u2019re effectively telling you \u201cI\u2019m going to do this again if I want to, because your feelings don\u2019t matter\u201d\n\nWith your mother in law, you can maybe spend less time with her and it will take care of the issue.\n\nWith your husband, if he\u2019s like this, don\u2019t expect him to change. Evaluate your tolerance for this behavior with the understanding that he will always be like this.", "NTA", "NTA, live stream her house to some relative of yours whilst she\u2019s in the shower and we how she likes it", "nta. if it is normal for her culture, then her and your hubby will have no problem when you start videoing them pooping, or changing, or getting in/out of the shower.", "NTA. I'd be demanding her immediate departure. She would not be allowed to return for some time and certainly not until she apologized profusely for invading your privacy. She needs to firmly understand that your home is not hers. She has to bear in mind that she is the invader unless she has asked permission for virtually anything involving your home. If she cannot absorb the concept of home ownership and just normal decency, I'd invite her to not darken my doorstep any more.\n\nAnd your hubby has to get with the the program. Demand marriage counseling where boundaries and expectations are discussed. He should be livid that someone besides himself has seen his spouse half naked, mother be damned. Would he be as nonchalant if one of your friends had done the same thing, broadcasting his naked image God knows where, while he snoozed? How about a semi naked child?", "Boundaries are difficult with two different cultures. I know that when your reaction upsets them, they can shut down and refuse to converse with you because they don't have it in them to apologize. In their eyes you overreacted and should apologize.", "NTA such an invasion of privacy I'd make her get out and wouldn't allow her to come back.", "It was rude of your MIL, but certainly not worth ending your marriage over!
