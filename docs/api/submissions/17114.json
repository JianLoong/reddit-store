He told her off and she apologized. But later she came to me and said that I shouldn\u2019t have overreacted because she was just showing her grandson the house.

She talks to my husband, almost daily and inquires about me.\nAITA for not moving on after she live streamed me sleeping half naked me in my bedroom?\n\nEditing to add that she was not live-streaming because I didn\u2019t have any clothes on (she genuinely didn\u2019t know that when she opened the door or until I jumped up in surprise when I saw her hand). She was live-streaming the house as a whole and not me in particular. But she was aware that I was sleeping in my room.
