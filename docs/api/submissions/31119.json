My fianc\u00e9 was literally the best guy i have ever met my soulmate and best relationship i have ever had and we were perfect for each other.  He was the most care free person I have ever met. We were both Sharing a house with my mom and step Dad as my step dad wasn't working and my mom is recently disabled not working either. My fianc\u00e9 and I both had jobs I am still with my company currently and we were squirreling away money to get a place of our own.  We were also paying all the bills at this home to help them out and we even used our squirrel fund to get my moms car out of repossession after they towed it for non-payment. My mom never told me she was so behind and was getting short term disability at the time so since him and I were covering bills I thought she was paying it.  I came home from work and found him passed away in our bed and this has been the hardest time in my life. I still cry almost everyday and getting out of bed to go to work and be productive at work and home is extremely difficult for me. Since he died I have not been able to part with any of his Belongings from his clothes to his bodywash and shampoo in the bathroom. Everything is were he left it. The only thing that I have cleared out Is his nightstand and dresser drawers because when he moved in I had to shove all my stuff in a few drawers I still have everything it's just in a box in our room. His hats our still on his side of the room on the wall where he left them. After he moved in, I had put command hooks on the wall and made him a little set up of his hats. Because he has so many and he loved it. And they are still there and all of his toiletries are where they were. My stepdad has asked me numerous times to give him or sell him His bathroom stuff such as body wash, shampoos etc and I say no I don't want to move it. Tonight he asked again and it's been really tough with Thanksgiving next week and he's been on my mind every second. So tonight I burst into tears and yelled at him that I can't understand why he can't leave it alone and stormed off. Now stepdad is mad and Is not talking to me. AITIA for not wanting to part with my fianc\u00e9s stuff 7 months after losing him?", "created_utc": 1700185039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x3meu/aita_for_not_wanting_to_sell_my_deas_fianc\u00e9s/", "score": 393, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your step-dad has no place demanding things of you, especially since you seem to be financing the entire household.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "Holy moley, NTA. That is incredibly insensitive, and way over the line. I am so sorry for everything that you\u2019re going through. I imagine I\u2019d cope the same way. \n\nIf your stepdad has money to offer to buy your fianc\u00e9s belongings, he has money to go buy those things. Or order them. Amazon has all that shit.", "NTA. Your step dad sure is though", "NTA. Its ok you snapped at him. He was being an ass and deserved to get bitched out a bit. For what its worth you have my consoleneces.", "NTA  You need to cut off the moochers and get your own place to live alone and grieve!", "NTA move out on your own, pack in a memory box your fianc\u00e9s items. \n\nIt\u2019ll be sensible to create space between where he passed and your family.", "NTA. You're still grieving and your step-dad should be picking up those signs and know to tread carefully, especially heading into a special time of the year. For step-dad to be mad at you now instead of reflecting on whether he is being reasonable is just childish.\n\nAnd body wash? So you can be reminded of your fiance every time you visit your step-dad? I can't even...", "nta, sorry for you loss\n\nyour stepdad sucks.", "I\u2019m so very sorry for your loss.

You need out of that house and away from them as soon as you are able to do so emotionally. Please find a grief counselor to help you through this. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Grieve in whatever way you must.", "NTA - no one gets to decide when it's time for you to move on which is basically what's he's doing.

Nor is there any one way to grieve. \n\nParting with stuff is so hard. I know some people say you just have to get up and do it to help with the grieving process.

I am so sorry for your loss. Your stepdad is being an AH.", "NTA.  You are allowed to grieve as long as you need to, and if keeping his shampoo helps you cope day-to-day, your stepdad can buy his own damn shampoo.

And that\u2019s being generous because body wash stuff isn\u2019t that expensive", "NTA. Grief has its own time line and it is not linear. You will know when it is time to clear anything out. My Father passed away in 2009. His mini bottles of his favorite colognes are still in the little cupboard in the half bathroom. Whenever I am really missing him, I open a bottle and smell them. It makes me feel close to my Dad. Scents have a way of becoming powerful memories. Tell your step-dad he needs to back off and drop the subject period. He will not be getting any of these things from you. If he has money to pay you for them then he can take his behind to the nearest store and purchase his own toiletries. He can do that on the way to look for a job for himself. Make it crystal clear to him right now that those items are not for him and you will not be giving them to him Period. Full stop.\nI am so sorry for your loss OP.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry OP. My heart goes out to you. You have every right to hold on to his things. Your step-dad has no right to any of them, or the profits from them. He\u2019s a grown man and should be providing for himself. If you have any ability to, please speak to a professional about your grief. Finding a loved one like that is a very traumatic experience and it may be helpful to you to speak to someone. You also might look for grief groups in your area. The funeral home that took care of him might have some direction there. My deepest condolences to you OP.", "NTA.  Grief is not a race to be won and you step dad needs to stfu.  Much love to you friend.", "NTA. Absolutely not! First of all, I am so sorry for your loss!\n\nIt is extremely insensitive of your stepfather to keep wanting to buy those things. You may not want to get rid of them for a long, long time, and that is your prerogative. Don't let anyone try and tell you how or how long you can grieve. Grief is different for everybody. 7 months is like yesterday. Virtually no time at all.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. In time you will heal. Take all the time you need. Step dad needs to back the eff off. Wtf is wrong with him??", "I lost my husband 7 months ago. I have rearranged some things but for the most part everything is the same. I use his body wash and body spray, it makes him feel near. I also wear some of his clothes. When you are ready your heart will tell you.  NTA", "NTA, keep his stuff as long as you want.

If they aren\u2019t helping you right now they need to go.", "Wow. Losing a loved one is a terrible thing. Stepdad is AH. He needs to let you grieve. Only time will help. When I was 13 my older brother died in a car crash at 19. It destroyed me. He was my hero. He gave me my first teddy bear. ( And started a life long love of them). When he dies I would go everywhere with it. My mom made me leave it at home one day to go to school and the dog got a hold of it. I was pissed and hurt. I fixed it and still have it 29 years later. Don't do anything you don't want or are not ready to do. Sorry for your lost.  NTA.", "NTA. What you have and what you want to part with is your decision. How is step-dad even related to your fiance?", "NTA \n\nAnd it's kinda creepy of him to ask.", "NTA and please check this out, helped me a LOT:\nhttps://www.griefrecoverymethod.com/", "wtf why does he even want that stuff 2nd hand they're not even valuables", "Well now.  I get his personal clothes etc however did you also save his leftover hamburger in the fridge?  Or stop driving his car? What about his toothpaste or toilet paper. You can mourn but not letting someone else use shampoo is a bit overboard.  Might be time to get some counseling.  You don\u2019t mention if you share a bathRoom?  It is not your house so you may have to move the stuff", "NTA also did you get an autopsy on him to see how he died? There\u2019s a possibility your stepdad killed him", "You and your late fiance had been mooching off your unemployed disabled mom and her unemployed husband for how long before he died? They were depleting their savings to support you while you saved up money? And you're mad because your step-dad needs some shampoo?
