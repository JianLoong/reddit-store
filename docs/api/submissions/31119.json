My fianc\u00e9 was literally the best guy i have ever met my soulmate and best relationship i have ever had and we were perfect for each other.  He was the most care free person I have ever met. We were both Sharing a house with my mom and step Dad as my step dad wasn't working and my mom is recently disabled not working either. My fianc\u00e9 and I both had jobs I am still with my company currently and we were squirreling away money to get a place of our own.  We were also paying all the bills at this home to help them out and we even used our squirrel fund to get my moms car out of repossession after they towed it for non-payment. My mom never told me she was so behind and was getting short term disability at the time so since him and I were covering bills I thought she was paying it.  I came home from work and found him passed away in our bed and this has been the hardest time in my life. I still cry almost everyday and getting out of bed to go to work and be productive at work and home is extremely difficult for me. Since he died I have not been able to part with any of his Belongings from his clothes to his bodywash and shampoo in the bathroom. Everything is were he left it. The only thing that I have cleared out Is his nightstand and dresser drawers because when he moved in I had to shove all my stuff in a few drawers I still have everything it's just in a box in our room. His hats our still on his side of the room on the wall where he left them. After he moved in, I had put command hooks on the wall and made him a little set up of his hats. Because he has so many and he loved it. And they are still there and all of his toiletries are where they were. My stepdad has asked me numerous times to give him or sell him His bathroom stuff such as body wash, shampoos etc and I say no I don't want to move it. Tonight he asked again and it's been really tough with Thanksgiving next week and he's been on my mind every second. So tonight I burst into tears and yelled at him that I can't understand why he can't leave it alone and stormed off. Now stepdad is mad and Is not talking to me.

I still have the toothbrush of my late husband in the cup where he left it 5 years ago. It\u2019s weird that your stepdad is being such a cheapskate. \n\nBesides smells are huge triggers. I wouldn\u2019t want another male living with me smelling like someone I loved.", "Uhhhh why the heck would anyone want to purchase toiletries this way? NTA", "I\u2019m so sorry. All I can tell you is it is TOTALLY NORMAL to not part ways with items of a loved one. My BFF from childhood, the last time I saw her had a drink in a glass jar she put in my fridge. For some reason, I could not throw it away. She passed away 4 months later. It took my 2 years to throw it away. It was a glass drink. I don\u2019t think i would ever be able to part with her personal items. Jesus, I couldn\u2019t even throw out an envelope addressed to me. \n\nYou stepdad is an AHole-", "NTA for not wanting to sell the stuff. However, if you share one bathroom, you should move the things into your room. Like you needed more room in your room, others may want room in common areas.", "First of all, I am so sorry for your loss\u2026 I can\u2019t even imagine going through this. \n\n2nd. NTA you are grieving and your stepdad is being weird\u2026 even worse than selling your fianc\u00e9\u2019s toiletries is to have your stepdad smelling like him. It\u2019s just weird.\n\nI do think that at some point for you to move on you will need to select a few items to keep for yourself and not keep the rest, or even better, move to a new place\u2026.. because while everything is exactly as he left it, everything you do at your house everyday its a reminder and might prevent you from eventually healing. That said, this is your own grief process, your are the one going through it and you will know when it\u2019s time.  You shouldn\u2019t be pushed to do it\u2026 I would maybe get some help maybe some grief counseling, but again, at your own pace\u2026", "Nta", "NTA \n\nAnd eff that guy.\n\nYou get to grieve in your time \n\nSo sorry you're going through this \n\nPeace", "NTA. Grieving is a very personal process. How you grieve and how long you grieve is unique to you. Eventually, you will be able to part with those items. For now, though, your stepdad needs to leave you alone about it because it is *your* decision when you're ready.", "NTA- Your stepdad is being very insensitive, seven months isn't enough time to mourn.", "NTA. Take all the time you need. I suspect your stepfather is just being cheap and doesn't understand your grief. Ignore him. \n\nIf you haven't already, maybe look into a group for grieving partners--there wil be people there that understand what you're going through because they've been through it themselves. Many of course will be older people but I've heard about groups specifically for young people that have lost their partners. <3", "NTA\n\nI would give him a $10 gift card so he can purchase his own damn shampoo and body wash. I don't mean this as a generous gesture but as a positive aggressive FU.", "NTA. Your stepdad is gross. Maybe he should use the money he was going to buy your dead fiance's personal items with to pay his own bills. If there's even remotely enough money in that squirrel fund, I recommend you find another tree sooner rather than later.", "NTA. You have your own grieving process. I too cannot understand why your stepdad can't just leave it and buy his own body wash.", "TA? No, not at all.   \n\n\nBut the outburst and clinging to nominal things like bathroom stuff are signs that you need some counseling for grief. Please get professional help.   \n\n\nKeep the hats, they're a nice reminder of him and of a nice thing you did for him. But the toiletries, and most of the clothes, those should be moved on when you are ready.", "NTA, treating a widow like something is wrong with them for not being ready to get rid of all their partner\u2019s things when it hasn\u2019t even been a year is heartless. My mom took 20+ years to get rid of some of my grandma\u2019s things. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "Update: my mom apologized to me this morning and said my stepdad said he was sorry and didn't realize I would get that upset he has not said anything to me personally just through her and idk if he actually said sorry or my mom was just trying to smooth things over", "NAH. So you can't part with his stuff, which is fine. But maybe seeing them in the bathroom everyday hurts your Mom and stepdad. So maybe try to just move those items into your room where they are out of sight.", "A lot of people Have asked why my step dad Would want my fianc\u00e9s stuff in the bathroom and he has never specifically said why but I think it's because it's just sitting there going un used. They are pretty new bottles I think my fianc\u00e9 had literally bought them just a few days prior. I know eventually I need to do something with his stuff clothes etc.  The bathroom stuff. I will probably end up giving away or throwing away when i'm ready. His clothes I  guess I would Probably donate them eventually cause I would want them to be of use to someone like at a homeless shelter or something not goodwill. I put his favorite Hoodie and flannel shirt and a dress shirt that I bought him for my company Christmas party last year that i made him wear. LOL he wasn't happy about dressing up super nice to be around lawyers and stuff but I wanted him to look nice. He was also nervous I think. But he looked so good in it. He worked in construction and as a handyman and I am a paralegal who dresses up and so had to get him something fancy for 1 night but I love that he went with me. I also have a box in our room with other personal items his watch I bought him for Christmas last year, cologne, wallet, etc other little things he had. His other clothes are packed up but I haven't done anything yet because just them being gone gone is hard and of course his hats are on the wall. But one day I will be ready to remove them just not yet.", "Why would she give him any money she already pays all the bills", "My stepdad is not related to my fianc\u00e9. My stepdad is married to my mom. My fianc\u00e9s dad died about 3 years ago and my dad died about 2 1/2 years ago. They weren't friends necessarily they got a long in a sense of being civil but my fianc\u00e9 did not like him necessarily.", "I think you should give the post a second read through. Doesn't seem like you did a great job on the first attempt.", "I took a few weeks off work after it first happened but I did go back 3 weeks later not because I wanted too but mostly because of finances. I do have a decent paying job but I paid for his memorial, urn, and etc and with my regular bills and loosing his income as well Unfortunately I could not take any more time off. My job did not rush me back or anything it was strictly because I have bills to pay. I also did take a 10 day cross country road trip with my best friend a month or 2 after his passing because me and my fianc\u00e9 originally had a 7 day trip in Miami planned a romantic getaway just the two of us as a birthday/ pre wedding getaway but after his passing I canceled it cause I didn't feel right going so my bestfriend and I drove to Montana instead. I have not seek counseling I have thought about it but I just haven't felt ready and maybe that's why I'm struggling alot. I have hospitalized twice since his death for panic attacks so severe I thought I was having a heart attack.", "I mean, it's probably more \"that crap has been in the bathroom for months, if we're not gonna throw it out, can someone at least use it?\" but then again, I am a very practical person.", "It is not weird at all. It is a way of feeling close to someone. If he had a favorite cologne that he wore you can always spritz a teddy bear and snuggle with it or his favorite shirt and wear it. I have done that on a few occasions myself. I wish I could tell you the hurt goes away. Even though it never really goes away, it does eventually morph into something more tolerable. You are in my heart OP. \ud83d\udc9c", "OP, my deepest condolences to you. I cannot imagine the pain you're experiencing. I pray time will lessen this hurt, and you find solace in your wonderful memories with him. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a", "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re hurting :( it probably doesn\u2019t mean anything, but this internet stranger will keep you in her prayers.", "I\u2019m just so sorry :( I had a very deep loss and I wasn\u2019t functional for a year. I had to take off work, began self harming; was hospitalized in the psych ward a couple of times. It will get better eventually and you will be happy again at some point. Grief is just very hard work and I\u2019m just so sorry you\u2019re hurting so badly. It\u2019s crazy how these deep hurts can even manifest themselves physically. It\u2019s like the hurt finds a place to go no matter how unusual it might seem. One way or another it wants to get out.", "I can see this. I would probably feel the same way about it, but I wouldn't continue to ask her after being rebuffed. It's clear that she's grieving, and that's a very personal process. The best thing Stepdad can do is tell her that *when* she's ready to get rid of the items, he would like them.", "It wouldn't occur to me in a million years to ask somebody who's SO past away if I could have their body wash. That's beyond \"practical\" and well into the realm of \"super weird and callous\"", "Nah u seem like a very cold person", "It could be that they are just really poor and cannot afford shampoo, etc.\n\nAs I read the story, his wife's car was repossessed and OP and fiance were covering a large chunk of the bills. I see nothing in the story that says creepy - more desperation.", "Oh, I never said it was a GOOD reaction, just guessing at a more reasonable angle. Only one shower in the house, 4 adults using it, limited shelf space for bodywash, shampoo, etc. I can see running out of space and being annoyed that there is a bunch of stuff not being used. Not that they should have said anything about it, and certainly not pester someone about buying/taking it.", "Empathy: Putting yourself in someone else's shoes.  \nYou don't have to agree with their emotions to try to understand them.\n\nAs for temperature, I usually run pretty hot, but if I've been sitting around for too long, my metabolism slows down.", "Yeah but then wouldn\u2019t he be asking for more expensive stuff? There are really cheap brands of body wash", "Not if he wants to sell the fianc\u00e9s stuff", "No \u2014if shory on money I can see where he is just thinking\u201dit\u2019s available ,it\u2019s free \u201c.Obviously no empathy though ."]}
