My fianc\u00e9 was literally the best guy i have ever met my soulmate and best relationship i have ever had and we were perfect for each other.  He was the most care free person I have ever met. We were both Sharing a house with my mom and step Dad as my step dad wasn't working and my mom is recently disabled not working either. My fianc\u00e9 and I both had jobs I am still with my company currently and we were squirreling away money to get a place of our own.  We were also paying all the bills at this home to help them out and we even used our squirrel fund to get my moms car out of repossession after they towed it for non-payment. My mom never told me she was so behind and was getting short term disability at the time so since him and I were covering bills I thought she was paying it.  I came home from work and found him passed away in our bed and this has been the hardest time in my life. I still cry almost everyday and getting out of bed to go to work and be productive at work and home is extremely difficult for me. Since he died I have not been able to part with any of his Belongings from his clothes to his bodywash and shampoo in the bathroom. Everything is were he left it. The only thing that I have cleared out Is his nightstand and dresser drawers because when he moved in I had to shove all my stuff in a few drawers I still have everything it's just in a box in our room. His hats our still on his side of the room on the wall where he left them. After he moved in, I had put command hooks on the wall and made him a little set up of his hats. Because he has so many and he loved it. And they are still there and all of his toiletries are where they were. My stepdad has asked me numerous times to give him or sell him His bathroom stuff such as body wash, shampoos etc and I say no I don't want to move it. Tonight he asked again and it's been really tough with Thanksgiving next week and he's been on my mind every second. So tonight I burst into tears and yelled at him that I can't understand why he can't leave it alone and stormed off. Now stepdad is mad and Is not talking to me.
