She agreed with me and I told her we shouldn\u2019t get any for my sister cause she wanted to make something else anyway.\n\nMy mom told me that maybe my sister would be hurt if we don\u2019t get her anything because she usually does that but I told her she should have asked if that was the case and we had already ordered by then anyway so it was not worth the effort. When we got back home it was around 8pm and my sister saw me holding a box of fries so she was saying how she\u2019s relieved we got food cause she\u2019s hungry and too tired.

Your sister did say to pick her something up if you guys got something. Your mom didn\u2019t have to listen to you, but it sounds to me like your sister tries so hard because you\u2019re actually the one treated with more favoritism. Why is your mom letting a 15 year old tell her what to do? She seemed to care more about appeasing you in the moment than making sure your sister has something to eat.", "YTA.   \n\nYou sound so fucking jealous of your sister.", "There was so much jealousy and hostility that you couldn't even text and ask your sister if she wanted you to bring her some takeout?  Your excuse that she wanted to cook something else is pretty flimsy.  How unfortunate that your mother went along with your efforts to make sure your sister didn't get food when she was hungry.\n\nThis was very unkind, mean behavior that was clearly intended to spite her.  \n\nYTA\n\nP.S.  The notion that your sister cooks breakfast and shares her school successes with your parents specifically to look better than you is absurd.  Everything your sister does is not about you.", "YTA, you made an effort to exclude your sister by not getting her food. It's 8 pm, and if you're going to stop to get you and your mom food, it's only right that you get her some. I understand that she acts better than you, but your parents don't treat her better. You're 15 you need to understand that just because she acts like that, and from what you said, it doesn't affect you. You don't need to actively exclude your sister. You are just jealous, so I'm going to have to go with YTA.", "YTA - Even when my sister would say she wanted to cook something, when I would go get take out I would not even think about not bringing something for her just in case.

Getting food for one kid and not the other is super unfair, especially when your reasoning is 'she was going to step up and make us all something anyway.' Oof. \n\nHonestly, you need to take a step back and ask yourself why you're treating your sister so badly. As others have commented, it seems pretty clear from the outside that you're jealous of her achievements and aren't sure how to handle it, so you're lashing out. You know it was a shitty move, otherwise you wouldn't be here asking about it. \n\nMy advice? Stop comparing yourself to your sister and work on your own life. If the mention of her achievements are so damaging to your calm, that's a signal that you need to buckle down and work on yourself. Tearing someone else down so they are at your level is tacky and immature. Sorry Bud, but there is some growing up that you need to do here. Soft YTA.", "YTA. But it\u2019s ok.

You wanted your sister to go hungry because she wants to please your parents. YTA.", "YTA and so is your mom.", "YTA.

You mom is the AH too", "YTA.\n\nI get the impression you're the Golden Child and your sister is trying to get the same level of affection from them that you get; that's why she makes sure to point out when she does stuff well and does extra stuff for them like make them breakfast.  No matter what she does, though, they don't acknowledge it.  The fact that your mom was fine with not getting food for your sister so she could eat as soon as you got home really says it all.

You are extremely immature.  You denied someone food???", "ESH. It sounds your sister has a big ego and some unhealthy competitive urge to outdo you at everything.\n\nwhile you are jealous/butthurt, and did this because you thought excluding her from something would knock her down a few pegs and put her in her place. \n\nShe\u2019s not entitled to takeout, so I don\u2019t think you owe her an apology, but I do think you should both take some space from each other for awhile, and you should re-evaluate your own behavior.", "Jesus Christ, both of you are assholes.

Giant Asshole.", "YTA.  And it\u2019s beyond me why your mother went along with your idea that your sister wouldn\u2019t want food at 8 pm, but would prefer to cook.   I hope your mother is a wake up to your antics now.", "YTA dick move", "You're 15 and self-centered and want everyone's approval, but you're not willing to admit it. Sibling rivalry is even worse because your sister does more for your parents' approval, and that upsets you. \n\nListen, there is no shame in wanting your parents' approval or having a good relationship with your sister, but you're at that age where you are fighting the world right now. Take a few deep breaths and realize it doesn't have to be a competition.", "YTA. The fact you can't see that is nuts. I get it, my siblings and I used to do this shit, but we also knew we were being dicks.", "Imagine being such a lack luster child and expecting BETTER treatment. The math didn't add up, makes sense since your sister probs gets better math grades too", "You would rather let your little sister go hungry, even knowing you live in a household where food insecurity is the norm? YTA and honest to Pete, you\u2019re incredibly cruel.", "You and your mom were out to get some food, including picking up cheese for your sister to MAKE food at home, knowing that the house was empty of food and groceries. Instead, you bought food FOR YOURSELF and not even her ingredients. \n\nYes, OP you're the AH (and your mom a bit for believing you and not using common sense, she should make her her favorite meal) for making your sister go hungry.\n\nYou should apologize.", "Perhaps, OP, your sister works extra hard for your Parents because she\u2019s thoughtful and loves your parents. In your own words, they don\u2019t treat you any different, but that\u2019s what YOU see. I know that my Parents treated my Brothers very different. They expected more from me because I was older and, I suspect, because I was a girl. The expectations were different and I\u2019m sure my Brothers would agree. As soon as I moved out, and chores and cooking became their responsibility, they were sorely lacking in knowledge and ability. Don\u2019t let that happen to you. Ask your sister to teach you what she does around the house and what her responsibilities are. And then assist her! You might be surprised and learn a lot in the process.", "I mean, YTA - lightly. It\u2019s a pretty immature response to manipulate your mom out of getting your sister food as some kind of payback for her doing good in life and talking about it. It doesn\u2019t sound like your sister is some mastermind. It\u2019s really normal to be proud of your grades and want validation from your parents. It\u2019s also really normal to cook breakfast and make some for the people around you. \n\nBut honestly, you\u2019re still just a kid. Your mom is the one at fault here. She should\u2019ve known better than to allow you to talk her out of getting dinner for your sister. \n\nAlso, based on the limited info I know, I\u2019m inclined to believe your sister when she claims she\u2019s mistreated. Your sister explicitly asked for mac and cheese *or* food wherever you went out. Y\u2019all knew there was no food at home. You and your mom chose not to bring her back food. That\u2019s\u2026 not great. \n\nI know this sounds drastic, but a sit down talk with your mom and sister - or even a therapist - might be really helpful for your family. You feeling \u201cshown up\u201d by your sister making breakfast for herself and your parents is a sign that you need to talk through your feelings about your sister. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s doing anything wrong.", "YTA. Cellphones exist. Call her to make sure. But no, you felt you had to one up your sister. I have a feeling you're projecting.", "YTA. You knew perfectly well that your sister was hungry and wanted you to pick up food while you were out. You owe her an apology and a hamburger. And I hope your mother realizes how spiteful you are.", "YTA...\n\nI hope your sister realizes what shitty family she has and leaves. You are obviously jealous of your sister's success, and it shows. \n\nYour mom is more of an asshole in terms of letting you manipulate her to not getting her straving daughter food.", "YTA I\u2019d say grow up but you\u2019re a child. You\u2019re basically obsessed with your sister because if you weren\u2019t, none of this would matter. Messing with food is also disgusting behavior.", "YTA.\n\nYour sister is a considerate person and you aren\u2019t so instead of trying to better yourself, you decide to tear her down. \n\nGrow up.", "Yeah. YTA and an unreliable narrator at that. \n\nMaybe she makes breakfast sometimes because she's a nice person?", "YTA why do you care so much if your sister wants to help out around the house more then you? Or that she likes school and wants to share what happens with the parents? You sound jealous that your sister does more then you and actually contributes while you sit and sulk.", "YTA you should have asked. I would despise my brothers if they did what you did and actively made sure I had no food when everyone else did. You know you acted like a piece of shxx to her and you should say sorry and mean it.", "Soft YTA because you sound like a typical 15yo sibling, which you are, but it was still a nasty move. However, your mum is the parent, so I'm not sure why she left it to you to decide if your sister will get food too?", "Oh man.  YTA.  And your mom should have just called or texted your sister and asked.  Sounds like a fun family.", "According to you, your sister said to get her some cheese, but if you guys were picking up food, to get her some too. YTA because you knowingly excluded your sister.", "YTA. I\u2019m inclined to think your sister is right. What parent, what GOOD parent, at dinner time, would agree with their bratty child that it\u2019s okay to only buy one child dinner and not the other. You needed groceries, you not only talked your mom out of them, but talked her into getting food for you only. YTA and so is your mom.", "YTA. Neither of you couldn't have called her and asked if she wanted food as well? Idiots...", "YTA. \n\nYour sister is just being a good daughter so there's nothing wrong with what she's doing. I guess is kinda hard for you to see it, but you're fifteen, I know it sucks when people tell you this (and I hated it so much myself), but: You'll understand when you grow up. \n\nYou're a teenager, thinking and doing things teenagers do. And while I do think it was extremely cruel not buying her food, I would've done the same at that age. So yeah, YTA. But I don't think you'll understand why yet.", "YTA", ">My sister told my mom get her some cheese so she can make herself mac n cheese and in case we got something to get that instead\n\n\"If you get food, get me that instead\".\n\nYou didn't. I'm not gonna say anyone is the ahole, but in this particular situation, you and your mom both suck. She's an adult and could have made the decision to get your sister food regardless of what your punk ass 15 year old self said.\n\nSounds like y'all take sibling rivalry to a whole new level. I'm sure 10 years from now holiday get togethers will be super comfortable.", "ESH, why is mom going along with this? She\u2019s the adult in this situation and should be making sure both kids have food.", "YTA... she specifocally asked you to pick up something, and you turned it into a power play using your mom as a pawn...\n\nGood thing you are 15... you have time to learn to be better...", "YTA. Purely by what I deduce from your story, it sounds like your sister is being treated like less of a person/child than you, which is why she is trying to make it up by talking about things she did, good grades, etc.... she is TRYING TO BE SEEN! She is doing everything she can to try and get the attention from her parents that she deserves.\r  \n\r  \nYou don't see that because, if I read the situation correctly, you are the golden child (potentially because you are the Benjamin of the family). You got a superiority complex (who knows, maybe even narcisistic tendencies) and therefore you WOULD say your sister is just jealous...because of your position in the family, you don't see her problems/issues. \r  \n\r  \nAlso: a) why was there no food in the house? b) why did you not have food all day? And c) why on EARTH would go and buy groceries for food for your sister and then stay out until 8PM?! Are you bloody kidding me?! You and your mum don't seem to care about your sister/her daughter! If no one has eaten all day, then you couldn't possibly consider your sister being hungry too, yet you stay out and eat out while your sister is still hungry at home?! You come home at 8pm and THEN the food still needs to be made. And then SHE is jealous of YOU? Yeah she is, but NOT in the way you think! You sound like an entitled brat.", "Yta. You left her out on purpose.  It was mean and unnecessary.  She shouldn't have had to ask if you knew she hadn't eaten.  You are just as pathetic as she is.", "YTA. Sounds like you just wanted to get back at your sister.", "The way you talk about your sister, it is dripping with spite. So it is obvious that you really went out of your way to make sure your sister didn't yet any food.\n\nAbsolutely, YTA.", "YTA. You say she should have asked, but she did ask your mom to pick something up so she could make food or get her something over whatever she got. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty weird you think that your sister sharing stuff with her own parents and being nice to them by making breakfast sometimes is all about you and her trying to make you look bad. Maybe she\u2019s proud of her accomplishments and likes to care for her parents? Get over yourself, dude.", "OP literally convinced his mom not to buy food for his sister, knowing full well there was no food at home. OP YTA and a little shit too.", "YTA", ">Everything your sister does is not about you.\n\nTHAT part.", "You just know from this kid\u2019s attitude that his perception of equal treatment means he\u2019s highly favoured.", "Oh and you didn't actually buy the ingredient she needed to make the dinner she mentioned...so you and your mom are both ah", "***he knew his sister was hungry and had no food at home", "This! Seriously, wtf?! I'd be so pissed if one child of mine treated the other like this. OP's mom is oblivious af and easily manipulated.", "Maybe the local grocery stores and restaurants are all refusing service to AHs.", "Hey, he\u2019s still 15. Let\u2019s be nice. If we insult him, he\u2019s not gonna listen.", "You meant YTA", "Insulting him isn\u2019t gonna help him understand what he did wrong.
