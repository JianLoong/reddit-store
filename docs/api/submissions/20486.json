She agreed with me and I told her we shouldn\u2019t get any for my sister cause she wanted to make something else anyway.\n\nMy mom told me that maybe my sister would be hurt if we don\u2019t get her anything because she usually does that but I told her she should have asked if that was the case and we had already ordered by then anyway so it was not worth the effort. When we got back home it was around 8pm and my sister saw me holding a box of fries so she was saying how she\u2019s relieved we got food cause she\u2019s hungry and too tired.

Your sister did say to pick her something up if you guys got something. Your mom didn\u2019t have to listen to you, but it sounds to me like your sister tries so hard because you\u2019re actually the one treated with more favoritism. Why is your mom letting a 15 year old tell her what to do? She seemed to care more about appeasing you in the moment than making sure your sister has something to eat.", "YTA.   \n\nYou sound so fucking jealous of your sister.", "There was so much jealousy and hostility that you couldn't even text and ask your sister if she wanted you to bring her some takeout?  Your excuse that she wanted to cook something else is pretty flimsy.  How unfortunate that your mother went along with your efforts to make sure your sister didn't get food when she was hungry.\n\nThis was very unkind, mean behavior that was clearly intended to spite her.  \n\nYTA\n\nP.S.  The notion that your sister cooks breakfast and shares her school successes with your parents specifically to look better than you is absurd.  Everything your sister does is not about you.", "YTA, you made an effort to exclude your sister by not getting her food. It's 8 pm, and if you're going to stop to get you and your mom food, it's only right that you get her some. I understand that she acts better than you, but your parents don't treat her better. You're 15 you need to understand that just because she acts like that, and from what you said, it doesn't affect you. You don't need to actively exclude your sister. You are just jealous, so I'm going to have to go with YTA.", "YTA - Even when my sister would say she wanted to cook something, when I would go get take out I would not even think about not bringing something for her just in case.

Getting food for one kid and not the other is super unfair, especially when your reasoning is 'she was going to step up and make us all something anyway.' Oof. \n\nHonestly, you need to take a step back and ask yourself why you're treating your sister so badly. As others have commented, it seems pretty clear from the outside that you're jealous of her achievements and aren't sure how to handle it, so you're lashing out. You know it was a shitty move, otherwise you wouldn't be here asking about it. \n\nMy advice? Stop comparing yourself to your sister and work on your own life. If the mention of her achievements are so damaging to your calm, that's a signal that you need to buckle down and work on yourself. Tearing someone else down so they are at your level is tacky and immature. Sorry Bud, but there is some growing up that you need to do here. Soft YTA.", "YTA. But it\u2019s ok.

You wanted your sister to go hungry because she wants to please your parents. YTA.", "YTA and so is your mom.", "YTA.

You mom is the AH too", "YTA.\n\nI get the impression you're the Golden Child and your sister is trying to get the same level of affection from them that you get; that's why she makes sure to point out when she does stuff well and does extra stuff for them like make them breakfast.  No matter what she does, though, they don't acknowledge it.  The fact that your mom was fine with not getting food for your sister so she could eat as soon as you got home really says it all.

You are extremely immature.  You denied someone food???", "ESH. It sounds your sister has a big ego and some unhealthy competitive urge to outdo you at everything.\n\nwhile you are jealous/butthurt, and did this because you thought excluding her from something would knock her down a few pegs and put her in her place. \n\nShe\u2019s not entitled to takeout, so I don\u2019t think you owe her an apology, but I do think you should both take some space from each other for awhile, and you should re-evaluate your own behavior.", "Jesus Christ, both of you are assholes.

In your own words, they don\u2019t treat you any different, but that\u2019s what YOU see. I know that my Parents treated my Brothers very different. They expected more from me because I was older and, I suspect, because I was a girl. The expectations were different and I\u2019m sure my Brothers would agree. As soon as I moved out, and chores and cooking became their responsibility, they were sorely lacking in knowledge and ability. Don\u2019t let that happen to you.

Your sister explicitly asked for mac and cheese *or* food wherever you went out. Y\u2019all knew there was no food at home. You and your mom chose not to bring her back food.

Purely by what I deduce from your story, it sounds like your sister is being treated like less of a person/child than you, which is why she is trying to make it up by talking about things she did, good grades, etc.... she is TRYING TO BE SEEN! She is doing everything she can to try and get the attention from her parents that she deserves.\r  \n\r  \nYou don't see that because, if I read the situation correctly, you are the golden child (potentially because you are the Benjamin of the family). You got a superiority complex (who knows, maybe even narcisistic tendencies) and therefore you WOULD say your sister is just jealous...because of your position in the family, you don't see her problems/issues. \r  \n\r  \nAlso: a) why was there no food in the house? b) why did you not have food all day? And c) why on EARTH would go and buy groceries for food for your sister and then stay out until 8PM?! Are you bloody kidding me?! You and your mum don't seem to care about your sister/her daughter! If no one has eaten all day, then you couldn't possibly consider your sister being hungry too, yet you stay out and eat out while your sister is still hungry at home?! You come home at 8pm and THEN the food still needs to be made. And then SHE is jealous of YOU? Yeah she is, but NOT in the way you think! You sound like an entitled brat.", "Yta.

She got full scholarships at school while i had to constantly listen to our parents complain about all the money I was costing them because I wasn't smart enough. My sister was the eldest sibling who had to take on more responsibility, and in her eyes I was probably the spoilt younger child. Our mother worked alot and our dad was very sexist and 'traditional'. He expected her to do the cooking and cleaning in the house when our mother was away and rarely asked me. My sister took this out on me a lot, and did some pretty bad stuff to me, and I held a lot of hate and resentment against her. But once I got to around your age, I realised I have to be the one to support her when our parents didn't. It was hard overcoming the years of pain and trauma my sister caused me, but I made myself understand she's not to blame and it was how our parents raised us. I made sure I helped as much as I could the nights my mother was working, and if my dad ever tried to make her do chores I volunteered instead.

What mother doesn\u2019t buy their kid a dinner when there isn\u2019t any food in the house?  \n\nI struggle to believe this is even true.  The 15M probably made this up in a poor attempt to get people to support him for being a shit.", "Because one child is probably favored (OP) over the other. And different kids have different personalities.", "Because thats not how it works with parents like that. Different people react different ways. The sister strains to talk about herself and so stuff to make them hold her in higher esteem, but ops discovered that he can achieve it by stepping on the sister, so to speak. And in those cases it tends to keep going like that because the one who *is* getting what they want recognises that if they stop, both/all the kids will be treated equally, and that means they get treated the objectively worse way that their siblings are, and they dont want that.", "You can make that claim but we weren't there so we don't have context also I'm not defending fact it was shitty to do even if she did mean get cheese instead if it was me I woulda got her something just incase but either way we can't be 100% on what she meant as we weren't there", "What???  You're misunderstanding my point.  I meant as if   someone wouldn't just buy groceries, and then not use some of those groceries to feed themselves when they need to eat *that night*.  I didn't mean like buying a day's worth of food, I did mean one would normally buy a week's worth of food.  \n\nOP implied, by how he wrote his post and how most people would phrase it, getting groceries *for another day*, as in doing the actual shopping on another day.  The way you're interpreting this, makes it sound like the sister had other options *if groceries had been bought*, and that her reaction was over the top.  I doubt that.  Her reaction fits more of someone who hasn't eaten all day, and will continue to not eat until someone eventually buys food, which is hell if her stomach is already hurting from hunger.", "I meant that the sister wouldn't have a fit and wait till another day to eat any of the food they would've bought, when she could just make something with the food provided.", "She asked them to buy cheese, they screwed her over by not buying cheese.  They had no cheese at home, only unflavored macaroni.  Even if that's technically food, that's not a decent meal.", "Sounds like a golden child if mom listens to him like his word is gospel.", "Right? Phones exist. A text takes 2 seconds."]}
