Your sister did say to pick her something up if you guys got something. Your mom didn\u2019t have to listen to you, but it sounds to me like your sister tries so hard because you\u2019re actually the one treated with more favoritism. Why is your mom letting a 15 year old tell her what to do? She seemed to care more about appeasing you in the moment than making sure your sister has something to eat.", "YTA.   \n\nYou sound so fucking jealous of your sister.", "There was so much jealousy and hostility that you couldn't even text and ask your sister if she wanted you to bring her some takeout?  Your excuse that she wanted to cook something else is pretty flimsy.  How unfortunate that your mother went along with your efforts to make sure your sister didn't get food when she was hungry.\n\nThis was very unkind, mean behavior that was clearly intended to spite her.  \n\nYTA\n\nP.S.  The notion that your sister cooks breakfast and shares her school successes with your parents specifically to look better than you is absurd.  Everything your sister does is not about you.", "YTA, you made an effort to exclude your sister by not getting her food. It's 8 pm, and if you're going to stop to get you and your mom food, it's only right that you get her some. I understand that she acts better than you, but your parents don't treat her better. You're 15 you need to understand that just because she acts like that, and from what you said, it doesn't affect you. You don't need to actively exclude your sister. You are just jealous, so I'm going to have to go with YTA.", "YTA - Even when my sister would say she wanted to cook something, when I would go get take out I would not even think about not bringing something for her just in case. She probably felt very lonely when she saw you and your mom arrive with food that wasn\u2019t for her.", "YTA  \nThe whole thing about you, your sister and thinking that she wants to \"look better\" doesnt matter at all.  \n\n\nYou knew that your sister was hungry! She told you that if you got something, she would like something too! and still you chose to be petty and tell your mom, she didnt need any!  \nObviously your mom feels guilty and so should you, because it was the WRONG thing to do!  \nGo apologise to your sister", "\"Thankfully they don't treat her better and make sure to treat us equally\"\n\nYeah, 'equally', except for when you hound your mom to treat HER unequally. Getting food for one kid and not the other is super unfair, especially when your reasoning is 'she was going to step up and make us all something anyway.' Oof. \n\nHonestly, you need to take a step back and ask yourself why you're treating your sister so badly. As others have commented, it seems pretty clear from the outside that you're jealous of her achievements and aren't sure how to handle it, so you're lashing out. You know it was a shitty move, otherwise you wouldn't be here asking about it. \n\nMy advice? Stop comparing yourself to your sister and work on your own life. If the mention of her achievements are so damaging to your calm, that's a signal that you need to buckle down and work on yourself. Tearing someone else down so they are at your level is tacky and immature. Sorry Bud, but there is some growing up that you need to do here. Soft YTA.", "YTA. But it\u2019s ok. You just sound like a spiteful 15 year old kid that insists on making everything about themselves.", "Yta what is it about younger sibling\u2019s and their victim complex? My little brother is the same. Grow up.", "YTA. So immature.", "YTA - of course you would know she'd be cut by this... just like you would have been if it's the other way around.  \n\nYou're just justifying it with all the back story.", "YTA you suck op", "Such a princess you are! You wanted your sister to go hungry because she wants to please your parents. YTA.", "YTA and so is your mom.", "YTA. You\u2019re so jealous of her, and pretty narcissistic to think that the reason she\u2019s so impressive is just to spite you\u2026 haha. Your parents are also total AHs for humoring your childish attempts to manipulate them to hurt her", "YTA and so is your mom for listening to you.", "YTA BUT why did the mom listen to you about not getting the sister food? You mom is the AH too", "YTA.\n\nI get the impression you're the Golden Child and your sister is trying to get the same level of affection from them that you get; that's why she makes sure to point out when she does stuff well and does extra stuff for them like make them breakfast.  No matter what she does, though, they don't acknowledge it.  The fact that your mom was fine with not getting food for your sister so she could eat as soon as you got home really says it all.   She didn't even think to call to see if she'd like a burger as soon as you got home instead of having to wait for grocieries to arrive then start cooking.  You and your parents are AHs.", "YTA", "YTA. You knew she didn\u2019t have food and refused to get her any even though it wouldn\u2019t even have involved getting out of your car. And don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t have a cell phone you could have used to ask her. In any case, treat your sister better. You\u2019ll be happy to have a good relationship with a loving sibling when you\u2019re older", "Didn't she specifically told that if you guys were to buy food, you should buy it for her as well instead of the cheese? Then you proceed to convince your mom to buy her NO FOOD nor get groceries and cheese so she could cook? HUGE YTA.", "YTA and your mom as the adult is YTA.", "YTA, but why tf is your mother taking instructions from her dipshit 15yo son?? She should be making sure neither of her kids go hungry, not just feeding the whiny one.", "What? You had no food at home, and you and your mother went out for food, and brought none for your sister? You and your mother are definitely AHs. I don't blame your sister for feeling insecure.", "Were you shopping with your mom when you got the food?", "Seriously? You couldn't call her and ask her before you got to the burger place or while you were there? \n\nI can't believe your mom didn't get her food. \n\nYou knew there was nothing to eat at home and that it was later than you planned to be home.  \n\nYou really need to grow up and.focus on yourself instead of worrying about sis. \n\nYou gave no information that indicates she is a golden child and you are the scapegoat and you actually said you parents treat you the same.  YTA.", "This sounds made up. \nIf IS true, you're a jerk because you just wanted to upset your sister. I don't buy the, \"she wanted to make something instead.' And your mom is a jerk for not being the grown up and getting your sister food.", "You\u2019re a horrible sister", "YTA. You are extremely immature.  You denied someone food???", "ESH. It sounds your sister has a big ego and some unhealthy competitive urge to outdo you at everything.\n\nwhile you are jealous/butthurt, and did this because you thought excluding her from something would knock her down a few pegs and put her in her place. \n\nShe\u2019s not entitled to takeout, so I don\u2019t think you owe her an apology, but I do think you should both take some space from each other for awhile, and you should re-evaluate your own behavior.", "Jesus Christ, both of you are assholes. Your sister sucks for being egotistical and trying to show off everything, and you suck for making your mom not bring something home for her.
