Your 2yo can absolutely set boundaries about being filmed and you are correct that it isn't okay to keep putting your family at risk for clout. Not to mention violating the privacy of the other families.\n\nI hope you're able to protect your kids from her. This route is thing makes me feel ill.", "NTA as everyone else said, but also if she can\u2019t figure out how to blur faces then she isn\u2019t going to be able to edit videos and make a channel. It\u2019s a video editing thing anyone can learn, so she\u2019s being willfully ignorant regarding that.", "Id be speaking to a lawyer. NTA. Protect your kids.", "NTA this is intrusive to the kids, they can't really consent. The whole culture around social media has gotten out of control. It's really sad in general. I would say both of you should be comfortable with it before she does this. It's not healthy IMO. Good luck.", "NTA I wouldn't be surprised if she has a channel already in secret. Small kids cannot consent to that level of exposure. And your fianc\u00e9e should respect your daughter's choices for herself. Mommy doesn't know best.", "NTA OP, good lord a two year old child is telling your fiance to not to film her but she keeps on doing it because \"oh sweetie you're just a dumb two year old and are not allowed to say NO to Mommy.\" Your fiance has also engaged in a very reckless practice when it comes to this \"family vlogging\" garbage, and that's all the \"fun\" of the practice with absolutely no regard for the safety of her family or others she forces to be in her videos. Your fiance is constantly trampling on other people's boundaries by recording them when they expressly tell her no. The fact that she has video of minors belonging to other families on her instagram page despite being told by the family of those minors not to post that video footage without blurring the faces of the minors may very well be breaking the law. Not to mention, we're talking about recording on and in a private business which is illegal. \n\nTo recap OP, your fiancee is committing the following mistakes:\n\n1. Recording minors without their consent;\n2. Uploading video footage of minors to the internet without their consent;\n3. Recording videos of people without their consent;\n4. Uploading video footage of people and their children without their consent;\n5. Not respecting repeated requests to blur out faces of other people's children in the video footage she uploads;\n6. Uploading images and video of children on the internet where it's readily obvious where those children live and/or spend their free time as part of their daily lives;\n7. Recording and uploading video footage of your lives in such a reckless way that it puts out sensitive, personal information about your family that no one should want out there on the internet and social media. \n\nAnd when confronted about this reckless and illegal behavior how does your fiancee respond? She accuses you of being excessive, controlling, and manipulative for trying to keep her from going so far overboard with her asinine obsession that it puts your family in danger. OP you need to seriously reconsider marrying this woman because she is obsessed with putting every facet of her and her family's lives out there for everyone to see and she couldn't give a shit less about anyone who disagrees or says otherwise. You also need to be prepared to take this woman to court to fight for custody of your son and daughter because I promise you that she is not going to stop recording them even if BOTH of them tell her no. This is toxic behavior, and can be extremely damaging for those children. This is not the kind of lifestyle choice that children should be a part of, let alone forced to be a part of.", "You're NTA for not wanting to air your entire life in public. You're also doing them a giant favor from the ages of like... now until they're 18.\n\nIf my kid had friends with parents who were vloggers that tried to upload video of me or my family without my consent regularly, I would do whatever it took to make them stop including contacting their workplaces. \n\nI would purposely never let my child be in a situation where they would be recorded like this, which in your situation means your wife (and by association you) would never be permitted into my house.\n\nMaybe she's doing them a favor and they will grow up to murder the internet.", "NTA. Your wife is disrespecting the consent of several people, putting your family and other children at risk by not following basic online safety protocols, and forcing everyone in her life into a situation they don't want to be a part of. If she wants to film things about the family's life she can do that. Plenty of vloggers film things like what they eat in a day, trips to the park, and holidays without ever showing anyone's face. What she's doing is very dangerous. Not only can people track where your kids go, but she can be sued for showing the faces of other children *especially* after being asked by parents to blur their faces. She doesn't need to be a family blogger if she has no respect for her family's wishes and doesn't want to take the effort to learn how to ensure their online safety.", "NTA.\n\nThis is pretty clear-cut.  You don't have to agree to being filmed, period.  We shouldn't have to get into legalities about where you have an \"expectation of privacy\" because you should have an expectation of basic human decency.  If someone doesn't want to be filmed or photographed, you should not do it, especially in their home.\n\nWhen it comes to your children, you each have an equal say.  And this isn't Hollywood, but there's several cases of reality-show stars who can't have their children filmed due to restraining orders from exes.  Meaning that the court, in the best interest of the children, does not allow them to be exploited for viewers.\n\nPart of the problem here is that she's claiming this is for posterity, and yet posting online now.  I wonder what she would say to filming with a digital camera (not cell phone or tablet) and storing the footage on a hard drive rather than in the cloud.", "NTA. I agree with you, it does sound very intrusive to all of your lives and definitely isn\u2019t healthy to be recording the kids like that especially at their ages, it\u2019s quite worrying if she doesn\u2019t realise or even doesn\u2019t care and is forcing it on them..very self absorbed really. I understand the importance of videoing and photographing to capture great memories of the kids to look back at but definitely not in a vlog like way every day. \n\nDoes she have other ways that she come off as selfish/narcissistic? I\u2019m hoping that she\u2019s a great mum in every other way and that maybe she\u2019s just got a little caught up in the idea of having a social media lifestyle and will gradually realise that it isn\u2019t healthy especially if it\u2019s all to present a certain \u2018image\u2019 to people.\n\nMaybe show her examples of how family vlogging has gone wrong and caused harm to kids and also the dangers of putting certain information about yourself online. But obviously do it in a gentle way. Does she have friends that have public social media accounts and posts their kids? Just wondering if that\u2019s why she thinks it\u2019s normal and something that she needs to compete with", "NTA but she sure is. \nIt\u2019s not only that she stomps all over your daughter\u2019s boundaries but also every other person that asked her to stop with this. She is setting herself up for serious consequences and conflicts with adults who can sue her. \nIf any of the parents at the daycare found out she posted their children without consent and even worse, ignoring their requests to blur faces, that is serious legal trouble right there. \nShe is forcing her wannabe influencer lifestyle on you and the children, completely disregarding safety and boundaries.", "NTA\n\nA 2yo is old enough to set boundaries, because they're old enough to communicate what they do and don't like. Now is the time to respect them, so they grow up not learning that their boundaries aren't worth respecting.\n\nAs far as recording in public, sure but as soon as she tries to make money on a video where she doesn't have a signed release from people in the video... she's gonna learn real quick how much that can cost. \n\nIt sounds like she's obsessed with becoming social media famous and is unfortunately tied down by at least 2 people who don't want anything to do with it. \n\nYou will need to get better at setting boundaries and enforcing consequences.", "NTA- your fianc\u00e9 is being inconsiderate and selfish. It\u2019s weird that *she* is choosing this hill to die on.", "NTA - she sounds unhinged, and desperately needs some therapy. \n\nSet up a couples session and then also 1-on-1 therapy for her, and if she won\u2019t do 1 on 1 unless you also do then fine. She needs to talk to a professional about this obsession she has with wanting to showcase every minute of her life, it\u2019s really unfair to you and your children and It\u2019s baffling to me she doesn\u2019t get that.", "NTA, your wife has some serious issues with respecting other peoples boundaries. If the daycare and the parents find your wife's post they can force instagram to take the videos down. I would strongly suggest couples counseling and if she wants to separate a legally binding agreement that the children are not to be filmed and posted on line without your consent.", "NTA. She would do my head in behaving like that", "Absolutely NTA. Your wife isn't respecting you as a spouse or as a person with this very invasive behavior. Plus showing the faces of all the kids (even when she was asked not to) can get her in serious trouble with the parents. Plus showing the daycare can fall under legal stuff since she didn't get permission. These videos of can be seen by people who can be potentially harm to not only you and your family, but all the ones she filmed without their consent. You both need to talk about this seriously.

No social media posts with personal details. No names. Minors need as close to *no* digital footprint as possible.
