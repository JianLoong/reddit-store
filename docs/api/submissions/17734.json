And as a parent, if you can easily afford it, you either help them or you don't, but you don't do this interest and equity stuff.\n\n1. Do you need equity in a house?

You don't have to just give her the money, but treating it as an investment opportunity is a bit of a shit go.

First off, stop calling this a loan. This is an investment, pure and simple. Also, the method of investment is truly predatory, in a much worse way than even the most predatory bank out there. Why do I say that? Let me break down your offer, and show you:  \n\n\nYou are offering to fund the investment only in the down payment. As such, you are not involved in the interest of the loan, with the exception of contributing to a lower interest rate. Your kids are still responsible for 100% of the interest of the loan. With real numbers, you could break it down like this:   \n\n\nTotal Home Value: $400,000.00\n\nDown Payment: $100,000.00 (25%)\n\nInterest Rate: 6.7% (on the $300,000.00 loan)\n\nBy the end of the loan (30 yr term), your kids will have paid $396,900.22 in interest, plus the $300k principle, meaning a total of $696,900.22 on the loan that you did not pay a dime towards. So, by the time the loan is paid off, your kids have paid out nearly 7x what you invested. For them to pay you 25% of the sale price, when your effective stake in the investment is now more towards the 10% mark is predatory.\n\nAs someone who is \"not rich\", you should still understand that interest is always the largest portion of any loan, especially on a high-dollar and long-term loan like a mortgage. By not contributing to the interest, your \"investment\" or \"stake\" loses value with each interest payment. Of course, if you are convincing other people to do this sort of deal on a regular basis, that explains your level of income, but is very clearly incredibly scummy.\n\nWhat you are actually doing is investing in real estate, and using your children's ignorance of how loans and investments work as the vehicle to get rich. Frankly, I hope you kick the bucket before they sell the houses. Even my own dad, the most penny-pinching Scrooge of a person I know let my wife and i buy our house cash on an interest free loan from him to avoid the predatory practices of bank loans. All he required was a written contract for the payment schedule.

It can't be a true loan because the bank will be the lien holder.  If payments stopped the bank is getting the house.  If the father isn't on the title this is all semantics.\n\nSecond, your kids are going to inherit whatever you don't spend, so this money may have come to them down the road (probably several decades down the road).

If you put in $200k on an $800k house now and they have a $600k mortgage that they pay down to $400k over the next fifteen years and then they sell for 1.6 million, their net \"profit\" would be 1.2 million (1.6 - 500k remaining mortgage). With this statement, you would be expecting $200k + $300k as 25% of the net profit, which is more than 25% of the value of the house when it's sold, which would be $400k.\n\nI don't think it's necessarily unreasonable to ask for 25% ownership, but it's much more nuanced because are you going to pay 25% taxes and insurance and maintenance? Those costs don't change based on the mortgage amount. It would be more \"fair\" to reduce your percentage ownership yearly based on the fixed costs associated with the property value if you're not paying the ongoing expenses of owning the house. If taxes and insurance and maintenance are $20k per year, your part to keep this whole \"investment\" fair would be $5k. At the very least that should be deducted from your profit when it sells, so in the above scenario where $400k would be the 25% ownership share when it sells, they would pay you back 400k - 5k\u00d715, so 325k. This assumes a set tax and insurance + maintenance rate. For maintenance, it's things like siding/ paint/ roof, etc, not appliances or whatever. That would be a more \"fair\" way to handle this. \n\nAlso, if both kids took you up on your offer and bought their forever homes, do you plan to address the difference when it comes to inheritance? Say your son only gets $150k and daughter $250k and neither ever sales. I'm assuming your portion ownership will me gifted to the kid who owns the house, so will your son get an additional $100k in assets? Or maybe he should get more because your 25% ownership in his house might only be worth $300k when you pass but your 25% ownership in your daughter's house might be worth $750k. If you are a listed owner, that's there could be tax and estate implications. \n\nI think there's a reasonable way this can be done, I just don't think you've actually worked out the details very well and you are being greedy. My hope when my kids are grown is to be able to sell our bigger family home and buy myself a smaller home in a cheaper city and another smaller home (preferably 2) for my children to live in and they only have to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance, but I would still own the home and if they choose to move out likely turn it into rental property instead of selling.", "If you\u2019re such a saint, why are you even posting here?", "I think you should re read it \n\nI interpreted it differently", "That's a predatory lending scheme you've got going there.\n\nYour daughter is right.

That means after 5 years, the son would pay an additional $150k towards the mortgage, but only pay off $26k of the mortgage principal (since early payments are mostly interest). At average property tax rates of 1.08% plus reasonable maintenance expense, the son probably pays another $10k in expenses per year or $50k after 5 years. In total, the son has put in $200k initially, $124k in mortgage interest, $26k in mortgage principal, and $50k of expenses = $400k total.\n\nNow say the house sells for $1M as OP suggested. The $1M first pays back the remaining mortgage principle of $374k, leaving $626k to the \u201cinvestors.\u201d In OPs example, he gets 25% of $1M, so $250k, which leaves $376k for the son.\n\nWell look at that.

The interest in not typically paid in cash, but accrued, which means the value owed to the investor builds up over time.\n\nMaturity Date: Convertible notes carry a maturity date, at which the notes are due and payable to the investors if they have not already converted to equity. Some convertible notes have an automatic conversion at maturity.\n\nConversion Provisions: The primary purpose of a convertible note is that it will convert into equity at some point in the future.
