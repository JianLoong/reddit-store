And as a parent, if you can easily afford it, you either help them or you don't, but you don't do this interest and equity stuff.\n\n1. Do you need equity in a house?

You don't have to just give her the money, but treating it as an investment opportunity is a bit of a shit go.

This mixture is a source of ambiguity to me. What if they pay the loan back in full? Would you still have equity? What if they sell the house at a loss?

First off, stop calling this a loan. This is an investment, pure and simple. Also, the method of investment is truly predatory, in a much worse way than even the most predatory bank out there. Why do I say that? Let me break down your offer, and show you:  \n\n\nYou are offering to fund the investment only in the down payment. As such, you are not involved in the interest of the loan, with the exception of contributing to a lower interest rate. Your kids are still responsible for 100% of the interest of the loan. With real numbers, you could break it down like this:   \n\n\nTotal Home Value: $400,000.00\n\nDown Payment: $100,000.00 (25%)\n\nInterest Rate: 6.7% (on the $300,000.00 loan)\n\nBy the end of the loan (30 yr term), your kids will have paid $396,900.22 in interest, plus the $300k principle, meaning a total of $696,900.22 on the loan that you did not pay a dime towards. So, by the time the loan is paid off, your kids have paid out nearly 7x what you invested. For them to pay you 25% of the sale price, when your effective stake in the investment is now more towards the 10% mark is predatory.\n\nAs someone who is \"not rich\", you should still understand that interest is always the largest portion of any loan, especially on a high-dollar and long-term loan like a mortgage. By not contributing to the interest, your \"investment\" or \"stake\" loses value with each interest payment. Of course, if you are convincing other people to do this sort of deal on a regular basis, that explains your level of income, but is very clearly incredibly scummy.\n\nWhat you are actually doing is investing in real estate, and using your children's ignorance of how loans and investments work as the vehicle to get rich. Frankly, I hope you kick the bucket before they sell the houses. Even my own dad, the most penny-pinching Scrooge of a person I know let my wife and i buy our house cash on an interest free loan from him to avoid the predatory practices of bank loans. All he required was a written contract for the payment schedule. You really suck dude.", "So your saying if you give them money and they sell it you want money you gave them back plus interest?", "bro said 200k a year isn't rich, also yta", "\"I'm not rich\"\n\"I make 200k a year\"\n\nlmao.

There seems to be confusion, this is an equity stake investment not a loan.

If they sell and move to a different home, it is more of an investment.  \n\nSo long as everyone is on the same page, it works out great.

It can't be a true loan because the bank will be the lien holder.  If payments stopped the bank is getting the house.  If the father isn't on the title this is all semantics.\n\nSecond, your kids are going to inherit whatever you don't spend, so this money may have come to them down the road (probably several decades down the road).

If you put in $200k on an $800k house now and they have a $600k mortgage that they pay down to $400k over the next fifteen years and then they sell for 1.6 million, their net \"profit\" would be 1.2 million (1.6 - 500k remaining mortgage). With this statement, you would be expecting $200k + $300k as 25% of the net profit, which is more than 25% of the value of the house when it's sold, which would be $400k.\n\nI don't think it's necessarily unreasonable to ask for 25% ownership, but it's much more nuanced because are you going to pay 25% taxes and insurance and maintenance? Those costs don't change based on the mortgage amount. It would be more \"fair\" to reduce your percentage ownership yearly based on the fixed costs associated with the property value if you're not paying the ongoing expenses of owning the house. If taxes and insurance and maintenance are $20k per year, your part to keep this whole \"investment\" fair would be $5k. At the very least that should be deducted from your profit when it sells, so in the above scenario where $400k would be the 25% ownership share when it sells, they would pay you back 400k - 5k\u00d715, so 325k. This assumes a set tax and insurance + maintenance rate. For maintenance, it's things like siding/ paint/ roof, etc, not appliances or whatever. That would be a more \"fair\" way to handle this. \n\nAlso, if both kids took you up on your offer and bought their forever homes, do you plan to address the difference when it comes to inheritance? Say your son only gets $150k and daughter $250k and neither ever sales. I'm assuming your portion ownership will me gifted to the kid who owns the house, so will your son get an additional $100k in assets? Or maybe he should get more because your 25% ownership in his house might only be worth $300k when you pass but your 25% ownership in your daughter's house might be worth $750k. If you are a listed owner, that's there could be tax and estate implications. \n\nI think there's a reasonable way this can be done, I just don't think you've actually worked out the details very well and you are being greedy. My hope when my kids are grown is to be able to sell our bigger family home and buy myself a smaller home in a cheaper city and another smaller home (preferably 2) for my children to live in and they only have to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance, but I would still own the home and if they choose to move out likely turn it into rental property instead of selling.", "If you\u2019re such a saint, why are you even posting here?", "I think you should re read it \n\nI interpreted it differently", "That's a predatory lending scheme you've got going there.\n\nYour daughter is right.
