And as a parent, if you can easily afford it, you either help them or you don't, but you don't do this interest and equity stuff.\n\n1. Do you need equity in a house? I mean, most people want more money, but do you actually need it?\n2. If you gave them a no-interest loan, do you think they would pay you back?\n3. If 1 is false and 2 is true, would you suffer without that money while they were paying you back?\n\nIf you've ever heard of family and friends giving each other a special price on something, that's because the relationship between family and friends (including the financial relationship) is different.\n\nWhat you're doing with your kids is acting like someone who's not family.

She sells the house and clears some amount **less than $200K** after paying closing costs and the payoff on her mortgage. Then has to turn around and pay you **$250K**?

Does she have to turn to **Bank of Daddy** for another loan so she can buy another house she can't afford?\n\nNah, dude, **every single thing** about this stinks.

It\u2019s not a loan is it if you own equity in the house, you should want to help your kids it\u2019s extremely tough out there these days every older seems to have forgotten how easy and much more affordable it was to buy a house for them. I know no one is entitled to anyone\u2019s money but I can\u2019t imagine not helping a child with something like this if I could, are your kids not going to inherit from you 1 day anyway?

You don't have to just give her the money, but treating it as an investment opportunity is a bit of a shit go.

But I understand that in the context of this post, you're saying you respect your money because you've worked hard for it. \n\nAlso, did you offer your son the option to buy you out at some point?

Loan", "Bro I\u2019ve worked outside in all kinds of weather. I know trades make good money at the expense of free time and time wirh family. I\u2019m just trying to get you to understand 200k a year is rich. I\u2019m not talking down to you. I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t work hard. All I\u2019m saying is you\u2019re rich. In 2022 the national average for salary was 60k. You make over 3 times that. You\u2019re rich", "200k is the top 5% of individual incomes. What part of that is middle class?", "Loans don\u2019t entitle you to equity unless a secured loan had defaulted or a convertible note\u2019s equity option has been triggered. \n\nYour fourth grade understanding of a loans is quite apparent. \n\nYou\u2019re buying a quarter of the house; you aren\u2019t loaning them anything.", "I think they're saying you're acting more like a banker than a father, not that only bankers understand what a loan is.\n\nYTA", "Canadian here. Definitely didn't have loans explained in 4th grade math class lol.", "So if they don't sell, they keep everything, and the \"loan\" aspect would be null and void. I'd take that deal and make it a forever home. Your daughter should pay attention to that fine print.\n\nEdit to add judgement: NTA", "NTA. You don't owe them 200k. I would have been happy to partner with someone in this way in order to get a home sooner.", "I agree", "Dude everyone is making money in this situation . for OP to make money in this situation the kids house will have had to increase in value which gives them extra money . add onto this a dramatic difference in interest and its extremely hard to see how the kids are somehow being done wrong .", "Your argument here seems totally nonsensical. You say you're loaning them this money when you aren't, you seem to be investing it for a stake in the property if they sell. If either of your children take the money, buy a house, and live in it for the rest of their lives, you will never see a cent. I have no idea where you're getting this idea that just giving them the money will affect your retirement but using it to invest in the possible profits of selling a house they may never sell doesn't. It's the exact same result.", "Not of your kids id say.", "Very true. I'm just making sure that you aren't holding anything over them kinda deal. If you're being perfectly fair (as it sounds like you are), that they could buy you out if they wanted, it sounds like a good deal to me. \n\nMaintenance costs would be cherry on top.", "You own a 25% stake and you don\u2019t demand repayment unless the house is sold. \n\nThere is also no interest. You participate in the appreciation (and depreciation) of the house.\n\nThat makes you a (co-)owner, not a creditor.", "I work for rich people. My boss' bonus last year was more than I earm in a year.", "Upper part. We make more combined and I honestly don't feel like upper 10%. I still work, shopping deals and so on.", "Nah, he's definitely British and using rhyming slang.", "I think that is my son's plan.", "Oh no my kids and grandkids get a home to live in for the rest of their lives that they might not be able to afford otherwise. How sad for them.", "?", "Yeah so he is richer. 200k is top 5% of individual incomes. Which means you earn more than 95% of people. Which means you guessed it. You\u2019re rich", "70% of Americans do not even have a savings account. If you have a savings account you\u2019re already rich lol", "Hey man. You are arguing with everyone who brings up a counter point. You didn't come here to see if you were TA. You came here for some sort of validation, and to try and change other peoples minds to think more like yourself. You might want to just not post your dilemmas to the internet if you don't like how people respond to it.", "OP is from Canada where middle class is defined as anyone making between $45,000 and $120,000 a year. OP is not middle class.", "And this is why people only talk about the top 1% lol...", "I get you don\u2019t feel like it and still shop for deals and stuff but that does not change the fact that if a person makes 200k a year they are rich. Especially if as a household y\u2019all make more than tbat", "Nice, way to ignore the point. You said that gifting them this money would affect your retirement. But them taking the money and buying a house they stay in is the EXACT SAME RESULT, you get nothing back. So, why are you claiming that just giving them the money as a gift will affect your retirement when them buying a house they never sell will have the same effect on your retirement savings?", "I think \"rich\" means freedom to do anything you want. Even with this salary and no debt at all, you are not rich if you work and cannot even use your PTO because of responsibilities and workload. I am working in medical center where lots of people make much more than me and don't consider themselves rich, just well doing.", "If you can\u2019t use pto because of workload that\u2019s on you. Don\u2019t let them tell you know when you take time off. It is your time. If you make 200k a year and live within your means you can do whatever you want. I\u2019m not saying you can stop working because it\u2019s obviously the job giving you the money. But as long as you live within your means you can do whatever you want. You not taking time off is a you thing. Next time don\u2019t let them tell you know and go on a vacation. It might make you come to your senses and if there\u2019s someone making more than 200k a year and thinks they\u2019re \u201cjust doing well\u201d I beg them to go live the average Americans life for a month."]}
