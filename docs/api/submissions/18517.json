Insisting on someplace way closer to his home for the first date is pretty thoughtless(or just lazy) at best, to being on the dangerous side if he tries getting you drinks then wants you to come to his place.\n\nAnd I'd say the same thing if genders were switched. People can be crazy, and/or dangerous.", "NTA. I'm not sure why your gender is relevant, but you certainly aren't obligated to drive farther than you would like. For a first date, meeting in the middle would definitely be reasonable, and it's kind of a red flag that he's so adverse to this compromise. Btw, why do you have your distance set to include places to which you're not willing to drive?", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest something more mutual for a location.\nHe may be inexperienced but it\u2019s more notable that he\u2019s not amenable to making sure you also feel comfortable with decisions.", "NTA- He\u2019s not a catch. A catch would agree to meet in the middle of a first date. Then if the date goes well, plan a future date where he takes you to the restaurant he wants to share with you. \n\nIf he is overwhelmed with his new job, he really needs to take a hiatus on dating until he\u2019s settled into the job itself.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s not being \u201cprogressive\u201d to not want to do something, it\u2019s having standards. If you\u2019re feeling turned off, listen to that feeling. You wouldn\u2019t be wrong for declining the date altogether and moving on", "NTA - but you gotta figure out if an hour is too long of a distance. Is it just cause it\u2019s a first meeting? Like if this actually went somewhere, are you always going to be opposed to driving out to him?\n\nAre there any alternative restaurants you can suggest instead?\n\nETA: changing it to NTA from NAH cause I can already see where his attitude is going.", "So no one is the AH here. \n\nJust a suggestion, but this is how I live my life\u2026 \n\nI ask myself \u201cbased on what I know right now, is this man worth an hour drive to meet?\u201d \n\nIf the answer is no, then you don\u2019t go, and there\u2019s no point continuing the conversation, cause that is not your future husband. \n\nIf the answer is yes, then just make the drive and meet him. \n\nOnce it\u2019s over ask your self \u201cwas he worth the hour drive?\u201d \n\nIf the answer is no, there\u2019s no point in continuing the conversation, cause that\u2019s not your future husband\n\nIf the answer is yes, then he\u2019s likely worth having a discussion about a fair commute. \n\nIf at any point you feel like it\u2019s not worth the effort for you to do \u201cthe thing\u201d, then release \u201cthe thing\u201d to the universe and let her deal with it\u2026", "NAH. Maybe suggest somewhere halfway for the first date and if it goes well take it from there?", "Not the asshole!  For a first meeting and he\u2019s not willing to compromise on anything you dodged a bullet babe, keep running!! Good for you!", "NTA\nYou suggested meeting in the middle and he is insisting on something that is more convenient for him. I would think this is unreasonable even if you weren't a woman. \n\n\nFor a first meeting, something more neutral makes more sense.", "NTA and who asks someone to drive an hour for their first date?  You were right to ask to meet in the middle, and I'm doubting he's as much of a catch as you think.  I also doubt he's never had a girlfriend. It's more likely he's never had a girlfriend for long, or that he's never made it past that first date.", "Regarding it being 2023 and being progressive, that's about having the -choices- that you didn't have before when it comes to roles. \n\nYou can still enjoy having a guy \"woo\" you with his efforts if that's what you like, and there's nothing wrong with that. Many guys still like being in that role. Progress just means that if you wanted the relationship to have a different dynamic, that's cool, too.\n\nSo yeah, if you don't want to drive 1 hour (I'm guessing it's 2 hours including the return trip), don't do it.

A first meeting should be on neutral ground.", "NAH. You are NTA for wanting to keep a date within an area you're comfortable and safe in, that also won't put you out too much. That can be the difference between going on the date or not for most women.\n\nHowever he's also NTA for suggesting a nice place and wanting to impress you. You probably both think of each other as a catch but he may not realise the importance of or have the resources to meet you half way.

He's a catch who wants to take you to an awesome restaurant but needs flexibility to maintain a job that allows him to pay for finer things. And you can't be arsed to drive an hour? I drove across the literal u.s, ocean to ocean, to be with my partner for a week. Come on, either put in the bare minimum effort or accept that you need more time to mature and find yourself. Stop fishing.", "NTA. While it is the modern era and genders are \"equal,\" that means effort should be shared 50-50. If that's his favorite restaurant, it can be saved for another time. A more balanced compromise is needed for the first date.", "To be honest, I'd be wary of him in future.  I had an ex who made me drive everywhere.  We once had a function at a place that was literally at the end of my street.  Ex made me drive the 20 minutes to pick him up and drive back to the function, then drive him home afterwards.  So, an hour and 20 minutes of driving to a function I could have walked to.", "NTA.  Best to meet for the first time in a public place closer to where YOU live.   If he\u2019s legit you can go to the nice restaurant another time.   If he\u2019s a creep irl, he could be trying to lure you away from home to have you at a disadvantage.

I do think you're kinda YTA if you've been talking to this person knowing how far away he is, and not being willing to travel.\n\nI'm nervous for you, though-- travelling this far when you haven't met him before. Also, it might low-key be a pink flag that he's never dated anyone (or he says he hasn't). All that together, I would say that, yeah, keep your safety front-of-mind. Insist on meeting closer to home for the first meeting.\n\nIf he doesn't understand the importance of you feeling safe, he may not be the person for you.", "NTA but I don't understand what being a woman has to do with this. No matter what sex you are, both parties need to meet in an agreed location somewhere around the middle.", "this has nothing to do with your gender, OP.  first meeting's definitely should be somewhere neutral, and preferably in the middle. you said this person doesn't have experience dating so *maybe* it is a genuine awkward mistake, or maybe it is a play. go slow. your safety is PRIORITY. \ud83d\udda4\n\neta: NTA", "Since he says that he's very inexperienced, enlighten him. He will meet in the middle or not meet at all. Sounds like a power play, especially from a Tinder guy. \n\nNTA but when chatting with guys from dating apps, know what you want and don't compromise if you don't want to.", "Maybe I'm paranoid but this sounds sketchy to me. He's 22 and never had a girlfriend wants you to drive to his home town where you may not know your way around or have friends leaving you vulnerable.

It's a catch and release situation.", "NTA you are not a pizza. Don't deliver yourself to him.", "NTA, the first thought I had was why does he want you closer to his home? As for his \"inexperience\" with women, some men say that crap so you'll think it's cute and you'll trust him more. These are real red flags and you should just drop him off of your radar.", "He probably just excited to take you to a nice restaurant...a hour is not a big ask IMO.", "YTA. Why engage in conversation with someone if you're not willing to make the drive. Seems silly..change your distance settings.", "NTA. It's not so much that you would or would not make the drive but that you would be traveling quite a distance to meet a stranger. It's a safety thing.

It\u2019s not much difference for you to go to that place or somewhere in the middle, so if you\u2019re too busy we can just wait until you\u2019re able to meet in the middle, but it\u2019s only about a 10 minute drive different for you where it\u2019s over an hour for me.
