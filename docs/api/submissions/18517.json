Insisting on someplace way closer to his home for the first date is pretty thoughtless(or just lazy) at best, to being on the dangerous side if he tries getting you drinks then wants you to come to his place.\n\nAnd I'd say the same thing if genders were switched. People can be crazy, and/or dangerous.", "NTA. I'm not sure why your gender is relevant, but you certainly aren't obligated to drive farther than you would like. For a first date, meeting in the middle would definitely be reasonable, and it's kind of a red flag that he's so adverse to this compromise. Btw, why do you have your distance set to include places to which you're not willing to drive?", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest something more mutual for a location.\nHe may be inexperienced but it\u2019s more notable that he\u2019s not amenable to making sure you also feel comfortable with decisions.", "NTA- He\u2019s not a catch. A catch would agree to meet in the middle of a first date. Then if the date goes well, plan a future date where he takes you to the restaurant he wants to share with you. \n\nIf he is overwhelmed with his new job, he really needs to take a hiatus on dating until he\u2019s settled into the job itself.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s not being \u201cprogressive\u201d to not want to do something, it\u2019s having standards. If you\u2019re feeling turned off, listen to that feeling. You wouldn\u2019t be wrong for declining the date altogether and moving on", "NTA - but you gotta figure out if an hour is too long of a distance. Is it just cause it\u2019s a first meeting? Like if this actually went somewhere, are you always going to be opposed to driving out to him?\n\nAre there any alternative restaurants you can suggest instead?\n\nETA: changing it to NTA from NAH cause I can already see where his attitude is going.", "So no one is the AH here. \n\nJust a suggestion, but this is how I live my life\u2026 \n\nI ask myself \u201cbased on what I know right now, is this man worth an hour drive to meet?\u201d \n\nIf the answer is no, then you don\u2019t go, and there\u2019s no point continuing the conversation, cause that is not your future husband. \n\nIf the answer is yes, then just make the drive and meet him. \n\nOnce it\u2019s over ask your self \u201cwas he worth the hour drive?\u201d \n\nIf the answer is no, there\u2019s no point in continuing the conversation, cause that\u2019s not your future husband\n\nIf the answer is yes, then he\u2019s likely worth having a discussion about a fair commute. \n\nIf at any point you feel like it\u2019s not worth the effort for you to do \u201cthe thing\u201d, then release \u201cthe thing\u201d to the universe and let her deal with it\u2026", "NAH.

I would think this is unreasonable even if you weren't a woman. \n\n\nFor a first meeting, something more neutral makes more sense.", "NTA and who asks someone to drive an hour for their first date?  You were right to ask to meet in the middle, and I'm doubting he's as much of a catch as you think.  I also doubt he's never had a girlfriend. It's more likely he's never had a girlfriend for long, or that he's never made it past that first date.", "Regarding it being 2023 and being progressive, that's about having the -choices- that you didn't have before when it comes to roles. \n\nYou can still enjoy having a guy \"woo\" you with his efforts if that's what you like, and there's nothing wrong with that. Many guys still like being in that role. Progress just means that if you wanted the relationship to have a different dynamic, that's cool, too.\n\nSo yeah, if you don't want to drive 1 hour (I'm guessing it's 2 hours including the return trip), don't do it.

A more balanced compromise is needed for the first date.", "To be honest, I'd be wary of him in future.  I had an ex who made me drive everywhere.  We once had a function at a place that was literally at the end of my street.  Ex made me drive the 20 minutes to pick him up and drive back to the function, then drive him home afterwards.

This sounds as if it\u2019s not about the drive (otherwise he could have picked somewhere even closer to him) as much as it is about the restaurant. Now, I live rurally and an hour drive is NOT uncommon for a date. I wouldn\u2019t even think twice about the fact that it happened to be closer to him. I would just assume he\u2019s excited to take me to this cool place.\n\n> I excused it because he told me he is very inexperienced and never even had a girlfriend. \u2026\n\n\u2026 I dunno if this is lack of experience as much as lack of communication? Did OP actually tell him they preferred not to drive that far since the dinner will probably take as long as the commute, and maybe to save that restaurant for when they\u2019re a little further into things?\n\nOr did she just hear his suggestion and interpret it as him not wanting to drive? Did he explicitly say he wanted to go because it was 20 minutes from his house, or does OP just happen to know the distances?\n\n> Also he says he\u2019s really overwhelmed with his new job. \n\nOkay the key concern for me here \u2026 and really the crux of the matter is\u2026did he say this in response to not wanting to drive the extra time to meet in the middle? Or did he say this in a totally different conversation and OP is just us if it to try and maybe come up with a justification for why he might have asked her to do something inconsiderate?\n\nIf it\u2019s the former, he\u2019s an asshole, if it\u2019s the latter, I don\u2019t think OP is communicating clearly. \n\n\n> But I also know it\u2019s 2023 and I should be more progressive and open.\n\n\u2026. What? There\u2019s no social justice element here. What does she mean \u201cprogressive?\u201d \u201cOpen\u201d to what, inconsiderate men?

The double standard issue is in terms of how aita commenters tend to not hold the women in relationships as accountable than than the men when for example this situation if reversed going by this subs history would be far more brutal and calling him ta.

I see what you\u2019re saying. *To be fair*\u2026.. this is a sub where people often come to post abhorrent behaviours.

You\u2019re right, though, that to suggest OP divorce them is sometimes not taking the OP\u2019s perspective or commitment into account. But honest to god 99% of the time I see this recommended I am of the genuine belief that the OP would be better off divorced.
