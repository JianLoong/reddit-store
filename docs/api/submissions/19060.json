She claims she is working off the vape, but will not quit the pot. But that worries me enough, which I have brought up multiple times that she needs to quit for the baby\u2019s sake. She does other minor things, that upset me and I have had to take a step back and bite my tongue, as it is her body. The final straw was when we had a Memorial Day cook out. My other sons and their wives came over, and some of my nieces and nephews and their family, and people were drinking alcohol. My other DIL Gina, had made fruity drinks mixed with vodka and had them out in the kitchen for grabs. \n\nA little bit into the cook out, Gina pulls me aside and ask me if I see what Jillian is drinking, and she is drinking one of the mixed drinks. I was going to let it go, bc It was none of my business, but then Gina told me she was drinking a spiked tea before that, and had brought some with her. This outraged me, and I went out there and told Jillian she shouldn\u2019t be drinking. She told me it was fine to have because this is the first time she\u2019s drank her whole pregnancy.  I told her she needed to stop, and that it wasn\u2019t safe. She told me she was an adult and I couldn\u2019t tell her what to do, so I told her she was correct but she wasn\u2019t going to sit at my house and do it infront of me, if she wanted to continue she needed to leave. She got upset and said that wasn\u2019t fair bc everyone else was drinking, and I said everyone else wasn\u2019t pregnant and I couldn\u2019t watch it happen infront of me. My son and her left.\n\n Later that night my son text me saying I needed to apologize to Jillian for embarrassing her infront of everyone. I refused, so then I get a text from Jillian saying I won\u2019t be seeing them, or even my grandchild til I apologize. I haven\u2019t heard from them since Memorial Day.
