If someone is paying for it or contributing, they can ask/give opinion but ultimately it's still not their wedding (and they can withdraw funds if they want to be an ah).\n\nI have literally only come across one instance in which someone that was not the bride or groom told them what to do and it was an acceptable thing. And even then, it was a request. \n\nFriend was getting married, and one of the guests contacted her after receiving the \"save the date\" card. I was actually with the bride when she got the call, after the congrats and all the guest said \"I am going to say this bluntly but please understand I am not trying to be mean, demanding or guilt tripping. I am wondering what you're thinking as far as flowers and what food you're serving. I am only asking because I happen to be highly allergic to roses (there may have been more than one flower/plant life but I only remember the roses) and I am deathly allergic to seafood. Like, I cannot be in the same general area of seafood because the airborne particles of it can send me into anaphactic shock. While I want you to have the wedding you want, if you are going to have/serve any of this at the wedding I will not be able to come. I don't want to risk my health/life nor risk causing issues at your wedding if something happens. I completely understand if you have your heart set on any of thus, but if you want me there at all it has to be free of these things\" The bride had actually been planning on having a lot of seafood there (she didn't care about the flowers because she was already thinking about doing good quality silk ones, so that decision was easy). She told guest that she would have to talk to her fiance as she would not make a unanimous decision like that without at least consulting him. She cared more about this person being there then what food was served. Fiance, while a little disappointed bc he loved seafood, didn't care. They ended up having a allergen free wedding so this guest (not in the bridal party) could come.\n\nThis has been the only time I have seen that even so much as a request for someone else's wedding was acceptable. Partly bc of the obvious health/life issues, but also because the guest wasn't outright demanding it and, despite it being said in a ultimatum form wasn't actually an ultimatum. Just a stern request that she didn't want to beat around the bush about because of what the consequences could mean. She wouldn't have been mad (disappointed I'm sure) if they had chose to serve seafood and not have her attend. So literally, unless it's like a life or death issue (and even then), no one should be demanding anything at anyone else's wedding. \n\nThe idea another commenter had about allowing MIL to throw an adults only engagement party or something is great. Not only does she get her adults only, but you may be able.to avoid some issues with guest lists....saying that made me think though that it shouldn't be an \"engagement party\" if she is going to try and then take over the guest list. \"I invited so and so that only I know to engagement party it would be rude to not invite them to the wedding.\" If something like this could be an issue, change the idea slightly. Instead of something before the wedding, have her throw an adults only \"congrats\" party that's essentially all hers. It can even be all about how it's her son that got married and how she is showing it off and whatever, it can be all about her using you and fiance as the excuse to throw the party. Idk what FMIL is like, I have met a few women that sound like her. Rich, snobby, all about appearances and all about herself. Her kids wedding wasn't about the couple, it was about HER kid getting married to someone SHE approved of, and wasn't the wedding that SHE paid for beautiful and look at everything SHE did, and how wonderful HER kid turned out and blah blah blah. Instead of cutting ties and getting mad they decided to let her throw a party after the fact. Itnwas her party, all about her, she got to invite who.she wanted and the couple essentially allowed her to use them as props. It worked, she got so focused on her party she didn't try to control every aspect of the wedding (well as much nor did she push as hard). It worked well for them and they were happy to be used at props to make it happen. So, depending on what type of person she is, something like this could save you A LOT of stress. \n\nCongrats! Have a beautiful wedding and beautiful life with your husband, and get that massive dream picture you want and smile big when you do", "Being cruel for not having a wedding? A courthouse wedding is still a wedding. You literally can't get married without a wedding. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNTA. You and your fianc\u00e9 need to have the wedding which is right for the two of you.", "NTA...please let your in laws know now that you aren't going to be a door mat for them. The sooner you establish boundaries, the better. If they have a problem with those boundaries, tell them you won't deal with toxic behavior. I wish someone would have given me similar advice about my extremely toxic in-laws. \nI held my tongue until it got to be too much (I'm dealing with undiagnosed neuromuscular condition for the last 5 years, and he's my literal caregiver). Apparently, my husband not making his family a priority over myself and our two girls and his own mental health/physical health, was a huge problem for them. This was also during covid which we were being extremely cautious about because of my health plus me getting sick would mean more work for my already thinly spread husband. His family are covid deniers and told him that he was gullible and foolish for wanting to be cautious. Meanwhile they made no attempt to keep in contact with our girls via FaceTime or phone calls. Things blew up and we've had no contact with then since. Those bridges will never be repaired.\n\nIt took 10 years to get to that point. Don't wait, do yourself a favor and set ground rules now. You'll feel a lot better after communicating your expectations of what boundaries you want respected.", "NTA Go with the elopement and then after the honeymoon, throw some celebratory party where you can invite your family.", "NTA. The old phrase 'start as you mean to go on' really applies here. Your wedding should be what you and your husband want, not designed to meet his mother's wishes. If she's as forceful as she sounds, I don't think it would be a great idea to meet her attempts to control the wedding events with appeasement unless you plan to do that a lot. That being said, you could smooth some ruffled feather by doing something to show that a rejection of her plans isn't a rejection of her as a person. Maybe take his parents out to dinner or something?", "God yes that many could be great fun. NTA, future Mother in law would probably have a stroke over that many kids, but hey look how many children are in royal weddings, Diana had like 7 or more. It feels like MIL may want to erase how ethnic the wedding appears, hold your ground!", "No, that's an awful idea.  She will use the occasion to throw the party her way, which will be much more extravagant than you want and will be designed to upstage your \"not fancy\" wedding.  You will have no input as she is the hostess. Trust me, I had this MIL.", "Who cares? It\u2019s an invaluable life skill to learn how to deal with a less than ideal situation for 4 hours. The engagement party will be a year+ before the wedding, and OP and her fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t care what people think of their wedding as long as THEY like it. If she wants to \u2018upstage\u2019 them a year in advance, let her.", "A better idea is to have a child free 2nd wedding reception *after* your wedding that you actually care about.\n\n\nThis makes negotiating much easier, and it's up to your MIL to hold her tongue on the day that really matters to you in anticipation of the party she wants to have. Once you have your main wedding, you can then relax a lot more. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "and no one wants an actual solution. just the drama of blowing up relationships", "I also would not care.", "Welcome to having a JNMIL!
