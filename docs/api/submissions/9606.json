Your sister had other options.  Also lawyer up about the life insurance.", "NTA\n\nShe did the wrong thing and she's compelling others to also commit fraud - her boyfriend and the truck driver.  And wants you all to keep your mouths shut.", "I'd say NTA.  She can use the life insurance money to buy a new car and once the will is ready y'all can figure out who was supposed to get what and if the car wasn't solely hers, y'all can settle that matter with estate lawyer.  If there was no will than your mom would get everything by default.  If mom wasn't married to dad then after probate was done, all assets would've been decided equally amongst y'all kids.  I hate insurance fraud as well as people who think they can drive without a license or insurance without thinking about the consequences of their actions.  Grief can make you do stupid stuff, but why didn't she want to leave the car and ride with her BF to begin with?  I don't understand that logic.", "NTA\n\nBut are you willing to testify in court that your sister was the one driving.   This is unlikely to be something that the insurance company will be able to deny your sister's claim because they got an anonymous tip that she was the one driving.", "YTA sounds like your jealous and spiteful enough to put your sister in jail at an enormous time of grief and shock.", "YTA. You said yourself the truck driver wouldn't agree to the lie and she wasn't going to get away with it. You just inserted yourself to make things worse for her when you had zero to do with the crash. Personally I'd have some empathy for her, but being spiteful is cool too lol.", "NTA. Keeps our premiums down.", "NTA. I don't know why you reported the fraud. It doesn't benefit you in any way. The vehicle was part of the estate that will be divided as per your father's estate planning or local law if he had no plan. Your sister wasn't stealing your father's vehicle. She clearly shouldn't have been driving but reporting the fraud didn't put that toothpaste back in the tube.\n\nYTA for being petty. The real issue is that you're angry that your sister was the beneficiary of your father's employer provided life insurance policy.  You've manufactured a scenario in your own angry heartbroken brain that your sister somehow nefariously got her hands on those funds. That isn't true. Only your father can assign a beneficiary or beneficiaries. He chose to name a single bene and that bene is your sister.", "NTA and I would hop on over to r/legaladvice because you\u2019re gonna have more issues when it comes to the will, if he had one, or probate if he didn\u2019t.\n\nOf course, so sorry for your loss OP.", "NTA. your sister is a fraud.", "NTA- Your sister is trying to commit a fraud and trying to get other people to go along. I hope the semi-driver isn't dealing with her crap. If she wants to put hers and her boyfriend's lives in ruin, that's on her. You're not being petty. You're grieving and miss your dad. I get the feeling she only cares about what she can gain from him being deceased, and not about him or the family in general.", "NTA \n\nBut have you considered to \u201cbribe\u201d your sister into splitting your fathers estate fairly with your family or you will report her?\n\nI mean your sister has no right to be his sole beneficiary!\n\nIf she forces the sole beneficiary thing I would 100% report her as she isn\u2019t acting like a sister.

There are multiple reasons why she should not have been driving that day, and she should not have lied to the insurance company.  People go to prison for insurance fraud.  She made her choices, and she has to deal with the consequences.  You're standing up for the truth, rather than perpetuating a lie simply because you share DNA.", "NTA, the ppl telling here Y T A are the same ppl claiming insurances are so expensive. Yeah, no shit sherlock, from what money do you think they pay out the scammers? \n\nSo everybody who has a car and an insurance should be interested in not letting others scam the insurance. You ALL pay for it with your premiums.", "Pettiness, life insurance and family dynamics aside, if I was in your shoes I'd make my decision based on my legal situation, ie if you know she's committing insurance fraud, what are your legal obligations, could you get in trouble if you knew and didn't report it? \n\nIf the other driver is not on board there actually won't be any insurance fraud, it's a non-issue and YWBTAH. If she plows ahead and it's her word against the other driver's, then it's a different situation. If the other driver goes along with her, it's again a different situation.", "Do this first. Attorney can also advise you about the car insurance problem.", "It\u2019s a waste of money if he signed the form.", "And she could\u2019ve been killed the same day we lost our father. Which would\u2019ve been devastating to our family", "She wanted the car as she had been searching for one for a few months prior. It\u2019s why all us sisters agreed she should have it. But we all had no idea she had no license", "They\u2019re already investigating her TBH. The semi driver wasn\u2019t going to lie for her while he\u2019s driving a company truck.", "And yes I would testify. Of course I would. No matter what she should\u2019ve parked it. My father shouldn\u2019t have to pay for her mistakes when he\u2019s dead.", "No empathy for a narcissist and a fraud.", "Exactly!", "I reported it as it\u2019s illegal for her to be driving and for her to destroy something my father worked so hard for.\nI\u2019m not petty. I don\u2019t want a thing but MY FATHER BACK. \nI don\u2019t need his money unlike her.", "Thank you for seeing this clearly. It\u2019s is a crime and not only that but she\u2019s doing this to my deceased father not even hours after he died.", "She only gets the life insurance. The estate is vast and is split between my sisters and I. She hasn\u2019t acted like a family member in about 10 years. She used my dad in the last years of his life. Got everything from him. \nSo of course I will be the bad guy and report her. She used him but she can\u2019t use him anymore", "He signed it the day he died I believe.  I'm not a lawyer but I'd say there's room to argue he was not fully competent or under duress.  He was sick, in pain, possibly affected by medication, actually dying.  As someone who's experienced a heart attack I would say I was not in the right frame of mind to be signing legal documents.  Also if the policy was only taken out on the day he died, it may be denied anyway.  There's not harm in getting legal advice.", "Welp....  She wanted it, she got it!  Or at least what's left of it.  It's her own dumbassery that put her in the position she's in.  Insurance companies don't like liers and semi trucks have dash cams!  She woulda been caught regardless.", "His insurance premium was already paid and almost all is orange policies have coverage for unlicensed/uninsured motorists. You whine about not getting your share of an i Doran with policy but your \u201chonesty\u201d may cost you your share of your dad\u2019s care. Cut off your nose to spite your face moment.", "Then just say you hate her and that's why you did it instead of claiming you're simply being ethical.", "I mean you're chasing down reasons to further dig a deeper hole for your sister. She wasn't ever going to get away with lying and you chasing down the insurance company to snitch did nothing for anyone. It's not about ethics it was spite that made you do that.", "It is petty. If it\u2019s not hurting you, mind your own business. I don\u2019t see any reason you did it other than to hurt your sister.", "It is really sad. You kind of did lose a sister that day too. You say she wasn't really family before that, but she is definitely cut off from you now, I'm sure. I feel for you. I'm sorry for the loss of your dad. I wish you a lot of good luck and hope you'll recover mostly from the grief.", "You\u2019re not being the bad guy if you report her. \n\nI\u2019d also report the life insurance was coerced and get it rolled back into the estate. \n\nYour sister is not a nice person", "Where does it say that?", "Undue influence most likely. He wasn\u2019t in a mental capacity to revise his life insurance, that\u2019s what OP could go after.\n\nDuress is signing by force (which honestly crazy sister may have done that), undue influence would probably be the easiest claim though as he changed the policy the day before he passed.\n\nI referred OP to r/legaladvice on this. For sure above our pay grade.", "I\u2019d be forcing her to split the \u201cestate\u201d evenly or send her to jail. No $200. Do not pass go", "Alright so I don\u2019t care about the money. You all have this quite twisted her. If your father had passed away and your sister claimed insurance fraud the day he died on HIS INSURANCE you\u2019d be upset too. I has not a thing to do with money. I have my own money and make more than enough then to be spiteful over his Life insurance.", "I don\u2019t care about the life insurance. It\u2019s the fact she scamming. If you actually knew this person, you\u2019d be doing the same thing lol", "\"Oh and she gets his life insurance from his work as she did my fathers paperwork for him and only put herself as a beneficiary. 50,000$ and a car she crashed the day he died.\"  It sounds like it all happened on the same day.  Even if it didn't, no harm in seeking legal advice, imo.", "Thank you.", "That answers the questions of whether you're fully willing to bear the consequences of openly outing her for scamming the insurance. \n\nGo do what you need to do.", "Let's be honest, Insurance companies don't care about you, so you shouldn't care about them.\n\nYou claim you aren't being petty but\n\n>If you actually knew this person, you\u2019d be doing the same thing lol\n\nBut this tells me you are doing this just because you don't like her... You are well within your right to do this because you don't like her. But then don't go around saying you aren't petty.\n\nYou already know that the semi truck driver isn't going to testify that the BF was driving so she'll be caught anyway. Literally doesn't matter what you do.", "It says she lied to the insurance company about the car on the day he died. It only says she did the paperwork for the life insurance policy, no date is specified and it really doesn\u2019t read as if it was the same day.", "There\u2019s a period after the word beneficiary. No where does OP imply the life insurance forms were signed the day he died. But go ahead and pay an attorney\u2026.named beneficiaries and PODs, joint owners on accounts, etc\u2026. override wills.", "Possibly, it's not the question for judgement anyway.", "It\u2019s relevant to the judgement though. Especially as you\u2019re suggesting getting a lawyer to contend something based on a misunderstanding of OPs post.", "If a fraudster sister becomes the only beneficiary of your father's life insurance policy then, imo, the sensible thing to do is seek legal advice.  She's already attempted insurance fraud once with the car.  I'm not a lawyer, are you?  That's why you get legal advice.", "YTA. You're doing this because you don't like your sister.", "YTA. Keep your mouth shut. It's your sister, she made a mistake in her grief. The car was totalled whoever was driving, and insurance should pay out. If she was drinking, or there were other mitigating circumstances,  maybe. But in this case, your just being malicious.", "1) Nothing you can do about the life insurance as beneficiaries occur outside of the estate in addition the policy may not pay out regardless depending upon how the group policy was set up (could have a restriction that the death occur would on company time).\n\n2) She won't get the payout for the auto accident as coverage, upon death, only extended to an authorized representative of the estate until the policy ends and, as of right now, there is no representative of the estate so the car is technically not insured.\n\n3) Even if #2 is invalid, as she has no license, the insurance won't cover the claim as a) the vehicle owner did not grant permission to use the car and b) driving without a license is a crime and thus insurance is generally not held responsible\n\nYTA and just stay out of it. The moment the fraud is detected (which won't take much as I'm sure the truck driver will mention they were asked to lie about it), they are no longer responsible for her side of the claim and can seek any damages FROM her.", "How do you know the life insurance was coerced?  Wasn't it through work?  He probably  signed that years ago", "Yeah this is just not a legal claim at all. You're misreading op there's nothing indicating the life insurance was changed the day or day before he died. If it was changed the day before he died when he was fine and before his \"heart exploded\" there's nothing that suggests undue influence or duress. There's nothing that suggests the life insurance beneficiary was changed either and in almost every instance that actually requires a bureaucratic process that takes several days - it sounds like she was named the beneficiary on his paperwork from the get go. There's really nothing at all here...", "That isn't how English works. Explains alot on this sub.", "I am a lawyer and yeah this is a ridiculous take."]}
