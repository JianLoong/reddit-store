He is more interested in his social life than he is in his kids\u2019 security. He moved another woman in when you kids barely know her, and that\u2019s irresponsible. \n\nIt\u2019s not great that you were rude to her, but I can certainly understand it. I feel sad for you and your little siblings, who must be devastated that their mother moved away and left them.", "Your dad sounds like a real peach with that \u201cI had you young so I can date 20 year olds.\u201d Wow", "NTA, start calling her 'sis'. maybe he will get the hint.", "NTA your dad is dating someone barely an adult, 12 years younger than him.\n\nPersonally, I would go the petty route, and constantly remind her and him of that.\n\n\"Hey X, isn't it weird that you and I are closer in age than you and my dad? Funny, right?\"\n\n\"Man, my dad sure likes them young, I wonder how long until he replaces you with another 20yo?

You don't have to get comfortable with your dad creeping on 21 year old women. And you don't have to call them step-mom. That's straight up inappropriate. Your dad is a huge AH. \n\nWork on your plans to get out of there as soon as possible after you turn 18. Get a job and focus on saving money your father can't access. He's creating a toxic household.\n\nCan you go live with your bio mom?", "NTA you don't have to do anything. Only five years older than you? Gross", "I would have told dad sorry I'll do better with the next one lol.", "Your dad dating a 21 yr old is creepy.  \n\nMaybe you shouldn't have snapped but she is never going to be a mother to you.  It sounds like she wasn't that upset, your father was.\n\nDad is not hearing you.  \n\nNTA", "Your Dad is the AH in trying to force his girlfriend of 6 months on to you all, I don\u2019t get why a 33 year old would be interested in a 21 year old.", "NTA but your \"father\" sucks.

Your dad is creepy af for having a live in gf closer to your age than his.", "NAH except for dad. Your dad moves on quick. He has a lot of nerve moving someone new in so soon and expecting y\u2019all to be on board. However it does sound like this woman is going to be wife number 3. I think it\u2019s a good sign this woman didn\u2019t take what you said personally and it sounds like she\u2019s trying to be your friend. If she has patience maybe you will come around but at the very least it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s the one pushing. This is your dad, who by the way sounds ridiculous. Wonder how long wife number 3 has till your dad replaces her with a younger version.", "NTA you\u2019re a kid and this is a messed up situation. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to handle it much better. The girlfriend is still probably going to try to do things with you, and she was right not to get offended. It\u2019s not about her. It\u2019s about the fact you just suffered a major loss. 6 months is not a long time and you need your dad\u2019s support. You are not ready to be meeting new girlfriends and I think that\u2019s more than fair.", "Ew your dad is a creep, NTA", "NTA. I don't understand the comments saying gf isn't the AH here. She shouldn't be forcing herself on you, especially considering that you have only just met.", "Im lost who is the step mom", "NTA, it\u2019s understandable to be upset over such a shift in your family structure, and to see your father\u2019s New Romantic interest as an interloper.\n\nHis girlfriend was probably just trying to be nice, and hopefully is insightful enough to understand why you\u2019re upset. \n\nYour father has the right to move on romantically but he needs to realise he\u2019s putting you through some big emotional changes and needs to tread more carefully. Introducing a new girlfriend just after a divorce isn\u2019t the smartest idea, and really he didn\u2019t need to take that step with a partner he\u2019s been with for only six months", "NTA - The age difference is weird. Your dad's expectations are weirder. She is almost your peer. Big sister range. Definitely not \"step mom\".... besides yall just got to meet her a few weeks ago and she already moved in? Your dad doesn't seem to understand how damaging that can be to you and your younger siblings. Yikes.", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing your dad\u2019s girlfriend is trying to build something like a relationship with you and has no idea what that should even begin to look like, hence pushing at you. Which is not in and of itself an asshole move, if she takes you at your word and changes tack. If she\u2019s otherwise not too bad to be around, you might want to consider apologising - not for what you said, which was true and needed to be said, but for snapping at her. The aim is just to make your own life a little more comfortable, for the however long you\u2019re both in each other\u2019s lives - there are more useful hills to die on.   \n\n\nYour dad, however, is a humongous AH. He\u2019s a walking object lesson in What Not To Do.", "NTA and saying you have to deal with Younger stepparents because dad got you young is ridicilous. Yes, Younger in a way like my dad got me young, so his partner is also younger than the average parent and not younger in a way like dating someone who is 5 years older than your own kid. What even is that statement. \nYour dad has the right to date someone younger and you have the right to dislike that person/not see her as a parental figure. Its totally fine to tell her that as long as you are respectful in general to her..the same counts for the new girlfriend of course.", "NTA. Your dad is the problem here; he needs to be patient and not expect you to automatically bond with his new gfs. I don't think his gf is an AH either; it sounds like she's trying to make an effort with you. Maybe give her a chance? She might not be a stepmom, but she could be someone nice to have in your life.", "NTA. Neither is that woman though and you don\u2019t need to be so unkind to her. She\u2019s doing her best to build a relationship with you, if you don\u2019t want that, then communicate that without getting angry or snapping. \n\nYour dad is TA for dating someone 5 years older than you and expecting you to feel like she is in anyway an important adult figure in your life. Just because she\u2019s his girlfriend doesn\u2019t mean she has to be anything to you. As long as she isn\u2019t overstepping and isn\u2019t trying to parent you though, you should treat her with a basic level of respect and care.", "INFO: so she\u2019s 21?\n\nThere\u2019s not much that could change my NTA vote, I\u2019m just curious.  A 21 year old trying to give marching orders to a 16 year old is just asking for trouble.  I\u2019m not saying flout her every command, she does technically have more life experience than you and being involved with your father gives her some element of power.\n\nBUT, I\u2019d completely understand you not respecting her *every* word. There are some pretty smart people in their early 20s, but in general I don\u2019t think 21 year olds have the authority of knowledge and experience to be a second step parent to anyone, on average.\n\nJust keep your head down and wait until you leave the house. Try to be nicer to her, but politely decline to do as she says and just say you\u2019ll wait until you hear the same order from your dad.  If your dad doesn\u2019t respect that, he\u2019s just fucking up. \n\nI think there is a way for you and her to have a healthy relationship that respects authority boundaries, but it has to be earned with time. I\u2019ll just leave with the advice of \u201ctry not to be overly aggressive or antagonistic towards her\u201d. Just politely decline to bend to her wishes.", "NTA.", "Soft YTA.\n\nIt doesn't sound like she did anything to warrant you snapping at her. It sounds like she's trying, and it doesn't sound like you want to give her a chance. Over and above that, if she and your dad do get married, legally she will be your stepmom.\n\nHowever, I understand that change is difficult and there's nothing wrong with voicing your concerns, but not in a rude manner when it wasn't deserved.", "INFO: is she asking you to call her \u201cstepmom\u201d?   From your post, it sounds like she\u2019s making an effort to build a connection with her boyfriend\u2019s kids, which is a hard thing to do.   Sounds like you were pretty rude when you shut her down, and for no apparent reason other than you don\u2019t approve of your father dating younger women, which is your own baggage.\n\nHas she done anything to warrant that reaction?  Is she a bad person that you don\u2019t want to be around?   Or is this misplaced anger at your father?", "YTA. Full right not to call your dad's GF stepmom or view her as such.  However, there is no reason to be rude. It does not seem that she did anything wrong for you to react that way", "YTA but I sense there is a more emotional background here. \n\nProbably you should have a talk with your dad about your feelings, not take it on his GF.", "Mild YTA\n\nIt\u2019s sounds as though your dad\u2019s gf is trying to be friendly to you - not take on a parental role. Unless this changes, I\u2019d recommend trying to separate your relationship with her with that of others in your life. Having a good relationship to the gf doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re disloyal to your mother or stepmother.", "Soft yta, if u were like 11 or 12 or 13 id say N T A but at 16 ur supposed to be more aware of ppl\u2019s feelings", "I'm gonna go with a soft YTA. It seems like you let your emotions burst, which isn't the end of the world.  I do think that an apology to your dad's gf would be a nice gesture, and maybe an explanation as to how you actually feel. You said you feel weird about the age difference, so actually having a conversation about that might smooth things out.\n\nWho knows? Maybe the gf will agree with you and dump him lol jk but y'never know.", "YTA for being rude to her, you\u2019re allowed to not like her but you\u2019re not allowed to be an A-Hole to her for no reason.", "YTA. Somebody wants to be nice to you and hang out with you and you snap back cos it feels weird?\n\nJust say \"no, thanks\" and be done with it.", "YTA \n33 and 21 isnt weird. They are both adults and it seems like she just tried to be nice to you. ( Judging on the given context ofc)\nIf she even reacted kind of chill to you being rude, that is another plus on her side.\n\nYou did not rly make it sound like there was any reason to be rude to her. You could just have said, how you feel about it. ( that it is too early, that you have a mom allrdy or whatever)\nShe is probably aware, that she wont be your true mom, because you allready have one. But is it so bad, if she tries to get along with you and maybe help rising your dad's kids? This is also not an easy situation for him...\n\nBut your das is TA too. He brought her to you and your siblings way too early and he should be more understanding, that this is a tough time for all people included. He cant force that other woman onto you and 5 years agedifference is nothing. You are allmost an adult aswell and seing someone that close to your age as anything else than a friend/ sister or sometging like that is nearly impossible.\n\nAlso that he said you need to get to be used to step momS ( plural) is actually concerning...\n\nStay strong and try to enjoy your life eventough this is a hard time.... There will come better times in the future =]", "YTA\n\nBut I get why you are. Because your situation sucks. Your Dad was 17 when  he had you... so no step is going to be that much older than you. And 12 years is a big difference but not insane... yeah. That sucks.", "Soft YTA. Truth is she eventually could become your stepmom. Being a stepmom is not a matter of choices, if they marry she will actually be your step mom. I think your father did things wrong but you should listen to your mother: you need to at least show a bit of respect. You can\u2019t get respect if you don\u2019t give it out.
