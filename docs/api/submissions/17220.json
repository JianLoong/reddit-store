What even is that statement. \nYour dad has the right to date someone younger and you have the right to dislike that person/not see her as a parental figure. Its totally fine to tell her that as long as you are respectful in general to her..the same counts for the new girlfriend of course.", "NTA. Your dad is the problem here; he needs to be patient and not expect you to automatically bond with his new gfs.

Just because she\u2019s his girlfriend doesn\u2019t mean she has to be anything to you.

A 21 year old trying to give marching orders to a 16 year old is just asking for trouble.  I\u2019m not saying flout her every command, she does technically have more life experience than you and being involved with your father gives her some element of power.\n\nBUT, I\u2019d completely understand you not respecting her *every* word. There are some pretty smart people in their early 20s, but in general I don\u2019t think 21 year olds have the authority of knowledge and experience to be a second step parent to anyone, on average.\n\nJust keep your head down and wait until you leave the house. Try to be nicer to her, but politely decline to do as she says and just say you\u2019ll wait until you hear the same order from your dad.  If your dad doesn\u2019t respect that, he\u2019s just fucking up. \n\nI think there is a way for you and her to have a healthy relationship that respects authority boundaries, but it has to be earned with time.

When I first met my husband, the first thing we did was establish a boundary. He told me that he's not looking for a mother for his kids since they have one. When we got married, I gave his kids (who were a little older then) the choice of what they wanted to call me. I explained my own position I was in when my dad remarried and felt like his wife wasn't my stepmother because I was basically grown, and she didn't contribute to raising me. So I was ok with whatever position they wanted to take.  They said I could be step mom, but that 'mom' was reserved for their mother. I was fine with it. \n\n You are correct to set the boundary and expectation, especially if your father won't. I think your mom is right in that you do need to apologize, as there is a WAY to do that respectfully. Take advantage of the GF wanting to spend time with you and use that as a time to have a respectful conversation. I'm pretty sure she'll be more than understanding since it's probably weird for her, too. NTA.", "NTA. Your dad is kind of selfish, apparently. If the divorce was recent, and he still has the nerve to have that lady move in, that tells you two things:\n\n1-He is not thinking about how this can disrupt your healing process as a daughter when it comes to the divorce. How this affects you, how uptight things can get. Only thinking about himself...\n\n2-He seems to be VERY accelerated, something may be fkd up with his decision making and perception of things, he seems the kind of person that takes decisions very lightly, impulsively. I mean... moving someone into your house so quickly says a lot about him, people who do these things so fast end up regretting it. \n\nIt is understandable if you snapped, even if it was not the girlfriend's fault. I just think you should find better ways to channel your emotions. And if your dad at least gives a fk a little, he has to listen to what you have to say, how you feel. If not good at listening, then it's better to just hang in there until you are older, to get a job and to move out.", "Your are NTA and the girlfriend isn't TA either.  If she asked you to call her stepmom, that would be weird, but it sounds like she is just trying to build a relationship with you, which is okay.  But it's also okay if you aren't ready for that.  You are a teenager and the adults in this situation should expect this to be awkward and emotional for you.  \n\nYour dad is TA here for dating a 21 year old and not expecting it to be weird for you.  And for moving her in so soon.  \n\nIf I were you, I'd recommend just being honest with the girlfriend.  I would apologize for snapping at her.  But I would also tell her you aren't ready to bond with her that much yet and to please give you some space.  Tell her that the age difference is weird for you.  Tell her that you might be willing to form a relationship (if you are) but that it would need to be more like friends than stepmom/stepchild.  If she can respect your boundaries, it might be possible to have a good relationship with her going forwards even if it isn't a close relationship.  And more importantly, if she respects your boundaries and sees that your father doesn't, that might be the end of their relationship right there.\n\nI think the real issue here is with your dad but it honestly doesn't sound like he's ready to act like the only true adult in this situation, so I'm giving recommendations that I think will make your life easier.

And he believes that there is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t either. \n\nThe fallacy in his line of thinking is that he\u2019s not stopping to think that you\u2019re still growing up.

And in this situation he is definitely not thinking too thoroughly about how all this change is affecting you. And I don\u2019t want to sound depressing, but parents tend to be stuck in their ways, and this might never change, and your dads gf might never go away.
